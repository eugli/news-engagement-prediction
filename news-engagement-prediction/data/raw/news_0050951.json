Organs donated usually are intended for transplants into other people. When donating your body to science, your remains are mostly used to advance the education of medical students.\nBruce Wainman, the Director of Education Program in Anatomy at McMaster University told The Morning Edition with Craig Norris there are many reasons why people donate their body to science.\nLISTEN: McMaster University anatomy professor Bruce Wainman \"Most people are looking to do the last best thing with their life,\" said Wainman. \"It seems to many people a culmination of a life, usually, of generosity.\"\nMost people see donating their bodies as 'the last best thing with their life,' says Bruce Wainman, director of the education program in Anatomy at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ont. (McMaster University)\nReligious grounds? Eileen Hipfner of Toronto had been a registered organ donor but had never considered donating her entire body to science until hearing a presentation where family members expressed their pride for the incredible gift they had made by donating their body.\n\"I decided to donate my body to the Department of Anatomy at the University of Toronto , so that it could be used to train tomorrow's physicians,\" she said.\nHipfner inspired her parents to do the same. But the question of religious appropriateness came up. So the family consulted their priest about whether body donations would be permitted for observant Catholics.\n\"He told them that it was one of the most Catholic things they could choose to do, but their remains would have to be ... interred in a consecrated place,\" said Hipfner.\nHow is the body used? Wainman, who was a student himself at McMaster, said he was \"blown away\" during his first experience in the anatomy program when he started to work with a real body instead of relying on drawings in an anatomy text book.\n\"Some [bodies] are used for teaching surgical procedures, which is a fantastic thing to do. Most are used for educational purposes. We also do some research on various types of things,\" said Wainman.\nDonations at UW are mainly used to teach anatomy to kinesiology students. Optometry and fine arts students also use \"donors\" in their studies. (photo provided by University of Waterloo Kinesiology department)\nAt the University of Waterloo, Jeremy Roth, a Senior Demonstrator for Anatomy said they mainly use \"donors\" to teach kinesiology students, with a focus on how muscles move the body. But they also use body labs to teach physiology to optometry students and fine arts students who are doing life drawings.\n\"We will have the donors dissected to show muscles, arteries and nerves that are relevant to the curriculum we're trying to teach,\"said Roth.\n\"So all the donors come as whole bodies and then we perform dissections to demonstrate.\"\nThe end Both Wainman and Roth said the students learn not only anatomy, but also about altruism and the generosity of the donor.\nAfter the body study is completed at the University of Waterloo, the cremated remains are placed in a designated plot at Parkview Cemetery in Waterloo. At McMaster, the remains are given back to the family if they request, or placed in a communal crypt.\nIf not, the body is cremated, the ashes placed in an urn and then stored in a crypt at the university, bringing the donor's life and death journey to a restful end.", "external_links": ["http://www.uoguelph.ca/humananatomy/Body_Donation.shtml", "https://uwaterloo.ca/kinesiology/resources-services/school-anatomy/body-bequeathal", "https://med.uottawa.ca/department-innovation/division-clinical-and-functional-anatomy/body-bequeathal-program/procedures-donation-body", "https://fhs.mcmaster.ca/anatomy/bequeathals.html", "http://anatomy.utoronto.ca/body.htm"], "published": "2017-02-19T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:30:57.382+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
