And the reason for his pleasure as MSD's sacking will leave you ROFL\nMS Dhoni. Pic/Atul Kamble \nIn a move that left everyone shocked,  MS Dhoni was sacked as skipper of Rising Pune Supergiant on the eve of high-profile player auction for the T20 spectacle. \nThis was the the first time in his  illustrious career that the 35-year-old was sacked as a captain. He was replaced by Steve Smith.  \nFormer India skipper Mohammad Azharuddin has slammed the Rising Pune Supergiant management for the manner in which double World Cup-winning captain was removed from captaincy of the IPL franchise.  Pune finished seventh in their maiden appearance last year at the IPL, and Azharuddin felt it was not correct to put all the blame on Dhoni. \n\nFormer Kingâ€™s XI Punjab team mentor and current Head of Cricket Operations and Brand Ambassador Virender Sehwag during the IPL Auction 2017 in Bengaluru on Monday.

And you won't believe the reason for his happiness. \nViru's gyaan about this issue also is as witty as his usual Twitter posts. \nSehwag, who is IPL franchise KXIP's head of cricket operations, said, \"I am happy that he isn't captain because maybe now my team, Kings XI Punjab, can beat this Pune team.\"\nOn a serious note, Sehwag said that it was a sad decision. \"On a serious note, I believe that this is an internal decision of the franchise but he is one of the best ever captains India has ever had,' Sehwag added while speaking at the 'SporTale', a sports-themed literary festival in Pune.\n\nMS Dhoni and Virender Sehwag. File Pic/AFP \nThe move to sack Dhoni as RPS skipper came after he ended his innings as skipper in international cricket after he quit as Team India captain in the limited overs format.\nDhoni, who had stepped down as India's limited-overs captain to snap his international run as skipper earlier this year, will, however, continue to be a part of the Pune franchise as a player.\n\"Dhoni has not stepped down. We have appointed Steve Smith as the skipper for the upcoming season. Frankly speaking, we did not have a good last season and we wanted someone young to lead the side and revamp it ahead of the upcoming season 10,\" Rising Pune Supergiants owner Sanjiv Goenka had told PTI.\n\"I have the highest regard for MS Dhoni as a leader and a person. Dhoni continues to be an integral member of our team. He is supportive of the decision keeping the franchise's best interests in mind,\" Goenka added.\n\nRising Pune Supergiants captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni reacts as his teammate Irfan Pathan is run out during the match between Kolkata Knight Riders and Rising Pune Supergiants at the Eden Gardens Cricket Stadium in Kolkata during IPL 2016.
