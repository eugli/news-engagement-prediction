Getty Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Since Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway mistakenly awarded Moonlight ’s Best Picture trophy to La La Land on Sunday night, Oscar watchers everywhere have wondered how exactly that whole situation happened. Accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, which oversees Oscar voting, has since apologized for the debacle and explained that there were two sets of envelopes (one on either side of the stage), but none of that explains how the wrong envelope got in Warren’s hands. Below, a sampling of the likeliest theories about what will likely go down as one of the most memorable moments in Oscar history. 1. An accountant handed them the wrong envelope by accident. Given that PWC has come clean about having two sets of envelopes, this makes the most sense. A close-up shows that Warren was holding one that reads “Actress in a Leading Role,” so even if Emma had hers in hand the whole time (more on that later), there was another one floating around backstage, and that one is the one that made it into Warren’s hands. Unfortunately, this is also the most boring explanation. Envelope in Warren Beatty’s hands read “ACTRESS IN A LEADING ROLE” when announcing Best Picture. https://t.co/naq6LCfSrE #Oscars pic.twitter.com/YmXWXcudfu — ABC News (@ABC) February 27, 2017 2. An accountant handed them the wrong envelope on purpose. OK, now we’re talking. The Ringer’s Rodger Sherman theorizes that accountants angry about the lack of critical praise for the Ben Affleck movie The Accountant , about a hot accountant doing way sexier stuff than accountants normally do, sabotaged the show to destroy PricewaterhouseCoopers’s reputation. Warren Beatty played along because he’s only won one Oscar in his long career. It sounds crazy until you remember that Suicide Squad also has one Oscar. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 3. Warren took the wrong envelope on purpose. The problem with this theory is that it assumes that (1) Warren knew what was in the Best Picture envelope and (2) he gives any shits about who wins Best Picture. Warren Beatty is Dick Tracy. Warren Beatty does not care who wins Best Picture. (Though he does probably wish his movie Rules Don’t Apply got at least one nomination, and this would be a great way to get revenge.) 4. Emma Stone left her envelope lying around backstage. PWC’s confirmation that there were two Best Actress envelopes makes this unlikely as well, as does this photo that backs up Emma’s assertion that she had her envelope in hand the whole time. But who’s to say Warren Beatty doesn’t have magical powers that allow him to summon objects out of other people’s hands? Getty Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 5. Leonardo DiCaprio was having his revenge. Leo has a long, tortured history with the Academy, who only awarded him a Best Actor trophy last year for what is at best his ninth greatest movie. Handing Warren the wrong envelope would be such a fun kick in the Academy’s pants. But unless Leo had a second envelope in his possession, he couldn’t have done this, since his first one went into the hands of Emma Stone. 6. The Academy engineered the mishap for ratings. Like everything else that’s not streaming video, the Oscars broadcast is having trouble attracting eyeballs . But if producers were going to pull a stunt like this for ratings, they would have done it earlier in the night. By the time the mistake was corrected, a lot of people had already turned off their TVs because they thought they’d heard the last award announced (and the show was already 40 minutes over its three-hour run time). Why ruin the credibility of Hollywood’s most prestigious awards show for one viral moment? 7. Matt Damon did it to get back at Jimmy Kimmel for all that teasing about The Great Wall . The faux Matt/Jimmy rivalry was the joke that just wouldn’t die, so who would really be surprised to find out that they drew it out until the very last second of the broadcast? No one. 8. It was M. Night Shyamalan. I wrote the ending of the academy awards 2017. @jimmykimmel we really got them! — M. Night Shyamalan (@MNightShyamalan) February 27, 2017 9. It was Russia.
