Nobody should be doing this grievance, oppression bullshit malarkey. Everyone should just get on with achieving everything that they can in their lives... Everybody has bad shit happen to them, and you either use it to turn yourself into a star or you become a victim. And I don’t have time for victims. \nThat was Milo Yiannopoulos a few months ago , Before he lost his book contract, his CPAC keynote, and his job at Breitbart. \nWednesday, Milo announced that, oops, Milo is a victim . The victim of a “cynical witch hunt.” The victim of “deceptive” video editing. And “a child abuse victim.” \nNow isn’t that odd. \nMilo has built a career as the world’s biggest troll by taunting victims in the meanest possible ways, then berating them for being crybabies when they complain. \nMilo last year, on women who are victims of sexual assault: \n“Someone touched my breast, how awful” — what’s a woman really telling you there? She telling you that someone was sexually interested in her. It’s a sort of bragging, isn’t it? \nMilo today after losing his job. \nBetween the ages of 13 and 16, two men touched me in ways they should not have. \nReally, Milo, aren’t you just telling us that someone was sexually interested in you. It’s a sort of bragging, isn’t it? \nAnd “deceptive video editing”? Dude! You worked for Breitbart. Breitbart was built on that . \nBreitbart made its name pushing the misleadingly-edited-and-and-in-part-actually-faked videos that destroyed the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), a non-profit organization that had advoctaed for poor people in the country for forty years! \nBreitbart is the outfit that cut up Shirley Sherrod’s 2010 NAACP speech to make her seem like she was saying exactly the opposite of what she said . She was forced to resign. But when the truth came out, the NAACP, White House officials, and the United States Secretary of Agriculture all apologized for the firing, and Sherrod was offered a new position with the USDA. She sued Brietbart, which settled out of court, the only public statement being that “The parties regret the harm that Mrs. Sherrod suffered as a result of these events.” \nBreitbart destroyed careers and organization with deceptive video editing. The Milo pedophilia video was not edited. Deceptively or otherwise. Watch it . Not a single edit. Milo says: \nThere are certainly people capable of giving consent at a younger age. I certainly consider myself to be one of them. \nGee Milo. It sounds to me like you were saying that you were certainly capable of giving consent at a younger age. \nI’m grateful for Father Michael [a Catholic priest Milo claims to have had sex with as a teenager]. I wouldn’t give nearly such good head if it wasn’t for him. \nGood one Milo! Hahaha. \nSo Milo, tell us. We are dying to know. Did you really feel yourself to be a sexual abuse victim all this time, and you just lied about it so you could contrast your macho sexual bravado with your portrayal of female sexual abuse victims as a bunch of pathetic whiners? Or did you engage in consensual sex with adults when you were a child, and are now telling lies about how it was really abuse in order to save your career. \nIt’s got to be one or the other.
