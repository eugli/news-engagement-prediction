(Photo: Kirby Lee, USA TODAY Sports) \nHOUSTON – New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady did not confirm a report that his mother is dealing with an undisclosed health issue, but reiterated that this year has been trying. \n“Yeah, it’s personal with my family,” Brady told reporters Wednesday in a news conference. “I’m just hoping everyone is here on Sunday to share a great experience. It has been a tough year. Every family goes through different things. My family has always been a great support system for me.” \nCSN New England reported Tuesday night that Brady’s mother, Galynn, has been dealing with health issues for the past 18 months. The report indicated that she had shown improvements recently, but that an illness was still “a major concern.” \nBrady said Tuesday that his mother hasn’t attended one game this season and that his father, Tom Brady Sr., had only been to one – something he acknowledged was “atypical.” \nMORE COVERAGE: Kyle Shanahan developed own style as one of NFL's craftiest playcallers \nBrady said he didn’t know yet if his parents would be able to travel to Houston from their home in California for Super Bowl LI against the Atlanta Falcons. \nThe questions started to come after Super Bowl Opening Night on Monday, when he became emotional answering a question about who his hero is. \n“My dad,” he said then, tears welling in his eyes. \nIt had been rare for Brady to show emotion in news conferences, but on Wednesday, he elaborated on what it would mean for his family to attend Sunday's game. \n“I hoping everyone will be able to make it,” Brady said. “It’s a great game because it’s the final game of the year and it’s the culmination of a lot of things. It’s the Super Bowl. It’s great for your team, but there’s also a lot of people who have made an investment in you. They spent their time and energy on their weekends working their tail off all week for two days. And then Sunday comes along and they do everything to watch the Patriots. \n“They’ve made an investment in us and we want to reward that. We want our fans to know that all the time they spent cheering for us has paid off. And for our families, it’s the same thing. I don’t get home until 6:30, 7 at night, and my wife does everything for the kids. In the morning, I’m out the door at 6 o’clock. And when you do that for five months, it gets tiring for them, and you owe so much to your family, and your wife, and your spouse, and the people who support you because they’re pulling the burden at home for us to live our dreams. \n“Our dream is so important, but it’s not their dream. They’re sacrificing a lot for their love of what we do. And you want to be able to reward them as well.” \nFollow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes . \nPHOTOS: Patriots, Falcons practice for Super Bowl LI Facebook Posted!
