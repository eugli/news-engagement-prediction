US troops in Florida, the President said: \"All over Europe, it's happening.\n\"It's gotten to a point where it's not even being reported.\n\"And, in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn't want to report it.\n\"They have their reasons, and you understand that.\"\nTrump did not give examples of the terror attacks he believes have not been reported, or any reason as to why they would be purposefully ignored.\nUS President Donald Trump accused the media of not reporting on terror attacks (Photo: AFP) But the White House later released a list of 78 terror attacks since 2014 which \"did not receive adequate attention from Western media sources.\"\nThe list includes the appalling attacks in Paris, Brussels and Tunisia which killed hundreds, including Brits, and received blanket news coverage worldwide.\nOne of the incidents mentioned is the tragic killing of Brit backpackers Mia Ayliffe-Chung and Tom Jackson last year in Queensland, Australia. \nPolice investigating the attack have found no links to terrorism.\nFrenchman Smail Ayad, 29, has been charged with murder and is being held in a mental health unit.\nHere, MirrorOnline addresses each attack, and offers at least one
