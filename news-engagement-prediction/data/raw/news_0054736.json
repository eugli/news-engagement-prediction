Or sit down ... who even knows anymore. \nSee, it's like this — every so often a new study comes out declaring that sitting for hours on end is essentially your ticket to an early grave. So then you read it, become increasingly terrified and make a conscious decision to stand more often. SEE ALSO: Netflix cheating is a phenomenon that can put a pause on your relationship \nBut just when you finally get your standing desk approved by your office manager, another study declares that standing for prolonged periods is equally as threatening to your health. \nSo where does that leave us, scientists? Alternating between chairs and standing desks? Taking bathroom breaks every five minutes to ensure we get our 10,000 steps in? Jiggling our legs at earthquake-inducing speeds to get that blood circulating? We're just trying to stay alive, here. Please, take a seat \nAlthough standing desks are all the rage now, back in 2002, standing was NOT consideredsmart. A study discovered some serious health risks associated with standing for more than 8 hours, ranging from lower back pain, foot aches, preterm birth and even spontaneous abortions. In 2005, prolonged standing at work was also linked to an excess risk of varicose veins. Yikes. \nThere's also this terrifying July 2014 study about health risks associated with prolonged standing at work that will make you feel better each time you drop to your seat. In good news for all the sitters out there, a 2015 study by the International Journal of Epidemiology concluded that sitting time isn't linked to a risk of death (or as they put it, \"all-cause mortality\"). Phew. Instead, a lack of physical activity is the problem. \nThe latest study to join the confusing pile comes from a team of Australian and British scientists, who found that — despite all the fretting by daily cubicle inhabitants across the globe — sitting might not be so bad after all, at least when it comes to diabetes. \nIn a January paper , published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, the researchers said there was little evidence linking sitting with incident diabetes over 13 years. The study involved about 4,800 British civil servants, who were on average 44 years old and didn't have diabetes or heart or circulatory problems at the beginning. \nEmmanuel Stamatakis, lead author of the paper and an associate professor at the University of Sydney, suggested that we think about sitting at work not so much as a health risk, but as a reflection of our sedentary lifestyles. \"Rather than being the 'new smoking,' we need to think of sitting as an important part of the wider problem of physical inactivity,\" he wrote Tuesday on The Conversation . \nSo by all means, sit down at work, but at least hit the gym and do some cardio later on. Now, stand up \nThe craze around standing desks started slowly.
