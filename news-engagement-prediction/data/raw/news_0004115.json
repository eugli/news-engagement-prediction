Better yet, they're continuing to get smarter. The Google Home device can tell you where you left things — assuming you told it first.

With a simple, \"Alexa, start the seven-minute workout,\" the smart speaker will walk you through a quick workout to get your blood pumping as you start your morning. \nPlace Your Starbucks Order \nAnyone with an Amazon speaker can place a Starbucks order using their voice. The downside: You won't be able to get too fancy every day. Instead, coffee drinkers can link their Starbucks account and set a \"usual\" order. After that, just say, \"Alexa, tell Starbucks to start my order\" and then pick it up at your local store. \nFind Your Keys or Phone \nNo more tearing the house apart to find your keys in the morning. Tell your Google Home, \"OK Google, remember I put my keys in the downstairs desk drawer.\" \nIf you forget, just say: \"OK Google, where are my keys?\" Your all-knowing assistant will let you know they're in the downstairs desk drawer and just like that, you can get on with your morning. \nTrackR has a skill for Alexa that helps with another common nuisance, allowing you to ring your missing phone — even if it's on silent. Amazon's Alexa can pull up a seven-minute workout to brighten your morning muscles.

Instead, link your accounts to your smart assistant and order your ride with your voice. \nGet a Laugh \nYour first laugh of the day could very well come from your smart assistant. Ask Alexa or Google Home to tell you a joke. We're not saying they're on the same level as Amy Schumer, but they're at least good. A (very cheesy) laugh to get you going.
