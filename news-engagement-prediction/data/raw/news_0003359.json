Print \nOver the last week, two big environment crises have been unfolding in different parts of India. \nIn Assam, as many as 26 Greater adjutant storks at last count – a globally endangered bird species – were found dead in a wetland just outside Guwahati. The deaths of these birds were first discovered over January 23 and 24 and the toll has been steadily rising since. \nThe mass deaths – a significant blow to the population of a species that is already dwindling – should have set alarm bells ringing across the country, but apart from some local biologists and forest staff swinging to action, the incident continues to be a local story. \nFor close to a decade now, Purnima Burman, a biologist from Aaranyak, an NGO in Guwahati working on environment conservation, has been mobilising village women to protect the adjutant storks in villages of Assam’s Kamrup district – one of the few areas where the species is still found. Burman said she has been fighting a losing battle since the incident occurred. While her team has been busy collecting carcasses and rescuing sick birds, the cause of the deaths are still unknown and news of more carcasses being discovered on the wetlands keeps coming in. \nThe birds were initially thought to have died after consuming something toxic from a municipal corporation at a dumping site in Deepor Beel, a wetland near Guwahati with a sanctuary housing the species. However, no traces of toxic were found in the birds’ bodies during preliminary investigations. A team of wildlife experts will now have to be roped in to carry out further investigations. The team, however, will need to include international experts and toxicologists from international NGOS. This is not to say that we do not have adequate experts in India – but such incidents need the involvement of people who have worked on similar crises around the world who will carry out round-the-clock investigations. Disaster down south \nThe second disaster took place in Chennai. On Saturday, two ships collided near the Kamrajar Port at Ennore, causing an oil spill. For the last three days, officials have been struggling to clear the oil and sludge off the shores (by Monday, it had even reached Chennai’s Marina Beach, about 25 km from the spot of the spill), but with no luck. The spill has left a thick layer of slick along the Chennai coastline and has polluted several beaches in the vicinity. It’s also affected the livelihood of thousands of fishermen in the area who have not been able to go out into the sea since the incident. \nThe area off the coast of Chennai is rich in biodiversity. According to the Zoological Survey of India, there are 500 species of fish and 270 species of mollusks, while many threatened species such as Olive ridley turtles and some kinds of sea snakes frequent these waters. \nThe oil spill will have long-term consequences on this bio-diversity – but has not received much media attention yet, apart from coverage in regional papers and sporadic reports in the national media. There is no information from the authorities on the extent of the oil spill, how much damage it may have caused already and whether it has been contained. Not enough said \nBoth the incidents should have at least featured prominently in the national newspapers, if not made the front page. You may ask, why bother with the national media? Sadly, it is only in the face of media pressure that officials swing into action and the requisite machinery is put in place to deal with a problem of such a scale. \nWe have seen the results of this in the past. \nFor instance, in 2005 , it was widely reported that no tigers had been spotted for months in the Sariska National Park in Alwar, Rajasthan. The government set up a task force to look into this, and the reserve was repopulated with some tigers. And in 2007-08, in the span of a few months, more than a 100 dead gharials (a crocodilian species) washed ashore in the Chambal river in Madhya Pradesh. Pressure from the media spurred the official machinery into action and experts were roped in from different parts of the world. \nSimilar attention could help make some headway into the cause of death of the adjutant storks, precious few of which exist today. It is believed that only about 1200 of storks are found worldwide, of which around 800 are in Assam alone. \nThe oil spill, on the other hand, has the makings of a catastrophe. Four days on, there is little information on the toll it has taken or to what extent the spill has been contained. We need assessments from scientists on the damage to marine life and the impact on the fishing community. \nYes, states are going to polls in February and the month started with the presentation of the Budget, but surely the nation needs to know about the environment catastrophes of our times and what needs to be done to tackle them. \nThe author is an environment journalist and author of the book Green Wars – Dispatches from a Vanishing World We welcome your comments at Making transportation more sustainable even with fuel-based automobiles Published Nov 28, 2016 · 04:42 pm. These innovations can reduce the pollution caused by vehicles. Image credit: Getty Images Print \nAccording to the WHO’s Ambient Air Pollution Database released in 2016, ten of the twenty most polluted cities in the world are in India, with Gwalior and Ahmedabad occupying the second and third positions. Pollution levels are usually expressed in the levels of particulate matter (PM) in the air. This refers to microscopic matter that is a mixture of smoke, metals, chemicals and dust suspended in the atmosphere that can affect human health. Particulate matter is easily inhaled, and can cause allergies and diseases such as asthma, lung cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Indian cities have some of the highest levels of PM10 (particles smaller than 10 micrometres in diameter) and PM2.5 particles (particles smaller than 2.5 micrometres in diameter). The finer the particulate matter, the deeper into your lungs it can penetrate causing more adverse effects. According to WHO, the safe limits for PM2.5 is 10 micrograms per cubic meter. \nEmissions resulting from transportation is regarded as one of the major contributors to pollution levels, especially particulate matter. A study conducted by the Centre for Ecological Sciences of the Indian Institute of Science estimated that the transport sector constitutes 32% of Delhi’s emissions. It makes up 43% of Chennai’s emissions, and around 17% of Mumbai’s emissions. \nControlling emissions is a major task for cities and auto companies. The Indian government, to this end, has set emission standards for automobiles called the Bharat Stage emission standard, which mirrors European standards. This emission standard was first instituted in 1991 and has been regularly updated to follow European developments with a time lag of about 5 years. Bharat Stage IV emission norms have been the standard in 2010 in 13 major cities. To tackle air pollution that has intensified since then, the Indian government announced that Bharat Stage V norms would be skipped completely, and Stage VI norms would be adopted directly in 2020. \nBut sustainability in transport requires not only finding techniques to reduce the emissions from public and private transport but also developing components that are environment friendly. Car and auto component manufacturers have begun optimising products to be gentler on the environment and require lesser resources to manufacture, operate and maintain. \nThere are two important aspects of reducing emissions. The first is designing vehicles to consume less fuel. The second is making the emissions cleaner by reducing the toxic elements. \nIn auto exteriors, the focus is on developing light-weight but strong composite materials to replace metal. A McKinsey study estimates that plastic and carbon fibre can reduce weight by about 20% and 50% respectively. A lighter body reduces the engine effort and results in better fuel economy. Additionally, fuel efficiency can be increased by reducing the need for air conditioning which puts additional load on the vehicle engine thereby increasing fuel consumption. Automotive coatings (paints) and sheets provide better insulation, keep the vehicle cool and reduce the use of air conditioning. \nMost emissions are the result of inefficient engines. Perhaps the most significant innovations in making automobiles and mass transport systems more eco-friendly are being done in the engine. Innovations include products like fuel additives, which improve engine performance, resist corrosion and reduce fuel consumption while offering a great driving experience, and catalytic converters that reduce toxic emissions by converting them to less harmful output such as carbon dioxide, Nitrogen and water. Some of these catalytic converters are now capable of eliminating over 90 percent of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides. \nAll of these are significant measures to bring the negative impacts of vehicular pollution under control. With over 2 million vehicles being produced in India in 2015 alone and the moving to BS VI emission standards, constant innovation is imperative. \nBeyond this, in commercial as well as passenger vehicles, companies are innovating with components and processes to enable higher resource efficiency. Long-lasting paint coatings, made of eco-friendly materials that need to be refreshed less often are being developed. Companies are also innovating with an integrated coating process that enables carmakers to cut out an entire step of coating without compromising the colour result or the properties of the coating, saving time, materials and energy. Efforts are being made to make the interiors more sustainable. Parts like the instrument panel, dashboard, door side panels, seats, and locks can all be created with material like polyurethane plastic that is not only comfortable, durable and safe but also easily recyclable. Manufacturers are increasingly adopting polyurethane plastic like BASF’s Elastollan® for these very reasons. \nFrom pioneering the development of catalytic converters in 1975 to innovating with integrated process technology for coatings, BASF has always been at the forefront of innovation when it comes to making transport solutions more sustainable. The company has already developed the technology to handle the move of emissions standards from BS IV to BS VI. \nFor the future, given the expected rise in the adoption of electric cars—an estimated 5~8 percent of car production is expected to be pure electric or plug-in electric vehicles by 2020—BASF is also developing materials that enable electric car batteries to last longer and achieve higher energy density, making electronic mobility more feasible.
