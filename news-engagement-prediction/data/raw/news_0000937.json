It counters some of the black propaganda of those who are opposed to the referendum.” \nFox’s upbeat claims about foreign trade deals will attract the most attention in Brussels, where there is growing irritation over his flouting of rules preventing EU member states from negotiating independently. \nFox conceded that the “legal position” meant Britain could not sign new trade deals while it was still a member of the EU, but said there was nothing to stop it holding substantial “scoping” discussions. \n“It would be against Britain’s national interests for us not to be discussing with partners what Britain’s trade arrangements might be in the future,” he said. \nHe also gave short shrift to arguments that any future free trade agreement (FTA) between the EU and Britain should continue to be overseen by the European court of justice. \n“All the [other] EU FTAs have dispute resolution mechanisms that lie outside the ECJ and I think that would be a good model going forward for a potential EU/UK FTA,” said Fox. \nThe uncompromising stance adopted by Fox before the committee is likely to continue to baffle many in Europe, who regard the UK’s assertions that it will maintain all the advantages of the single market and customs union without any obligations with bewilderment. \nWhen asked by committee members to read out evidence presented by his department that outlined tariffs of up to 30% if Britain fails to strike such a deal, Fox claimed he could not read the small print because he had not brought his reading glasses with him. \nInstead he told MPs he was certain Britain would be able to inherit all of the existing EU trade deals and World Trade Organisation tariff schedules with little or no new negotiation. “We are on course now for no turbulence and no vacuum,” he said. “It’s hardly a picture of splendid isolation.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T20:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T15:54:52.185+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
