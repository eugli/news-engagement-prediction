STEVEN TRASK/FAIRFAX \nThe property in Oolong, NSW, where three people died in a water tank. \nAndrew, 69, collapsed while cleaning the empty cement water tank with a motorised water pump. Wife Anne, 63, and brother Richard, 68, went to his assistance but also collapsed. \nREAD MORE: STEVEN TRASK/FAIRFAX \nThe farmer collapsed while working in the empty cement water tank. His wife and brother went to his assistance, but also collapsed. \nThey are believed to have been poisoned by carbon monoxide gas that built up in the tank as the water pump was used. \nHis wife is believed to have called neighbours before entering the tank, who then contacted emergency services. \nThe bodies of the three were found inside the tank. \nActing Superintendent Andrew Koutsoufis of Hume Local Area Command said the cause of death was being investigated. Ad Feedback \n\"There was a petrol pump being used to clean the tank and that may have been the cause of the build-up of fumes at the bottom of the water tank,\" he said. \n\"It appears that it was lowered into the tank and that's caused the gases to be at the bottom of the tank.\" \nHe said the teams called to the scene had to wait for gas levels to recede before retrieving the bodies. \nSuperintendent Koutsoufis said the \"close-knit town\" was \"hurting at the moment\" and the family who lost three relatives were devastated. \nNeighbours said the couple had farmed the property since the early 1980s at least and their contribution to the town of Gunning would be sorely missed. \nThey leave behind three adult children, living in Sydney, as well as a number of grandchildren. \nDeputy mayor and close family friend Kim Turner paid tribute to the couple. \n\"It's a massive loss for the community. They were great community people, and the loss is insurmountable, not only in Gunning, but throughout the region. \n\"I personally will miss both of them enormously.\" \n\"We are devastated. It is safe to say we are all in shock. They were lovely people,\" said one neighbour who did not wish to be named. \nPolice and other emergency services were called to the rural property, just off the Hume Highway, on February 16 about 6.20pm. \nEmergency services personnel retrieved the bodies from the tank near the front of the property just after 9pm. \nThe deaths are not being treated as suspicious. A brief will be prepared for the information of the coroner, as officers from the Hume Local Area Command have established a crime scene to be examined by forensic officers. - Canberra Times", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T09:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:11:28.723+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
