Perplexed by it, I had to lash out with my pen at Abdul Hadi Awang for talking nonsense, thinking that Malaysians are that stupid to buy his rhetoric. \nI can understand if the PAS president had awoken on the wrong side of the bed, but for him to now point the finger at former prime minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad is absolute rubbish, when the world over looks down upon Malaysia as a modern Islamic nation because of our long scandalous history. According to Trading Economics, ‘Corruption Rank in Malaysia averaged 42.45 from 1995 until 2016, reaching an all time high of 60 in 2011 and a record low of 23 in 1995'. http://www.tradingeconomics.com/malaysia/corruption-rank \nI am sure Hadi is not aware that we are right in the midst of one of the worst scandals that has hit world news for nearly two years, with our infamous 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) fiasco. \nAs non-Muslims ourselves, we also question the integrity of the Muslim leaders in this country, when major scandals involving the theft of billions of dollars could be exposed worldwide and are being investigated by authorities in some 10 countries around the world, yet no further investigation or action is taken against the culprits, despite the hopeful and initial urging for investigation by the Conference of Rulers more than a year ago. \nWhereas a so-called non-Muslim nation like Singapore has prosecuted several culprits - and the latest, we are hoping the news is true that Jho Low’s private jet has also been impounded by the Singapore authorities - we as a nation are still allowing the culprits to roam freely. \nHow can Hadi expect the people to respect him if he never even makes a squeak about 1MDB? Or spoken about it? \nHow would non-Muslims believe that this man is really after God’s heart to implement God’s law, when the money siphoned from 1MDB and splashed around overseas has brought us much suffering? \nBlaming former prime minister Dr Mahathir for “the weakening of Islamic political power” is politically immature for the Islamist party president. I am sure he was not born yesterday. \nIn the case of Bumiputra Malaysia Finance (BMF), at least the then-prime minister (when he was still with Umno) was not directly involved in the scandal, but in the 1MDB scandal, the US Department of Justice has identified us as a nation of kleptocrats. Although in the same document, Malaysian Official 1 is not identified, cabinet minister Abdul Rahman Dahlan has established him to be none other than Najib Abdul Razak. \nThe international investigators who were investigating 1MDB could not trace any Arab donor who had allegedly donated RM2.6 billion into private accounts of Najib himself. \nSo what Islamic political base is Hadi talking about? Back then in the 1980s, at least Malaysia was respected as a nation par excellence; today, we are seen as a nation of kleptocrats, moving towards becoming another failed nation.
