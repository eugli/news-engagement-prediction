He says she's threatened him with a knife. \nDarius puts a theory in his legal docs. He says Tammy -- a former Harlem Globetrotter -- is \"desperate for stardom\" and he's worried she'll neglect their daughter to achieve newfound fame. He also says she's super competitive with him and jealous of his fame. \nNow get this ... a judge granted Darius' request for a TRO and ordered Tammy to move out of the family house. But she also got a TRO which required him to pack his bags and leave.
