Photo: Christopher Pearce \nAndrew Mehrtens screamed to a halt on sixpence, right in the midst of brilliant move. What was going on? Within thirty seconds the word came back. There was a spy in the house! A nefarious, low-down, snooping, sneaky, SPY. This was a big story! ( Hello, SMH? Tell John to hold the front page, 'cos I think I've got me a big one! ) \nAnd then, of course – for, I know you are way ahead of me, dear reader – the penny dropped. The spy in question, of course, was your humble correspondent. Laurie Mains had taken one look at me, and knew that my brilliant rugby brain would instantly analyse the All Blacks training session, work out the strengths and weaknesses, the moves they were preparing, the final passer on their B-52-double-cut-out-and-how's-your-mother? call. And all the rest. Advertisement \nAnd he also knew that this had no sooner happened than I would have been straight on to the blower to Bob Dwyer to unload my breathtaking info and insights, and the Wallabies would go on to win the match because of it. \nLook, I've been thrown out of better joints, but rarely have I been so chuffed – if gobsmacked – to be quickly escorted from the premises, so they could get back to training. Laurie Mains remains the only person, ever , who seemed to have respect for my rugby brain! \nThat aside? The sheer ludicrousness of it, you mean? Yes, well. Even back then, in the days before the internet, the idea that one person observing a training could have meaningful input in predicting the way a team would play – at a time when every game they played was freely available on video anyway – was absurd. \nAnd nothing has changed! It has only become more absurd. \nWhich brings us, of course, to Tuesday's stunning news . It seems Michael Cheika wasn't behind the All Black bugging scandal of August last year, hadn't placed a listening device in their team room at the Double Bay InterContinental. Bill Pulver wasn't hiding behind a pot-plant after all! Stephen Moore's bow-tie wasn't really a camera! \nFar from it being anyone in the Australian camp, as was darkly insinuated in the Kiwi rugby community, the true culprit – it is alleged, but it will be for the courts to decide – appears likely to be someone within their own outfit! The very head of their own security team! The same bloke who's been looking after the All Blacks security for the last TEN YEARS! \nTold yers, you Kiwis! As your humble correspondent said at the time – in an admittedly rare example of getting it right from the opening ball of the first over – the idea that anyone in the Wallabies was responsible was always nonsense from the beginning. What on earth could All Blacks coach Steve Hansen say that Cheika would seize on and use to his advantage? \n\"Israel! Hoops! Over here. I've gone through the tapes. Hansen says he wants the All Blacks to go out hard on Saturday, smash us in the first five minutes, and grind us down in the set-piece. He says they're going to use the \"B9,\" the \"Stray Sausage\" and the \"Loser Andy\" moves. So what I want you to do is ...\" \nPlease. \nIt was a nonsense from the beginning, and is now demonstrated to be so. \nThe upshot? \nI think you Kiwis owe us an apology. No, not just for thumping us in the Bledisloe for the last 75 freaking years! (But, that too, if you want to.) \nAnd not just for pretending that Phar Lap was actually one of yours. (The point is, like so many, Phar Lap only came good when he got to Oz!) \nYou need to apologise for all those slurs against our good name, the insults about how the Wallabies had been caught CHEATING! \nAnd yes, I know what you are saying. (Which is also rare, as I remain amazed that you can say words like \"falafel\" without using a singular vowel, and most of your words sound like Buck Shelford trod on them first.) You're saying that as the person accused is, after all, an Australian, you were still right that the Aussies were up to no good. \nNuh. That doesn't work. In this instance that is completely irrelevant. In this context of a Bledisloe – when two tribes go to war, meeting in the flatlands by the water every year to sort this out – the alleged person in question was not one of our tribe, but one of your tribe. Not just that, but the head of your own security operation! \nYou need to apologise. \nGo on, we're waiting and ... \nAnd what? \nYou won't apologise for those insults, until we apologise for the underarm bowling episode? \nOk, we're sorry.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T08:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T03:15:48.974+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
