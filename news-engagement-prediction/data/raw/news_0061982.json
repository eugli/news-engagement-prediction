Source: News Limited \nThe break away from the game, to spend time with family, seemed to be working wonders for Davey Warner, who was mixing brick wall defence with electric feet to gain access to his trademark aggression. \nAt 0 for 80 with 15 minutes left until lunch, it is believed the Cricket Australia scheduling team was organising a Sydney based ticker tape parade for masterminding the right mix of white ball cricket in preparation for what they were celebrating as a clean sweep of the Indians on their home patch. \nAnd then Giardia Lamblia happened. \nThis is not a character off ‘Happy Days’, nor does it have any involvement in the lyrics for Ritchie Valens’ hit ‘La Bamba’. \nGiardia is a parasite that wants to raise its family in your bowel. It is an unwanted cretin who refuses to pay rent and will cause you sleepless nights and pain in your abdomen as it takes the kids up stream to that enormous fiesta of mulched sausages and fizzy cordial. \nHelpful titbit on Giardia: you can actually have it without showing any symptoms. Use this to your advantage as a medical condition with your current, or new, employer. Why? There is no easier money than watching the NBA box scores tick over during four 15 minute visits to a cleansing station each day. No questions will be asked of your lingering Giardia Lamblia. \nAnd while Matt Renshaw prepared for this series better than anyone – I say this due to his lack of involvement in the BBL and recent one day series – you just can’t prepare for this filthy little bug and the impact it will have on your body. Matt Renshaw retired ill in curious circumstances on day one against India. Source: AFP \nUnless of course you are willing to fly direct to Delhi, eat a subway sandwich, then head home minus 11 of your kilos, needing to be quarantined in Melbourne, causing much angst for the passengers on your flight, as this process requires a doctor’s clearance before anyone can disembark, adding fifty minutes on the tarmac to a 13 hour flight direct from Dubai making yourself a target for both death stares and threats. \nThe silver lining is that you won’t find a more efficient weight loss program. Seriously, scrap the rock monster paleo diet. Just fly to Delhi and drink the tap water. You are guaranteed to lose eleven kegs in 10 days. \nWe all know the feeling and we can all appreciate the pain young Renshaw was experiencing when he had to dart from the field at the fall of Warner’s wicket in the hope of alleviating the pressure of getting that first squirt out of the way, allowing yourself at least 30 minutes before the onslaught of pressure builds to sweat-worthy levels. \nTo those that threw stones at Renshaw for retiring ill, this is not ‘Nam. Napalm is not being dropped on us as we fight for ground control. You can actually request a halt in proceedings to relieve yourself of having to spray your faecal matter into your white cricket pants or next to the umpire at square leg. \nWhile it’s great to come across as grumpy and commanding of respect because folklore suggests we nearly killed a man on a 40 degree day, who was suffering from extreme dehydration and battling this ugly little bug so badly that he was throwing up nothing but bile and supposedly soiling himself to the point where he lost eight kilos in a day; the modern day requires the need to lighten up. \nLeave folklore in the ‘80s because poo waits for no one. Saha takes absolute screamer 0:43 \nAt the completion of day one, the Australians can hold their heads high. It was an even day’s play thanks to the 50-run last wicket partnership between Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazelwood, of which the No.11 contributed one run. The last wicket stand, and the freedom displayed by Starc, was a statement that the spinning wickets can be countered, but it will take some extreme bravery to put enough runs on the board for our bowlers to defend. \nInterestingly, Starc’s Test batting average of 24 is higher than that of Mitchell Marsh, 23. Yeah, it is only one run, but if Australia is going to have any chance this series, the No.6 can’t average less than the No.8. View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
