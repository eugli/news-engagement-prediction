But these therapies affect only the patient.\nThe concern is over use of the technology in human reproductive cells or early embryos because the changes would be passed along to offspring.\nResearch using the powerful technique is plowing ahead even as researchers from the University of California and the Broad Institute battle for control over the CRISPR patent.\nAlthough gene editing of human reproductive cells to correct inherited diseases \"must be approached with caution, caution does not mean prohibition,\" the committee said in a statement.\nSarah Norcross of the Progress Educational Trust, which advocates for people affected by genetic conditions, called the recommendations \"sensible and prudent.\"\nBut Marcy Darnovsky of the Center for Genetics and Society said they were \"unsettling and disappointing,\" arguing that they \"constitute a green light for proceeding with efforts to modify the human germline\" - changes that can be passed to future generations.\n(Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen; Editing by Marguerita Choy and Andrew Hay)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T01:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:23:05.613+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
