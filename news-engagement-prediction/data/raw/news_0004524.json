Eadie ’s book Embraced By the Light , which tells the story of one woman’s near-death experience — a likely mental association driven by Kim’s traumatic run-in with armed robbers last year at Paris Fashion Week . On Wednesday night (Feb. 1, 2017), Kim made her relationship with the book to the next level by making it the first official reading selection in her newly minted book club. So guys….. @chrissyteigen & @jenatkinhair & I are starting a book club! \n— Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) February 2, 2017 I'm making them read \"Embraced By The Light\" as our first book!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T04:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:46:32.265+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
