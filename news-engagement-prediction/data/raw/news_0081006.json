According to E! , the actor quietly wed Domino Kirke (sister of Girls actress Jemima Kirke) on Monday, February 27, in a courthouse ceremony in—where else?—Brooklyn, New York.\nAccording to photos from the nuptials, the bride chose a white lace dress with three-quarter-length sleeves, while her new husband opted for a dapper navy suit.\nA few friends and family, including Jemima and the bride&apos;s other sister, Lola, were at the ceremony and took to social media to share their well wishes for the newlyweds. (No word on whether Jenny Humphrey a.k.a. Taylor Momsen or any of the other Gossip Girl staples such as Leighton Meester, Blake Lively, or Ed Westwick attended.) Lola posted a sweet photo to Instagram of the three sisters and Domino&apos;s son, Cassius. She captioned the shot with an especially heartfelt message to her sister: \"When someone gets married in a courthouse, it&apos;s really an open invitation to everyone but the beautiful bride to explore all that fashion has to offer. Here, I try a look simply called &apos;Pants,&apos; as Cassius goes for &apos;That Dude from #incubus&apos; and Jemima experiments with &apos;Off to Therapy!&apos; Congratulations @dominokirke. We love you.\"\nLoading View on Instagram\nAnd another friend shared a photo of the happy couple together, with the sentiment \"Congrats to a couple beautiful people.\"\nLoading View on Instagram\nCongratulations to Penn Badgley and Domino Kirke! And, as they say, XOXO.\nRELATED: 10 Times the Gossip Girl Pilot Revealed Dan Was Gossip Girl", "external_links": ["https://www.instagram.com/p/BRBrIeJD6sD/", "http://www.eonline.com/news/832493/surprise-penn-badgley-is-a-married-man", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BRBaEzBgsSj/"], "published": "2017-02-28T05:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:11:58.362+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
