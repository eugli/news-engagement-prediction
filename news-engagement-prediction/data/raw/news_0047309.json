Fool us once... The 3D-render in particular seems more like a fan-made concept. \nStill, the price of CNY 3,188 (around $460) seems about right as the Nokia 6 goes for CNY 2,300 or so. Currently, the JD page shows only the most basic specifications - an Android phone with a metal frame and LTE connectivity. Nokia 8 image by JD.com \nSome hard to verify rumors point to a 5.7 Super AMOLED screen (QHD resolution), 24MP main camera with OIS and a 12MP selfie shooter, a high-end Snapdragon chipset and plenty of storage. \nNokia will bring the 3 and 5 to the MWC , so it may be too early to have specifics on the flagship model, let alone put it in online stores.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:10:50.601+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
