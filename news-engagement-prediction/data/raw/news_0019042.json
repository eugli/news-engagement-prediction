Many things, actually. \nSure, the number suggest Williams is one of the SEC’s best shot blockers. But you’d never guess that by just looking at him. \nIn a game full of tall trees in the perimeter, Williams stands just 6-foot-5. He has a 6-foot, 10.5-wing span, but he’s so thick that you hardly notice the limbs. He’s not a condor like Vols sophomore forward Kyle Alexander or former Vols star Jordan McRae . He’s not someone who looks like he can grab a quarter off the top of the backboard. \nThen there’s the fact that Williams so often has a goofy, childlike grin — something he tries hard but often fails to conceal on the court and never even tries to hide off the court. \nPerhaps that’s why taller opponents keep acting so surprised when Williams rises either from the back side or directly in front of them and swats their shots. \nAfter a three-game stretch without a single block — a career-first for Williams — the freshman re-emerged as a rim protector when Tennessee needed it Wednesday night, getting three of his four blocked shots in the final 81 seconds of the Vols’ thrilling, come-from-behind, 75-66 win over the shellshocked Rebels.

Even the college programs who didn’t love Williams the prospect as an athlete loved Williams the prospect as an instinctual player, and those instincts are impossible to ignore. \n(Buy one month of GoVols247 VIP access and GET TWO MONTHS FREE .) \nSure, there are times Williams commits fouls that make Barnes want to bang his head into the scorer’s table. \nThat playmaking instinct — combined with his ability to understand a scouting report and the strengths and weaknesses of his opponents — is what makes him so effective in the paint, though. \nIf it looked like Ole Miss was running some of the same stuff over and over down the stretch, it’s because that’s exactly what the Rebels were doing. And who could blame them? For much of the night, that five-spread ball-screen attack was working really well. And when the Rebels went into a funk down the stretch, they tried going back to the well. They tried to get Williams in bad matchups and force him to do what he often does: foul. \nWilliams didn’t blame them for that. In fact, he said he probably would have done the same thing. (Photo: Tennessee athletics, UTSports.com) \n“The fact is we weren’t doing well with it the whole game, so they went to it every possession the last two minutes,” the freshman said. “I think they went on a scoring drought, and they needed a score, so they just kept going back to that five-spread ball screen in the middle of the paint, and they tried to attack me with a big and then try to pop ( Sebastian Saiz ). \n“It’s a hard thing to guard, but you just have to adjust and know your coverages and basically just play hard. There’s not much to it. If you play with some energy, the point guard goes back to the front and you can get back to your man.” \nWilliams said he tries to learn scouting reports “inside and out” so he can get that thinking out of the way and then play as fast as possible during games. \n“It’s just playing with energy,” he said. “It’s difficult if you think about it, ‘cause you’re back-pedaling, you’re trying to not bump ‘em while they’re driving. There’s a lot going on, but it’s just all about knowing the rules and regulations of how the refs are gonna call it and when they won’t. \n“Really it’s just staying vertical and trying to time it up and just block that shot.” \nAnd that’s exactly what Williams did the final 81 seconds, when he blocked three shots and also forced a turnover Deandre Burnett when the Rebels junior point guard got him in a one-on-one matchup and tried taking it to the rim. \nOle Miss coach Andy Kennedy ’s players might have been surprised by Williams, but Kennedy said he wasn’t. \n“He’s just so active,” Kennedy said. “I think he’s always around the ball. He uses his body well. We have the size advantage for the most part when we had Sebastian (Saiz) on him, but when you play behind him he negates that because he puts his body on your body and negates any size advantage you might have. \n“I thought he was big with those blocked shots. He’s a terrific player.” \n\nContact Wes Rucker by email at wesrucker247@gmail.com or ON TWITTER , or FOLLOW GOVOLS247 ON FACEBOOK .
