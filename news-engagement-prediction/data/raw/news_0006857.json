And most of the cutest little critters in the American zoo Twitter battle are in fact from our Motherland. \nWhere we live, we don't have to share photos of animals in zoos. We have our South African National Parks, we have the best free-roaming farms, the best rehabilitation and conservation centres, we have the Big 5 and the Little 5 and everything in between. \nWe are, essentially, the best place in the WORLD to have a #CuteAnimalTweetOff. \nIf you agree, take a look at some of these incredibly adorable #CuteAnimalTweetOff photos shared from our friends in wild places, and remember to share some of your own #CuteAnimalTweetOff photos for us to include. You can us or share your photo on social media on our Twitter , Facebook or Instagram accounts. \nHere are some of the American #CuteAnimalTweetOff favourites... Now check out SA's beauts... \nThis baby ellie is just trying to find its feet...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T18:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:27:16.282+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
