Article continues below \nAnd while things did not start as well as he would have ideally liked, the 23-year-old has since settled back into life in England and has been at the heart of United's current 16-game unbeaten run that has seen them come within touching distance of second place. \nHe has seven goals in all competitions this season, but his overall impact on the game has been noticeable to the fans that watch him weekly. Still, it's hard not to think what he could or should be doing if he is worth ¬£89.3 million. Article continues below Former Barcelona chief reveals the one big problem Ibrahimovic and Messi had \nInstead of getting extra time in at the training ground to work on his game and justify his price tag, Pogba spends his spare time simply having fun. \nHe seems to have a handshake for just about everyone, and he even has special dances with teammate Jesse Lingard. Well, now you can add his mum to that list. \nPogba posted a video of a special handshake that he and his mum share with the caption: \"Best handshake everüòÇüî• ‚ù§ #pp #neverfollow #pogfamily\" \nHe loves an emoji that man. \nIn today's world, there is nothing on social media that is universally well received - it just does not happen. \nAs you can see by some of the excerpts below, plenty of football fans jumped on Pogba's Instagram post to comment on Pogba's priorities, amongst other things. \nIs Pogba not allowed a life? Apparently not according to some of these trolls. There was plenty of appreciation for the warm relationship he shares with his mum, but it seems no post can go without some idiotic trolling. \nThe next time Pogba will take to the pitch will be this Thursday night against his brother Florentin as United battle Saint Etienne in the last 16 of the Europa League. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
