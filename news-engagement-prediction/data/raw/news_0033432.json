For Valida , she wanted to change this stereotype up, and show the world a different kind of love story—one between a human and a rescue dog. \n\"This took me a while, because I wanted it to be about animals, because yes, I am a crazy animal person,\" Valida told AXS. \nValida, who is now based in Los Angeles but originally from Bosnia, has a deep love for animals—especially rescue animals. This song is to provide awareness about what happens to stray dogs by the government in Eastern Europe. A lot of the times, dogs will be euthanized since there is no home for them, and that is something Valida just cannot stand for. This electro-pop love song doesn't seem like it would be based around stray dogs, but the video concept works, and it's something that is not seen in the electronic world very often, if at all. \nShe decided to make her music video for her single \"Stars\" about this issue, and she hopes that enough will see this to stop help stray dogs not only in Europe, but everywhere in the world. Watch the exclusive premiere for \"Stars\" below.
