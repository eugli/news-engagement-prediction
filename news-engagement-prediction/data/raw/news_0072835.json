A pre-birthday bash has already taken place. \nKaran will next be seen in '3 Dev', which is the story of a couple, where the wife is extremely religious and the husband is not. They rent out their house to three youngsters and certain situations lead to the trio being termed as 'God', leading to hilarious situations of lies, mistaken identity and chaos. The film also stars Tisca Chopra, Kay Kay Menon, Kunal Roy Kapur and TV actor Ravi Dubey, who marks his big screen debut with the film.\nCurrently Bipasha, who tied the knot with Karan in April 2016, has no movie in her kitty.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T09:30:27.547+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
