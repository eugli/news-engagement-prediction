Photo: Gustavo Caballero/Getty Images for Invictus Games Do not promise Morgan Freeman to Uzbekistan if you do not intend to follow through, damn it! A film from the country, Daydi (it translates to Rogue ), was set for release this week, but the Uzbekistan film-licensing agency pulled it for failing to star Morgan Freeman as promised. According to The Independent , Freeman was featured prominently in the trailer and poster for the film, but his likeness was reportedly ripped from his role in 2015’s Last Knights . Freeman’s absence in Daydi despite the advertising is thus being called a breach of consumer’s rights by the licensing agency. Two government bodies will ultimate decide if Daydi can debut. Trying to dupe your audience with the almighty himself?
