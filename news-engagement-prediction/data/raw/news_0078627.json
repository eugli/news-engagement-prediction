Key points: 56 culling permits issued over past year Farmer says culling is the only option Wombat numbers are stable, says UTAS \nSarcoptic mange has killed almost all wombats in the Narawntapu National Park in northern Tasmania, the area worst affected by the disease which is caused by mites burrowing under an animal's skin. \nThere are fears of a localised extinction of the species in that area and research is underway to understand where the mange came from and why the wombats are so badly affected. \nWhile some diseased wombats are shot when they are beyond help, healthy wombats are being legally killed for wreaking havoc on farming properties. \nIn 2016, the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industry, Parks, Water and the Environment issued 56 permits to cull wombats. \nA department spokesman said while landholders were encouraged to adopt non-lethal approaches to managing impacts of wombats, it was not always possible. \n\"Applications for a permit to take a native species, for crop protection purposes, are assessed on a case by case basis,\" the spokesman said. \n\"Permits will have conditions on them, including an identified number of animals that are authorised to be taken and within an identified time frame. \nHe said the department reviewed wombat numbers annually to influence permit numbers, ensuring the species' conservation was not impacted. \n\"Based on the most recent trends from statewide spotlight data, there is no indication that statewide wombat numbers are seeing ongoing declines in overall population,\" he said.

(Supplied: Kellie Simpson) Extinction can be swift, sanctuary warns \nThe ABC spoke to a deer farmer in southern Tasmania who was recently granted a permit to shoot 50 wombats over a 12-month period. \nHe said culling was his only option after the animals had burrowed under his wallaby-proof fencing, which cost him hundreds of thousands of dollars, allowing his deer to escape. \nBonorong Wildlife Sanctuary owner Greg Irons said the impact of mange on localised wombat populations should serve as a warning about the fragility of the species. \n\"If we look at Narawntapu National Park and the devastation that mange has had on populations there, I would hope that that is also being taken into account,\" he said. \n\"If that [the spread of mange] can happen so quickly, maybe we need to make sure we are keeping our wombat numbers very high in case we have something crop up that can wipe them out quickly.\" \nMr Irons said Tasmania's ecosystem was unique and required extra care. \n\"We only have to look at the Tasmanian tiger as an example of how horribly wrong we've made mistakes in the past,\" he said. 'Bulldozers of the bush' \nTasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association President Wayne Johnston said culling was a last resort. \n\"They are called the bulldozer of the bush,\" he said. \n\"They cause damage in large numbers, they create large burrows in the middle of paddocks and they destroy wallaby fencing.\" \nMr Johnston said the permits were not easy to acquire. \n\"You have got to have an on-site visit and the damage has to be shown to a wildlife management officer,\" he said. \n\"It's not something you can just order over the phone. \n\"This is a last resort for our farmers; it's not something that farmers like to do at all. It's just something that unfortunately we have to do.\" \nUniversity of Tasmania wildlife ecology lecturer Scott Carver said the statewide wombat population was healthy. \n\"Since the mid-1980s wombat populations appear to have increased a little bit and then plateaued off in more recent years to a stable number,\" he said. \n\"Wombats are really affected by three main things: conflict with landowners, collision with motor vehicles and disease. \n\"We have to monitor their populations really carefully.\" \nThe State Government and the University of Tasmania have formed a wombat working group to try to understand these threats.
