Also to try and put a bit of pressure on the others. But normal. A normal strategy. I like to respect every decision for the other coaches.\" \nRecalling Chelsea’s 3-0 defeat at Arsenal that has proved to be a turning point in his team’s season, Conte added: “Now we are top of the League and, in that moment, I remember that we were eight points from City. Chelsea face Arsenal at Stamford Bridge on Saturday \n“To answer Pep, the situation can change very quickly. I think, in that moment, City had eight points more than Chelsea. After 18 games, the situation had changed. There are 15 games left and we must pay great attention, to reply to Pep. You understand? \n“It's important to keep the antennae very high. Very important. I have a bit of experience in this type of situation as a footballer and a manager, and I want to keep our concentration very high – me, the players, the club, the fans – because we must know a lot of great teams are behind us and anything can still happen, above all if we are not at our best concentration.” \nC onte did, however, hint that Arsenal may be out of the title race if they lose at Stamford Bridge and fall 12 points behind Chelsea. “If, if we win the game, for sure, it's a good hit for us,” said the Italian. Arsenals Saturday lunchtime horror shows \n“To improve your own place in the table, take three points and also to have Arsenal 12 points (away), that's very good. \n“But tomorrow, I'm sure, it will be a really tough game and we must pay great attention. Arsenal beat us already in the first game, and they have the possibility to repeat this in this game. \n“For this reason, we must be focused, stay in great concentration, and have the same anger, the same will to fight and try to win. It's important. I like to repeat to my players - look at yourselves, not at others.” Follow Telegraph Football", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T16:41:49.389+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
