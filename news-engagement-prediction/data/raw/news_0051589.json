(Getty Images/iStockphoto) \nStudents often feel mathematics is one of the toughest hurdles during examinations and worry unnecessarily about the paper when they should know that all it takes is a simple, effective preparation strategy to score good marks. \nThe Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has released the Class 12 Board exam date sheet for 2017 and mathematics is scheduled for March 20. The plan for the remaining days must focus on the following five most important points. \nPre-exam planning \n1.Each lesson has to be revised over two days. \n2.Go through each topic thoroughly and include all examples and exercises from the NCERT book and NCERT Exemplar. \n3.Revise the subject keeping the weightage and the pattern in mind. The approach is explained below with the example of one chapter: \nChapter : Matrices and determinants ; Weightage : 13 marks. Distribution of marks : 6+4+2+1 - to be the expected pattern. \nCreate five sets of papers of the said weightage and answer each set in 20 minutes (1.5 minutes per 1 mark). The same approach is to be followed for all chapters as per their weightage and pattern. The time taken should be proportionate to 1.5 minute per 1 mark. This practice will help you balance both content and time management. \n4.Write one full syllabus test every week and get it checked by your teachers. You should complete these test papers in 2 Â½ hrs (instead of the actual three hours). If possible, do this test between 10.30 am and 1 pm. \n5.Avoid these errors: \n(a)Numerical calculation \n(b)Forgetting to add + C in indefinite integral questions \n(c)Forgetting to write the equations of the line(3-D) in standard form before starting any further calculation.
