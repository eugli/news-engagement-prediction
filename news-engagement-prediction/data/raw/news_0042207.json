Close 21-year-old charged after being 'taken down' by tradies UP NEXT \nThe 21-year-old Murrarie man remains behind bars while the people who took him down are getting a bit of attention. \nTheir citizen’s arrest has now been watched by thousands online. \nIn a move straight from the footy field, one brave bystander went to tackle the thief but she hit too low. \nThe young thief sidestepped another tradie and also narrowly escaped the arms of another. Tradies put in a heroic effort to try to stop the man, but he initially proved too quick on his feet. Photo: 7 News \nBut they did not give up their chase. \nIn the end it was a team effort to bring the accused down and help was not far behind. \nIt was one woman’s attempted takedown that impressed the tradies watching from the sidelines though. The rampage left a trail of destruction across Brisbane. Photo: Supplied \n“Yeah, I reckon she’s cool. She deserves a medal for having a crack,” witness Matty Newman said. \nIt is alleged the man had earlier led police on a wild ride through Brisbane. \nHe dodged traffic and swiped cars stopped at lights before crashing at Woolloongabba and running. Numerous stunned witnesses captured the aftermath in photos and videos. Photo: Supplied \nThe driver, Robert John Hopkins, has been charged with a string of offences including dangerous operation of a vehicle and burglary. \nHe made a brief appearance in court on Thursday and did not apply for bail. Eventually, Hopkins discovered it was just as difficult to evade the long arms of Brisbane's tradies as it was the state's law enforcement. Photo: 7 News \nHopkins will stay behind bars until his case returns to court next month, but for the team that helped put him there, it is back to work as normal.
