Hebron senior guard Shane Devine talks about the Vikings come-from-behind, 57-55, win over Westminster on Monday, Jan. 30 in Ellicott City. Devine provided the game-winning steal in the final seconds to seal the victory. \nNow Satori, Imani, Kalani, Lyric and Jaelyn are trying to restart the same winning tradition. \n“They will probably surpass their mothers,” Waters predicted. “Their mothers may not want to hear that, but they probably will and the reason why I say that is because they have their parents there to spend that time with them — provide them with the direction and the opportunities that weren’t necessarily afforded to them. I think this era is pretty unique. These girls are just so much more advanced than kids have been in the past. I think we are pretty strong now. I think we are up and coming.” \nSatori has averaged about nine points on 41 percent shooting from the field, three assists and three steals per game as a starter in the Vikings backcourt this season. And like Kacy, brings lock-down defense to her team. (Monica D'Ippolito) \n“I don’t slap the floor like she did, but I always try to shut anyone down if I can on defense,” Satori said. “People always come up to me and ask me, ‘Do you know how good your mom was?’ I don’t really know so much, but I’m trying to get a swing of it so I can emulate her game.” \nFor Kacy, it wasn’t after a big win, but a lopsided loss that made her realize she wanted a future in basketball. \nIn her first year competing in AAU Nationals at the end of ninth grade, she played a team that featured several players who ended up playing at the University of Connecticut, which has won a NCAA record 11 national titles. Kacy’s team lost by 30 points that day, but the defeat changed her commitment to basketball. \n“That’s when I realized I needed to get better, because there were so many great players out there,” she said. “It was when I was humbled that I realized that I love this sport.” \nKacy went on to break records in high school and college. In 1994, she was named Baltimore Sun Athlete of the Year as a senior at Hammond. She scored more than 1,000 points and stands as the Golden Bears’ all-time assist leader (396). She later played 111 consecutive games as a four-year starter for Georgetown University , where she broke the program’s assist record in 1998, and held the all-time record (436) until 2002. \n“Most proud of assists, I love getting my teammates shots. I can remember in college the assistant coach handed me the basketball with the assist record at Georgetown. It was her record. I was so humbled because I looked up to her so much,” Kacy said. “[But] definitely my favorite part is being a mom for sure. That is the best. My kids are so receptive to me. They just have support and that’s what my parents have been for me for years and years and years. I never felt judged or demeaned by my parents. That is the least I could do. Kids don’t ask to be born, so the least I could do as their mom is to cherish them and love them. That is pretty much the highlight of my day is being a mom.” \nKacy coaches Satori on their AAU team, the Lady Blazers, alongside Karyn and Rhonda, whose daughters are also on the roster. \n“We had a lot of people make varsity this year and it’s just a wonderful experience to go out and support each other when we can,” Satori said. “It’s been great. She knows me, so that’s even more beneficial for me. There is no easy way out, obviously. She still treats me like anyone else, but it’s like I have a mother and a basketball coach and mentor all in one.” \nLike Satori, Kalani is a freshman trying to help elevate her varsity team. She entered the Wilde Lake girls basketball program similar to how Rhonda stepped on to the Wildecats her freshman year. \n“Once I started at Wilde Lake, we were in a rebuilding year. The team had been terrible,” Rhonda said. “We ended up getting a new coach, just like Wilde Lake has this year and we started to rebuild. I would like to say that I brought some new life in to Wilde Lake girls basketball, but we got more interest throughout the school and each year we got more players in that were going to help us.” \nRhonda was named co-Player of the Year after her senior year of high school. She left the Wildecats’ program having scored 1,127 career points to go with 938 rebounds before moving on to Temple , where she ranks on the Owls’ all-time lists in scoring (989 points), rebounds (896) and steals (212). She later played professionally for 12 years in Australia, Brazil and Germany. \n“Her defensive tenacity and her drive, that’s what I [want] from her game and I am working on getting from her game,” Kalani said. “She’s injured now, but watching her hop around on her injured foot, still rebounding, still getting after us when we’re at our workouts, just still going at it. I can be doing more of that. I can be getting on the floor. I can be getting after every rebound, getting after every steal.” \nWhile competing overseas she met her husband Michael, who also played professional basketball for a number of years. After having Kalani, Rhonda decided to end her professional career and moved back to Columbia. \n“The player is always going to be in there. It is never going to leave,” Rhonda said. “But becoming a mom was awesome and I knew it was time for me to kind of concentrate on Kalani at that point. She is definitely her father’s daughter. Michael is a very good 3-point shooter and Kalani has taken that on and I think she has more range than he does. It is such a pretty shot. I love it. Defensively she’s coming along, we’re trying to get her to dive on the floor a little bit more and be a little bit more aggressive inside, which is my game. I was a defensive player.” \nAfter just one victory a season ago, Wilde Lake has won three games this winter. Kalani, who is averaging 8.3 points, 6.2 rebounds and 2.3 assists per game, says she hopes she can turn around the program like her mom did many years ago. \n“Rebuilding the program [is] probably more difficult than I thought it was going to be,” she said. “It definitely takes a mentally tough perspective. [Staying] positive is something that we have to do and continue to do to finish out this season. [We just have to] keep working on our own game, keep working with the team and building strong relationships.” \nKaryn was also an integral part of the same Wilde Lake team that Rhonda began rebuilding in the early 80’s. Karyn had never played organized basketball before, but fell in love with the game after trying out for JV her freshman year. By her senior season, she was an all-county selection, and later walked on to the team at UMBC. She earned a scholarship her sophomore year and graduated as one of the Retrievers’ all-time leaders in scoring, steals and assists. \n“I didn’t think I was capable of playing [Division-I basketball] because I started so late,” Karyn said. “I wasn’t recruited. I didn’t know anything about the recruiting scene. My high school coach wasn’t involved in that with me, so I walked on at UMBC. I made the team and my last three years I earned a scholarship. So it wasn’t until I walked on and made the team — that the bells kind of went off, like ‘oh I guess I’m kind of good.’” \nHer knack for basketball carried over to her twins, Lyric and Jaelyn. The duo has helped elevate Long Reach toward the top of the county standings the past two seasons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T14:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T11:11:26.992+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
