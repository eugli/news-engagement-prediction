And it would restrict the freedom of the independent judiciary to choose the most appropriate sentence for each offender.”\nThe justice secretary will set out figures which show there has been a 140 per cent increase in sex offenders being sent to prison and a 50 per cent increase in the length of sentences for sex crimes over the last 15 years.\nThere has also been a 75 per cent increase in custodial sentences for violent offenders.\nLiz Truss will also call for better mental health care for repeat offenders on community sentences Credit: Eddie Mulholland for The Telegraph S he will also warn that in today’s prisons three out of every five offenders is in jail for crimes of sex, drug pushing or violent crime.\nThe speech marks a change in tone from her predecessor Michael Gove, who called for prison numbers to be reduced when he was justice secretary .\nSpeaking in November last year Mr Gove also called for the release of 500 prisoners serving imprisonment for public protection (IPP) sentences.\nIn a speech in London Ms Truss will also call for better mental health care for repeat offenders on community sentences, promising extra funding to try and break the cycle for those who commit non-violent crime like shoplifting and theft.\nMichael Gove called for prisoner numbers to be reduced as Justice Secretary Credit: PA M s Truss will say today: \"There can never be an excuse for committing crime but too often people end up in prison because our interventions to tackle problems like drug addiction or mental health issues don’t work as well as they should.\n\"Early intervention is not a ‘nice to have’ added extra to the justice system, it is vital if we are ever to break the cycle of crime, punishment and more crime.”\nAnd on more serious crimes she will say: \"Shadow Attorney General Shami Chakrabarti wants to halve our prison numbers because she does not believe “the sum of human wickedness” could have doubled in her lifetime.\n“She blames a political arms race for the numbers in our jails.\nShami Chakrabarti and Jeremy Corbyn Credit: PA “What has actually happened in Baroness Chakrabarti’s lifetime is that the criminal justice system has got better at catching and convicting criminals who have perpetrated some of the most appalling crimes imaginable. \n\"And sentence lengths now better reflect the severity of crimes like domestic violence, rape and child abuse.\n\"It’s not that the sum of human wickedness has doubled – it’s that we have driven that wickedness out from the shadows and put it where it belongs, behind bars.”\nI t came as a BBC investigation into HMP Northumberland unveiled shocking drug use and poor discipline. \nIn one scene a senior prison officer can be seen shaking and having a fit on the ground after inadvertently inhaling the drug spice, which was being smoked by prisoners. \nDrugs were widespread in the prison Credit: PA P anorama will reveal tonight that prison officers at the site feel unable to keep control and one member of staff told the programme's undercover reporter there is “no discipline at all, [we have] lost control of the jail, yes they go behind the doors but they run the jail, they do because they get whatever they want whenever they want it” adding: “…you will be assaulted, one way or another you will be assaulted in your career”.\nThe team also found major security breaches including a hole in an internal security fence where packages were collected by inmates after being thrown over the outside wall. \nPrisoners were also filmed colouring in picture of Peppa Pig, rather than learning new skills or improving their maths and English. \nThe Ministry of Justice told BBC Panorama:“These are extremely serious allegations which are being urgently investigated. The Justice Secretary has been clear that levels of violence and self-harm in our prisons are too high which is why we are investing an extra £100m annually to boost the frontline by 2,500 officers. \n\"Every officer will be responsible for a case load of six offenders, making sure all prisoners get the support needed to quit drugs and get the education and training that will help turn their lives around. \n“These are long-standing issues which will not be resolved in weeks or months but we are determined to make our prisons places of safety and reform. \n“We have robust processes in place to closely monitor and manage private contractors and will not hesitate to take action when standards fall short.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:28:36.863+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
