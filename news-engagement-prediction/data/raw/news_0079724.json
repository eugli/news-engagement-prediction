Members Sign In Globe Magazine Letter to readers from a single mom struggling to get by in Boston Sandy Guerrier, the subject of a Globe Magazine profile, responds to comments — and criticism. Aram Boghosian for The Boston Globe Sandy Guerrier with daughters Imanie (left) and Amma at dinner on an evening in February By Sandy Guerrier Advertisement \nMy name is Sandy and I am the mother and individual in this story ( Making $50,000 a year and still barely getting by in Boston ). My intention in participating was not to have you pity me but rather to help you understand the face of poverty. My reality is the reality of many people today. \nI would first like to say that I am very aware of every choice I’ve made for my children and for me. I think about all of my options before I decide which ones are in the best interest of my family. I don’t expect anyone to be responsible for the financial choices I have made. The consequences that may come from them are also mine. Get Todays Headlines in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up!

I am also a foster child. So everything that I am — and everything that I still pray to become — is because others have invested their time and love in me. With no savings and no safety net, this single mother hangs on by a thread as she seeks a stable life for her three kids. \nAs far as the online comments concerning my three children being poor planning, well, we all are entitled to our opinions. My children are God’s way of giving me a chance to live a life that I have been cheated out of by unforeseen tragedy. This is not something that I expect everyone to understand, but it’s my truth and my blessing. I have healthy children who are humanists, and they appreciate every opportunity life throws their way as blessings from God. Yes, even in the midst of our financial turmoil. \nAs far as my children’s father is concerned, he is very present and very active in their lives, and he would give his life for his kids. Advertisement \nI am a believer in God. I have a faith that has no limit and no boundaries. I won’t apologize for that faith or what I believe that faith can do and will do. To be honest, if I could find a way to tithe 10 percent of the $80,000 salary I desire, I would. There is an old saying that goes: Tell me where your wealth is and I will tell you what you worship. We all worship something. \nI am a 35-year-old woman living with sickle cell anemia and I gave birth to three beautiful children when I had been told I would not live to see my 10th birthday or be able to have children. He did that, and much more. I am confident that God will provide because he has always provided. \nI love where I live. My children love where they live. They have stability, friends, and routines that are all a product of where we live. I will not change that for anything. More important, I will not have my children’s futures be determined by their ZIP code. Having worked for years in the field of human services, that is a risk I know all too well. \nI have always been a hard worker. I have been working since I was 13. I look forward to going to work every day, whether it is dressing up and going to my 8-to-4 job or my $12-an-hour cleaning or landscaping jobs. I want my children to get up each day knowing the value of work and doing your very best, even when the rewards seems small. Because that’s what living is. That’s where goals, and determination, are born. \nHowever my life may turn out, that is all the wealth I want to leave behind for my children. Because once they have that, they have secured their true trust funds, and I am confident that they will be able to manage anything. \nSo, yes, I know the choices I have made. I know the price I have to pay, because I know where the fruit of my labor is. \nThank you for reading.
