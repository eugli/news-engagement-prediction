Wow pic.twitter.com/9z5OFrYBJZ\n— Dr. Kills (@kayleekillion) January 31, 2017\nIn London, where the crowd was estimated to number at least 10,000 , demonstrators gathered outside the prime minister’s Downing Street residence, filling Whitehall and spreading out around the Cenotaph – a famous war memorial built after the end of World War I.\nLove this banner from the protest in Manchester, UK. #TrumpBan #travelban #trump pic.twitter.com/DI5QOwcA1L\n— Martin Stand (@QuakerWolf) January 30, 2017\nSurrounded by the grand old buildings that house the British government, the people came to register their opposition to the most divisive ruling the Trump administration has conjured up so far and to the role that many feel their own government is playing in legitimizing and normalizing Trump’s actions.\nTrump protest in Bristol, UK #TrumpProtest pic.twitter.com/9lRqM54rIg\n— Ross (@RossiferBid) January 30, 2017\nThe mood was calm but serious on a night when more than one placard and more than one chant referred to Trump as a “fascist,” and “Theresa the Appeaser” was daubed on a host of signs. The references were hard to ignore – just hours before the march on Downing Street, one Labour party MP compared May to Neville Chamberlain, the prime minister famous for appeasing Adolf Hitler just before war broke out.\nThe Edinburgh anti Trump protest really is huge pic.twitter.com/lzJCR0AuW1\n— Liam Kirkaldy (@HolyroodLiam) January 30, 2017\nSpeakers from a broad cross-section of British political life – from mainstream politicians to Muslim activists — were scheduled to speak, but for most, the crowd’s chants made their words were inaudible. Diane Abbott, a key ally of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, said that Islamophobia and scapegoating of Muslims needed to be resisted. “We have got to resist it whether it is in the United States or here in the U.K.,” she added. MP Clive Lewis repeatedly flashed the thumbs-up sign as he walked through the crowd.\nTwo chants held sway: “Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here,” which recalled the massive march held in London in 2015 to show solidarity with refugees. The other focused on Trump: “You can’t build the wall, your hands are too small,” which, for a short while, morphed into the more earthy: “You can’t build the wall, your cock’s too small.”\nWalking through the crowd, activist Bianca Jagger told VICE News why she was there: “I care about others. It’s what I do.”\nAll across the U.K. the protests remained peaceful. In London, Westminster police tweeted pictures of the scene under the caption “Protesters in Whitehall against Donald Trump’s immigration policy. Being policed with no issues.”\n@MPSWestminster pic.twitter.com/0ucb00YYTl\n— Westminster Police (@MPSWestminster) January 30, 2017\nComing just over a week after the women’s marches that took place across the country, this protest marked an escalation in U.K. resistance to a president whose actions have now had a very real impact on people all over the world. From the chants to the banners on display, it was clear that those in the crowd wished their government would adopt some of that resistance too.\n. @theresa_may You're the Prime Minister. Get on the phone to the President and tell him the ban cannot stand. And do it today.\n— Ed Miliband (@Ed_Miliband) January 29, 2017\nCover: Ik Aldama/picture-alliance/dpa/AP Images", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/TrumpBan?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/MPSWestminster/status/826153548392042497", "https://t.co/9lRqM54rIg", "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/30/nazi-jibes-donald-trump-demean-holocaust-says-boris-johnson/", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Thousands", "https://twitter.com/HolyroodLiam/status/826142997951676417", "https://t.co/lzJCR0AuW1", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/trump?src=hash", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/12/refugees-welcome-uk-marchers-un-warns-war-syria-million-displaced", "https://twitter.com/MPSWestminster", "https://t.co/9z5OFrYBJZ", "https://twitter.com/theresa_may", "https://twitter.com/Ed_Miliband/status/825745281098584064", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/travelban?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/TrumpProtest?src=hash", "https://t.co/DI5QOwcA1L", "http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/ten-thousand-brits-protest-against-9724841", "https://twitter.com/RossiferBid/status/826179378262458372", "https://twitter.com/kayleekillion/status/826247867488727040", "https://twitter.com/QuakerWolf/status/826169975228493824", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.vice.com%2Fstory%2Fthousands-march-across-the-uk-in-protest-at-trumps-refugee-ban", "https://t.co/0ucb00YYTl"], "published": "2017-01-31T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:44:12.528+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
