He threatened to move another no-confidence motion against Palaniswami while describing his government as a “proxy” of the convicted AIADMK general secretary VK Sasikala. \nStalin left no one in doubt that it is not former caretaker chief minister O Paneerselvam but the DMK that is leading the charge against the Sasikala faction of the ruling AIADMK. \nStalin also questioned the legitimacy of the current state government and said that the party would be seeking an appointment with President Pranab Mukherjee to submit a report about what happened during the trust vote on Saturday. \n“The entire state has seen political turmoil for nine months,” he said on Monday. “Nothing that subsequent governments, including Palaniswami’s, have announced have been put into effect. They have all remained at the proposal stage.” \nPromising that the opposition would push for a no-confidence motion in the next assembly session, Stalin termed the events of Saturday, where all 89 of the DMK’s MLAs were expelled by the speaker, as being “against the laws of the assembly.” He also dismissed allegations from the AIADMK that they had engaged in violent activities. \n“If I hit you and someone hits me back, that is violence,” the DMK leader said. “We shouted slogans, challenged the AIADMK, and sat in protest in the assembly. How can you call that violence?” \nStalin also tried to leverage the state-wide hunger protests on Wednesday which were organised by the DMK. \n“Despite being organised by the DMK, the protests were not about one party tackling another, but about the people of the state questioning their government,” he said as he invited the youth and students to boost the opposition ranks against the Sasikala faction. \nThe DMK had moved the Madras high court to declare the results of Saturday’s elections null and void. The case will be heard on Tuesday. Read more ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T04:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:12:59.205+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
