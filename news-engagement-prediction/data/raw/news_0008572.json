Diane Abbott swerves questions after missing Brexit vote DIANE ABBOTT swerved several questions from a journalist about why she failed to attend the key Commons Brexit vote. PUBLISHED: 22:18, Thu, Feb 2, 2017 | UPDATED: 22:20, Thu, Feb 2, 2017 \nThe Jeremy Corbyn ally is facing calls to resign after she didn’t vote on Theresa May ’s bill which would allow the Government to formally start Britain’s European Union divorce proceedings. \nMs Abbott, a staunch Remainer, claimed she was too sick to attend the vote, where she would’ve been expected to follow Labour’s three-line whip, which called on MPs to back the Government’s plans for Brexit . \nITN journalist Nick Wallace approached Ms Abbott after she was spotted arriving home by car. \nIn the footage, the reporter can be heard shouting: “Could you give us just two minutes of your time, please?
