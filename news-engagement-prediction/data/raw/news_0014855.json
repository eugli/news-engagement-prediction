Date To Be Announced.” The caption reads: “The will of the people will stand.” A photo posted by Women's March (@womensmarch) on Feb 6, 2017 at 8:03am PST \nAlthough details about the strike are scarce ― the above Instagram post appears to be the only information that has been made public, and Women’s March organizers did not respond to The Huffington Post’s request for comment ― the general reaction has been largely positive. \nAs of Monday afternoon, the initial Instagram post had already received more than 17,000 likes. The Women’s March also posted the news on Twitter and Facebook , where many users commented in support of a strike. \nMany celebrities retweeted the news in support. “Hit ‘em in the wallet,” writer and comedian Corinne Fisher wrote on Twitter. Feminist writer Jessica Valenti added: “I am so here for this.” This is what I'm talking about. Hit 'em in the wallet. https://t.co/rEj1ckAjra ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T02:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T21:37:42.583+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
