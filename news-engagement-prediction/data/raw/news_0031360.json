Picture: AAP News Corp Australia Network Share on Twitter \nTAKE it or leave it — that is Pauline Hanson’s furious response to her WA One Nation candidates whingeing about a preference deal with the Liberal Party. \nSpeaking on ABC TV’s 7.30 , an irate Ms Hanson told candidates such as David Miller and Dane Sorenson, who have threatened to disobey her move to preference One Nation in the Lower House, they can leave the party if they don’t like what she says. \n“They are under a banner, the banner is Pauline Hanson’s One Nation,” she told the program. \n“They’ve joined Pauline Hanson’s One Nation and I’ve said right from the very beginning, I will run this party, meaning right from the top … who stands, policies, preferences. Pauline Hanson says candidates can leave One Nation if they are not happy with a preference deal. Picture: AAP Source: AAP \n“I have to make the decisions, I am leader of this party. If they’re not happy with it, everyone has a choice, don’t stand under my name. Don’t stand for Pauline Hanson’s One Nation, they have every right to go and stand as an independent under their own name.” \nMs Hanson said the preference deal wasn’t made to ensure the survival of Colin Barnett’s government and that people were free to ignore the party’s how-to-vote cards. \n“The how-to-vote card is a recommendation,” she said. \nTURNBULL NEEDS HANSON TO STAY IN POWER \n“I encourage all voters, you take control of your vote. If you want to vote one for One Nation, thank you,” she said. \n“’If you want to put a two to any other political party, or Labor or Liberal, or whoever — that’s your choice, take control of your vote.” \nEarlier on 7.30 , Mr Miller, who is standing for the seat of Collie-Preston, said he wasn’t happy about the preference deal. \n“I wasn’t told. I found out about it in the Sunday Times and reading social media,” he told the program. \n“How it looks to me, is to get people into the Upper House at the expense of people in the Lower House. \n“Less than impressed.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T16:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T12:01:45.090+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
