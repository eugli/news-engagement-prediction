But she and others at the council are looking to do more.\n\"It's a form of harm reduction,\" she said â€” especially in the age of fentanyl and carfentanil: two deadly opiods that have killed many across Canada in the last year.\n\"We've done a lot of research in this area and we would like nothing more than to have this brought forward into Saskatchewan,\" she said.\nLafond isn't sure when such a centre could open.\nSask. battling high HIV rates The idea is being developed as Saskatchewan continues its battle with the highest rate of HIV in the country.\nAnd Lafond said health officials don't know how bad the problem really is.\n'We've come a very long way': Sask.
