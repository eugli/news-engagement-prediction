And as luck would have it, inspired by Tom Brady , Patriots mounted the most stunning comeback in the NFL 's history winning 34-28 in overtime. And Bouchard, well she would learn a lesson not to bet against the now 5-time Super Bowl winner Brady.\nIt all started with a premature tweet from Bouchard claiming that she knew Falcons would win, even while the game was on.\nI knew Atlanta would win btw\nâ€” Genie Bouchard (@geniebouchard) February 6, 2017\nBut one of her 996k followers, @punslayintwoods, took the chance to bet against Falcons and asked Bouchard for a date if Patriots won.\n@geniebouchard if patriots win we go on a date?\nâ€” TW1 (@punslayintwoods) February 6, 2017\nBouchard casually replied 'Sure', probably thinking that there no chance Flacons could blow this up. As Patriots mounted the comeback the 22-year-old started getting nervous:\nOmfg\nâ€” Genie Bouchard (@geniebouchard) February 6, 2017\nAnd finally when Falcons blew it, Bouchard had lost the bet and @punslayintwoods had got himself a date with the Tennis star. Bouchard was sporting enough ask were the person lived but sent out a tweet saying she learned the lesson that never bet against Brady.\nSo...where do you live? https://t.co/mfucQ0C9VL\nâ€” Genie Bouchard (@geniebouchard) February 6, 2017\nLesson learned.
