The Japanese automaker started up a new production line this month for the Mirage compact with help from trading house Sojitz , switching to local output for a model it had imported from Thailand. Mitsubishi Motors boasts a roughly 15% share of the Philippine auto market, second only to Toyota Motor , and hopes to raise the figure further. \nIn Indonesia, Mitsubishi Motors will boost its dealership count by 20% to 300 and double maintenance staffers to 3,000. A sales arm there that also handles commercial vehicles from Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus will be reorganized in April, with a new unit to focus solely on passenger vehicles. Mitsubishi Motors has also built a new factory that will manufacture a new multipurpose vehicle due out this fall. \nThe Thai dealership network will expand 6% to 230. \nThe automaker plans to capitalize on its strength in Southeast Asia -- which accounts for a fifth of its global sales -- in its partnership with Nissan Motor , which took a 34% stake in October. Mitsubishi Motors will produce multipurpose vehicles for Nissan in Indonesia, as well as join hands with its larger peer on parts procurement. It will continue to manage its own sales strategy for now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T11:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T10:15:06.325+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
