The actor responded positively with regards to a prequel setting. \n“You can always go back, and it’s always interesting to see these character’s stories, and yes, I wouldn’t mind going back and doing that,” Mikkelsen responded. “But obviously, you also can’t do that in a Doctor Strange film because it would be like eight hours long of everyone’s backstory.” \nMikkelsen said that if there was a chance to go back and explore that backstory, it would be fun. \n“But for the actors, it’s not a big checklist thing,” he added. “We know what the story is and we’ve talked about it, but we just take off from the moment when the story starts and then have to carry that responsibility ourselves from then on.” \nIt’s worth noting that the character didn’t exactly die in the film, he was just cast into Dormammu’s dimension for an eternity of torment at the dark lord’s hands. So a return is on the table! Whether Marvel Studios brings him back is another story. \nWhat did you think of Doctor Strange ? Let us know with your own ranking in our Movie Database.
