What: \nThe old South isn't completely gone with the wind in North Little Rock. A short drive from McCain mall will bring you to a quiet, tranquil place that looks like something from an old movie. As a matter of fact, it was featured in the opening credits of \" Gone With the Wind .\" It's believed to be the only remaining structure from that film.The location doesn't feature into the film at all, however. According to the Arkansas Department of Tourism, Cary Bradburn with the North Little Rock History Commission offers this explanation for why it was used in the film: \nJames P. Faucette, North Little Rock’s third mayor, lived in West Hollywood in southern California from 1917 to the mid-1930s. Faucette was a friend of Justin Matthews [builder of the mill] and the two men corresponded on a regular basis. However, I have found nothing concerning your question in the Faucette papers at the Butler Center. Most of the personal letters are from the teens. I suspect that the Faucette connection had something to do with it. So, I guess we still have a ‘history mystery’ but it just adds to the romance surrounding the mill.” \ncontinue reading below our video Best Road Trip Apps \nSo, put on your hoop squirt, grab your parasol and your \"twiddly dee dee\" attitude and come for a visit to learn more about this history mystery.

History: \nThe Old Mill is not actually as old as it appears. In 1933, Justin Matthews contracted for the construction of a replica of an old-water-powered grist mill. He did not set out to copy any preexisting mill, but instead chose to design something that would fit with the contour of the area. He wanted the mill to appear as if it belonged in Arkansas and had been here since the 1800s. The Mill is intended to appear neglected, just as old mills that were in service in the early 1800's had become by the 1930's. \nEven though the park looks natural, and like it was constructed with vines and bark, most of the decorations are concrete. The park is decorated with sculptures of toadstools, tree stumps, and a tree branch-entwined bridge that connects the mill to the rest of the park. Senor Dionico Rodriguez , a sculptor and artist of Mexico City, was responsible for all the details of each piece of concrete work made to represent wood, iron or stone, as well as the designing of the foot bridges and rustic seats. During the summer of 1991, Rodriguez's work at the Old Mill was renovated by the great-nephew of the original artist, Carlos Cortes. \nThe Old Mill was nationally recognized in 1986 by being placed on the National Register of Historic Places.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:53:42.980+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
