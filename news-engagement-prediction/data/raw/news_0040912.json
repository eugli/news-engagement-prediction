As well as giving a one-off performance with the boys, Robbie co-judge alongside Gary, Dannii Minogue and Martin Kemp and the public will decide which band will be crowned the winners of Let It Shine. Meanwhile a source recently told The Sun , Jason was reportedly not invited back. Guest appearance: The 43-year-old crooner will reunite with Take That for a one-off performance- but Jason Orange (far left) will not join 'Robbie seems very keen to get on board, so things are looking good. But in the end, Gary decided not to even ask Jason,' the source said. With Jason out of the picture, Gary is pouring his energy into making sure their reunion as a four-piece is a huge success and blows the audience away.' 'He wanted to finish off Let It Shine with a bang and he thought a Take That reunion to close the show was the perfect way to achieve it.' Robbie last reunited with Take That last November during a special one-off show to celebrate receiving the prestigious BRITs Icon Award. It comes as Robbie confessed he would jump at the chance to rejoin former his former Take That bandmates for a reunion tour. The star admitted he was 'really proud' of what the pop group have achieved, describing himself as a 'floating member'. Quizzed whether he would ever rejoin the band, Robbie revealed his upcoming tour would clash with a 2017 reunion, but he was keen to mark their 25th anniversary in some way. 'I'm looking forward to being back with Gary, Mark and Howard on Let It Shine and am excited to be a guest judge for the very special final,' Robbie revealed He told The Sun: 'I don’t think it’ll be next year but I think it’ll be at some point... We’ll wait and see when our paths collide.' Asked whether he believed fellow former member Jason Orange - who quit the band for good in 2014 - would return, Robbie wasn't so sure. Discussing Jason's departure from the limelight, he said: 'This line of work is not for everybody and I don’t think [it's] for Jay, for whatever reasons.' In 2014 Jason announced his decision to walk away from Take That – where he enjoyed more than two-decades of chart success. Expert: Robbie as well as joining the talent show as a guest judge, alongside Gary, Dannii Minogue, Amber Riley and Martin Kemp At the time sources claimed Jason was never comfortable with the lack of privacy that comes with life in the public eye after he shot to fame in the mid-nineties, alongside current members Gary Barlow, Howard Donald and Mark Owen as well as former bandmate Robbie Williams. The group returned to the music scene after a ten-year hiatus in 2006, but Jason was the only member of the band to steer clear of the music scene during their decade long break, opting instead to try his hand at acting. Jason maintained there had been 'no fallings out' but casted doubt over his lack of motivation to continue promoting and touring. 'I want to start by saying how proud I am of what we have achieved together over the years,' he said in a statement. 'However, at a band meeting last week I confirmed to Mark, Gary and Howard that I do not wish to commit to recording and promoting a new album. Winners? The public will decide which band will be crowned the winners of Let It Shine on the final episode on the 25 February 'I have spent some of the best years of my life with Take That and I'd like to thank everyone who has been a part of my journey, including my bandmates, who I feel are like brothers to me. 'Most especially my gratitude goes to all of the good and kind, beautiful and ever-loyal fans of the band, without whom none of this could have been possible. Thank you.' This comes as BRITs Icon Robbie gave one of his biggest fans, Danielle Howting from Gosport Hants, a surprise of a lifetime. As part of Mastercard’s Priceless Surprises campaign in celebration of The BRIT Awards 2017, Danielle, who met her partner at one of Robbie’s concerts, thought she was taking part in a documentary about Robbie’s biggest fans. When she went to her local cinema with some family and friends on a night-out, she was surprised with a film of Robbie at her house, living a day in her life. The culmination of the surprise was revealed when he appeared from behind the cinema screen and took to the stage with her nice-year-old daughter, Grace, to perform Love My Life– a song Robbie wrote for his own children from his new album, The Heavy Entertainment Show.
