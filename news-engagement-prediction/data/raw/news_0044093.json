Even as a kid, I used to have little fights with my mother about how much water needs to be given to plants so that they grow well,” Avani Jain told us over nimbu pani at Upaj, her natural farm on Sama Savli road in Vadodara, Gujarat. She studied architecture and practised for awhile but soon realised that farming is all that she wanted to do. Following her heart, she decided to take up a small piece of land that her family owned in the outskirts of the city and start her experiments. \nSeven years later, the city has swallowed the land around but Upaj has blossomed into a rich, fertile farm feeding many with natural, organic produce. “It has been a long journey, hard but fun. I have tried out various techniques, learning from the local women employed at the farm, experts like Deepak Suchde and sometimes intuition. Taking what I connect with, Upaj farm is doing fairly well now,” says Avani. The farm also has a large pond dug up which stores all the rainwater and also beautifies the area. Rain water harvested at the farm \n\nCabbage, Spinach and more \nThe farm has been supplying vegetables to a group of 20 subscribers and also via an Upaj outlet in the main city. They follow a subscription model where people can either book a 3kg or 5kg pack on a weekly basis. Every Thursday, the vegetables are harvested and delivered fresh in the morning at the customer’s doorstep. Their pricing comes out to be around Rs 70/kg. Patrons can pick up vegetables at the store as well but the focus is on increasing the subscriber base. \nUpaj also conducts workshops and seminars for corporates, school visits and groups interested in learning more about natural farming. “Vadodara is a tough market for something like Upaj to survive. People appreciate the effort but when it comes to paying a little extra, there is resistance,” says Avani. Metros like Bengaluru and Delhi have shown an increasing appetite for more natural genuine products and it is only a matter of time till it percolates Tier I and II cities. \nThe spurt in the demand for organic products has also led to the rise of many brands trying to charge an extra premium, which makes it difficult for the end consumer to choose a genuine initiative. And these are the challenges initiatives like Upaj have to tackle. For Avani, she has been able to do it because of a very supportive family who has been with her in all her explorations that have resulted in a well-managed farm that employs 5-6 local women from the villages. \nTo keep the venture sustainable, they also built a small cottage industry around seeds and growing plants. Upaj has a ‘grow-it-yourself’ kit for kids (and adults) to experience the joy of growing a plant. “People in cities hardly get the space to experience growing a vegetable and fruit and I really want more people to experience the joy of doing it,” says Avani about the intention behind these kits.
