What’s so hard? What’s so fucking hard about following the GPS?! \nAs her driver struggled helplessly with the navigation system, Dudley continued to Snapchat the scene with vulgar commentary. At one point, she dramatically looked at her naked wrist and complained that she would be 30 minutes late to her destination. YouTube \nDudley repeatedly yelled obscenities at the cab driver throughout the entire incident, and toward the end of their encounter, she threatened to fight him. \nThis girl obviously sucks, but even I have to admit that I giggled a little when she angrily spelled out, “K-A-M-E-R-U-K-A” for the driver. And, to his credit, she spelled that out WAY too fast for any reasonable human to comprehend. \nUnfortunately, other cab drivers have attested to the fact that incidents like this are fairly common. \nOne driver told 7 News : \nI’ve had it before this myself but my experience, you calm the passenger down. \nAccording to the Daily Mail Australia , a spokesman for Black & White Cabs declined to comment. \nSince her barrage of Snapchats clearly wasn’t terrible enough on its own, after the report aired on the news, Dudley bragged about how the whole debacle led her to amass several thousand more viewers on Snapchat. YouTube \nIt’s only a matter of time now until Tamika Dudley becomes a walking, talking meme just like Danielle Bregoli (if she isn’t already one, that is). \nBut now, we must decide, who’s worse? Danielle Bregoli or Tamika Dudley?
