Hidden Morocco \nThink Morocco and exotic souks, snake charmers and bartering for rugs might come to mind. \nYou can experience all this on a journey to Marrakesh with Water By Nature but it also includes a trip to the Atlas Mountains where your raft awaits. \nStunning scenery, hidden gorges and exciting rapids can be found along the river Ahansel. \nThe night skies around the campfires are out of this world. \nExtras could include quad biking, a hot air balloon trip or a camel ride. Tonga Survivor (Picture: Getty) \nWhat’s more adventurous than choosing to get stranded on a deserted island with no shelter, water or equipment to catch your dinner? \nOn this Tonga Survivor Island Expedition, you’ll have to work with your fellow travellers to figure out how to survive. \nIt’s like a disaster movie or The Island, only without the cameras (which might be a blessing when it turns out you’re less like Bear Grylls than you thought).
