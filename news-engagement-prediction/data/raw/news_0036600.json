Canned fruits -Price increase: 32.0% \nAnd thanks to out of control government spending and reckless manipulation by the Federal Reserve, we have come to a time when inflation is starting to accelerate once again. \nAccording to John Williams of shadowstats.com, if honest numbers were being used the government would be telling us that inflation is rising at a 6 percent annual rate for the first time since 2011. \nAt the same time, evidence is mounting that U.S. consumers are simply tapped out. Previously, I have explained that interest rates are going up, consumer bankruptcies are rising , and lending standards for consumers are really tightening up . \nAll of those are things we would expect to see if a new recession was starting. \nAnd today we learned that the number of Americans refinancing their homes has fallen to the lowest level that we have seen since 2009 … \nA slowdown in refinancing pulled down the total mortgage application volume last week as changes to certain government-loan programs made refinances less lucrative. Refinance volume now stands at its lowest level since June 2009. \nIf you will remember, we also saw a slowdown in mortgage refinancing just before the great financial crisis of 2008. \nFor mortgage applications overall, they are now down almost 31 percent from where they were a year ago… \nTotal mortgage application volume fell 3.7 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis last week from the previous week, and are nearly 31 percent lower than the same week a year ago, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. \nA 31 percent decline in a single year is catastrophic. \nIf this continues, it won’t be too long before everyone is talking about a new housing crash. \nAnd we also learned this week that FHA mortgage delinquencies increased during the fourth quarter “for the first time since 2006″ … \nFederal Housing Administration mortgage delinquencies jumped in the fourth quarter for the first time since 2006, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported Wednesday. The FHA insures low down-payment loans and is a favorite among first-time homebuyers. \n\nThe seasonally adjusted FHA delinquency rate increased to 9.02 percent in the fourth quarter from 8.3 percent in the third quarter, MBA data show. \nSo many things are happening right now that we have not seen happen in many years, but most people are choosing not to see the red flags that are popping up all around us. \nNone of our long-term economic problems have been fixed. And even though Donald Trump won the election, the truth is that our economy is in the worst shape it has been since the last financial crisis. I continue to encourage all of my readers to get prepared for very hard times, but just like back in 2007 we are experiencing a wave of tremendous optimism right now and most people think that the party can somehow continue indefinitely. \nWhether Donald Trump won the election or not, the truth is that a major economic downturn was going to come anyway . You see, Donald Trump is not some magician that can just wave a wand and somehow make the consequences of decades of very foolish decisions instantly disappear. \nWe have been on the biggest debt binge in human history, and there is going to be a great price to pay when this immense debt bubble finally bursts. \nUnfortunately, most people are not going to acknowledge the truth until it is too late.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T22:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T17:55:54.915+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
