Here's why this second biggest city in Telangana deserves to be visited at least once. \nThe ancient capital of the Kakatiya dynasty, Warangal is replete with historical grandeur. The city has now been chosen for HRIDAY (Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana) scheme by the Government of India. Besides, the Department of Tourism recently announced its plans of developing an eco-tourism circuit around the city. \nThis tourist destination can be reached from Rajiv Gandhi International Airport, Hyderabad.
