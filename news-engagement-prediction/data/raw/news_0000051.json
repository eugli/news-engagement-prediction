The jury based the damages award on finding a series of copyright and trademark violations involving ZeniMax software by one or more of the defendants, a group that included Oculus and several of its employees. The biggest portion of the award stemmed from the finding that Palmer Luckey, an Oculus founder, had violated a confidentiality agreement he signed with ZeniMax as he was forming Oculus. ZeniMax said it was exploring options for preventing Oculus from its continued use of computer code that infringes ZeniMax copyrights, including seeking a court order. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “Technology is the foundation of our business and we consider the theft of our intellectual property to be a serious matter,” said Robert Altman, ZeniMax’s chairman and chief executive. “We appreciate the jury’s finding against the defendants, and the award of half a billion dollars in damages for those serious violations.” That figure may decrease as litigation between the companies continues. But Facebook may not be too worried about it. As the results announced Wednesday showed, Facebook’s dominance in internet advertising is surpassed only by Google. And Ms. Sandberg’s latest efforts to woo small businesses is paying off: Tens of millions of businesses market their products across Facebook and Instagram, the photo-sharing app it owns. Shares of Facebook rose 2.5 percent, to $136.69, in after-hours trading. Wall Street is looking for Facebook to show revenue growth outside of its news feed, the social network’s moneymaking ad machine. The company has cautioned analysts that it is nearing the limit of its ad load — the amount of ads it chooses to place between user-posted content like news stories and status updates — inside the feed. That means increased pressure on properties like Instagram, which recently announced that it has more than 600 million users. Though Facebook does not disclose revenue figures for Instagram, it said on Wednesday that five million businesses are now on the app, and that its latest feature — a messaging service similar to Snapchat — is already being used by a quarter of Instagram’s user base.
