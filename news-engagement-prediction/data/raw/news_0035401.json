The 2017 World Wide Developers Conference will take place June 5-9 at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose, California.\nThat's just around the corner from Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, but the location of the 2017 event does mark a change. In recent years, WWDC has been a San Francisco happening.\nDevelopers can apply for WWDC tickets here , starting March 27.\nThough the event is designed for developers, the opening press conference is popular among Apple fans in general. Last year, Apple showed off iOS 10 for the iPhone and iPad and debuted a Home app , better Siri integration and better Maps .\nApple's starting off 2017 on a high note. On New Year's Day, the company's App Store had its biggest single day ever , with $240 million in sales. A few weeks later, Apple announced that fourth-quarter iPhone sales hit record highs.\nMeanwhile, expectations are running strong for the iPhone 8 , or whatever Apple officially calls the next version of its marquee device. It's likely to be unveiled in September.\nIn the company's earnings call at the end of January, CEO Tim Cook fanned the flames of fanboy anticipation.\n\"The smartphone is still in the early innings of the game,\" Cook said. \"I think there's lots more to do... We've got some exciting things in the pipeline. I still feel really, really good about it.\"\nDoes the Mac still matter? Apple execs tell why the MacBook Pro was over four years in the making, and why we should care.\nBatteries Not Included : The CNET team shares experiences that remind us why tech stuff is cool.", "external_links": ["https://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/img/wxBu2FLDnnkOuEeFTf4UIqdPFko=/0x430:2560x1920/fit-in/970x0/2016/06/13/a9ad391d-7664-4d42-80b3-0dff53bb3c61/wwdc-2016-slides-153.jpg", "https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/"], "published": "2017-02-16T14:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:30:50.944+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
