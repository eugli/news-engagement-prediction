Other launches included a lighter version of LinkedIn and a showcase of Project Sangam -- a skilling tool. \nAs Mukesh Ambani-promoted Reliance Jio is looking to cut down on data prices, technology giants such as Google, Facebook and Microsoft on the other hand are coming up with products that will run even on 2G or unstable connections. \nThe latest product annoucements were made on Wednesday by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and the new products wants to bring people from low connectivity areas on the internet. \nSkype Lite \nThe CEO launched a Skype Lite app for Android with Aadhaar and bot capabilities and the size of the app is just 18MB. But how does it help you? \nFor starters it will aims to help you to stay connected all the time. “Skype Lite is optimized for 2G and unstable network connections, so you can stay connected with friends and family,” the company claims, adding that it is battery-friendly and runs on old Android mobile devices as well. So if you don’t have the latest Android OS, Skype Lite will work. However, exact Android OS compatibility have not been announced. \nThe Skype Lite also includes a reduced data usage mode for video calls. You can even find out exactly how much data you’re using with one tap. Additionally, Skype Lite can also merge with text messages on the phone if allowed and can act as one window for all kinds of texts and messages. The Lite app also supports Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, Telegu and Urdu. \nThe Lite app also comes in with Aadhaar capability linked and that means that users can verify Aadhaar data on the go in the form of OTPs generated more like ordering food or using Paytm. Users can chat with ‘Aadhaar Verified’ users on both the regular Skype app and the new Skype Lite app while interacting for job interviews, government services and other services. \nLinkedIn Lite and Placements \nWell this one too comes as a no-brainer as Microsoft is targetting users from low connectivity zones. LinkedIn India has 39 million users and this is going to increase if users can log on to LinkedIn from unstable network zones.” We are launching LinkedIn Lite to help people from low connectivity zones look for economic opportunities. Other new products include a Placements app that will help college graduate get better jobs,” Nadella said. \nThis means that college graduates will now find it easier to connect with recruiters for jobs and internships via placements. Also, companies will get more candidates to choose from when more users come to the platform. \nProject Sangam \nThis is currently in private preview but once launched this will be one of the most effective tools for skilling Indian citizens. Project Sangam will be an open ceosystem where trainers can pour their content into Sangam and people can take the training right from Sangam and apply for jobs. \nThe service can be started by first logging in with the Aadhar Praman service from Microsoft, then the user can choose to create a LinkedIn Profile and then enrol under courses for skill training. Lessons can be downloaded for offline viewing. Salary and location are also matched after the courses are taken and then jobs are recommended. The candidate’s profile is also shared with the employer. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T12:30:44.337+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
