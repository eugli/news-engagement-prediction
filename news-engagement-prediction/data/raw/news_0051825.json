Tangail Correspondent | Update: 12:13, Feb 19, 2017 0 Like \nBangladesh Awami League general secretary and road transport and bridges minister Obaidul Quader physically assaulted a member of parliament (MP), Sanowar Hossain, in Tangail on Saturday.Witnesses said the AL MP from Tangail-5 constituency, Sanowar, faced the 'wrath' of the new ruling party general secretary when he tried to defend a newly elected party MP.The incident took place at the Padma rest house of Jamuna Resort at one end of the Bangabandhu Bridge at 8:45pm on Saturday.According to accounts by eye witnesses, on his way back from attending a party meeting in Rajshahi, Obaidul Quader stopped for a break at the Jamuna Resort.Tangail district AL president Fazlur Rahman Khan and general secretary Jowaherul Islam, MP Sanowar Hossain, MP Anupam Shahjahan Joy and other leaders and activists of AL and its front organisations had already arrived there to greet him.As the minister arrived at the spot, the party workers began chanting the ‘Joy Bangla’ slogan. He expressed his irritation and told them to stop.The newly elected MP from Tangail-4 (Kalihati) Hasan Imam Khan had invited Obaidul Quader to stop over for refreshments. However, Hasan Imam was not present there as he had gone to offer prayers at the shrine of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in Tungipara, Gopalganj.Obaidul Quader was annoyed at Hasan Imam’s absence and angrily abused him. Sanowar Hossain MP began to explain, in defence of Hasan Imam, but that simply enraged the minister further. In his anger, Obaidul Quader slapped and punched Sanowar Hossain and walked out of the rest house up till the gate.He, however, apologised to the party leaders there and left for Dhaka.Sanowar Hossain could not be contacted as his mobile was found switched off.Several Awami League leaders present at the time confirmed the incident.Obaidul Quader did not reply to his mobile phone.
