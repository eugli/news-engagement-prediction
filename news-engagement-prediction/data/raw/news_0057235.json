And Trump is not into either of those things\"â€”Katherine Mangu-Ward. \nAt the 10th annual International Students for Liberty Conference , Reason magazine Editor in Chief Katherine Mangu-Ward, former editor and longtime head of the Institute for Humane Studies Marty Zupan, and I discussed the history and future of Reason and libertarianism in President Donald Trump's America.\nWe each talked about the signature issues of the decades we were at the magazine's helm (the 1980s for Zupan, the '00s for me, and currently for Mangu-Ward) and whether libertarianism is waxing or waning.\nThis podcast was recorded live on Friday, February 17. Now finishing up its first decade, SFL reported that about 1,700 guests from all over the world attended this year's conference.\nProduced by Mark McDaniel.\nSubscribe to the Reason podcast at iTunes or click below to listen right now!\n\nDon't miss a single Reason podcast!
