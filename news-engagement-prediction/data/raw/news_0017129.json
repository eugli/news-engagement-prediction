Blend Images - Eric Raptosh Photography, Getty Images By Todd Helmenstine Updated September 11, 2016 . \nThis example problem demonstrates how to calculate the root mean square velocity of particles in an ideal gas. Root Mean Square Velocity Problem \nWhat is the average velocity or root mean square velocity of a molecule in a sample of oxygen at 0 °C? Solution Gases consist of atoms or molecules that move at different speeds in random directions. The root mean square velocity (RMS velocity) is a way to find a single velocity value for the particles. The average velocity of gas particles is found using the root mean square velocity formulaμ rms = (3RT/M) ½ T = absolute temperature in KelvinM = mass of a mole of the gas in kilograms .The temperature must be converted to Kelvin and the molar mass must be found in kg to complete this problem. Step 1 Find the absolute temperature using the Celsius to Kelvin conversion formula:T = °C + 273 Step 2 Find molar mass in kg:From the periodic table , molar mass of oxygen = 16 g/mol. \ncontinue reading below our video 10 Best Universities in the United States Oxygen gas (O 2 ) is comprised of two oxygen atoms bonded together. Therefore: molar mass of O 2 = 2 x 16molar mass of O 2 = 32 g/molConvert this to kg/mol:molar mass of O 2 = 32 g/mol x 1 kg/1000 gmolar mass of O 2 = 3.2 x 10 -2 kg/mol Step 3 - Find μ rms μ rms = [3(8.3145 (kg·m 2 /sec 2 )/K·mol)(273 K)/3.2 x 10 -2 kg/mol] ½ μ rms = (2.128 x 10 5 m 2 /sec 2 ) ½ μ rms = 461 m/sec Answer: The average velocity or root mean square velocity of a molecule in a sample of oxygen at 0 °C is 461 m/sec.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:48:56.187+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
