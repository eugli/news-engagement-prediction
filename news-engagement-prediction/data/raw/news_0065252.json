Problems in managing inmates arise when the jail reaches those numbers. Deputies must sort and house inmates based on their crimes, gang-affiliation, gender and other factors, and that becomes more difficult when there is little space open behind bars. \nThe overcrowding has led to an increase in assaults on deputies and between inmates, he said. \n“This creates an environment where it is practically impossible to maintain safety and security,” Britton said. \nBritton also criticized Sheriff Patrick Firman and Stephanie O’Malley, the executive director of the Department of Safety, for poor leadership and for failing to respond to their complaints. \nIn response to the rally, Firman issued an “open letter to the community” on Wednesday afternoon to reaffirm his commitment to criminal justice reforms that would reduce mass incarceration. \n“Here in Denver, our sheriff-department transformation is progressing through a multi-faceted approach to address staff and inmate safety, manage jail population and engage our community — key aspects of that work locally,” the letter said. \nIn a statement e-mailed to The Denver Post, O’Malley said, “I am not surprised that the FOP, through ridiculous claims, would make attempts to point fingers at others like myself rather than focus its efforts and attention on remedying the problems that have been pervasive inside of Denver’s detention facilities for far too long. Be that as it may, I remain focused on the steadfast work the sheriff is leading to enhance and better the Denver Sheriff Department.” Tags: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:00:08.765+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
