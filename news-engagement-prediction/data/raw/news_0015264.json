But there is no need right now at this time for military maneuvers or something like that, that would solve something that’s best solved by the diplomats,” he added. \nU.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said in his Senate confirmation hearing that China should not be allowed access to islands it has built in the contested South China Sea . The White Ho us e also vowed to defend “international territories” in the strategic waterway. \nBut how the United States would achieve that has been unclear, including whether it would have a military dimension. \nChina claims most of the South China Sea , while Taiwan, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Brunei claim parts of the waters that command strategic sea lanes and have rich fishing grounds along with oil and gas deposits.
