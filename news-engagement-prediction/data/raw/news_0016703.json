Temperature of Freezing Water from a Liquid to a Solid The freezing point or melting point of water is the temperature at which water changes phase from a liquid to a solid or vice versa. Mark Mawson / Getty Images Updated November 20, 2016 . Question: What Is the Freezing Point of Water? \nWhat is the freezing point of water or the melting point of water? Are the freezing point and melting point the same? Are there any factors that affect the freezing point of water? Here's a look at the answers to these common questions. \nAnswer: The freezing point or melting point of water is the temperature at which water changes phase from a liquid to a solid or vice versa. The freezing point describes the liquid to solid transition while the melting point is the temperature at which water goes from a solid (ice) to liquid water. In theory, the two temperatures would be the same, but liquids can be supercooled beyond their freezing points so that they don't solidify until well below freezing point. Ordinarily the freezing point of water is 0° C or 32° F. The temperature may be lower if supercooling occurs or if there are impurities present in the water which could cause freezing point depression to occur.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:47:18.596+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
