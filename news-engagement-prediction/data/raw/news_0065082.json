She also was met with protests . \nWhile 100 people crammed into her town hall gathering about 30 miles from Nashville, another 100 people outside chanted about immigrant rights, Planned Parenthood and other topics in protest against the congresswoman and the President. \nBlackburn's town hall was among several protests lobbed at GOP members of Congress returning home this week on break to their districts around the US. Now many Republican lawmakers are opting against holding public town halls, instead organising conference calls or meeting privately. \nRead more Trump 'has lied for every single one of his 33 days as President' The crowd inside Blackburn's event held up signs that said “agree” and “disagree,” and at times yelled out “alternative facts” and “shame on you for lying” after Blackburn's responses. \n“I have always said, you may not agree with me, but you're always going to know where I stand,” Blackburn told the protesters outside Fairview City Hall afterward. “Having a good, solid, respectful debate, that is something that serves our country well.” \nA month into Trump's presidency, protests continue over his immigration policies, Cabinet selections and the GOP's push to repeal the Affordable Care Act, without all the specifics on how to replace it. At the town halls, protesters are probing their lawmakers to see if they will veer from some of Trump's more controversial decisions, and if they will promise coverage for those currently served by the Affordable Care Act . \nTrump took to Twitter on Tuesday to address the town halls. \nThe so-called angry crowds in home districts of some Republicans are actually, in numerous cases, planned out by liberal activists. Sad!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 21, 2017 In two small Iowa towns, overflow crowds similarly lobbed questions at Republican Senators Charles Grassley and Joni Ernst . \nAbout 18,000 callers participated in a telephone town hall with suburban Chicago Rep. Peter Roskam, who has been criticised for cancelling smaller in-person meetings and declining debates. \nProtesters booed in Montana when Senator Steve Daines rescheduled a speech to state lawmakers for Wednesday. And at a protest town hall in Allentown, Pennsylvania, home of Sen. Pat Toomey, the protest group called Tuesdays with Toomey hung an empty suit in place of the senator. \nSimilarly, a liberal group in Maine is holding its own town halls against GOP Senator Susan Collins. \nAlso Tuesday, the most powerful member of the US Senate faced jeers from nearly 1,000 as he arrived to address a group of local business leaders. In Lawrenceburg, Kentucky, they chanted as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell entered the American Legion Post 34 Fairgrounds in a black limousine. \nIn pictures: Protests, pomp and Donald Trump 30 show all In pictures: Protests, pomp and Donald Trump 1/30 President-elect Donald Trump acknowledges guests as he arrives on the platform at the US Capitol in Washington DC\nGetty Images\n2/30 Donald Trump is sworn in as the 45th president of the United States by Chief Justice John Roberts as Melania Trump looks on during the 58th Presidential Inauguration at the U.S. Capitol in Washington\nAP\n3/30 President Donald Trump shakes hands with Justice John Roberts after taking the oath at inauguration ceremonies swearing in Trump as the 45th president of the United States\nReuters\n4/30 President Donald Trump raises his fists after his inauguration on the West Front of the U.S. Capitol\nGetty\n5/30 U.S. President-elect Donald Trump greets outgoing President Barack Obama before Trump is inaugurated during ceremonies on the Capitol in Washington\nReuters\n6/30 resident-elect Donald Trump arrives on the platform of the US Capitol in Washington DC\nGetty Images\n7/30 Attendees partake in the inauguration ceremonies to swear in Donald Trump as the 45th president of the United States at the U.S. Capitol in Washington DC\nReuters\n8/30 US President Donald Trump delivers his inaugural address during ceremonies at the US Capitol in Washington DC\nGetty\n9/30 U.S. President Donald Trump waves with wife Melania during the Inaugural Parade in Washington DC\nReuters\n10/30 Protesters registered their rage against the new president Friday in a chaotic confrontation with police who used pepper spray and stun grenades in a melee just blocks from Donald Trump's inaugural parade route.

She spoke at the Tennessee town hall about how the Affordable Care Act helped cover her pre-existing condition. \nBlackburn said the plan for efforts to repeal and replace the law includes maintaining coverage of pre-existing conditions and young adults on their parents' plans. \n“Whatever they do, it needs to be affordable for everybody,” Brown said after the Tennessee town hall. “Because even the people that voted for a Republican, they're not going to be very happy if they've been promised they're going to repeal this Affordable Care Act and then they replace it with a garbage policy. They're going to be affected as well.” \nAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:56:57.819+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
