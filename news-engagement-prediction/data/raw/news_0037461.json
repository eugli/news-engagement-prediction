The aid plan, expected within weeks, will build on an 8 per cent instant rebate — equivalent to the provincial portion of the HST — on electricity bills that kicked in on Jan. 1.\n“That actually isn’t enough,” Wynne told reporters Wednesday before cabinet ministers heard detailed proposals from Energy Minister Glen Thibeault behind closed doors.\n“The reality is that there has been an increase in everyone’s electricity bills, but there are some people who are carrying a disproportionate burden ,” she added.\nThibeault said options include moving some costs of the electricity system from homeowners and businesses through their hydro rates to the broader base of taxpayers, sharing the load more widely. \n  He would not estimate how much more Ontarians could save on their electricity bills, saying it depends on what elements the government chooses. \nThey include helping rural and northern residents in extreme cases where remote delivery charges for electricity are punishing, but not a general scenario where urban residents with relatively cheaper delivery costs subsidize all rural residents, sources have said.\nThibeault signalled the government is prepared to go beyond the $1 billion a year it is spending on the instant HST rebates for electricity. Remote rural residents are also getting as much as 20 per cent off their hydro costs under a program that also took effect in January. \n“I get that we need to take it to the next level to actually help people with their bills,” Thibeault said.\n“We’re working as quickly as we can on this,” he added, warning some measures may require legislation that takes time for MPPs to pass. Others could be done faster by regulation.\nThe government, which is struggling in public opinion polls, faces a provincial election in 17 months. Hydro costs are often higher in rural and northern areas because they don’t have natural gas service for cheaper home heating, and rely on electric baseboards or electric furnaces. \nWhile Ontarians await the hydro relief, the Progressive Conservatives slammed the government for not passing a law banning local utilities from disconnecting homes for nonpayment of bills until spring.\n“One is one too many in the dead of winter,” said Tory MPP John Yakabuski (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke), who did not have any statistics on disconnects this winter and called on Thibeault to issue a ministerial directive banning the practice. \nThibeault said he does not have the authority to issue such an order under the Electricity Act, passed by the Progressive Conservative government of Mike Harris in 1998.\nHydro One announced last year it would not disconnect any customers this winter and some utilities have shied away from disconnects because of the pending bill, which returns to the Legislature for final debate Feb. 28.\nThe Ontario Energy Board said it is still gathering numbers on disconnections.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:58:55.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
