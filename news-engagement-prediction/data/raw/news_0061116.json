The beachside town is 98km from Melbourne, while Melton is only 50km from the CBD. \nMr Languiller on Thursday said he would repay more than $37,000 he claimed from the public purse before today releasing a statement saying that was \"not enough\". \nHe had claimed the second residence allowance for living in the upmarket seaside town of Queenscliff despite his electorate of Tarneit being just 30km from the city. \nHe lived in the rental home on the Bellarine Peninsula, about 100km from Melbourne, for most of 2016. He now lives primarily in Footscray, which is also outside his electorate. \n\"No matter what difficult personal circumstances I may have been going through, I have to recognise it as an error of judgement and I accept that I should pay the price for that error of judgement,\" he wrote. \nHe also thanked Premier Daniel Andrews for his support over the last two years as he faced family challenges. \n\"I regret that this issue, if not addressed, could damage the position of Speaker and the Labor Party that I love,\" he added. \nBoth MPs will return to the backbench. Candidates to replace the roles of Speaker and Deputy Speaker will be nominated at the next caucus meeting. \nWith AAP.
