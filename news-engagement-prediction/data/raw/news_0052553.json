These are part of our heritage, our culture,” Kermani said while speaking to The Express Tribune. “We also wanted to convey resistance to extremism, fanaticism and terrorism.” \nThe artist intended to perform ‘dhamaal’, the ecstatic spiritual dance which the saint used to perform in his life. Dhamaal is played on the beat of the naghara – a percussion instrument, and scheduled after Maghrib prayer. Sheema Kermani performing Dhamaal at Sehwan Sharif.
