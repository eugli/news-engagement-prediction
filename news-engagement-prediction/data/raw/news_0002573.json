Now, one mom is speaking out about the impact with a powerful photo. \nJennifer Kolsano took to Facebook to explain that a group of people in her Chicago neighborhood volunteered to help sponsor and bring a Syrian refugee family to the US. However, following Trump's ban, they found out the family was no longer able to enter the country. \n\"For those who have asked, we just received news that the refugee family we and several other neighbors were sponsoring will be forbidden from arriving on Monday due to the latest executive order,\" she wrote on Facebook. \"Today Trump said he signed this action to keep out terrorists and to keep our country and our military safe. He has chosen to do that by barring an accountant, a literature major, and toddler from being reunited with their brothers, sister, parents, and grandparents after a two-year vetting process because of their country of origin and their religion.\" ADVERTISEMENT \nJennifer posted her story alongside a heartbreaking photo of an empty crib that the group had bought for the family's little girl. She and her neighbors had volunteered through the Refugee One organization , which Jennifer said had organized for 15 families to arrive at the Chicago airport over the next three weeks prior to Trump's ban. \nIn her post, she mentioned how ironic it was that Trump signed the executive order on Friday, Jan. 27, which is Holocaust Remembrance Day. \n\"And he has chosen to do that on a symbolic day on which we remember millions who died because of their religion,\" she wrote about Trump's horrifying ban. \"Today will be remembered as one of the great moral failings of our nation just as our refusal to take in Jewish refugees during the holocaust.\" \nThe photo of the empty crib, which has since gone viral, shows how the ban is effecting innocent children all over the world, and Jennifer's final words encompass deep emotions regarding the current state of our democracy: \"This order is fundamentally immoral and un-American and I am deeply ashamed of our government. And so so very sad for a young family fleeing war that we had just begun to know.\" Related:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T00:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:29:43.788+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
