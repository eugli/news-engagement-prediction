This Tex-Mex favorite — inspired by the beef tacos I grew up on — may be a far cry from saucy carnitas and queso fresco , but that doesn't mean there's not room in the taco world for them to coexist! \nThe best part of the recipe? You'll be able to get these tacos on the table before you have time to say \"giddyup.\" Just prep all the ingredients, and let diners customize and stuff their tacos to their liking at the table. \nI made these in the style they're served at some of my favorite Tex-Mex restaurants — stuffed over the brim with lettuce and tomatoes. Care for more flavor? Add in some guacamole or salsa. I've even been known to drizzle (or more like drown) queso dip over these bad boys. \nForks will be required to scoop up the falling fillings, y'all. Get ready to dig into these Tex-Mex tacos.
