He never played more than 14 minutes in a single game. He never grabbed more than three rebounds or made more than three shots from the field. \nThen there was the three-game suspension for an undisclosed violation of team rules that started in the Maui Invitational and followed him back to Knoxville. \nThen, all of a sudden, Schofield became unforgettable after exploding with 18 points and 10 rebounds in a Jan. 7 loss at No. 13 Florida. (Photo: Tennessee athletics, UTSports.com) \nSince the trip to Gainesville, the versatile sophomore forward, listed at 6-foot-4, 238 pounds, has averaged 11.4 points, 4.9 rebounds and 22.5 minutes per game, scoring 15 or more points five times in his last 13 games, including 17 points in Tennessee's last two games. \n\"I think Admiral is really starting to figure this out,\" Tennessee coach Rick Barnes said on Monday. \n(Want the latest scoop on Tennessee football and basketball?

As a young player, you come in thinking scoring is the way and the outlet to successes here. \n\"The biggest thing for me, I just wanted to play well.\" \nBut his intensity as a competitor was working against him. He was competitive to a fault. \n\"I would let that competitiveness get in the way of me listening to everything that coach was saying,\" Schofield said. \"I'm a good listener and I'll learn fast, it's just that sometimes when I was in the heat of the moment, when I was competing, I didn't that get key detail that would separate me from everyone else.\" \nSchofield's season averages have climbed to 8.1 points and 4.0 rebounds in 17.6 minutes per game. He's scoring efficiently, too, making 50.0 percent (65-130) of his shots from the field and 44.1 percent (15-34) from the 3-point line. \n\"The biggest thing now is I'm just listening,\" Schofield said, \"taking in everything no matter how (Barnes is) saying it or what he's saying. \n\"I just know that everything Coach Barnes is trying to give me is really benefitting me in the end.\" (Photo: Randy Sartin, USA TODAY Sports) \nSchofield started 22 times in 32 games as a freshman last season, averaging 7.6 points, 4.0 rebounds and 18.7 minutes per game. He's excelled in his role coming off the bench this season, starting just once in 23 games. \n\"People like Kyle Alexander , Grant Williams , they set the tone for how the game is going to be played,\" Schofield said of his fellow forwards. \"When they don't do that, my role is to come in and reset that tone. \n\"When you're on the bench you can study the game and understand how the game is being played -- what's the flow of the game, what's needed when you get in. You need to rebound or you need a low-post presence scoring the ball. It's really beneficial, coming off the bench and seeing how the game is flowing.\" \nTo better his team's flow once he checks in, Schofield knows he needs to play physical in the paint and rebound the basketball, then use his versatility to score when the offense comes to him. \n\"Scoring the ball when I get a chance to finish at the basket,\" Schofield said. \"Then being able to stretch the defense a little bit, knocking down threes and jump shots, things of that nature.\" \n\"I'm just playing within my role, taking shots that I work on everyday.\" \n(Buy one month of GoVols247 VIP access and GET TWO MONTHS FREE .)
