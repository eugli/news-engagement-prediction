But Adam Gorlitsky seemed to draw the most. \nIt’s apparent the watchers were impressed with Gorlitsky for what he was accomplishing. \nHe didn’t win, not even close. And he wasn’t going that fast. But when you’re paralyzed any step is worth cheering for. \nGorlitsky became paralyzed in 2005. \n“I fell asleep at the wheel for a few seconds and my life literally changed in a blink of an eye,” he says. \nHe’s been in a wheelchair ever since. About a year ago that changed. \n“I always held out hope. Little did I know I’d be walking in a very different way,” Gorlitsky says. \nHe can’t feel his legs. And despite appearing like he’s walking, the machine he is wearing is doing most of the work. \nHe’s walking with the aid of a Re-Walk Robotic Exoskeleton. \n“I describe it like the lower half of a Terminator suit,” Gorlitsky quips. \nWhen set to walk, he moves his arms, pushes his hips forward and the suit, in turn, moves his legs. \n“It’s a different kind of feeling when you’re walking but you’re not feeling the ground,” he says. \nAnd the entire thing is harder than it looks. \n“It’s a great core workout — my abs are just completely destroyed right now,” Gorlitsky says. \nHe says he’s punishing himself to help raise awareness and raise money for his foundation, “I Got Legs.” \nThe group helps other with paralysis walk again, too. \nThe Exoskeleton costs about $80,000 and insurance doesn’t cover them. \n“We are fighting for the right to walk,” he says, for himself and others who yearn to walk again. \nGorlitsky walked for five hours, completing the last five miles of the race. \nHe has vowed to walk a million steps in races all over the country and raise $1 million. \nBut today was mostly about personal achievement. \n“Just to be walking across the finish line with everybody it’s an amazing feeling,” Gorlitsky says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T09:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T10:55:21.331+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
