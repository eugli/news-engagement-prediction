It’s a fine idea in the minors. It would be a disaster in the majors. Rec Photo by Ezra Shaw/Getty Images There are two kinds of baseball games in this world. The first kind is the baseball game that you sort of care about, a little bit, kind of, because it’s fun. Examples include the MLB All-Star Game and the World Baseball Classic. Maybe you really, really care about those games, and bless you for that. But there are millions who enjoy them without being overly invested. Then there are the baseball games that you watch intently, start to finish, all three hours, inhaling the negative space between each pitch and releasing it in a pillar of flame. These are the games that define seasons and careers. Bad teams can throw no-hitters. Great teams can win championships. You care about these games. Also, there are the boring games during the regular season that you forget about by the next day. Three kinds of baseball games. There are three kinds of baseball games in this world. And maybe a few others that I’m forgetting. But focus on that first set of games for now. These are the prestige games. They’re an unholy hybrid between spring training and the World Series, which makes you indifferent and interested at the same time. You know why the World Baseball Classic and All-Star Games are supposed to be fun — The best players! The attention! — and you know why you don’t care as much. Now the other games. You watch because you know there’s a payoff waiting. Maybe not in every game, but eventually. There’s going to be a long home run at the perfect time, a walk-off win that ends with your sports heroes acting like morons at home plate, a strikeout that releases every last bit of tension in your spine. When baseball messes with the rules to the All-Star Game or World Baseball Classic, the proper response is “eh.” There might be some grumbling. I know I’ve made plenty of “This Time It Counts!” jokes. But, honestly, it’s hard to care. These are fun games, but if you had to give one set of games up — you can have the WBC or the regular season, but not both — you wouldn’t take two seconds to come up with an answer. That’s why the rules can change for the WBC, and a day can go by without the world noticing. From a WBC press release on Tuesday: Extra Innings: For any inning beginning with the 11th inning, the Federation Team at-bat shall begin the inning with runners on first and second base. The batter who leads off an inning shall continue to be the batter who would lead off the inning in the absence of this extra-innings rule. The runner on first base shall be the player (or a substitute for such player) in the batting order immediately preceding the batter who leads off the inning. The runner on second base shall be the player (or a substitute for such player) in the batting order immediately preceding the runner on first base. OK. This makes sense. The rosters are filled with players in whom professional sports teams that have invested millions of dollars and billions of yen. The games are fun, and national pride is super, but no one wants to see an ace pitcher throwing six innings in relief on two-day’s rest because the bullpen was mismanaged and the alternative is to forfeit. No one wants to see a catcher squatting for 18 innings because the alternative is to play a position player back there and risk injury. And, perhaps most importantly, I’m not sure how many people are going to be riveted to the TV after 10 innings of exhibition-serious baseball. I’m more than OK with this. This, from Yahoo! on Wednesday , makes a similar amount of sense: Major League Baseball plans on testing a rule change in the lowest levels of the minor leagues this season that automatically would place a runner on second base at the start of extra innings, a distinct break from the game’s orthodoxy that nonetheless has wide-ranging support at the highest levels of the league, sources familiar with the plan told Yahoo! Sports. Rookie-level baseball games fall into the category of exhibition-serious, with fans who care and care an awful lot, but fans who understand the business concerns. There are reasons to avoid having a team filled with teenagers play 18-inning games in the GCL. Very good reasons. This is a-OK. MLB’s desire to test it in the rookie-level Gulf Coast League and Arizona League this summer is part of an effort to understand its wide in-game consequences — and whether its implementation at higher levels, and even the major leagues, may be warranted. You monsters. The whole country is a rejected Final Fantasy plot right now, and you drop this in our laps? You absolute monsters. If that change were implemented in the majors, it would cut to the core of those other games, the ones that define your affection for the sport. It would be an absolute travesty.
