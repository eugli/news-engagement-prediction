She believes he went over to help.\nPolice have ruled out foul play.\n“I call Vince a sweetheart,” said Alfie Burt, Rigby’s friend. “He was a super guy. He was a good friend and he was dedicated to anything that would serve veterans.”\nRigby became a staple among veterans after he vocally protested the Conservative government’s plan to close the local Veterans Affairs office.\n“Vince was a good part of our team and to lose him is rather devastating,” said veteran advocate Ron Clarke.\nLast November, Rigby was seen next to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to celebrate the reopening of the Sydney Veterans Affairs office.\nRigby never hid the fact that he lived with PTSD. His physical and mental scars from his tour in Bosnia forced him into retirement several years ago.\n“He had a lot of difficulties, probably a lot more than he was really aware of in the beginning,” said Burt. “His wife Sandra said he wasn't the same guy when he came back.”\nThe cause of death is still being determined.\n“I'm going to miss him,” said Burt. “Really going to miss him.”\nWith files from CTV Atlantic’s Kyle Moore. \nRelated Stories New facility in Sydney aims to fill void left by Veterans Affairs office closure Veterans credit red tide to ABC movement Veterans rally in Sydney over veteran affairs office closing Photos Vince Rigby has been identified as the victim of a fire at a duplex in Whitney Pier, N.S.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T13:08:21.828+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
