That's not the case,\" Mahoney said. \"I feel for refugees. I don't want to see people suffer, but we have to take care of our country first. \n\"One of (Trump's) promises was to protect our country, to make it safer, and in doing so, we need a better vetting process, and that takes time,\" she said. \nHarry O'Neal, the son of an Air Force veteran, said he worries about his family and his country, and he's not surprised more people support the travel ban than oppose it. \n\"The other countries said that they were going to send in ISIS to infiltrate the people coming in (as refugees or U.S. immigrants),\" O'Neal said. \"There's no way you can prevent them coming in if you don't have some type of border security.\" \nStill, Sheri Henry said she struggles over whether the president's hard-line immigration stance is the right one. \n\"I voted for him, and I think we can only go forward, but I think it's interesting as far as the immigrant situation because we're for, America's for everybody,\" Henry said. \nJeff Sullivan said he sees the protests but argues that those waving signs aren't giving Trump a chance. \n\"This is just a temporary thing he's putting in place to make sure the people are vetted and secure enough to enter the country without causing harm to American citizens,\" Sullivan said.
