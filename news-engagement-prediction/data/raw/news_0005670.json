(Photo: Matt Kryger/IndyStar) \nTen years ago today, the Indianapolis Colts won in a Super Bowl of superlatives — starting with the weather and ending with firsts for a coach, a quarterback, a city. With Super Bowl 51 looming Sunday, here’s a look back at our triumph. \nSoup bowl. This was a Miami Super Bowl. Should have been beautiful, right? Instead, it was the wettest — the first Super Bowl played almost entirely in the rain, in conditions seemingly fit for neither Manning nor beast. By halftime, the Colts and Chicago Bears had combined for six first-half turnovers, including five fumbles. Colts offensive coordinator Tom Moore took it in stride. “Sometimes it rains, sometimes it snows, sometimes the sun shines,” he said. “That’s football.” \nTony Dungy . The Colts’ quiet leader became the first black coach to raise the Lombardi Trophy in victory. “As it was once written of Joe Louis, he is a credit to his race — the human race,” IndyStar’s Bob Kravitz wrote. “He not only shattered a racial barrier, but he proved that yes, hallelujah yes, good guys can still finish first, even in a sport as tough and brutal as professional football.” \nDestiny. For many Colts, the hurdle was cleared when they defeated the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship. “We were unstoppable at that point,” Dwight Freeney said. “Once we beat them, we didn’t care who we faced. We got the Bears. We didn’t care. We said, ‘Good luck trying to stop us.’” When Bears’ return man Devin Hester ran the opening kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown, Colts fans were dismayed, the players unfazed. The players were right. The bottom line: Indianapolis Colts 29, Chicago Bears 17. \nPrince. The singer and showman put on one of the greatest Super Bowl halftime shows ever. Billboard ranks it No. 1; Sports Illustrated No. 2 (behind U2 in 2002). Prince played “1999,” “Let’s Go Crazy,” “Proud Mary,” and “All Along the Watchtower.” But, Billboard wrote, “the explosive coda was ‘Purple Rain,’ which had the stadium full of testosterone-pumped football fanatics waving their arms and howling in falsetto.” Facebook A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

After years of enduring criticism that he couldn’t win the big game, Manning silenced his critics. It wasn’t a vintage Manning performance — 25-of-38, 247 yards, 1 touchdown, 1 interception — but Manning brought Indianapolis its first Super Bowl title. “(He’s) done it,” Dungy said. “He’s got that behind him. I don’t think there’s anything you can say now other than this guy is a Hall-of-Fame player, one of the greatest players to ever play the game.\" \nSTORIES AND PHOTOS THAT MIGHT INTEREST YOU:   Indianapolis Colts fans and former teammates cheer on Peyton Manning (18) during the 10th anniversary reunion of their Super Bowl XLVI win during halftime of the Colts game Sunday, November 20, 206, afternoon at Lucas Oil Stadium Matt_Kryger/Indy_Star Peyton Manning takes the field during the Colts Super Bowl XLI 10th Anniversary reunion during halftime of the Colts/Titans game Sunday, November 20, 206, afternoon at Lucas Oil Stadium.
