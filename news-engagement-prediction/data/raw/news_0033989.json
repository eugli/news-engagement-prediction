Blake Lively Masters the Fashion Week Wardrobe Switch February 15, 2017 11:12 PM by Maria Ward Photo: AKM-GSI Blake Lively is one to watch at New York Fashion Week . The actress is a fixture on the front row at multiple big-ticket shows. When two of her known favorites fell on the same day, the actress took the back-to-back calendar events in her stride, courtesy of a well-timed wardrobe quick-change. After Lively brought a touch of romance to Michael Kors in a feminine floral-print frock, she followed it up with monochromatic black-and-white motifs en route to Marchesa. It wouldn’t be the first time we’ve seen Lively perform a switch in record time. When she stepped out to promote her film Age of Adaline in 2015, Lively churned out three different outfits in less than 24 hours. Inspiring a similar double-take reaction today, Lively raised the bar with her artful blend of contrasting yet complementary mixed prints. A houndstooth-patterned topper could have felt a tad too retro all on its own, so Lively made it modern by layering the piece over a fur coat in a contemporary print. With checks and stripes fully covered, Lively threw in a polka-dot print for good measure on a trumpet-flare skirt and capped things off with a flirty midriff-baring top. She left her standard black stilettos at home, and stepped out in a pointed-toe pump in stark white instead.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T06:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T04:04:29.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
