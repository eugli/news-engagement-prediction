Close share panel Media caption Tom Watson: \"We have to do better, we cannot sustain this level of distance from our electorate.\" Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson has said now is \"not the time\" to change the party's leadership, but it must \"do better\" at winning over voters. \nSpeaking at the Scottish Labour conference in Perth, he said the party's by-election loss in Copeland had been \"hugely disappointing\". \nJeremy Corbyn has said he will stay on as Labour leader, after the party won a separate by-election in Stoke Central. \nDavid Miliband has said Labour is at its weakest point in half a century. \nThe former foreign secretary, who lost out on the Labour leadership in 2010, told the Times that he was \"deeply concerned\" about the party's future. \nMr Watson said he would not seek to \"sugar coat\" the loss in Copeland. \nThe Conservatives won the Cumbrian seat in the first by-election gain by a sitting government in 35 years. Tories in historic by-election Copeland win \nMr Watson told delegates: \"All of us with leadership roles in the Labour Party need to have a long hard look at ourselves at what's not working. \n\"I have said it a lot recently - this is not the time for a leadership election, that issue was settled last year.\" Image copyright Reuters Image caption David Miliband declined to rule out a return to UK politics \nMr Miliband, who now works as the head of the International Rescue Committee in New York, said: \"I don't think this is just a repeat of the 1980s. \n\"We have to really understand the historic nature of the challenge that we have to face.\" \nBut when asked if he would come back to politics, he said: \"I honestly don't know what I am going to do. It's hard to see - but what's the point of saying never?\" \nBBC political correspondent Chris Mason said some in Labour saw Mr Miliband as the best leader they never had, but it was not the first time he had been \"a public doom-monger\" about his party under Mr Corbyn. 'Disastrous' loss \nLabour had held the seat in Copeland for 80 years. PM Theresa May said the \"astounding\" victory there showed her government was \"working for everyone\". \nTrudy Harrison got 44.3% of the vote, increasing the Conservatives' vote share by more than 8%. She overturned a Labour majority of more than 2,564 to take the seat by 2,147 votes - a swing of more than 6%. \nThe leader of trade union Unison, Dave Prentis, told the Guardian that the loss was \"disastrous\". \n\"The blame for these results does not lie solely with Jeremy Corbyn, but he must take responsibility for what happens next,\" he said. \n\"Nurses, teaching assistants, care workers and ordinary people everywhere need a Labour government. Jeremy has to show he understands how to turn things around and deliver just that.\" \nGerard Coyne, who is standing to become general secretary of the Unite union, said there was \"no doubt\" Copeland was a \"meltdown\" for Labour. \nLabour must \"face up\" to the \"disconnect\" between Westminster and ordinary Labour voters, he said. \nBut he stopped short of calling on Mr Corbyn to step down, saying it was a matter for the party and its MPs. 'Solutions' not leadership \nShadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer told the Guardian he was concerned the party was not \"acknowledging how bad a result it was\". \nBut shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry defended the party, telling the BBC: \"What makes a difference to people's lives is having the sort of government that will address the concerns of people, that has some solutions.\" \nThe opposition's challenge \"cannot be laid at the door of one individual\", she said. Media caption Theresa May greets new Copeland MP \nMr Corbyn said Labour's \"message was not enough to win through in Copeland\" but he hailed victory in Stoke as a \"decisive rejection of UKIP's politics of division and dishonesty\". \nLabour's share of the vote for newly elected MP Gareth Snell was 37% - slightly down on the 39.3% it got in 2015. \nUKIP got 24.7% of the vote and the Conservatives, who came a close third, 24.4% - both slightly higher than their 2015 vote share. \nLabour had held both Stoke and Copeland since their creation but was forced to defend them when two former frontbenchers, Tristram Hunt and Jamie Reed, resigned as MPs. \nThe by-election results mean the government's majority is now 12 - the same as it was immediately after the general election, as the Conservative's new Copeland seat makes up for the one they lost to the Lib Dems in the Richmond Park by-election. \nWith Sinn Fein's four MPs not taking their seats, Mrs May's working majority is 16.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T20:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T16:03:51.403+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
