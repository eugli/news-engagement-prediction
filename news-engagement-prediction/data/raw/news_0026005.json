(CFIA)\nLast August, the first case of whirling disease was confirmed in Banff's Johnson Lake. Since then, cases of the disease have been detected at a number of additional locations in the Bow River in southern Alberta.\nThe spread of the disease has led to quarantines for commercial fish operations and wreaked havoc on owners who make a living cultivating fish.\nThe CFIA says its declaration does not currently affect fishing in the Bow River, and that there are no health concerns for people who use the bodies of water that contain whirling disease — or for those who eat fish that have contracted the disease.\nThere is no treatment available for whirling disease. Rather, the CFIA says it is focused on containment and prevention.\nMORE ALBERTA NEWS | Notley highlights strategies to improve Alberta-U.S. trade MORE ALBERTA NEWS | Charges laid after Pincher Creek emergency situation that shut town to the public", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T22:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:28:33.617+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
