Many state governors go in and out of the country, some for a month or two, some for three months without anybody asking any question and without any handover to their deputies. \n“But I am saying that with what we are going through now, we must come to appreciate that if you are going into public office, you have no secrecy,” he said. \nHe said that since the Presidency started on a good note by informing the nation of the treatment of an ear infection last time, more information this time around would remove speculations and erase any form of rumour. \n“It is our duty and right and the President took cognizance of that last year when he disclosed to Nigerians what he was going abroad for. This year should not be an exception. \n“This is what has given room to a lot of rumours and speculation which are totally uncalled for,” he said.
