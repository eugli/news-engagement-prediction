Police say the man had a dark goatee and wore a beanie cap and a hooded sweatshirt. \nRead more: MSU president Simon: 'No culture of tolerance of sexual assault' \nThe girl fled to a nearby friend's house when the man asked her to get into his vehicle, which was last seen in the area of Cherry Hill and Denton roads. \nDetective Sgt.
