Organizers said the signs were created to make a statement. (credit: CBS) \nThe signs have the message “Hate Has No Home Here” printed across them, in six different languages. \n“Hate has no home in America,” said Frank Anell, Executive Director of Project Worth More. “[The signs are] saying we will not stand for this in America, that is not what America is founded on.” Frank Anell (credit: CBS) \nProject Worth More is a foundation based in Aurora. The foundation aids refugees who recently moved to the Denver metro area. \nThe signs handed out on Sunday were given upon a donation from the public. Proceeds were given to the foundation. \nThose who picked up signs said recent executive orders by President Trump concerned them. \n“Over the last three weeks, things have gotten really busy since the initial executive order was signed,” Anell said. \n“I have two little boys, and I am distressed by what I am hearing in the news, and from the president,” said Katie Walsh, a local who took a sign. Emily Pugliese (credit: CBS) \nEmily Pugliese, the woman who wanted to bring the sign movement to Denver, decided the signs could create a conversation in Denver. \n“Right now, these signs are just words,” Pugliese said. ”I am hoping that the action will continue forward after all the signs are out in people’s yards, to fight against the hate.” \nBy doing putting signs outside, those who made them said Denver could better serve as an inclusive city for all. \n“I think that our country was founded on immigrants, and founded on people who are different. We need to maintain that if we are going to maintain the beauty of this country,” Pugliese said. \nDillon Thomas is a reporter at CBS4 and a Colorado native.
