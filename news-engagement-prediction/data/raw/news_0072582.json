We have to move around a lot, and it’s tiring, but when I look at the beautiful scenery on screen, it’s all worth it.” \nThese are the words of actor Kim Sang Joong who plays Amogae in MBC’s “ Rebel: Thief Who Stole the People .” The drama began filming last year on November 28 and filmed at sites in over seven areas in Korea, resulting in a total of 15000 kilometers traveled by the staff and cast. To give you an idea of how far that is, in 15000 kilometers, you can go from Seoul to Tokyo ten times, and it’s even enough to travel from Seoul to New York. The image below indicates the areas they visited to film each scene. \nThe magnificent view that unfolds in the drama is all a result of the efforts of the staff, who made a trip around Korea three times to find the right places to film at. Main producer Namgoong Sung Woo explained, “In a historical drama, nice scenery is a crucial factor in determining quality. We are on such a rigorous schedule that sometimes we don’t even have time to do our laundries, but we are able to continue on thanks to the positive reviews we are getting.” \nThe actors’ schedules are equally hectic. Yoon Kyun Sang filmed at Hwangmae Mountain on December 28 and 29 and moved back to Seoul for a script read-through on December 30. He then traveled to Yongin on January 1 to resume filming. \nEven on New Year’s Day, all of the staff and cast members were busy filming, and it’s thanks to their hard work that we’re able to get a look at the stunning scenery from various corners of Korea. \nWatch the latest episode of “Rebel: Thief Who Stole the People” below!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T13:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T10:07:49.647+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
