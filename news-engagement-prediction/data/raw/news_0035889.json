McFarland is a former Fox News analyst. Read more US President Donald Trump bashes news media, denies turmoil in White House \nHarward would have replaced retired Gen. Michael Flynn, who resigned at Trump’s request on Monday after revelations that he misled vice-president Mike Pence about discussing sanctions with Russia’s ambassador to the US during the transition. Trump said in a news conference on Thursday that he was disappointed by how Flynn had treated Pence, but did not believe Flynn had done anything wrong by having the conversations. \nHarward, a former Navy SEAL, served as deputy commander of US Central Command under Gen. James Mattis, who is now defense secretary. Harward served on the NSC under President George W Bush and commissioned the National Counter Terrorism Center. \nUpon retirement in 2013 after a nearly 40-year career in the Navy, Harward became chief executive officer for defense and aerospace giant Lockheed Martin in the United Arab Emirates. Trump has recently been in very public negotiations with Lockheed over the cost of its F-35 fighter jet. \nOfficials said earlier this week that there were two other contenders in the running for the job: acting national security adviser Keith Kellogg and retired Gen. David Petraeus. \nPetraeus, a retired four-star general, resigned as CIA director in 2012 and pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified information relating to documents he had provided to his biographer, with whom he was having an affair. \nHe was also fined $100,000 and remains on probation. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T16:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T20:44:43.816+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
