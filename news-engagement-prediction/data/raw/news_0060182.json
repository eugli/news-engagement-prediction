S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to issue warning letters to specific dietary supplement manufacturers stating that ostarine is an unapproved new drug and that selling the drug is in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA).” \nWhen the doping violation was first announced last year, Lawlor denied knowingly taking any banned substances but now he’s been suspended for two years as a result. \nLawlor hasn’t fought in the UFC since March 2016 when he lost a unanimous decision to Corey Anderson. \nWhile on hiatus from mixed martial arts, Lawlor has recently ventured into professional wrestling where is set to make his debut on Saturday night in Las Vegas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T05:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:46:58.695+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
