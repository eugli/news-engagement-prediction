But she was wrong. \nYesterday the Harvard Gazette , the university's newspaper, named her the 2017 Harvard University Humanitarian of the Year. This prestigious honor has previously been given to many \"public-spirited leaders\" such as James Earl Jones and Malala Yousafzai. \nA post shared by badgalriri (@badgalriri) on Oct 1, 2016 at 1:06pm PDT \nHarvard Foundation Director S. Allen Counter explained why Riri was chosen for this honor, citing some of her humanitarian moments like building \"a state-of-the-art center for oncology and nuclear medicine to diagnose and treat breast cancer at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Bridgetown, Barbados\" and setting up a scholarship program for for students attending college in the U.S. from Caribbean countries.

Gomes Humanitarian Award. \nCongrats, Riri! Keep up all the good work, work, work, work, work.
