Buehrle will be the 12th player to have his number retired by the White Sox. He played alongside two others: Frank Thomas and Paul Konerko. \n\"A standout on the field and a standup teammate in the clubhouse, it is our honor to retire Mark Buehrle's No. 56 and to welcome him into the legendary class of all-time White Sox greats,\" White Sox chairman Jerry Reinsdorf said. \"Mark Buehrle is one of the most accomplished pitchers in franchise history.\" \nDrafted by Chicago in the 38th round out of Jefferson College in Missouri in 1998, Buehrle was unlikely to become a big leaguer, never mind a franchise great. But he accelerated through Chicago's Minor League system and debuted with the White Sox as a reliever in 2000. \nThe southpaw earned a place in the rotation the next season and didn't leave it for 11 seasons, becoming both the team ace and one of the most durable pitchers of his era. Buehrle, who was known for his deceiving repertoire and rapid pitching pace, made at least 30 starts in each of the next 15 seasons. He completed at least 200 innings in each of those seasons except his last, in 2015, when he threw 198 innings for the Blue Jays. \nBuehrle was 161-119 with a 3.83 ERA for the White Sox from 2000-2011. He became a model of consistency, leading the American League in starts and innings pitched twice. He ranks among the top 10 in franchise history in wins, starts, innings and strikeouts. He earned double-digit victories in each of his 15 seasons as a starting pitcher. Buehrle went 1-1 with a 3.47 ERA in four appearances during the White Sox's 2005 World Series run, tossing the first of four consecutive Sox complete games in Game 2 of the AL Championship Series vs. the Angels and securing the save in the 14th inning of Game 3 of the World Series at Houston. \nBuehrle threw a no-hitter against the Texas Rangers in 2007 and a perfect game against the Tampa Bay Rays in 2009. He retired with a 214-160 record and 3.81 ERA over 518 appearances (493 starts) for three teams over 16 seasons. \n\"Mark carried himself with class and professionalism throughout his career, and his popularity with staff, teammates and Sox fans is very well deserved,\" Reinsdorf said. \"Although a very humble person, he certainly showed a flair for the dramatic on the mound.\" is a reporter for MLB.com based in New York.
