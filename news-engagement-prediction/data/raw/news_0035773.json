Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images Yesterday’s confirmation hearing for David Friedman, Trump’s choice to become ambassador to Israel, in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was expected to be a wild and woolly affair. And it was , with the proceedings interrup\nted by various and sundry protesters, Palestinians and Jews, who expressed unhappiness toward Friedman’s famously vociferous views on Middle East affairs and those who disagree with them. Said views were also the focus of senatorial questioning of the bankruptcy lawyer turned would-be diplomat:\nNew Mexico Sen. Tom Udall detailed many of the insults Friedman had hurled in print before being selected for the ambassadorial role.\n“He has insulted and denigrated members of the Senate,” Udall said. He Quote: d Friedman’s comment about senior Democratic New York Sen. Charles Schumer, after Democratic colleagues voted to approve the Iran nuclear deal, that “Schumer is validating the worst appeasement of terrorism since Munich,” where Palestinian terrorists killed Israeli athletes at the Olympic Games.\nUdall also said that Friedman had “slandered” President Barack Obama when he described “the blatant anti-Semitism emanating from our president and his sycophantic minions.”\nAnd he pointed out that Friedman once said of the Anti-Defamation League that “frankly, they sound like morons.” And those were not even the worst of Friedman’s slurs. The worst would probably be his description of American Jews who oppose his right-wing positions on Israeli-Palestinian affairs as “worse than kapos — Jews who turned in their fellow Jews in the Nazi death camps.”\nNow Friedman wants senators to disregard all those words because after all they were uttered in the heat of a presidential campaign:\nSome of the language that I used during the highly charged presidential campaign that ended last November has come in for criticism and rightfully so. While I maintain profound differences of opinion with some of my critics, I regret the use of such language. Actually, his extremist views predated the presidential campaign, and as the Israeli newspaper Haaretz pointed out, the attacks on liberal Jews continued well after the election. But it is interesting to note that this line of defense is becoming common for the Trump administration. Just yesterday, the Justice Department (in a brief filed with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals notifying judges the administration would release a new travel ban order next week) argued strenuously against judicial consideration of Trump’s talk about banning Muslims on the campaign trail in interpreting his actions as president. Candidate Trump was just a “private citizen” who was exercising his First Amendment rights to express what sure sounded like religious bigotry. Presumably Friedman’s profanation of the Holocaust and scurrilous attacks on Americans and Israelis alike would fall under the same exemption for campaign demagoguery.\nWhile Friedman had plenty of time to prepare his “so sorry about the demagoguery” defense, he had to be more nimble in dealing with the fallout from Trump’s strange remarks during his press conference earlier this week with Bibi Netanyahu. As you may recall, Trump seemed to express shrugging indifference to the central question of pursuing a one-state or two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Friedman retracted his prior violent opposition to the two-state solution that has been the cornerstone of U.S. policy for decades, but wisely hedged his bets. Who knows what Trump really meant, or what he will say next on this topic?\nBut even though Trump complicated his intended envoy’s confirmation hearing with his latest comments, he more than made up for it by completely diverting attention from the Friedman event with his own 80-minute press conference. Who’s going to watch a sideshow when the Greatest Show on Earth is underway just across town?\nTags: david friedman donald trump israel two-state solution campaign rhetoric Friedman Relies on the ‘I Was Just Demagoguing’ Defense Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories More White House Chaos Over Anti-Immigrant Policy Draft Paul Ryan’s Dream of Tax Cuts for the Rich Will Not Be Denied Andrew Sullivan: The White House Mole Most Viewed Stories The White House Mole Psychologists Think They Found the Purpose of Depression Jared Kushner Takes Trump’s Complaints About CNN to Time Warner Executive Former Obama White House Photographer’s Instagram Is a Master Class in Shade Trump Ends the Presidential Press Conference As We Know It Why Your Dog’s Personality Is a Lot Like Yours Donald Trump Thinks He’s Good at Being President Melania Trump Is Reportedly ‘Miserable’ in Her Role As First Lady The Great Wall Is Wonderfully Ridiculous Trump Somehow Found a Way to Insult Women at the Unveiling of an Airplane Most Popular Video On Daily Intelligencer The Wildest Moments From Donald Trump’s Press Conference Latest News from Daily Intelligencer 17 mins ago Upper East Side Parents Are the Latest Trump Resisters An elite boarding school allegedly had to cancel a field trip to the Central Park’s Trump-affiliated Wollman Rink.\n4:10 p.m. More White House Chaos Over Anti-Immigrant Policy Draft The Associated Press has a draft of a memo that suggests deploying as many as 100,000 National Guard troops.\n3:19 p.m. Senate Confirms Leading Opponent of Environmental Regulation As Head of the EPA Scott Pruitt will spearhead the Trump administration’s efforts to increase water pollution and accelerate man-made climate change.\n2:54 p.m. R.I.P.
