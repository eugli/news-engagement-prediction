Jones said that during the same time his father died, he had just become a dad himself. During the grieving process, he spent time reflecting on what he would want his newborn son to know about the grandfather he would never get a chance to meet. \n“He’s (Bowie) has always been there supporting people that have always been weird, strange or a little bit different,” Jones said. \nDuring his speech, Jones praised his father’s willingness to be open and accepting of individuality. He dedicated his father’s award to anyone who has ever felt different, assuring that Bowie believed that being unique should be embraced rather than something to be ashamed over. \n“This award is for all the kooks and all the people that make the kooks,” he said. \nEarlier in the show, David Bowie also won for 'Male Solo Artist.' Actor Michael C. Hall accepted the award. Just last year, Hall starred in the musical Lazarus, a show based on Bowie's 1976 film The Man Who Fell to Earth . \nBlackstar was released on Bowie’s 69thbirthday.
