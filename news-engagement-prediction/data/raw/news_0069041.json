(Aren Gaspar for SBS) (SBS) A police helicopter hovered overhead as protesters condemned the visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Source: Tweet \nHundreds of protesters have marched through Sydney streets to condemn Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as he makes a historic visit to Australia. \nA police helicopter hovered overhead as protesters at Town Hall criticised the Australian government's support of Mr Netanyahu, who was described by speakers as a racist warmonger. \nThere has been some tension between different groups, and officers from the riot squad quickly removed a man who approached the crowd yelling \"long live Israel\". \nMr Netanyahu flew into Sydney this week as the first sitting Israeli prime minister to set foot on Australian soil, amid criticism of his government for expanding its settlements in the occupied West Bank. \nAustralian-Palestinian Rihab Charida told SBS: \"I’ve come here to join the protest because Netanyahu, like every other Israeli prime minister before him, have just blatantly denied Palestinian basic rights and have continued to exploit Palestinian land, with no repercussions.\" \n“It doesn’t surprise me that he’s welcome in Australia, because the Australian government has historically supported Israel,\" she added. \nSBS senior political reporter Daniela Ritorto spoke with protesters: \nWhen asked about the bipartisan support for a two-state solution and the peace process, Ms Charida said Israel's settlement expansion in the West Bank over decades had made that unviable. \n\"Decades of theft of land and denial of basic rights, and rights to access water for example, decades of that type of thing, has rendered the two-state solution impossible anyway,\" she said.

Palestinians make up the largest number of refugees in the world and have been for the longest period. These ongoing issues are the issues that need to be resolved in a peace process.\" \n— Serkan Ozturk (@SerkanTheWriter) February 23, 2017 \n-with AAP Related Jewish community welcomes Netanyahu at Bondi Synagogue on controversial visit Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has spent his first day in Australia fielding questions over Palestinian statehood.
