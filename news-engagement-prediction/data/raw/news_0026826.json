How do we sell our minerals if people are erecting tariff barriers against them? How do we get in to supply chains? \n\"And then you get round to the issues here. We keep debating tolerance all the time â€” look at the neighbourhood in which we live. \n\"We sit here alongside the biggest Muslim nation in the world, utterly dependent on close relations with them to control immigration, and to control our defences. \n\"Why do you want to go round kicking them up the backside?\" \nMr Beazley said the WA preference deal was \"desperate\". \n\"It's an extraordinary thing to do: To diss your National Party colleagues, to probably force a few of them out of Parliament and replace them with One Nation people,\" he said. \nSome One Nation candidates in WA have threatened to disobey their own party over the controversial preference deal. \nMeanwhile, Mr Beazley, who finished his term as US ambassador last year, described Donald Trump's presidency as \"as bad as it gets, and it's not over yet\". \n\"It obviously has to get better. I suspect it couldn't get worse.\" \nWatch the interview tonight on Lateline at 9:30pm (AEDT) on ABC News 24 or 10:30pm on ABC TV.
