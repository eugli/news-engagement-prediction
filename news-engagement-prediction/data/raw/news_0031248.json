But now Li is a free man and he's even legally changed his name to Will Baker. He'll be living not too far away from Tim McLean's mother,\" Ambrose said in the post.\n\"I think I speak for a lot of Canadians when I say this doesn't seem right.\"\nREAD MORE: Rough time for Tim McLeanâ€™s parents following absolute discharge decision \nThe victim's mother, Carol de Delley, declined comment Friday in a Facebook post, saying she had \"no words.\"\nOn Saturday, de Delley posted that she wanted Baker to be legally obligated to treat his illness.\n\"I've been telling the public for 9 yrs this was coming,\" de Delley said in the post.\nConservative member of Parliament James Bezan has also criticized Baker's release. He said earlier in the week it would be an insult to de Delley and McLean's other relatives.\nBaker started living on his own in a Winnipeg apartment last November but was still subject to rules and nightly monitoring to ensure he took his medication.\nHis doctors described him as a model patient who had not been treated for schizophrenia at the time of his attack. After his arrest and placement at the hospital, he responded well to medication and understood that he must continue to take it to keep his illness at bay, they said.\nREAD MORE: Freedom granted to man who beheaded passenger on Greyhound bus \nSome of the people who responded to Ambrose's call for Trudeau to prioritize the rights of victims noted the killing, sentencing and gradual relaxing of conditions took place while the federal Tories were still in power.\nThe Supreme Court of Canada ruled in 1999 that a review board must order an absolute discharge if a person doesn't pose a significant threat to public safety.\nThe ruling added there must be clear evidence of a significant risk to the public for the review board to continue imposing conditions after a person is found not criminally responsible.\nPhotos Federal Opposition Rona Ambrose leader is criticizing a decision giving complete freedom to a man who beheaded and cannibalized a Greyhound bus passenger in Manitoba.
