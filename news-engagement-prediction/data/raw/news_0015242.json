When she failed to return, family members reported her missing and the search began. \nHer body was found by her father about 14 blocks from her home about 9pm, with the medical examiner’s office later ruling her death a homicide, saying she was strangled. \nHer death sparked a massive manhunt. \nPolice recovered her killer’s DNA from Vetrano’s body, but the sample did not match anyone in the New York and national DNA databases of convicted criminals. \nHer parents spoke out last week, trying to renew momentum in their daughter’s case, six months after her body was found, and renewing their calls for police to approve the use of familial DNA to track down her killer. \nFamilial DNA testing would allow investigators to find a partial match — possibly a relative of the killer. \nThe circumstances behind the suspect’s capture have not been disclosed.
