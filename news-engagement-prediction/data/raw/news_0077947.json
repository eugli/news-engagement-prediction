(Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP) Andrew Dalton Associated Press \nAn unsuspecting group of tourists got a trip right into the heart of Hollywood Sunday night that included kisses from Denzel Washington , selfies with Ryan Gosling and a chance to rub a newly won gold statuette called Oscar. \nHost Jimmy Kimmel told the Dolby Theatre audience during Sunday's Academy Awards that the group was told they were going to stop at an exhibit of Oscar gowns and tuxedos. \n\"But we didn't tell them,\" Kimmel said, \"that people would be in them.\" \nMOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR \nThe lights went down in the theater, then came up as the group walked in to cheers from Hollywood's royalty. \nThey were all different ages and ethnicities and most were wearing shorts or sweats or other casual tourist garb. Suddenly they found themselves shaking hands with Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban, who were seated in the front row along with Washington, Gosling and Meryl Streep. \nAmong the group was Gary Cole of Chicago, dressed in a baseball cap, glasses and a \"Hollywood\" sweatshirt. When Kimmel learned he was engaged he asked Washington to be his best man. Instead the actor stepped forward and pronounced Cole and his fiancee husband and wife. \nThe group was so stunned, most were mute at first, but the squeals of glee slowly emerged as they realized their good fortune. \nGosling handed out candy to Cole, who kissed the hands of Kidman and most of the other women in the front row. \nAt Kimmel's urging, some stars gave the wide-eyed tourists items from their purses. Jennifer Anniston handed over her sunglasses. \nHighlights from the 89th Academy Awards. \nCole appeared to be the night's biggest winner, however. Within minutes he had a hashtag #GaryFromChicago and his hometown basketball team, the Chicago Bulls, offered him free tickets to a game. \nBefore the group left, Kimmel asked Mahershala Ali , who won for best supporting actor earlier in the evening, if everyone could touch his Oscar on the way out. \nAli obliged.
