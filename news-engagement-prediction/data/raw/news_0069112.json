I can conjure up that emotion like it was yesterday. \nI met him on our summer soccer team, we started going out in middle school, he dumped me in high school, and I thought it was the end of the world. \nLike Vincent van Gogh’s last words, I thought for sure “the sadness will last forever.” \nBut look at me now! I’m 27 years old, doing OK in my career and totally gay! It’s funny how life works out. \nThat said, a part of me wishes I had a “breakup photo shoot” with my first love. Imagine being able to go back and look at gems like this: Harrison Bach \nWhile absolutely, totally ridiculous, it draws the same reaction from me when I see engagement and pregnancy photo shoots on my Facebook: laughter! \n(Am I a bitter hobgoblin who hates other peoples’ happiness and relishes in others’ heartbreak? Probably. Why don’t you go ask my high school boyfriend?) \nThe ex-couple pictured are Harrison and Jackie, and they broke up in 2015. They were together for three and a half years before the distance between their colleges wedged itself betwixt their relationship. \nAfter over a year since their breakup, on New Year’s Eve 2016, they got together after Harrison had an idea. \nHe said, \nI see my friends who are in relationships doing really nice professional photography photo shoots. I had the idea of doing the same thing in the same setting, but post-relationship, in a different way. Harrison Bach \nHarrison said that he and his ex were getting along very well, and while they first started to “fake” their emotions, it ended up becoming really sad for the two. \nJackie said, \nTaking those pictures felt like slipping right back into our relationship — the good and bad. Looking at them now, I am reminded of every thing about him I fell in love with. \nTaking photos that showcase the end of your relationship has to be an emotional rollercoaster. Hopefully, these two realize they’re young and they’ll always hold a special place in each other’s hearts. \nHere’s the only “breakup photo” I have with my high school boyfriend and me. Hope Schreiber \nAh, drunk in the middle of the woods in a tent! Some of my favorite memories of high school happened there. Here’s my ex holding me while I’m trying to spoon a lady — truly a sign of things to come.
