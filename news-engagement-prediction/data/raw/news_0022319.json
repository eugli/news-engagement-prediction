The prize? A three-bedroom cottage on the market for the first time in 90 years. \nA crowd of about 30 people gathered outside 1 Callan Street to watch as the home of 97-year-old May Bartlett went under the hammer. \nThe property, which last traded in 1927 for £430, was one of 577 auctions scheduled across Sydney on Saturday. \nAuctioneer Damien Cooley opens 1 Callan Street, Rozelle which sold for $1,308,000 on Saturday morning. Photo: Fiona Morris \nRobbie and Elizabeth Allison – a North Bondi couple hoping to secure a home ahead of the birth of their first child – kicked off proceedings with an opening bid of $1.1 million, which was quickly met by a bid from the only other registered party – an investor couple from nearby Camperdown. \nIt may have only been a two-horse race but both parties meant business with the price quickly ascending in $25,000 increments to $1,275,000. \nWe’re all part of the puppetry of the overinflated prices in Sydney. Robbie Allison, underbidder. \nThe bidding then slowed to $10,000, $5000 and eventually $1000 bids, until Mr and Mrs Allison were knocked out of the race by a $3000 jump. \nUnderbidders Robbie and Elizabeth Allison, who are expecting their first child in May, had been hoping to start their family in the Rozelle home. Photo: Fiona Morris \nThe home sold for $1,308,000, which was $58,000 over reserve. \nThe Allisons, who are expecting their first child in May, were disappointed with the result. This was the fifth auction they had been to since they started looking for a home last year. \n“Thanks Sydney, for destroying our dream of owning a home,” Mr Allison said half-jokingly. \nWinning bidders Sabrina Min and Tony Wong are congratulated on their purchase. Photo: Fiona Morris \n“It’s hard when it’s only a two-horse race,” he added. “You can end up feeling bad for the buyer … if we knew he had more cash to spend than us we would have left him with it instead of driving up the price and still missing out.” \n“We’re all part of the puppetry of the overinflated prices in Sydney.” \nDespite a slightly softer market, investor activity is not showing signs of slowing down. The latest figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that investor loans surged to a near-record high in November, jumping 25.5 per cent to $7.19 billion. \nThe Rozelle cottage last traded in 1927 for 430 pounds. Photo: Supplied \nInvestors now account for 56.7 per cent of all loans in NSW. \nTony Wong, who bought the property as an investment with partner Sabrina Min, said they had reached their price limit. \n“We’re really happy we got it, it’s still sinking in,” he said. \nVendor May Bartlett moved into the Rozelle cottage in 1927 as a 7-year-old.

Photo supplied. \nIn the neighbouring suburb of Lilyfield a first-home buyer couple had better luck, knocking out a local developer to secure an original weatherboard house. \nThe home at 21 Lamb Street was on the market for the first time in 35 years. \nFour of six registered bidders battled it out for the deceased estate, which eventually sold for $1,560,000 – $60,000 over reserve – after the young couple knocked out the competition with a final $30,000 bid increase. \n“The vendor is really pleased with the result, but it’s bittersweet, as it was his mother’s home,” said Andrew Liddell of BresicWhitney Balmain. \nHe said the couple were planning to move in to the property and then undertake an extensive renovation down the track.
