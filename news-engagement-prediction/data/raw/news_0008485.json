He died in 1996. Armstrong had been an IPS 17 teacher when he went to World War I. Students from the school, which was next to Attucks High School, wrote letters to the soldier.

Schools, churches, theaters and roller rinks were closed, a no-spitting ordinance was strictly enforced on the streets of Indianapolis and people were ordered to wear face masks to prevent the spread of the deadly virus. \nWe know some of this from history books. But now, we get a more personal account from Indianapolis students who were caught up in both dramas. \nNearly a century ago, Beatrice Williams was a middle-school student at the former IPS School 17, a school for African-American children adjacent to Crispus Attucks High School just west of Downtown. As part of a class assignment, she and several other students wrote to a former teacher at the school, Sgt. Irven Armstrong, who was serving in the 351st Field Artillery in France. \n\"All of the schoolchildren are doing all they can to help the men and boys who have gone over there,\" Beatrice wrote to Armstrong. \"We are bringing peach seeds to school to be used in making carbon for gas masks. A liberty loan drive began here Oct. 28, and from the way the papers read, the colored people did their bit. We children are buying thrift stamps. The teachers still give us our buttons to show where we rank in the thrift army. I am corporal now, but by the time this letter reaches you I hope to be a sergeant. There has been an epidemic of influenza here. Schools, churches and all places of amusement were closed for four weeks.\" \nBeatrice's letter and nine others are part of a collection owned by the Indiana Historical Society . Two of those letters have been included in a World War I exhibit commemorating the 100th anniversary of the United States' entry into the war. \"The Great War Through Hoosier Eyes,\" is on display until July 8 at the Indiana History Center, 450 W. Ohio St. \nOn Saturday, those letters will be brought to life as part of a program celebrating Black History Month. Actors from Lawrence Central High School will offer dramatic readings of the letters in a presentation called \"Sincerely, Sgt. Armstrong.\" Buy Photo \nThis is a letter written by Velma Pearl Pritchett when she was a student at IPS 17, written to Irven Armstrong when he was a World War I soldier. Armstrong had been a teacher at IPS 17, which was next to Attucks High School. This letter is from a collection which is represented in \"The Great War Through Hoosiers Eyes\" exhibit at the Indiana History Center. Thursday, January 26, 2017 (Photo: Kelly Wilkinson/IndyStar) \nArmstrong, who grew up in Westfield and went on to teach at Attucks for many years after the war, died in 1996 at age 104. Found as part of his estate were the letters he had received nearly 80 years earlier on the battlefield in France. \nToday, it is Wilma Moore's privilege and joy to share those letters with the public. Moore is senior archivist of African-American history for IHS. For 30 years, she's been researching and cataloging bits of the past and educating Hoosiers along the way. \n\"Everything just speaks of growing up here in Indianapolis,\" she said, from the lined paper the letters are written on to stories about the community she loved. \"To read these letters just takes me right back there.\" \nEven though she was in school in the 1950s and '60s, she said, not much had changed \nMoore, who graduated from Attucks and went on to Indiana University for her undergrad and graduate degrees, recalls the \"camaraderie and loving environment\" she experienced going to \"the colored schools with the colored teachers and the colored kids.\" \n\"I say it kind of in jest when I say colored, but for me it was a very good time. We learned so much. I think that's so important in a learning environment that you are surrounded by people who care what you're learning, who want you to succeed. Your success was their success. We certainly felt that in those schools with those teachers. They cared about us.\" \nAs Moore looks at the letters, she comments on the excellent punctuation, grammar, spelling, vocabulary and handwriting. The latter reflecting the loops and cursive style no longer taught in many schools.

(Photo: Kelly Wilkinson/IndyStar) \n\"I have to admit, my most favorite letter is written by Velma Pearl Pritchett — don't you just love that name? Velma Pearl. Her letter reads like something from an F. Scott Fitzgerald novel. She's very dramatic, and I like that.\" \nAll of the letters are dated Nov. 7, 1918, and all contain the letter writer's address. Velma Pearl lived at 1034 Fayette St. Moore reads aloud an excerpt: \"Dear Sgt. Armstrong, I hope you can come back and see School 17 once more. We are making another great drive for thrift stamps. School has been closed for four weeks on account of the epidemic called Spanish influenza. I was very sorry school closed, but I would much rather stay at home than to come to school while the epidemic was raging.\" \nLuckily for Indianapolis, the flu didn't rage as badly as in other communities, but business owners seethed over forced closings, including those operating \"dry\" beer saloons, many of whom defied the order from the Board of Health and were subsequently arrested. \n\"Others found new — but legal — ways to carry out their normal business. People who formerly gathered to knit or sew for soldiers continued projects at home, aided by a copy of the October 13 edition of the Indianapolis Star, which published the knitting pattern for producing regulation Army sweaters. People campaigning for office canceled public appearances and relied instead on advertising and visits to individual voters.\" (originally published in The Indianapolis Star, Oct. 13, 1918.) \n\"Some clergy published their sermons in newspapers as a way to reach their congregations. In fact, with so many people cooperating and staying home on Sundays, Mayor (Charles) Jewett took the opportunity to have the fire department scrub the empty downtown streets and sidewalks.\" (The Indianapolis News, Oct. 14, 1918.) \nMoore, who is nearing retirement, said she likes to think that she would have been friends with Velma Pearl, Beatrice and the other young letter writers of that day. \n\"I was so happy to get these letters. This is one of my favorite collections, if not my favorite,\" she said. \"It has a lot to do with my ability to identify with these young girls. It's so fun and and so interesting, I just have to smile.\" \nShe is grateful that Armstrong kept the letters for so many years and that she can now share them with a wider audience. \n\"It's a good guess that these were near and dear to Irven Armstrong's heart. They don't surface until after his death, which makes me think they could have been part of his estate, and they must have meant a lot to him. The man doesn't die until (1996). and he still has these letters from 1918.\" \nCall IndyStar reporter Maureen Gilmer at (317) 444-6879. Follow her on Twitter: @MaureenCGilmer. Sincerely, Sgt.
