And he thinks Brady would be a pretty decent college football coach as well.\nIn an ESPN interview Wednesday , Harbaugh — who, like Brady, played quarterback for the Wolverines during his college years — spoke glowingly of his fellow Michigan alumnus.\n“I don’t think he gets the credit that’s due to him,” he said. “People compare him to other people. He is the greatest football player of all time and he’s not getting that [credit]. That’s his due, and he doesn’t quite get it the way he should.”\nBrady, who played for Michigan from 1996 to 1999, visited Harbaugh on the field before a home game last fall, while he was serving his Deflategate suspension. Harbaugh said Wednesday that he was particularly impressed with the 39-year-old’s longevity.\n“If you can play that good, that consistently great year-after-year-after-year-after-year, game-after-game-after-game-after-game, nobody’s ever done that,” he said, according to ESPN.\nBut if Brady ever does retire and wanted to coach at his alma mater, Harbaugh even joked that the Patriot could take his job.\nHarbaugh was asked, though, if he felt Brady could one day be his quarterbacks coach. Harbaugh said “that would be phenomenal” before taking it a step further.\n“Head coach here someday,” Harbaugh said. “Quarterback coach, coordinator, head coach.”\nSo would Harbaugh step aside for him if it came to that? Harbaugh laughed for a second and smiled.\n“For Tom Brady,” Harbaugh said. “I will give him a deep long bow, shake hands and I’ll coach the quarterbacks for him.”\nBut it doesn’t seem like Harbaugh needs to worry about handing over his play sheet and whistle anytime soon. Asked about Harbaugh’s comments, Brady seemed to throw cold water on his future coaching career prospects.\nClick over to ESPN for the rest of Harbaugh’s near-endless praise for the Patriots quarterback.", "external_links": ["https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/18600300/michigan-coach-jim-harbaugh-says-new-england-patriots-qb-tom-brady-greatest-football-player-ever"], "published": "2017-02-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T01:39:28.075+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
