An associate professor can have 6 PhD students and 2 MPhil students, while for an assistant professor the numbers are 4 and 1,” he said. \nRead more: JNU relents, goes back to old admission policy for MPhil, PhD \nKumar also asserted that the rule has existed since 2010 and it wasn’t properly implemented. “We have only uploaded it to ensure it is properly followed,” he said. \nDSF said they will undertake a signature campaign addressed to the Visitor of JNU, the President of India, to annul the forged minutes of the academic council meeting which has allowed for the adoption of the UGC gazette. \nRead more: JNU proposes two-stage test for admission to MPhil, PhD \nFormer JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) president Sucheta De slammed the move and said, “Students may or may not be admitted in a year.
