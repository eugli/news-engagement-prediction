Is Jose Mourinho sending a message to Anthony Martial? \nManchester United supporters were concerned when Martial was not in the starting line-up and then Jose Mourinho appeared to send another message to the former Monaco striker during the game. \nThe Special One made three substitutions. Daley Blind came on for Marcos Rojo at half-time. Marouane Fellaini replaced Juan Mata with 13 minutes remaining. \nAnd, finally, Anthony Martial watched on as Ashley Young replaced Marcus Rashford. \nIf, Jose Mourinho is sending a message to Anthony Martial, it feels like it is being delivered in a particularly harsh manner! That's a message to Martial if ever I've seen one, Young coming on for Rashford. \n— Alex Shaw (@AlexShawESPN) February 5, 2017 NO ANTHONY MARTIAL AGAIN. \nGotta horrible feeling he won't be here next season. Would hate for that to happen! #LEIMUN #MatchdayMac \n— Full Time DEVILS (@FullTimeDEVILS) February 5, 2017 Ashley Young comes on in place of Marcus Rashford instead of Anthony Martial. There is something deeply wrong going on with Martial. Uh oh. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T00:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T20:01:58.987+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
