By: FE Online | Published: February 20, 2017 12:43 PM Indians would find that they should be able to continue their jobs and markets in the US within the same time zone and at lower costs and an abundance of skilled labour. (Reuters) \nSpeaking to the Indian Express about US President Donald Trumpâ€™s plan to build a wall and Mexico pay for the same, she said that borders had their own cause and effect dynamics and it was highly unlikely to be changed by artificial actions. And if Donald Trump went ahead and cracked the H1B visas on India, Mexico would be happy to relocate them, she said. She added that it was high time for the diversification of trade relations and Mexico was focussed on seizing the opportunity for more Mexican companies to come to India. \nSpeaking about the Wall again, the Mexican ambassador said that her country viewed the border as busy, rich and lively and hence should be a ground for interaction, prosperity and a development that both the countries could share. She said that to deal with the problem of illegal immigration, it was important for both the parties to address and reason and work to achieve prosperity for the entire continent. According to Pria, Mexicans represent 8% of American GDP. The USA has more than 570,000 businesses belonging to Mexican immigrants, generating $17 billion per year. Moreover, a report by Pew Research revealed that more than a million Mexicans left the USA and returned to Mexico between 2009 to 2014. \nAlso watch: \nSpeaking about the relations between Indians and Mexicans, Pria said that Mexicans have been visiting India for a few years now with the intentions of doing business in a promising and ever growing market. She said that if the US enforces harsher proposals such as the H1B visas, on which Indian IT companies remain severely dependent on, Mexico would be happy to relocate them. She said that Indians would find that they should be able to continue their jobs and markets in the US within the same time zone and at lower costs and an abundance of skilled labour.
