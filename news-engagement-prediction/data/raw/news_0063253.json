(JOSHUA ROBERTS/REUTERS)  06 PM \nNATIONAL HARBOR, Md. — In a rare public appearance, President Trump's top adviser told a friendly crowd that the \"corporatist, globalist media\" will remain an enemy of the Trump administration. \nSteve Bannon, Trump's chief strategist and the former head of the right-wing populist Breitbart News, ramped up his strong criticism of the media while promising years of trench warfare to seize control of the country. \n\"They're corporatist, globalist media who are adamantly opposed to the nationalist economic agenda,\" Bannon said, dismissing the hundreds of reporters in the back of the Conservative Political Action Conference convention hall as an amorphous group of opponents. \n\"Is that the opposition party back there?\" he half-joked earlier on, using his favorite phrase for reporters, before saying that just as the media was \"dead wrong on the chaos of the campaign\" and the \"chaos of the transition,\" they're \"dead wrong\" with recent reports about chaos in the administration. \nThat open hostility was a different tone than White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, who before Bannon chimed in said that while hoped \"the media would catch up eventually\" to what he sees as Trump's successes, he's \"so conditioned to hearing\" harsh reporting. Donald Trump in the White House \nBannon outlined three main areas where the Trump administration will continue to focus in the coming months: \"National security and sovereignty,\" including border security and immigration, \"economic nationalism\" that includes renegotiating trade agreements around the world and remaking the tax code and healthcare system, and \"deconstruction of the administrative state,\" a wide-ranging planned attack on the federal bureaucracy. \nAnd he said the battle for the direction of the country is only beginning. \n\"If you think they're going to give you your country back without a fight you're sadly mistaken,\" he said. \nBannon and Priebus spent much of the joint appearance attempting to show how close they are, after regular reports about the tensions between them.

(JOSHUA ROBERTS/REUTERS) \nPriebus called Bannon \"A very dear friend and someone that I work with every second of the day,\" while Bannon called Priebus \"indefatigable.\" \nAnd while he admitted he didn't agree philosophically with everyone in the White House or GOP, he argued conservatives, libertarians and right-wing populists need to hang together — and stand behind Trump. \n\"We have wide and sometimes divergent opinions, but the core of what we believe … that we're a nation with a culture and a reason for being, and I think that's what unites us,\" he said. \"We're a coalition. A lot of people have strong beliefs about different things but you understand that you come together to win,\" he said.
