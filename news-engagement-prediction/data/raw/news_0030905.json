Steve James has accomplished just that, all before he can legally drink. \nA story in the Metro revealed James is only 18 years old and began as a classical pianist. Among other projects, James contributed to the song \"Purpose\" off of Justin Bieber's hit album of the same name. Now, James has been nominated for a Grammy for his contribution. Bieber's album is one of five nominated for Album of the Year. \nBesides receiving a Grammy nomination, James was also a member of the committee voting for one of this year's categories. \n\"It's no secret that dance music — especially the new generation — isn't always so well-represented in the Academy because there are so many long-standing members who maybe aren't as up-to-date with what's current,\" James told the paper. \"So [being a Grammy nominee] is a great opportunity to be involved.\" \nTalk about an after school activity!
