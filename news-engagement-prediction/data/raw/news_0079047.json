The official said the president drew inspiration for his address from conversations he has had with “healthcare industry leaders, law enforcement officials, coalminers, other union representatives and frontline workers”. \nTrump is also expected to take credit for swiftly acting on a string of pledges he made to supporters during the campaign.\nAs of Monday evening, the official said Trump was still working on his speech. In an email to supporters on Monday morning, Trump asked for their input on what he should discuss, requesting that all responses be sent by 10am EST on Tuesday.\n\nThe Democratic congressional leaders delivered a “prebuttal” to Trump, casting his early weeks in office as unsuccessful and chaotic. They denounced the president’s actions on immigration, healthcare and taxes, and said they could not envision working with him on any issue.\n\n“If past is prologue, the president will use populist rhetoric in his speech, but he won’t back it up with real actions,” the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said on Monday at the National Press Club.\n“He’ll talk like he favors working people, but his actions will desert them. He’ll present himself as a populist, but govern from the hard right.”\nNancy Pelosi, who joined Schumer at the National Press Club, said Democrats are steeled for a four-year battle against Trump’s “reckless agenda and incompetent judgment”.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer deliver a ‘prebuttal’ to Donald Trump’s upcoming address to a joint session of Congress at the National Press Club.

He later expressed sympathy for Dreamers and they appear to be exempt from deportation under the administration’s immigration crackdown. However, Democrats and immigration rights groups do not trust the president to keep his word. \nThe Democrats’ efforts are being led by the Rhode Island congressman Jim Langevin who said he wanted to put a human face on Trump’s policies, which have inspired protests at airports and in town halls across the country. Langevin will bring Ehsun Mirza, a Muslim American critical care doctor originally from Pakistan. \n“I hope that his presence on February 28th will serve as a reminder to the President that true Americans come in every color and creed – and not all are born here,” Langevin said in a statement. \nOther Democratic guests will include Sara Yarjani, an Iranian graduate student who was detained for 23 hours at Los Angeles international airport under the ban that had gone into effect hours before her arrival. Yarjani, who will be a guest of California representative Judy Chu, was sent back to Vienna, Austria, where she had been visiting family and was allowed to return only after a federal judge granted a temporary reprieve of the order. \nIn a show of party unity, Representative Keith Ellison on Monday announced that he would bring the DNC chairman, Tom Perez, as his guest to the address. Perez narrowly defeated Ellison to be chairman of the DNC on Saturday after a months-long contest to lead the still-divided party.\nDemocrats will respond to the speech with remarks in English by the former Kentucky governor Steven Beshear, who lowered insurance rates in his state with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, and in Spanish by Astrid Silva, an immigration activist and Dreamer from Nevada.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T18:45:51.671+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
