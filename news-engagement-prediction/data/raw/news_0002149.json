And it's not at all clear why.\nThe company has celebrated the made up holiday – ostensibly to celebrate \"the importance of connecting\" – the last two years. But in 2015 and 2016 it was celebrated on 4 February, which Facebook said at the time was also its birthday, and comes two days after it is being celebrated this year.\nIt isn't clear how the day came about, how it is intended to help its users or what it's actually for. Facebook is celebrating by showing a video to every one of the more than a billion people who log into it each day, in which a person made up of tiny pictures of a users' friends is shown dancing around.\nGadgets and tech news in pictures 44 show all Gadgets and tech news in pictures 1/44 A humanoid robot gestures during a demo at a stall in the Indian Machine Tools Expo, IMTEX/Tooltech 2017 held in Bangalore\nGetty Images\n2/44 A humanoid robot gestures during a demo at a stall in the Indian Machine Tools Expo, IMTEX/Tooltech 2017 held in Bangalore\nGetty Images\n3/44 A humanoid robot gestures during a demo at a stall in the Indian Machine Tools Expo, IMTEX/Tooltech 2017 held in Bangalore\nGetty Images\n4/44 Engineers test a four-metre-tall humanoid manned robot dubbed Method-2 in a lab of the Hankook Mirae Technology in Gunpo, south of Seoul, South Korea\nJung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty Images\n5/44 Engineers test a four-metre-tall humanoid manned robot dubbed Method-2 in a lab of the Hankook Mirae Technology in Gunpo, south of Seoul, South Korea\nJung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty Images\n6/44 The giant human-like robot bears a striking resemblance to the military robots starring in the movie 'Avatar' and is claimed as a world first by its creators from a South Korean robotic company\nJung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty Images\n7/44 Engineers test a four-metre-tall humanoid manned robot dubbed Method-2 in a lab of the Hankook Mirae Technology in Gunpo, south of Seoul, South Korea\nJung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty Images\n8/44 Waseda University's saxophonist robot WAS-5, developed by professor Atsuo Takanishi\nRex\n9/44 Waseda University's saxophonist robot WAS-5, developed by professor Atsuo Takanishi and Kaptain Rock playing one string light saber guitar perform jam session\nRex\n10/44 A test line of a new energy suspension railway resembling the giant panda is seen in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China\nReuters\n11/44 A test line of a new energy suspension railway, resembling a giant panda, is seen in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China\nReuters\n12/44 A concept car by Trumpchi from GAC Group is shown at the International Automobile Exhibition in Guangzhou, China\nRex\n13/44 A Mirai fuel cell vehicle by Toyota is displayed at the International Automobile Exhibition in Guangzhou, China \nReuters\n14/44 A visitor tries a Nissan VR experience at the International Automobile Exhibition in Guangzhou, China\nReuters\n15/44 A man looks at an exhibit entitled 'Mimus' a giant industrial robot which has been reprogrammed to interact with humans during a photocall at the new Design Museum in South Kensington, London\nGetty\n16/44 A new Israeli Da-Vinci unmanned aerial vehicle manufactured by Elbit Systems is displayed during the 4th International conference on Home Land Security and Cyber in the Israeli coastal city of Tel Aviv\nGetty\n17/44 Electrification Guru Dr. Wolfgang Ziebart talks about the electric Jaguar I-PACE concept SUV before it was unveiled before the Los Angeles Auto Show in Los Angeles, California, U.S\nReuters\n18/44 The Jaguar I-PACE Concept car is the start of a new era for Jaguar.

He thanked his users for \"being part of our community of friends\" and called on them to \"turn today into a day to celebrate a friend\".\nA year later – on 4 February, 2016 – came a press release and the idea of a video, which also stitched together \"special moments with your friends\". That release said that \"each year we recognize this day as Friends Day and invite the world to celebrate and reflect on the importance of connecting\".\nIt may be partly that Facebook is encouraging the day as a way of inspiring people to share more about themselves. The company is said to be concerned about the effects of \"context collapse\", where people post less and less about their own lives – reducing the value of the service and making it harder to harvest the ad data from which it makes its money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T16:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T11:31:20.271+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
