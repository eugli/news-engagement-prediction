When you win sometimes some players are singled out as they are treated like exceptional players but when you don’t do well sometimes focus should be a little bit more of the team aspect and not try to blame each other.\n‘The blame culture is part of the perception of people, but what is important is that we show a united front.\n‘We have a good opportunity to show that we are a united, strong unit and that we bounce back.\n‘When you don’t win you cannot as well say that all is well. You have to analyse that something is not right. It is our job to find where and to have a strong united response.’\nWenger is said to be close to walking away from Arsenal amid fan protests after 20 years\nIf the football's on, it's on Live tables Fixtures Scores Premier League Premier League Championship League One League Two Scottish Premiership Scottish Div 1 Scottish Div 2 Scottish Div 3 Ligue 1 Serie A La Liga Bundesliga More tables More fixtures More scores The Hull fixture at the Emirates Stadium carries the sub-plot of Wenger’s future, with the Frenchman said to be closer than ever to walking away from a post he has held for 20 years.\nIt is understood an element of his thinking will be determined by public appetite for him to stay, which appears to be at a new low with this current league challenge fading away fast. His attempts to rally support this week included the suggestion that Arsenal’s fans ought to be more like those at Spurs, which amounted to a somewhat risky expression of a reasonable sentiment.\nIt never takes long for a drama to become a crisis among Arsenal’s support at this time of year, which therefore makes this clash with Hull all the more important after successive defeats. Ordinarily, it would appear a straightforward fixture, except Hull have been revived to some extent by Marco Silva’s arrival last month.\nWenger said: ‘He is doing well. There are many top managers in Europe and they all come to England.\n‘I believe as well that they played well with Mike Phelan but so many times they were not rewarded by results and they had injuries as well. I think Hull always played good football.’\nArsenal face Hull, who have been revived to some extent by Marco Silva’s arrival last month", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=92172392&iu=/5765/dailymail.uk", "https://pixel.adsafeprotected.com/rfw/st/60025/9852880/skeleton.gif", "https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/ad/N33505.2292307MAILONLINE_UK_DAW/B9964859.134304502;sz=1x1;ord=", "http://i.mol.im/sport/football/footballtable/production/js/footballtable-29.0.0-0.min.js", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMailArsenal", "https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/306947776;134304502;g", "http://i.mol.im/sport/football/footballtable/production/css/football_at_glance-29.0.0-0.min.css"], "published": "2017-02-11T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:36:38.229+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
