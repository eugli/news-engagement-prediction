(Photo: Corbis RM Stills) Share Get daily   Thank you for subscribing!   \nNobody wants to smell bad. And, no doubt, deodorant is a decent way to ensure that throughout the day, you stay fresh. Or at least mask your body's odours. \nBut, sometimes, do you feel let down by your fragrance? Come 6pm, while you travel home, or you think, \"oh, maybe I'll try a different brand\". \nWell, it might not be your deodorant at all. You might be just doing it wrong, and minimising the formula's effectiveness. \nThere are some seriously common mistakes when it comes to preventing sweating and odour. And these changes might help you stay clean longer. Sally has a date and wants to be fresh (Photo: Onoky) There's a difference between deodorant and antiperspirant \nAntiperspirants help to reduce sweating, combating the root cause. Deodorants imply masks smells – it covers the surface as a quick fix. Deodorant might be a quick way to sort yourself out at work, but antiperspirant is probably better in the morning. Wet skin \nDon't apply straight out of the shower. You need your armpits to be completely free of moisture before putting on deodorant or antiperspirant, as they only work properly if put on dry skin.

Don't add and add \nLayering fragrances might seem like a good idea, but it's not. You need to apply products to clean skin – simply putting deodorant on top of deodorant isn't really going to actually help you if a pong has arrived. Applying at night Wait until you're dry to put on a fragrance (Photo: The Image Bank) \nIf you want to tool up properly, applying at night time is a neat trick, according to beauty experts. Antiperspirants take a while to kick in (a few hours), so if you put it on in the morning, then move around a lot, you might bring about some sweat. Moisturise your armpits \nIt might sound weird, but like the rest of your skin, your pits need some TLC. By keeping them hydrated, they'll stay healthier, and are less likely to smell.
