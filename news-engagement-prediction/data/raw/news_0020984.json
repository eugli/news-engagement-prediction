O’Donnell criticized Trump as a “snake-oil salesman on Little House On The Prairie” during a 2006 episode of The View . Trump responded by calling her “a woman out of control.” More recently, Trump insulted O’Donnell during several Republican debates when he was running for president. \nOn the current season of SNL , Bannon is being portrayed as the Grim Reaper. During last weekend’s episode, a sketch featuring Alec Baldwin ’s version of Trump ended with Grim Reaper Bannon pushing the president off to the side to reclaim his seat as leader of the free world. \nBaldwin’s Trump was left to play with a children’s toy. (The actual Trump, a vocal critic of SNL and Baldwin’s impersonation, did not comment via Twitter on the sketch.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T11:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T06:39:44.529+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
