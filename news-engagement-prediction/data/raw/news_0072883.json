Johan Wiktorin, a fellow at the Royal Swedish Academy of War Sciences, took to Twitter to suggest he had not heard of Bildt either. \nBut who is Nils Bildt? Dagens Nyheter reported that Bildt had in fact emigrated from Sweden in 1994 and that he was originally named Nils Tolling. He is not related to Carl Bildt, the well-known Swedish politician who has served as both Swedish prime minister and Swedish foreign minister (Nils is referred to as an \"unknown Bildt\" in the Dagens Nyheter headline). \nThe newspaper also reported that Nils Bildt had been convicted of a violent offense while living in Virginia and was given a one-year prison sentence in 2014. \nBildt is listed as one of the founding partners of Modus World LLC. The company, which says it is based in Washington, Brussels and Tokyo, offers a variety of consulting services, including the \"operations and management of possible kidnap and ransom situations,\" according to its website, and reports in the Japanese media suggest Bildt was involved a number of hostage negotiations involving Japanese citizens. \n\"Had I spent a year in prison, I would think I would remember it,\" Bildt said. \nDavid Tabacoff, executive producer of \"The O'Reilly Factor,\" defended the decision to book Bildt. \"Our booker made numerous inquiries and spoke to people who recommended Nils Bildt and after pre-interviewing him and reviewing his bio, we agreed that he would make a good guest for the topic that evening,\" Tabacoff said in a statement. \nHowever, Bildt's low profile made him a surprising choice, according to Swedish experts. Robert Egnell, a professor at Swedish Defence University, told WorldViews that he did know Bildt, but it was only by chance: The pair had studied together at King's College London in 2002. \nFox News' coverage of Sweden has become a subject of debate over the past week, after President Donald Trump referred to \"what's happening\" in the country during a rally in Florida last weekend. Swedish experts were confused by the comments, but Trump later clarified he had been referring to a segment with filmmaker Ami Horowitz that had aired on Fox News Channel's \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" \nHorowitz's film had suggested a link between refugees and increased crime rates in Sweden, but Swedish experts say he oversimplified the problem, and two policemen interviewed by the filmmaker said they had been misrepresented by him.
