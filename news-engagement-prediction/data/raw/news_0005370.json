Chris Hansen says Colorado welcomed more than 8,000 refugees in the past four years and that “we cannot turn our back on that legacy.” \nTrump suspended the U.S. refugee program and all entries from seven Muslim-majority nations for 90 days to review security screening procedures. Republican Rep. Patrick Neville said Trump’s order is “simply a temporary halt from some of the most dangerous areas.” No Republicans joined Democrats in approving the measure by voice vote. \nThe resolution will be considered by the Republican-led Senate, where leaders insist that immigration is a federal issue, not one for the statehouse. \n(© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.
