The new Nintendo Switch console follows the NES Classic and Super Mario Run in a line of products from the Japanese giant that have titillated gamers in recent months. \nYou're probably dying to get your hands on one. Well, hold up -- it's already hard to come by. Here's what you need to know about snagging the magically versatile gaming system, which costs $300, £280 or AU$470. \nUpdate, February 28, 10:51 a.m. CT: Here's the latest. \nAmazon UK and Game have the Switch available for preorder for £280 and free delivery in the UK. The Switch is not available to US residents through Amazon UK, but you can get it through Game internationally. Amazon is sold out in the US, but you can sign up for availability alerts. \nEB Games in Australia has preorders for AU$470, with a $50 deposit, but it does not ship overseas. It also has the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller for preorder. \nThe Nintendo Switch Pro Controller sold out almost immediately in most other places. GameSeek still has preorders of the Pro Controller for £58.22 (currently $72 or AU$100). It ships in the UK for free, and to other parts of the world for various shipping fees. \nWalmart is sold out of the Switch console online. You can still preorder many of the accessories and games through its website , though. Walmart has confirmed to me that starting at 12:01 a.m. local time on March 3 the Nintendo Switch will be available at Walmart Supercenters. Walmart will have the system available in gray, red and blue colors while supplies last. For Supercenters that are not open 24 hours, customers will need to call their local store to find out when the units will be available. \nGameStop is sold out of the console preorders online, but you may want to check with your local stores. You can also sign up for alerts on their websites. GameStop still has a wide range of Switch games that you can reserve online. \nGameStop will also be holding a midnight release event and offering a limited supply of consoles for those who didn't preorder, on a first come, first served basis. Some of these consoles will be part of Zelda: Breath of the Wild bundles that will be priced from $430 to $455 (around £345 to £365 or AU$560 to AU$590), according to a press release . \nBest Buy still has almost all of the accessories available for preorder and many of the games. On the day of the release, customers can pick up their preordered console, games and accessories at participating stores at 12:01 a.m. local time. Customers will also receive a free Zelda poster. Like GameStop, Best Buy will have units to purchase at some stores at the midnight event, but supplies will be limited. Since not all stores are participating, call your local Best Buy to get more information. \nTarget is sold out of the console and most of the games and accessories, but it says on the site more are coming soon. This flyer that has been making the rounds on Reddit states that there will be consoles available at Target stores on launch day at 8 a.m. local time. I checked my local Target sales paper and it does have the same Switch ad. Since these flyers can vary depending on location, your best bet is to call your own store for more information. \nWe'll be updating this piece as the Switch is restocked or when new information is released, so stay tuned! We finally got our hands on Nintendo's funky Switch console When to get it \nYou won't be able to get your hands on a Switch until March. The official release date is March 3 around the world. It will come in gray or a more colorful option with neon-blue and neon-red Joy-Con controllers. \nIf you want to try it before you buy it, Nintendo is taking the Switch on the road to six North American cities. Most of the dates have passed, now, but you can still see it in Los Angeles, March 3-5. Don't show up on the first two days, though. Friday and Saturday are invite-only but Sunday is free and open to the public. What it will cost \nThe Switch unit will officially cost $300 , AU$470 or £280. If Nintendo restricts production, as it did with the NES Classic , you may see the Switch's price jacked up hundreds of dollars by third-party sellers when it's finally released. \nNintendo says online gaming services will be free for a trial period after the console is released, but will become a subscription service later in the year. The service will reportedly cost between 2,000 and 3,000 yen in Japan, which converts to about $18-$26, £14-£21 or AU$23-AU$35 per year. Prices for other countries have yet to be announced. On Nintendo's site , the company says almost all of the games will need a paid online service subscription to play online. \nThe unit will come with a Switch console, two Joy-Con joysticks, two Joy-Con wrist straps, a Joy-Con Grip, the Nintendo Switch Dock, an HDMI cable and an AC adapter. \nThe Nintendo Pro Controller will be sold separately for $70, AU$95 or £60. Additional Joy-Con controllers will be sold for $80, AU$105 or £65. Nintendo Switch: All the games you'll get at launch (and beyond) Games \nNintendo has partnered with the industry's biggest names, such as Activision, EA, Capcom, Sega and Konami, in the hopes of providing a great selection of games for the Switch, but they're thin on the ground at launch. The highly anticipated Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild will be a launch title. Super Mario Odyssey will be released toward the end of 2017, while Mario Kart Deluxe 8 arrives midyear. \nMore than 80 third-party games are currently in development, such as Dragon Quest Heroes 1 and 2 and Project Octopath Traveler. Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, FIFA, Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and Fire Emblem Warriors are also coming to the Switch. \nDuring the Nintendo Switch presentation, two new games were shown to highlight the HD Rumble feature in the Joy-Con controllers. 1, 2, Switch is a party game, while ARMS is a boxing game. 1, 2, Switch is out on the same day as the console and ARMS is coming in the next few months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T01:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T20:37:12.744+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
