SUPPLIED \nThe Starfish Bobby Calf Project has held multiple peaceful protests during its three-year existence. \nTulloch is hoping about 20 picketers will join her at Auckland's ASB Showgrounds and promised the protest will be peaceful. \nREAD MORE: \n\"The point we're trying to make is we want to make visible the animals' plight behind the scenes,\" Tulloch said. Meatstock NZ \nMeatstock NZ is currently underway at the ASB Showgrounds in Auckland and it ends on February 26. \n\"People are consuming without thinking.\" \nThe protesters will be at the festival between noon and 1pm handing out information to those that want it. \n\"We can give information to people who want to know more... It's something they may come back and reflect on later.\" \nStarfish Bobby Calf Project was established three years ago to rescue a handful of bobby calves and raise awareness of the animals in the dairy industry. Since then, it has become an activist and animal rights platform, Tulloch said. Ad Feedback \nThe co-director of Meatstock, Simon Luke, said the protesters won't be met with any negativity and he's happy for them to be present at the festival. \n\"These people have the right to that opinion. There's always people on both sides of the fence with that particular topic [animal rights],\" Luke said. \n\"My personal opinion is about making sure people communicate with one another to make sure these protesters wouldn't feel like we'd be encouraging nasty or negative feedback. In return we would expect they wouldn't be nasty to our customers. I'm more than happy to have them voice their opinion.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T05:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:22:00.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
