We are not talking Mercedes-Benz here, just your little runabout cars. Even change out of people's purses,\" Ms Jennings said. \n\"There has been heightened police activity among sex worker establishments ... the likes of which we have not seen for over 20 years.\" \nPolice have told sex workers they are \"cleaning up\" the industry ahead of decriminalisation, Ms Jennings told the committee. 'No evidence of police corruption' in sex work \nThe bill to decriminalise sex work in South Australia is expected to go to a vote within the next six months. \n\"Because the bill is before a select committee at the moment, they're cleaning up the industry before it is decriminalised,\" Ms Jennings said. \n\"That's something that has been reported to us on at least three occasions from three separate establishments.\" \nPreviously giving evidence to the committee in October 2016, Chief Inspector Denise Gray argued police needed to keep the power to enter suspected brothels. \n\"To me, decriminalising it doesn't always make people safer; sometimes, it puts them more at risk because they don't build relationships with the police, they don't talk to the police,\" she said. \nChief Inspector Gray also said there was no evidence of \"endemic\" police corruption in relation to sex work. \n\"That's not to say an individual may have attended a brothel â€” I can't discount that, and I am sure that's occurred,\" she said. International students being deported: SIN \nMs Jennings also told the parliamentary committee international students working in the sex industry had been losing their visas and being deported as a result of the police crackdown. \n\"There has been a lot of activity amongst Asian brothels and that has resulted in a lot of students losing their student visas as well, and having to be sent home,\" Ms Jennings said. \nShe also accused police of telling sex workers that the organisation she manages, SIN, had tipped police off about the location of sex work establishments, which she denied. \n\"Off course, that is very damaging to our harm reduction work among sex workers, because they are not going to engage with us if they feel we are passing that information on,\" she said. \nMs Jennings argued for the full decriminalisation of sex work, saying currently sex workers did not have a good relationship with police and were too afraid to report crimes against them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:37:19.818+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
