Several healing centres in the UAE are offering illegal services where they claim to speak to the spirits of the deceased. Preying on the vulnerable, these \"psychics\" charge customers more than Dhs500 for a one-hour session, where they convey messages from their loved one who has passed away. Some of these healing centres are based in Jumeirah Lakes Towers, Jumeirah, Barsha Heights, as well as independent psychics who are running these businesses from their homes. During an undercover investigation by Khaleej Times, a staff member at an establishment that advertises itself as only a healing centre, said: \"If you bring a photo of the person that passed away, the psychic can do spirit channeling. She can channel the spirit of that person and can give them any messages they have. She can also tell you if your loved one is at peace and if they have any messages for you.\" When asked if the spirit channeling is a popular service at the centre, the staff member said: \"We are always full, so we are in demand. You have to book an appointment two to three weeks prior.\" One psychic in Jumeirah who runs her business from home also channels spirits. She claims to see spirits while waking up and can \"hear messages\" from her clients' loved ones. She said \"broken-hearted\" customers who miss their late loved ones visit her for help, so they can contact them. Undercover as a customer, one of the psychics said: \"You have recently lost someone. He's here in the room with me. He's saying he is happy and wants you to know that.\" The psychic, who does this as a full-time job, said that a return visit would have to be made as \"negative energy\" had to be removed by a method called cord-cutting - a service that would cost another Dhs500. Tarot card readers are also making big sums of money in the UAE. Several are operating from their homes and are charging customers Dhs300 to Dhs500 for an hour session. During another undercover investigation, the tarot card reader made general and obvious predictions, and like the psychic, recommended for a return visit. The tarot card reader said: \"You should book another visit so we know that your future is headed in the right direction. Khaleej Times came across five healing centres and individuals who are offering spirit channeling, tarot card reading, fortune-telling or cord-cutting services just in Dubai. There are several others in Sharjah as well. Waste of money A former Dubai expat, who requested to remain unidentified, said she spent thousands of dirhams in trying to contact her deceased lover. The expat was left heartbroken and in shock after her friend died in a road accident in 2011. She felt that her lover was trying to contact her after his passing, so she approached a psychic. However, after almost eight visits to the psychic who claimed to channel spirits, she felt it was time to move on. \"When I heard that there was someone who could see and speak to spirits, I immediately thought of him (her lover). The first time I went the psychic gave me so many details about our relationship that was true but each time I'd go she'd make the same general observations. \"I did waste a lot of money on that, but in some way it was nice speaking to someone about him over and over again. I realised in my last visit that I was wasting my time and money on this and that I had to move on.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T09:59:02.597+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
