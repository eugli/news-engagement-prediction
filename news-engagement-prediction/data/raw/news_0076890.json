Picture: AAP \nThe 194cm-tall centre only joined Brisbane in the off-season after three years with the Cowboys. \nHaving made his debut with the Roosters in 2012, his promising career has been constantly disrupted by injuries, including three knee reconstructions. \nBut Brisbane are hoping this can be the fresh start he needs, with Oates saying the duo could bring a fear factor on Thursday. \n“It’s a big edge now, isn’t it?” he said yesterday. \n“He’s very agile, quick ... hopefully we’re hard to stop. \n“This will be a great test for us. \n“You don’t know how (the Sharks) are going to turn up and how they’re going to defend. But I believe we have a pretty good connection.” media_camera Corey Oates is hoping to form a strong combination with Moga on Brisbane’s left edge. Picture: Peter Wallis \nThe man who could miss out through Moga’s inclusion is Titans recruit Mead. \nMead trained off a five man bench yesterday, which also included Alex Glenn, Herman Ese’ese, Tevita Pangai Jr and Jai Arrow. \nHe was rotated at right wing throughout the session, but if he does drop out of the team for Thursday’s game he could be sent back to Broncos affiliate club Wynnum Manly. \nMead has played well in the pre-season, but could be a victim of Bennett going for more size. \nBennett will name a 21-man squad today which will then be reduced to 19 tomorrow before the final 17 is announced on game day, as per the new NRL rules. \nBroncos five-eighth Anthony Milford, who attended the same Ipswich high school as Moga, said regardless of who was picked, his former schoolmate would handle the occasion. \n“He’s a very big boy ... he has been ever since we were young,” he said. \n“He’ll be hard to stop one-on-one. We’re going to need him on that left side.” \nMeanwhile, Kodi Nikorima and Benji Marshall are both expected to miss selection for the Round 1 clash. \nNikorima trained with the reserve grade players yesterday while Marshall is still recovering from an achilles injury.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:31:01.578+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
