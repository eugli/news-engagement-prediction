Simpson is the first ESPN production to be nominated for and win an Oscar. It collected a series of other awards leading up to Sunday. \nMORE: Sports movies that won Academy Awards \nThe series' director, Ezra Edelman, spoke during his acceptance speech of Simpson's ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her acquaintance Ronald Goldman, who were brutally slain in 1994 in Los Angeles. Simpson was accused of killing the two but was acquitted in 1995 during a murder trial that continues to fascinate Americans. \n\"This is for them and their families,\" Edelman said. \nA jury in a civil trial later found Simpson liable for the killings. \nEdelman said the movie was also for \"victims of police violence, of police brutality, racially motivated violence and criminal injustice.\" Watch This ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T09:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T04:50:03.577+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
