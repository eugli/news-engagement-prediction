(AP) \nLindsay Lohan claims she was \"racially profiled\" while wearing a headscarf at London's Heathrow Airport. \nThe actress said in a new interview that she was stopped while traveling to New York. \nThe \"Mean Girls\" star said an airport worker \"opened my passport and saw 'Lindsay Lohan' and started immediately apologizing, but then said: 'Please take off your headscarf.'\" \nShe said on \"Good Morning Britain\" Tuesday that the incident made her wonder \"how would another woman who doesn't feel comfortable taking off her headscarf feel?\" \nLohan was returning from Turkey, where she recently met President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. A post shared by Lindsay Lohan (@lindsaylohan) on Jan 27, 2017 at 1:53pm PST \nShe said she wore a headscarf in Turkey out of \"personal respect.\" \nLohan, who has been photographed carrying a Quran, says she finds \"solace\" studying the Muslim holy book and other religious texts. \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
