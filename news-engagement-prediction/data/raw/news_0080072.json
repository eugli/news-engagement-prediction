But with hundreds of thousands of civilians caught in the fighting, camps near the city cannot house all the displaced. Trends Iraq carnage , Islamic State \nIn what is believed to be the biggest exodus since local forces stepped up their operations to retake the western part of the city from Islamic State terrorist group (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) a week ago, the UN is now working to expand its camps near the city. \nUp to 400,000 civilians could be displaced by the fighting in west Mosul, according to humanitarian organizations’ estimates. While people continue to flee to safer areas from the western districts of Mosul, the existing camps near the city currently cannot house all the people expected to be displaced.

Nothing,” a displaced man from Mosul told RT. Another one said: “We left our house, our cars, everything we owned, we took nothing but our clothes. We are scared, tired and hungry. My situation speaks for itself.” \n“There are hundreds of thousands of civilians still inside west Mosul, still living under ISIS. These are people who have extremely limited access to food, clean drinking water, medication. And as the fighting rages, we simply have no idea how long these people are going to remain without access to all of those things, ” Human Rights Watch (HRW) Senior Iraq Researcher, Belkis Wille confirmed to RT. \n“The food and commodities pipelines in West Mosul have been broken for quite some weeks, and we get really desperate feedback from the people who we are able to reach,” UNICEF's Vigneau said, adding that some of the worst reports have been recently “confirmed by the west Mosul citizens who are fleeing the combat zones and start to arrive at the south part of the city, Hamam Al Alil .” \nLocated some 30 kilometers (20 miles) from west Mosul, the area has become a site for UN camps, with new shelters being constructed by the organization in a short period of time. \n“There are a lot of lessons learnt at least by UNICEF from east Mosul,” the UNICEF coordinator told RT, saying that the situation in west Mosul is even “more complicated.” \n“When the security allows humanitarian access, we will provide first emergency response,” he said, adding that for the time being efforts are concentrated on providing “first assistance and rapid response items such as hygiene kits, bottled water and canned food” for the Iraqi people “until they can reach a camp” with more services.

The government has called on the civilians to stay in their homes if they can, and if not, to ideally displace within the area,” the HRW researcher told RT, adding that in her opinion such tactics “will make the operation much more manageable.” \n“The main recommendation that the Iraqi authorities made early on, in the beginning of this operation was something called 'white flagging.' Civilians should put white flags on their roofs and their doors,” she explained, saying that by such signs the army will know there are no militants inside and that “this proved quite effective in east Mosul.” \nWATCH: 1,000s flee western Mosul in Iraq as fighting continues \nYet, it is “extremely tricky to know who is a civilian and who isn't,” she conceded, saying that although “anyone fleeing is treated as a potential terrorist suspect, and go through screening process... in west Mosul it will be extremely hard for armed forces... to make that distinction correctly.” West #Mosul trap: Iraqi forces retake 2 districts, up to 800,000 civilians caught in battle zone https://t.co/MCCqofXH2R — RT (@RT_com) 26 February 2017 \n“In a battle like that... the civilians are always the damage that happens in any type of street fighting,” retired US Army Major General, Paul Vallely told RT. \n“It's always a tragedy, but in order to completely neutralize and defeat the ISIS forces within that urban area, this is just what happens in warfare,” he said.
