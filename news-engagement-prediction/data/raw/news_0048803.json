This explains the substantial drop....In steam coal imports in January 2017 vis-a-vis the same month last year,\" mjunction CEO Vinaya Varma said. \n\nThere was a marginal drop in non-coking coal imports in January 2017 compared with December 2016 as non-power sector consumers stopped restocking the material after steam coal prices reversed its declining trend midway through January, Varma said. \n\n\"In fact, spot steam coal prices firmed up by around eight-nine per cent in South Africa, and also rose marginally in Indonesia during the month,\" Varma added. \n\nThe government had said, in September, 2016, that it was working on a plan to end dependency on coal imports in next 3-4 months in order to facilitate consumption of the surplus fossil fuel produced by Coal India. \n\n\"To tackle this problem of surplus, my ministry has drawn up an entire programme to see how we can completely eliminate import of coal by any state government or state discom in the next 3-4 months,\" Coal Minister Piyush Goyal had earlier said. \n\nCoal India accounts for over 80 per cent of domestic coal production.(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\nPress Trust of India Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T10:45:18.786+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
