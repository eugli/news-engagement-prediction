Conway tweeted Friday morning that she meant to say “Bowling Green terrorists” during the interview, referring to the arrest of two men in Kentucky charged with plotting to send weapons and money to Al Qaeda operatives.\nIn the time since the interview, Conway has been mocked on social media and a satirical website dedicated to the “victims” of Bowling Green appeared online, with a donate link that directed users to the ACLU.\nMaterial from the Associated Press was used in this report.", "external_links": ["https://www.bowlinggreenmassacrefund.com/", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2F02%2F08%2Fharvard-square-bookstore-mocks-kellyanne-conway-bowling-green-massacre%2FjKlQZHhash9VBZy4KV1CQO%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&t=Harvard", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2F02%2F08%2Fharvard-square-bookstore-mocks-kellyanne-conway-bowling-green-massacre%2FjKlQZHhash9VBZy4KV1CQO%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&title=Harvard", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Harvard", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2F02%2F08%2Fharvard-square-bookstore-mocks-kellyanne-conway-bowling-green-massacre%2FjKlQZHhash9VBZy4KV1CQO%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%26s_campaign%3dsm_gp%26hl=en-US", "https://twitter.com/KellyannePolls/status/827505588808667136", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BQQQiACgusf/?taken-by=harvardbookstore&hl=en", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2F02%2F08%2Fharvard-square-bookstore-mocks-kellyanne-conway-bowling-green-massacre%2FjKlQZHhash9VBZy4KV1CQO%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%3Fevent%3Devent25&tHarvard"], "published": "2017-02-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T06:23:55.631+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
