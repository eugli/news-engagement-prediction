Associated Press/Jessica Hill \nSTAMFORD, Conn. (AP) â€” An interracial Connecticut couple whose home was vandalized by a racial slur has been fined for failing to cover it up. \nThe Stamford Advocate reports the slur was spray-painted over Martin Luther King Jr. weekend on the garage door of Heather Lindsay, who's white, and Lexene Charles, who's black. \nLindsay says their home has been vandalized multiple times. She says Stamford authorities have failed to properly investigate and she won't remove the slur until they do. \nThe city issued a blight citation, which carries a $100 daily fine. \nNAACP representatives on Monday called for a full investigation, including canvassing the neighborhood and posting a patrol car to make sure the couple is safe. \nThe city's director of public safety says an investigation is underway.
