The Emerson, Lake & Palmer keyboard player, who shot himself at his California mansion last March aged 71, left a bungalow in Sussex, two Steinway pianos, artwork and various cars and motorbikes. His will stated his collection of awards, gold records and memorabilia should never be sold – but could be loaned to the Cleveland Rock Museum or Hard Rock Cafe.
