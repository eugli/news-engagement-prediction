Scotland's results do the talking \nTwo simple things impressed me most in Scotland's win over Wales. \nFirstly, the mere fact that they won. \nThere has been a lot of talk about how this young Scotland side stacks up against the teams of the past that won Five Nations titles and Triple Crowns. \nPreviously, they have produced promising performances without the results. Now, though they are heading into the final two rounds still with a chance of lifting the title and completing a clean sweep of the home nations.

Instead there were choruses of Flower of Scotland rolling around Murrayfield in the final 10 minutes, as the home team went away with the match. \nThey scored 20 unanswered points in the second half. In any hemisphere, at any level, that is a phenomenal performance. \nThe forwards made up for the loss of the injured Josh Strauss' heavy-duty ball carrying though sheer industry though. \nJohn Barclay led through deed as captain and Hamish Watson was an absolute bundle of energy, while Huw Jones was elusive and quick in the centres, keeping the Wales midfield honest and allowing the wings space to score their tries. \nAnd Stuart Hogg stood out once again. \nHe has superb acceleration, an eye for the gap and then the top-end speed to exploit it. \nBut against Wales it was his game-awareness - the ability to invariably do the right thing - that was key. \nFor Tommy Seymour's try he recognised that Huw Jones run had drawn the attention of the Wales defence and should be used as a decoy. \nFor Tim Visser's, he realised that George North was coming up fast and that he had to get that pass across his body as fast as possible. \nAfter that win, talk inevitably turned to the Calcutta Cup match against England in a fortnight's time. \nTheir best chance of attacking England is out wide. The catch is that they can't go there immediately. \nYou have to keep the opposition defence narrow with big runners or decoy angles to create the space. \nScotland have to put together a more complete performance than they have managed yet in the tournament. \nThey have to play as well as they did in the first half against Ireland across a whole match. If not, they won't win. Wales fizzle out after Cardiff fireworks \nThis was an incredibly disappointing weekend for Wales. \nTheir performance was wonderful against England a fortnight ago, even if the result was not what they wanted.
