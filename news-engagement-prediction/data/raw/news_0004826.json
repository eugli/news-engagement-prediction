India had set Pakistan 422 to win in the 2nd Test at Eden Gardens and the leg-spinner was in a mood to scalp up some victims. \nThe Kolkata crowd was no stranger to Kumble's heroics. Back in 1993, he had taken 6/12 against West Indies in the Hero Cup final at the same venue. \nNow it was time to enthrall them again. Having removed Shahid Afridi late on Day 4, the final day was the Kumble show as he literally ran through the side. \nAFP \nThe likes of Younis Khan and Inzamam-ul Haq were no match was for his flight and guile as Pakistan fell apart like a house of cards. \nKumble finished with 7/63 and the visitors were sent packing for 226. India won by 195 runs to lead the series 1-0. \nWhat made this performance truly special was that it came against our traditional rivals and took place at an iconic stadium.
