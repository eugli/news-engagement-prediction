'Time and age help you understand that the most important thing is always the team. Don't get me wrong, I want to play but sometimes you have to fight for it. Fabregas was instrumental during the 3-1 win over Swansea, scoring and laying on an assist 'Sometimes the easy way is to escape, to run away, to sulk and to want to leave, to create a drama.' Fabregas insists he wants to remain with Chelsea for a while yet. 'For sure, it's Chelsea I'm thinking about. Until the day Chelsea tell me they don't want me, I can leave, and it happens to everyone, then you have to move on. 'When my brain says you can't do it anymore then I will move, probably away from Europe. But for now, it's all about Chelsea and performing here.' He believes he is learning new things under Conte's guidance: 'I can understand there are doubts, the philosophy of the manager. He came in, wanted to see if I could adapt and I understand that. The former Arsenal and Barcelona midfielder readies himself before shooting to score 'As a player I'm someone who wants to play with the ball, maybe not so much the defensive side. But I adapted to the way he wants to play and hopefully I can play more. 'Now with Conte, I'm learning new things, new football. It makes it entertaining. I know sometimes I didn't play as much but even in training I'm learning and sometimes you think if you've been playing for a long time, won a lot, you've done everything and then you realise that in football you can never know everything. 'Hopefully I've reversed the situation from the beginning of the season to now and hopefully I can keep playing like that to keep my place.' For manager Antonio Conte, it was another significant step towards the Premier League title and his side are ten points clear of second-placed Tottenham with only twelve games remaining. Conte knows that even winning the Premier League this season does not make him bulletproof SUPER STAT Goals by Cesc Fabregas, Pedro, Diego Costa and Fernando Llorente made this the first time that four different Spain players scored in the same Premier League game. Chelsea had to demonstrate their resolve when Fernando Llorente equalised with a superb header on the stroke of half-time and Conte's men did so emphatically, with second-half strikes from Pedro and Diego Costa. Conte, however, remained in reflective mood following the brutal sacking of Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri and he knows that a Premier League title this season will not guarantee him long-term security in the Chelsea hotseat. 'In this type of modern football, it is not easy to start a project or to be sure you will stay in a for a long time in the same team. It is not only for me but for all coaches. Then for sure if you have the possibility to stay for many years in the same team, you can work to improve your idea. 'But the results... the results in this football are very important. We all know this and it can happen that one season you win the title and the next you can be going on your way.' Former Chelsea coach Paul Clement was furious his side were not awarded a stonewall penalty Paul Clement, who felt referee Neil Swarbrick should have awarded his side a penalty for a handball by Cesar Azpilicueta with the scores at 1-1, also showed his support for Ranieri and rebuked the Leicester board and players. 'Terrible. Really terrible,' Clement said. 'What he achieved last year, that they can make that decision so quickly... The players need to have a good look at themselves. The club have to take responsibility as well. 'They are the ones who hire the players, decide the length of contract, the amount the players get paid. I just think it's sad that someone who did so well, achieved the virtual impossible, nine months later he's been let go.'
