TOBY MELVILLE \nA mural depicting US President Donald Trump dancing with British Prime Minister Theresa May in London. \n\"Sweden,\" he clarified. \"Who would believe this? Sweden.\" \nREAD MORE \nThe world was briefly surprised since the biggest Swedish news of note from Friday was a report that \"a wooden moose got the attention of a lovesick moose bull.\" JONATHAN ERNST \nThank you, President Donald Trump, for having the guts to once again take time out of what is evidently a pretty cruisy sort of an official schedule to yell fresh insights at us. \nWhile this was inarguably a humiliating tragedy for the proud bull moose of Skellefteå, was hard to see any obvious reason why this would be connected with the threat of global terrorism – not least because the political affiliations of the moose bull, at the time of writing, remain unknown. \nFormer Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt reached out, world leader to world leader, to tweet \"Sweden? Terror attack? What has he been smoking? Questions abound.\" \nNow, there are a few different ways one could interpret this. TT NEWS AGENCY \nSweden, it's absolute carnage there. They're barely the seventh richest country in the world on a GDP per capita basis. Languishing. \nOne which we can immediately dismiss is that Donald Trump just makes up lies off the top of his head because he's an incompetent fraud desperately attempting to deflect attention away from his own shortcomings. Ad Feedback \nThat, obviously, is wrong because as Trump regularly reminds us, he was elected president of the US by the greatest margin in history, once you eliminate the larger number of people that voted for Hillary Clinton. \nThe second possibility, the one Trump is now claiming, is that he was confused by a Fox News interview with filmmaker Ami Horowitz talking about crime in Sweden. TT NEWS AGENCY \nRefugees, who'd want them eh? Oh wait, this is a refugee welcoming parade in Gothenburg, Sweden. \nTo be fair to Trump, it's a rare Fox News story indeed that mentions crime without also implying that it's because of migrants who are terrorists. \nTrump notoriously absorbs huge amounts of the absolutely unbiased Fox News every day, because presidents of the US typically have a lot of downtime during their day when they can just kick back and watch the tube. \nThat's why being president is always referred to as \"the most relaxing job in the world\". \nThe threat of terror is high in Sweden. A trip to any bar is a risk. \nHowever, this obviously can't be the case either because that would imply that Trump makes stupid, easy mistakes because he's as sloppy with his media comprehension as he is with his cabinet picks, his syntax and tying his ties. \nSo we're left with the only explanation that makes sense: that on Friday night Sweden was subject to a terror attack so insidious and catastrophic that no one – not the media, not the people of Sweden, not the very fabric of reality itself – can bring itself to accept. \nHow can we make the leap that Trump did? REUTERS \nWhite House chief of staff Reince Priebus says people should take Trump seriously when he calls the media the \"enemy of the American people.\" \nFirst up, we need to plumb Trump's rich depth of knowledge about foreign countries and his sophisticated insights into the subtleties of international geopolitics. \nWe must, in short, think like Trump and bring all the wisdom of that icily-brilliant intellect to bear. \nSo: as Trump will tell you, Sweden is a bigly country bordered by Finland, England, Iceland, Europe, and New Zealand. \nIt has a population of 10 million translucent people, each of whom has an average of 2.4 Volvos and wears white jumpsuits. \nIt is a constitutional monarchy ruled by a Dancing Queen who feels the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah, and their television is nothing but incomprehensible cooking shows. \nIt suffers from a cripplingly high level of taxation and public spending which has ruined the nation with its creeping socialism. \nSo gutted has Sweden become that it is barely the seventh richest country in the world on a GDP per capita basis, languishing ahead of the US's far superior 10th spot. \nMaybe that horrifying poverty is why Sweden hasn't even been in a war since 1814, the pussies. \nSweden's main exports are herrings, swedes, elves and fjords, and their military is made up entirely of Valkyries. \nAnd this is why they have been woefully unable to stop the attacks on their freedoms by roving bands of vikings from the north and Moomintrolls from the east. \nBut that's not the tragedy which befell the plucky little future Russian satellite republic. \nWhat Trump knows, and what the lamestream media are so shamefully ignoring, is that on Friday night Ragnarök began in Sweden. \nThis might sound melodramatic, but as every scholar of Norse mythology knows – at least, the ones that pre-paid for that elective at Trump University – this marks the horrific End of the Days in which Norse gods including Odin, Loki, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson and Ant-Man do final battle before being eventually engulfed by the Kraken, at which point Putin moves in his forces for… let's say \"peacekeeping\". \nTragically, however, not even the sequin-festooned people of Sweden will know of their fate, trapped as they are by the Tryckfrihetsförordningen, or Freedom of the Press Act which ensures that government cannot interfere in the operation of the media. \nAnd we all know what letting media fearlessly operate without direct government oversight means: fake news! \nSo thank you, President Donald \"Definitely Sane\" Trump, for having the guts to once again take time out of what is evidently a pretty cruisy sort of an official schedule to yell fresh insights at the less discerning people of Florida. \nAfter all, why should reality have a monopoly on truth?
