The increase in demand is due to a surfeit of new passports that were issued in 2007 following the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative , which made it necessary for U.S. citizens returning from Canada and Mexico to show a passport. Ten years later, all of those passports are expiring.\n There's also an increase in first-time passport applications thanks to the Real ID Act , which requires residents of certain states to show an alternative form of identification, such as a passport, for air travel; it goes into effect on January 22, 2018.\nThe State Department recommends renewing your passport within nine months of its expiration date, according to USA Today . What's more, there are at least 50 countries — including the Bahamas, Jamaica, Mexico, and Thailand — that require U.S. citizens to have six months or more left on their passport to travel there.\nCurrent passport holders can renew by mail , or in person with first-time applicants.\n(h/t Huffington Post )\nFrom: Country Living\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.countryliving.com/life/travel/news/a40995/tsa-realid-driver-license-rules/", "http://traveltips.usatoday.com/soon-can-renew-expiring-passport-33623.html", "https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/western-hemisphere-travel-initiative", "https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/passports/applyinperson.html", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-passport-2016_us_56a90419e4b0f7179928ae78?te=AT", "http://lifehacker.com/these-countries-follow-the-six-month-rule-for-passpor-1782577451", "http://www.countryliving.com/life/travel/news/a41571/renew-expiring-passports-now/", "https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/passports/renew.html", "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/travel/passport-renewal.html?"], "published": "2017-02-04T12:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T03:30:53.686+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
