Credit U.C. Merced When reporters are writing about private individuals they don’t typically publish the person’s exact street address. First, it’s usually irrelevant to the article, and more crucially, announcing the home address of anyone can be dangerous. Here’s the guidance from The New York Times stylebook: “In writing about a person whose family might face harassment or harm, consider a general neighborhood reference instead. If an exact address seems newsworthy because of a crime or other visible event, carefully consider the potential for harm before publishing it.” That wasn’t the approach taken when the Times reporter Patricia Leigh Brown described academic life for some undocumented students on the campus of the University of California, Merced. The 22 students, mostly first-generation immigrants from impoverished families, share life together on the top two floors of a single dorm. And each time Brown described a student, she included their dorm room number, adding some visual geography as she described their modestly decorated surroundings. Brown writes an engaging piece, not only about these students’ unlikely path to a campus of an acclaimed university, but also about education policy, which is not always easy to make engaging. Brown shows it’s possible. It’s too bad that an otherwise strong piece was weakened by a decision to describe the students not just by their name, but by what is essentially their home address. Two university administrators I contacted, both of whom were involved with The Times’s story, said they believe that inclusion of the dorm name and room numbers puts the undocumented students in danger. \nAdvertisement   “We didn’t think she (the reporter) would even use the name of the residence hall,” said Alejandro Delgadillo, who oversees services for undocumented students on the campus. “To include the room numbers puts a target on these students. We engage with a great deal of media and never felt that students were at risk by the information that we were sharing. This really violated that.” Charles Nies, the interim vice chancellor for student affairs, said one can look no further than the comments on the story to see the animosity directed toward this group. He’s right. Here’s one commenter who goes by “The cat in the hat”: “My neighbor’s spending 50k a year to send her daughter to college. But don’t worry, Mexicans. I’m sure she’ll be happy to spend another 50k of her own hard earned money so you that undocumented saints can have one as well!” Several college professors wrote in, as did many Times readers. Lali DeRosier from Melbourne, Fla. wrote: \nI am shocked and dismayed that the piece identifies undocumented students, and that it made public their dormitory building and room numbers. This is sensitive information that should have been protected. By publishing this information, you have put these students at great risk, especially given the attitude of the current administration to undocumented people. All of of the students in the piece agreed to the use of their names, and those who were photographed signed a release. The students also gave their dorm numbers, but according to Delgadillo, they did not realize the reporter was going to use them in the story. The reporter told me that she now regrets the decision. “I am a mother myself and the last thing I’d want to do is jeopardize any student’s safety or give them cause for alarm,” said Brown. “In hindsight, understanding that the room numbers seem to have caused distress and concern, I, of course, would not have used them. I gave the students the option of not using their full names (none of them took it) and did ask for their room numbers, even double-checking them with some.” Jane Karr, an education editor at The Times, said she is comfortable with the decision to publish the dorm numbers and does not believe that they are putting the students in danger. “Having a room number did not give you more access to the students,” she said. “It’s a secure building.” Phil Corbett, associate managing editor for standards, said he too understood the decision to use the dorm address, saying that, while The Times doesn’t want to create unwarranted risk, the details are what make a narrative compelling. Sometimes that’s true. But in this case, the dorm numbers were not make-or-break details. Since the students agreed to give their names, and signed a release for the use of their image, then I think The Times is certainly within good journalistic standards to use them. But saying who lives behind which door seems like an unecessary intrusion that didn’t help the students or the story. \nFollow the public editor on Twitter @spaydl and reach her by email at .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T17:03:25.289+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
