(Photo: Jerome Miron, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nNEW ORLEANS – Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban has been an outspoken critic of some of President Trump’s policies and behavior. The two have battled on Twitter. \nOn Twitter on Thursday, Cuban wrote, “It’s a waste of time to try to turn Pinocchio into a real President. The focus needs to be on the Geppettos and legislators around him.” It's a waste of time to try to turn Pinocchio into a real President. The focus needs to be on the Geppettos and legislators around him — Mark Cuban (@mcuban) February 16, 2017 \nTo demonstrate the issues he has with Trump, Cuban will wear No. 46 at Friday’s NBA All-Star Celebrity Game (7 p.m. ET, ESPN) – a direct reference to Trump being the 45th president and that someone else – perhaps even Cuban – should be the 46th president, according to a person with knowledge of Cuban's decision. \nThe person spoke under the condition of anonymity because Cuban had not made the reasoning behind the decision public. \nBefore Cuban’s tweet on Thursday, Trump slammed Cuban on Twitter: “I know Mark Cuban well. He backed me big-time but I wasn’t interested in taking all of his calls. He’s not smart enough to run for president!\" Facebook A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
