But in addition to thanking God, his parents, and Chicago, he did offer a shout-out to SoundCloud . That's because Chance doesn't have a label deal, nor did he sell any physical copies of his album Coloring Book, a historic first for the Grammys . \nInstead, as Quartz explains , he makes his music available online, often for free, and focuses on making money from touring and merchandising. In that respect, he's the opposite of Prince, who was famously anti-streaming (and whose music posthumously landed on streaming services yesterday). At the same time, Chance has turned down major label deals in favor of maintaining total control over his music. You can't help but think that Prince, who was honored at the Grammys last night, would have appreciated that. \n[Photo: Kevin Winter/Getty Images for NARAS] JPT Mexico to Silicon Valley: We welcome everyone \nThis week, Aristóteles Sandoval, governor of the Mexican state of Jalisco, said he is flying to Silicon Valley to meet with 30-40 startups and 12 tech companies—as well as California governor Jerry Brown —in an effort to draw talent down to his region. He says Jalisco could be a helpful refuge in the wake of President Trump's travel ban. \n\"For some of them, we will discuss their plans to increase operations,\" says Sandoval through a translator, adding that he'll also be talking to companies considering Jalisco, \"just in case things are getting difficult with the Trump administration.\" \nThe visit comes days after Sandoval published an open letter to Silicon Valley in Politico touting Mexico's research and development resources and friendly immigration rules.

After making the rounds on Sunday talk shows yesterday, the onetime presidential candidate came out swinging today against Marathon Pharmaceuticals, which recently set the price of a decades-old steroid treatment to $89,000 a year. The drug is widely available for about $1,000 a year in Canada and Europe, but was recently approved in the United States to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a rare disease. \nSanders released a joint statement with Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, accusing the drug company of abusing the \"orphan drug\" program , which in designed to encourage research into rare diseases by giving companies market exclusivity on drugs for seven years. \n\"Marathon's apparent abuse of government-granted exclusivity periods and incentives to sell what should be a widely available drug for $89,000 a year is unconscionable … Exorbitantly pricing potentially life-saving medications that should be widely available for a fraction of the price hinders patient access and drives up costs for the entire health care sector.\" \nRead the full release here .
