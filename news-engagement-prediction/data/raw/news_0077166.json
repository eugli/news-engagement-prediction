Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP This year's Oscars was set up to be a politically charged night but it was brands, not actors, who made the biggest statements.\nThe awards show is the second biggest live television event in the United States, after the Super Bowl. This year, brands paid up to $2.1 million for a 30-second spot during the film industry's biggest annual event, according to Variety , \nFrom uniting the nation, to championing women, these were the most politically charged ads from the 2017 Oscars. 1. Cadillac - \"Carry\" YouTube \nThe automotive brand aired four ads during the Oscars but its most powerful one called on people to unite a divided nation. \nThe ad included footage of Mohammed Ali, Marilyn Monroe, and Dwight Eisenhower to show how different people have the power to unite the country. 2. GE - \"Millie Dresselhaus\" Star of GE's Oscars ad, scientist Mildred Dresselhaus, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Alex Wong/Getty Images \nGE's Oscars ad called for more women in engineering roles. \nThe theme of the ad echoes Audi's Super Bowl commercial, which called for gender pay equality , but takes on a more fun approach by asking what would happen if scientist Mildred Dresselhaus was treated as a celebrity. \nThe scientist, who was known as the \"Queen of Carbon\" thanks to her research into the properties of the chemical element, died two days before the awards ceremony at the age of 86 . 3. Hyatt - \"For a world of understanding\" YouTube \nTo the tune of the well-known Burt Bacharach song \"What the world needs now is love,\" Hyatt highlighted human connections across different cultures. \nThe ad opened with a Muslim woman and then ran through different scenarios of people from different cultures traveling around the world and forming friendships, before ending on the tagline: \"For a world of understanding.\" \nThe commercial is part of Hyatt's new brand platform \"World of Hyatt.\" 4. Audible - \"1984\" Star Trek actor Zachary Quinto was the star of Audible's Oscars ad. Gregory Bull/AP Images \nAmazon-owned ebook company Audible went with a sober ad, with a quote from George Orwell's 1984. \nThe star of the ad, \"Star Trek\" actor Zachary Quinto, reads out the quote: \"If he were allowed contact with foreigners he would discover that they are creatures similar to himself and that most of what he has been told about them is lies. The sealed world in which he lives would be broken, and the fear, hatred, and self-righteousness on which his morale depends might evaporate.\" \nUsers on Twitter came out in support of the commercial's message: 5. New York Times - \"The truth is...\" YouTube \nThe newspaper used the Oscars to launch its first brand campaign in over a decade and it didn't shy away from confrontation. \nThe minimalistic ad describes the different definitions of truth to show the difficulty and importance of the NY Times' reporting. \nThe ad even got a reaction from US President Trump, who has frequently labeled the newspaper as part of the \" fake news media .\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T22:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T17:37:40.866+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
