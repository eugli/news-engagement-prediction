Advertisement Advertisement \nWhile waiting for my always-late dinner date at the convivially crowded bar at the newly-reopened Union Square Café in NYC one night last week, I decided to order a glass of wine, of course. But because I never, ever order from the by-the-glass list—by-the-glass bottles typically represent the highest profit margins for restaurants and the worst values for customers—I asked for the full wine list and ordered a whole bottle. In what seemed like two minutes, a voice very close to my ear announced in a low voice, “Domaine Jamet, Côtes du Rhône Blanc 2014.” \nThere, just behind me, stood sommelier Chris Struck, as if he’d just apparated up from the cellar to within inches of my shoulder. Despite being elbow to elbow with fellow imbibers, Struck comported himself with full-regulation sommelier aplomb, holding the bottle label-side up in one hand while pointing to producer name and vintage with the other. Then he flicked open the blade of his wine opener and made three swift, smooth swipes, cutting the foil capsule below the second lip of the bottle, then pulling off the cap and putting it in his pocket. \nThat’s when a guy nearby offered this unsolicited quip: “Steady hands—he’d make a great mohel!” That made me recall a hilarious vintage Saturday Night Live fake commercial for the 1978 Royal Deluxe II , in which a mohel performs a flawless circumcision as the car goes over potholes, proving the vehicle has perfect suspension. But it also got me thinking about the party my wife and I threw this past New Year’s Eve, and how all thirty guests seemed to arrive within five minutes of each other. As is my duty, I began offering glasses of wine as fast as I could pour them, pulling entire foil capsules off the bottles with one swift yank, or, for stickier ones, slashing them from bottom to top and then ripping them off quickly. More than one guest asked, “Can you actually do that?” as if I’d broken a sacred rule. Guess what: When it comes to wine, there are no sacred rules.
