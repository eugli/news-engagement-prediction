Shear and Ron Nixon New York Times February 21, 2017\nWASHINGTON — President Trump has directed his administration to enforce the nation’s immigration laws more aggressively, unleashing the full force of the federal government to find, arrest, and deport those in the country illegally, regardless of whether they have committed serious crimes.\nDocuments released Tuesday by the Department of Homeland Security revealed the broad scope of the president’s ambitions: to publicize crimes by undocumented immigrants; strip such immigrants of privacy protections; enlist local police officers as enforcers; erect new detention facilities; discourage asylum seekers; and, ultimately, speed up deportations.\nAdvertisement\nThe new enforcement policies put into practice language that Trump used on the campaign trail, vastly expanding the definition of “criminal aliens” and warning that such unauthorized immigrants “routinely victimize Americans,” disregard the “rule of law, and pose a threat” to people across the United States.\nDespite those assertions in the new documents, research shows lower levels of crime among immigrants than among native-born Americans.\nGet Ground Game in your inbox: Daily updates and analysis on national politics from James Pindell.

Bush and their predecessors, who sought to balance protecting the nation’s borders with fiscal, logistical, and humanitarian limits on the exercise of laws passed by Congress.\n“The faithful execution of our immigration laws is best achieved by using all these statutory authorities to the greatest extent practicable,” John F. Kelly, the secretary of homeland security, wrote in one of two memorandums released Tuesday. “Accordingly, department personnel shall make full use of these authorities.”\nAdvertisement\nThe immediate impact of that shift is not yet fully known. Advocates for immigrants warned Tuesday that the new border control and enforcement directives would create an atmosphere of fear that was likely to drive those in the country illegally deeper into the shadows.\nAdministration officials said some of the new policies — like one seeking to send unauthorized border crossers from Central America to Mexico while they await deportation hearings — could take months to put in effect and might be limited in scope.\nFor now, so-called Dreamers, who were brought to the United States as young children, will not be targeted unless they commit crimes, officials said Tuesday.\nTrump has not yet said where he will get the billions of dollars needed to pay for thousands of new border control agents, a network of detention facilities, and a wall along the entire southern border with Mexico.\nBut politically, Kelly’s actions Tuesday serve to reinforce the president’s standing among a core constituency — those who blame unauthorized immigrants for taking jobs away from citizens, committing heinous crimes, and being a financial burden on federal, state, and local governments.\nAnd because of the changes, millions of immigrants in the country illegally now face a far greater likelihood of being discovered, arrested, and eventually deported.\n“The message is: The immigration law is back in business,” said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports restricted immigration. “That violating immigration law is no longer a secondary offense.”\nLawyers and advocates for immigrants said the new policies could still be challenged in court.\n“When you tell state and local police that their job is to do immigration enforcement,” said Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, “it translates into the unwarranted and illegal targeting of people because of their race, because of their language, because of the color of their skin.”\nSean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said Tuesday that the president wanted to “take the shackles off” of the nation’s immigration enforcers. He insisted that the new policies made it clear that “the No. 1 priority is that people who pose a threat to our country are immediately dealt with.”\nIn fact, that was already the policy under the Obama administration, which instructed agents that undocumented immigrants convicted of serious crimes were the priority for deportation. Now, enforcement officials have been directed to seek the deportation of anyone in the country illegally.\nThe policy also expands a program that lets officials bypass due process protections such as court hearings in some deportation cases.\nUnder the Obama administration, the program, known as “expedited removal,” was used only when an immigrant was arrested within 100 miles of the border and had been in the country for no more than 14 days. Now it will include all those who have been in the country for as long as two years, no matter where they are caught.\n“The administration seems to be putting its foot down as far as the gas pedal will go,” said Heidi Altman, policy director for the National Immigrant Justice Center, a Chicago-based group that offers legal services to immigrants.\nIn the documents released Tuesday, the Department of Homeland Security is directed to begin the process of hiring 10,000 immigration and customs agents, expanding the number of detention facilities, and creating an office within Immigration and Customs Enforcement to help families of those killed by undocumented immigrants.\nRelated A close at Trump’s new immigration policies", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fnation%2F2017%2F02%2F21%2Fnew-trump-deportation-rules-allow-far-more-expulsions%2F7EXP6S92pzEh7CpsYTON3K%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%3Fevent%3Devent25&tTrump", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fnation%2F2017%2F02%2F21%2Fnew-trump-deportation-rules-allow-far-more-expulsions%2F7EXP6S92pzEh7CpsYTON3K%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&t=Trump", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Trump", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fnation%2F2017%2F02%2F21%2Fnew-trump-deportation-rules-allow-far-more-expulsions%2F7EXP6S92pzEh7CpsYTON3K%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%26s_campaign%3dsm_gp%26hl=en-US", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fnation%2F2017%2F02%2F21%2Fnew-trump-deportation-rules-allow-far-more-expulsions%2F7EXP6S92pzEh7CpsYTON3K%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&title=Trump"], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T08:07:01.589+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
