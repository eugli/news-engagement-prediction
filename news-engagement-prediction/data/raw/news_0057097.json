Tracy McCreery, D-Olivette, said Missouri’s two largest airports were out of step with others in the nation that allow people to roam the concourse with their booze. \n“It makes us seem a little old-fashioned,” McCreery said. \nRep. Alan Green, D-Florissant, said it would help travelers who are in a rush to get a drink and then return to their gate. \nBut Rep. Stacey Newman, D-Clayton, said lawmakers should not be encouraging more alcohol consumption among passengers. \n“Having intoxicated passengers at 30,000 feet when there is nothing you can do? As a crew member this is everyone’s worst nightmare,” said Newman, a former flight crew member for TWA. \n“It might sound great for passenger convenience,” Newman said. “We have enough situations now with unruly passengers. This, I believe, does not do anything to help those kinds of situations.” \nSt. Louis Lambert International Airport is in favor of the law change, spokesman Jeff Lea said. The airport has heard from passengers who say that they want to be able to take their drinks with them to their gates, and that many other airports already allow it. \nHe also said that there were times when people wouldn’t buy a drink because an airport bar is too far from their gates, and that allowing drinks to be taken out of bars could mean increased concession revenue. \nThe responsibility remains with bars as to whether to serve a passenger who may have had too much to drink, Lea said. \nUnder the proposal, which is sponsored by Rep. Noel Shull, R-Liberty, the drinks must be in containers that display the retailer’s name or logo. \nA similar measure was debated by the House and Senate in 2016, but the legislation failed to win final approval. \nThe legislation is House Bill 115. \nLeah Thorsen of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.
