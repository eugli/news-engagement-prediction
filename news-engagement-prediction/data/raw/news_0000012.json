Podcast: James Hook on Wales in the Six Nations \nHowley has taken charge of Wales while Gatland prepares to lead the British and Irish Lions this summer. \nThat was also the case in 2013, when Howley guided Wales to the title as Gatland prepared for the Lions' 2-1 Test series win over Australia. \nHook said: \"Dan played against Argentina and South Africa [in November 2016] and got those vital wins, which was severely needed.\" \nBut he added he expected Davis, 23, to push 27-year-old Biggar \"an awful lot over the next couple of years\". Wales in the 2017 Six Nations Sunday, 5 February, 14:00 GMT, Stadio Olimpico: Italy v Wales Saturday, 11 February, 16:50 GMT, Principality Stadium: Wales v England Saturday, 25 February, 14:25 GMT, Murrayfield: Scotland v Wales Friday, 10 March, 20:05 GMT, Principality Stadium: Wales v Ireland Saturday, 18 March, 14:45 GMT, Stade d France: France v Wales \nHook expects Biggar and Davies' Ospreys half-back partner Rhys Webb to return after recovering from an ankle injury. \nWales must also plug the gap left by Bath lock Luke Charteris' hand injury, while his club-mate Taulupe Faletau is a major doubt. \nHook said: \"Webb, I think, will come in after his injury, but I don't think there'll be any left-field selections. \n\"I think it pretty much picks itself, really, apart from Luke Charteris being out, which will be a big loss and Toby looks like he won't recover either.\" \nScarlets' Jake Ball is the leading contender to play alongside captain Alun Wyn Jones at lock while Ross Moriarty is expected to continue at number eight if Faletau's absence is confirmed. \nItaly coach Conor O'Shea announced his line-up on Wednesday, making five changes from the team that beat South Africa in November. \nThere has also been debate over who should start at full-back - Liam Williams or Leigh Halfpenny - while former captain Sam Warburton may be at blind-side flanker with Justin Tipuric staying in the seven jersey.
