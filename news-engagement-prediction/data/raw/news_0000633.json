There, his head was bandaged but he left before a brain scan. Hours later he was forced to return to hospital because he was suffering from headaches and vomiting. \nA brain scan then revealed a ‘severe head injury’ - prosecutor Tim Greenald said - comprising a three separate bleeds on the brain and two bruises. The victim, who also suffered two fractured front teeth, was a hospital in-patient for ten days. \nMr Greenald said the attack had a physical and emotional impact on the victim. \n“He refers to ongoing affects on his memory and talks about some nights where he loses sleep due to thinking about the attack and the investigation”, the prosecutor added.

He’s not someone who goes out looking for trouble or responds inappropriately to stressful situations, either socially or in his work - the phrase gentle giant is used by those who know him. \n\"He’s a peacekeeper, likely to defuse situations rather than inflame them.” \nHanding him an eight month sentence suspended for a year, and an order to compensate the victim £2,000, Judge Patrick Field QC told Bloomer: “It’s without doubt that you are a young man of considerable potential - you are highly thought thought by your peers. It was but a single blow, a blow undoubtedly delivered with the skill of a boxer, thus a calculated blow and one that was part of a wholly disproportionate display of belligerence. \n“That blow was sufficiently hard to break the victim’s front teeth and knock him to the ground, his head striking the ground with sufficient force to render him unconscious. Let’s be frank - this is the sort of blow that in similar circumstances could have caused a man’s death.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T15:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T11:10:42.064+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
