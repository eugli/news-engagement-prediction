Christ Church Cathedral campaigners ask Bruce Springsteen for help CHARLIE GATES Last updated 17:24, February 8 2017 FAIRFAX NZ \nBruce Springsteen performs live on stage with the E Street Band at Auckland's Mount Smart Stadium in 2014. \nHeritage campaigners want Bruce Springsteen to help launch a fundraising drive to restore the Christ Church Cathedral. \nGreat Christchurch Buildings Trust co-chairman Jim Anderton plans to ask The Boss to perform a song in front of the cathedral when he is in the city for a concert on February 21 at AMI Stadium. \nAnderton said he hoped a decision on the future of the cathedral would be released by February 20. The trust then plans to launch a fundraising campaign to support restoration of the earthquake-damaged building. IAIN MCGREGOR/FAIRFAX NZ \nThe Christ Church Cathedral has been sitting derelict and open to the elements in the city centre for nearly six years. \nThe Government is in talks with the Anglican diocese over a deal to restore the cathedral. \nREAD MORE: \nIt was understood a working party appointed by the Government last year recommended the cathedral restoration could be funded with the Anglican's insurance payout, Government funding and private donations. IAIN MCGREGOR/FAIRFAX NZ \nA chess player in front of the earthquake-damaged Christ Church Cathedral. A decision on the future of the building is yet to be made. \nAnderton said he hoped to approach concert promoters before Springsteen's arrival in Christchurch. \n\"We are hopeful that he might be able to do something special when he comes. It would be a good launch to a fundraising campaign if the decision is positive.\" \nAnderton wrote to Springsteen personally in 2013 asking him to perform in Christchurch as a possible fundraiser for restoration of the cathedral. \nThe letter was part of a local campaign to persuade Springsteen to perform in Christchurch when he came to New Zealand in 2014. Ad Feedback \nThe campaign was unsuccessful, with Springsteen performing only in Auckland in 2014. He did, however, dedicate his song My Hometown to Christchurch during the Auckland gig. \nA spokeswoman for the concert's promoter said they had received hundreds of requests from charities and organisations ahead of the Christchurch gig. \nAnderton said he was confident there would be an announcement on the cathedral soon, despite repeated delays on a decision for the building. \n\"I think the Government has got it under control. I would be surprised if they haven't. They don't want another year like this, that is for sure.\" \nHe said the restoration deal may involve the Government helping with funding. \n\"The Government was always going to have money in the deal. The question is how much and under what circumstances and I imagine that is some of the stuff that is being worked through now.\" \nA spokeswoman for Greater Christchurch Regeneration Minister Gerry Brownlee did not answer questions on the cathedral. \nA spokesman for the Anglican diocese said there was \"nothing to report at this stage\". - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T11:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T07:04:36.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
