While accepting the award for Album of the Year, she thanked many close to her including her \"husband\" Simon. The singer was also sporting a ring while inside the Staples Center. \nWhile very few details are known about Adele and Simon's special day, one guest of the couples' nuptials is for certain…their son Angelo . Photos \nAdele's Best Looks Kevin Winter/Getty Images for NARAS \nThe 28-year-old British star has recently completed her sold-out world tour and she took to the stage to joke about what she was planning to do on her time off. \n\"My son is about to turn 4 very, very soon. I'm starting to get very emotional about it because I feel like once they turn 4, they're not really your actual baby anymore. So my womb is starting to ache a little bit. ‘Baby, baby, baby, need a baby, need a baby.'\" \nShe later clarified to the audience at Nashville's Bridgestone Arena, \"I'm not pregnant. I won't get pregnant until the end of the tour.\" \nAnd speaking of the end of the tour, Adele hopped on social media to thank everyone for all of their hard work during the grueling months on the road. \n\"I just finished my 107 shows in 10 months. 100 percent live every night. I bloody smashed it, even if I do say so myself. You lot have been incredible, every night you've been so beautiful, loving and engaged,\" she wrote back in November. \n\"My band and my crew you made the whole thing turn and my beautiful family made it easy for me to do.\" \nCongratulations to the newlyweds on the exciting family news!
