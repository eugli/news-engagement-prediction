'I think they are a little jealous,' she said as stroked another gentle pooch, Daisy, who was waiting to greet her too The Old Windsor site, which has been operation since 1979, cares fro around 100 dogs and 50 cats at any one time. It has its own on-site clinic and a small team of vets and nurses. Camilla's Jack Russells jumped up at TV star Amanda, right, and almost dragged the royal out of an official photocall - as she was announced as the organisation's Patron The Duchess' visit comes as she was announced as the world famous rescue organisation's new Royal Patron, following the Queen's decision to step down from the role last year Camilla wrapped up in a grey check coat dress and a printed monochrome scarf, teaming her outfit with a pair of black suede shoes which she wore in Bath the day before Showing off: Beth almost faultlessly completed a dog agility course for the first time, after which she and Bluebell were rewarded by their royal mistress with some delicious treats Most pets find a new home after around 30 days but Mabel a two-year-old mongrel, has been there since April last year and is desperately looking for a loving new owner. First up was Willow, a four-year-old cocker spaniel who was found tied to the gates of the home in a pitiful state. Vet Paul Dobson described her as the worst case he had ever seen - she had bleeding and infected skin, hair loss, puss filled eyes and had been clearly bred from repeatedly. Thanks to Battersea's round-the-clock care she has now finally been re-homed. 'Oh your poor thing, ' said Camilla, stroking her ears, 'no sign of her puppies or papers? Look at her now, though. It just goes to show that a little bit of TLC does miracles, doesn't it?' Camilla greets a pooch before heading inside. She donned a smart black and white check coat dress, wrapping up against the winter chill with a pair of leather gloves and printed scarf The royal heads inside to meet dogs being cared for by the centre including Willow, pictured. Camilla, an avid animal lover, has made several visits to the charity over the years Camilla also recalled how one of her dogs had been brought into the Old Windsor site for treatment before it was re-homed with her. The Duchess also got to meet Brody, a hugely friendly black Labrador, who loves children but suffers from a form of arthritis, and Duke, an 18-month-old Border Collie stray called Duke. She also met with one of the feline residents, Luna, a nine-month-old cat, and was suitably impressed by her luxury bed which had Buckingham Palace written on it. Reunited with her own dogs, Camilla brought the youngest, Bluebell, in for a photocall with some of the home's celebrity supporters, supermodel David Gandy and actress and presenter Amanda Holden. Down boy! Camilla meets a Labrador named Brody during her visit as she is announced as royal patron of Battersea Dogs & Cats Home Amanda greeted the Duchess warmly and told her how she had rehomed a Battersea Shih Tzu dog, Alfie, with her parents. The couple, who lost their previous dog, a Labrador, five years previously, had vowed never to get another pet - but she brought Alfie down as a surprise to their home in Cornwall and he has never left. 'How wonderful,' Camilla said. Gandy asked her how she had enjoyed her first tour of the Old Windsor centre, to which Camilla replied: 'These visits are rather fatal as you always want to come back with something.' Bluebell was then invited to join her for the photocall but got terribly overexcited by the sight of her owner - and the cameras. BATTERSEA'S NEW ROYAL PATRON Camilla during a 2012 visit to Battersea Dog and Cats Home in London The Duchess of Cornwall’s relationship with Battersea stretches back to October 2010, when she visited the charity’s south London centre to open its new state-of-the-art cattery in its 150th anniversary year. A huge animal-lover and supporter of rescue dogs, she chose Battersea when she re-homed two Jack Russell Terriers - Beth in August 2011 and Bluebell in September 2012. The Duchess returned to Battersea in 2012, accompanied by Beth and Bluebell, when she met the dogs in the charity’s care, alongside Battersea Ambassador Paul O’Grady. The Duchess’s most recent visit to Battersea’s London centre was in September 2016 when she opened the charity’s new Veterinary Hospital and Centre of Excellence. With her tail wagging nineteen to the dozen she sniffed David Gandy and jumped up at Amanda Holden before dragging laughing Camilla out of the shot. Outside Beth was, however, on her best behaviour as Battersea's head of dog behaviour, Ali Taylor, put the little dog through her paces on an agility course. Beth trotted through a tunnel, nipped through a slalom and even managed, with her little legs flying, to jump over a hurdle, before racing to be reunited with her 'mum'. Proud Camilla ruffled her fur delightedly before giving Beth and Bluebell some treats each after first firmly making the pups calm down with a stern 'sit' (although Bluebell did jump up on her owner's coat with some very muddy paws). Asked by Mail Online as she left whether she fancied adding to her pack with a third, Camilla laughed and said: I don't think these two would like that very much. But aren't you tempted?!'
