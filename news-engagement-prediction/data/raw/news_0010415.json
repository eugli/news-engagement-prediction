She said sometimes \"it's hard to feel safe\" as a hijab-wearing Muslim woman.\n\"I was talking to my mother and we were talking about communicating more about where I am and how long I'm going for, because we really need to take safety seriously.\"\nVigils held across Nova Scotia in wake of Quebec mosque attack", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T17:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:11:31.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
