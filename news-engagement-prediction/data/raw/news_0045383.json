(AFP/Getty Images) \nNew Zealand made 207-7 after heavy rain over the past three days had forced a delay of more than three hours and reduced the match to 34-overs-a-side. \n“It was really tough out there,” De Villiers said. “The wicket turned so much in the evening. I thought it would skid on and get a bit flatter. \n“From past experience this becomes a good batting track in the evening and this was far from it. \n“I’ve never seen a wicket turn so much in my life.” \nNew Zealand struggled for much of their innings particularly up front against tight bowling from Morris, who took the first four wickets as the hosts slumped to 82-4 in the 16th over. \nBut Morris, who had figures of 4-24 from his first five overs, was then taken apart by Colin de Grandhomme (34 not out) and Southee (24 not out) in his final two. \nDe Grandhomme and Southee blasted 51 runs from 23 balls, including smashing 38 runs from Morris’s final 12 deliveries to blow out his figures to 4-62 from seven overs. \n“Bit of a shame really. We got ourselves into a good position but credit to South Africa, they adapted really well,” said New Zealand captain Kane Williamson, who top-scored for his side with 59. \n“We weren’t perfect with the bat but we felt that 5-1/2 a half an over would be tough to get on that surface and we had enough to make life difficult.” \nThe second match is in Christchurch on Wednesday. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T23:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T12:13:24.051+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
