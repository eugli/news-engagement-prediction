Maglinte   February 2, 2017 - 12:00am \nCEBU, Philippines - Cebuano Brazilian jiujitsu fighter Edman Pole made his fellow countrymen proud after bagging gold and silver medals in the 2017 Abu Dhabi Grand Slam Jiujitsu Tour in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. \n\"For me, joining the event and competing against world class athletes is already an achievement. I trained hard while working here in Dubai but I had low expectations that is why I am so overwhelmed right now. I dedicate this to the Cebuano jiujitsu community who gave their support since I started at this sport,\" said Pole, who is now based in Dubai and trained under Team Nogueira Fighting Club. \nPerforming more than what was expected of him, the purple-belter Pole clinched gold medal in the 64 kgs. division of the NoGI event after defeating Saudi Arabia's Mohammed Al Ajmi in the finals. He settled for the silver medal in the GI event after losing on points to Mohamed Abuidress of Bahrain. \nThere were few Pinoys who took part in the tournament. Pole and his younger brother Mandave were the only entries from Cebu. Mandave won silver medal in the NoGi event of the blue-belt class. \nPole is now gearing up for bigger tournaments this year including the World Championships. \"I am just living my jiujitsu dream right now. I hope to learn more from this journey and I also plan of someday sharing my skills to young Cebuano BJJ practitioners,\" he added.
