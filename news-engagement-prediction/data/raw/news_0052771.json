For every 10,000 people employed, South Korea employs 347 robots, Japan, with its thriving robotics industry, employs 339 and Germany, Europe’s most prosperous nation, employs 261. \nThe electronics industry, metal industry, and the chemical, plastics and rubber industry are the main drivers of the growth in demand. \nOnly one other Asian country - Taiwan - made it to the list of top 10 nations with the greatest robot density, but China is fast catching up. By way of sheer numbers, the country has dominated the market for robots since 2013 and significantly expanded its leading position with a share of 27% of the total supply in 2015. What’s more, its government aims for the big leagues, recently announcing its intention to increase its domestic production to 100,000 robots in the next three years as well as to boost its density from the present 36 to 150. \nAs for India, robot sales slightly decreased to about 2,100 units in 2015, the report said. The level of industrial automation in the country remains at a miniscule level compared with the US or Japan, but when other kinds of robotics applications - such as smartphones with artificial intelligence (AI) - are taken into account, India ranks as one of the fastest growing and most exciting markets in the world. Last year, Panasonic India announced that it would spend $10 million to develop technology to integrate AI with its handsets.
