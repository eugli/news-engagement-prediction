(Al Bello/Getty Images) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Tuesday, February 21, 2017, 10:45 AM \nDarrelle Revis was bathing in delusion and past glory the day before a sketchy late-night street fight in Pittsburgh thrusted him into the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. \nThe Jets fading cornerback had plenty to say on his verified Instagram account on Feb. 11, including sad and pathetic claims of superiority that revealed that the poor (rich) guy has way too much time on his hands. \nRevis, Inc., might have crafted a pristine image of the man for the past decade, but the mercurial, entitled player has proven to be nothing more than a former great unable to come to grips with his new reality. This guy takes criticism about as well as the guy taking up (part-time) residence on 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. \nA year after Revis claimed that he was hacked in the wake of a profane Instagram flurry on @revisislandtwo4, his official account, directed at Tom Brady, Bill Belichick and Patriots fans, the cornerback shared his all-time cornerback totem pole with some critical posters. \n“(Rod and/or Charles) Woodson, ty (Law), or champ (bailey) has done what I’ve done period,” Revis posted on his verified account. “I had better stats then Deion so know your facts before you start chiming in. But you alongside everybody else tries to judge someone off one season. Look @ the body of work I’ve done in a shorter period of time. Plus Qb feared to even throw my side so clearly that’s why my ints are not in the 50 plus category like some of the guys you previously named.” Darrelle Revis claims he's got better stats than Hall of Famer Deion Sanders. (RANDY PENCH/AP) \nTake a moment to chuckle. \nWait. Give me a little more time. \nOkay. \nRevis has quite the high opinion of himself. Can you imagine Tom Brady ever publicly claiming that he had better numbers than Joe Montana, even though he actually does? Can you envision Barry Sanders trying to marginalize Jim Brown? Or Michael Strahan stacking himself above Deacon Jones? (Via Instagram) \nThe truth is that Revis has little else left. He was a liability last season. He was repeatedly bailed out by poor throws after getting beat in coverage in 2015 even though he called it “one of my best years of my career” during this sad dialogue on Feb. 11. Revis’ only remaining play is to implore folks to check his resume. \nFine. \nSanders was an eight-time Pro Bowler and six-time first-team All Pro. Revis is a seven-time Pro Bowler and four-time first-team All-Pro. \nSanders once won AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year. Revis has never won AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year. (Via Instagram) \nSanders had 53 career interceptions, including nine for touchdowns. Revis has 29 career interceptions, including three for touchdowns. \nSanders won two Super Bowls. Revis has won one. \nEarth to Revis: Quarterbacks feared throwing at Sanders long before you entered the picture. In the NFL cornerback universe, 21 >24. \nIn some ways, I actually feel sorry for Revis, whose public chest-thumping over his legacy is pathetic. His fallback position in the face of criticism is predictable: I’m going to Canton one day. So there! A post shared by Darrelle Revis (@revisislandtwo4) on Feb 11, 2017 at 5:34am PST \nWhen Cleveland Cavaliers guard J.R. Smith tweeted a joke about Revis Island “turning into a tourist resort” in September, the hurt cornerback responded in lame fashion: “still heading to Canton though. What about you???” \nAgain, would Peyton Manning, Calvin Johnson, Brady or any other classy accomplished star ever do that? Obviously not. Revis, however, doesn’t know how else to comport himself. On Feb. 11, he told a critical fan: “See ya @ Canton my dude.” \nIt was so predictable. We get it. You’re going to Canton. Congratulations. You actually deserve it. But please don’t injure your elbow patting yourself on the back. On second thought, it would be a convenient excuse if/when you get beat in coverage next season. I had a sore elbow! \nThere will always be enablers and apologists to prevent Revis from seeing the truth. In his warped world view, past accomplishments should make him immune from fair criticism over his lack of consistent effort.

Poor effort is not. \nAt least Revis appears to understand that he’ll have to play for a lot less money in 2017. He conceded as much in one of his Instagram exchanges 10 days ago. \n“here again bringing up money,” Revis posted to @that_blunted_ninja. “I don't care about being in the top 10 of corners this year. I don't deserve to be. You earn what you get in this league. But when it's all said and done Ill go down as one of the best to ever play the position. It's already happening. You late bro. Haha.” \nOnly $6 million of Revis’ $13 million base salary for 2017 is fully guaranteed. The Jets will have to make a decision whether to keep Revis on a restructured deal (aka- pay cut) or cut him before he’s due a $2 million roster bonus on March 10. His legal entanglements stemming from the Royal Rumble on a Pittsburgh street corner on Feb. 12 certainly don’t help matters. He has a preliminary hearing scheduled for Thursday. Back page of the New York Daily News for February 17, 2017 (New York Daily News) \nRevis insisted on Instagram that he’s “happy about every decision I’ve made in my career & also what I’ve accomplished doing it.” \nHis love for Jets fans has largely been a pre-packaged myth concocted by Revis, Inc. \nThis person loves two things: His family and his money. \nWhen one Jets fan, @c_roditis, questioned Revis on Instagram on Feb. 11 for his inconsistent effort last season, the player quipped: “One less fan ain’t going to change my legacy. That’s why we’ve gave you the label HATERS. So keep hating cause that’s what your good for.” \nRevis later added: “here we have another lame jealous of my success & legacy. They love to hate me. Another hater added to the list! Your welcome for what I’ve done & accomplished in the league. Spoiled a-- fan.” \nRevis’ has 238,000 followers on his verified Instagram account. There are two words on the homepage: “remain humble.” \nHe might want to read that once in a while.
