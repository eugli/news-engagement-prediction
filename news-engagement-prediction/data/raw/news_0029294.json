Email \nLamason said one of the tourists didn't even take off his helmet before running into the water. \n\"It was really cool,\" he said. \nA release from DOC this morning brought welcome news that there had been no further restrandings or Monday night or Tuesday morning. \n\"We're just fully into the clean-up and recovery mode now,\" Lamason said. \n\"There's a dead [whale] that's washed up on Tata Beach so we're pulling that off at high tide. We're putting out the message to people to say there will be quite a few of these things floating around in the bay, and they'll be turning up on beaches.\" \nHe said if people came across whale carcasses they should contact DOC. \n\"I wouldn't get too close to them. The smell is terrible and I wouldn't go touching them that's for sure. When we're working with them we've got gloves on, we've got the full white suits and face shields,\" he said. \nLamason also warned dog-owners walking along the beach that whale meat could make dogs very sick so they should be wary of letting dogs run off where they might come across a carcass. \nHe said the full cost of the whale rescue and recovery was not yet known. \n\"The total cost will not be known until all the carcasses that are still at sea have stopped turning up on beaches,\" Lamason said. \n\"That can often be more expensive than dealing with all the whales one time on Farewell Spit.\" \nThe dead whales on Farewell Spit were moved on Monday with a digger to dunes in an area of the nature reserve that is not open to public walking access. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T06:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:23:38.479+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
