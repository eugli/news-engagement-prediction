It also lowered the economic growth projection by half a percentage point to 7.1 per cent in the first policy review post demonetisation. \n\nThe central bank will hold its next monetary policy meet on February 8. \n\nThe report further noted that the Budget is positive for the medium-term inflation outlook but the pending increase in housing allowances, likely to be implemented from April 2017, is a near-term upside risk to inflation. \n\n\"This is a statistical impact, but higher house rent allowances can add 100-150 bps to headline CPI inflation,\" it said.
