Our country’s so innocent?” he told Fox’s Bill O’Reilly in an excerpt released by the network. The president’s interview was to air Sunday afternoon on the Super Bowl pregame show. \nREAD MORE: Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin agree to cooperate during long-awaited call \nTrump has long expressed a wish for better ties with Moscow, praised Putin and signalled that U.S.-Russia relations could be in line for a makeover, even after U.S. intelligence agencies determined that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to help Trump win against Democrat Hillary Clinton. Putin has called Trump a “very bright and talented man.” \nWATCH: ‘Do you think our country’s so innocent?’ Trump asks O’Reilly \nDuring Putin’s years in power, a number of prominent Russian opposition figures and journalists have been killed. \nIn the interview, Trump says, “I do respect him,” and then is asked why. \n“I respect a lot of people, but that doesn’t mean I’m going to get along with him. He’s a leader of his country. I say it’s better to get along with Russia than not. And if Russia helps us in the fight against ISIS, which is a major fight, and Islamic terrorism all over the world – that’s a good thing,” Trump said, using an acronym for the Islamic State group. “Will I get along with him? I have no idea.” \nREAD MORE: ‘Budding relationship’ between Trump, Putin has potential to slow Doomsday Clock: scientists \nO’Reilly then said about Putin: “But he’s a killer, though. Putin’s a killer.” \nTrump responded: “There are a lot of killers. We’ve got a lot of killers. What do you think? Our country’s so innocent?” \n\nWhen O’Reilly says he doesn’t know any government leaders who are killers, Trump says “take a look at what we’ve done, too. We’ve made a lot of mistakes” and references the Iraq war. \nThe Kremlin had no immediate comment. Democrats and Republicans took issue with Trump’s comparison of Russia and the U.S. \nWATCH: Donald Trump reiterates belief in massive voter fraud in 2016 election despite data \n“I don’t think there’s any comparison,” said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., on ABC’s “This Week.” She added, “I really do resent that he would say something like that.” \nThe Senate’s top Republican, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, distanced himself from the president. \n“Putin’s a former KGB agent. He’s a thug. He was not elected in a way that most people would consider a credible election. The Russians annexed Crimea, invaded Ukraine and messed around in our elections. And no, I don’t think there’s any equivalency between the way the Russians conduct themselves and the way the United States does,” McConnell told CNN’s “State of the Union.” \nREAD MORE: Heroin packets with picture of Donald Trump on them confiscated in drug bust \n\nO’Reilly also asked Trump to back up his claims that some 3 million to 5 million illegal votes were cast in the election. Trump didn’t answer directly, but asserted that immigrants in the U.S. illegally and dead people are on the voter rolls. \n“It’s a really a bad situation, it’s really bad,” Trump said. \nThere is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the Nov. 8 election. Trump won the Electoral College vote but lost the popular vote by nearly 2.9 million votes to Clinton. \nREAD MORE: Donald Trump’s expert on voter fraud registered in 3 states for US election \nTrump recently announced on Twitter that he would call for a “major investigation” into voter fraud, but senior administration officials said last week that plans for Trump to take some type of executive action on the issue had been delayed. \nTrump said in the Fox News interview that he will set up a commission to be headed by Vice President Mike Pence and “we’re going to look at it very, very carefully.” \nWATCH: Trump says he’ll defund California if it becomes a sanctuary for immigrants \nMcConnell, meanwhile, said he saw no role for the federal government because states historically have handled voter fraud investigations. \n“There’s no evidence that it occurred in such a significant number that would have changed the presidential election, and I don’t think we ought to spend any federal money investigating that,” McConnell told CNN. “I think the states can take a look at this issue.” \nOn other issues, Trump said: \n—California’s consideration of legislation to create a statewide sanctuary for people living in the country illegally is “ridiculous” and suggested withholding federal funding as possible punishment. \n—Plans to enact a replacement for the Affordable Care Act could slip into next year. “I would like to say by the end of the year, at least the rudiments, but we should have something within the year and the following year,” Trump said. \nWATCH: Drugs and cartels number one problem in Mexico, Donald Trump says \nThe Trump administration on Thursday revised recent U.S. sanctions that had unintentionally prevented American companies from exporting certain consumer electronic products to Russia. The change allows companies to deal with Russia’s security service, which licenses such exports under Russian law. \nWATCH: Nikki Haley calls suspected Iran missile launch ‘unacceptable’ \nThe products were not intended to be covered by the sanctions the Obama administration imposed on Dec. 29 after U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia interfered in the presidential election. The White House denied it was easing sanctions. \nAlso last week, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley condemned Russia’s “aggressive actions” in eastern Ukraine and warned Moscow that U.S. sanctions imposed after its annexation of Crimea will remain until the peninsula is returned to Ukraine. \nBut she tempered her criticism, saying it was “unfortunate” that she had to condemn Russia in her first appearance at the U.N. Security Council. \n“We do want to better our relations with Russia,” Haley said. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T18:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T05:11:12.439+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
