It’s so scary, all these things coming out of the sea,” she captioned in her local dialect. “What could be the meaning of these appearances? We leave our fate to you, Lord.” ADVERTISEMENT \nNetizens quickly reacted to her post, which has now amassed 29,000 likes and 92,000 shares as of Thursday. \nThis is not an isolated case of dead marine mammals found in coastlines this year. Earlier this month, more than 400 dead whales showed up at Farewell Spit, New Zealand, regarded as one of the worst mass beaching of whales in that country. Burying these carcasses is considered difficult for marine workers as they have to puncture a hole in the body to excrete gas.
