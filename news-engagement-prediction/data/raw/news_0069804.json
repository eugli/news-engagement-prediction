Fadnavis thanked the people again for supporting their agenda of development.\nSpeaking about the close margin of victory in the state, the Chief Minister said that they had lost 20 seats by a very close margin. There was a lot at stake for both Shiv Sena and the BJP, two saffron allies for over 20 years, who have been going through a fallout. Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray had openly criticised the BJP government in the state under Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s demonetisation scheme. For the most part of the day, it looked as if the Shiv Sena would run away with an absolute majority for more time but BJP changed gears towards the end of the day and raced to 81 seats. Although, since none of the parties gained the required 114 seats to reach an absolute majority, the picture still remains unclear as to who will take over the reigns of the richest Municipal corporation in the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:10:05.894+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
