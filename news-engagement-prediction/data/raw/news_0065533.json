Nothing! They make us look and feel older than we are and also make us spend our hard earned money on product after product. Who needs that? \nBut did you know you're probably encouraging your eye wrinkles to multiply or even get deeper? It's true! Check out the 4 most common mistakes people make that gives your eyes those dreaded creases. Start changing your habits today and stop your eye wrinkles in their tracks.

Not Wearing Sunglasses \nI wear glasses, and for the longest time I avoided getting prescription sunglasses because I just didn't want to fork over hundreds of dollars for frames and lenses that would quickly go out of style. Boy did I ever pay the price. Because of the decade of constant squinting, I now have crow's feet as well as forehead wrinkles. I would give anything to turn back the clock and cough up the money from the beginning. \nIf you don't wear sunglasses for whatever reason, you're encouraging wrinkles! Look in the mirror and squint like the sun is in your eyes. See the lines that form? After so long they will become permanent lines. Wrinkles form for different reasons but one reason is repetitive facial movements that over time breakdown collagen and elastin in the skin. This happens each time you squint because you aren't wearing sunglasses. \nGo buy sunglasses and use them year-round. Remember that you also need sunglasses in the winter when the sun is even brighter reflecting off of the snow. If you smoke cigarettes you probably squint through the smoke. This also causes wrinkles around your eyes. \ncontinue reading below our video Wake Up to Younger Looking Eyes 2. Rubbing and Tugging at Your Eyes \nWhat do you do when you're tired? Chances are good you rub your eyes. It's instinct! It feels good to rub your eyes when you're tired or when they are feeling itchy, but it's a habit you must stop today if you want to avoid looking older than you really are. \nThe skin around your eyes is so thin that when you rub them it causes them to wrinkle back and forth. Consistently rubbing them will cause them to wrinkle faster than if you never started the bad habit in the first place. \nThis goes for removing your eye make up as well. Don't remove roughly. Let the makeup dissolve a bit with a cotton swab filled with remover before you rub it off. When you remove eye makeup by tugging at the skin around your eye you breakdown collagen. When you use eyeliner that tugs at the skin around your eyes you are causing further damage to that skin . As for eye creams , apply your ring finger and gently tap in the cream, don't rub it in harshly. 3. Sleeping on Your Stomach \nWhen you sleep on your belly, the side of your face resting on your pillow is squished for hours at a time. By constantly squishing your face each night, you are causing creasing which can eventually turn into wrinkles. (Notice sleep lines each morning?) \nTry falling to sleep on your back. If you find it hard to stay that way, put a pillow under your knees, which will help you stay in place. \nCan't imagine not sleeping on your belly? Consider investing in special shaped pillow that allows you to sleep on your belly while saving your face. 4. Skipping SPF \nThe sun causes your skin to age; it's as simple as that. Seeing the skin around your eyes is so thin, the aging can happen sooner than other areas of your body. Sun exposure is one of the main reasons that collagen and elastin breaks down in our skin causing wrinkles and fine lines. \nLuckily you can find many great eye creams that have sun protection in them so that not only is your eye area getting great anti-aging ingredients by SPF as well:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:33:50.253+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
