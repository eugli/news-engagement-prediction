The DRS system has already been shown to raise collection rates in Germany, Sweden and Denmark, according to environment campaigners, and is being considered by other countries including Scotland.\nThe fizzy drink manufacturer previously strongly opposed the idea, arguing that it could negatively impact its business.\nRead more Coca-Cola's multi-lingual Superbowl advert thrills social media However, in a major u-turn for the company, Coca-Cola UK announced it is now supporting the DRS scheme in Scotland.\nIn a statement sent to the Independent, Coca-Cola UK said : “We have embarked on a major review of our sustainable packaging strategy to understand what role we can play in unlocking the full potential of a circular economy in Great Britain.\n“Our sustainable packaging review is ongoing, but it’s already clear from our conversations with experts that the time is right to trial new interventions such as a well-designed deposit return scheme for drinks containers, starting in Scotland where conversations are underway,” the company added.\nCoca-Cola said it remains fully committed to finding new ways to minimise the materials it uses, reduce waste and work with other stakeholders to improve recycling rates across Britain.\nThe announcement was welcomed by environmental charity Greenpeace .\nRead more Coca-Cola's new drink could be the healthiest Coke yet Coca-Cola's Christmas truck tour should be banned, say health experts Coca-Cola is being sued for covering up soft drink health threats Louise Edge, senior oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: “Deposit schemes, which have growing support amongst the public, politicians and industry, can play a key role in reducing the amount of plastic which ends up in our oceans and in landfill.\n“Companies like Coca-Cola must have ambitious plans for 100 per cent recycled content and move away from the era of single-use, disposable, plastic. Only by these companies taking responsibility for the end life of the bottles they sell, will we close the loop on the 16 million plastic bottles which are dumped every day in the UK, and go on to pollute our beaches, land and sea.”\nUp to 12 million tonnes of plastic ends up in the sea every year, according to Greenpeace.\nThe world’s most valuable brands 10 show all The world’s most valuable brands 1/10 1st - Google Google replaced Apple as the world’s most valuable brand, with a brand value of $109.5bn, according to Brand Finance\n2/10 2nd - Apple Apple’s brand value declined from $145.9bn to $107.1bn in 2016\n3/10 3rd - Amazon Amazon's brand value rose from $69.6bn to $106.4bn in 2016\n4/10 4th - At&t Of the 40 telecoms brands in the ranking, AT&T in 2016 overtook Verizon as the most valuable brand rising to $87bn from $59.9bn the year before\n5/10 5th - Microsoft Microsoft's brand value rose marginally from $67.3bn to $76.3bn in 2016\n6/10 6th - Samsung Amazon's brand value rose from $58.6bn to $66.2bn \n7/10 7th - Verizon Verizon's brand value inched up from $63.1bn to $65.9bn \n8/10 8th - Walmart Walmart's brand value rose from $53.6bn to $62.5bn \n9/10 9th - Facebook Facebook's brand value increased sharply from $34bn to just shy of $62bn \n10/10 10th - ICBC ICBC saw its brand value rise to $47.8bn from $36.3bn.
