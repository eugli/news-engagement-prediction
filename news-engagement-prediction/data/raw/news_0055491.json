(Photo: Wells Fargo) \nStory Highlights Wells Fargo has dismissed its top executive in Arizona over a customer-account scandal Pamela Conboy had served as lead regional president in the state for the past decade Wells Fargo is the largest bank operating in Arizona, with 15,000 employees and 250 branches 575 CONNECT TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Pamela Conboy, Wells Fargo's senior executive in Arizona, was dismissed Tuesday along with three other current and former top managers in the wake of the bank's customer-account scandal.\nAs Arizona lead regional president, Conboy oversaw operations here for Wells Fargo, the largest bank in the state with 15,000 employees and 250 branches. Wells Fargo ranked fifth overall among all non-government employers in the state, according to the 2016 Republic 100 report. \nLast year, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau levied its largest fine ever, $100 million, against Wells Fargo over the illegal practice of opening unauthorized deposit and credit-card accounts for customers, then collecting fees in many cases. The actions resulted from sales targets and compensation incentives designed for certain bank employees. More than 2 million unauthorized accounts were opened.\nWells Fargo agreed to reimburse all victims and pay a $35 million penalty to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, plus $50 million to the city and county of Los Angeles. The scandal also resulted in the resignation of John Stumpf as chairman and CEO, and the dismissal of roughly 5,000 employees.\nConboy was known for getting out and talking with employees and customers around the state, spending one day each week to visit branches.\n\"I have visited every store in Arizona, sometimes two or three times,\" she once told The Arizona Republic . \"I love to hear (from employees) â€” why they came to Wells Fargo and what keeps them here.\"\nShe's a former high-school cheerleader from Southern California who made the proverbial climb up the corporate ladder in a career spanning more than 35 years with the company. She started out as a part-time worker, then moved up to teller and higher positions.\nConboy assumed her most recent post as Arizona head of banking for Wells Fargo in 2007. She chaired the Valley of the Sun United Way and served on the boards of many other charitable and civic groups in the Phoenix metro area.\nThe San Francisco-based corporation on Tuesday said its board also terminated Claudia Russ Anderson, former community-bank chief risk officer; Shelley Freeman, head of consumer credit solutions and a former Los Angeles-region president; and Matthew Raphaelson, head of community-bank strategy and initiatives.\nWells Fargo is still investigating the matter. \"None of these executives will receive a bonus for 2016, and they will forfeit all of their unvested equity awards and vested outstanding options,\" the company said in a statement.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission, federal Department of Labor and a few other federal and state regulators are still investigating the bank over this matter.\nWells Fargo apparently still needs to repair fences with some consumers.\nThe company last week reported that customer interactions at branches were down 4 percent in January from one year earlier, the number of closed consumer checking accounts rose 4 percent while the number of new checking accounts opened tumbled 31 percent.\n\"We have more work ahead as we remain focused on strengthening our relationship with existing customers and building new ones with potential customers,\" said Mary Mack, head of community banking for Wells Fargo, in a statement. The company last month rolled out a new incentive-compensation program in retail-bank centers, she said.\nReach the reporter at russ.wiles@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8616.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:11:03.771+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
