I come back along the spinal cord and I shoot into it. It's pretty instant.\" \nMr Matthews said he fires two shots. \n\"I always give it the gentleman's double to be sure.\" \nMr Matthews said his 30cm knife has saved his life more than once. \n\"I've had it 31 years and I've had some pretty wild times. \n\"It's saved me a few times from large vertebrate wildlife.\" \nHe chuckles as he responds to a question about how he used the knife in those situations. \n\"A bit like a Singer sewing machine,\" he said. \n\"I've had a pig come and have a go at me. \n\"He was trying to get me with its tusks and I was trying to get it with the knife. \n\"I won. It's very sharp,\" he grins. \n\"I love my knife.\" \nWhen catching crocodiles on Annaburroo Station, 100km from Darwin, Mr Matthews sets up camp about 30 metres from a billabong on the station, sleeping with a firearm on an elevated platform. \n\"The crew that was operating out here before us had a 4.4-metre crocodile come in the camp. \n\"I tell people not to muck around when they're waking me up.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T13:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T11:08:52.449+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
