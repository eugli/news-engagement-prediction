Their new company, Paperclip , launches next month with a pair of bags that bring a whole new level of convenience to those inevitable baby \"pit stops.\" What makes the company's bags unique is a fold-out changing station that lets parents easily change their child anywhere, anytime. In addition, the front panel opens completely to allow quick access to a \"toolbox\" that puts supplies – diapers, wipes, creams, etc. — within easy reach. Paperclip's first two models, the Willow and the Bear (named after Buckley and Baxter's children, respectively) have adjustable straps, allowing them to be worn either backpack or messenger-bag style. Both are lined with anti-microbial, liquid-resistant fabric, and the changing station can be easily removed for machine washing. There's even a laptop compartment. Paperclip Founders Actors AJ Buckley and Artie Baxter with The Willow The Bear Paperclip Diaper Bags The Willow The Bear Buckley says he conceived of the bag on his first solo outing with his daughter. \"I encountered a dilemma that parents of young kids know all too well,\" explains the actor, known for his roles on hit TV series including \"CSI:NY\" and \"Justified.\" \"She was a big mess, and most bathrooms, especially men's rooms, don't have a changing table.\" It was as he searched for a clean, private place to get his daughter tidied up that the idea for a bag with its own changing station came to him. Baxter, whose son Bear was born a few months later signed on as a partner. As the pair researched what was already available in the marketplace, they found nothing that offered the style and functionality they envisioned, says Baxter. \"Even those supposedly designed for dads are pretty awful. We didn't see any reason why a diaper bag couldn't be great looking and practical at the same time.\" The Bear and the Willow feature charcoal grey and smoke grey exteriors, respectively, with coffee-brown calf-leather flap and trim.
