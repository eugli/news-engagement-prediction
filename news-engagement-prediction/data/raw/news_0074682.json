Article continues below \nSo, while he's no longer a United player, a lot of fans are still keeping a keen eye on how he fares in Ligue 1. \nMourinho confirmed that the deal had included a buy-back clause in case Memphis finally started to live up to his potential. Article continues below Twitter is absolutely loving N'Golo Kante's message to Claudio Ranieri \nFor a young player who was once so highly-rated, there was always going to be a chance he'd excel with Lyon and potentially leave United looking rather silly. \nThe 23-year-old still has a way to go if that's going to be the case, but he has at last come up with the kind of performance Mourinho would have loved to see from him. What's happened to Memphis?! \nMemphis looks like he's recovered his confidence since his move to France, scoring twice and assisting Alexandre Lacazette's brilliance in Lyon's 5-0 win over Metz. \nThe former PSV midfielder also forced the minnows into an own goal. Maybe there is a player in there after all. \nMind you, not everyone was impressed. \nUnfortunately, Memphis is always going to have his critics after he managed just two goals in 33 league appearances during his 18 months in the Premier League. Massive improvement \nYou get the feeling that no matter what he does in Ligue 1, he won't earn the respect of some fans. Just ask Zlatan Ibrahimovic. \nLyon may be getting a little carried away with his success, putting his shirt in their club museum after he scored his first goal against Nancy earlier this month. \nYet, his latest exploits mean that he already has more league goals for Les Gones than he ever scored for United, so things are finally looking up.
