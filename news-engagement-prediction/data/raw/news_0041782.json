If you liked Ace Ventura kinda silly comedy, they nailed it. This is going to be my 2 year olds favorite movie wether he likes it or not lol I thought it was cute by deee25 My friend and I ( at that time) laughed and cried all the way through the movie. It has something about it and I love clean, innocent movies for myself and the family. It is just an adorable movie, not Oscar worthy but lovable. Cute, adorable, and funny!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T21:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T17:28:21.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
