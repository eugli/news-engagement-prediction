The process is similar to a grand jury but is public. \nWitnesses testified that the boy had been bullied for years at school and at work before he shot himself outside his family's home. \nThe jury on Tuesday concluded that negligence from a Dairy Queen in Fayette and the Glasgow School District contributed to the death and recommended a prosecutor file the charge. \nThe prosecutor, April Wilson, says she's considering the case.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:14:55.367+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
