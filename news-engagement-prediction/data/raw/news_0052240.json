Lou Williams (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 10:07 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 10:07 a.m. ET \nWhile the Pelicans made the biggest move heading into the NBA’s trade deadline by acquiring DeMarcus Cousins , the Rockets quietly addressed a need by turning Corey Brewer and a first-round pick into Lou Williams . \nIt might seem redundant for a team as good as the Rockets are offensively to acquire someone known mainly for their scoring ability — Williams is averaging a career-high 18.6 points per game this season and checks out as one of the worst defensive guards in the NBA by advanced metrics — but there are three reasons in particular why they walked away from the deal as winners. From his fit with James Harden to how Williams helps their second unit, let’s take a look at each of them in detail. \nTRADE DEADLINE: Follow along with all the NBA's deadline deals Williams gives Harden yet another great shooter \nWilliams has been a point guard for most of his NBA career, but he’s more than capable of sliding over to the two. According to Basketball Reference , he logged 80 percent of his minutes at shooting guard when he won Sixth Man of the Year with the Raptors in 2014-15, and he spent nearly half of his minutes there with the Lakers last season. \nThe reason Williams can play the two despite being a 6-1 guard is because he’s an excellent shooter across the board. In addition to knocking down close to 40 percent of his 3-point attempts this season, he ranks in the 79.3 percentile with 1.11 points per spot-up possession . His effective field goal percentage in catch-and-shoot situations is 58.0 percent , too, which is a similar rate to the likes of Eric Gordon, Kevin Love, Bradley Beal and Paul George. \nDEVENEY: Eight biggest names to watch on deadline day \nAs is the case with Russell Westbrook and LeBron James, you can never have too many shooters surrounding Harden. The more space he has to work with, the harder the Rockets will be to slow down. \nMore importantly, it will be a nice change of pace from Brewer. Brewer played 15.9 minutes per game for the Rockets this season and made 26.6 percent of his open/wide open 3-point attempts. Replacing him with Williams, who has made 42.1 percent of his open/wide open 3-point attempts this season, means teams won’t be able to send multiple defenders at Harden as easily as they have in the past. The Rockets were missing a playmaker off the bench \nAlthough Williams is a knockdown shooter, he’s actually at his best in the pick-and-roll. Almost half of his points this season have come as the ball handler in those situations, and he’s averaged 1.07 points per possession to rank in the 94.0 percentile. That means he’s scoring more points out of the pick-and-roll than Chris Paul and doing it more efficiently than Kyrie Irving, Damian Lillard and Russell Westbrook. \nJust keep in mind a lot of his minutes have come against second units, not starters. \nMORE: Magic Johnson must learn his limitations for Lakers to succeed \nThere are two ways in particular Williams like to score out of the pick-and-roll, the first being with pull-ups. Take free throws out of the equation and Williams is scoring 38.1 percent of his points this season from pull-ups, over half of which are coming from the 3-point-line. When defenders go underneath screens in an effort to keep him out of the paint, Williams won’t hesitate to light it up from deep. \nThe second way Williams likes to score out of the pick-and-roll is with floaters. According to NBA Savant , Williams is just one of three players this season to attempt at least 100 floaters, and he’s made 48.2 percent of those opportunities. So when he starts to get it rolling from the 3-point line, teams can’t simply counter him by running him off the perimeter. \nWilliams won’t likely run as many pick-and-rolls in Houston, but he will be counted on to improve their bench. With Harden on the court this season, the Rockets are averaging 113.5 points per 100 possessions . Without him, that number drops to 105.4 points per 100 possessions. Seeing as the Lakers scored 9.1 points per 100 possessions more when Williams was on the court — basically the difference between the Knicks and Warriors in offensive efficiency — they’re hoping he can have a similar impact on the Rockets. \nThere’s no reason why Williams shouldn’t have a similar impact, either. Mike D’Antoni will probably use him as the Harden of the second unit, running pick-and-rolls with Montrezl Harrell while Eric Gordon and Sam Dekker space the floor around him. The biggest difference when compared to his time with the Lakers is he’ll have to take more of a backseat role when sharing the court with Harden by functioning as a spot-up shooter and secondary playmaker. The Rockets don't need another draft pick right now \nWilliams is clearly an upgrade over Brewer, so it comes as no surprise the Rockets needed to include a first-round pick to make the trade happen. It’s not a huge loss for the Rockets, though, because they’re better off having Williams down the stretch the stretch of this season and all of next season than another draft pick. D’Antoni has been dealing with a 10-man rotation anyway — one which includes three players they’ve drafted since 2014 — and Williams will take over all of Brewer’s minutes moving forward. \nPlus, there’s only one player from that rotation who isn’t under contract next season: Nene Hilario. Everyone else will be back unless the Rockets decide to move on from them in the offseason. \nNBA DRAFT: Who goes No. 1 in SN's latest prospect rankings? \nThe one question about Williams’ fit in Houston revolves around his defense. Williams has never been known as a good defender, and the Rockets are in the middle of the pack this season in defensive efficiency. They’d benefit from having another wing defender going into the playoffs, but it’s just as important they acquired someone who can take some of the load off Harden’s shoulders. It’s not like the Rockets were relying as much on Brewer’s defense at this stage of his career, either. \nIf they were, Williams’ shortcomings would be a far bigger deal.
