According to a story shared on Facebook by one Morris, a car dealer was brutalised by some soldiers who was sent to him by a man who had given him a car to sell. The man was beaten almost to an inch of his life, and left lying in the streets of Umuahia, Abia state. Read what happened below: \"See what Nigerian soldiers did to one of my friends in Umuahia, Abia state. This guy is a car dealer. A man brought him a car to sell, this guy repaired the car with his money, sampled the car for buyers to come but could not sell it. After weeks, he kindly returned the car to the owner, the owner accused him of messing up the car when there is nothing like that. This man brought 4 Nigerian soldiers to turn this guy to a half dead man. Are Nigerian soldiers made to protect or kill? What a shame! Share this let the whole World see it. Federal Government should call military to order. \" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:04:24.853+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
