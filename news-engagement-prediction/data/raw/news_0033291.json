Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 7:27 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 7:27 p.m. ET \nMahogany Steakhouse is a Kevin Durant-free zone, apparently. \nThe Oklahoma City restaurant, according to USA TODAY , has turned down a request from Durant to rent out the establishment for a postgame shindig following the star's much anticipated return to play the Thunder. \nMORE: Looking ahead to Durant's homecoming \nThe restaurant's owner, Dave Osborn, said he turned down an initial request for a private gathering, saying the location is a popular one for Thunder fans and players to attend after games; he didn't want to upset his hometown customers. \nDurant reached out to Osborn again and said Thunder players could still come in if he was allowed to rent out the restaurant, but Osborn sill refused. \n\"And we just said no again, because once again all the Thunder players come in and we don’t really want them to be upset,\" Osborn told USA TODAY. \"And in the long run, I think we lose business. We just wanted to stay true to our fans and our players and not book out the restaurant for one night.” \nKevin Durant's agent, Rich Kleiman, denies that Durant attempted to rent out the restaurant for $40,000.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T07:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T03:16:03.906+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
