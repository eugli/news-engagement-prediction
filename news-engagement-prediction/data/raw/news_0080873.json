The vehicles boxed him in, with one stopping in front, another by the side and a third right behind him. \nThe men from the three vehicles dashed out and a split second later a sedan pulled up just behind the last car blocking Koh’s Honda. \nEven before the sedan came to a complete halt, the front passenger door opened and a man dashed out and joined the melee.\nThe footage showed a commotion around Koh’s Honda Accord before a fifth car stopped further behind and a man jumped out from the front passenger seat. \nHe immediately gestured for a Myvi, driven by a member of the public, to back off from the scene.\nThe Myvi was seen reversing some 50 feet or more and a motorcyclist stopped in front of it. \nThe other motorcyclist was seen riding around as if to maintain perimeter around the scene of the abduction.\nThen, all the cars, including Koh’s Honda were seen speeding away.\nThe whole episode took less than a minute.\nKoh, 62, was abducted while on his way to a friend’s house in Kelana Jaya. Police found the Honda car’s number plate on the road at the scene. \nAccording to a resident in the area, his wife was washing clothes in the porch when she heard a loud bang. \n“She thought it was an accident and saw a commotion before the cars drove off,” he said.\nThe family is offering a reward of up to RM100,000 for the safe return of Koh.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T03:30:37.210+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
