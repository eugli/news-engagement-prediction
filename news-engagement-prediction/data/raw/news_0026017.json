Thirunavukkarasar told TOI, \"The governor should fulfil his constitutional duty, which means inviting the person whom the legislature party has elected as its leader. Congress is not bothered about individuals.\"However, P Chidambaram, EVKS Elangovan and others are against showing any softness for Sasikala. Chidambaram has even gone to the extent of saying that the governor is within his rights to delay the swearing-in.A view in Congress is that Sasikala may have the backing of a majority of MLAs but the AIADMK rank and file favours Panneerselvam. Given the uncertainty, Congress is likely to stay aloof and watch the situation unfold.A Congress office-bearer said Rahul told party leaders to wait for the governor's decision before taking a stand.According to party leaders, the eight MLAs of Congress in TN have little role in government formation but landing on the right side of the AIADMK feud could be key to the coming presidential elections. AIADMK's solid strength in the assembly and Parliament gives it a disproportionate voice in the presidential electoral college.According to the political buzz, if BJP has a bad result in the five states going to polls, realignment by a couple of regional parties can open up the top election.Given the prospect, Congress members argue that the party gains little by antagonising AIADMK if Sasikala is going to emerge victorious.But siding with her in the uncertain scenario, with a looming court verdict in a corruption case, can also prove a costly mistake.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T04:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:09:42.603+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
