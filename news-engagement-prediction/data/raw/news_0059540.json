The House passed it last week. \nSupporters argue that the stricter charges — a priority for Gov. Eric Greitens, a Republican in his first year as the state’s chief executive — send a message of support to law enforcement who feel they can’t proactively police. \nConversation on the House floor last week also included the shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager killed by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in 2014. Wilson was not charged, but the shooting triggered months of protests and a national debate over racially biased policing. \nIt also triggered a “Ferguson effect,” Greitens has argued, that makes it difficult to recruit police officers to work in Missouri. \nSponsoring Rep. Marsha Haefner, R-Oakville, said she was motivated to take action when she heard St. Louis County police officers say their families had being threatened or their homes vandalized because of their profession. \nHer bill initially would have made targeting police officers a hate crime. Similar legislation has been passed in other states and is sometimes known as a “Blue Lives Matter” bill. \nAfter fielding concerns, Haefner amended her proposal to instead extend the list of crimes that bring tougher charges if committed against law enforcement instead of a civilian. Police officers already are a protected class under the state’s special victims’ statute. \nDemocrats wondered if taking intent out of the legislation could make for lengthy sentences for someone found guilty of crimes rooted in reckless indifference, committed by someone with no intent of targeting an officer. \nCrimes such as involuntary manslaughter, argued Rep. Peter Merideth D-St. Louis, can’t be intentionally directed at a police officer. \n“This isn’t because of what they do for a living … this is, it just so happens that it is a police officer who is the victim,” he said. \nFor example, Merideth said, a teenage girl driving recklessly could unfairly face significantly more jail time for accidentally hitting a police officer instead of hitting a civilian. \n“That is exactly why we didn’t do mandatory sentences, so prosecutors would have discretion in what charges to make and what possibly motivated or did not motivate the crime,” Haefner responded. \nBlack Democrats raised concerns that leaving situational charges up to police and prosecutors’ discretion could lead to racial injustice, particularly for protesters. \n“We’d have to build another prison if this was law when Ferguson happened,” said Rep. Clem Smith, D-Velda Village Hills. Addressing concerns \nHouse Speaker Todd Richardson, R-Poplar Bluff, said there was no merit to the argument that the bill could be used to unfairly punish protesters. \nOther Republicans contended that if protests are peaceful, it wouldn’t be an issue. \nRep. Bruce Franks, D-St. Louis, a Ferguson activist, said that isn’t necessarily true for people of color. \n“You obeying the law and me obeying the law can turn out very differently,” Franks said. \nSome GOP lawmakers urged their colleagues not to dismiss protections for the vast majority of police officers who are ethical and risk their lives to keep people safe. \n“They want to serve their community. They want to help people,” said Rep. Shawn Rhoads, R-West Plains, a former police officer. \nOpponents to the proposal questioned what they argue is an urgency to protect police but an unwillingness to seriously consider criminal justice reform. \n“The only thing we want to do is give increased protections to those who aren’t in jeopardy,” said Rep. Brandon Ellington, D-Kansas City. \nHaefner acknowledged a need to address police accountability — but at another time. \n“Those are two entirely different subjects,” Haefner said. “And we do need to have more discussions on resolving the events that happened in Ferguson, but that had nothing to do with this bill.” \nThe House also voted to approve a statewide emergency alert system that would help law enforcement more quickly apprehend anyone who harms a police officer. Ferguson response bills \nTwo Ferguson-related reform bills have been given hearings in House committees. One, backed by Ellington, would assign numbers to law enforcement personnel to track written complaints against officers as they move from agency to agency. \nAnother, from House Minority Leader Gail McCann Beatty, D-Kansas City, would require the appointment of a special prosecutor when charges are filed in officer-involved shootings. \nSimilar legislation has been filed in the past, but each bill has stalled, along with dozens of other criminal justice reform proposals inspired by Ferguson, such as citizen review boards, body cameras for police officers and new training protocols. \nMcCann Beatty’s bill was met with resistance from Missouri prosecutors, who said it undermined local prosecutors who people within a jurisdiction have voted into office. \nShe said she would work with prosecutors to tweak the bill, but maintained it was a reasonable response to the events in Ferguson. \n“It addresses the fact that the general public no longer has faith in our legal system,” McCann Beatty said.
