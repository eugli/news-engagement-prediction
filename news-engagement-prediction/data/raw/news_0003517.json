Inside the safe house and escape tunnel used by Mexican drug lord 'El Chapo' \nGuzman’s absence also would give the public the impression he was too dangerous for a courtroom and make for prejudicial pretrial publicity, they added. He is locked up for 23 hours a day at Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown Manhattan, according to the defense. \nBrooklyn prosecutors said if the judge was going to look into Guzman's financial eligibility for appointed counsel, they had no problem with his presence. \nThe government calls Guzman, 62, the billionaire leader of the Sinaloa Cartel and said a \"strenuous\" inquiry by the court was needed to be sure taxpayers aren't needlessly footing Guzman's legal bills. \nBut if Cogan was not going to get into Guzman's financials in court, they advised video conferencing. \nProsecutors pointed to his past prison escapes, as well as the burden on the U.S. Marshals, the costs and traffic problems connected with bringing Guzman to court.
