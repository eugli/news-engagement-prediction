Iodine-131 (value +/- uncertainty) in the atmosphere (Photo: IRSN) \nHowever, the Finish authority STUK said that, although the levels of radiation were higher than normal, they were not high enough to pose a health risk to humans. \n\"The highest concentrations were measured in Poland, but even there they were very far away from the concentrations, which could have any effect on human health,\" it said.

The radiation spike was detected in January (Photo: Getty Images) \nSome conspiracy theorists claim the radiation spike is evidence that Russia is performing nuclear tests in the Arctic. \nHowever, a more plausible explanation is that it is the result of a pharmaceutical factory leak, as Iodine-131 is widely used in the treatment of hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancer. \n\"Since only Iodine-131 was measured, and no other radioactive substances, we think it originates from a pharmaceutical company producing radioactive drugs,\" Astrid Liland from the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority told Motherboard . Iodine-131 was a significant contributor to the health hazards from the Chernobyl disaster (Photo: bionerd23) \nThe US Air Force deployed its WC-135 nuclear explosion \"sniffer\" aircraft to the UK last week, to help narrow down the source. \nThe news echoes an event in 2011, when low levels of radioactive Iodine-131 were detected in several European countries for a few weeks. \nThe source of the leak was found to be a faulty filter system at the Institute of Isotopes in Budapest, Hungary, which produces a wide variety of radioactive isotopes for medical treatment and research.
