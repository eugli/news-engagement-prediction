You’re actually like your dad!” \nOn what would have been his 55th birthday, we take a look back at his five best moments. GETTY The Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin would have been 55 today \n1. The time he got bitten on the nose by a bearded dragon \nIn the hilarious 30-second clip, Steve was heard calling the small lizard “cantankerous” and “cranky” and it appeared that the small reptile took issue with his words and gave him a little nip. \nSteve was heard exclaiming: “You little brat!” \n2. The time he got chased by a giant bird \nHe handled some of the most deadly animals on the planet but there were times when he found himself up against some less dangerous ones. \nHalf-way through this video montage, Steve is seen trying to run away from a giant bird chasing him through the bush. \n3. Dealing with the world’s deadliest snake \nIn one of the most famous clips of Steve, the naturalist was seen taking on one of the most dangerous snakes in the world. \nHe was seen grabbing the Inland Taipan by the tail and explaining to viewers how venomous it was. \n4. When he was got getting preened by a stork \nIn a rather exasperating filming session, Steve had to do numerous takes as he kept getting pecked by a stork. \nIt turned out that the bird mistook him for a fellow feathered friend and was trying to preen him.
