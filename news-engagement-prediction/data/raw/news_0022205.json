Assad, whose country has been racked by a civil war that has created nearly 5 million refugees, was elected in 2014 to a seven-year term (his third) with nearly 90 percent of the vote. The election, which was held only in government-controlled areas, was widely denounced as a farce.\nAssad’s willingness to step down was contingent on first “defeating the terrorists” and establishing a “national unity government” after “dialogue between the Syrians about the future of Syria.” He added that there would need to be a “public consensus” on his leaving.\nAsked how he would know if there was such a consensus, he said it was something “you can sense, you can feel … and then if you want to do something documented, you can have [a] referendum.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T02:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T14:58:41.493+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
