Before you start to worry, this isn't a sign of an impending apocalypse. Working in conjunction with NASA, lead researcher Dr. Anita Goel hopes that by sending MRSA bacteria to a zero-gravity environment, we can better understand how superbugs mutate to become resistant to available antibiotics. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA, sometimes called a staph, is resistant to the antibiotic methicillin and many others. It can cause a variety of health problems including sepsis, pneumonia and skin and bloodstream infections. Goel is a medical doctor and a physicist. She's also chairwoman and CEO of her lab and company, Nanobiosym which seeks out breakthroughs and technologies that span and combine physics, biomedicine and nanotechnology. First results from NASA's twins study after Scott Kelly's mission \"We are excited to put MRSA on the International Space Station and investigate the effects of microgravity on the growth and mutation patterns of these bugs,\" Goel said at a NASA news conference last week. \"I have this hypothesis that microgravity will accelerate the mutation patterns. If we can use microgravity as an accelerator to fast-forward and get a sneak preview of what these mutations will look like, then we can essentially build smarter drugs on Earth.\" Read More Drug-resistant superbug may be craftier, more widespread The space station is essentially an orbiting lab where hundreds of experiments are carried out every day. The zero-gravity, or microgravity, environment has already been host to research on bacteria. The ISS itself has a \"microbiome\" of bacteria based on the comings and goings of astronauts. In 2016, DNA was sequenced for the first time aboard the station. This all connects back to Goel's initial interest in the effect of an environment on DNA and what can be retrieved from it. \"The DNA is like a piano. The info in the DNA sequence is only part of what makes the music of an organism,\" she said. \"The info embedded in the environment interplays with what is embedded in the DNA sequence, and together, they determine the music that the organism plays.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T06:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:42:48.857+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
