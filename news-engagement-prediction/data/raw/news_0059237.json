(photo credit:Courtesy) \nToday it is taken for granted that anyone interested in Holocaust research will be able to easily access such information, because it is no farther than a computer keyboard and an Internet connection.Not long ago, it was not so simple to find: confirmation of having been a concentration camp inmate or having worked in a forced labor unit; information on relatives and friends who did not survive; names of death camps; Nazis policies and deportations; in fact, anything and everything related to the Holocaust. Hitler lookalike wanted by Austrian police The world-wide web became operable and accessible on August 6, 1991, and a little longer to become a regular means of communication and data searching. It took longer still to make the Holocaust Archives at the International Tracing Service at Bad Arolsen in Germany accessible. Common sense would dictate that material collected by allied forces as they liberated the camps would be made available as soon as it was put into any kind of order. But it remained inaccessible until December 2006, when the 11-country International Commission that formulates policy for the ITS, finally voted to unseal what CBS’s 60 Minutes called “Hitler’s Secret Archive.”In June, 2007, Scott Pelley, one of the program’s anchors, brought three Holocaust survivors to Bad Arolsen to examine records relating to them and their relatives. They were shocked. One of the survivors, Mickey Swartz, who was sent to Buchenwald from Hungary as a 14-year-old, discovered that he was to be transferred to Dora, where the V-1 and V-2 rockets fired at Britain were made. His name was on the list, but someone had put a line through it and through the name of another prisoner. Very few people emerged alive from Dora.The person who for years lobbied every possible source, wrote and lectured about the need to make the archives accessible, was Paul A. Shapiro, director of International Affairs and director emeritus of the Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Shapiro was in Israel this week and shared his harrowing story at the Van Leer Institute in Jerusalem. For years he kept striking a stone wall in his bid to have the archives opened. It pained him that survivors looking for relatives, who might also have survived, waited years without any reply to their requests. The archives contained thousands of testimonies taken by liberation forces, many of which identified perpetrators of atrocities who had hidden among the prisoners. Photographs, post cards and ID cards were among the more than hundred million records kept from survivors and scholars by the commission. “They were ready to deny the last remnant of the Holocaust generation access,” said Shapiro, whose own request for data in the mammoth archives was denied. Shapiro was convinced that the commission’s attitude was meant to minimize post-war interest in the Holocaust.“Keeping the documents secret could be considered a form of Holocaust denial,” he said. “So many survivors passed away without knowing what ITS held for them.”Shapiro believes more perpetrators would have been brought to justice had there been earlier access to the archives, which he feels warn that any resurgence of antisemitism will spread to include non-Jews. Now, more than 70 years after the Holocaust, “we’re still dealing with genocide,” he said. “Antisemitism is bad for the Jews but also extremely dangerous for everyone else.” Former maid to Adolf Hitler interview with Israeli media on life at private estate‏ Shapiro was in Israel under the auspices of Phyllis Greenberg Heideman, Richard D.
