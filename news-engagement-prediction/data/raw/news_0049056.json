As reported by Sport 's Ivan San Antonio , the Spain international made the comments while he attended the opening of a new Padel court ( warning: strong language ): \"With Luis Enrique we came from the s----est place and we won the treble. I know football has no memory but I'd like us to look back and see all the work he has done with us. I don't understand how people have such short memories. Beyond that, everything he achieved as a player too. \"I don't understand the whistles for the team. We are with the coach to the death. Together we will all try to move forward.\" Jean Catuffe/Getty Images The Catalans have lost just two matches since the turn of the year but find themselves behind rivals Real Madrid in the Spanish title race, with Los Blancos having two matches in hand. In Europe, the Blaugrana are on the verge of an early exit, as Paris Saint-Germain took a huge 4-0 lead in the first leg of their tie. Barcelona's play has been uninspired, and star forward Lionel Messi has had to save the team from embarrassment on multiple occasions. He was at it again on Sunday, scoring a last-minute penalty to guide his team past Leganes. A large portion of the fans whistled the manager during the match, and his future seems unclear at this point. Sports writer Dermot Corrigan is sure he won't last: Dermot Corrigan @dermotmcorrigan Pretty clear that Luis Enrique's time about to end at Barca, but what happens next very much up in air: https://t.co/N8MpD8LcBY 2/20/2017, 1:33:51 PM The 46-year-old returned to Barcelona in 2014 as a coach, having spent a large part of his playing career at the Camp Nou. He guided the club to back-to-back La Liga titles and the treble in the 2014-15 campaign. His managerial career has been filled with ups and downs, however. He flopped at AS Roma , and he had a highly publicised clash with Messi during a training session in 2015, as Benjamin Mathieu told RMC (h/t ESPN FC's Ian Holyman ). At the time, there were plenty of rumours Enrique could leave the club, per Goal's Ben Hayward . Those rumours have now returned, and while the coach still seems to have the support of the players, he'll likely be dismissed if the Catalans fail to win La Liga or the Champions League this season.
