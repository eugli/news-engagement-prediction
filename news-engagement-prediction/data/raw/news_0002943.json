A ringing endorsement from a horrible AG. \nâ€” Felicia Gomez ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ (@FeliciaBGomez) January 31, 2017 @politico AGAIN we see what's been so wrong in the AG's office. Did @AGLynch get her partisan talking points from @BillClinton on a plane? \nâ€” Wayne Powers (@waynepowers) January 31, 2017 @politico Rule of law? Like when you met secretly with the husband of the woman you were investigating for high crimes? \nâ€” Stef Newman (@StefNewman53) January 31, 2017 @politico almost as much integrity as secret meetings on the tarmac with family of someone she should be prosecuting. \nâ€” Loren C (@LorenSethC) January 31, 2017 @politico Not unlike your meeting w Bill Clinton.
