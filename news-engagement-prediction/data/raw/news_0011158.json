Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Scottish government and local councils want to increase immigration to offset the country's aging population \nThe report reads: \"The evidence that we have collected shows that the demographic risks for Scotland of a reduction in the number of EU migrants are more acute than for the UK as a whole. \n\"This leads us to conclude that there has to be a bespoke - or differentiated - solution for immigration policy in Scotland in the future. The committee also recognises that there may need to be a bespoke solution that can respond to skills or demographic needs in other parts of the UK.\" \nCommittee convener and SNP MSP Joan McAlpine said EU migrants had been left \"effectively living in a state of limbo while they wait to hear what will happen to them after Brexit\". 'Devastating effect' \nShe said: \"EU migration has helped reverse a decline in the Scottish population, particularly amongst people of working age. A 'hard Brexit' runs the risk of driving this valuable group of European citizens out of Scotland. \n\"That will have a devastating effect on the communities where EU citizens have made their home, businesses and key sectors of our economy. We're therefore calling on the UK and Scottish governments to identify a differentiated solution for immigration policy in Scotland after Brexit as soon as possible.\" \nThe committee's deputy convener, Labour's Lewis Macdonald, added that the report \"presents strong evidence of the risks facing key sectors of our economy without the continued access to the vital source of labour that EU citizens currently provide\". \nTwo Scottish Conservative members of the committee, Jackson Carlaw and Rachael Hamilton, said the report did not reflect their view on immigration policy in Scotland. \nThey said the Tories preferred a \"sectoral approach to immigration - not a geographic one\". Image copyright PA Image caption The UK government has pledged to examine fresh devolution in light of Brexit \nFigures from the Leave side suggested during the EU referendum that Scotland could be given greater control over immigration . \nThe UK government's white paper on Brexit notes that there could be fresh devolution in light of powers being \"repatriated\" from Brussels. \nHighlighting agriculture, environment and transport as potential examples, the white paper says: \"As the power to make these rules are repatriated to the UK from the EU, we have an opportunity to determine the level best placed to make new laws and policies on these issues, ensuring power sits closer to the people of the UK than ever before. \n\"We have already committed that no decisions currently taken by the devolved administrations will be removed from them, and we will use the opportunity of bringing decision making back to the UK to ensure that more decisions are devolved.\" \nThe paper says the UK government will \"continue to champion devolution\", but underlined that the final settlement will be one which \"works for the whole of the UK\". \nIn response to the Westminster group's call for devolved immigration powers, a UK government spokesman said: \"As we leave the EU, we must face the future together as one United Kingdom. \n\"We're clear that we want protect the status of EU nationals already living here, and the only circumstances in which that wouldn't be possible is if UK citizens' rights in European member states were not protected in return.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T07:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T02:35:08.823+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
