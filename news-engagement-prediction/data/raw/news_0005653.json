Palladian bridge \nThe RHS Chatsworth Show will run from 7-11 June and up to 80,000 visitors are expected. \nThree new temporary pontoon bridges will be built across the River Derwent as part of the show to allow visitors to access displays on both sides.

Image copyright RHS Image caption The Moveable Feast by Worcestershire-based Tanya Batkin is a pack-up-and-go garden aimed at the Rent Generation who want portability \n\"The sheer scale of the location, with the River Derwent running through it, allows designers to \"break the mould and do something slightly different\" Ms Patterson said. \n\"Our aim is to create a new show that champions the horticultural innovation of today and the future, and encourages exhibitors to be progressive and think outside the box,\" RHS director of shows Nick Mattingley added.
