Women are still paid less than men, they still take up part time jobs and they take up caring roles than the state as taken over. \n“The state essentially pays people to care for them. That is a big state and that is what you want Owen. \n“You want a big state, you want the state meddling in everybody’s decisions, meddling in the family, supplementing everybody’s income.

You are arguing for state meddling, for bullying of families, bullying mothers in particular.” \nIn 2016, the women and equalities committee made 17 recommendations to the Government on how to reduce the gender pay gap. \nIt has now emerged the majority of them were rejected and MPs claimed evidence showing women are still paid less than men has been ignored. \nMs Miller said it was “deeply disappointing” the government was failing to take aboard the recommendations it made in a report last March. \n“We made practical, evidence-based recommendations to address these issues,” she said. \n“They were widely supported by a range of stakeholders including businesses, academics, and unions.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:31:32.686+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
