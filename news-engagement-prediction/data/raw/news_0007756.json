According to the filing, Spiegel and Murphy have both signed employment agreements, meaning they can theoretically quit or be fired by the board of directors at any time. Given their control of the company, it seems that the only way for one of them to be fired would be in the unlikely event of one turning on the other. Even if one or both of them is fired, \"they will continue to have the ability to exercise the same significant voting power and potentially control the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval.\" If either Spiegel or Murphy passes away, their Class C stock will convert into Class B stock nine months later, and \"the remaining co-founder will be able to exercise voting control over our outstanding capital stock.\" \nOn a weird, morbid note, the filing also notes that \"Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy are high profile individuals who have received threats in the past and are likely to continue to receive threats in the future.\" In other words, Snap is warning that the two men may be facing danger from crazed fans.
