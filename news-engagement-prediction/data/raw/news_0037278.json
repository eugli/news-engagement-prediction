DCFS told Us Weekly that it can't comment on this ongoing investigation. \nThe singer, who was previously married to Michael Jackson and Nicolas Cage , also claimed that nearly all of her $300 million fortune is gone and claimed that Lockwood spent more than a million dollars on her credit cards. \nShe added that she has been forced to move in with her daughter Riley Keough , whose father was Presley's first husband, Danny Keough, but also revealed that she receives a monthly income of approximately $100,000 a month from her inheritance, and receives a salary of approximately $4300 a month as an employee of Graceland, which allows her to obtain health insurance for herself, Lockwood and their daughters. \nLockwood's lawyer, Jeff Sturman, denied Presley's claims in a statement to Us Weekly . Famous Star Families \n\"Mr. Lockwood and his lawyers believe that it is very unfortunate and inappropriate that Ms. Presley chose to file a one-sided, inaccurate version of the facts in the Family Law Court’s publicly accessible files,\" Sturman said in a statement. \"Ms. Presley and her lawyers undoubtedly knew that their highly sensational, inaccurate and unproven claims would be of great interest to the media, which would disseminate Ms. Presley’s inaccurate story as a result. To make matters worse, Ms. Presley failed to disclose very important information in the papers she filed in the Family Law Court and the things she failed to disclose are directly related to her inflammatory claims against Mr. Lockwood.\" \n\"Mr. Lockwood is not going to publicly disclose very negative information about Ms. Presley to retaliate,\" he continued. \"Mr. Lockwood and his lawyers did not choose to litigate these personal matters in the press. Therefore, while Mr. Lockwood denies the truth of what Ms. Presley chose to put in the press, he has no further statement at this time.\" \nWant stories like these delivered straight to your inbox?
