Mohammed Ndume \nHe was, among other things, alleged to have furnished them with the telephone numbers of top government officials and judges, among which was the phone number of the then Attorney General of the Federation. \nThe sect was said to have called some of those whose numbers were given to them and threatened to visit them with ‘fire and brimstone.’ \nMeanwhile, trial judge, Justice Gabriel Kolawale, adjourned the case to hear a no-case submission by the defendant. \nNdume had, through his lawyer, Mr. Ricky Tarfa (SAN), contended that government failed to establish a prima facie terrorism case against him. \nHe maintained that the proof of evidence adduced before the court did not nail him to any act of terrorism. \nConsequently, he prayed the court to discharge and acquit him for want of nexus between him and the allegations. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T12:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T09:11:10.880+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
