BENDER, Associated Press Replay Video SETTINGS OFF HD HQ SD LO SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) â€” Rescuers chest-deep in water steered boats full of people, some with babies and pets, on Tuesday from a San Jose neighborhood inundated by water from an overflowing creek.\nAt least 225 residents were taken to dry land and rinsed with soap and water to prevent them from being sickened by floodwaters that had traveled through engine fuel, garbage, debris and over sewer lines, San Jose Fire Capt. Mitch Matlow said.\nResidents went door-to-door searching for people who needed to leave the neighborhood and only residents who could prove they had been cleaned of the floodwaters were allowed to board buses to shelters.\n\"This is like once-in-a-lifetime,\" said Bobby Lee, 15, of the water around him.\nHe was rescued with his brother and parents, who took clothes, electronics and some photos from their home in a neighborhood that ended up littered with submerged cars.\nEarlier Tuesday, firefighters rescued five people stranded by flooding at a homeless camp along the same creek in San Jose.\nFirefighters went door-to-door to tell residents to get out of their homes because the city does not have sirens or another emergency warning system, San Jose spokesman David Vossbrink said.\nThe rains were the latest produced by a series of storms generated by so-called atmospheric rivers that dump massive quantities of Pacific Ocean water on California after carrying it aloft from as far away as Hawaii.\nThe latest downpours swelled waterways to flood levels and left about half the state under flood, wind and snow advisories.\nIn another area of San Jose, the fire department was called to Coyote Creek amid reports of as many as 40 people being stranded at a homeless encampment.\nThat number turned out to be inaccurate and five people were located and rescued, fire Capt. Mitch Matlow said.\nTheir condition was not immediately available.\nCalifornia storms In the Sierra Nevada mountain range, part of Highway 50, one of the main routes to Lake Tahoe, was in danger of collapsing after a roadway shoulder gave way following heavy storms, leaving a gaping hole about 40 feet long and 17 feet wide, Caltrans engineer Jarrett Woodruff said.\nCrews opened one lane open Tuesday as Caltrans workers tried to fix the road failure after numerous mudslides blocked it for days at a time in recent weeks.\nHeavy storms over the last two weeks caused parts of the shoulder and part of one lane on the four-lane highway give way.\nIn the San Joaquin Valley in California's agricultural heartland, farmers used their tractors and other heavy equipment to help shore up an endangered levee along the San Joaquin River.\nSome farmers took their tractors and other equipment to the levee to help shore it up, arriving to fill a big breach within half an hour of noticing the break, said alfalfa farmer Tony Coit.\n\"The farmers ran it like a boss,\" he said, using soil from the levee itself to fill in the 30-foot-wide break until they could truck in large rocks for more substantial repairs.\nThe water level rose at Lake Oroville for the first time since authorities ordered an emergency evacuation of 188,000 people more than a week ago after a damaged spillway caused major flooding concerns.\nThe rains have saturated the once-drought stricken region and wreaked havoc for residents hit hard by the storms. At least four people have died in the storms throughout the state in the last week.\nA motorist in Northern California was swept into a creek Saturday during another in the series of storms and drowned inside her car, the Los Angeles Times reported Tuesday.\nWitnesses had seen the woman driving around signs blocking the road near Orland, Undersheriff Todd James of the Glenn County Sheriff's Office told the newspaper.\nThe current storm system began to weaken Tuesday after dumping more than a half-inch of rain in the San Joaquin Valley, over an inch in San Francisco, and more than 5 inches in the mountains above Big Sur over the previous 24 hours, the National Weather Service reported.\nDry weather was expected to return to the region on Wednesday.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Scott Smith in Fresno also contributed to this report.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;DomainId&quot;:", "http://api.5min.com/studio/518298198/videos.xml?num_of_videos=50&page=1&SID=1863&sort=most_recent&return_num_items=true&include_children=true&country=US&return_category_id=true&show_original_url=true&show_renditions=true&show_renditions_status=true&thumbnail_sizes=true&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;externalPlayerName&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;AOL&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;externalPlayerUri&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://pshared.5min.com/scripts/playerseed.js?s", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA8BNnP.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Whirlpool", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAnbj4i.img&quot;}}", "http://pshared.5min.com/scripts/playerseed.js?sid=1863&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:", "http://www.ap.org/"], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T08:18:48.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
