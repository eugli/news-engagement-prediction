The UK is also criticized for “shirking” its responsibility to help tackle the global refugee crisis, especially for its recent decision to scrap the Dubs Amendment, scaling down its intake of child refugees from 3,000 to 350. \n“We are witnessing the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War and wealthy nations like the UK and the US have shown an appalling lack of leadership and responsibility,” said Allen. \n“History will judge us for this.” The report goes on to criticize the UK for implementing one of the “broadest regimes of mass surveillance” through the Investigatory Powers Act 2016 , dubbed the ‘snooper’s charter’. The new law extends the reach of state surveillance in Britain, allowing authorities to hack, intercept and retain people’s personal data. \nThe charity said the powers undermine people’s rights to privacy. \n“By introducing one of the broadest regimes for mass surveillance of any country in the world, the UK took a significant step towards a reality where the right to privacy is simply not recognized,” Amnesty said. \nAllen also hit out at the British government for failing to intervene in global calamities like the conflict in Syria.
