(Win McNamee/Getty Images) \nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer indicated Thursday that state-legal medical marijuana programs are safe, but said he expects \"greater enforcement\" of federal law against state-legal recreational marijuana. \nThe remarks at a press briefing come amid continued uncertainty about whether Attorney General Jeff Sessions will seek to use his office to crush state-regulated cannabis markets. \nMarijuana possession for any reason outside limited research remains a federal crime, but the Obama administration chose to allow broad state autonomy, permitting the emergence of a multibillion-dollar industry. \nMore than half of states now allow medical marijuana, and eight states have laws authorizing recreational sales, though only four currently have operating markets. \nThe Trump administration has provided little clarity on how its approach may differ from the Obama years, and some activists have taken to checking whether the Justice Department's 2013 Cole Memo allowing for recreational stores remains online. \nBullish recreational shop owners and investors have said they believe the industry's size and popular support would protect them from Sessions, despite the former Republican senator's avowed opposition to legalization. \nBut Spicer's Thursday comments may send a shiver down their spines.
