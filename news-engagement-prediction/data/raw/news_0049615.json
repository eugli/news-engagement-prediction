The crime in question need not be serious- even those suspected of traffic violations could be targeted for deportation. \nWhile the administration says those accused of crimes will be \"the first to go\", nearly all of the 11 million illegal immigrants residing in the US are now at risk of immediate deportation.

That’s entirely a figment of folks’ imagination. This is not intended to produce mass roundups, mass deportations.” \nThe only group shielded from deportation will be so-called \"dreamers\", those who were brought to the US as children but do not have citizenship. \n\"We're going to try and take care of the Dreamers very, very much,\" Mr Trump told MSNBC on Tuesday. \nThe plan will also allow for expedited deportations for people who have been in the country for less than two years, regardless of where they live. Under Mr Obama, only those in the country for two weeks or less and living within 100 miles of the border were subject to expedited deportation.

He had previously deflected questions about a rise in antisemitism, telling one reporter he found it “insulting” to be asked about the issue. \n“The anti-Semitic threats targeting our Jewish community and community centres are horrible and are painful and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil,” he said on Tuesday. \nIvanka Trump, the president’s daughter and a convert to Judaism, spoke out against antisemitism on Monday night. \n“America is a nation built on the principle of religious tolerance. We must protect our houses of worship & religious centres,” she wrote on Twitter. \nMr Spicer was asked if Mr Trump would extend the same sentiments to Muslims who had experienced prejudice, but he spoke instead about the dangers posed by \"radical Islamic terrorism.\" Follow Telegraph News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:45:21.439+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
