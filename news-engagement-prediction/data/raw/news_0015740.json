Today, the company announced that the ZeroTouch app will be getting a whole new suite of functionality through a partnership to integrate Amazon’s Alexa assistant into the app. \nNow, in addition to sending texts or starting GPS directions, you’ll be able to use Alexa to answer questions, control smart home devices, or even order things straight from your car. In a year where Alexa integration is bigger than ever and car manufacturers are already touting vehicles with Amazon’s assistant built in , the ZeroTouch update marks perhaps the easiest way to add Alexa to almost any car. Also included in the update is the ability to send and read emails and accept calendar invitations through the ZeroTouch app. \nThe Alexa update is free for all current ZeroTouch users and is available in the United States and United Kingdom starting today. The Logi ZeroTouch is still only compatible with Android devices (due to iOS restrictions), and is available from Logitech for $59.99 for an air vent-mounted version, while a dashboard model costs $79.99.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T10:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T10:30:34.170+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
