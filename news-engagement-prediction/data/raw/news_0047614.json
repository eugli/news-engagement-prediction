Article continues below \nHarry Kane and Dele Alli both started in a strong(ish) line-up at the Ghelamco Arena yet it was Jeremy Perbet's 59th-minute strike that secured a shock 1-0 win for the hosts. \nSpeaking after the game, Pochettino admitted Tottenham are going through a \"bad period\". Article continues below There was something very bizarre about Gent's starting XI vs Tottenham [Tweet] \n\"That is the reality. It sometimes happens,\" he said . \"Good and bad things happen. We've started now a bad period. I hope, on Sunday, we break that negative run. \n\"It's not about confidence. Not about confidence. We were wrong with our judgement if we think, because of Liverpool, it's only about confidence.\" \nPochettino made some bold changes for the Gent game by dropping Christian Eriksen and Son Heung-min, with Moussa Sissoko and Harry Winks chosen on the flanks. \nHowever, it was Gent's starting line-up that was most bizarre. While the Belgians fielded their strongest XI, not one player had a shirt number between 1-11. \nIn fact, centre-back Stefan Mitrovic had the lowest jersey number at 13, with goalkeeper Lovre Kalinic possessing the highest at 91 and the average being 35. \nIt just looks ridiculous. Pictures from the game showed Samuel Gigot was wearing the No.4, but Gent's pre-match tweet clearly states his shirt number is 23. \nBut for a few eagle-eyed viewers, hardly anyone noticed Gent's strange number system (see below). TWITTER REACTS \nUnorthodox squad numbers are far from uncommon, of course, but for a whole starting XI to be missing numbers 1-11 is weird. \nSheffield Wednesday striker Steven Fletcher, for example, wears the No.6 for the Owls, whereas Morgan Schneiderlin wears No.5 at Everton. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
