Those places will continue to be successful but the gap between those and the more vulnerable, the more deprived areas, will get bigger. \n\"More businesses will decide to close in those areas that are not doing so well. The system is just not fit for purpose in the 21st century.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T14:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T10:58:39.540+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
