PA:Press Association \nAnd Chelsea and Liverpool offer proof. Keep up to date with ALL the Liverpool news, gossip, transfers and goals on our club page plus fixtures, results and live match commentary \nChelsea go into today’s clash with Arsenal ten points ahead of Jurgen Klopp’s Reds — but look at their records against so-called smaller teams. Both have lost just three games this season — Liverpool to Bournemouth , Burnley and Swansea , while Chelsea lost to Arsenal, Spurs and Liverpool. \nThe reason Klopp’s side have been picked off and Chelsea have ridden roughshod over the lesser lights is down, in part, to having double protection in the middle. They won’t leave themselves vulnerable when they lose the ball. \nJordan Henderson is good — but he’s not that good. He can’t do what Nemanja Matic and N’Golo Kante do together. \nAnd with your Sunderlands and Hulls, their midfields will sit deep because they see less of the ball — so they won’t be caught out of shape. Klopp speaks his passion to official in Liverpool v Chelsea game Sun 6 These graphics show Liverpool's average positions against Burnley and Man City \nFor Liverpool, only having Henderson doing that role leaves them horribly exposed down the flanks when the rest of the team bomb on. \nLook at our average position maps for Liverpool at Burnley, when they lost 2-0, and the huge areas of space behind the full-backs. \nThis is a freebie for teams to counter-attack. Henderson cannot get out and cover. \nIt’s a two-man job if the full-backs bomb on. \nNow look at the average position maps for their 1-0 win over Manchester City . They’re much deeper.

Against City, they had 43 per cent. \nIn fact, in Liverpool’s four highest possessions of the season they lost twice (Burnley 80% and Swansea 74%), drew one (Sunderland 71%) and beat (Hull 74%). They also let in eight goals. \nBy contrast, in their four lowest possessions of the season, they won three (City 43%, Chelsea 47% and Arsenal 49%) and drew with ( Manchester United 44%), conceding just five goals. \nThe point is that Liverpool are better when they’re playing on the counter against big teams. Reuters 6 Liverpool's current formation allows the likes of Adam Lallana to roam further forward \nThey know big clubs are going to come at them, so they end up playing as if they have two holding midfielders anyway. This provides balance. \nThe same applies in the cups. \nAgainst Southampton in the EFL Cup semi-finals, they had 68 and 72 per cent possession and lost both legs. And it was 79 per cent when losing to Wolves in the FA Cup. \nYou might ask why has this trend just started? Why were they flying early in the season? \nThe answer is timing. If they score early, the opposition tend to come out and Liverpool can sit in and be more secure — and strike on the break. Getty Images Someone like Emre Can would bring more balance to midfield and provide cover for the full-backs \nAgainst Leicester , they won 4-1, but scored on 13 minutes. \nThey beat Hull 5-1 but netted the opener in the 17th minute. \nIn the 2-1 win over West Brom , they scored on 20, at Crystal Palace when they won 4-2 it was 16, and Watford it was 6-1 after a 27th-minute goal. \nSo the majority of early-season wins when Liverpool looked like Premier League contenders were courtesy of early goals. Reuters 6 Lucas Leiva could also be the right man to make Liverpool more stable at the back \nAnd when they score early they have been happy to cough up the ball. Against West Brom, they had just 61 per cent possession. Against Palace, it was 50 and Watford 60. \nLiverpool are the league’s highest scorers but, at the back, they have conceded the joint-most in the top seven. \nThey have shipped 12 more than Chelsea and Spurs — a goal extra every two games. That makes winning the title tough. \nRefs were eager to clamp down on players holding this season. Liverpool seem to be clamping down on holding players — and it’s costing them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T05:54:49.670+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
