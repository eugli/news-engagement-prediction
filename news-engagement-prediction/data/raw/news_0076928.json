Rotimi-Akeredolu \nIn the judgment delivered by the then Chief Judge of the state, Justice Olasehinde Kumuyi, the court upheld the claims by Alarapon and 34 others, among who were some councilors, that the council officials were democratically elected to serve for a tenure of three years which would lapse on April 25, 2019. \nThe council leaders had approached the court to prevent the state government from dissolving, sacking, dethroning, impeaching or however removing the claimants from their respective positions, offices, duties, functions, powers and rights. \nThe claimants averred that anything to the contrary would contravene the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended.) \nIn granting the prayers of the local council chairmen and councilors, Kumuyi observed that the “tenure of an elected councilors or office holder cannot be abridged or determined at the whims or caprices of anyone one except the electorate.” Nwafor Polycarp ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T11:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T06:31:07.505+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
