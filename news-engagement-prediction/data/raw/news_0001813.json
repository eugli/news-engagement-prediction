This is a recognition for all the work done over the years for badminton ... for the nation,” said Chin Chai, who was the team manager when world No. 1 Lee Chong Wei won his second Olympic silver medal at the London Games in 2012. \nHe was also the team manager when Malaysia won three silver medals – through Chong Wei, Goh V Shem-Tan Wee Kiong (men’s doubles) and Chan Peng Soon-Goh Liu Ying (mixed doubles) – at the Rio Olympics last year. \nChin Chai represented Negri Sembilan as a badminton player from 1977-1993. He has served the state badminton association in Negri Sembilan and the BAM for over 30 years in different roles – from a coach to an administrator. \nNational doubles coach Jeremy Gan and world No. 1 men’s doubles pair Tan Wee Kiong-Goh V Shem were also awarded the Johan Mahkota Wilayah (JMW). \nFormer world junior champion Jeremy has overseen Wee Kiong-V Shem’s transformation from a struggling pair to world-class players in just two years. \nChin Chai was happy with the recognition bestowed on BAM’s administrator, coach and players. \n“It’s nice that our players and coach have also been recognised for their contributions and sacrifices,” said Chin Chai. \n“All the achievements in badminton is a collective effort by many parties. I must thank all the families, officials, players, fans and sponsors for their support.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T04:41:52.694+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
