The database will also capture Aadhar number of individual directors in the companies. \n\nA special task force with members from various regulatory ministries and enforcement agencies has been constituted to monitor the actions taken against deviant shell companies by various agencies. The concerned regulatory ministry will ensure that disciplinary actions are initiated against the professionals indulging in malpractices and abetting the operators of the shell companies. \n\nFollowing the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes in November last year, an analysis of shell companies revealed there were deposits to the tune of Rs 1,238 crore during the November-December period. \n\nMoreover, an investigation by the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) showed that as much as Rs 3,900 crore have been laundered by 559 persons with the help of 54 professionals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T04:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T17:43:11.386+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
