An Instagram post seemingly about Rainbow Brite-swatches of the upcoming Rock Candy Collection had some crucial info about the Kat Von D Studded Kiss Lipstick formula. You might remember that tattoo artist doing this before. In a prior post, she teased the launch of lip liners and a shimmery version of the Shade + Light palette in one of the longest captions ever. The details on the future of KVD's cult-favorite lipstick was buried in the second longest caption. First, Von D touched on the release of her colorful new lipsticks. Then, she got into the real talk. \"But more importantly, this will be my way of introducing you to the new and improved #StuddedKiss formula I will be introducing,\" she wrote in the caption. Wait, a second. A new Studded Kiss formula? Personally, I'm obsessed with Kat Von D's array of bold and neutral matte lipsticks. I fell in love with the shade range first (Piaf is my favorite), then realized the formula is pretty amazing for a matte in bullet form. Sure, it could be difficult to apply at times because the formula is on the drier side. However, I've never complained about it. I actually just told our senior digital editor, Deena Campbell , that the Kat Von D Studded Kiss formula was my favorite.

The current formula definitely lacks that quality. I just accepted that in the past as one of the pitfalls of matte lipstick. Now I know I shouldn't have settled.
