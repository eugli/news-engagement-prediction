USA TODAY Sports Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan (2) is sacked by New England Patriots defensive end Trey Flowers (98) during the first quarter during Super Bowl LI at NRG Stadium. (Photo: Kevin Jairaj, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWith Super Bowl LI in the books, it's never too early to take a look toward the future in the NFL. \nAfter a 34-28 overtime win by the New England Patriots over the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI, we decided to weigh each franchise's future. \nSo we asked our NFL staff: \nWhich team – the Falcons or Patriots – is mostly like to next hoist the Lombardi Trophy? Jarrett Bell \nPatriots. I mean, they've done this a few times. As long as Belichick and Brady are in the mix, they always have a chance. Atlanta now has something working against all the progress it has made in the hurdle to get beyond such a devastating loss. They had their shot and blew it. Nate Davis \nAtlanta is built for the long haul, with MVP Matt Ryan apparently just now entering his prime in Year 9, buoyed by the game’s best wideout (Julio Jones), top tailback tandem (Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman), a sturdy offensive line and a fast-flowing defense that will only get better with experience. And the Falcons really doesn’t have any major contract decisions to make until 2018. \nHowever … \nThe Patriots don’t have to contend with the Cowboys, Packers, Seahawks – or several other NFC teams that could quickly emerge as problematic – on the road to Super Bowl LII and beyond. So Tom Brady and Co. remain the better bet to imminently win another Lombardi Trophy. Lindsay H. Jones \nThe Falcons may have had the better overall roster in Super Bowl LI, but with questions about what the offense will look like after Kyle Shanahan's departure, there is no sure thing the Falcons offense will continue tearing up the league. The Patriots meanwhile, still have Tom Brady, the quarterback who Year after year erases other roster deficiencies. I fully expect that we'll see a 40-something Brady hoisting another Lombardi trophy soon, maybe even next year. Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz \nEven if the Falcons don't fall prey to the traditional Super Bowl hangover, they could have a treacherous go at repeating their run through the NFC. Kyle Shanahan is gone, and the offense could experience a step back. The young defense should mature, but the lack of depth was evident in Atlanta's collapse in the fourth quarter and overtime. And with a loaded conference (the Seattle Seahawks are the only NFC team in the last nine years with multiple Super Bowl appearances) and improving NFC South, the competition could easily catch up to Atlanta. \nThe Patriots, on the other hand, still stand well above the rest of the AFC. With Tom Brady having made the AFC Championship Game in 11 of his 15 years as a fully healthy starter, there's no reason to believe that the NFL's model of consistency won't be in position for a Super Bowl berth at the end of the season. And with the expected return of Rob Gronkowski and likely plenty of cap room to play with, the Patriots could be even stronger in several respects next season. Barring a calamitous injury or precipitous decline by Tom Brady, New England should be the choice here. Tom Pelissero \nI don’t think the more talented team won yesterday. You saw all the ascending young players – Tevin Coleman, Devonta Freeman, Taylor Gabriel, Austin Hooper, Grady Jarrett, Deion Jones, et al. – who made plays as the Falcons built that 25-point lead. They have a chance to be good for a while. But is anyone really betting against the Patriots at this point? They’re just so well-coached and, of course, have perhaps the greatest quarterback of all-time. Tom Brady turns 40 in August and I think he still might have one or two more titles in him. Lorenzo Reyes \nEverything inside me is saying the Patriots' run has to end soon, but I still can't count them out. Their biggest concern is the wave of key contributors ready to hit the open market — most notably cornerback Malcolm Butler, tight end Martellus Bennett, and linebacker Dont'a Hightower. Tight end Rob Gronkowski will be coming off of his third back surgery. But Tom Brady is still the greatest quarterback of all time and New England still has one of the premier coaching staffs in place with Bill Belichick and coordinators Josh McDaniels and Matt Patricia. \nThe impending loss of Falcons offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan worries me. I don't think it's a stretch to say Matt Ryan's numbers and impact won't be the same without Shanahan. I love the speed the Falcons have and they should complete for championships for years to come, but I'm not betting against Belichick and Brady. \nPHOTOS: Best of Super Bowl LI Facebook Posted!
