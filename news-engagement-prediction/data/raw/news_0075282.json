(AAP) Japan's Prime Minister spent Friday afternoon meditating while staff at some of the country's biggest firms quit work early - in time for a bit of shopping or maybe a boozy train ride. Source: Tweet \nWelcome to Premium Friday, Japan's latest bid to tackle two perennial problems - sluggish consumer spending and notoriously long working hours blamed for a national health crisis known as karoshi, or death from overwork. \nThe new work-life balance scheme, which launched this week, calls on employers to let staff off around 3:00 pm on the last Friday of every month.

Why children’s books that teach diversity are more important than ever If you think back to your childhood, what sticks with you? For many people, it’s those cosy times when they were cuddled up with a parent or grandparent, being read a story. \nMajor firms including automakers Nissan and Toyota, beverage giant Suntory and brokerage Nomura are taking part in the government-backed initiative. \nBut it's not mandatory and many companies have opted out, while some analysts question whether it will really boost spending or do much to change Japan's punishing work culture. \nStill, the idea was a hit with Suntory employee Maki Suzuki, who said she often works late into the night or even into the early hours when things are busy at the office. \n\"This is a good opportunity to plan something that we don't usually do,\" said the 34-year-old, as she visited a Tokyo art museum with colleagues Friday afternoon. \n\"Taking a long holiday is too high a hurdle for many Japanese, but taking an afternoon off isn't.\" \nWord has not reached out to some people, however. \n\"When I told my friends about Premium Friday, they were like, 'What are you talking about?'\" said Nami Kawasaki, another Suntory employee. \nMobile carrier SoftBank is letting its staff leave early and, from April, will put an extra 10,000 yen ($90) in their pockets a month. \nOther firms are jumping at the chance to sell things to workers with extra time on their hands. \nOne railway operator is offering a special train ride with beer and bento boxes, while early birds can get discounts on everything from matchmaking services to cancer checks. \nEmployees of Dai-ichi Life Insurance Co get ready for their early clock off.
