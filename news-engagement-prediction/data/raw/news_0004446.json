This felt a little more significant and risky,\" she said.\n\"But then I thought, how can we have a free exchange of ideas if some people are banned from attending?\"\nShe said that while the topics of racism and immigration are key parts of her scholarship, for her the decision to sign was personal.\n\"I can't help but think about my friend from Iran who is now a dean, and she can't go. When you start to really personalize it as your friends, colleagues, and students, it's everyone.\"\n'Some of us might face consequences' Shannon Walsh, an assistant professor in UBC's department of theatre and film, acknowledged she considered the sacrifice involved.\n\"There's some of the most important research institutes and universities in the world in the U.S., so it will definitely affect our work,\" she said.\n\"I think there is a large chance some of us might face consequences. But so many people don't have a choice about making this decision, so I think it's important we stand in solidarity with those people, whether or not it feels comfortable.\"\nKumari Beck, an associate professor in SFU's faculty of education, also said that despite her staunch opposition to the ban her decision to sign was \"complicated and difficult.\"\n\"On the one hand, my protest is not against the organizers of the conferences, it's against the U.S. administration. And will the administration even care about the fragmenting of the academic community?\"\nShe said, eventually, her desire to express her solidarity led her to sign.\n\"To restrict some people from carrying out their academic work is unacceptable. And so having weighed everything, I decided to sign hoping that the large numbers of academics signing onto this can be used by academic organizations in the U.S. to show how deeply damaging this is,\" she said.\nBeck said she's aware of two American conferences where organizers have committed to keeping the names of presenters in the programs as acknowledgement of their research, even for those who can no longer attend, or are choosing not to.\nUniversities speak up Canadian universities have also condemned the ban.\nUBC created a task force with a budget of $250,000 to support affected students and faculty. It said around 350 students and 50 faculty and staff at UBC are impacted by the order.\nThe University of Ottawa is waiving international fees for affected students, and offering visiting professorships to temporarily \"adopt\" American professors.\nUniversities Canada, which represents 97 schools across the country, said the immigration ban is already having a \"real, immediate and profound\" impact on research partnerships,\nA second online petition led by American academics denouncing the ban has collected more than 18,000 signatures, including 50 Nobel Laureates.", "external_links": ["https://docs.google.com/a/cbc.ca/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeNN_2HHREt1h-dm_CgWpFHw8NDPGLCkOwB4lLRFtKFJqI25w/viewform"], "published": "2017-02-03T22:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:11:26.547+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
