Chidambaram said the members can go ahead with their questions. \n\"We asked the commissioner about the situation, he said he would inform us by the afternoon over the action taken. However, before that it came out that an FIR has been lodged in the case of the student who was threatened,\" the member said. \nThe panel member said that Patnaik told them that the police is closely monitoring the situation and assured serious action. \nClashes took place at Delhi University's Ramjas college on February 22 after ABVP members forced the cancellation of a seminar and then disrupted a march. \nKaur, a student of Lady Shri Ram college, launched an online campaign against the ABVP, for which she received rape and death threats. She withdrew on from the campaign on Tuesday morning. \nShe has been provided police protection, and an FIR has been registered by Delhi police against unidentified perpetrators.
