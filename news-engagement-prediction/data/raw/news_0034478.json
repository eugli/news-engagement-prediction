TNN | Feb 12, 2017, 07.40 AM IST Dalai Lama with Aruna Bahuguna at the SVPNPA on Saturday. HYDERABAD: Islam is practised in many parts of the world, but it is the local culture that defines how tolerant or intolerant they are, said the Dalai lama at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy here on Saturday. \"The cultural heritage of the country or region plays a big role. For example, unlike the Muslims in China or other neighbours, those from India are peaceful and harmoniously co-exist with people of other faiths. It is the same religion but culture makes the difference,\" the Tibetan spiritual head told 139 IPS probationers and 15 officer trainees from Bhutan, Maldives and Nepal at the event. According to him, tolerance is automatically exhibited in regions where several religions co-exist. \"For example, in places like the Middle East, people have no contact with other religions. It is only when different religions mingle that tolerance becomes part of the ethos and people of different faiths live in harmony,\" he said. The Dalai Lama spoke on humanity, importance of religious harmony and necessity to develop and exhibit compassion to all humans regardless of religions or race. He expressed his admiration of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel for his decisive leadership and to the Indian Police for protecting the democratic set up of India. He acknowledged with gratitude the protection given to him by the Indian Police for the last 58 years. The Dalai Lama also recalled the great contribution provided by India towards developing the inner self. He mentioned as to how India can provide integration of modern technology with a harmonious inner self. He spoke about the development of the principles of 'Ahimsa' and 'Karuna' , that is non-violence and compassion. He spoke of how it is important to moderate belief by reason and not merely faith. He spoke of the need for revival of ancient Indian wisdom and the need for the education system to develop this.
