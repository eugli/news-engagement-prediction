Need to #ENDALZ more than ever. üôÅ \n‚Äî Kristen Cusato (@kristencusato) February 21, 2017 \nCassidy said that his mother‚Äôs memory and overall health got so bad that, toward the end, only a lone tear rolling down her face let him know that she recognized him as her son David. \n‚ÄúIn the end, the only way I knew she recognized me is with one single tear that would drop from her eye every time I walked into the room. ‚Ä¶ I feared I would end up that way.‚Äù \nDavid Cassidy said in his revealing interview that in addition to watching dementia destroy his mother‚Äôs mind, he also watched his grandfather struggle with the untreatable illness. Cassidy claims that coming to terms with his own dementia diagnosis has been a struggle and has taken some time. \n‚ÄúI was in denial, but a part of me always knew this was coming.‚Äù \nAs ET reports, it appears that David Cassidy‚Äôs humiliating Agoura Hills performance over the weekend may have been the moment when he realized he couldn‚Äôt continue to deny his diagnosis any longer. During the show, Cassidy couldn‚Äôt recall words to songs he‚Äôs been singing for five decades. \nThe on-stage humiliation, coupled with the public‚Äôs erroneous reasoning that Cassidy was likely under the influence of drugs or alcohol during the show seemingly prompted David to come clean about his dementia. Oh no‚Ä¶my teenage crush David Cassidy is fighting dementia (via @people ) #DavidCassidy #dementia #KeithPartridge pic.twitter.com/mk2fJprEC6 \n‚Äî MarieFranceRemillard (@MFRemillard) February 20, 2017 \nIn addition to admitting that he‚Äôs been secretly struggling with dementia, David Cassidy made a second announcement, this one involving the future of his musical career. \nDuring his California show over the weekend, Cassidy said a few slurred words about retirement, claiming that his Sunday show would be his last. However, as Fox News reports, at the time he made his comments, Cassidy was scheduled to continue touring until summer 2017. \nFollowing the announcement that he is battling dementia, Cassidy also announced that he is going to be ending his musical touring career. Rather than focusing on his profession, David Cassidy says that he wants to spend his remaining lucid time worrying about his ‚Äúhealth and happiness.‚Äù \n‚ÄúI want to focus on what I am, who I am and how I‚Äôve been without any distractions. I want to love. I want to enjoy life.‚Äù \nPrior to Monday‚Äôs dementia announcement, Cassidy had repeatedly found himself in trouble with the law as a result of his alleged alcohol and substance abuse issues. He was charged with DUIs in 2010, 2013 and 2014; just a month after his 2014 DUI, his wife filed for a divorce. Cassidy also spent some time in rehab in 2014. \nDespite his rehab stint, David Cassidy endured both a hit-and-run charge and personal bankruptcy in 2015. \nAt this time, it‚Äôs unknown what role dementia could have played in the legal trouble David Cassidy has dealt with over the last several years. \n[Featured Image by Rick Diamond/Getty Images]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T09:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:36:02.970+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
