Today, a tweet took this reckless rhetoric to the next level of authoritarianism. The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes , @NBCNews , @ABC , @CBS , @CNN ) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017 \nThat “enemy of the…people” language is straight out of the fascist playbook. I never thought I would hear a U.S. president say something so bluntly, viciously authoritarian in my lifetime. \nJournalists have responded to Trump’s attack with the hashtag #NotTheEnemy, which reminds Americans of the crucial public good that a free press provides, as well as the human cost of providing that service. \nSome of the tweets focused on historic precedent: excerpts from the Constitution, references to Nixon’s hatred of the press, and quotes from past presidents. This is Woodward and Bernstein. Nixon called them the enemy. They proved that no president is above the law. #NotTheEnemy pic.twitter.com/ekxoiBZis1 \n— Jim McGovern (@RepMcGovern) February 18, 2017 From ‘SEDITION, A FREE PRESS, AND PERSONAL RULE May 7, 1918’ \n— J.K.

It’s high time for someone in the White House to condemn and curb this language–but we all know that, unlike the journalists honored here, they don’t have the courage. \n(Via Twitter and The Huffington Post ; image via Warner Brothers Animation) \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T02:59:42.654+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
