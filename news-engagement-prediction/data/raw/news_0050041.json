And with filming beginning yesterday, he’s now revealed a first look at his primary cast — as well as let the world know that his contribution to the series will be a distinctly R-rated affair.\nPartial cast… beautiful human beings, good people. Also, killers. Cameras roll today. Follow me on Twitter for updates. Wish us luck. pic.twitter.com/vYGgGesW0Y \n— Shane Black (@BonafideBlack) February 20, 2017 \n\n\nWith the above tweet, Black debuted a promo shot of his leads, including (from left to right) Sterling K. Brown , Moonlight ’s Trevante Rhodes , Boyd Holbrook , Jacob Tremblay , Olivia Munn , and Keegan-Michael Key . It’s a formidable line-up boasting some of Hollywood’s fast-rising stars. And while Black has yet to reveal exactly how his film will fit into the franchise’s convoluted lore — encompassing the original Predator , Predator 2 , Predators , Alien vs. Predator, Alien vs. Predator: Requiem , and many comic book and video game adaptations — he did reconfirm (via the tweet below) what he told us late last year: namely, that he won’t be throwing any PG-13 punches. \nAnd, just to be clear… PG-13 is for pussies. Spines bleed… a lot.\n— Shane Black (@BonafideBlack) February 18, 2017 \n\n\nWhile rumors have suggested that The Predator will be set in an American suburb , there’s no official confirmation yet of exactly where the alien will be trying to collect his trophies this time around. Black did, however, already debut a (tongue-in-cheek) deleted scene from the film:\nPredators — deleted scene. pic.twitter.com/a28GxzCVdS \n— Shane Black (@BonafideBlack) February 19, 2017 \n\n\nThe Predator  is scheduled to arrive in theaters on Feb. 9, 2018.\nWatch: ‘The Predator’: Reboot De-Cloaks Itself With Teaser Poster, Here’s What We Know: \nRead more: \nThe History of ‘Star Wars’ at the Oscars  Jar Jar Binks’s Tragic Fate Laid Bare in New ‘Star Wars’ Novel ‘The Great Wall’ Star Matt Damon on Making Up That Accent and Getting Archery Tips From YouTube", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:18:29.640+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
