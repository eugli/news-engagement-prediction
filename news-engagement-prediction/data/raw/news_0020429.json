Courts must act fast!\" he wrote.\nEarlier in the day, during a visit to US Central Command in Tampa, Florida, Trump accused the media of downplaying the terror threat which his administration cites to justify its ban, saying they purposefully ignored jihadist atrocities.\nAsked to explain Trump's comments, White House spokesperson Sean Spicer promised to \"provide a list\" of attacks that had been \"underreported\".\nCourt 'erred'\nTrump's decree summarily denied entry to all refugees for 120 days, and travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days - a move critics charge will damage US interests. Refugees from Syria were blocked indefinitely.\nThe president says the ban is needed to tighten US security against foreign terror threats, citing the September 11, 2001 attacks despite the hijackers having no links to the named countries.\nIn its filing to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, the government argued that the federal court which temporarily rolled back Trump's directive had \"erred in entering an injunction barring enforcement of the order\", asking that the ban be reinstated.\nThe Justice Department argued that \"the executive order is a lawful exercise of the president's authority over the entry of aliens into the United States and the admission of refugees\".\n\"Even if some relief were appropriate, the court's sweeping nationwide injunction is vastly overbroad,\" it said.\nThe government again denied that the order specifically targets Muslims, defending it as a means to review and revise screening procedures in order to \"protect against terrorist attacks.\"\nAnd it said non-US citizens seeking to enter the United States for the first time have no constitutional rights to be upheld.\nMounting opposition\nFriday's decision by a federal judge in Seattle has allowed the many travelers who were suddenly barred from US soil to start trickling back in.\nThe State Department has said visa holders from the seven countries are allowed to travel to the US as long as their documents have not been \"physically cancelled\".\nOn Sunday, the appellate court refused to overrule the federal judge.\nAttorneys general for the states of Washington and Minnesota, which won the temporary stay of the ban, have asked the appeals court to refuse to reinstate it. They were backed Monday in a court brief filed by attorneys general from 16 other US states.\nSeveral legal and rights groups have filed in support of the states, including the Southern Poverty Law Center, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the American Civil Liberties Union.\nAnd in an additional blow, a slew of Silicon Valley giants led by Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter have filed a brief in support of the lawsuit, arguing that the ban threatens their ability to attract crucial foreign talent and investment to the United States.\nTesla and SpaceX were among another 30 companies that added their names to the filing late on Monday, pushing the total to more than 120.\nA group of prominent Democrats including former secretaries of state John Kerry and Madeleine Albright added their voices to the criticism, arguing that Trump's ban could endanger US troops in the field, disrupt counterterrorism cooperation and feed Islamic State group propaganda.\nSpicer insisted the administration was \"absolutely not\" planning to back down on its plan for extreme vetting at US borders, saying: \"Once we win the case, it will go right back into action.\"\nBut top Republicans have shown renewed signs of discomfort with the president as the controversy escalates - specifically over Trump's virulent attacks on James Robart, the Seattle federal judge.", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/News24/World/Articles&sz=600x50&c=1342777923&t=artid%3de308d03f-8424-45ed-93a0-b30abda14d69%26People%3ddonald+trump%26Places%3dus%26Topics%3drefugees%26accreditation%3dafp%26posno%3d1", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/News24/World/Articles&sz=600x50&c=1342777923&t=artid%3de308d03f-8424-45ed-93a0-b30abda14d69%26People%3ddonald+trump%26Places%3dus%26Topics%3drefugees%26accreditation%3dafp%26posno%3d1"], "published": "2017-02-07T06:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T11:00:31.414+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
