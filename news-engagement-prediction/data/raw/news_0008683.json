But when the district attorney lobs new accusations, everyone could be in danger. Below, Weil teases what’s next: \nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: How is Bonnie going to deal with representing Annalise? Will that pressure start to get to her? LIZA WEIL: It’s a lot. There’s a lot of things in play. I do think that, in some ways, this is a role that Bonnie has wanted to step into for quite some time — maybe not literally representing Annalise, but being able to be in court, be strong and have Annalise’s belief in her. Unfortunately, she really doesn’t have any of those things. She’s doing the best that she can. But she’s up against quite a few obstacles. Bonnie is going to quickly discover that Frank has now confessed to Wes’ murder. Now she’s going to have to figure out how to proceed with defending Annalise. Although Frank taking the fall was something that was previously discussed between Bonnie and Frank, I do think it’s very much a shock to her and it does leave her even more alone in having to take care of everything and everyone. Anxieties and suspicions are running at an all-time high. I don’t know how she’s doing it. It’s deeply upsetting to see her having to navigate all this stuff, because she’s got a bum deal. \nYou would think Frank’s confession would be good news, but will it actually make her case a little more difficult? And make her more torn between these two very important people in her life? Yes, yes to all of that. It just gives her more stuff to do now. It’s not as helpful. Part of that is because I don’t know if Bonnie is entirely convinced that she knows everything. Although it was a bee that was put in his bonnet about taking the fall, it’s now complicated by whether he’s legitimately confessing. That’s still something that everyone is questioning because he’s not very forthcoming and entirely honest with what he’s up to. It just becomes more of a complication. \nBonnie suspects Hannah Keating (Marcia Gay Harden) is at fault. Will she delve further into that in coming weeks? Or is it all about the Mahoneys? Bonnie is diving into any feasible suspect. So much is happening so fast now. These characters are learning more and more, and the conspiracy appears to be getting deeper and deeper. She’s just trying to keep her head above water and really explore any leads that she can. Yeah, I would say she’s not discounting any of those people. \nWe know Nate is falling in the middle right now. What does that push-pull with Bonnie look like? Last week, we saw that scene in the car where he offers immunity. It’s a real heartbreaker for Bonnie because I think she was excited to have him to depend on. Without his help and cooperation, it’s tricky. They’re not necessarily moving in the same circles, but it’ll be interesting to see how Nate is navigating all of this on his own. But I think for Bonnie, she’s like, “Boy bye.” [ Laughs. ] \nThe K4 is going to find out that the D.A.’s investigation is much bigger than they imagined. Does that put everyone in danger? Yeah, of course it does! \nShould we be worried that every bad thing they’ve done on the show thus far is going to come out? Yes, it gets very, very scary, very, very fast. \nThe D.A. going to bring another charge against Annalise. What can you tease? It’s not good. [ Laughs. ] It’s a real doozy. It’s not one that they saw coming. It’s an obstacle. \nWill the show address Bonnie and Annalise’s kiss ? How has that changed their relationship? I think so many things are ever-changing with their relationship. That dynamic shifts so much. That kiss, right now, is probably not in the forefront of their brains. They’re in survival mode now. Yeah, history would tell us that boundaries are blurred with that relationship. I personally hope that’s something that we get to explore in the future. \nHow to Get Away with Murder airs Thursdays at 10 p.m. ET on ABC.
