And if we have a red carpet, I’ll be like, ‘Can I take care of that?” \n“He’s going to kill me,” she joked. \nBut it turns out that the mother of 1-year-old Isaiah Michael Fisher is the perfect person to ask for a quick makeover.

The lights are so harsh you can kind of just get away with wearing a lot. And I like that. I’m good at putting a lot of makeup on my face.” \nUnderwood also cuts her own hair “semi-regularly,” but she too can go a little overboard with the scissors. \n“It’s a never-ending cycle of badness,” she added.

The country crooner told PEOPLE Magazine she was going on a break to focus on her family. \nCARRIE UNDERWOOD SURPRISES MILITARY FAMILY \n“I’m really excited about that, because you don’t know where you’re going to go,” she said. \n“I’m nervous because I want whatever I do next time to be amazing, so I’m kind of taking a little break right now and being a mom and being a wife and going to see some hockey games to see my husband play. I’m kind of waiting for lightning to strike and go: ‘Okay, it’s time to get creative and work on new music!’” Advertisement ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T12:17:51.316+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
