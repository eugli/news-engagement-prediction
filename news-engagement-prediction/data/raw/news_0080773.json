It has a script on par with a fun sci-fi matinee, arguably the most polished visuals on a home console, and combat that amounts to more than shooting hundreds of dudes in the face. But I do wish I’d known more about the game’s idiosyncrasies before I played. \nDespite a lengthy tutorial prologue, many of Horizon ’s most useful tips and tools are buried in the game’s opaque menus or mentioned offhand in text blurbs that appear on loading screens. I think my time with the game would have been better with a handful of pointers. \nThese are the lessons I learned in my playthrough, free of any major story spoilers. I’ve ordered the tips as they’re needed in the game’s timeline, so don’t feel pressured to remember every note at once. Think of this as a tour guide, something to take on your journey, directing you in interesting and useful directions.\nPhoto: Horizon Zero Dawn Beginner’s advice: Commercials sell Horizon as if it’s Assassin’s Creed with guns, explosions, and robot dinosaurs, but the game is slower than that marketing suggests. A three-hour-long prologue introduces Aloy; her father figure Rost; the politics of her tribe, the Nora; and the fundamentals of how to collect materials, hunt beasts, and craft ammunition and upgrades. The intro is leisurely for good reason: it needs to establish a narrative foundation enough to withstand innumerable sequels. Which brings me to my one big note... \nRecalibrate your expectations This isn’t a traditional action game. It likes to think through its ideas, and spend time with its characters.\nAnd when the game does switch its emphasis from words to action, the combat doesn’t regurgitate the traditional formula of swapping between increasingly powerful guns. Much of the game’s weaponry is designed to suppress rather the damage. The ropecaster lasso beats and pins them to the ground. A slingshot fires ice and electricity projectiles that stun and freeze on impact. \nIf anything, the game punishes a guns-blazing attitude. The player is often outmatched and underpowered, and so the best path to victory involves scouting a battlefield, stealthily picking off weaker targets, and taking advantage of the weaknesses of the bigger beasts. It’s a more strategic and thoughtful game than it leads on.\nPlay how you like That said, you can choose to play as a brutal murder machine. If you find one method for downing a humongous rob-hawk to be tedious, try another. Maybe you should tie it to the ground. Maybe you should unlock the power to turn into an ally. Or maybe you should just pelt it with a half-dozen flaming wars. Even if your hunting methods seem to work well, there’s often a reward in questioning your strategic assumptions. How I approached a scrimmage at the end of the game was totally different than how I started it.\nPhoto: Horizon Zero Dawn General tips: Free sample box at every t rader A number of helpful and sometimes free items are buried in the menus at trader stations. For example, under the “treasure box” window, every trader offers one free sample box. When you’re low on supplies in the first few hours, these freebies are lifesavers.\nUse the map to locate quests The game lets you select one quest and one waypoint at a time. On one hand, I’m glad it doesn’t let me litter the screen with icons egging me on in every direction. On the other hand, it’s a pain to walk a few miles, only to realize you passed a few side quest objectives on the way. The trick is to check your map before a long trip. All quests are marked on the map with diamond icons. Rather than select one long route to a main quest, I’d tie together a few sub-routes connecting secondary tasks.\nPhoto: Horizon Zero Dawn Regularly stop at campfires to save your game Horizon ’s interface is vague about when it auto-saves. The one method for manually saving is visiting campfires. There are dozens of camps on the map, usually a short run from anywhere you need to go. To be safe, stop by a fire and tap the triangle button to force a quick save.\nFast travel to camp fires Traveling on foot is useful for gathering resources and locating hidden item caches, but sometimes you’ll want to cut to the chase. Once you’ve discover a camp fire (it will appear as green on the map) you can fast travel to the location. To fast travel, simply open the map menu, select a discovered campfire, and hold R2. Each fast travel requires a fast travel token. I’ll get to the more sustainable solution in a moment.\nPhoto: Horizon Zero Dawn Hunting: Scan animals Each beast is made of different components, many of which have their own weakness and some of which can be removed entirely. Approach a collection of enemies in a crouch stance, hide in the weeds, and use the focus to mark enemies, gauge weakness, and plan the attack. For example...\n“ Freeze ” stalls enemies and increases damage If beast is vulnerable to freeze, a few icy arrows or snow grenades, followed by a volley of explosives or fire arrows can bring down midrange creatures.\n“ Tear ” helps to steal weapons from machines Most high-range creatures have heavy weaponry bolted to their sides and spine. A weapon with strong tear (represented by a shield icon) can knock weapons loose. Aloy can then grab the weaponry and use it against enemies. This method is stupidly useful — mounted weapons are the most powerful options in the game — and I can’t believe it took me 20 hours to catch on to the technique.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T17:10:44.372+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
