I would like to make it clear that the only truth in that is the separation and rest all is untrue. The reason behind the separation is unknown to anyone but me,\" Vijay had said in a statement last year.\nHe had also clarified that he was not separating from Amala because his family doesn't support her decision to continue acting in films.\n\"I'm conscious about my social responsibility; I have so far directed 9 films. I have always portrayed women in my films with dignity and self respect, and it reflects the amount of respect I have towards them. I strongly advocate women and their freedom of choice,\" he had said.\n\"When Amala wanted to continue her career in films, I supported her to the best of my ability. And she continued acting even after marriage. The new found accusation that I or my family was stopping her from work is completely untrue,\" he had added.\nVIPs AT VIJAY-AMALA PAUL MARRIAGE – PHOTO GALLERY http://t.co/ovClAT5EKe @amalapaul_FC @Amala_AmsFans pic.twitter.com/o6iD5jxuHH \n— Adhi Bagavan (@AdhiTheGreat) June 12, 2014 Explaining what led to the separation, Vijay had earlier said, \"The base for any marital relationship is honesty and trust and when that is breached the very existence of committed relationship becomes meaningless.\"\n\"I really value the institution of marriage and relationship a lot. Not even in my worst dreams, did I think it will end. But yes, today I don't have any choice. With lot of pain in my heart, I have decided to move on in life in a dignified manner,\" he had said.\nThe couple had first teamed up for the film 'Deiva Thirumagal' which had actor Vikram in the lead role.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T12:14:47.591+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
