The Shiv Sena had won 75 of the 227 seats last time, with the BJP winning 31, the Congress 52 and the NCP 13. \nThe big poll focus will be on 227-member Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), retaining control of which is vital for Shiv Sena as the city has remained its prime political space ever since the party's formation in 1966.   14:21 More from zeenews", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T11:19:28.173+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
