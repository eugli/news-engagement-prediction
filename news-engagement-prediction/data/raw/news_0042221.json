Tamil Nadu's politics. His Twitter timeline is a testimony to that. He has been tweeting old photos of Jayalalithaa and Sasikala and taking digs at Sasikala every now and then. \nLast night, he announced that he's making a film on the politician. He had a poster ready too.

So, RGV (at least from what we could decipher from that tweet that sounded more like a secret code than a sentence) is making the movie ONLY for Sasikala's family. Eh? \nA few minutes later he tweeted this: I somehow have this very extremely strong feeling that Jayalalitha's spirit will come into Sasikala's jail cell and ‚Äî Ram Gopal Varma (@RGVzoomin) February 16, 2017 \nAnd? Well he didn't finish that sentence. And we are not even sure if this is the plot of his movie anymore. But we are hoping it's not a remake of 'Phoonk' , or 'Bhoot' or even 'Darna Zaroori Hai' . \nA few minutes later, RGV tweeted that he has insight of what went wrong between Jayalalithaa and Sasikala. Apparently, the servants of Poes garden revealed it to him. Truth behind Jayalalitha and Sasikala relationship,what Poes garden servants told me is unimaginably shocking and I wil show it in my film pic.twitter.com/YocWWyiTUQ ‚Äî Ram Gopal Varma (@RGVzoomin) February 16, 2017 \nBy the time you reach the fourth tweet, you realise RGV must be spending a lot of time hanging out outside the late Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa's posh house 36 Poes Garden residence.

Last year in December, RGV had announced that he has registered his new movie titled 'Shashikala'--which is the story of a very dearest closest friend of a politician and 'completely fictional'. \n\"'Shashikala' is going to be a very very sincere from the heart Tamilan love story and absolutely nothing to with fictional non politics,\" he had tweeted then. \nHis latest tweets, however, talks about a completely different plot. \nWe just need to wait and watch out for his next series of tweets to figure this mystery out. \nAlso see on HuffPost: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T15:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T03:52:58.229+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
