February 15, 2017 9:56pm You’ve got to hand it to Obama’s White House photographer. He knows how to throw shade. Gavin Fernando news.com.au @GavinDFernando \nDONALD Trump came under scrutiny yesterday over his response to a breaking security crisis. \nAfter news of North Korea firing off a missile broke during a private party, the President began discussing sensitive details of the incident in plain view of other attendees . \nSecurity analysts slammed the move based on the closeness of the public to the sensitive discussion, and the proximity of smartphones which could be hacked. \nWhat you may have missed in all this was a subtle Instagram post by Pete Souza, the former White House photographer for Barack Obama. \nMr Souza posted a seemingly-innocuous throwback to Mr Obama amid a discussion in El Salvador relating to national security. A post shared by Pete Souza (@petesouza) on Feb 13, 2017 at 1:39pm PST \n“When we were on the road, national security discussions and head of state phone calls were conducted in a private, secure location set up on-site,” Mr Souza wrote. “Everyone had to leave their BlackBerry outside the area. \n“In this photo, which was taken in March 2011 and subsequently released, the President holds a discussion in El Salvador following a conference call with his full national security team.” \nThe photo was posted mere hours after news outlets got wind of Mr Trump’s response to a crisis. \nJudging by the thousands of comments on his post, most people believe Mr Souza’s timing was a deliberate attempt to paint Mr Trump in a negative light next to his predecessor. \nUser darrylponting wrote: “I love this, keep them coming. People didn’t realise how high Obama set the bar until this farcical team took office. I love that you captured these moments and were able to share them after.” \nlexytheblasian said: “Best troll account ever, and I mean that in the most hilarious but on-point way possible. Keep ‘em coming!” \nmainelysam simply commented: “Love the shade.” \nNow, sure, we could potentially write off the timing of that one photo as a coincidence. \nBut the photographer has gained a reputation for throwing shade at the new US leader for several weeks now. \nLet’s start with another subtle example from yesterday. \nThis photo in particular - which features Mr Trump extending his hand and Mr Trudeau staring down at it with reluctance - was “memed” to high heaven. Catch the memes of this photo? Source: AFP \nMr Souza posted a photo that same day of Mr Obama standing in the Oval Office with Mr Trudeau - both leaders looking completely at ease. \nThe post was simply captioned: “Allies.” A post shared by Pete Souza (@petesouza) on Feb 13, 2017 at 12:50pm PST", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T08:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T13:08:20.319+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
