He wasn't talking except to the police. He looked quite shaken up,\" she said. \nMr Lespes described the encounter as \"just unreal\". \n\"You would never think this kind of thing can happen to you. It happened in like, 10 seconds,\" he said. Passengers tracked carjacker with app \nThe passengers were able to track the carjacker using the Uber app for five minutes, but lost the signal because he may have thrown the Uber driver's phone out the window. \nUber spokesperson Mike Scott said the company had reached out to the driver to check on his wellbeing and offer support. \nPolice have described the offender as a Caucasian male in his 40s with short brown hair, a stubble beard and wearing a black jacket. \nThe stolen car with the registration 163VWP remains missing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T14:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T09:32:38.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
