Next you know, they’ll sign Adrian Peterson. \nThey are easily becoming one of the most fraud teams in the league. Feb 9, 2017 4:59 PM \njust needs some of Pete’s special brew and he’ll be good again. minson15 says: Feb 9, 2017 5:00 PM \nI think this is hilarious! I like Walsh and not because he missed that kick for us to win the game, but he was really good until that missed kick. Hopefully he can kick XPs better than Hauska. maust1013 says: Feb 9, 2017 5:03 PM \nAnd just like that the 12’s are making their reservations for SB LII and Walsh’s triumphal return to MN! But how will squaw accept the signing of yet another white kicker? jgedgar70 says: Feb 9, 2017 5:04 PM \nHe would have been better off signing with a team that plays in a dome. DrSteveBrule says: Feb 9, 2017 5:06 PM \nWalsh was 1st team all-pro his rookie year. There was a time before the Seahawks signed him when Steven Hauschka was “kicked” around the league. Kicking for the Vikings, Ravens, Lions, Broncos, and even the UFL before he played for going to Seahawks. skawh says: Feb 9, 2017 5:07 PM \nGood move. Cheaper than Hauschka, and couldn’t be any worse than Hauschka was last year. whatjusthapped says: Feb 9, 2017 5:09 PM \nHe will be an All Pro again. He just happened to be wearing a purple uniform and with that comes a choking legacy. No matter the opponent, no matter where it is in the playoffs, the Vikings will find a way to lose so its hardly Walsh’s fault, he was just making the latest contribution to the legacy. steves11 says: Feb 9, 2017 5:10 PM \nA fresh start may be all he needs to get back on track. No good reason why a career should be ruined essentially because of one missed kick. Feb 9, 2017 5:12 PM \nFeel good story of the offseason. \nThanks for the wonderful memories, Blair. imodan says: Feb 9, 2017 5:12 PM \nThe Patriots should be looking for a kicker too. I was praying to the football god’s that the game wouldn’t come down to a Gostkowski kick and it didn’t. He too has lost his confidence since the missed extra point last year in the AFCCG. Thanks for all you did Steve but this is business and you’ve become a liability and liabilities need to be addressed. toybkshr says: Feb 9, 2017 5:13 PM \nI guess it’s the Hawks way of thanking him for the missed kick postintelligence says: Feb 9, 2017 5:17 PM \nThat’s interesting. I hope the eventual outcome of this signing isn’t a memorable missed kick in a playoff game against the Vikes. seahawkfanfrom1970s says: Feb 9, 2017 5:18 PM \nI hope they have a backup plan to this backup plan. nathanp2013 says: Feb 9, 2017 5:19 PM \nKickers that miss big kicks are followed by them forever. As a Viking fan… he seems like too good of a guy to deserve that. macneil4025 says: Feb 9, 2017 5:21 PM \nBlair has a huge leg, just mentally a nutcase, I bet Pete turns him around, win win for both Vikes and Chickens! Skol fartweasel says: Feb 9, 2017 5:24 PM \nHe lost any/all confidence in his ability when he shanked that kick against the Seahawks. You could see it in his face every time he kicked after that. \nTruly wish him the best, but when they need him the most, chances are that’s when he’ll be at his worst. \nGood luck. Jeremy Karp says: Feb 9, 2017 5:28 PM \nI mean, he did already win a playoff game for them. So, it makes sense to sign him. derik72090 says: Feb 9, 2017 5:29 PM \nDon’t know how anyone could trust this guy’s leg again. His misses aren’t just misses…they’re w de misses. Wouldn’t be too excited if I were a Seahawks fan. Feb 9, 2017 5:29 PM \nGreat idea…if he gets hot. Save a couple mil from extra point shaky Housh.
