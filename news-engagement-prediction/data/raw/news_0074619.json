Yet the Pacers could not persuade another team to exchange a valuable player to boost their roster by surrendering their best draft pick. \nMuch of the Pacers’ conversations with teams were overshadowed by the possibility of the Boston Celtics acquiring George. For much of the past two days, the Celtics engaged in talks with the Pacers to see what it would take for Bird to trade George. Ultimately, Bird decided to not deal George with the hope the franchise can convince their star player to re-sign with team after his expected opt-out at the end of the 2017-18 season.
