(David J. Phillip/AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated:  29 PM \nThere's a football game to be played on Sunday, and it matters far more than any airport protest for civil rights and any careful, thoughtful analysis of travel bans. There's a football game to be played on Sunday, and it's the most relevant thing going on in the world today, demanding complete tunnel vision to orchestrate. \nThis is a glimpse into Roger Goodell's world, apparently, a world full of facts and numbers and Deflategate nitpicking, a world in which, for more than $30 million a year, he gets to plan out a silly game and doesn't need to pay any attention at all to the problems of any of those below him, whether they be players or coaches or fans or nation. \nThis was Roger Goodell, esteemed NFL commissioner, on Wednesday afternoon, during his yearly pre-Super Bowl press conference, serving as mascot for both insensitive sports league and ever-growing class divide in the United States, when he was asked about President Donald Trump's recently enacted immigration ban, a ban that's been met by consternation, anger and protest by those who have never had to truly matter to Roger Freaking Goodell. \n\"We're aware of the conversations that are going on and the division,\" he said, detached as always. \"As commissioner of the NFL, I'm singularly focused on the Super Bowl.\" \nOdell Beckham praised for ‘professionalism’ during Pro Bowl \nJust in case you didn't understand that he cares only for your dollars and undying devotion to his league, NFL fans, he went on. \n\"We have a unique position to have an event on Sunday that will bring the world together,\" he added. \"They will have an opportunity to be entertained. That's something we feel very proud of. That's something we will continue to be focused on through this game.\" \nWelcome to another peek inside the lives of America's insanely filthy-rich, a group so insulated from the madness and insanity wrought by Donald Trump that it can ignore the problems of everyday Americans whenever it so chooses. Welcome to another peek inside the mindset of the league that operates free of empathy and understanding — for fans, players and even the most pressing (to the rest of us) current events. \nWelcome to the final week of the NFL monolith that we've all created with our insatiable addiction to a deteriorating product that shatters players’ bones but will still collect innumerable eyeballs on Sunday night, when Democrats and Republicans and protesters and Donald Trump alike almost certainly all tune in. There may be an opportunity to help propel a clearly hurting country toward some form of unity, except Goodell can't see that past the Nielsens and attendance numbers and PSI. \nGoodell only has self to blame for bad relationship with Patriots \nGoodell and the NFL's even more affluent owners don't owe it to anyone to condemn Trump's immigration ban. But the NFL's handling of all things Trump has been insulting thus far. \nAccording to the New York Times, the league went out of its way to scrub any quotes involving Trump from NFL transcripts on Super Bowl Media Night on Monday. The league, through spokesman Brian McCarthy, said that \"there's no editing of these quotes,\" although their absence was obviously noticed by media. Goodell with President Trump and the First Lady. (BFA/Billy Farrell/BFAnyc/Sipa USA) \nAnd now Goodell pitches the Super Bowl as an important distraction that requires his complete \"focus\", saying it can bring \"the world together,\" at a time when entertainment is nobody's priority. Really? \nGoodell says this even though the NFL was a battleground for conversation and racial inequality and politics and Trump all season, fueled by Colin Kaepernick's persistent national anthem protest. \nRoger Goodell says he isn’t hiding from Patriots or their fans \nThus Roger Goodell focuses on his game, even though the NFL was a battleground for conversation and racial inequality and politics and Trump all season, fueled by Colin Kaepernick's persistent national anthem protest. \nEven though this most recent ban could have ripple effects for several Muslim players in the NFL, such as the Jets' Mo Wilkerson and the Steelers' Ryan Harris. \nAnd even though, on Sunday night, a Falcon, receiver Mohamed Sanu, will play in Super Bowl LI just days after all these current events were clearly weighing on him during Super Bowl Media Night. \nNo, Roger Goodell, who will neither play nor coach in Sunday's game, has to \"focus\" on his role as glorified Super Bowl LI party planner for the rest of this week, has to take a few more limos and eat some more lavish meals, and has to continue to stay out of Donald Trump's way, because that might be bad for business. \nSo it's New England Patriots vs. Atlanta Falcons on Sunday night at NRG Stadium. \nAnd when you're the $30 million-a-year commissioner, that's all that needs to matter.
