You can't tell on the surface, but the crater -- about 5 miles wide and known as the Des Plaines Disturbance -- lies hundreds of feet underground.\nWhat we know about the impact 5 miles\nApproximate\ncrater location\n90\nDes\nPlaines\n355\n294\nChicago\n290\n5 miles\nApproximate\ncrater location\n90\nDes\nPlaines\n355\nChicago\n294\n290\n5 miles\nApproximate\ncrater location\n90\nDes\nPlaines\n355\nChicago\n294\nWhen did it happen? Scentists don't know, exactly, but you can narrow it down to a 300-million year timeframe, Monson said. The oldest the impact could be dates back to the Pennsylvanian Period in the geologic time scale, 299 million to 323 millions years ago. The youngest it could be is about 2 million years, when advancing glaciers covered the crater.\nDes\nPlaines\nmeteor:\nTrump\nTower:\nAround\n1,300 feet\nin diameter\n1,389\nfeet tall\nHow large was the meteor? It's hard to know for sure, but Monson estimates the object might have been about 1,300 feet across. That's about as tall as Trump Tower. A more accurate estimate needs more information, such as the composition of the meteorite and how fast it was going when it hit the surface.\nCan you see the crater on the surface? No. About 2 million years ago the area was covered by glaciers, burying the crater under 75 to 200 feet of debris deposited by the ice. Also, after impact the crater wouldn't have had the familiar bowl shape, Monson said. When the surface rock was removed by the explosion, it caused older, deeper rock to rebound, pushing up and forming a peak in the center.\nHow was it discovered? Well drillers noticed anomalies in the rock back in the late 1800s, Monson said, but it wasn't known that a meteor impact caused the faults until the mid-20th Century.\nWhat happened after the meteor hit? The amount of energy released would have been comparable to several thousand hydrogen bombs exploding at once, Monson said, damaging rock more than a mile below the surface. The impact would have created a fireball along with a shock wave and earthquake.\nHow often do these impacts occur? Meteor strikes the size of the Des Plaines impact occur every 60,000 years or so, Monson said, citing a 1998 book by a Smithsonian researcher. Though this seems rare -- and other researchers might give different frequencies -- the colossal length of the geologic time scale means the impacts add up, and craters can be found throughout the Midwest.\nIn Illinois, the Glasford Structure in Peoria County is studied by the Illinois State Geological Survey, and in Iowa, the the Manson Crater is one of the largest impact structures on the continent. There are 190 confirmed meteor craters in the Earth Impact Database, maintained by the Planetary and Space Science Centre at the University of New Brunswick, Canada. But there are likely many more, Monson said. Meteors could hit the deep ocean and leave no crater, or the craters could be covered up or destroyed by erosion.\nMap data via Geologic Atlas of Cook County, 2004\nCopyright Â© 2017, Chicago Tribune", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5899f559/turbine/ct-des-plaines-disturbance-20170207", "http://www.isgs.illinois.edu/sites/isgs/files/maps/county-maps/cook-ga.pdf"], "published": "2017-02-07T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:19:36.853+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
