If a person crosses somewhere else and gets apprehended on Canadian soil, they can apply as a refugee and the case is heard by Canadian authorities.\nSome immigration lawyers and politicians want Canada to change the agreement so that people can turn themselves in at official border crossings and still get their refugee claim heard.\nThe reeve of Emerson-Franklin, Greg Janzen, said Tuesday the idea would increase safety for his community's residents and for the refugees, who have been making long crossings on foot in the dead of winter.\n\"I would like to see something changed and get some order to this chaos that's going on,\" Janzen said.\n\"Let them walk up to the port of entry. Will that bring more people? Yes. But at least it will be in an organized manner.\"\nPallister was non-committal on the issue. He said there are arguments for and against changing the Canada-U.S. Safe Third Country Agreement.\nIn Ottawa, federal Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen said he sees no need to change the agreement, because the United States was still living up to its international obligations in dealing with asylum-seekers.\n\"As far as we're concerned, someone in the United States can still make a credible asylum claim through their system,\" Hussen told reporters.\nPallister would not specify what he is seeking from the federal government. He said he is putting those details in a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\"I think we have to have the dialogue (first) and we should endeavour to do that co-operatively with the federal government.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:10:16.687+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
