As we wait to see how that debate plays out in the weeks and months ahead, there is a sense among some that we may be closing the proverbial barn door after the horse has run. \nSome argue that there are people already in the US, whose words and deeds on behalf of foreign powers critically threaten America and its allies. Iran is one of the countries named in the President's Executive Action. It goes without saying that the Islamic Republic of Iran remains the number one state sponsor of terrorism according to the State Department. \nHowever, more fundamentally, some think that the focus should also be on the threat coming from a well-knit group and gilded circle of the Islamic Republic of Iran's operatives or lobbyists, who are determined to satisfy their paymaster by cajoling, prodding and persuading US policy-makers into believing that appeasement, lifting of sanctions on IRGC, and a soft touch is the only way to contain the top state sponsor of terrorism. But appeasement policies have not worked, any reasonable observer will interject. \nAs Michael Flynn wrote \"Every day we see evidence of Iranian espionage in the United States...\". Some believe that some of Iran's lobbyists and operatives work or lobby illegally without registration in plain sights while other act less conspicuously in every critical sector of the American society. \nSome believe that they can ill-afford to allow their presence among them, and in particular their access to our politicians and officials. And finally, they believe that Iranian agents pose a real and present danger and they should be dealt with swiftly and decisively.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T11:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T06:45:19.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
