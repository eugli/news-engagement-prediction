If the name doesn’t sound THAT familiar to you, it’s because he had to sit out all of his sophomore season with a suspension. But he’s back this year and already putting the entire lacrosse world on notice with this goal. Fooled pretty much everybody except for the camera man with this one. \nI mean… that poor goalie. Pretty disrespectful for a Canadian to treat the future American Armed Forces like that. But what a goal. It’s week 1 of the 2017 College Lacrosse season and we’re already getting A1 hidden ball trick goals. Buckle up, folks. Gonna be a helluva ride this year. \nP.S. – Is Joel Tinney a better swimmer than Michael Phelps?
