Alex Ford, chief executive of the charity, said: 'This dreadful disease is set to become one of the big four cancer killers in less than 10 years because we have not made the vital breakthroughs in early diagnosis methods that are so desperately needed to allow patients and families more precious time together. The charity are calling for the UK Government and other major research funders to invest £25million per year in pancreatic cancer research by 2022 'And if we don't act now, the number of lives stolen by the disease will increase by over a quarter by 2026 in the UK. WHAT IS PANCREATIC CANCER? Pancreatic cancer is caused by the abnormal and uncontrolled growth of cells in the pancreas - a large gland in the digestive system. Around half of all new cases occur in people aged 75 or older, with one in 10 being genetic. Other causes include age, smoking and other health conditions, including diabetes. It is difficult to treat as it rarely causes any symptoms in the early stages, so it's often not detected until the cancer is fairly advanced. Source: NHS Choices 'We will lead a revolution for people affected, by funding research to allow more patients to be diagnosed earlier, when potentially life-saving surgery is possible.' He added: 'We will also focus on discovering new treatments, exploring the potential of personalised medicine and ensuring patients get the best treatment now. 'But it is crucial the Government and other major research funders join us and make pancreatic cancer research a priority today. 'It is only by taking on this tough disease together that we can make the long-overdue progress which will truly transform the future for patients and families.' This comes after scientists found that pairing two chemotherapy drugs together dramatically increases the survival rates of those living with pancreatic cancer. Last month, the study by the University of Liverpool, showed that 29 per cent of patients receiving gemcitabine and capecitabine lived at least five years.
