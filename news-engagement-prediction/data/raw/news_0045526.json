That’s not encouraging men not to hit women. \n“I was not even allowed back in the house for six hours as forensics were in. \n“There was blood splattered everywhere.” The single mum was also left homeless after the incident \nLast month, before Dumbarton Sheriff Court, mechanical welder Connelly, 48, admitted assaulting Pauline. \nThe charge stated that on March 27 2016, at their home in Clydebank. near Glasgow, he repeatedly punched his partner on the head and threw her on to a bed all to her injury. \nBut when the dad-of-four returned to the dock last week for sentencing, he was hit with a paltry £300 fine. \nHorrified Pauline said: “When he pled guilty I thought, ‘That’s the end of it’. \n“I thought he would get community service.” Pauline pictured with her ex-David Connelly \nInstead, ​Connelly was fined and agreed to pay back the sum by next month. \nPauline added: “He was pleading financial difficulties but I can assure you his house is bought and paid for, he got a conservatory that was nearly £20,000 done and he has a caravan that is bought and paid for in Glencoe. \n\"£200 to him is nothing. \n“My mum and dad are disgusted and my sister said it is absolutely appalling. \n“There was a wee boy in court for a breach of the peace and he got 200 hours’ community service.” \nPauline started dating widower Connelly in April 2014 but says she ignored warnings from friends that he was “controlling”. Pauline was bruised all over \nThe following February, she gave up her flat and moved in with him. \nEight months later, in October 2015, Pauline claimed Connelly attacked her after a whisky binge but she never phoned the police. \nShe said: “I had to take a week off work and lie to my boss. My face was a mess.” \nThe following Easter, her parents, who are both in their 60s, came round for dinner on the Saturday night. \nThey left at around 12.30am and within an hour Pauline was on the phone to police. Pauline and David had a difficult relationship \nShe said: “David had been drinking whisky and just attacked me for no reason at all. \n“It started in the conservatory and continued in the kitchen. \n“I was covered in blood and I didn’t know where it was coming from. \n“I was petrified and I was in shock. \n“I felt sick and dizzy but I knew I had to get up the stairs as I couldn’t get a reception on my phone downstairs to call the police.” \nPauline was repeatedly punched on the head during the brutal assault. David said they had both been drunk at the time \nAs Pauline went upstairs to dial 999, Connelly followed and then sat on their bed with his arms and legs folded. \nShe was advised by the operator to stay on the line. Within minutes, two officers were at the door. \nAn ambulance was called and Pauline was taken to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow for a head scan. \nShe also required three ​s​titches to a cut above her left eyebrow. \nConnelly was arrested and kept in custody until he appeared in court the following Tuesday. \nPauline claimed ​his ​two teenage daughters were upstairs at the time of the assault but didn’t react to the commotion – even though a neighbour across the street heard her screams. \nDespite the charge stating she was pushed on to a bed, Pauline maintains the attack happened downstairs.

Neither had enough room for her to stay long-term. \nShe added: “I spent six months in a homeless unit. \n“The first house I was offered belonged to his step-daughter so I had to turn it down.” \nPauline only left the homeless unit in Duntocher last September. \nAnd the single mum has been so traumatised by the incident she only returned to work this month.

I have been fined. I now have a police record. \n“I never had any convictions for anything.” Like us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T14:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T09:22:00.339+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
