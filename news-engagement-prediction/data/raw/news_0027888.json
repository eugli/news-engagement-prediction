We hope to keep winning them and to have a cooler head when taking them.\" \nThe 2014 Spanish champions are fourth in the standings, seven points behind leaders Real Madrid who have played two games less. \nAtletico travel to Bayer Leverkusen for the first leg of their Champions League last 16 first-leg match on Feb. 21.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:07:04.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
