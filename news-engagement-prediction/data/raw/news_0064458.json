Credit: Nizar Dahan A Swansea charity worker who went on an aid mission to Iraq says he was left \"shocked and saddened\" when he was questioned by counter-terrorism officers on his return.\nNizar Dahan, who is an humanitarian aid worker from Sketty, has risked his life to help the thousands of Iraqi refugees left homeless by Isis. Last week he delivered aid to the camp on the outskirts of Mosul.\nIt's a very, very tough time for those people, but they have no other alternative. Most of them their houses have been destroyed they've had family murdered, kidnapped, raped, tortured in front of them. So, we focus a lot on providing food pack, water, blankets and mattresses for the people inside the camps.\n– Nizar Dahan But he says when he arrived home, officials wanted to ask him questions about extremism and radicalisation.\nIt was very frustrating to be honest. There are certain programs which are set up by the Government to monitor for extremism and radicalisation. Now, I am all for that because I am one of the main people who stands against it, especially when we were in Iraq, ISIS tried to kill us. So, I am very, very outspoken against extremists and radicals.\nTo get questioned by this organisation who look into radicalisation and stuff for something as petty as just saying the words 'war-torn countries' to me was very shocking and it saddened me really that all the work that I am doing and the Muslim community are doing and the local people of Swansea are doing to get picked up and questioned for something as petty as that.\n– Nizar Dahan Nizar Dahan directs the Swansea Humanitarian Aid Response Project which sends hundreds of tonnes of clothes and food to refugees in Europe and the Middle East. Credit: Nizar Dahan As part of his work for the charity the Human Relief Foundation he had to deliver fresh water to those trapped while the fight for Mosul rages on. As they neared the war zone Nizar and his fellow aid workers were targeted by an Isis drone.\nWe were within 3km of their stronghold and we were stopped at a military checkpoint by the Iraqi security special forces. When we were talking to them a guy came riding on his bike and started shouting: 'Drones! Drones!' Everyone panicked and we had to get out of the car. We were standing there then 10 seconds later we heard a really loud explosion quite close to us. It's very scary and for me, it put it into perspective what these people must be living through every day.\n– Nizar Dahan The Home Office says it does not comment on individual cases and South Wales Police says Prevent Officers often engage with members of the public returning from conflict zones.\nWhen not in Iraq, Nizar directs the Swansea Humanitarian Aid Response Project which sends hundreds of tonnes of clothes and food to refugees in Europe and the Middle East.\nNizar's work has led to him being nominated for the international award at this year's St David Awards.\nWatch our Swansea Correspondent Dean Thomas-Welch 's report:\nPlay video Last updated Wed 22 Feb 2017 World Swansea South Wales", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/itvdean"], "published": "2017-02-23T02:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T08:54:37.129+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
