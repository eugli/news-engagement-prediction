Stephen Brashear/Getty Images \nEveryone has a way of dealing with the world around them. \nSome limit the stimulus to their eyes and ears and eat large packets of potato chips. Others choose to strengthen their minds and bodies, ready to battle whatever might come their way. \nThe latter explanation was allegedly given to police by a man who was stopped on the Microsoft campus at 3:30 a.m. on January 27. \nA Redmond Public Safety Facebook post reveals the full glory of this man's attempts to steel himself. \nIt said a female police officer saw a male out for a run. \"After seeing nude buttocks illuminated by a street light, she and another officer contacted the jogger, who was wearing nothing but black Sketcher sneakers,\" the police added. \nIlluminated nude buttocks are the sort of thing that few enjoy seeing at random. How, though, might the nude jogger have explained himself? \n\"When questioned, he stated 'he was trying to build up his immune system to fight the cold weather'.\" \nWasn't that entirely obvious? Sadly, the police added: \"We do not have pictures to share of this incident. You are welcome.\" \nThey don't have pictures? Don't they know how Facebook works? \nThe police told me that they wouldn't be releasing his name. \"Officers immediately checked with nearby police departments to determine if any related sightings or issues had been reported and none had,\" a police spokesman told me. \"So he was not arrested or charged, as there were no victims and there was no other reason to legally detain him.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T10:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T05:22:11.869+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
