Source: \nThe Wanderers are again under fire over supporters' behaviour after Saturday's derby against Sydney FC, with Football Federation Australia condemning a homophobic banner brandished by their fans. FFA condemn homophobic WSW fan banner A-League chief Greg O'Rourke has been swift in voicing his disgust at a discriminatory banner in Western Sydney's support area during the Sydney derby. \nThe banner, depicting oral sex and publicly saluted by the Wanderers' active supporter group the Red and Black Bloc, was unfurled in front of almost 45,000 fans. \nMore than a dozen arrests of attendees were also recorded at ANZ Stadium, with charges by NSW police including assault, throwing a missile and drug possession after an officer's eye was cut by a projectile thrown during a fight. \nVeteran Santalab, who scored the winner in the 1-0 result against the ladder-leading Sky Blues, said poor crowd behaviour threatened to take some of the gloss off the game where they ended a three-year derby drought. \n\"We don't want to see that in our game,\" Santalab told Sky Sports Radio on Monday. \n\"It was a great night of football and a great spectacle. Popovic chat behind Santalab derby winner Brendon Santalab has credited a frank mid-week discussion with coach Tony Popovic for his composed goal in Saturday's 1-0 derby defeat of Sydney FC. \n\"For the fans who are interested in causing trouble, it's not what we want in the A-League and definitely at the Wanderers. \n\"We'd like to stamp that out and just have a nice family evening and a great spectacle for the game.\" Wanderers' derby win revives A-League season ANALYSIS: It just had to be the Wanderers who inflicted the first defeat of the season on runaway A-League leaders and bitter rivals Sydney FC. \nThe Wanderers said the club remains committed to providing a family-friendly environment at games. \nA suspended points deduction, in place until the end of this season, as punishment for fan trouble associated with lighting flares hangs over the sixth-placed side.
