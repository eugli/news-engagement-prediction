(Photo: Bud Berry/The Star) Buy Photo \nBelieving he'd been cheated in a business deal, former Pontiac salesman Anthony G. Kiritsis entered his banker's office 40 years ago this month with a loaded shotgun. \nBut he didn't shoot. \nHe had something else in mind on Feb. 8, 1977, a plan so well-calculated that for the next 63 hours the Indianapolis Police Department and Indiana State Police couldn't stop it and so weird and potentially violent that the people of Indianapolis couldn't turn away from it. \nHow often, after all, does a man — wild-eyed, ranting and raving — hold a shotgun to another man's head and march him through Downtown Indianapolis at 9 a.m. on a Tuesday — and later, his gun still fixed on his hostage, hold a \"news conference\" that, at his insistence, is broadcast on live TV? \n\"Ladies and gentlemen, when I picked up this shotgun Tuesday morning, all the hell I've been through … ,\" Kiritsis told a gathering of reporters, photographers and police officers, the cameras rolling. He went on for nearly half an hour, his mood shifting between calm and crazed. \"I was in trouble, friends. When you … kidnap somebody, I tell you, it's … a narrow, one-way road.\" \nTony Kiritsis talks to the media just priot to releasing his hostage Richard Hall. Feb. 10, 1977 after a three-day standoff with police. (Photo: Star file photo) \nNow he was in tears. More than one person was certain Kiritsis was leading up to a messy, public execution. \nThe hostage was Richard O. Hall. Hall looked straight ahead. He had a wife and four children. He was 42. The Halls were occasionally in the newspaper society pages for hosting parties. He was an executive at the lending institution Meridian Mortgage, where his father was president. \nAs Kiritsis rambled and shrieked profanely, his finger always on the trigger of the shotgun, the gun barrel wired cleverly around Hall's neck, Hall appeared \"like he was either courageous, angry, fearful, humiliated or willing to accept whatever was going to happen,\" said Skip Hess, a reporter for The Indianapolis News. \n\"It looked like he was tired of everything. But he kind of had his head up. He sort of, you know, seemed defiant. … I just wondered: 'What was going through his mind?' \" CLOSE x Share \"I looked in Kiritsis' eye early on and thought to myself, 'How can God allow someone to get so angry?'\" Provided by Richard O. Hall \nHall, who was released moments later, has never said what was going through his mind. He described his captivity briefly during Kiritsis' subsequent trial. A month later he spoke at a news conference. But he has never spoken personally at length. \nNow, at 82, Hall breaks his silence. He is writing a book, \"Kiritsis and Me: Enduring 63 Hours at Gunpoint.\" A friend of Hall's who's helping with the book, Scott Watson, said it will be out in April. Through Watson, Hall declined to be interviewed until the book is released. But he sent three videotaped statements. CLOSE x Share Nearly 40 years after being Tony Kiritsis's hostage for 63 hours, Dick Hall discusses how the story of his ordeal has lived longer than he ever thought it would. Provided by Richard O. Hall \nAnswering the question, 'Why talk now, after 40 years?': Hall mentioned he was getting up in years and if he was going to tell his story he'd better do it now. Also, he said, \"One of my sons said, 'Dad, I don't want my kids to think of you as a wimp or (that) I can't tell the story.\" \nOf his initial encounter with Kiritsis the morning of Feb. 8, 1977: \"I looked in Kiritsis' eye early on and thought to myself, 'How can God allow someone to get so angry?' He had a wild look in his eye. ... It was astonishing to me.\" \nUpon being taken to Kiritsis' apartment: ​\"He said, 'Dick, we're going to have a little trial here, and I'm going to be the judge, jury and executioner.'\" \nAt trial, Kiritsis was found not guilty by reason of insanity, but he did not go free. For the next decade, Kirtisis remained in custody at several mental institutions. He was released in 1988. He lived the next 17 years in an apartment on Indianapolis' westside. Kiritsis died in 2005 at age 72. \nContact IndyStar reporter Will Higgins at (317) 444-6043. Follow him on Twitter @WillRHiggins . A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. Buy Photo Richard O.
