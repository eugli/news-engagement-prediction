Story continues below \n“When they get him out of the car, they go to pat him down for weapons, they can see he’s got tattoos all over his face and all over his neck,” county sheriff’s Lt. John Corina said. \nThe man then pulled a semi-automatic handgun from his waistband and opened fire at the officers, who were wearing bulletproof vests and shot back, Corina said. \n“They walked up on the vehicle believing the motorist was in need of medical help and then they ended up in a gunfight for their lives,” Sheriff Jim McDonnell said. \nREAD MORE: Fugitive wanted in Orlando officer’s fatal shooting captured \nWhittier Police Chief Jeff Piper wept as he described Boyer as a friend of more than 25 years. \n“All of us have been grieving,” the chief said. “And I didn’t think I had any tears left.” \nGov. Jerry Brown issued a statement of condolence. Capitol flags were ordered to be flown at half-staff in his honour. \nThe suspect, a 26-year-old gang member, had a history of serious crimes and had been granted early release from Los Angeles County jail about a week ago, Corina said. He didn’t know the nature of his offence. \nHis name wasn’t immediately released. \nEarlier Monday, he shot and killed his cousin in East Los Angeles and took his car, which later rear-ended another car in the neighbouring city of Whittier, Corina said. \nHe got out and asked those he had hit to help push his stolen car from the intersection. \nBoyer and Hazel didn’t know any of those details when they answered the report of a car accident, Corina said. \nREAD MORE: Arizona cop ambushed, shot and beaten is rescued by passersby \nBoyer was pronounced dead at a hospital. Hazel, a three-year veteran, and the suspect were hospitalized in stable condition and were expected to live. \nAfter the shooting, a long line of police cars escorted the slain officer’s body from a hospital in Irvine to the coroner’s office. Mourners placed candles and flowers outside police headquarters. \nBoyer joined the force as a dispatcher in 1989 and became a full-time officer in 1990. A divorced father who played the drums, he was “the best of the best” who was sought for advice by his colleagues and superiors, the chief said. \nBoyer recently talked to the chief about retiring. \nThe Whittier Police Department has about 125 sworn officers who patrol Whittier and Santa Fe Springs. \nThe department has had two other officers killed in the line of duty – a detective in 1979 and a corporal in 1977. © 2017 The Canadian Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T10:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T05:49:33.893+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
