Council member Datuk Dr Yusof Yakob, who chaired the meeting, said Annuar’s temporary removal will remain in effect pending findings of the probe. \nAnnuar is expected to return home from New Zealand today.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:11:07.964+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
