Shocked passenger Lee Dalgleish was on his way to work when he spotted the amorous couple getting it on - despite the train being packed with workers. The graphic designer, 32, was travelling from Gillingham, Kent, to London Victoria at 8:45am when the woman mounted her boyfriend. Thankfully, she wrapped her coat around herself, sparing horrified commuters sight of any action. Lee said: 'I was on my way to work, and I saw this couple taking up six seats. 'The way they were seated they were taking up a lot of space, so I asked him to move his feet and they just looked at me and ignored me. 'I found it really odd that she was straddling him, I don't imagine they were actually having sex but there's a time and place for that. 'I thought it was really bizarre for that time of the morning, it's not appropriate and I found it so surprising, it was quite amusing. 'I know people's perceptions of public displays of affection vary but what's going on here? 'You don't know what could be going on underneath her coat. 'It could have been completely innocent but I was the only one who said anything.
