Click to followES Going Out Can't Fight The Moonlight: staff at Dirty Harry’s \nIt was the all-singing, all-dancing film about a raucous bar that became a Hollywood hit — and Coyote Ugly is still inspiring new venues 17 years later. \nDirty Harry’s, an American-style cocktail lounge and diner, will open in Wardour Street in Soho on Saturday. From 9pm, bartenders will get on the bar and crank up the music before dancing — sometimes spraying guests with beer for good measure. \nIn the hit romcom starring Tyra Banks , Adam Garcia and Piper Perabo, the latter plays a struggling songwriter who takes a job at a bar, Coyote Ugly, in New York, where servers dance and sing. The film, which also stars LeAnn Rimes and features her single Can’t Fight The Moonlight, was inspired by a real bar of the same name which opened in Manhattan in 1993. A chain of Coyote Ugly bars was later established across America and Europe, with the first UK venue set up in Cardiff last year. \nThe arrival of Dirty Harry’s follows a series of high-profile closures in Soho. In 2014, after cabaret club Madame JoJo’s shut, celebrities including Stephen Fry and Tim Arnold launched the Save Soho campaign. Inspiration: LeAnn Rimes and Piper Perabo in Coyote Ugly (Reuters) \nThe bar will have live bands and dance shows throughout the night and host a team of street food chefs operating on a pop-up basis. From February to April, Cajun chicken specialists Otherside Fried and Burger and Beyond, a gourmet burger outfit, will be providing the food. The team behind the bar described it as a “rock ‘n’ roll blue collar bar”. The best bars in London The best bars in London 1/50 Oskar's Bar at Dabbous \n39 Whitfield St, WIT 2SF, dabbous.co.uk The website is pitch black, the bar itself is underlit, but the drinks are a radiant, white ray of beaming perfect light: heavenly. That’s a terrible pun, but they’re big on terrible puns, with drinks including Rye rye rye Delilah, Tequila Mockingbird and Whiskey business. It’s a touch masculine – lots of dark leather – but you’ll get over that after the first serve, and hey, calling it industrial chic softens the blow. Given plenty of second-rate bars push £12 for gin with dead flowers, drinks here at around a tenner offer terrific value. Oskar Kinberg has built a menu doing different things: ingredients include gin washed with extra virgin olive oil, wild nettles, red wine reductions and shiso. But the results work: these aren’t odd blends for the sake of it, they’re balanced, nuanced, thought through. They’ve some seriously top shelf spirits, too. 2/50 Scarfes Bar at Rosewood London \n252 High Holborn, WC1V 7EN, rosewoodhotels.com/london The Rosewood is doubly wonderful for drinkers, as they’ve two fine spots. In the modern Dining Room, sit at the gin bar, which outstocks anywhere else in London, with more than 400 gins and 27 tonics. Trying to choose is impossible, but what a lovely impossibility to have. The bar staff clearly had one hell of a tasting session as they know the list perfectly. Across the way is Scarfes Bar, a brilliant, brilliant bar gladly shaken free from all the stuffiness usually found in hotel bars. The drinks are stunning, they’ve often live music, it gets wonderfully busy and crackles with laughter, and the manager, Giovanni Spezziga, is a man who will treat you better than your own family does. Go a little later and it’s busier, people drink more, everything is better. 3/50 White Lyan \n153-155 Hoxton St, N1 6PJ, whitelyan.com White Lyan looked at other bars, shrugged its shoulders and said: “to hell with it”. No ice, no fruit and, er, no spirits – at least, not that you’ll spot on the shelves. Oh, they don’t really do shelves, either. Everything here lives in a fridge, and is premixed, but not like in that terrible bar you’ve been trying to forget since uni. It’s done deftly, with a touch of science, as cool and clear as its black and white New-York-in-the-80s decor. There’s no chance for going off menu, but little need to: drinks are largely marvellous, bolstered by Mr Lyan’s own refined and remixed spirits. Their take on classic cocktails are excellent, but be brave and work from the Heaps Mad Shit menu. Odder; better. They've also their own wines, a cider, and a very decent lager. If you’re nearer Blackfriars, head to its sister bar, Dandelyan. 4/50 Andrew Edmunds \n46 Lexington St, W1F 0LP, andrewedmunds.com Perhaps better than it’s ever been, Andrew Edmunds recently won The Good Drinking prize in our Restaurant Awards, and for good reason. It’s a small spot, cramped to the point that coming here on a first date feels like you’re being very forward indeed , with the best tables upstairs and not much to look at – just settle for being distracted by someone beautiful. The food, French-ish/English-ish, is fine, but its the wine that's extraordinary. And you’re here for wine: forget cocktails, they have. What a list, and so quietly marked up that you’re getting a steal with almost every bottle – indeed, the more expensive the better the deal. Having been going 30 years, those who knew old Soho say it’s one of the last bastion of such things. Drink too much gorgeous wine and come back often. 5/50 The Connaught Bar \nConnaught, Carlos Place, W1K 2AL, the-connaught.co.uk A bar for the impossibly beautiful, a bar of high heels and glimmering lights, of perfume and leather. Aside from oddly thumping music, the Connaught is wonderfully detached from the world – a place of its own, cosy and winter warm when it needs to be, light and summer when desired. The drinks, naturally pricey, are well put together and while classic in tone, come with crackles of theatre: washes in perfume bottles, branches as garnishes, smoke, the lot. Still, the martini trolley is what they’re famed for, so it’s only right to indulge. Afterward, head to the Champagne Room: sadly the law stops it being the cigar haven it once was, but it's still gorgeous: romantic and charming with its fireplace, dramatic with its glass ceiling and sculpture swan diving. Treat yourself to the Ruinart blanc de blanc. Damned good olives, too. 6/50 Bar Américain \n20 Sherwood St, W1F 7ED, brasseriezedel.com As the name suggests, this is a classic American bar, and done near perfectly. One can become very fond of Bar Américain and very quickly: passing through Piccadilly Circus, it acts as a magnet – a quick negroni becomes a temptation impossible to resist. It’s a very beautiful place, calling to mind grand Parisian hotels of the 20s and 30s, bottles winking from the bar, staff floating through with their finery and litres of charm. You’re here to drink the classics: they’ve a killer Clover Club and a straight-down-the-line Manhattan. But ask: the bartenders know their stuff and bring their A-game to any challenge – tell them what you like, and they’ll bring you something new. They often have specials on, as well. Top marks for the attentive staff, bringing plenty of water and bowl after bowl of popcorn – both essential after a few here. 7/50 Milk & Honey \n61 Poland St, W1F 7NU, mlkhny.com You know a bar is good when local bartenders love it, and Milk & Honey has long been a Soho favourite for those in the know. Hidden in plain sight this terrific bar has been doing its thing for just shy of 15 years. The talent hasn’t diminished, and neither has the care put into the drinks. Cocktails are strong and proper and happily, they're updating the list soon to freshen things up. At around £10 a drink, M&H is also a bargain for central London, and the quality outstrips the price. It functions as a members bar, but non-members can book up until 11pm – though going earlier in the week means you’re more likely to score a table. Milk & Honey is civilised, without the crushing formality. Next door is the Blind Pig, another top 'hidden' spot. 8/50 Oriole \nSmithfield Markets, E Poultry Ave, EC1A 9LH, oriolebar.com The team behind Nightjar took their winning formula, gave it a bit of a shake up and created Oriole. They’ve live music throughout the week – from Wednesday to Saturday, there’s a charge per person, so watch out for that – which gives any night here a bit of zip. This is a strictly seated spot, so be sure to book: once inside, it’s a whirlwind tour of the world, with fine details from across the globe, both in the styling and the drinks… and so much cheaper than booking a holiday. Drinks are excellent, whether you’re into New Orleans style classics or something from the depths of Asia: explore the menu (split into Old World, New World and The Orient) and expect something unusual and faintly brilliant, with a touch of the Tiki. Put it this way: Oriole is ideal whether you prefer drinking from a crystal tumbler, a teacup or, er, a silver crocodile. 9/50 Mark's Bar \nHIX Soho, 66- 70 Brewer St, W1F 9UP, hixrestaurants.co.uk The bad: you might not get in. If it’s busy, they don’t squeeze people into this basement, so either be there early, or bamboozle them with charm, or dazzle them with your brilliant wit. We’re kidding: just take someone hot. The good: pretty much everything else. Naturally, the bar snacks are distractingly tasty, but the drinks list is excellent, and unusual too, with a few historical recipes brought back to life. Attention to detail is everything here, so if you’re not sharing one of the big old Chesterfields, head to the bar and sit and watch – there’s something about it that’s like seeing a cardmaster turn tricks. And have a Hix Fix, just to say you have. 10/50 Piano Works \n113-117 Farringdon Road, Farringdon EC1R 3BX, pianoworks.bar Full credit to this fun Farringdon spot: they’ve worked hard to make the place better and better since opening, which is pretty good going for what was already a decent spot to begin with. The Piano Works sounds like a quiet jazz bar but instead is a hell-raising house of sound, splendidly raucous, where a house band take requests and belt out your favourite songs. The more you get involved, the more fun it is, and the place heats up the later it gets. Wine starts at £16, house cocktails are £8, but they've tons of terrific deals during the week – including cocktails for a fiver (!!) Drink lots, dance lots and leave in the early hours with someone you shouldn’t do. That’s what we did. 11/50 Artesian \n1C Portland Pl, W1B 1JA, artesian-bar.co.uk Artesian won its accolades for its team, Alex Kratena and Simone Caporale, who ran the place for eight years and earned its reputation as the best bar in the world. They’ve sadly departed, but have left the place in capable hands, and the feel is much the same as it ever was, which is chic, glamorous, and not taking itself too seriously. While the beautiful and the rich rub shoulders, the bartenders are mixing up excellent but often slightly silly drinks – but it’s their mischievousness that makes them so winning. Seriously impressive. 12/50 Les Compagnie Des Vins Surnaturels \n8-10 Neal's Yard, WC2H 9DP, cvssevendials.com Call it CVS and your night becomes considerably easier to pronounce. Sat in Neil’s Yard, it is one of London’s finest wine bars. Thoroughly French, of course: New World wines barely get a sideways glance, while even Italy’s finest is only begrudgingly given a little space on the considerable menu. This doesn't mean there is a lack of choice – to the contrary, it is almost overwhelming, though they have a short by-the-glass list, and the charming staff are both well informed and passionate about what to have. In the summer, sit outdoors, in the winter, cosy up by the bar. Wherever you are, try the mystery wine; if you guess it, you’ll win a bottle. Have food – small plates made to share, and terrifically good – and drink plenty, so the bill doesn’t hit as hard. 13/50 The Shrub & Shutter \n336 Coldharbour Ln, SW9 8QH, theshrubandshutter.com This Brixton bar felt new in the area, taking a little of east London and bringing it down south. They’ve a pleasingly patchwork approach to decor: there are jars and bottles and shakers everywhere, which gives the place a kitchen feel. The cocktails, lovely to drink on their own, are made better with the food, which is designed to match what you’re drinking. The pairings initially sound a little gimmicky – crayfish with vodka, venison on the side of ‘The Deerhunter’ (an old fashioned, basically) – but they work, so drop that sceptical streak for a moment. It gets busy, so book up, get in early, and stay late. They’ve a license until 3am, so it’d be rude not to. 14/50 Sky Pod at the Sky Garden \n1 Sky Garden Walk, EC3M 8AF, skygarden.london The truth of it is, you come for the view, but good God it's a great view, and 360-degrees at that. Up 35 floors, if you can think of a London icon, you can probably see it. When the weather's good, get outside for some fresh air. With completely free entry and minimal security fuss, it’s worth making a reservation, though if you’re ok to queue, they’ll have you in. Cocktails aren’t torturously expensive, at around £11.50, and are very enjoyable – the cognac-chocolate-caramel-port mix that is Black and Gold is particularly good– so it doesn't feel like they're relying on the sights. There’s a sense of special occasion, and all the more so with live music on Thursday, Friday and Saturdays. They’re hoping for jazz on Wednesdays, too. If you’re tempted to eat, Fenchurch and the Darwin Brasserie are well worth trying – Fenchurch is particularly good for veggies. 15/50 Hawksmoor, Spitalfields \n157A Commercial St, E1 6BJ, thehawksmoor.com It’s hardly surprising the bar snacks are a highlight here – have the oxcheek nuggets with a side of chips, then call the waiter over to order them over again – given how good the steak upstairs is. The drinks and setting, though, match them pound for pound. The old tube tiles on the walls, the beautiful parquet floor, the copper tops and silvery black ceiling make the large space a place to settle in for the night no matter your seat, while the cocktails come with oodles of thought in each one: the new menu has homemade bitters, shrubs and syrups, and it’s bloody obvious everyone behind the bar is more than a little nerdy about building drinks. Shaky Pete’s Ginger Brew is the classic, so have it, but follow up with the Shadow Boxer, a mix of scotch, sherry and Fernet-Branca. Odd, oddly delicious. It’s also a cracking place to sit for a bottle of wine. 16/50 The Gilbert Scott \nSt Pancras Renaissance Hotel, Euston Rd, NW1 2AR, thegilbertscott.co.uk Given the golden hue here, where luxury hangs in the air like perfume, it’s remarkable that wine starts at as little as £5 a glass. Wine is its strong point, and likeable head sommelier Joris Beijn is a man worth knowing: he is passionate about his list, knowledgeable and accommodating. The bar is flexible, in that it is by turns ideal for a date, or a catch up with old friends, or a pre/post dinner drinks. The room is a stunner: high painted ceilings, dramatic red walls, great big bells as art, marble bar top and crystal glasses catching the light. Cocktails come in at around £14, and err on the light side: lots of gin and floral concoctions. The restaurant, next door, isn’t to be missed, either, just be prepared to get an Uber home: invariably, you’ll stretch and tease out the evening to stay just a little longer. 17/50 Gerry's Club \n52 Dean Street, W1D 5BJ, gerrysclub.com A word of warning: this is technically a member's club, but you'll probably be fine if you flirt enough – and don't ask for Gerry, he's long since passed. Michael looks after this place now. We've only been once – very late, very drunk and with very good friends. Most old-school Soho drinking dens are dead, but this hub of actors and writers is what remains of 'Old Soho'. If you're boring, steer clear: it is a place to drink wine and beer and tell stories, to laugh uproariously and to give yourself a monumental hangover in a faintly discreet way. 18/50 68 and Boston \n4-5 Greek St, Soho, W1D 4DD, 68andboston.com Boston, the bar upstairs, looks like glamorous train carriage from the golden age of cocktails but plays it a little bit safe. Wine bar 68, downstairs, is the real gem, with a wonderful way of pricing: every bottle on the list is £20, so choose what you like, not what you can afford. Better yet, if you don't fancy a bottle, they're served by the carafe (£14) or glass (£5.50). Wines are well picked and Denise Medrano, wine blogger and lover found behind the bar, is always working to update the list – so go back to try something new. You’ll probably end up getting drunk here: the pull of another bottle at just £20 is monumentally hard to resist, but hey, that’s what Soho is for. If you fancy drinking something more upscale, ask – they’ve a few ‘hidden’ wines kept hidden away for those in the know. That’s you, now. 19/50 The Pink Chihuahua at El Camion \n25-27 Brewer St, W1F 0RR, elcamion.co.uk Forget house infusions and drinks that take half an hour to make: sometimes a good night needs tequila and dancing. The Pink Chihuahua is built for it: they’re providing the tequila – more than 300 different types of it, in fact – you’re there to drink it down and dance it up. They’ve all sorts of twists on Margaritas and Daiquiris, and, given you’re downstairs from Mexican restaurant El Camion, plenty of bar food to indulge in too. Lots of fun, and if you’re feeling more in the mood just to sit back and sip something slowly, ask about their choice of Mezcal. There's real talent here, but fun too. 20/50 The Gibson \n44 Old St, EC1V 9AQ, thegibsonbar.london Given the dearth of decent cocktails in Farringdon, the tiny Gibson is a God-send. It’s a parlour pitched somewhere between Edwardian and Art Deco, and drinks aren’t simply poured here, they’re tended to, built, thought about, adored. All unsurprising, really, given the team learnt their trade at the likes of Nightjar and The Connaught. This place is doing more creatively to push bartending forward than any bar that's opened up in a while, so ask the team for recommendations and you’ll be presented with something magic. You’ll need to ask, actually, as the menu is a novel and there’s the risk of wasting the evening reading instead of drinking, and that simply wouldn’t do at all. 21/50 Peg+Patriot \nPatriot Square, E2 9NF, talentedmrfox.com The Talented Mr Fox, Matt Whiley, offers is a nice blend of things here: while the menu takes a sophisticated trip around London, with each cocktail a column of flavour, some managing chameleonic taste all within the space of a sip, the actual bar is surprisingly spare and understated. The effect is such that while drinks are upmarket, one doesn’t feel obliged to sit demurely to enjoy them. Relax, have a few – you might want to, as the serves aren’t huge. It should be said that these cocktails are among London’s most interesting, rather than London’s best: they are talking points, oddities, they put flavours together in a way that isn’t available elsewhere. If you’re big on trying new things, different experiences, seeing what a cocktail can do, come, it’s a must. If it’s just something reliably delicious you fancy, elsewhere may be better. 22/50 Worship Street Whistling Shop \n63 Worship St, EC2A 2DU, whistlingshop.com One presumes the staff here have night vision, otherwise it’s a complete and utter mystery how they see customers, let alone their ingredients. Still, they must do, for the output is pretty much excellent through and through at this dark spot. It’s Victorian-inspired, which sounds tired and not a little tacky, but the gang from Purl have done it properly. Drinks are busy – lots of fusions, blends, gasses and pressure and all sorts – so it’s appropriate they come out of a lab. Still, all this engineering seems to be worth it, as the drinks slip down easily, the alcohol often hidden away. Make sure to take a seat in the Dram Shop, and pop in to the Gin Closet too, which operates as an honesty bar. 23/50 Kansas Smitty's \n63-65 Broadway Market, E8 4PH, kansassmittys.com Below bar ‘Off Broadway’ – a long way off, it’s Mexican – sits this glorious den of jazz and juleps. It is a speakeasy for 2016: that is to say, it has none of the contrived mannerisms of bars which proclaim to be speakeasies, it just happens to actually be one: you’ll need to knock to get in, the music raves loud and hot, and the place is so crowded strangers become family after a drink or two. The house band, for which the place is named, have envy-inducing talent, and the bar has fairly recently overhauled its drinks list, and the results are good. You’ll be absorbed by the music, and stay afterwards to ride the buzz of the crowd. 24/50 GŎNG \n52, Shangri-La Hotel, the Shard, SE1 9QU, .gong-shangri-la.com Gong is in the Shard, so you’re there for the view alone. View it certainly does: at 52 floors up, it’s by far London’s highest spot to drink: consequently, sipping on a martini, one feels a little like a Bond villain pondering all that’s below. It’s not a huge bar, but that somewhat adds to the sense of exclusivity. Prices are, naturally, sky high: expect to pay at least £18. The drinks have plenty about them to compete with the view: presentation is everything. They’ve not skipped on the spirits making the mix, either: expect the likes of Zacapa 23 rum (heavenly stuff), Talisker scotch and Tanqueray 10 for the gin. All top drawer stuff. If this all sounds a bit intimidating, bear in mind they operate a no reservations policy, so you’ve as good a chance of getting in as anyone else. 25/50 Mr Fogg's Salon \n58 St Martin's Lane, Theatreland, WC2N 4EA, mr-foggs.com Downstairs is a pretty decent pub, busy from theatreland. Upstairs, the salon is quieter, but only a little. The walls are a glittering ballgown of 19th century curiosities, unsubtle nonsense winking away. Head to a chaise longues with a couple of friends or a date and take in something from each one of the five “acts” which split the menu. Drinks seem to smell especially good here, rich, relying heavily on the likes of rum, cognac and sherry. Gin lovers need not despair: they’ve a room with 300 different types next door. Come elegantly dressed. 26/50 The Beaufort bar and the American Bar at The Savoy \nThe Savoy, Strand, WC2R 0EU, fairmont.com Glitz, glamour and lots of gold: both Savoy bars are wonderfully opulent. The world-famous American bar, recently revamped, is still up there as one of the best bars on our humble planet. The bartenders bible, Harry Craddock’s The Savoy Cocktail Book, was written here, and the cocktails served today remain as finely tuned as they ever were. Whereas as other bars try to recreate the glamour of such places, The Savoy needn’t pretend: everything is genuine. The palatial Beaufort is absurdly romantic, and drinks are extravagantly presented: it works for the most special of special occasions, and there’s something undeniably grand about sipping away in the same place Frank Sinatra, Marlene Dietrich, Coco Chanel and Ernest Hemingway all did. If you’re planning a few drinks, either be rich or take someone rich – seriously. 27/50 Bar Termini \n7 Old Compton St, W1D 5JE, bar-termini.com Do Bar Termini right and you’ll love it: do it wrong, and you may be underwhelmed. Tony Conigliaro, cocktail chap par excellence, and coffee maestro Marco Arrigo have built a revolving-door of a place: don’t come here to linger. Expect a night of cocktails and you’ll leave disappointed: instead, love it in the day for the £1 espressos, and swing by in the evening for a negroni (£6). They’re small, but some of the best in the capital. One swishes in and out here, and that way, it adds a touch of Italian glamour to any evening. 28/50 Trisha's (New Evaristo Club) \n57 Greek St, Soho, W1D 3DXDrinks don’t make a bar, and thank goodness, as the stuff served at Trisha’s – named for its owner – is uniformly pretty awful: red and white wine you’d consider an insult if a friend served it at supper, prosecco wildly overpriced, terrible spirits ecetera ecetera. At more than 70, the club is Soho’s oldest, and while nobody who goes there can ever remember anything changing – it’s often quite hard to recall much about Trisha’s in crystal detail, as it happens – nothing needs to. The bad wine and expensive mixers and paint stripper spirits are all part of the point: it’s a glorious drinking den, and marvellous, marvellous fun. There are characters here: the last time we were in, we sat being scared witless by an old East End gangster who said he’s known the Krays. Tremendous. Long may this place live. 29/50 The Fumoir \nClaridge's, 49 Brook St, W1K 4HR, claridges.co.uk The Fumoir will confuse you, as you’ll be torn between shouting about it and keeping it all to yourself. This plush purple and leather spot, deco decadence with a touch of welcome pomp, is hidden away behind a secret door at Claridge’s. Tiny and glitzy enough to feel like a Hollywood dressing room from the Golden Age, it’s little surprise the likes of Christina Hendricks adore it. For such a small place, they squeeze an awful lot in: plenty of wines, classic cocktails given a stern shake up, buckets of gin, a lovely choice of armagnac and a magnificent scotch list, gleaming with rarities. 30/50 69 Colebrooke Row \n69 Colebrooke Row, N1 8AA, 69colebrookerow.com Once known as ‘the bar with no name’, henceforth they shall be called ‘the bar with Bernard’s watch’, as there is no other explanation for the speed with which their finely mixed cocktails arrive. Another bar from Tony Conigliaro, it’s earned its reputation for turning out hit after hit: the drinks list is endlessly tempting. The piano is a nice touch; that is gets played a much nicer one, and make sure to order the Prairie Oyster – fun to drink, and one even for those who can’t eat seafood. Bear in mind it’s a small spot, so you’re close to your neighbours, and if you don’t like strong drinks where the booze kicks, this won’t be for you. 31/50 Happiness Forgets \n8-9 Hoxton Square, N1 6NU, happinessforgets.com Don’t expect frills and fuss or the rest of it here: Happiness Forgets is cocktail bar distilled down to its very essence, and done very well – their tag “High End Cocktails/Low End Rent” sums it up best. The bartenders are all top drawer, and their creations impeccable. Unsurprisingly, this Hoxton space has its regulars, so the crowd is always good. Tables can be booked, but half are always kept for walk-ins: try your luck, it’s worth it. 32/50 Dry Martini by Javier de las Muelas \nMeliá White House Hotel, Albany Street, NW1 3UP, melia.com Come to this one to brag: Dry Martini is known as Barcelona’s best cocktail bar, and has been rated the fifth best bar in the world by the World’s 50 Best Bars panel. Renowned bartender Javier de las Muelas has bought over his concept to us lucky Londoners, and with it, finely mixed and classic cocktails. No prizes for guessing that the Dry Martini is the house special – if you don’t think you like them, here’s a place to change your mind – but bar manager Martin Siska, who used to run the Barcelona site and the bar in Brown’s Hotel, has plenty else on the list worth trying. With more than 80 gins on the list, you could easily lose a week here. 33/50 Gordon's \n47 Villiers St, WC2N 6NE, gordonswinebar.com Gordon’s seems to get more and more crowded with each passing day, but perhaps rightly so: the beloved Embankment institution is made for knocking back bottles of wine in. Eat a few cold bites and chat into a long, unwinding evening. The wine list is good enough, but you’re really here for the atmosphere: in summer, the terrace, buzzing, in winter, the caves indoors, crammed with noise, spilt wine, and joy. 34/50 Social bar at City Social \n25 Old Broad St, EC2N 1HQ, citysociallondon.com You’d think you’re at City Social, up 24 stories of Tower 42, to eat, but if you stop in the bar, there’s a good chance you won’t make it to your table. The drinks come as something of a surprise: they’re so much better than one expects from a restaurant bar, inventive, put together carefully but not staidly, retaining a sense of fun. And, crucially, damned tasty. It’s a dark room, and full of city types, but perfect for a few late night cocktails soaking up the view, which is really quite wonderful. Bloody pricey, but that’s part of it. 35/50 Ladies and Gentlemen \n2 Highgate Rd, NW5 1NR, twitter.com William Borrell’s bolthole transcends its gimmick (which, if you hadn’t guessed, is that it’s a converted public loo), with the help of some very handy bartenders, and its house-brewed gin, Highwayman, of which twelve bottles a day get distilled. Ladies & Gents manages well as a place for a quiet drink, or better yet, a place to quietly get roaringly drunk. Convenient indeed. The drinks are strong, very interesting, and there’s plenty of odd sods on the wall to keep your conversation up. It maintains a veneer of being somewhere faintly upmarket, but you’ll probably end up reading from one of the books scattered around or trying to dance to the live music. Perfect for a date that gets out of hand. 36/50 Bull In A China Shop \n196 Shoreditch High Street, E1 6LG, bullinachinashop.london Truth it, you’ll need to catch this place on a good night, as we’ve been in often enough to know it has its good nights and its ‘meh’ nights. But when the place is on, it’s really cooking, and easily one of the best bars in town. The cocktail list is short, but thought through, and care is taken in even the small things: they even make sure the water glasses are chilled. The chamomile and charcoal Old-Fashioned is a must, and any whisky lovers should get chatting to the bar staff, as they’ve bottles which aren’t available anywhere else in the capital. 37/50 Sager + Wilde \nArch, 250 Paradise Row, E2 9LE, sagerandwilde.com Wine lovers rejoice, wine bores look elsewhere. Sager + Wilde admirably keep things unpretentious: the exposed brickwork sets the tone: they’re keeping things low key. The specials list changes regularly, and always with interesting choices introduced. Some of the wines are exclusive to this place, so you’re all but guaranteed to try something new. Have a SHE + T (sherry with tonic, delicious), and absolutely do not leave without having the grilled cheese sandwich. 38/50 7 Tales at Sosharu \n64 Turnmill St, EC1M 5RR, sosharulondon.com Underneath Jason Atherton’s Sosharu is this sexy, seedy Japanese drinking den, where you’ll find the hazy, debauched glamour of Tokyo after dark. Unlike so many bars underneath restaurants, 7 Tales doesn’t feel like a holding pen, and drinks are precision made, with flavours leaning beyond the usual – think rice-washed gin, sake, infusions of sesame, snacks like tempura. Bar snacks are an irresistible must. 39/50 Callooh Callay \n65 Rivington St, EC2A 3AY, calloohcallaybar.com Eccentric doesn’t seem to quite cover it: enter the surreal world of Callooh Callay through an old Victorian wardrobe, catch sight of a throne and order punch out of a gramophone from a menu that’s more of a sticker book. It sounds a bit ridiculous, but the bartenders really know their stuff, so for all the quirks, drinks are fundamentally pretty excellent. On the weekends, it’s a party bar, and DJs spin music to match: you’re here for a good time. Any detectives in your gang will find there are two extra rooms in Callooh Callay to explore – they’re hidden away, too, naturally. If you’re good, you might even get an invite upstairs to the Jub Jub Room, where the 10-long cocktail list changes every three weeks. Fans should also head to their new offering in Angel, Little Bat. 40/50 Dukes Bar \nDukes Hotel, 35 St James's Pl, SW1A 1NY, dukeshotel.com Duke’s is known for one reason: martinis. The St James’s hotel was a favourite haunt of James Bond author and (very) keen drinker, Ian Fleming, who supposedly came up with the ‘shaken, not stirred’ line here. Their martinis are exceptionally strong, and very large: there’s a reason they won’t serve you more than two. But look, break the mould: they’re a classic hotel bar, they serve a fine range of classic cocktails. There’s also a cognac and cigar garden, if you’re so inclined. 41/50 NOLA \n1st Floor, 68 Rivington Street, EC2A 3AY, nola-london.com It would be too easy to miss this place, so do your homework and saunter in: it’s must more attractive than sweatily asking anyone if they’ve seen the place. Drawing inspiration from the home of proper cocktails, New Orleans, the bar loves traditional drinks, builds them properly and serves them in a den of music and laughter. Unlike some places specialising in old school serves, NOLA is a place for fun: sure, it seems to say, you could have a quiet drink – but why would you want to? There’s a cracking cigar terrace too, small enough that everyone talks before heading back in for one hell of a Vieux Carré. 42/50 Call Me Mr Lucky \n11 Southwark St, SE1 1RQ, twitter.com All the ‘hidden’ bars at the Breakfast Clubs around the capital are popular, with perhaps The Mayor of Scaredy Cat Town being the best known. Call Me Mr Lucky, on Southwark Street, happens to be our favourite. Once you’ve flirted with the staff – ask to get lucky – you’re taken through the restaurant’s kitchens to a lively bar decorated like some twisted take on a kids party. Have a go on the wheel of fortune, where you’ll really want to get lucky, and win a free shot, and then work your way through the cocktail list. Like any good-time bar worth its salt, this place is big on tequila, and the drinks are light-hearted fun, but – here we go getting lucky again – along with the quirks comes quality. By the of the evening, before you’re porured back onto the street, you’ll swear tequila is your new favourite drink, and you’ll be singing the party hits they play all the way home. 43/50 K Bar at The Kensington \n109 - 113 Queen's Gate, SW7 5LP, townhousekensington.com K bar feels majestic – and there is no other word for it – because drinking here is a little like being in the captain’s quarters of the Titanic, albeit without the sinking feeling. There is glamour here: a kind of place to be seduced in. Cocktails wise, bar manager Ben Manchester is the man to ask for, but there’s a fine list to choose from. It avoids stuffiness, and just needs to be packed out to really get cooking. 44/50 Nightjar \n129 City Rd, EC1V 1JB, barnightjar.com Nightjar has fame which means writing about it is redundant: people think it marvellously good, and they’ve live music most of the week. It’s seating only and worth booking: just be sure not to cancel, or they’ll charge a steep £10 per person. They do the speakeasy theme, but well enough that it isn’t too tired yet, and have plenty of old school style on the list. Pick up a pack of cards from the bar on your way out. 45/50 Reverend J W Simpson \n32 Goodge St, W1T 2QJ, revjwsimpson.com Bourne and Hollingsworth run this rather lovely little bar, downstairs from a small doorway on Goodge St. Service is friendly and speedy, it's comfortable, and drinks more than hold their own – there's both obscure traditional mixes and modern serves made with fresh, seasonal ingredients. Luckily, with good drinks come good people, and it's a loud, happy place. 46/50 Albertine \n1 Wood Ln, W12 7DP, albertinewinebar.co.uk Albertine hasn’t changed much since the day East Enders was commissioned there. A wine bar through and through, you’ll struggle to get anything else (though there are a couple of ales on the menu.) It’s a place with spirit, which draws a regular, devoted crowd. They sell everything they serve, and it’s well worth splashing out: the mark-up gets less and less as the bottles get more expensive, meaning you can get an absolute bargain at the top end of the list. It’s also the kind of wine bar you go to to overindulge. 47/50 First Aid Box \n119 Dulwich Rd, SE24 0NG, firstaidbox2015.com This place really is worth travelling to Herne Hill to, which must be saying something. The team behind Shrub & Shutter have thickly laid on the pharmacy theme here, with ‘cure-all’ drinks. It’s not an idea which sounds like it should work, and yet, how much better life would be if they were one of the emergency services. Expect ‘saline’ drips, syringes, and the likes of plastic lungs – their take on thirst aid – but rest assured, flavours aren’t medicinal in the slightest. At £8 - 10 a drink, it’s reasonable for London, and wonderful to see a bar really trying something new. Bravo. Media Wisdom Photography - Giles Christopher 48/50 Nam Long Le Shaker \n159 Old Brompton Rd, SW5 0LJ, namlong.co.uk It gained fame for its celebrity fans, which include Mick Jagger and Prince Harry, but Nam Long has held on longer than most A-list haunts: it’s been going 30 years, and recently was given an overhaul. It’s quite possibly the most Chelsea place imaginable – there are literally MIC cast members floating about – and its a go-to spot to drink far too much and party. The upstairs area is bright, airy, and well looked after by the excellent bartenders, while downstairs – \"the Opium Den\" – is as it sounds (though there was no opium available when we asked... ) The drinks upstairs were made with more care, but downstairs is more intimate, opulent, and better for a small groups. Some of those Chelsea types who go really are the very worst, and the drinks are outrageously expensive, but hey, it’s a laugh. 49/50 The Vault at Milroy's \n3 Greek St, Soho, W1D 4NX, shop.milroys.co.uk A bar through a bookcase: we’re sold. Better yet, it’s underneath one of Soho’s finest whisky shops – with stiff competition from The Vintage House – so if you’re taken with something downstairs, buy it on your way out. It’s a simple little bar and the service is decidedly so-so, but it’s usually pretty busy, they play good music and have an excellent range of spirits. The menu is changed regularly, but it’s a good place to cram into with friends or on a date. You mightn’t spend the entire night here, but for a couple of drinks on the way somewhere, or on the way back, it fits the bill perfectly. 50/50 Bounce \n241 Old St, EC1V 9EY, bouncepingpong.com There are two Bounce bars, one on Old Street and one on Holborn. The Old Street spot is a little more fun, graffiti adorning the walls,the Holborn spot somewhat more upmarket. Still, they both deserve a mention, and for the simple reason they’re damned good fun. Drinks here are good, with a decent spirit selection at both (and a huge number of gins in Farringdon) and a respectable selection of beers. Food is fine, simple. Still, you come to play ping pong. They’ve tables everywhere. There’s little to fault with Bounce: it’s a laugh, and sometimes that’s all somewhere needs to be. \nPaulette Minott, Dirty Harry’s artistic director said: “Dirty Harry’s is going to be a great place to come after work or at the weekend and really let your hair down.” More about: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T13:39:05.140+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
