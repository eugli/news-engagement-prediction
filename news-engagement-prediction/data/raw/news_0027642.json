What if a propeller falls on me as I am walking along the street?” panellist Fifi Box joked. \nEver the contrarian, Aly challenged Box’s throwaway line. \n“I am more worried about the poor person in the drone,” he said. \nA perplexed Bickmore jumped in, saying: “The propeller could have chopped her head off.” \nWhile the back and forth ended unresolved, a similar tussle occurred just moments later when panellist Peter Helliar played a clip from I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here . \nIn the video, footballer Dane Swan was heard asking a peculiar question, wondering how many footballs he’d need to strap to himself in order to float in the ocean. \nAs Helliar and the panel laughed at the silly moment, Aly seemed to take it all a bit too seriously: “Wouldn’t they get waterlogged and then you would sink?” he informed everyone. \nAnd it hit a nerve with Bickmore. \n“Waleed! Stop! You want to pick a fight!,” she said, throwing her hands in the air. \n“Don’t worry about the propellers or the waterlogging!” \nHelliar agreed, joking: “Stop bringing logic to this show!” \n“Let’s talk about something else,” a more-composed Bickmore told viewers, moving on to the next news headline. \nThe tense moment comes just one night after Aly hit a nerve with viewers when he called admin workers “bogans”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T17:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T12:54:25.658+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
