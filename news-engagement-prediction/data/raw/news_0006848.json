I felt like I was a bud snapped off the vine before I had the chance to bloom. That’s fine, you make sacrifices for love.”\nMalkah told host Carrie Bickmore that Packer told her she had to stop working because “you’re going to be my wife and it’s tacky that you need to work”.\n“I just went shopping and had coffees with friends. He was under so much pressure and so much stress. He would sometimes come home and not talk to me.”\nKate Kischer aka Tziporah Malkah and James Packer. Picture: Instagram Source: Instagram \nShe said when things went wrong between them, the billionaire businessman’s closest friends “turned on” her and within six months she was out of the loop.\nThe 42-year-old used the interview to clear up confusion around compensation she received, money she said Packer’s friends and family deemed “ill-gotten”.\n“I looked like this horrible woman who’d run off with the Packer money,” she said.\n“He didn’t give me $10 million (as some had reported). James paid a million dollars for a house and we lived in it for two years and he said: ‘You can keep it’.\n“So I kept the house and he gave me a few hundred thousand dollars.”\nWith that, she said the tabloids turned on her, forcing her to flee the country. She worked in Hollywood for a time before meeting a man and falling in love again. But when he offered to invest her savings she lost it all.\n“Because we were in love and supposed to get married I said ‘OK’ and just gave it to him. It turns out he had this wife and child and he just took it.”\nThat’s when she moved back to Melbourne and into a shelter. She said she hid as best she could, terrified she would be identified.\nSelf-described Trump fan. Picture: Instagram Source: Instagram \nKate Fischer in 1998.

I felt so ashamed. I thought: ‘How am I going to explain this to anybody?’”\nThe interview touched on topics including her childhood and her mother, politician Pru Goward. She said the pair are no longer in touch.\n“I respect my mother. I understand my mother, but she’s not motherly.”\nShe also talked about the photos of her on her front lawn wearing a bed sheet. The images, captured by a photographer for gossip magazine Woman’s Day , thrust her back into the spotlight.\n“Apparently (the photographer) stalked me for nine weeks,” Malkah told The Project .\n“I’ve only got three outfits. My work uniform, my pair of jeans (and my black dress). Suddenly, one day I go to the mailbox and there it is. A sheet. The money shot.\n“I think it was intended to be humiliating.”\nHer plan now is to recover from the humiliation. She says she’s on her way.\n“I was a princess in an ivory tower. I didn’t see it. It didn’t occur to me what it’s like to really, really suffer. Since I’ve had this experience, it’s really made me want to come back.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T10:40:53.672+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
