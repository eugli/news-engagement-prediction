The former US national team coach put out a story on the Players' Tribune Wednesday detailing his time as an American coach abroad and addressing the end of his time in the EPL. \nWhile Bradley has mentioned an interest in coaching again in Europe, he has also not publicly ruled out a return to MLS, where he coached 1998-2006 for Chicago Fire, MetroStars and Chivas USA.
