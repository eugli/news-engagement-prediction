There's been chatter over the last week about whether Logan would include such a scene after rumors of three extra minutes being tacked on to the Wolverine spinoff made their way online. However, director James Mangold has finally set the record straight: Logan will not have an end-credits scene. \nWhen asked on Twitter if a Logan post-credits scene was something that he'd thought about \"since the beginning,\" James Mangold answered the the movie does not have such a scene. If that wasn't enough, Collider's Steve Weintraub, who reported on Monday that Logan would contain a few extra minutes of material at the end, checked with other sources and learned that he was wrong with his original report. However, he did note that there may still be something \"cool for the fans\" in Logan , though it may be shown before the movie has started instead. \nMuch like how he debunked the reports about Deadpool showing up in Logan that emerged before 2016 concluded, James Mangold has taken to social media to state that the third Wolverine movie will not have an end-credits scene. Combined with the Collider update, it's reasonable to assume that this information is legitimate rather than Mangold lying to keep fans in the dark. Hey, it's been known to happen! Remember when J.J. Abrams denied that Benedict Cumberbatch was playing Khan in Star Trek Into Darkness ? So unlike X-Men: Days of Future Past (well, technically that was a mid-credits scene), X-Men: Apocalypse and Deadpool , Logan won't be throwing an extra scene in one the names of everyone involved with the production have scrolled by. Still, the possibility of something \"extra\" being thrown in is intriguing. Some guesses that come to my mind are a special prologue or even some kind of short film unconnected to the main Logan story. With a little over a week until the movie is released to the masses, we won't have to wait much longer for an answer one way or the other. \nSet in the near-future, Logan will follow a weary Wolverine as he copes with his healing powers not working as well as they used to and taking care of an increasingly unstable Professor Charles Xavier. When a young girl named Laura who is very much like him shows up at his doorstep, Wolverine must protect her from operatives working for the organization Transigen and go on the run with her and Professor X so she can't be taken back. This will be Hugh Jackman 's final appearance as Wolverine, ending his 17-year career playing one of the world's most popular superheroes. \nLogan hits theaters next Friday, March 3, but for now, click here to read our review of the movie.
