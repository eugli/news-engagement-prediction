(Photo: Steven Ruiz) \nHOUSTON - Roughly eight million pounds of guacamole will be consumed on Super Bowl Sunday, and you better believe Tim Tebow will be doing his part. And you can hold the chips. \nAfter completing an interview with For the Win on radio row, Tebow, who was promoting Avocados from Mexico, busted out a container of guacamole and a spoon and just went to town. \nI, being the intrepid reporter I so clearly am, snapped a pic, because the people needed to know what was really going down in Houston. \nBut it was more of a nibble than a bite, and he left the uneaten chip behind. Tebow doesn't eat chips but he took a small bite out of this one. I feel like this is big news. pic.twitter.com/uXTHEffgXK â€” Steven Ruiz (@theStevenRuiz) February 3, 2017 \nAfter that, it was back to the spoon. And it only took the former NFL quarterback a few minutes to polish that container of guac off. \nPeople may find eating guacamole with a spoon kind of gross, but give Tebow credit for this: He's not just out there putting his name behind products he doesn't even use. Tebow clearly loves avocados. There's no denying that.
