Read at your own risk! \nLaurel Castillo vowed vengeance on those involved in Wes’ death, but she probably could never guess that the culprit lay so close to home. \nDuring How to Get Away with Murder ‘s two-hour finale, it appeared that A.D.A. Todd Denver (Benito Martinez) had manufactured the house fire — getting mysterious hit man Dominic (Nicholas Gonzalez) to murder Wes (Alfred Enoch) and blow the place up — in a bid to finally take down Annalise (Viola Davis). But it turns out he was working for — twist! — Laurel’s (Karla Souza) father, Jorge Castillo (Esai Morales). That’s right, the Mahoneys had nothing to do with it! How will Laurel react to this twist? EW turned to Souza to get the scoop. (Read our postmortem with EP Pete Nowalk here .) \nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Laurel’s father is actually responsible for Wes’ death! Why do you think that is? To get her away from Annalise? Does her dad just want to be near her? Is he mad that Wes got her pregnant? What’s your take? KARLA SOUZA: It could be all of the above, even something we don’t know. There might be a reveal. I think they’re going to humanize my father, so we’re going to find out a real reason why he decided to kill Wes, but I do think it has to be rooted in something rather than just for the sake of it. \nHow do you think Laurel will feel when she finds out her father is to blame? I think she’s going to go to the psychiatric ward. It’s such a crazy, crazy strong reveal. I don’t know how they’re going to write it, but I feel that she’s already going through so much and already been through so much, so I can’t even imagine how she’s going to react to that. \nDo you think she’ll feel some guilt over his death? Yeah, I think for sure. Even the Keating Four are probably going to point fingers at her, and she’s going to have to deal with that because it’s her father, so she has something to do with it, so it’s her fault, maybe. In the grand scheme of things, actually, she’s to blame for the death of Wes, basically. That’s how I think she’s going to see it. \nWhat can you tease of the relationship Laurel and Dominic have? When we auditioned, we played with a bunch of things with Nicholas, so there were options for us to be friends from diaper years, and then there’s others where we did have something romantic, and then there were others where he maybe just wanted something and I never did. That was interesting because then we filmed the scene that night, it’s almost like it had a bit of everything, so it leaves it open for the audience to take what they want. \nShe hesitated when she introduced him as a family friend, so do you think there’s something romantic there? That’s funny, the hesitation more was I had a gun in my hands, [ laughs ] but I really do think that there must’ve been from his end to mine. I think it would be interesting to play that because it would add to the messiness of it. But again, when we auditioned, we really did sometimes play the fact that we were really almost like brother and sister when we were younger, so Pete [Nowalk] could go either way with that, but the options are there and people will have their own take on it. That’s always good to see when it’s not as specific; the same with the ending where Annalise says, “He was my son,” people can take whatever they want from that. \nDoes seeing Dominic make her realize the Mahoneys aren’t actually to blame? No, it’s such a surprise, she’s not seen Dominic in such a long time, she never could even fathom thinking — she always thinks it’s the Mahoneys. It would be too quick. It’s not a situation where she could put those two together yet, and that’s what’s going to make it even more interesting that she has no idea about it, and then in season 4, there will be that reveal and surprise. \nShe was stopped before she could kill/torture/maim Charles, so do you think she’ll still be targeting him next year? Yeah, I think that’s her drive. She’s pregnant with Wes’ baby, she wants to get justice, she wants to avenge Wes’ death. Unfortunately, wanting the truth is going to probably lead her to finding out that her father was the one that did it. It’s almost like Oedipus in a sense that the worse thing that can happen is actually going to happen. I don’t know how they’re going to write that, but it’s a very fun story line for me to sink my teeth in for season 4. \nFor all intents and purposes, Connor did turn against Annalise. Laurel already told him to kill himself. Do you think she can ever trust him again? What does that relationship look like moving forward? I’m really interested to see how they write it, but I’ve gone through grief in my life, and if it’s someone really close to you, you really do turn tables and point fingers. It’s also Laurel’s way to get some steam off and really let out her anger, but I don’t think she really holds it against him. I really do think that she loves Connor as well, and she will come to understand the situation that he was in. But it’s an interesting dynamic within that relationship with how they bring themselves to forgive each other for everything that’s gone on. \nDo you hope we meet her mom next season, and do you have any dream casting for the role? My goodness, I would love if we meet Laurel’s mom. We’ve toyed with whether she’s still in Mexico, because she has mental health issues, so she might still be in Mexico or somewhere else. But I visited her for the summer. Who would be my dream casting? Let me think. Maybe Adriana Barraza. \nHow to Get Away with Murder is expected to return this fall on ABC.
