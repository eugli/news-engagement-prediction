Anti-Muslim incidents in Quebec: a timeline \n“We certainly believe in our Muslim community here and they don’t have to look over their shoulders,” Weighill said. \n“We know they’re peaceful, law-abiding people and we want to make sure they can get to the mosques safe, that they can pray safe, that their children get to school safe and come home from school safe and that they’re welcomed within our community.” \nREAD MORE: Saskatchewan Muslims condemn Quebec City terror attack \nWeighill said the police service is doing everything in its power to determine if there is any threat to the safety of residents here. \nSPS is working jointly with the RCMP and other law enforcement agencies and so far there is no intelligence to suggest that anyone’s safety is at risk in the city. \nREAD MORE: Justin Trudeau: ‘Make no mistake – this was a terrorist attack’ \nWeighill said there will be a police presence at local mosques during prayer in a show of solidarity and because safety is paramount to police. \nThe police chief has also vowed to visit every mosque in Saskatoon starting Monday night and discuss any concerns members of the community may have. Our thoughts go out to the victims, their families & all Muslims affected by the terrible tragedy last night in Quebec. \n— Saskatoon Police (@SaskatoonPolice) January 30, 2017 \nAt this time, there have been no complaints of xenophobia reported to Saskatoon police. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
