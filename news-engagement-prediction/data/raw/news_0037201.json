It was the greatest comeback in Super Bowl history and it netted Tom Brady his fourth Super Bowl MVP award , a record. \nThe guys at Sweetwater aren’t ones to welch on a bet, so they created the Patriots pale ale and gave it plenty of character. it’s the bet that keeps coming back to bite us in the ass @SamuelAdamsBeer .
