I was at Hillsborough. I've got witness statements.\"\nRead More Nigel Farage defends his \"good friend\" Arron Banks's right to free speech despite Ukip donor's Hillsborough slurs The Liverpool FC fan has also failed since Wednesday to condemn mega-donor Arron Banks, who said he was \"sick to death\" of hearing about the tragedy and campaigners were \"milking it\".\nThe Ukip leader wiped away a tear in his defiant conference speech (Photo: REUTERS) He failed to answer a shouted question about Mr Banks in the chaotic scrum.\nMr Nuttall's refusal to face the media, on a major conference day for his party, came after he angrily denied claims he may not have been at Hillsborough himself.\nDuring his speech he wiped away a tear as the party faithful gave him roaring cheers - including a few who stood in his honour - when he asked if he still had their support.\nHe said: \"I will not allow them to break me and I will not allow them to break Ukip\" (Photo: PA) But he was then bundled out of a side exit amid heavy security (Photo: PA) He told the 500-odd guests, in a hall round the back of Bolton's Macron Stadium: \"Thank you, I'm a bit overwhelmed.\"\nOne audience member shouted back: \"Take that!\"\nMr Nuttall said: \"Many of you will have noticed that I've had a bit of a difficult week. This is two fold actually.\n\"Firstly I take the blame for the fact that I failed to check what was put on my website in my name. That is my fault and I apologise.\nHe branded claims about Hillsborough a \"cruel and almost evil smear campaign\" (Photo: REUTERS) Have your say in the comments section below Comment Below \"But I do not apologise for what is a coordinated, cruel and almost evil smear campaign that has been directed towards me.\n\"It is based on lies from sources who have not been named.\n\"It has been a tough week for me but I will not allow them to break me and I will not allow them to break Ukip.\"\nThe defiant speech came after Nigel Farage defended his \"good friend\" Mr Banks' right to free speech despite his slurs against Hillsborough campaigners - saying he is \"entitled to his own views\".\nSpeaking to reporters at Ukip's spring conference in Bolton, Mr Farage also dramatically accused Labour of intervening to stop Mr Nuttall getting involved in Hillsborough support groups.\nFarage also refused to condemn claims about being \"sick to death\" of Hillsborough... (Photo: PA) ... from Ukip's donor Arron Banks (Photo: PA) Asked if Mr Banks' comments were representative of Ukip's mission he said: \"He's a good friend of mine and he says all sorts of things on Twitter.\"\nAsked if he was \"happy to be associated\" with someone who said they were \"sick to death\" of hearing about the tragedy, he replied: \"I'm not saying I'll never speak to him again.\"\nHe insisted: \"I'm not defending Arron... I'm not his spokesman. Get his spokesman.\"\nBut asked by the Mirror if Ukip leader Paul Nuttall should condemn Mr Banks, he then said: \"Arron Banks is a private citizen entitled to his own views.\"\nAsked if the views were offensive to Liverpool FC supporter Nuttall he said: \"They may be. Ask him!\"\nDuring his speech Mr Nuttall revealed UKIP would scrap VAT on fish and chips, heating bills and tampons if it took power after Brexit .\nHe vowed to bring in a “British values” test for new immigrants and cut off foreign aid to countries like India and Brazil, spending the money on the NHS instead.\nAnd he launched a scathing attack on Labour for “sneering at our flag” and “thinking Brexit is racist” - claiming UKIP would “replace the Labour party as the voice of patriotic working people”.\n Politics Newsletter Follow @MirrorPolitics Subscribe to our Politics Politics UKIP", "external_links": ["https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/trinity-images/logos/mirror.png", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorPolitics", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MirrorPolitics", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/1063/4221396001_5326861215001_5326843694001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001"], "published": "2017-02-17T15:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T06:49:07.142+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
