The bald eagle has been the national emblem of the United States since 1782 and a spiritual symbol for native people for far longer than that. (Photo Credit: Jerry Bishop) \nThey said they couldn’t help but notice as “a very large bird” flew over them while they were sitting on their back porch. \nIn awe, they watched as it landed about 1000 feet away in one of their trees. \nImmediately they noticed it wasn’t like any kind of bird they had seen before. \nJerry Bishop ran to his house, picked up his 600mm lens and started taking pictures of the majestic bald eagle. \nBald eagles begin nesting from mid-February to March, so this is a good time to catch a glimpse of one if you’re lucky. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T10:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T05:29:21.592+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
