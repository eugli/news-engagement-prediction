Trust me, it’s scary to hell. If you don’t eat for two days you feel so frustrated, angry on everything. There were times when there was a blackout. I used to get up and sit quietly for a moment. But that’s the fun of being an actor. I feel very lucky to play such parts and work with such filmmakers.” Read more Gear up for a scary ride: Rajkummar Rao in Trapped teaser \nThe National-award-winning actor, best known for working in biopics like Shahid and Aligarh, says he doesn’t spend time thinking if he is bankable at the box office as these are things beyond his control. “That (box office) is something which is not under my control, I can’t help it. So there is no point thinking about it and feeling sad or happy. My only job is to act and play the character truthfully and honestly,” he said. \nRajkummar says he would rather focus on portraying his character with full honesty than thinking about being a star. “Being a star is accidental. You can be a star with one film but what about your next ten films? So my job is just to be constant and be honest towards my craft which I try. Being a star is the byproduct of your work. I hope we have a ‘star actor’ since you’re saying there are ‘stars’ and ‘actors’.” Rajkummar rao in a still from Trapped. \nThe 32-year-old actor was speaking at the trailer launch of his upcoming firm Trapped. \nRajkummar says he personally never differentiates between a commercial project and an indie film. “I think that line between indie cinema and commercial is thinning. There isn’t not much a difference between them. If you put four songs and one item number, it will become a commercial film. I really don’t differentiate between a commercial or an indie film. For me it’s the story which matters and the filmmakers.” \nTrapped is scheduled to release on March 17. \nFollow @htshowbiz for more ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T17:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:27:39.596+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
