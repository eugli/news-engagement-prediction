Brady completed six passes against an overmatched Falcons secondary. A pass interference call took the ball to the two-yard line, and White scooted to his right and barely over the goal line. \nIt was almost an impossible dream for the Patriots a bit earlier. But helped by Matt Ryan's fumble on a sack, Julian Edelman's catch off of a defender's shoe, and Brady's passing, they never stopped coming. \nWhite scored three touchdowns and had 14 receptions for 110 yards, but Brady hit seven different receivers.

(AP: Eric Gay) \nUntil the Patriots took charge with their late surge, league MVP Ryan was outplaying Brady. \nAtlanta's defence backed up its high-octane offence, getting two sacks on the Patriots' next drive in what would be a scoreless opening quarter. \nIt sure looked as if the Patriots would get on the board immediately in the second period as Brady and Edelman connected twice for 40 yards, but it was not to happen. \nBlanketed by defenders all night, Atlanta's Julio Jones still showed why he is an All-Pro receiver with a tough leaping catch over the middle for 19 yards, then got open on the sideline for 23 and running back Devonta Freeman did the rest.

Using the no-huddle attack to perfection, he threw for 51 yards on a 52-yard drive, hitting tight end Austin Hooper with a pinpoint pass in the left side of the end zone. \nThen Brady was victimised by his own poor decisions, a rarity on the big stage. Atlanta was called for defensive holding three times on third downs to keep a Patriots drive alive. From the Falcons' 23, Brady tried to squeeze a throw to Danny Amendola under pressure. \nBut Robert Alford stepped in to intercept, then glided 82 yards for the second-longest pick six in a Super Bowl and Brady's first. Shockingly, it was 21-0. \nNew England gathered its wits for a 52-yard drive to Stephen Gostkowski's 41-yard field goal, but it was 21-3 when Lady Gaga took the stage at half-time. \nThe Falcons kept coming, marching 85 yards to Tevin Coleman's six-yard touchdown catch on a swing pass, but that was when New England and the Patriots kicked off their miraculous comeback, adding to Atlanta's long history of pro sports frustration.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T10:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T16:29:14.786+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
