(File photo) Chris Gerbasi   \nLEESBURG — Beacon College plans to extend its reach to help students who learn differently and train the teachers who educate them. \nThe Leesburg-based college recently received a $50,000 grant from a New Jersey charity to develop two new postgraduate programs. One, called First Career, will help students transition to residential life and employment. The second, the Beacon Certificate, will better equip college educators to teach to the strengths of students with different learning needs. \nBeacon is the first accredited college offering four-year degrees designed around the needs of students diagnosed with learning disabilities, dyslexia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and related conditions. The college’s graduation and employment rates, both about 83 percent, far exceed national averages for private colleges and universities, college President George Hagerty said. \nThe innovative programs will serve as models for other institutions that want to improve their rates for these types of students, he said. \n“These are concepts we know, from requests from educators outside Beacon, are pretty essential to benefit students who learn differently,” Hagerty said. \nThe grant was awarded by the David R. Clare and Margaret C. Clare Foundation, which funds higher education and human services. \n“We consider our funding an investment in your leadership, Beacon’s mission and this program in particular,” David R. Clare Jr., managing director of the foundation, said in a news release. \nFirst Career will be a two-year communal experience in which members live together, engage in service and learning opportunities and attend weekly group sessions under the guidance of mentors. The start date is about 15 months away as Beacon develops and field-tests curriculum. \nThe program will be set up off campus in the Orlando area, with 12 to 15 graduate students participating in the first year, Hagerty said. Most will be Beacon grads, though graduates of other colleges are eligible. \nStudents must have learning differences and must work full-time entry-level jobs at national corporate partners such as JP Morgan, JetBlue, Sea World and Disney World. Hagerty hopes to line up a dozen more national companies in the next two years. \nBeacon’s focus is placing graduates in the professional world, he said. First Career will give graduates the life and job skills necessary to dent jobless rates for workers with learning differences and ADHD. \n“From talking to other educators, this is going to be a highly successful model,” Hagerty said. \nThe Beacon Certificate is a four-course graduate program for active teachers who will gain Beacon’s expertise in teaching students how to master content according to the learning mode, such as visual or auditory, in which they’re strongest. \n“There’s diversity of students regardless of the institution,” Hagerty said. \nThe certificate program will be open to teachers from all over the country, and courses will be available in both traditional and online formats. Hagerty hopes to have the curriculum developed by the end of summer 2017 and, after a year of field-testing, courses will be available in July 2018.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:22:45.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
