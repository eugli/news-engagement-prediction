Article continues below \nAt 30-years-old, Blount has made it pretty clear that he doesn’t want to leave New England, however. \n\"I just want to make sure that I go to this free agency with an open mind knowing that I definitely want to go back to New England,\" Blount said on NFL Total Access on Monday .

I've become close with a lot of the guys. Obviously you know how my running back group is. We'll cross that bridge whenever we cross it. On that point, I feel great. I'm in amazing shape. I feel like I could play 100 more years if I have to.” \nBlount’s willingness to cede carries to both Dion Lewis and Super Bowl hero James White down the stretch during the team’s playoff run led to a three-headed monster of harmony in the Patriots backfield. \nIf he were to be re-signed, he would likely serve in a power-back role like last season, thriving in short-yardage and goal-line situations. White and Lewis will probably split third-down duties and all three would remain important parts of New England’s well-oiled offensive machine. \nComing off a team-friendly, one-year, $1 million deal last season, Blount will likely receive a bit of a raise, but like many other Patriots stars in the past, he will need to take a discount to stay with New England. \nBut, he’s been down this road before and has proven that money isn’t everything to him, which is more than can be said about a lot of other NFL players. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
