The building in downtown Birmingham will soon offer a variety of new culinary concepts all under one roof. A few stalls opened Wednesday, with more to follow later this week and in coming weeks. The 20,000-square-foot food hall, which was originally announced in early 2016 will also include a stall that will serve as a revolving incubator for local chefs.

Tropicaleo, Busy Corner Cheese & Provisions, Waffle Works, Revelator Coffee, Eli’s Jerusalem Grill and Yellowhammer Creative will be open Thursday. Lichita's is set to open Friday. “The Pizitz Food Hall will bring a new culinary experience to Birmingham and will become a place for people to gather and enjoy interesting food, as well as time with family and friends,” said Jeffrey Bayer , president and CEO of Bayer Properties . “The wide variety of cuisine we secured for The Pizitz Food Hall is unlike anything else in Birmingham or even Alabama. We can’t wait for the city to experience these unique and exciting culinary delights.” As we recently reported , Birmingham firm Appleseed Workshop designed many of Food Hall stalls. Additionally, Yellowhammer Creative designed the Food Hall logo and signage. Two full-service restaurants, Ghion Cultural Hall and Fero will both operate at Pizitz as well. Ghion offers Ethiopian dining, and Fero is a restaurant from New York chefs Akhtar Nawab and Matt Wagman that features a modern take on rustic Italian cuisine. The bar in the center of the Food Hall will be called The Louis, after original building owner Louis Pizitz . The Louis will offer milkshakes, handmade sodas, craft cocktails and local beers. That establishment should open Friday. An official opening is planned for a later date. The list of tenant restaurants includes: Alabama Biscuit Co. – Flaky, sweet and savory biscuits featuring an array of toppings, including everything from local honey and almond butter to fried bologna and pork belly. This will be the second location for Birmingham’s beloved breakfast spot. Busy Corner Cheese & Provisions – Brian McMillan , a longtime local distributor with The Cheese Advocate, will open Busy Corner Cheese & Provisions featuring farmstead and artisanal cheese and related specialty items. Busy Corner Cheese & Provisions also will serve sandwiches that are a creative take on the classic grilled cheese. The Standard by Matt Ralph which is a traditional burger and hot dog joint Choza Taqueria – Channeling a beachside hut in northern Mexico, this taqueria with a sister restaurant in Gotham West Market in New York City, will feature fresh dishes, including tacos, burritos, bowls and salads. Dosa – A dish similar to a crepe, dosas are made of rice and lentils with authentic spices and served with coconut chutney, vegetable stews and a variety of toppings. Eli’s Jerusalem Grill – The second location for this Birmingham favorite will serve homemade Israeli cuisine, including shawarma, salads, falafel and kabobs. Ichicoro Ramen – A mod-casual ramen noodle house that will serve a new style of ramen inspired by Latin flavors, local produce and hot temperatures found in its home city of Tampa, Florida. Lichita’s – Lichita’s ice cream and Mexican paletas are reminiscent of southern Mexico and created using fresh fruit and quality ingredients from farmers markets and local sources.

Ono Poké – Drawing inspiration from his childhood in Hawaii, Vinh Tran will introduce Birmingham to poké, an intersection of Japanese and Hawaiian cuisine comprised of raw fish and imported seaweed served on a bed of rice or greens. Reveal Kitchen – Reveal Kitchen will serve as an incubator for Birmingham’s up-and-coming restaurateurs, which will rotate quarterly. The stall is supported by REV Birmingham and will serve as a proof of concept opportunity for culinary graduates of Create Birmingham’s CO.STARTERS program, a joint effort of both organizations. Revelator Coffee – Choosing coffees to fit a simple, seasonal menu, Revelator Coffee roasts the coffee to celebrate each unique character. Similar to its other location in Birmingham, the stall will feature food and goods from local purveyors that complement the coffee.
