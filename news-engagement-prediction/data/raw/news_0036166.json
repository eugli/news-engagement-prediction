(Source: PTI) \n0930 IST: Play underway at Brabourne Stadium with Mitchell Marsh on 17 and Matthew Wade on 8. Navdeep Saini bowling from one end for India A and Hardik Pandya on the other \nIndia ‘A’ are playing Australia to give the visitors some much needed test ahead of the bigger tussle that awaits them in Pune starting Feb 23. On Day 1, India A captained by Hardik Pandya won the toss and opted to bowl first. Australia, batting first, had a merry time playing the seam attack with plenty of spin options not getting the purchase as they would have liked and K Goutham sitting out after suffering from cramps in the hot and dry conditions of Mumbai. This allowed Steve Smith and Shaun Marsh to smack centuries and then draw play to a close at 327/5. India A bagged two early wickets but couldn’t make the most of the opportunity as the wicket turned flat with play progressing. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Best of Express ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T16:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T06:11:43.633+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
