Oh, and there will indeed be a quad-core model.\nAMD engineers made the disclosure in a paper this week during the International Solid-State Circuits Conference in San Francisco, according to EE Times' Rick Merritt.\nThe engineering paper said a quad-core Ryzen chip built on a 14nm process would be about 10 percent smaller than a comparable 6th-generation Intel Skylake CPU built on a 14nm process, while offering twice the L2 cache of the Intel chip. The paper appears to count only the amount of space used for the x86 cores on an Intel CPU in its comparison. Like other mainstream CPUs, Intel’s Skylake chips also include graphics cores aboard.\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T13:04:39.605+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
