Salalima INQUIRER.net / 07:14   DICT Sec. Salalima said he wants open communication between stakeholders, telcos and consumers to iron out problems on internet service. Image: Alfred Bayle \nSlow and unreliable internet service in the country has often been the subject of ridicule, and even a few memes. However, Department of Information and Communications Technology Secretary Rodolfo Salalima is looking to change the situation for the better. \nIn a press briefing for the upcoming Philippine Telecoms Summit 2017, Salalima expressed that the upcoming summit will be a “no holds barred” conference. He hopes that, what he believes to be the three main concerns of consumers (internet speed, affordability, coverage), will all be openly discussed. \nSalinas expresses that during the summit, even consumers will be able to raise critiques to the current system. They will also be heard should they be offering possible solutions. ADVERTISEMENT \n“I want the problems and challenges all out during the Summit, because if not, we will not know how to find a solution,” Salalima said. \nThe Philippine Telecoms Summit 2017 will be held on March 9 and 10 at the Philippines International Convention Center Forum. Updates on the event can be found on the DICT Facebook page, Twitter account and official site. \nDespite recent reports of mobile internet having improved, majority of consumers still find it difficult to find satisfaction in the service that telcos are offering. The summit is expected to help raise the overall internet quality in the country.
