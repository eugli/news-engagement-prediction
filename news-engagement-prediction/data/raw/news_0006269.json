Article continues below \nFirst of all, they lost one of their key performers from last season - arguably *the* standout performer - in N’Golo Kante. \nLeicester have looked a shadow of the team that won the title last season without the French midfielder in their ranks. Article continues below Kevin Nolan signs himself for Notts County \nSecondly, they’ve struggled with the demands of combining the Premier League with Champions League football. \nAnd thirdly, it was never going to be possible to replicate what they achieved last season. It just wasn’t. \nLeicester currently find themselves 15th in the Premier League table, four points from safety, and are in serious danger of being dragged into a relegation dogfight. It would be no surprise, given their recent form, if they were relegated to the Championship in May. Ulloa has just given Ranieri a major headache \nRanieri, who already had enough to worry about, has now been given another problem by Leonardo Ulloa. \nThe Argentine striker has stunned Leicester fans with the following tweet… \n“With all respect for LCFC FANS. I feel betrayed by Ranieri and let down by the club. I will not play again for them…” Twitter reaction to Ulloa's tweet \nAnd it's definitely his real account... \nIt seems he’s going down the same route as Dimitri Payet to force a move late in the transfer window. Ulloa trying to force a move to Sunderland? \nIt’s unclear why Ulloa feels betrayed by his manager, although the striker has been linked with a transfer to Sunderland in recent days. \nLeicester have reportedly rejected a £7 million bid for the forward, who fell down the pecking order at the King Power Stadium following the high-profile arrivals of Ahmed Musa and Islam Slimani, and perhaps he was told that he could move if an acceptable bid was made for his services. \nRanieri, though, is keen to keep all of his players ahead of what promises to be a very interesting next few months. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
