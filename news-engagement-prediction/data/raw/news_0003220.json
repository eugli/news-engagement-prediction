On Tuesday, Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee boycotted the hearings of Tom Price, Trump’s pick to head the Health and Human Services Committee, and Treasury Department nominee Steve Mnuchin, over allegations that both provided “inaccurate” testimony about their knowledge of improper and illegal activity in previous business dealings. \nSen. Sessions has come under similar scrutiny over his belatedly delivered nomination questionnaires for attorney general. \n“I noticed some discrepancies in the way he had described his involvement in civil rights cases filed during his time as a U.S. attorney,” Minnesota Democratic Sen. Al Franken said of Sessions at Wednesday’s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. Sessions had previously failed to be confirmed as a federal judge by a Republican-led Senate in the 1980s. \nFranken has already announced that he will vote against Sessions and last month told the senator that he thought he was exaggerating his leadership and involvement in 1980s era civil rights cases in one of his nomination questionnaires for attorney general. \n“I asked him about his claim that he has filed twenty or thirty desegregation cases, a claim he made in a 2009 interview with the National Review. In response, Sen. Sessions said, ‘the records do not show that there were twenty or thirty actually filed cases,'” Franken recalled. “I then went on to question him about four questions that he listed on his questionnaire which ask him to list ‘the ten most significant litigated matters he personally handled. Among those cases listed on his questionnaire were three voting rights cases and a desegregation case. \n“Now that surprised me,” Franken continued, “that’s because I know Sen. Sessions and I know Sen. Sessions is no champion of voting rights.” \nFranken pointed out that Sessions “called the Voting Rights Act ‘intrusive’ and complained about states with a history of discrimination being subject to preclearance, but here he seemed to be trumpeting his personal involvement in three voting rights cases and one school desegregation cases.” \nWith a tone of incredulity, Franken dug in. “I guess it just seemed to me that given his previous experience before this committee, and given the concern that civil rights advocates have expressed about his nomination, that perhaps Sen. Sessions or the transition team was attempting to revise that history and recast him as a civil rights champion.” That time Sen Al Franken proved Jeff Sessions to be lying about his record on his AG application about championing civil rights cases. pic.twitter.com/rIYLeEe5Ab \n— Ahmed Shihab-Eldin (@ASE) February 1, 2017 \nAfter excoriating the myth of Sessions as a conservative crusader for civil rights, Franken turned his attention to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Cruz previously criticized Franken’s questioning of Sessions as rude and accused Franken of using the incident to “undermine [Sessions’] character and integrity.” \n“It is unfortunate to see members of this body impugn a fellow senator with whom we have served for years,” Cruz recently said of Franken. “It is particularly unfortunately when the attack is not backed up by the facts.” \nBut Franken argued Wednesday that it was Cruz who had misrepresented the facts by incorrectly stating that testimony provided in 1986, which accused Sessions of making racially insensitive remarks, had been recanted. \nBefore Franken could finish correcting the record, Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn objected and said he didn’t think it was fair that Franken would take issue with a senator not in attendance. \n“Well he should be here, first of all,” Franken said, “And secondly he disparaged me, senator.” \nFranken kept on his attack. \n“Mr. Chairman, I object again. The senator apparently get the message from the chairman that this is … ,” Cornyn cut in, before Franken interrupted again. \n“Senator Cruz did the very thing that Senator Cornyn is accusing me of doing,” Franken said. “He misrepresented me, he misrepresented Mr. Hebert, he personally went after me, he personally impugned my integrity. You didn’t object then did you?!” \nChairman Chuck Grassley then told Franken to continue his speech: “You’ve put the chairman at an awful bad position at this point … Could you please leave personalities out of it?” \nFranken continued, only to be interrupted with another objection from Cornyn, who said, “It would be a decent and honorable thing to do it in the senator’s presence.” \n“Well get him here, but he’ll have a tape of it” Franken said. “I think the senator from Texas doesn’t get the message from the chairman.” \n“When describing this history, Sen. Cruz misrepresented what happened,” Franken said. “So I would like to take this opportunity to set the record straight.” \nWatch below: \nRepublicans, however, went on to confirm Sessions, 11-9 along party lines. All of the panel’s Democrats voted against Sessions. Sophia Tesfaye is Salon's Deputy Politics Editor and biggest Golden State Warriors fan in Brooklyn.
