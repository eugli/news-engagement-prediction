It will close the hot springs for further investigation,” he added. \nDr Norhizan said the rotavirus, which infects the stomach and intestines, usually attacks children, especially those aged five and below. \n“The symptoms are diarrhoea, vomiting, fever and abdominal pain. \n“The patient could suffer severe dehydration and die if not treated early,” he said. \nHe said, among others, the virus is spread through the stools of those infected.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T03:42:09.807+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
