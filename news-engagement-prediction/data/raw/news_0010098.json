Panneerselvam and not for AIADMK interim general secretary V.K. Sasikala. \nTranslated, the letter says the following: \n\"Dear honourable MLA: This is a voice of a Tamilian who has voted for you. We have sent several representations like water issues, proper roads, proper lighting in our locality, building of schools, but now we are asking for a Chief Minister. The news says 134 MLAs are supporting V.K. Sasikala, but people belonging to 234 constituencies are supporting O. Panneerselvam. So, we ask you to support Mr. Panneerselvam as Chief Minister. Otherwise we will boycott your offices. This is not a request from the people. This is our order. If you do this, we will be very happy. We ask you to act according to your conscience at least once in your life.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T12:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T07:22:06.301+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
