SUPPLIED \nThe Glover family say they will remember Lara as a \"bubbly and outgoing\" girl. \nIt meant Glover was by her only daughter's side shortly after emergency services arrived. \nREAD MORE: \n\"I did have that moment, and I will cherish it always,\" Glover said.

My daughter didn't die for someone to get crucified for it. \n\"My message is for these kids to be safe and kind to each other. Look out for one another because you never know, this could happen to anybody.\" \nLara was the youngest of seven children in the Glover family, with six brothers. \nHer mum said they shared a special bond.
