Man lost a bet so downed a litre of vodka in 40 seconds \nHe then told the girl to go to bed, and to tell her mum that she just had a stomach ache. \nAustralia’s 9News reported that by midday the next day, the child had become pale and limp – and was tragically declared dead in hospital soon afterwards. \nThe 22-year-old man, who can’t be named for legal reasons, has now pleaded guilty to child homicide over the girl’s death in 2015. The man is due to be sentenced on February 24 (Picture: Rex) \nSenior crown prosecutor Kerri Judd QC told the Victorian Supreme Court in Melbourne, Australia: ‘In frustration, he turned her around and stepped on her stomach with one foot. \n‘He took his other foot off the ground, thereby putting his entire weight on her.’ Man shot dead after spray painting penis on car and firing at officers \nPsychologist Patrick Newton, who had treated the man, told the court that he kept quiet about his crime because ‘shame, guilt and fear had left him paralysed’. \nThe child’s mother was visibly grief-stricken during the hearing, and had to excuse herself from the court many times as the graphic details of the crime were revealed. \nIn her victim impact statement, read to the court, she said: ‘I was lied to for seven months when he knew the truth. I no longer trust anyone after being betrayed… like this.’ \nThe girl’s biological father also said he suffered severe anxiety, and had lost 44kg since his daughter’s death. \nThe man is due to be sentenced on February 24.
