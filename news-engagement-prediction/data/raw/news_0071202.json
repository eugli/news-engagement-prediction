Miss Rudd said: 'Cressida Dick is an exceptional leader, and has a clear vision for the future of the Metropolitan Police and an understanding of the diverse range of communities it serves.' Before settling on her choice, she had to 'have regard' to any recommendation from the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime, which is headed by Sadiq Khan. The Oxford-educated top cop who led the de Menezes operation Cressida Dick is perhaps best known for her role as the senior commander in charge of the botched operation that led to the fatal shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes at Stockwell Tube station in 2005. She oversaw the operation that led to officers mistakenly identifying the Brazilian (pictured above) as an on-the-run suicide bomber, two weeks after the July 7 London bombings. The Metropolitan Police was successfully prosecuted for health and safety failings, but in an unusual move the jury attacked the Met but said it did not hold Miss Dick responsible. The child of two academics and educated at Balliol College, Oxford, Miss Dick briefly worked in accounting before signing up the police and rising through the ranks. She joined the Met in 1983, working as the national lead for counter-terrorism and playing a big role in the security operation around the 2012 Olympics. Miss Dick became the UK's most senior female officer when she was made an Assistant Commissioner in 2009. She retired from the Met in 2014 to take up a low-profile role as a director general at the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office but is now back at the force to take on the top job. The mayor said today: 'She has already had a long and distinguished career, and her experience and ability has shone throughout this process. 'On behalf of all Londoners, I warmly welcome Cressida to the role and I very much look forward to working with her to keep our capital safe and protected.' Meanwhile Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson tweeted: 'Congrats to Cressida Dick - first women to lead the Met and a fantastic officer. Huge thanks to BHHowe for his amazing leadership and service.' Miss Dick was widely seen as the leading candidate for the job after Sir Bernard's retirement was announced last year. Sir Bernard has previously praised Miss Dick as 'a fantastic leader' and 'a role model for women across the service'. Today, he said she had achieved 'an incredible amount and deserves the post', adding that she is 'a very talented person' and 'will be a brilliant beacon for women within and beyond this force'. Three other senior figures were also contenders - Mark Rowley, an assistant commissioner at the Met; Sara Thornton, the chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council; and Stephen Kavanagh, the chief constable of Essex Police. Ms Dick's appointment means that all three top policing jobs in the UK are now held by women - the commissioner, the NPCC head and National Crime Agency chief Lynne Owens. Sir Bernard has delivered various stark warnings in the final weeks of his tenure. Last month he said the 'warning lights are flashing' after figures laid bare the scale of fraud and cyber crime and showed a jump in violent offences recorded by forces. He also warned his successor will have to run the Met with fewer officers as the service braces for further budget squeezes. Reaction to the appointment of 'exceptional leader' Cressida Dick 'My warmest congratulations to Cressida Dick. She's achieved an incredible amount and deserves the post - a very talented person. Cressida Dick is the first female Commissioner of the Met Police and will be a brilliant beacon for women within and beyond this force.' Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, outgoing Metropolitan Police commissioner 'Congrats to Cressida Dick - first women to lead the Met and a fantastic officer. Huge thanks to BHHowe for his amazing leadership and service.' Boris Johnson, Foreign Secretary 'Cressida Dick is an exceptional leader, and has a clear vision for the future of the Metropolitan Police and an understanding of the diverse range of communities it serves. I am delighted Her Majesty has agreed my recommendation after a rigorous recruitment process which highlighted the quality of senior policing in this country.' Home Secretary Amber Rudd 'Cressida Dick will be the first female Commissioner of the Met in its 187-year history, and the most powerful police officer in the land. She has already had a long and distinguished career, and her experience and ability has shone throughout this process. On behalf of all Londoners, I warmly welcome Cressida to the role and I very much look forward to working with her to keep our capital safe and protected.' Sadiq Khan, Mayor of London 'Congrats to Cressida Dick, first female boss of Metropolitan Police in its 188-year history. Bigger boost for women's rights than any Madonna rant.' Piers Morgan, DailyMail.com U.S. Editor-at-Large 'Congratulations to Cressida Dick - great to finally have the Met's first ever woman police commissioner' Karen Buck, Westminster North MP Cressida Dick now officially the most successful Balliol 'man' (that's a gender neutral term of art, really!) of my generation. Top cop! Robert Peston, ITV political editor 'I've worked with Cressida Dick and I know she will be an outstanding Commissioner for the Metropolitan Police. Congratulations.' James Cleverly, Braintree MP 'A new model commissioner for the MPS, Cressida Dick appointed to British policing top job. An historical milestone. At your service, ma'am.'
