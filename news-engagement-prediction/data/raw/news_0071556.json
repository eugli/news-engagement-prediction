Image copyright Charlies Chance Foundation Image caption Now Charlie has had financial clearance from the hospital, the treatment will start as soon as possible \nCharlie has been ill since the age of three, she said. \nAfter a third relapse in April she said there was \"no option\" left for treatment for him in the UK. \nMrs Fearns said the family, of Litherland, were left \"heartbroken\" when the first T-Cell transplant did not work. 'Fight tooth and nail' \nShe said the news the treatment has been paid for was \"completely overwhelming\". \n\"We don't know who this donor is but from the bottom of our hearts it means an incredible amount - not just from the foundation but everybody that supports Charlie.\" \nCharlie's father Rob Fearns said they were \"extremely grateful\" for the generosity of the anonymous donation. \n\"He or she specifically asked to pay for Charlie. \n\"We thought we were going to have to fight tooth and nail like last time to get the funds together.\" Image copyright Twitter \nHis parents said they received the confirmation via an email from the hospital on Wednesday saying someone had offered to foot the bill for them. \nNow Charlie has had financial clearance from the hospital, the treatment will start as soon as possible. \nMr Fearns said he is expecting to find out the date next week. T-Cell Immunotherapy Facts Seattle Children's doctors and researchers are running clinical trials in children, adolescents and young adults with T-Cell immunotherapy which they claim boost the immune system. T cells are white blood cells in the immune system that fight infection. In T-cell therapy, T cells are taken from the child's blood and using laboratory techniques, medics attempt to reprogram the T cells to recognize cancer cell. They grow them into billions of T-cells in the hope that when they are put back in the patient's body they seek out and destroy cancer cells without harming normal, healthy cells. Seattle Children's said it is the only hospital enrolling paediatric patients in these trials. \nInformation from Seattle Children's Hospital", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:03:37.166+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
