(ABC Wide Bay: Jess Lodge) A bittersweet goodbye \nFor the Sea Life staff who raised the turtles, the day of their release was one of mixed feelings. \n\"It's going to be sad to say goodbye. But at the same time we're really happy and excited to find out more information about them,\" aquarist Kaleesha Strickland said. \n\"It's very cool to see where they started out from and where they're going to,\" fellow aquarist Izaac Liley said. \nAs the boat came to a stop about 20 kilometres off the coast, the aquarists took it in turns to release the young turtles one by one into the ocean. \n\"To be honest I did shed a tear when I released my one,\" Ms Taylor said. \n\"But it's such an awesome feeling to see them back out in the ocean.\" \nDiver Annie Gray has spent the past year watching the turtles grow and said it was a rewarding moment to watch them swimming away. \n\"When you see something grow it's sort of your mothering instinct to protect them and want them to have a good and happy life,\" Ms Gray said. \n\"It's just nice to be putting something back and it's nice to be able to help the species hopefully survive a long time into the future. \n\"And if the information we get from this helps us to help the species down the track then it's certainly been completely worthwhile.\" \nThe next group of flatbacks will on display at the World Science Festival in Brisbane in March, before an extended stay at Sea Life.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T08:54:16.443+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
