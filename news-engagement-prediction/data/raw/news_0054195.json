The restaurant headed up by chef Carl Schaubhut of Bacobar is slated to arrive next month at 1801 Oak Street next to the recently opened Simone’s Market. Designed by Valerie Legras and architect Brooks Graham, DTB (which stands for “down the bayou”) will feature a stainless steel open kitchen with “Spanish moss accents and lighting” and a 10-seat rusted, corrugated tin bar with a mother of pearl backsplash and “floating white shelves.” Two communal white oak tables will be located in the bar area, while white quartz and metal tables paired with green alligator and burned cypress banquettes will fill the dining room. A post shared by DTB (@dtbnola) on Feb 17, 2017 at 2:25pm PST Schaubhut and chef de cuisine Jacob Hammel are currently developing the Cajun/coastal-influenced menu. Diners can expect shareable Gulf seafood dishes like crawfish boiled chips (seasoned tempura-fried potato slices with lemon marmalade, popcorn crema, and herb salad), crawfish bread, and vegan mushroom “boudin” balls. A post shared by DTB (@dtbnola) on Feb 15, 2017 at 3:07pm PST Barside, beverage director Lu Brow (previously Commander’s Palace Restaurants, Brennan’s) is developing a cocktail lineup that draws on Louisiana ingredients. Some of the drinks Brow plans to serve include the brown butter old fashioned (brown butter washed bourbon, bitters, satsuma, and cherries), the Louisiana cocktail (sassafras infused rye, barrel-aged Peychaud’s bitters, amaro, and pecan oil), and the Fire on the Bayou — Magnolia vodka, Lillet, citrus, and housemade pepper jelly served as a shot alongside a small “pony” beer. Schaubhut told Eater in January that the bar program would also have a strong emphasis on beer and wine. While the official date isn’t set yet, DTB is expected to debut in March . Stay tuned for more updates. Correction: This story has been updated to reflect a name change from DTB Social House to “DTB.” The project is being developed by Carl Schaubhut only and not in partnership with Jean-Pierre Guidry as previously reported.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:35:18.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
