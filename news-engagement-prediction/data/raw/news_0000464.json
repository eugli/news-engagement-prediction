The \nA U.S. Marshals' task force tracked Jennings down in Trenton's South Ward Wednesday night and arrested him without incident, officials said. \nJennings was arrested a day after the shooting in a vehicle and initially given a $1 million bail on the attempted murder charges, First Assistant Mercer County Prosecutor Doris Galuchie said Thursday. \nSince Jennings was arrested in a vehicle, detectives obtained search warrant for it and found three guns and 198 decks of heroin, and charged him separately with possessing the guns and drugs. \n'Street code' dispute led to fatal shooting, prosecutors say \nFor that set of charges, Jennings received a $150,000 bail, Galuchie said. \nBut by the time he was sent to the Mercer County Correction Center after appearing in Mercer County Superior Court, the jail only received Jennings' $150,000 bail. \n\"They had no knowledge of the $1 million bail,\" Galuchie said of the jail. She said it appears the court never sent the higher bail. \"It was a snafu by the court.\" \nJennings posted the $150,000 bail Dec. 5 and was set free, Galuchie said. \nWhen the prosecutor's office figured it out on Jan. 24, they applied for a bench warrant, which a judge assigned, and sent it to the U.S. Marshals' Regional Fugitive Task Force. \nOfficers detained him at about 6:50 p.m. Wednesday on the warrant, and by 3 a.m. Thursday he was back at the county jail, records show. \nKevin Shea may be reached at .
