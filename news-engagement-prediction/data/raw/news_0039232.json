Hussain had the highest bond, $38,720. Beye and Muhammad paid $2,970 each.\nInvestigators plan to get subpoenas for several bank accounts they believe are connected to the investigation.\nAnyone with information about the case can call the anonymous Marietta police tip line at 770-794-6990.", "external_links": ["https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1QxgmbKST1IvJO7INZxMjJnuT2ho", "https://www.galottery.com/en-us/coam.html#tab-coam-overview"], "published": "2017-02-15T23:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T09:15:48.902+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
