What you probably didn&apos;t know is that you get to watch her roll around in the sheets with her boyfriend, played by Austin Nichols, before she meets her brutal demise at the hands of the titular psychopath in Bates Motel . Thumbs up.\n\"I&apos;ve been here before,\" she says, while being drenched in rain at about the 30-second mark in the video above. \"I was here with my boyfriend.\"\nIn addition to that, Nichols tweeted out a bonus trailer where you can see a quick glimpse right at the start, emphasis on the word quick:\nThe Final Season of @InsideBates starts tonight. Join me for a live tweet and a cocktail tonight. pic.twitter.com/5SJZ6HrxQE\n— AUSTIN NICHOLS (@AustinNichols) February 20, 2017 Related Rihanna to Play Iconic Role on Final Season of 'Bates Motel' Check Out Rihanna as Marion Crane in the New 'Bates Motel' Trailer Rihanna, Mindy Kaling, Awkwafina, and More Join 'Ocean's Eight' Cast (UPDATE) Previous reports told us that Rihanna&apos;s multi-episode version of Crane will be much different and more developed that past depictions.\n“It’s tough to be in a situation where you’re in love with a guy, and for whatever reason, he keeps stalling. You still have all this hot sex with him, and he’s saying he loves you, but he’s stalling,\" executive producer Kerry Ehrinsaid said to Entertainment Weekly in January. \"The internal story of that, for a woman, is a really interesting one. We never really got to see that. In Psycho , you just see the outside of that more. It was trying to do a story about a contemporary woman with some edge, with some expectations, who isn’t perfect, who isn’t always perfectly sweet, who is in that situation, but we’re rooting for her to get what she wants.”\nBates Motel just began its fifth and final season. And while it&apos;s unclear if there will be an alternative twist to this particular character, say Marion being a retired MMA fighter who gets the jump on her attacker and pummels him before roundhouse kicking his head through the mirror, dropping a catchphrase, and then driving away while he&apos;s still unconscious wearing his mom&apos;s clothes, you&apos;ll likely soon get a chance to see if Rihanna can live up to the screaming of past Marion Cranes, including Janet Leigh, Anne Heche, and almost certainly some others that were less notable.\nSounds like we&apos;ll just get to see a lot more character growth before the inevitable bloodshed. Guess that&apos;s what happens when you have several episodes, instead of just an hour-and-a-half to tell a story.\nTags: News , Videos , Bates Motel , Psycho , Rihanna", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/InsideBates", "https://twitter.com/AustinNichols/status/833764074823430148", "http://www.refinery29.com/2017/02/142071/rihanna-bates-motel-sex-scene", "http://ew.com/tv/2017/01/31/bates-motel-rihanna-photos-video/", "https://t.co/5SJZ6HrxQE"], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:20:55.131+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
