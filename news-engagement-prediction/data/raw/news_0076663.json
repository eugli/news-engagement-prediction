He induced two quick groundouts and ended the game with a strikeout. \n\"I just kind of went back to what I was doing in 2013,\" Jackson said. \"I just want to have fun out there, keep everything composed and not try to do too much. It feels great. I feel so comfortable out there on the mound. I'm not out there on the mound trying to be somebody that I'm not. I feel like I did that the past couple years. So, I'm pretty excited about it.\" \nSelected by the Rangers in the first round (45th overall) of the 2010 MLB Draft, Jackson strengthened his prospect status as he produced a 2.04 ERA over the 128 innings he completed while being utilized primarily as a starting pitcher for Class A Advanced Myrtle Beach and Double-A Frisco in 2013. But as he moved forward, his command wavered as he allowed himself to be adversely affected by the pressure he felt to reach the big league level. \nJackson experienced short stints in Texas' bullpen both of the past two years, but the struggles he experienced at the big league level and while producing 6.2 walks per nine innings at the Double-A and Triple-A levels last year led the Rangers to go a different direction. In December, the Rangers traded Jackson to the Braves in exchange for Tyrell Jenkins . \n\"I'm back to feeling comfortable,\" Jackson said. \"I'm ready to bring it to Atlanta and show them what I've got.\" Mark Bowman has covered the Braves for MLB.com since 2001.
