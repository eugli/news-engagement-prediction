The \"Formation\" singer, who was announced as one of the music festival's headlining acts in January, officially dropped out on Thursday due to her pregnancy. Instead, she has rescheduled her headlining gig for 2018. WATCH: Pregnant Beyonce and Jay Z Dote on Blue Ivy at NBA All-Star Game: See Her Reaction to the Mascots! \"Following the advice of her doctors to keep a less rigorous schedule in the coming months, Beyoncé has made the decision to forgo performing at the 2017 Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival,\" Coachella announced on Facebook . It continues, \"However, Goldenvoice [the festival producer] and Parkwood Entertainment are pleased to confirm that she will be a headliner at the 2018 festival. Thank you for your understanding.\" Beyoncé and Jay Z announced they were expecting twins earlier this month, shortly before Bey took the stage at the GRAMMYs for a \"Lemonade\" medley. No word yet on who the replacement headliner will be -- or if that artist will be a woman, seeing as Beyoncé was set to be the first female singer to headline in a decade, since Björk in 2007. Despite Beyoncé's cancellation, Coachella will go on as planned, with Radiohead and Kendrick Lamar still headlining the desert festival on April 14-16 and 21-23.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:54:39.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
