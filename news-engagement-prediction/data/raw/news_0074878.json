How it happened | Oscars Best Picture fiasco \nI t meant that La La Land’s producer, Jordan Horowitz, was forced to cut short the team’s acceptance speech and declare the real winner as Moonlight, a budget film starring Naoime Harris and Trevant Rhodes. \nThe embarrassing blunder, which has already been labelled the most dramatic moment in the history of the Academy Awards, resulted in PwC releasing a statement admitting that “the presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope”. \nThe statement said that PwC “deeply regretted” the mistake, which saw the cast and crew of La La Land stripped of its Best Picture award. Watch | How the internet reacted to the Oscars Best Picture mix-up 01:43 \nI t read: “We sincerely apologise to Moonlight, La La Land, Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, and Oscar viewers for the error that was made during the award announcement for Best Picture. \n“The presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope and when discovered, was immediately corrected. \n“We are currently investigating how this could have happened, and deeply regret that this occurred. We appreciate the grace with which the nominees, the Academy, ABC and Jimmy Kimmel handled the situation.” \nHowever, just days before the Oscars, Mr Cullinan released a promotional video boasting of the company’s relationship with the Academy. \n“The reason we were even first asked to take on this role was because of the reputation PwC has in the marketplace for being a firm of integrity, of accuracy and confidentiality and all of those things that are really key to the role we have with the Academy and counting these Ballots,” he said. \n“It’s really symbolic of how we are thought of beyond this role and how our clients think of us, and I think it is something we take very seriously and take a lot of pride in.\" \nA sked if the Academy might ever consider putting the role up for tender, he added: \"As long as our relationship is good and strong and we do a good job, which we always do, the academy has been pleased I think with how we've been involved. \n\"It's such a long term relationship that we know intricately how everything works, the timing of it, the process that we use, and they have absolute trust in what we do. \n\"We hope we're doing this 83 years from now as well.\" \nIn another interview with online website Medium, Mr Cullinan said: “Some people ask us if we are relieved once the last envelope is handed out and the show is concluded, suggesting that we have no further secrets to keep. \n“Some of those include: who got second? Or, how close was it? Those questions we never answer. It doesn’t end with the last envelope. \n“I can say for sure that our view of our role has stayed the same — how critical it is to be accurate and keep it confidential. \n“We check things dozens of times, recounts and double-checks. We’ll have staff go back two and three times to make sure, and then Martha and I will review and recount to ensure there are no differences between what we have and they had. So far, there’s never been a problem.” This is gold. PwC partner Brian Cullinan discusses whether the Oscars job ever goes out to tender.

I really did.” \nBarry Jenkins, director of the actual winner Moonlight, said the error had left him speechless. \n“I’d never seen that happen before. It made a special feeling more special but no in the way I expected. The last 20 minutes of my life have been insane… beyond life changing. \n“Things just happen. The folks from La La Land were so gracious. I can’t imagine being in their position.” Follow Telegraph News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T17:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T12:23:26.589+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
