Haka tells Spy: “After many lunches between Auckland and LA, script revisions, lyrics and song trials, Keisha and I came up with this scenario as a first step towards our other goals. “We believe limitations create art. When you have it all, you don’t work the same. Yes, a $10 million budget would have been nice, but not for this first work. \n“This short film had to capture the tone, the feel, of what I see in future projects.”When Spy asked Haka about Castle-Hughes taking part in such a sexually charged movie, he said: “I needed a woman who could convey a sexual strength and power. “Her character is not subservient to anyone, she is in charge at all times. The really explicit scenes did not involve her.”Castle-Hughes told Spy: “I trust Mika in his sincere approach and reasoning to the sexual content in the film.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T00:02:41.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
