He informed that 236,599 Rakhine Muslims had been repatriated under that agreement until it came to a halt in 2005. \nHe stressed that the constant presence of the huge number of Myanmar nationals in Cox’s Bazar district had created some adverse effects on the overall socio-economic, political, demographic, environmental, and humanitarian and security situation in the district and adjacent districts. \nHe also informed the UN special rapporteur about the initiatives of the government to engage with Myanmar bilaterally through the establishment of border liaison offices and introduction of dialogue on security cooperation. \nAli highlighted the endeavours to foster regional connectivity involving Myanmar through BCIM and BIMSTEC and thus ensure sustainable development in the region. \nHe emphasised the peaceful resolution of the longstanding issue of influx from Myanmar to Bangladesh and urged the international community to take measures for addressing the root causes of the problem.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T04:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T17:42:05.839+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
