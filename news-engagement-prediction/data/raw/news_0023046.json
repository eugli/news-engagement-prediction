There are three choices – chicken, fish and pork porridge. Poached chicken will chilli on the side is perfect to be eaten with the porridge. \nThe porridge is cooked until it is soft and smooth enough for you to drink it. \nThe cook puts the meat in the cooked rice porridge fresh with every order, before serving the piping hot bowl of comfort food. \nIt is perfect for people of all ages. \nI remember how my mum asked for this porridge every day when she was sick. \nThe porridge is perfectly seasoned – for me, there is no need for additional salt or soy sauce. \nAll three varieties taste similar except for the meat factor. \nI prefer more meat in my porridge, but then each bowl is reasonably priced at just RM4.50. \nTo add more protein to my dish, I usually order poached chicken with chilli on the side which adds a kick to the porridge. \nThe tender meat is cooked in soy sauce with lots of garlic and topped with cucumber slices, spring onions and coriander. \nThe chicken is full of flavour and blends perfectly with my porridge. The famous porridge stall in Jalan Sultan Azlan Shah formerly known as Jalan Ipoh comes with fish, chicken or pork. \nThere are also options to add yau char koay or century egg for more texture and flavour. \nWhile many make a quick stop for takeaways, there’s also the option of dining in. \nFor drinks, the stall offers sweet barley with beancurd and red bean soup. \nThe dessert does not disappoint. \nIn fact, I have seen some who come just for the dessert and not the porridge. \nThe stall also sells economy rice noodles and noodles. \nAlso worthy of mention is the friendly people who run the show and the quick service. \nThe stall opens daily except Sundays, public holidays and during Chinese festivals. \nBusiness hours are from 6pm to 11pm on most days.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T03:13:40.961+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
