Getty Images The former Juventus star has flattered to deceive this season according to many pundits, but did score a screamer against Swansea City Manchester United star Paul Pogba scores a direct hit in foot darts \n“And probably Paul will lose this status as the world’s most expensive player which will be a good thing. \n“I think that he has phenomenal conditions but I think the scrutiny on him is hard, is difficult. \n“When he plays very, very well which he does many, many times, people think it is normal from him. \n“Yet when he has a game when he is not so happy and he doesn’t perform so well you guys, pundits and even supporters go strong on him. \n“But that’s the price of being who he is – it is the price of his price. \n“I am pretty sure that next summer some players with only half his quality probably will cost the same money or more. EPA Antoine Griezmann is expected to join Manchester United in the summer \n“So I am waiting for that moment to release him from the scrutiny. \n“But I am really happy with his football and his happiness to play football because the most important thing for him is not to lose that happiness.” \nAs he prepares to face Blackburn Rovers today Pogba would be happier still had he not now hit the woodwork eight times. \nThe 23 year old has eight goals for his club and one for France so far and Mourinho purrs : “We have a few records in the season and this is an amazing one. \n“Imagine the eight posts and it would be an amazing record too so, you know, step by step. Getty Images 7 Jose Mourinho's men sit sixth in the table, 12 points behind leaders Chelsea \n“He is still very, very young but I can see his influence on the team now – yes, I can. \n“I am really happy with what he did, for example, at Leicester and against Watford. \n“People didn’t see him so much in dangerous areas. \n“But he gave us an incredible balance, recovering the ball, starting the building up from the back and was really impressive. \n“And at the top of the pitch he is a guy that can score goals. \n“So still very, very young.
