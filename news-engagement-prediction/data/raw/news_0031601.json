Kevin Durant hugs his mother, Wanda (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 1:22 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 1:22 p.m. ET \nKevin Durant's mother Wanda knows the fans in Oklahoma City are passionate. She sat among them watching her son for eight seasons as he formed a dynamic duo with Russell Westbrook, emerged as a superstar and became a staple in the community. \nEverything changed July 4 when Kevin declared he would join the Warriors, the team that had just eliminated the Thunder in the 2016 Western Conference finals. The All-Star forward returned to OKC for the first time in a Warriors uniform on Saturday, scoring 34 points in 33 minutes as Golden State walked away with a 130-114 win . \nMORE: Durant unimpressed by volume of Thunder crowd \nWanda understood Thunder fans would not give Kevin a warm reception, but she was shocked by the personal attacks she heard from her seat in the lower concourse behind the Warriors' bench at Chesapeake Energy Arena. \n\"I do understand that the fans here loved Kevin, and they never thought that he would leave,” Wanda told USA Today . “Unfortunately he did leave, but he left a legacy here that’s undeniable. And so, for the people to act the way that they did — and I understood the boos. OK, that’s kind of superficial, but the name-calling … It’s the people who make it so personal, and attack his character so viciously, like they know him — (all) because he decided to play somewhere else. \n\"But then, the bold thing is they’re standing in my face. They’re bold enough to call him a snake and a coward. One guy even called him — I can’t even say it – the p-word. In my face.\" \nWanda was also bothered by the \"cupcake\" chants hurled in Kevin's direction, a reference to Westbrook's reaction when Kevin decided to sign with the Warriors. Former Thunder center Kendrick Perkins used to call his teammates \"cupcakes\" when they were being soft on the court. Westbrook shared a photo on Instagram of cupcakes July 4, appearing to take a subtle jab as the news broke. Thunder fans used it as a rallying cry throughout Saturday's game. \nMORE: Durant, Westbrook end up at same OKC restaurant after game \nEven as Wanda witnessed her son become public enemy No. 1 in OKC, she realized why fans expressed such strong feelings. \n\"But I do get it. I don’t want to minimize the pain and the hurt that a lot of fans felt,\" Wanda said. \"They wanted him to stay, and so I understood that. For those people, my heart goes out to them. Some of those people still tell me that we still love him. I wanted him to stay, but I love him. No matter where he goes, I’ll love him because of the person that he was.\" \nDespite Kevin's current chase for a championship with the Warriors and the obvious animosity from the Thunder faithful, Oklahoma City will always hold a special place in the hearts of both Kevin and Wanda. \n\"I can’t say (why he didn’t want to play in Oklahoma City anymore), because there are — this is a family still,\" Wanda said. \"I still look at Oklahoma City, the organization, the place here, I still look at it as part of my family — even though we’ve moved on. I wouldn’t want to do anything or say anything derogatory toward the organization, because I still care for them. But I think he felt that he was — his time was up. He gave it all he could, and it was time for him to move on.\" \nIt's possible one day the Thunder will have Kevin Durant back on the floor to raise his jersey to the rafters as he receives a standing ovation. But it will likely be a long time before that wound begins to heal for many in OKC.
