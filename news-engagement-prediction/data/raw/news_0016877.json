The show's cold open began with Alec Baldwin's Donald Trump sitting at his desk in the oval office asking if his daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared had gone home yet. Trump's handler responded, \"Yes, they don't work on Shabbat.\" To which Baldwin's Trump replied, \" Perfect, when the Jews are away, the goys will play . Send in Steve Bannon.\" skip - An Oval Office desk swap. At which point Steve Bannon , dressed as the Grim Reaper appeared and goaded Trump into calling the Prime Minister of Australia. The call, mocking the real president Trump's reported hang-up on Australian PM Malcom Turnbull, did not go well as the two kicked off the call discussing \"Trump's Muslim ban.\" Baldwin's Trump repeated Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway's much derided false claim that there had been a terrorist massacre in Bowling Green , Kentucky, that led to Barak Obama banning refugees from Iraq. As the sketch continued Bannon asked Trump for his desk back at which point Trump gave Bannon his desk and went to sit at a smaller desk off to the side. The cold open ended with another disasterous, completely fictional phone call to Zimbabwe's leader played by Kenan Thompson. The episode, hosted by actress Kristen Stewart, who accidentily dropped the f-bomb while recounting her own Trump encounter, also included a hilarious sketch in which comedian Melissa McCarthy lampoons Trump Press Secretary Sean Spicer and his relationship with the press. skip - \"I'm here to swallow gum. And I'm here to take names.\" “Before we begin, I know that myself and the press have gotten off to a rocky start,” McCarthy quipped in angry tone. “In a sense, when I say rocky start, I mean it in the sense of Rocky the movie, because I came out here to punch you in the face! And also, I don’t talk so good.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T18:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T13:50:48.795+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
