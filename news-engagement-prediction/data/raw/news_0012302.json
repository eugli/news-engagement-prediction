If they are using private accounts or devices, it would require a warrant to find them and they aren’t violating any law if they stick to opinion.” \nLewis served as a Foreign Service officer with both the State and Commerce departments. \n“Illegal surveillance would lead to a lawsuit against the [agency] that conducted it [and] the workers would win,” Lewis added. “Encryption is a problem in that it can hide communications between two people but can be a handicap if you want to share material widely.” \nSome State Department employees see it as their civil duty to flag any policies or proposals that they believe will be detrimental to their agency’s role, POLITICO said. \n“I think we all have to look within ourselves and say ‘Where is that line that I will not cross?’” one Foreign Service officer said about opposition toTrump's ban, according to POLITICO. \nOne of the most high-profile acts of dissent occurred when Acting Attorney General Sally Yates ordered the Department of Justice’s lawyers not to defend the ban order in court. \nTrump abruptly fired her. \nRecently, news surfaced about a Secret Service agent who last year said in a Facebook post that she would not sacrifice her life for Donald Trump if he became president. \nEmployees of the National Parks Service raised eyebrows when the agency’s Twitter account had a retweet of photos showing crowds at Trump’s and Barack Obama’s inaugurations. \nThe agency removed the retweet and described it as an error. \nBut so-called “unofficial resistance teams” at the park service, EPA and NASA have been apparently using alternative accounts to take jabs at Trump and his policies. \nOne tweet, cited by POLITICO, said: “Can't wait for President Trump to call us FAKE NEWS. You can take our official twitter, but you'll never take our free time!” \nMany of the federal workers turning to under-the-radar means of communicating are using Signal, a smartphone app that can be used to send encrypted messages. \n“It seems Trump is going after people who oppose things that he’s doing, so it makes sense that federal workers would be concerned about making their political ideas known,” said Jonathan Katz, director of the Maryland Cybersecurity Center at the University of Maryland. \n“The [Signal] app is well-designed, it’s secure, it would be difficult to collect widespread information from it,” Katz said to Fox News. “But if [the government] wants to target a specific individual, it could do that.” Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T12:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T10:05:18.393+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
