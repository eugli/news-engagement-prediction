Related Content Even the one comfort in Turnbull's disastrous run is bad news \nIt has really blind-sided bystanders who recall how staunchly Abbott stood by his outspoken frontbencher, even when he was saying some really wack stuff about Muslims. That was until Cory compared homosexuality to bestiality and gave his leader no choice but to sack him. \nBut the closer the bromance, the harder the break-up, and in politics, the greatest enmities occur within parties, not between them. Advertisement \nNonetheless it is odd that Bernardi has singled out Abbott, his brother in all things Queen, country and alpha male sports, as the catalyst for his split from the Liberals. \nIt was, reportedly, a conversation with Abbott that convinced Bernardi he needed to defect to start his own conservative movement , a move he has been coquettishly promising/threatening for the better part of a year.
