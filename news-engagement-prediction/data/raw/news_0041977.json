Kayode Aderanti \nHe explained that the stakeholder meeting on security in schools became necessary, following invasion of schools by kidnappers and subsequent abduction of students, citing the Nigerian Turkish International College and the Lagos state Model College cases as examples. \nHe assured that Police would always be at schools beck and call, by deploying the services of the Central Criminal Registry, CCR, for background checks on prospective employees. \nThe AIG further called on school managements to interface with the nearest police division, by conducting regular drills in preparation for emergencies, as well as participate actively in the Police Community Relations Committee, PCRC and the recently launched Eminent Persons Forum. \nOn the part of government, Aderanti, advised that “security should be made one of the requirements in the issuance of licences to schools”. \nResponding, one of the school’s management staff, Funmi Olorunisola , described the meeting as apt, adding that it also afforded stakeholders opportunity to be abreast with burning issues on kidnapping in particular and security in general.
