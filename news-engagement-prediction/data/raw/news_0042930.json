The five-time NBA All-Star is best remembered for his years with the Sacramento Kings. \nWebber's high school and college legacies, however, were tarnished when he pleaded guilty to criminal contempt in 2002 in connection to the Michigan booster scandal involving Ed Martin, who allegedly gave Webber illicit loans beginning in eighth grade. \nMichigan forfeited victories from Webber's two years in Ann Arbor, and removed its 1992 and 1993 Final Four banners from Crisler Center. The university was barred from associating with Webber until 2013. \nDespite his conviction, Country Day refused to forfeit wins during Webber's career, which included three Michigan High School Athletic Association state championships. The MHSAA said at the time that it had no legal authority to force the school to forfeit games. \n\"I don't regret anything,\" Webber said of his high school and college careers. \"I'm thankful that God has allowed me to be here today.\" \nAlthough a rift remains between Webber and his former college, and also some of his Michigan teammates, he prefers to focus on the positive memories. \nRelated:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T05:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T01:07:44.833+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
