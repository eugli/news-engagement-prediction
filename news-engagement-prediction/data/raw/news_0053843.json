GRIG C. MONTEGRANDE/INQUIRER FILE PHOTO \nPoll watchdog Kontra Daya called for the resignation of Commission on Elections (Comelec) Chair Andres Bautista on Wednesday following reports of another possible data breach. READ: Another Comeleak? Theft probed \nThe group said Comelec needs a “reboot” after a computer containing voters’ information was stolen last month from the Commission’s office in Wao, Lanao del Sur. \nKontra Daya said Bautista has “miserably failed to provide the necessary means to protect voters’ data,” especially after the hacking of the Comelec website and the leaking of voters’ information before the May 2016 elections. ADVERTISEMENT READ: Poll chief liable for ‘Comeleak’ \nThe group also questioned Comelec’s decision to report the incident two weeks after it happened, saying it did not want to disrupt the ongoing voter registration for the October Barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan Elections. \n“We find this hard to believe, but at the same time not surprising given that the 2016 COMELEC data breach (or “Comeleak”) was initially reported by TrendMicro as early as April 6 but it was publicly confirmed by COMELEC only 15 days after,” the group said in a statement. \nThe National Privacy Commission (NPC) earlier said Bautista should take full responsibility for the website hacking, which resulted in the records of the 76 million voters being leaked online. The NPC also said the Comelec chair should face criminal prosecution for what happened.
