If you want to remain completely in the dark until the movie debuts, we advise you to check out one of our other excellent articles. \nWith The Last Jedi 's debut slated for later this year, everyone seems focused on how Luke (Mark Hamill) and Rey (Daisy Ridley) will react to each other when the film finally begins. However, fewer people seem concerned about what Finn (John Boyega) will be up to during the movie. That's a real shame, because it sounds like the former stormtrooper's mission will be vital to the downfall of The First Order. New rumors related to The Last Jedi have just surfaced online, and it seems that Finn will be engaging in some badass undercover work on behalf of The Resistance. \nA new report from Making Star Wars indicates that Finn will engage in some dangerous clandestine activity in The Last Jedi . His mission will send him to a Super Star Destroyer above a mysterious red planet (presumed to be the home base for The First Order) to plant explosives and take down the vessel. all while wearing an officer's uniform. He will be approached by a fellow stormtrooper (possibly played by Tom Hardy ) who will see him and congratulate him for his recent \"promotion\" through the ranks of The First Order -- seemingly unaware that Finn works for The Resistance now. \nAs previously mentioned, it remains unclear whether or not Tom Hardy will be the actor to portray this particular stormtrooper. The sequence feels very reminiscent of Daniel Craig 's Stormtrooper cameo in The Force Awakens , so we wouldn't put it past Rian Johnson to build on that running joke and do yet another celebrity cameo involving a bumbling soldier for The First Order. \nOne of the bigger implications of this rumor is the possibility that Finn's actions during the events of The Force Awakens have not become public knowledge among members of The First Order. This stormtrooper's ignorance could mean that high ranking officials like Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) and Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie) have chosen to keep his defection a secret, or it could also be a humorous indication of how poorly organized The First Order truly is. \nLike I said above, none of this has received definitive confirmation yet. It seems feasible enough to be true, but we will just have to wait and see. \nThe Last Jedi has kept most (if not all) of its plot details held relatively close to the chest at this point, so we may not know for sure until The Last Jedi debuts in theaters on December 15.
