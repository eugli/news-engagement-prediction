By the end of the meeting they had all been taken. (Steve Fischer/CBC)\nOwner Mark Barnes said since that Kanata meeting, 300 people have also called asking for training on how to administer the drug, which blocks or reverses the effects of an opioid overdose.\nHe said the kits were mostly being taken by injection drug users, but now a broad range of people have come in looking for naloxone.\n\"Both users, and parents and friends of opioid users are taking the initiative to prevent [an] overdose, which I think is remarkable\" he said.\nOttawa Public Health also promoting the kits Ottawa Public Health is also promoting the kits, trying to get them into schools, bars, concert venues and homes — anywhere a person might overdose.\nThe health agency has now listed on its website the 80-plus pharmacies in Ottawa where naloxone is available.\nBarnes said every parent with teenage children should have a kit.\nHe said with the added risks of pills being laced with fentanyl, anyone taking counterfeit percocets or other fake pills should never take the drug alone.\nIf out with a group, he said people taking those pills should make sure at least one person does not take any drugs and has a naloxone kit with them.\n\"I think it's the mission of the Ministry (of Health) to have one of these kits in everyone's hands,\" Barnes said.\nAll anyone needs to do to get the kit is take a 15 minute training session at the pharmacy and show an Ontario health card.\nBarnes said he still has a good supply of the free kits, as do other pharmacies around Ottawa.", "external_links": ["https://documents.ottawa.ca/sites/documents.ottawa.ca/files/pharmacy_naloxone_list_en.pdf"], "published": "2017-02-25T04:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T05:53:04.194+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
