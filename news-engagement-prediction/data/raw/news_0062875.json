The EFCC quizzed Dikko on June 16, last year over alleged N42billion fraud. He was not detained due to his alleged ill health. The EFCC also traced how about N2.6billion was withdrawn from NCS’s coffers and remitted into the accounts of some companies floated by a former Assistant Comptroller General of Customs who served under Dikko. EFCC asked Dikko to explain the sources of funds with which he acquired a N2billion mansion at 1, Audu Ogbe Street, Jabi Abuja. Dikko is believed to have refunded about N1,040,000, 000 to the Federal Government. A highly-placed source said: “The operatives of the EFCC have been able to establish that Dikko’s Jabi mansion was funded largely through kickbacks from Customs contractors. “For instance, it was learnt that the N100million used to purchase the land on which the mansion sits was provided by a Customs contractor. Ditto for the first tranche of N650m used in the construction of the gigantic building. “These funds were allegedly paid to Dikko’s personal lawyer by the contractors. The Lawyer in turn transferred the funds to the engineer handling the construction of the building. Both the lawyer and the Engineer allegedly admitted their role, claiming they acted on the instruction of the former CG. “Also, operatives of the Commission are looking into how a former Assistant Comptroller General of Customs under Dikko, got paid over N2.6billion, which were remitted into accounts of companies floated by the officer from the customs coffers.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T02:07:25.622+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
