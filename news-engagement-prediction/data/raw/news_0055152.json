Wolves have lost their last four league games and are now facing up to the very real threat of a fight to avoid relegation. \nThe hosts sought to make a fast start, with Birmingham goalkeeper Tomasz Kuszczak doing well to collect an early cross from Andreas Weimann under pressure from Jon Dadi Bodvarsson. \nKieftenbeld’s opener was a personal disaster for Wolves goalkeeper Carl Ikeme. He dropped a cross from Craig Gardner right at the feet of Kieftenbeld and the Dutchman was able to stab the ball into an empty net from only six yards. It was his first goal for 13 months with his previous strike coming in the 3-0 win against Ipswich in January last year.

A Che Adams cross from the right edge of the area took a slight deflection off Doherty. That took the ball invitingly into the path of the on-rushing Davis whose first-time drive from 16 yards whistled straight past Ikeme for his fourth goal of the season. \nWolves should have reduced the arrears before half-time but the hard-working Bodvarsson was out of luck in front of goal. He met a free-kick from Price with a powerful header from eight yards but his effort flew over the bar. \nBodvarsson was in the thick of the action again when Birmingham were reduced to 10 men in the 53rd minute. He was sent crashing to the ground by a rash challenge from Robinson and the referee, Stephen Martin showed him the red card after consulting with his assistant. \nDespite their reduced manpower, Birmingham could have increased their lead in the 59th minute when Cheick Keita saw his goal-bound shot blocked. \nBirmingham were then indebted to Kuszczak for maintaining their two-goal advantage when he somehow kept out a close-range header from Dicko following Helder Costa’s cross. \nKuszczak was helpless when Costa teed up Dicko a second time. On this occasion he rammed the ball past Kuszczak from six yards before Birmingham stood firm in the face of a late Wolves assault when Doherty lifted an effort over the bar. \nTony Mowbray’s first game in charge of Blackburn Rovers ended in a 1-1 draw at fellow Championship strugglers Burton Albion. A Luke Murphy own goal gave Mowbray’s side the lead after 31 minutes but it was cancelled out 24 minutes later when Marvin Sordell curled in a classy equaliser. \nBurton moved above Wolves as a result of the draw, while Blackburn remain deep in trouble in 23rd position.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T05:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:57:36.994+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
