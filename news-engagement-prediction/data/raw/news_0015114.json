Starr has also started using the hashtag #itsourmedicine to raise awareness of the issue.\nChanges announced last November Veterans Affairs Minister Kent Hehr announced last November that the government would only cover three grams of medical marijuana a day, a sharp cut from the 10 grams covered now. The allowable amount could be greater if a specialist signed off on it.\nBut Starr said rural veterans don't have access to specialists.\n\"Effectively, this cuts off a lot of veterans who are in more rural areas who don't have access to specialists,\" he said.\nMedical marijuana misunderstood? Starr has set up a page on the crowdfunding website GoFundMe and has raised $885 so far for veterans' expenses for the April protest in Ottawa. (Go Fund Me)\nStarr also said there are misunderstood aspects of medical marijuana that may lead some people to believe that 10 grams is more than it really is. For instance,veterans aren't smoking 10 grams of marijuana to get high, he said.\nHe used to take as many as 10 prescriptions multiple times a day to deal with his PTSD, and said it's confusing to him that the government would change access to a drug that has helped him.\n\"All I've ever wanted is to get better,\" said Starr.\n\"I've just wanted to move on with my life. And I've actually found cannabis â€” it's taken me about 10 years to get to where I'm at right now.\"\nWith files from Information Morning Fredericton", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T22:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:28:47.828+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
