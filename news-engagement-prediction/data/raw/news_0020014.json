USA is shaping up to be the deepest American squad since the inaugural Classic in 2006, with manager Jim Leyland calling the shots. \n\"It's a nice opportunity for me,\" Leyland said. \"But this is not a party. We want to win. I can't imagine what that would feel like. I'd love to find out.\" \nThe Americans will need to be great to do it, because they still have not won a World Baseball Classic. Japan took the '06 and '09 titles, and the Dominican Republic won the '13 installment in part because of the brilliant tournament by Classic MVP Robinson Cano , the Seattle Mariners second baseman who will be back on the field as his team attempts to defend its crown. Players to watch on Team Japan Morosi on players to watch on Team Japan in WBC 2017 MLB Network's Jon Paul Morosi looks at the key players to watch for from Team Japan in the upcoming World Baseball Classic \nThat will be a tougher task than ever, though. \nIn addition to the always-tough United States and Japan teams, the D.R. will be challenged by Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Mexico, Cuba, South Korea, the Netherlands, Australia, Canada, Chinese Taipei, Italy, Colombia, Israel and China.

Chinese Taipei will be headed by veteran pitcher and former Major Leaguer Chien-Ming Wang . Fourth time to shine in Classic Six players will take part in their fourth Classic Miguel Cabrera, Carlos Beltran, Yadier Molina, Adrian Gonzalez, Justin Morneau and Jose Reyes will play their fourth World Baseball Classic \nPool B, which will be played at the Tokyo Dome, will feature host Japan, with Astros outfielder Norichika Aoki on the roster, plus Cuba, Australia and China. \nPool C will be set in Marlins Park in Miami and will feature host Team USA in addition to the Dominican Republic, Canada and Colombia. \nThe defending champions should have Cano, plus Manny Machado , Nelson Cruz , Adrian Beltre , Jose Bautista , Johnny Cueto , Starling Marte , Hanley Ramirez and Dellin Betances to contribute to a sterling Dominican roster. \n\"We have the offensive weapons and the starting pitching,\" Dominican Republic manager Moises Alou said. \"Hopefully, we can put together the best bullpen.\" Team Dominican ready for Classic Team Dominican Republic getting ready for Classic Team Dominican Republic's roster is a team of all-stars as they get ready for the 2017 World Baseball Classic \nCanada should have the services of Freddie Freeman , John Axford , Justin Morneau and returning former big leaguers Eric Gagne and Ryan Dempster. And Colombia has a few big league stars expected to play, too, with Julio Teheran and Jose Quintana on initial rosters. \nPool D, at Estadio Jarros de Jalisco in Jalisco, Mexico, will feature host Mexico, plus Puerto Rico, Venezuela and Italy. \nTeam Mexico will be strengthened by scheduled participants such as Adrian Gonzalez , Marco Estrada , Khris Davis , Julio Urias and Yovani Gallardo . Molina ready for fourth Classic Molina representing Puerto Rico for fourth Classic Look back at the three previous World Baseball Classic appearances of Yadier Molina, who will represent Puerto Rico for a fourth time \nPuerto Rico's team should include veteran stars such as Yadier Molina and Carlos Beltran , but also two young players who recently starred in the World Series: Cubs second baseman Javier Baez and Indians shortstop Francisco Lindor . \n\"I'm very excited,\" Lindor said. \"I can't wait. I can't wait to wear my Puerto Rican jersey. I'm proud of my country. I want to represent it everywhere I go. That's the reason I play -- for Puerto Rico, for Cleveland and for my family.\" \nVenezuela is another team to fear, with big league royalty such as Miguel Cabrera , Felix Hernandez , Victor Martinez , Jose Altuve and Carlos Gonzalez expected, among others.
