But he’s over there with General Kelly, who’s been unbelievable at the border,” Trump went on, adding: \n“You see what’s happening at the border. All of a sudden, for the first time, we’re getting gang members out, we’re getting drug lords out. We’re getting really bad dudes out of this country, and at a rate that nobody’s ever seen before, and they’re the bad ones.” \nAnd it’s a military operation, because what has been allowed to come into our country, when you see gang violence, and you’ve read about like never before all of the things, much of that is people that are here illegally, and they’re rough and they’re tough, but they’re not tough like our people. So we’re getting them out.” \nTrump’s statement contrasts with comments by other officials in his administration, who have stressed that deportation will not be pursued en masse or in the style of a military operation. \nA draft memo obtained by the Associated Press earlier this month indicated that the Trump administration was considering mobilizing up to 100,000 National Guard troops to round up immigrants in the country illegally in 11 states — California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oregon, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana. \nThe White House and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to multiple requests for comment from the AP prior to the publication of the story, but after it was published White House spokesman Sean Spicer denied the report , calling it “irresponsible” and saying, ”There is no effort at all to utilise the National Guard to round up unauthorised immigrants.” \nMany of the governors of the states named in the draft memo expressed serious concerns about the potential involvement of the National Guard in immigration enforcement. \nRecent Homeland Security Department memos have laid out other measures to be taken to enforce tighter immigration controls, include hiring 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and 5,000 Customs and Border Protection agents. \nImmigration advocates have criticised proposals to beef up ICE and CBP as an effort to create a “ deportation force .” US Customs and Border Patrol A CBP officer at the Port of Champlain. \nWhile Kelly has insisted his department would not skimp on the quality of people it hires, large-scale hiring efforts have gone awry in the past. \n“This tactic backfired when this happened before,” Mike Vigil, a former chief of international operations for the US Drug Enforcement Administration, told Business Insider on Thursday. “Many unqualified individuals were hired leading to corruption within the Border Patrol and Customs.” \nA cartel enforcer on the US-Mexico border said late last year that US border agents were on cartel payrolls , facilitating the movement of drug shipments from Mexico into Texas. \nThe memos have also called for the expansion of the 287(g) program , which deputizes local law-enforcement officers to take part in federal immigration enforcement. \nThis program has been pursued in the past. “They did away with this policy under Obama because they became overzealous and were rounding up everyone,” Vigil told Business Insider. \nOthers said that outcome would be repeated should 287(g) be implemented.
