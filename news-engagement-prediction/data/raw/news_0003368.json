Close UP NEXT VIDEO England's shocking collapse. Source: Euro Cricket England's shocking collapse \nThe rivals have traded blows throughout the two limited-overs series' but England faltered woefully at the final hurdle losing eight wickets for eight runs in one of T20 cricket's most comprehensive capitulations. \nAt 2-119 chasing 203 England were marginal underdogs, relying on Eoin Morgan (40) and Joe Root (42) to produce something special and seal a 2-1 series win. \nBut just 19 deliveries later they were shaking hands in a daze, having been ruthlessly routed for 127 by Yuzvendra Chalal, whose 6-25 is the third-best return in T20 history. \nMorgan tried to put his side's struggle into words but, like them, came up short. \n\"It hurts, it does. We weren't good enough,\" Morgan said. \n\"I can't put my finger on it it...we haven't produced a batting performance as bad as that in two, two-and-a-half years. Staggering collapse. Image: Sky Sports \n\"We pride ourselves on our batting, it's been our strong suit for some time, and tonight it wasn't anywhere near what it should be. \n\"It's very disappointing. For maybe 60 per cent of the game we were competitive and right in amongst it, but fell away terribly towards the end.\" \nThere were five ducks in the England innings, and just as many ill-judged shots, but Morgan felt the game pivoted on the dismissals of him and Root. \nDespite scoring almost two-thirds of the team's total, the pair fell to successive Chalal deliveries while fully settled at the crease - a vignette that turned the tide emphatically in India's favour.

That allowed India to build up pressure, and we weren't up to it at all,\" he said. \n\"With eight wickets in the shed, a better performance by me or Joe, a 70 or 80, would have made a huge difference. \n\"But I'll take my hat off to India, it was a performance worthy of winning the series.\" \nEngland coach Trevor Bayliss feels his side gave a poor account of themselves on the day but hopes they will be better for the chastening experience. \n\"The way we finished is certainly not an indication of the way we played on this tour - so it's a little bit disappointing from that point of view,\" Bayliss told Sky Sports. \n\"They've got a couple of good spinners, and we're probably not quite world-class players of spin as yet. I'd like to see our guys probably use their feet and go down the wicket as well as trying to sweep.\" Close ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T04:21:52.704+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
