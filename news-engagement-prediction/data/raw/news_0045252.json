Alamy These tips could transform the way you make your fast food order \nQuora users claiming to be ex McDonald’s employees have compiled a handy list of tips. \nFrom ordering round egg with your breakfast, to opting out of salt on your fries, here are 10 useful tricks that could improve your next fast food order… 1. Leave out one burger ingredient Quora 13 \nFussy eaters may actually be enjoying more freshly cooked food at McDonalds. \nAn alleged employee explained that workers are often required to make a burger from fresh if it is ordered without a specific ingredient. 2. Order a round egg Quora 13 \nIf one of your menu items comes with a scrambled egg patty, it could be wise to ask for a round egg instead. \nA high school student claiming to be a McDonald’s employee recommends this because she believes its better quality. \nShe said: “When ordering breakfast, try a round egg on your sandwich. It’s the best egg we have.” 3. Order a Happy Meal Quora \nOne savvy customer suggests that adults opt for the children’s meal deal. \nAsking for a Happy Meal without the toy gets you nuggets and fries at just £2.49.

Get hold of some secret menu items Quora 13 \nOne Quora user outlined how to mix up your regular fast food order by asking for something that’s NOT on the menu. 5. Always ask for a receipt Quora 13 \nAn internet user, who claimed to have worked at a McDonald’s in London for over a year, had another tip. \nHe had a theory that asking your server for a receipt and ordering between 12-2pm and 5-7pm would guarantee the freshest food. \nThe Quora responder alleged that employees are informed to look out for mystery shoppers or “gapbusters” at these times of day. \nHe said: “If you ask for a receipt in that time everyone will be immediately alert that you could be a potential gapbuster and they’ll make sure to serve you the freshet burger and fries and give you priority over everyone else.” Related Stories MAC TO THE FUTURE McDonalds reveals it has been reducing level of 'cancer-causing' chemical in its fries for ten years BURGER ME Porsche blocks McDonalds Drive-Thru for SEVEN HOURS after getting stuck on top of a menu board McGeordie birthday Charlotte Crosby and Chloe Ferry pig out as they splash the cash on huge McDonald's order FLAPPY MEAL Did McDonalds-loving SEAGULLS cause Manchester Victoria station roof collapse?

Ditch the salt 13 \nAnother Quora user who claims to have worked for the fast food giant advised against getting salt on your fries. \nThe process is a bit of a faff, as chips are routinely cooked with the seasoning already on them. \nBy asking for the change, employees will often have to cook up a fresh batch of chips to go with your order.

Order a double cheeseburger instead of a Big Mac Quora 13 \nCost-cutters can achieve the taste of the iconic McDonald’s menu item while saving themselves some pennies. \nOne internet user advises ordering a double cheeseburger with some Big Mac sauce and lettuce to create the tasty flavour. 8. Create a ‘monster burger’ Quora \nWhile this internet user admits that this trick won’t work every time, they advise you try your luck at ordering a ‘monster burger’. \nThis could allow you to swap out your thin Big Mac patties for bigger 1.6oz ones instead. 9. Ask them to ‘uplift’ your hash brown Quora 13 \nYou could unwittingly be getting charged extra for this tasty breakfast item. \nOne Quora responder has suggested that getting an extra hash brown with your meal is cheaper than purchasing one on its own. \nThis is because the popular morning treat costs 70p alone, and just 30p for an ‘uplift’ when bought with a breakfast deal. 10. Get a free hot drink Quora \nAlthough McDonald’s used to give a re-fill on their hot drinks, the fast food chain no longer offer this service. \nTheir official website explains: “We do not offer any drink refills in our UK restaurants… \n“In 2006 we took the decision to replace the filter coffee machines in our restaurants with new machines which serve Rainforest Alliance full bean coffee freshly ground every time.” \nDespite this, customers can bag a free drink if they get hold of a coffee loyalty card. \nAfter purchasing six cups of freshly ground McCafé coffee, you won’t have to fork out for the seventh.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T18:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T13:49:10.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
