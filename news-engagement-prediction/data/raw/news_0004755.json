Demecillo   \nCEBU, Philippines - After he arrives from an official trip in Japan, Cebu City Mayor Tomas Osmeña said he will close the Banco de Oro Magallanes branch by the third week of February. \nIn a phone interview, Osmeña said the city government will not renew the business permit of the branch, thereby asking them to temporarily close pending the investigation for alleged tax fraud. \n\"After I come back from Japan, we intend to close the BDO branch in Magallanes,\" the mayor said. \nWith this, Osmeña asked those who have bank accounts in the Magallanes branch to make \"adjustments\" as early as now to avoid inconvenience. \nThe FREEMAN tried to contact with BDO Magallanes branch manager Joseph Lao but he was in an area meeting the whole day yesterday with the bosses of the bank, according to one of his staff who asked not to be named. \n\"BDO has annual profit of P80 billion, this is adding insult to injury. The city cannot prosper with taxpayers like this. A janitor in city hall pays P5,000 in income taxes. And BDO Magallanes pays P2,000 in business taxes. It is cheaper if we pay them P2,000 a year and move out and stay out from the city. Maka-save pa ta'g kwarta,\" Osmeña said.   \nThe mayor said he is announcing the closure of the bank ahead of time so that the public will not be affected by the closure. \nThe mayor will be in Japan for an official trip from February 8 to February 13. \nThe city government has already issued two show cause notices asking the BDO branch to explain why the city government should not close the business establishment. \n\"While you were processing the renewal of business permit for the BDO-Magallanes Branch and other BDO branches, we provided you with a checklist of additional documentary requirements. Your company opted not to submit the required documents and provided several justifications in your letter dated 17 January 2017,\" the notice read. \nHowever, BDO insisted that the city government has no basis revoking their business permits since no court issued a decision that the bank committed tax fraud. \nAccording to the City Legal Office, some of the requirements in the renewal and approval of the business permits that were not complied were: total deposits for checking, savings and other accounts for 2014 to 2016; branch income statement of 2015 and 2016; branch balance sheet of 2015 and 2016; branch budget 2016 and pro-forma 2017; interest income; and loans, past due items. \nOn January 4, the mayor filed a case against BDO Magallanes branch for allegedly under-declaring and falsifying its declaration of gross sales of only P400,000 in the renewal of business permit to the City Treasurer's Office last year. \nOsmeña said the alleged \"deliberate and malicious\" act of under-declaring and falsifying its gross sales in its business permit is sufficient ground for its immediate revocation and warrant the closure of the business. \n\"To all these big people, we want to make clear to them that tax evasion is a crime,\" he said. \nOsmeña said he is also warning all the 26 branches of BDO in the city since the city is withholding their business permits. \n\"They (BDO branches) are all in the same level. The final decision has not been made but we do not have to cancel their business permits because they have no permits to do business,\" he said, adding that the city government will also be evaluating all their applications. \nIn the bank's annual report, Osmeña said the BDO has total deposits of P1.7 trillion, the net interest income for last year is P57 billion, non-interest income of P31 billion, net profit of P25 billion, and customer loans of P1.279 trillion. \nIn a separate interview, City Legal Officer Joseph Bernaldez said establishments that do not have an approved or renewed business permits should not operate. \n\"The implication there is if you don't have a business permit or if your business permit is not renewed, you're not supposed to operate your business. You are supposed to discontinue operating your business. If they will operate a business permit or without a renewed business permit, they will be violating the law,\" he said.
