Picture: Peter Clark. Central Coast Central Coast commuters patiently wait for Liberal election promise of continuous mobile phone reception Clare Graham, 23, 2017 10:27am\nIt was an election promise by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull that won over many Coasties – continuous mobile phone reception and free Wi-Fi for commuters battling the long daily train trip to Sydney.\nBut the $12 million project will not be happening any time soon with the difficult mountainous terrain between­ Woy Woy and Hornsby expected to slow progress.\nThe Coalition Government has already met with mobile network operators and relevant government departments to get the ball rolling as thousands of “bored” and “frustrated” commuters are forced to endure tedious connectivity on the rails.\nUp to 30,000 commuters would benefit from the continuous in-train mobile phone coverage from Wyong to Hornsby and free Wi-Fi at all stations in between­.\n“We’ve already scoped many of the challenges of this project, which commuters know all too well because­ they see it out their carriage window every day,” Robertson federal Liberal MP Lucy Wicks said.\n“They include the picturesque but difficult topography, with mountainous terrain, river crossings and no less than seven tunnels – which will require a carefully designed mobile network solution to address.\n“There’s also co-ordination of access to land and infrastructure, and scheduling access to tracks to undertake scoping work.”\nmedia_camera Lucy Wicks speaking with commuters Natarsha Bertram and Kylie Edwards.\nA formal tender process is expected to wrap up by the end of the year and will be followed by detailed design work and construction.\nAs a former commuter, Mrs Wicks said she understood how valuable the project would be in making work time more productive, enhancing leisure time and helping people stay connected with their family and friends.\n“For commuters sitting on services like the packed 7.05am from Gosford to the city, we are delivering a new, innovative commitment to help make life easier,” she said.\nWoy Woy mother-of-five, Kylie Edwards, has been commuting to Sydney on and off for close to three decades and finds the current mobile reception “frustrating and annoying”.\nMs Edwards spends up to 13 hours on the train every week and welcomes the promised improvements to the “archaic” network­.\n“This is going to be a huge positive for commuters,” the 49-year-old said.\n“It would be great to see it sooner rather than later.\n“I’ve just come back from Tanzania where in every airport and train station — even in the daggy little ferry terminal in Dar es Salaam — we had Wi-Fi with the locals and the chickens.\n“It seems very archaic that here in Australia we have everything at our fingertips and cutting-edge technology, yet we don’t have Wi-Fi on our trains and at stations.”\nmedia_camera Commuter Kylie Edwards is looking forward to having complete mobile coverage on her daily commute once the $12 million project is up and running. Have your say\nLauren Alcorn, Green Point\n“It’s been a constant annoyance having my mobile reception drop in and out. I’ve been commuting for 10 years and waiting for this for a long time.”\nRebecca Ollikainen, Terrigal\n“I’ve been commuting for a few years. The journey can get quite boring with no phone reception.”\nVictoria Bowden, Wamberal\n“It would be great to get my TAFE work done on the train. I would be so much more productive.”\nmedia_camera Shane Blackman of Umina Beach media_camera Victoria Bowden of Wamberal\nShane Blackman, Umina Beach\n“It would be great to do more web browsing and [live stream] thing like Netflix and Spotify. Every train should have it really.”\nHenrique Bordin, Yattalunga\n“It would be great. I work in software development so at the moment I work on the train when I can. I would be a lot more productive.”", "external_links": ["http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/chronicle/ap/latest/assets/img/news-plus.svg", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fcentral-coast%2Fnews-story%2Fc0c20cb3221d6005bf6b6382a3e57236", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/d2e8b84926ffaca12b163fc17a8378d3?width=650", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Long%20way%20down%20the%20track&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fcentral-coast%2Fnews-story%2Fc0c20cb3221d6005bf6b6382a3e57236", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/spp-api/v1/template?path=components.header.header&exclude-css=false&exclude-js=false&t_product=DailyTelegraph&t_domain=dailytelegraph.com.au&device-channel=desktop&is_front_page=0&show_idaas_login_placeholder=1&v2=1&is_local_news_section=1", "http://www.homeimprovementpages.com.au/find_local_tradies", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/aba650223479dad06ef3607be37aaf1a?width=1024", "https://s2.wp.com/_static/??-eJytjcEKAjEMRH/IblgU1z2I31K6wbY0aW1Sl/17C64XD56EgQzDmwysxQR2qS0oELseDeu2nyHKAX4BhsK9WsWBAn9gl1mRFdQj9cozFGBcxeVabDOEWjMoUkm9J+AylcydF/BoF6ywBNHd/+WtZZs2DU6MoK3Ovwe+033qRtfxNM3jfJzOl/gC4F5rlQ==", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-metro/templates/components/header/dist/header.css?m=1484889074h", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/54854c0d901b63df76f8d3dc9a1f6d12?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/da69de7bd9cd4aec24922f59b2da372d?width=316", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=135086289853833&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fcentral-coast%2Fnews-story%2Fc0c20cb3221d6005bf6b6382a3e57236&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fcentral-coast%2Fnews-story%2Fc0c20cb3221d6005bf6b6382a3e57236", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/resource/networksales/exoduscampaigns/campaigns.json?t_product=DailyTelegraph&t_template=s3/networksales-loader/index&td_domain=dailytelegraph.com.au&td_pagetype=articlepage_v2&esi=true&td_channel=desktop&td_section=newslocal/central-coast", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/06bafdab2e8104bef75d17a7d18d2b09?width=316", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/networksales/loader/latest/assets/js/exodus_loader-client.js"], "published": "2017-02-22T15:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T11:15:41.163+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
