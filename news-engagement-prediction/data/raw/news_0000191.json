FACEBOOK \nDavid Bradford had been released on bail over a slew of domestic violence related assault charges. \nTeresa was killed by her estranged husband David Bradford in an apparent murder-suicide on the Gold Coast. Her children found their bodies in her Pimpama home early on Tuesday morning. \n﻿ READ MORE: * 'We caught her like a football' ﻿ \nJust two weeks earlier, David Bradford had been released on bail over a slew of domestic violence related assault charges. \n\"When I heard the news I messaged her to see if she was OK, but I had a feeling it was her,\" friend Rebecca Degraaf said. \nDegraaf had only known Teresa Bradford for a few weeks, but said they quickly bonded over their many shared circumstances. \n\"We have a lot in common, we're both single mums, both have four kids, we have similar interests,\" Degraaf said. \nThe pair first met when Bradford went to buy school uniforms. Degraaf said she dropped the uniforms around to her house that night, and they ended up having a long chat. \n\"She said, 'I don't know what to do, I'm terrified basically and on my own',\" Degraaf said. \nDegraaf offered to help and said when she visited again on January 25 with donations gathered from the community of school uniforms, clothes, food and money for the family, Bradford seemed more upbeat. \n\"She was a lot happier the second time around, because she felt like someone was listening,\" Degraaf said. \nBradford was studying nursing at Griffith University, but according to Degraaf was \"a little fearful\" her back injuries sustained in a domestic violence incident in 2016 would prevent her from practicing as a nurse. \nDegraaf said Bradford was keen to continue her studies, and had gone to the university to discuss what support would be available to her, including potential bursaries for text books. \n\"She was trying to protect [her children] from what was going on at home and provide for them, trying to get nursing done so she could provide a good life for them,\" Degraad said. \n\"She was really trying to hold it together for them.\" \nDegraaf and another friend, Debra Napper, said she had been determined to move elsewhere so her estranged husband couldn't find her. \n\"She was trying to leave this house and find somewhere else to live,\" Napper said. \n\"She told me that. She was ready to pack up and move.\" \nDegraaf said Bradford needed help moving because of her health issues, which proved more difficult than she imagined. \n\"I'd been going through a range of options. She tried to get help, I tried to get her help - it was so easy for him to find her too,\" Degraaf said. \nNapper said she was \"very disappointed\" with how the system had failed to prevent the tragedy from happening. \n\"You would think being in a domestic violence relationship that somebody would have helped her move out quicker,\" she said. - The Age", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T11:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T06:21:23.763+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
