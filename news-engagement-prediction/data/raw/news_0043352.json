He also has called for a temporary ban on people entering the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority countries. \nHip-hop mogul Russell Simmons headlined the event. He said the Muslim community was being used as a scapegoat, but that “diversity will prevail.” \nIn Oregon, hundreds of people demonstrated on Sunday in front of the Oregon State Capitol to voice their support for immigration rights. \nYesica Navarro spoke about growing up as an immigrant. She said she came to the U.S. as a child with her family, and they managed to succeed despite the odds, The Statesman Journal reported. \n“We love this country, and we want to be accepted. This is our home,” Navarro said. \nThe crowd, which organizers said neared 1,000, cheered and clapped as cars honked their horns, the newspaper said. The rally was part of a national effort called Immigrants’ March Presidents Day 2017. \nIn Dallas on Saturday, police estimated about 1,700 people rallied downtown in a peaceful show of support for immigrants and refugees. \nA North Texas newspaper reported that religious and civic leaders were among those protesting President Donald Trump’s immigration policies. \nSome marchers carried U.S. flags or banners from other nations and chanted: “Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here.” No arrests were made. \nAbout a dozen counter-protesters stood nearby in support of Trump. \n(©2017 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.
