He took to Twitter to provide rebuttals to some of the more frequent criticisms he's heard from his decision. \n\"Respect the office\" Ok birther theory guy â Chris Long (@JOEL9ONE) February 17, 2017 \n\"Stick to football\" you don't look like a state senator yourself there bud. â Chris Long (@JOEL9ONE) February 17, 2017 \n\"I hope they cut you\" I'm a free agent. \nAs pointed out by the Washington Post , the Patriots' website suggested Long, a 31-year-old defensive end, \"likely\" won't be back in Foxborough next season. \n\"You just wanna be a cool lib\" As a football player, liberals thought I was a living, breathing piece of steak before I agreed with them. â Chris Long (@JOEL9ONE) February 17, 2017 \n\"You hate the troops\" The secondary focus of my foundation (out of two causes) is veteran support.
