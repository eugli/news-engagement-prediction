(Photo: Kirby Lee, USA TODAY Sports) \nHOUSTON – Radio row in the days leading up to Super Bowl LI, like always, has featured a who’s who of football stars from the past and present. \nUSA TODAY Sports surveyed six former players from various eras to learn what they like and don’t like about today’s game, a rule they’d want to change and whether they’d play now, knowing more about health issues. \nThey are all Pro Bowlers. Four are Super Bowl champs. One is Hall of Famer. The group was split evenly between offense and defense. \nThe panel included: \nBlaine Bishop: Former Oilers, Titans and Eagles safety, 1993-2002; Bob Golic: Former Patriots, Browns and Raiders defensive tackle, 1979-92; Mike Haynes: Hall of Famer, former Patriots and Raiders cornerback, 1976-89; Shaun O’Hara: Former Browns and Giants guard/center, 2000-10; Michael Robinson: Former 49ers and Seahawks fullback, 2006-13; Reggie Wayne: Former Colts wide receiver, 2001-14. Legacy lost: Should Titans return ‘Oilers’ to Houston, site of Super Bowl LI? \nWhat do you love about today’s game? \nHaynes: It’s action-packed. A lot of passes, a lot of big plays. I like that. I think that’s really great. I also love that it’s a safer game, and they’re working really hard to make it safer. \nBishop: The team camaraderie that you build, kind of like a brotherhood. Everybody has a role and you have the sacrifice. We were all great players in college. But you have to relish your role and have you’re guys’ back and do your job. Really, that equates to being a professional. That’s never changed. It’s an attribute that you actually can’t teach unless you play, and I’m not going to say football, but sports in general. \nGolic: That people are still playing football. That it’s still the game, to a certain extent, the game that we loved back in the day. It’s obviously changed a little bit with the hitting and some of the rules. \nO’Hara: It allows players to have fun. There’s times where you see things on social media where you say, “Wow, that’s great. That’s great you got to share that cause.” There’s so many great things that go on that were left uncovered or unsaid or people didn’t see (when I played). \nRobinson: The competition. Love the competition. Love the soft skills that football teaches you. I played quarterback (for a while up until college). To be able to look every man in the eye and have them believe in you? That’s a skill. Stuff that you learn in the classroom and be able to go out there and perform it? That’s a skill. To be able take the philosophy from your coach and be able to pump it and inject it into a locker room? That’s a skill. That’s what I love most about this game.

It’s getting a little softer, man. Even though I was a receiver and played on offense, I look at some of the calls today and I’m like, “That’s defenseless?” (The defense) is at a disadvantage. They really are. You don’t know how to hit a guy these days, you know what I mean? As a receiver, you’re like, “Thanks?” You look at a lot of these receivers now, they’ll probably play a long time, as long as they can take care of (their) body. It’s to the point now where I feel like a lot of these careers (of the receivers) will be extended. \nHaynes: Some of the things I dislike are also some of the things I like, you know? The officiating, it’s not 100%. And I think that’s what makes the game also a good game. I hit you, and one guy calls it pass interference. Another guys says, “That’s football.” I’m talking the officials. So as a player, I have to figure out, “Which guy are you? What can I get away with? It’s not black and white.” \nBishop: There are bigger, stronger, faster athletes, but I just don’t think they’re disciplined. I don’t think they’re coached up. I just think it’s just a game of great athletes out there running around now, who really don’t study and care about the game. It’s all for the money. There was a passion there that I had, that most guys had in my era that just loved the game. They probably would have played for free. I probably would have. And today’s new millennial athlete, it just doesn’t work that way. They learn everything on video and everything else. It’s kind of like certain things you assume that they know, little nuances of the game, they really don’t know. \nGolic: I hate the fact that nowadays, the collective bargaining agreement basically said you can only have so many days of full contact practices. And we went in for 3 ½ weeks and it was all, until people were falling down, we would go full pads, full contact all the time. Of course, that’s just bitterness and envy jumping out of me now. \nThe focus on controlling the violence. They tell you how to hit, where to hit. I understand some of the things like no spearing. We weren’t allowed to do that back in the time either. But now every time you come near a quarterback, if your hand even touches his helmet, they’re hitting you with a penalty. \nO’Hara: I think one of the challenges that is tough now is you can get in trouble without ever getting out of bed. With social media now, with your phones and everything you have now, everybody has access to you. As a player it’s so hard right now to not be distracted, because distractions are coming at you from every angle. That to me is probably the toughest things the players and teams are facing. There’s not a lot that’s sacred. You used to go in the locker room and it’s like, “What is said (in here) stays in here.” Now, you never know. Everybody’s a reporter. Everything is out there. So that’s a challenge. \nI think the other thing too is it’s a different game now. One of the things I liked about the old school football players is that they genuinely disliked each other. It made for good theater. Now everybody is buddies, all friends on everything, and the jersey swap after the game has kind of become the big thing. You kind of lose that animosity that made game day great. Fifteen years ago, the Patriots were the dynasty no one saw coming \nWhat is one rule change you’d like to see? \nWayne: I’d make a lot of them. Targeting to the head. I mean obviously, that’s tough. They can try and launch and try to hit you in the chest area but I know as a receiver, I know when you’re there, I’m gonna duck. And all of a sudden you hit me in my head. I get it. It’s a tough sport and we know the history of concussions and all that stuff. (Expletive), that’s what we signed up for. \nBishop: I’m trying to figure out which one I want to go with. Being a defensive back, that pass interference is not a spot foul. It should just be a 15-yard penalty. … The reason why I say that now is because if you barely touch a guy – back in the day, you could touch a guy down the field, and when I was playing you could have a little bit of contact and still not call pass interference. Some guy can run in the back of you, you can be looking at the ball and everything and they could still call pass interference. You’ve got to be looking at the ball. OK, well, I’m looking at the ball and I cut his path off. I have the right to the ball just as much as he does, but the way the rules are set up, now is everything’s for the offense because they want more points. But I don’t think that now justifies having a spot foul. Because you can just throw the ball up and a guy can get contact easily, to me, and you can call that pass interference. \nAnother rule that I wish we’d change – I want the referees to be able to pass an obstacle course, physicals and times to justify, because I think they’re getting the wrong angles and not being in the right positions because I don’t think they’re in shape enough to actually be in the right position to make an appropriate call. \nGolic: Nobody can hit the nose tackle. Nobody over 200 pounds. Centers must be the size of kickers. That’d be a good one. \nO’Hara: If I could change one thing I’d move the Pro Bowl back to Hawaii and I’d make it after the Super Bowl. I think the whole spirit of the Pro Bowl was a reward for the players, a reward for a great season. And to not have some of the best players in the Pro Bowl because they’re playing the Super Bowl, to me, is wrong. If you got 5-7 guys who make the Pro Bowl, and to go to the Super Bowl and win it, and you go to the Pro Bowl after you just won the Super Bowl, it’s probably the best week ever. To not have that is just a shame. \nAnd if people wanted to make it more competitive, I wouldn’t pay the losing team. You wanna see guys play hard in the fourth quarter, if you know you have to cut a check for all the flights and hotels? \nRobinson: We do have a lot rules. I get it, it’s all about protection. With the advent of spread offenses and how that’s starting to infiltrate our game – and it’s all on the college level, it all starts with job security there with coaches because they have to win now and score points. At the end of the day we’re hurting quarterbacks, the most important position. \nWhen I was playing flag, especially in my younger days, as the quarterback I had to go into a huddle, had to look every man in the eye, and tell him the play. They don’t do that anymore. Some quarterbacks never had to. If I had to change something, and I have some stuff I’m going to be talking to the NFL about, they need to go and reinvest back into the kid, back into the community, and I think that’ll help this whole dynamic.
