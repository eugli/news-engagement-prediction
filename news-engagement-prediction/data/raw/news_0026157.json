GoFundMe: Irvine Fraser Memorial Fund (Note: CBC does not endorse and is not responsible for the content of external links.) \nA pair of Winnipeg Transit drivers say they no longer feel safe behind the wheel after a deadly attack left one of their own dead on the job. Irvine Fraser, 58, died after being attacked in the early-morning hours of Tuesday. (Facebook) \n\"Now I'm to the point of, 'put me in a cage.' I don't want to see money, I don't want to see nothing,\" longtime driver Nelson Giesbrecht said. \"Let me drive my bus.\" \nA 58-year-old Winnipeg Transit driver, Irvine Fraser, died Tuesday after he was attacked on the University of Manitoba's campus. A police canine unit helped track down and arrest a 22-year-old man on the nearby frozen Red River. The man remains in custody but police haven't released details about what charges he is facing. \nBus driver dies after stabbing at University of Manitoba \nGiesbrecht, who has served 19 years as a Winnipeg Transit driver, said his colleague's death makes him fear for his own safety. \n\"There's no reason why this should happen,\" Giesbrecht said. \"He was always happy. He was always in a good mood. He would bend over backward for you. He was a good guy. \n\"I don't think he was the type of guy who would care about a bus fare if somebody said, 'Oh, I need a ride.'\" 'My fellow brother was murdered for doing his job' 1:08 \nJody Prokipchuk, another Winnipeg Transit driver, said she also wants to see changes to buses to make her job safer. \nPolice have said Fraser was stabbed but haven't confirmed a weapon or whether the incident happened on or off the bus. \nBlood-stained snow could be seen next to a transit bus parked beyond a taped-off area of Dafoe Road West on Tuesday. 'Death of our brother' \nDave Wardrop, the city's chief transportation officer, said this is the first case he knows of where a Winnipeg Transit driver died on the job under violent circumstances. A police officer peers beneath a Winnipeg Transit bus at Dafoe Road West and Gillson Street after the attack. (Jeff Stapleton/CBC) \nWhile the death might be a first, assaults happen all the time on transit buses, said the international Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU). \n\"Most are the result of a fare dispute, but an alarming number happen just because someone wants to do violence to a bus driver,\" ATU international president Larry Hanley said in a statement. \n\"ATU demands that transit agencies and government officials bring the same sense of regret that they will display in the public mourning of this tragic, unnecessary death of our brother, to the ongoing discussion about preventing these attacks from occurring.\" Time for shields? \nProkipchuk, who used to ride the late-night bus home with Fraser after work, said she likes the idea of putting shields around drivers. Winnipeg Coun. Brian Mayes said it might be time to take another look at installing shields on transit buses to keep drivers safe. (CBC) \n\"I would [also] like to have my driver's window be a release to get out in case of any emergency,\" she said. \"It's a solid window â€” you can't get out.\" \nWinnipeg Coun. Brian Mayes agreed, saying it's time to revisit the possibility of installing shields. \n\"If I were a driver, I'd probably be talking about shields. That's fair enough. But it's not like we missed it before. We have talked about it before and there wasn't support from the union. Maybe that will change,\" Mayes said. \nMayes first raised the issue of driver safety in 2011, when he called on the city to put special constables on public transit. Coun. Matt Allard had a motion approved in 2015 that put undercover Winnipeg police officers on buses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T07:29:37.957+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
