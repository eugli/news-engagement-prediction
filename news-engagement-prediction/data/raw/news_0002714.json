It undermines the strengths our diversity brings. \n“Anti-Semitism causes worry in our Jewish communities which must be confronted.” Boy covered in curry and man called 'baby killer' by stranger \nRacist attacks on Manchester’s Jewish community include a schoolboy being covered in curry and a man being called a ‘baby killer’ by a complete stranger. \nThe Community Security Trust (CST) report outlines numerous hate-fuelled crimes, with innocent people berated or attacked by strangers in the street. \nAccording to the report, a Jewish woman and her three children were walking home from a synagogue when a man made a ‘Heil Hitler’ salute at them in March. \nIn May, a Jewish man at a synagogue was told by a man: “I am going to f stab you.” \nThe same month, 16 gravestones were vandalised at a Jewish cemetery and a stone was thrown through a synagogue window.

The Jew will probably want to get off the bus because he probably has not paid. \n“Oh we are going past a dirty stinking Jewish area.” \nIn June, a victim received a text saying: “You stupid Jew, go back home.” \nLater the same month, a traffic warden told a Jewish man, who had parked illegally: “You Jews are all the same, they think they can get away with anything.” \nIn July, two teenagers walked past a Jewish school, approached a Jewish boy and poured curry over him. \nThe same month, eight youths approached a Jewish boy, shouted ‘Dirty Jew’ at him, before assaulting him. \nLater in July, a Jewish girl was playing with friends in the street when three white youths shouted: “I will call Hitler. We will call Hitler to shoot you.” \nIn August, a group of youths shouted ‘Jewish b s’ at guards at a Jewish school. \nLater the same month a man, walking down the street in broad daylight with his wife, was called a ‘f Jew’.
