He’s a fair way behind the highest-paid boss, Ken MacKenzie of Amcor, who took home $20.92m although that figure was inflated by the payout of long-term incentives. No 2 on the list was Macquarie Bank’s Nicholas Moore, who earned $16.5m.\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Australia Post CEO Ahmed Fahour’s $4.4m salary and $1.2m bonus would put him 43rd on the Australian Financial Review’s salary survey in 2015, which ranked the 300 highest-paid CEOs of ASX-listed companies.

While we don’t have the average pay for an Australia Post worker, we can compare Fahour’s pay to average earnings figures by industry from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\n\nCompared with the average Australian salary by industry, Fahour’s pay varies between 43 times as much as employees in the mining industry, to 163 times as much as employees in the accommodation and food services sector:\n\nchart1 The ratio for Fahour’s own industry – transport, postal and warehousing – is 73.5 times the average earnings.\n\nOther articles have estimated Fahour’s pay is 119 times as much as a postal worker on a salary of $47,000 .\n\nAnother survey of CEO pay by the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors has tracked the average fixed CEO pay (this being their basic salary, so payment without equity, profit share and other remuneration) for ASX100 companies over time.\n\nchart 2 Based on these figures, there has been a flattening and then decline in CEO pay since the global financial crisis, which means the ratio of CEO pay to average salary has likewise declined:\n\nchart 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T11:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T08:35:45.568+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
