The agreement states that he cannot violate any laws during the six month diversion period. After the six month diversion, the charges will be dismissed. However if he breaks the agreement, the city will prosecute for the drug charge. \nThe suspension was Bragg's second on the season. He was previously suspended for one game in December 2016 after being charged with misdemeanor battery . However the charge was dismissed, and Bragg's accuser was subsequently charged. \nThe 6-foot-10 forward is averaging 6.1 points, 4.8 rebounds and 15 minutes per game this season for the 20-3 Jayhawks. Kansas has lost two of its last four games, however, and faces its in-state rival Kansas State on Monday night in a short turnaround after Saturday's loss to Iowa State .
