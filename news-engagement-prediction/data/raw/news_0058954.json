Her devoted dad, Haydn, says: \"If I could take the operation on myself, I would, of course\" (Photo: Charlie Rees) \n\"I desperately want, with all of my heart, for people to know that they need a biopsy they have a similar problem and it doesn’t go away,\" Charlie said. \n\"I want dentists to know that too. I was so upset that this had happened.\" \nShe added that she still remembers how \"frightened\" she was to hear her diagnosis. \n“I had a sort of 'out of body' experience,\" she said. \n\"You know that everything is about to change.” \nLast November, Charlie underwent 12-hour surgery. \nForty per cent of her tongue was removed and reconstructed, using a muscle and blood supply from her forearm, and skin grafts from her stomach. \nFortunately, the operation went well, In another video, taken shortly after the procedure, she says groggily: \"I can talk, I really can!\" Ahead of her surgery, Charlie bravely vowed: \"You'll never shut me up\" (Photo: Handout) \nThe thought of not being able to talk and communicate had terrified the mum, whose career had been in the world of communication. \nShe had built her identity on using her voice through speech and singing. \nCharlie, who lives in Newbury, Berkshire, with her son, Tyler, told Mirror Online she had to teach herself how to speak properly again after her surgery. \n\"The operation went well, but they didn't find my glands clear of cancer,\" she said, describing how around four of her 35-40 glands were infected. \nCharlie was put on a feeding tube at Reading's Royal Berkshire Hospital so she didn't \"have to negotiate\" food going through her mouth. \n\"The level of care has been something else,\" she said. The mum-of-one now faces an anxious wait to find out if her treatment has been successful (Photo: Handout) \nShe was also forced to undergo a gruelling course of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in a bid to get rid of her cancer. \nWhile she was in hospital, Charlie said her son was cared for by her parents, who flew over from their home in France to support them. \n\"Tyler and I are a unit,\" she said. \"He has never met his dad. He’s been on the journey with me and is coping really, really well. \n\"His school have been amazing as well.\" \nRecently, Charlie, who works as the head of creative for a local business, finally reached the end of her course of treatment. \nShe now faces an anxious wait to find out if it has been successful.

They embrace all of your family as well.” \nShe also continues to upload videos of her experience with tongue cancer on YouTube in a bid to raise awareness of the disease. \nCharlie has dedicated Facebook , Twitter , Instagram and JustGiving pages to highlight the importance of early diagnosis of mouth cancer. \nMacmillan Cancer Support provides a range of services to people affected by cancer including a telephone support line, website with information and advice, financial support and peer-to-peer support through an online community. \nFor more information visit macmillan.org.uk or call 0808 808 00 00.
