Artwork by Aaron Bills Most Athletic \nAs evidenced by him winning the Nike+ Football Ratings championship in July of 2015, Detroit Cass Tech five-star wide receiver Donovan Peoples-Jones is a freak of an athlete. A rising junior at the time, Peoples-Jones clocked a 4.42 in the 40-yard dash and popped off a 42.4-inch vertical jump earning him a 149.49 overall score. He's already enrolled at Michigan and has as good a chance as any prospect in the class to play in the fall. Most Likely To Succeed (On & Off Field) \nON THE FIELD: Despite not being Michigan's highest-rated commit in the 2017 class, Toledo (Ohio) Central Catholic four-star strongside defensive end James Hudson could end up being more special than anyone else. Listed at 271 pounds, Hudson is closer to 300 pounds now but still manages to bounce around the field like a gazelle. His build, proportions, overall size and athleticism for such a big young man makes him look like a lock to play in the NFL in the future. \nOFF THE FIELD: While the NFL could certainly be in Peoples-Jones' future as well, if it's not he's on track to be just fine. Peoples-Jones plans to go into the medical field and cites Michigan's academics as the deal sealer when it came to his recruitment. The son of Chicago-area surgeon Eddie Jones, Donovan has the been bitten by the medicine bug as well and should be very successful in whatever area he goes into. Future Team Captain \nAs the younger brother of former Michigan linebacker James Ross III, Orchard Lake (Mich.) St. Mary's four-star outside linebacker Joshua Ross understands what it takes to be successful at U-M. Despite being the youngest commit in the class, Ross carries himself in a very mature manner and has the work ethic to be a future captain at Michigan. He also comes from a winning pedigree having brought home three state championships in a row at St. Mary's. All of those things add up to Ross being a great future leader on defense and overall. Biggest Steal \nDetroit Martin Luther King four-star cornerback Ambry Thomas was billed as a Michigan State lean throughout much of his prep career but Michigan's staff built the relationships necessary to procure his commitment in December. With positions in the secondary up for grabs at U-M, Thomas, the No. 146 overall prospect in the country, has a chance to see the field in the fall making the theft even more valuable. Most Underrated \nDespite winning nearly every award possible in the state of Connecticut, including Gatorade Player of the Year, Sandy Hook (Conn.) Newtown three-star Ben Mason is modestly listed as the No. 35 inside linebacker in the country and is even looking up at five other players in the state rankings. After stuffing the stat sheet for four years on both sides of the ball in high school, Mason is already on campus at Michigan as an early-enrolled freshman. Best Position Group Wide Receivers from L to R: Donovan Peoples-Jones, Tarik Black, Nico Collins, Brad Hawkins, Oliver Martin \nWith No. 1 wide receiver and five-star Donovan Peoples-Jones and a quartet of four-stars in Tarik Black , Nico Collins , who was once a five-star prospect, Brad Hawkins , and Oliver Martin officially in the fold for Michigan, no other position group can match the star power of the pass catchers. Linebacker and defensive line are close, but from top to bottom the receivers take the cake. Hardest Hitter \nBefore tearing his ACL after just one game in 2016, Paramus (N.J.) Paramus Catholic's Drew Singleton was a heat-seeking missile of an outside linebacker known for chasing down plays from sideline to sideline. Combining that speed with his 220-pound frame allowed him to arrive at ball carriers with bad intentions. Before the injury, Singleton was chasing a fifth star and had a great shot at picking it up. His knee has healed up nicely and if he can return to his original form by this fall, he'll push for playing time among young, unproven linebackers at U-M. Rookie Star \nIt's rare to find 300-pounders with the combination of explosiveness, strength and agility that Leesburg (Ga.) Lee County defensive tackle Aubrey Solomon has but that's why he's a five-star prospect and considered the No. 31 overall player nationally. It'll likely be impossible to keep him off of the field in 2017 and, despite not being quite as highly ranked as 2016's top prospect Rashan Gary, the two have similar skill sets and could be a dangerous combo as young defensive linemen for Michigan in the fall. Best Recruiter \nNo one was as visible, persistent or active in recruiting other players to Michigan as Saint Joseph (Mich.) High four-star strongside defensive end Corey Malone-Hatcher was. Whether he was pinning tweets persuading Detroit safety Jaylen Kelly-Powell to come to Michigan, dropping recruiting videos of U-M's top targets, or creating and pushing hashtags like #DPJtoAA, Malone-Hatcher was putting in work to bring other blue chippers to Ann Arbor with him. It paid off in more cases than it didn't and made him extremely popular among the Michigan fan base. Fastest Player \nThere's a reason Peoples-Jones is Michigan's top-ranked commit in Michigan's 2017 class â€” he's a freak athlete. His 4.42 electronically-timed 40-yard dash from almost two years ago remains the fastest, verified 40 time by any of the members of his class. \nLos Lunas (N.M.) High four-star running back O'maury Samuels and Ambry Thomas would both give DPJ a run for his money in a race but, for now, the crown belongs to the receiver from Detroit. Best Interview \nWhen Darien (Conn.) High three-star offensive tackle Andrew Stueber committed to Michigan in June 2016 he agreed, without hesitation, to doing a FaceTime interview with TheWolverine.com and nailed it. In November, we stopped by his high school and put him in front of a camera for more than eight minutes and he took things to another level. It's easy to tell that he's an intelligent young man and he fielded questions with ease about his future at Michigan, other recruits and much more during the video interview. He does better in that setting than some professional athletes who get paid millions of dollars to do it. Best Hair \nSeveral Michigan commits were considered for this award but it has to go to the young man with a mane of flowing, Polynesian locks. Berrien Springs (Mich.) High three-star lineman Phillip Paea has a glorious head of Tongan salad and shows no signs of stopping the growth. His hair, along with a full sleeve of tribal tats and an ability to perform the haka, complete the image of being a big-time lineman from the islands. See for yourself: Paea's flow glistening in the sunlight during a visit to Ann Arbor this past fall. Best Name \nUnlike the \"Best Hair\" award, this one wasn't close. Alexandria (Va.) Episcopal four-star weakside defensive end Luiji Vilain has an amazing name for an overly athletic pass rusher. The 6-4, 240-pounder could start terrorizing quarterbacks this fall and will certainly be a big-time contributor before his time at Michigan is over. Most Talkative \nThis award doesn't necessarily go to the commit who speaks the most, but rather the most reliable talker. In today's day and age of recruiting, prospects can get a little sick of the process and become harder and harder to get in touch with as National Signing Day approaches. Not so with Sugarcreek (Ohio) Garaway Local three-star offensive tackle Joel Honigford . Whenever he was asked a question, you could bank on it being answered within minutes via text or direct message. If a phone call was requested, he'd be talking within the hour. Kids like Honigford make the job of a recruiting analyst very easy and the efforts to be that way are much appreciated. Funniest \nBy all accounts, Bradenton (Fla.) IMG Academy four-star center Cesar Ruiz is a funny dude. He likes to smile and be entertaining during interviews and he gave Michigan fans a small taste of that during Signing of the Stars. Other commits in the class, teammates of his at IMG Academy and several members of the media all agree that Ruiz is an intelligent and humorous young man. He has the perfect personality to be the leader of an offensive line, something he should develop into during his time at U-M. \n--- ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T02:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T11:08:08.336+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
