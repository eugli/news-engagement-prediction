He responded, the report states, by saying \"The inertial navigation system, but it is good.\" \nWhen the maintenance controller tried to find what exactly was wrong, Maj Sareen replied: \"Don't worry about it, the jet is good.\" \nThe report also found the weather on the day Maj Sareen died had a \"major impact\" by forcing him to use his standby flight instruments. \n\"If the weather conditions had been clear,\" the report's author said, \"I believe Maj Sareen would have been able to adequately deal with the system problems/failure modes of the INS (inertial navigation system) and would have been able to avoid impact into the ground.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T07:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T05:57:49.602+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
