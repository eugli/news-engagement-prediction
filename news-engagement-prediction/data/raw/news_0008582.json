"highlightText": "", "language": "english", "persons": [], "text": "HBOS banker Lynden Scourfield and his cronies 'financially raped' small businesses to fund lavish holidays and sex parties\nA corrupt HBOS banker has been locked up for 11 years after he and his cronies 'financially raped' small businesses to fund lavish holidays and sex parties in one of Britain's biggest ever frauds.\nLynden Scourfield, 54, a senior director of HBOS, 'sold his soul' to David Mills by forcing firms that needed to borrow cash to use his friend's crooked consultancy firm.\nHe 'sold his soul for sex, for luxury trips ... for bling and for swag', a judge said.\nBehaving like the 'Mafia', they would then use threats and extortion to seize control of the businesses, plundering bank accounts and pocketing massive new loans granted in their name.\nScourfield, who boasted of being the 'grand wizard', enjoyed luxury holidays, trips on Mills' superyacht and sex with porn stars in return for his help. The scam cost scores of hard-working middle-class business owners not only their livelihoods, but also their family homes, pensions, savings and in one case even her marriage.\nJurors were told the fraud was worth £245million, but victims and police sources said the cost to small firms ruined by the scam was up to £1billion.\nScourfield was jailed for 11 years and three months while Mills, 60, was given 15 years at Southwark Crown Court today.\nMichael Bancroft, 73, was jailed for 10 years, Mark Dobson, 56, for four-and-a-half years, and John Cartwright, 72, for three-and-a-half years for their various roles in the fraud between 2003 and 2007.\nMills's wife Alison, 51, also played a major role in the corruption and was sentenced to three and a half years.\nThere was standing room only in the courtroom, which was packed with victims and their supporters, and applause and cheers from the public gallery when the sentences were passed.\nSentencing, Judge Martin Beddoe said the case involved an 'utterly corrupt senior bank manager letting rapaciously greedy people get their hands on vast amounts of bank money and their tentacles into ordinary and honest businesses'.\nCall girl: Escort Suzie Best, pictured left and right, was a porn star who performed for Scourfield at sex parties he organised\nLuxury: Powder Monkey, the £2million superyacht owned by David and Alison Mills\n'Letting them rip apart those businesses without a thought for the lives and livelihoods of those affected in order to satisfy their rapacious desire for money and the trappings of wealth,' he added.\nScourfield had not shown a 'shred of remorse' for ruining the lives of the employers and employees of those companies, he continued.\n'People haven't just lost money but in some instances their homes, family and friends,' he added.\n'People who could have expected to be comfortable in retirement were left cheated, defeated and penniless.'\nThe judge described Mills as 'a thoroughly corrupt and devious man, adept at exploiting the weaknesses of others'.\n'He is the devil to who you (Scourfield) sold your soul in exchange for sex, for luxury trips with or without your wife, for bling and for swag,' he added.\nFraudsters: Michael Bancroft, David Mills and Lynden Scourfield on holiday in Barbados for Mills's wife Alison's birthday\nScheme: David Mills and Lynden Scoufield, who orchestrated a £245m loan scam entertained themselves with 'luxurious foreign travel', 'lavish spending', and 'sex parties'\nOn tour: The trio of fraudsters on holiday in Thailand, enjoying another trip while small firms pay for their jetset lifestyle\nSome of the victims lost their companies, livelihoods and even their homes as a result of the scam.\nPaul and Nikki Turner, from Cambridge, were ignored for years when they tried to report what was going on after their publishing company, Zenith, was run into the ground in the scam.\n'They defrauded us, denied for 10 years that the fraud had happened, ignored the debt from the fraud and tried to evict us 22 times in order to cover up the fraud,' Mrs Turner said outside court.\n'It's a huge success for us that the trial has gone on.'\nShe added: 'The other victims have gone through terrible things, they have gone through the loss of businesses and lost homes.\n'Other people lost everything, including marriages broken up, because of this.'\nWhen the wealthy gang of four men and a woman were convicted for the five-year fraud on Monday, Thames Valley Police commissioner Anthony Stansfeld described it as a 'shocking' and 'disturbing' crime.\nCriminal couple: Pictured is David Mills (left) and his wife Alison Mills (right) who appeared at Southwark Crown Court\nWolves: Pictured is Mark Dobson (left), John Cartwright (centre) and Michael Bancroft (right)\nOne of three rooms used to store hundreds of boxes of evidence accumulated during a police operation, as a group of corrupt financiers who carried out a £245 million loans scam and squandered the profits on high-end prostitutes and luxury holidays have been jailed\nHe said: 'That a fraud of this size could have taken place either displays complicity or incompetence, a lack of corporate governance, complacency, and an absence of proper safeguards.'\nThe case bears similarities to the 2013 film The Wolf of Wall Street, in which Leonardo DiCaprio plays a crooked broker who made millions as part of a stock market fraud – using his ill-gotten millions on lavish parties, cars, prostitutes and drugs.\nHBOS, the holding company behind Halifax and the Bank of Scotland, finally discovered Scourfield's unsanctioned loans in 2007. Just 18 months later the failing bank had to be taken over by Lloyds and required a £20.5billion taxpayer-funded bailout to cover toxic debts caused by excessive lending.\nThe Mail has seen numerous letters from the bank over the following years in which senior officials repeatedly denied it contributed to the failure of the companies that were fleeced, prompting accusations that it attempted to 'cover up' the scandal.\nVictim Joanne Dove, who lost her business, home and marriage through the fraud, said: 'It was financial rape... I lost everything, my reputation, all our money, all our pension schemes.' It also emerged that:\nThe fraud carried on unhampered for four years because of a 'fundamental flaw' in the bank's checking system. Former Tory Minister Sir James Paice said the head of HBOS 'flatly denied' the lender had done anything wrong after Scourfield was finally sacked. Sir Victor Blank, the chairman of Lloyds TSB at the time of the HBOS takeover, was warned of a 'huge fraud' by one of the victims, but an associate wrote back to say it would 'not be appropriate to respond'. Lloyds now faces a huge compensation claim from those defrauded. Scourfield, who worked on impaired assets in the Reading branch of HBOS, was the 'goose laying golden eggs' for Mills and his consultancy firm Quayside, Southwark Crown Court was told.\nScourfield enjoyed 'sexual entertainment... on a fairly frequent basis' in return for his part in the scam. Wads of £4,000 cash to be spent on prostitutes were delivered to a central London flat where he entertained the women.\nNicknamed 'funny money', it was kept in a drawer along with a stash of Viagra. Suzie Best, a £250-an-hour escort and former adult TV star described the fat cat banker as a 'short, balding Danny DeVito lookalike' after one session at the rented flat in 2005.\nShe said the man with 'grey, brushed-back hair' asked her to go to the bedroom with him, but she 'didn't think he could get an erection at any stage'.\nIll-gotten gains: Bancroft's Range Rover parked up at his luxurious farmhouse in York\nCountry house: Police took images of Bancroft's farm house in York, used as background material during the trial\nMs Best, who costs £300-an-hour, called Scourfield and his friends the 'posh t**t bankers' and met them regularly at a rented London flat.\nSuzie would perform sex acts on some of the men and also performed in 'girl-on-girl shows' for their pleasure.\nScourfield also suffered from 'suffered from premature ejaculation, liked to undress girls and liked girls to wear suspenders and mini-dresses', the court heard.\nHis favourite escort Suzie also offers 'verbal and physical domination' for clients who like spanking and humiliation.\nEnvelopes filled with wads of cash were delivered Scourfield at a flat in Portman Square.\nIf he was not there they were left in the 'blue drawer' which was where Bancroft kept a stash of viagra.\nCartwright told the man dropping off the cash it was 'funny money for Scourfield to pay for girls'.\nAbroad: This huge, white-walled villa was Bancroft's home in Portugal, paid for from the funds they gained from their illegal scheme\nPalace: A luxury bedroom on board the yacht which is owned by banker David Mills\nAnother call girl, a porn star, kept a diary detailing a lurid lesbian show she and three other women performed for Mills and Scourfield in October 2005. A later entry read: 'Chinese meal. Then drinks at flat and quick shag. Easy £1,500.'\nScourfield, who earned £88,600 a year, was also given free rein to travel across the world and splash out with an Amex card at Mills' expense. He spent more than £57,000 on jewellery, clothes, and hotels during 'boys' jollies' in Germany and the US.\nMills took him on several holidays, including a £4,000 seven-day cruise in Florida paid for on an Amex card from a struggling business.\nScourfield and Mills took their wives for a six-star cruise from Nice to St Tropez, staying in a royal suite on the three-day trip.\nThe Quayside consultants also enjoyed a luxury life from the money they stole. Mills and his wife Alison lived in a detached six-bedroom home, with swimming pool, tennis court and gym, in the affluent town of Chorleywood, Hertfordshire.\nThey also owned a 100ft £2million luxury superyacht called Powder Monkey, which was moored in the Mediterranean. Accomplice Michael Bancroft lives in a six-bedroom farmhouse in Warwickshire and had a villa in the Algarve.\nHe was employed by Quayside despite previously using £645,000 of shareholders' cash at another company to pay for his lingerie model mistress, work on his family home and golf holidays.\nPool: And as well as the luxury yacht, Mills had a huge home with a swimming pool out back called Toddenham House, in Gloucestershire\nCruising: David Mills owned this black Range Rover, one of the many luxury cars that the gang managed to buy with the money they conned from others\nScourfield got away with his 'deliberate, systematic and sustained' scam for so long because of a 'fundamental flaw' in the banking system, the court heard.\nHe would log unapproved loans in a bank system which would be sent to the company head office in Edinburgh. But the system was open to abuse because anyone with an appropriate level of authority could change limits on the system.\nPictured is a luxury yacht owned by David Mills\nFor three years between 2004 and 2007 there were also no audits at the Reading branch where Scourfield worked, the court heard. It was not until later that HBOS director Tom Angus became 'increasingly concerned' and arranged for a preliminary review that found 'many gaps in formal sanctioning'.\nScourfield was suspended for gross misconduct the following month, after which Quayside's involvement in the scam was discovered.\nTwo further internal investigations and a third by Deloitte found 'serious negligence and possible improper conduct'. But the Mail has seen documents showing that the bank repeatedly denied that any wrongdoing either in its lending or its use of Quayside as a consultancy long after it knew of serious problems.\nAndrew Reade, who was left £250,000 out of pocket after his company Keenets was pillaged by Quayside, wrote to Victor Blank, the then chairman of Lloyds TSB, at the time of its takeover of HBOS in 2008 outlining in extensive detail the scale of the consultancy's 'huge fraud'.\nHe attached a dossier describing how many companies had suffered because of what was described as a 'huge fraud' involving Scourfield and Quayside.\nBut the next day he received a letter from the banker's executive assistant saying it would be 'not appropriate' to respond to the issues raised.\nGaudy: The trio were hardly subtle with their wealth and David Mills had a personalised number plate on his black Mercedes\nLiving large: This was a quad bike in the garage at York Farm, David Mills's country home\nSir Victor, a former business ambassador for Gordon Brown, was chairman of Lloyds in 2008 when the credit crunch hit.\nSir James, a former Tory minister who campaigned for bank collapse victims as an MP, said: 'The head of HBOS flatly denied to me that the bank had done anything wrong in a face-to-face meeting, despite all the evidence we now know to the contrary.\n'I am pleased that justice has been done but very sorry it has taken so long. Clearly HBOS is going to have to recompense the very hard working men and woman who have suffered so badly.'\nMark Dobson, who was also a manager at HBOS, Mills and Michael Bancroft, were convicted on counts including bribery, fraud and money-laundering.\nAlison Mills and John Cartwright were also convicted for their parts in the conspiracy. Another defendant, Jonathan Cohen, was acquitted. Scourfield pleaded guilty at an earlier trial last year. They will all be sentenced later this week.\nA Lloyds spokesman said the bank assisted police throughout the probe.\nCouple suffered '13 years of hell' but never gave up on tireless campaign to expose fraudsters By TOM KELLY FOR THE DAILY MAIL\nJoanne Dove, who lost £15 million, her home and business from the HBOS bankers\nNikki and Paul Turner suffered '13 years of hell' after falling victim to the HBOS fraudsters.\nAfter their business was destroyed in the scandal, the couple led a tireless campaign to expose the crime – despite repeated denials of wrongdoing by the bank and threats to evict them from their home.\nTheir ordeal began in 2003, when they took out a £160,000 business loan from HBOS to fulfil their dream of starting a music publisher called Zenith Cafe.\nIn 2004 they were introduced to senior HBOS director Lynden Scourfield, who forced them to use crooked Quayside Corporate Services.\nQuayside charged tens of thousands pounds in fees, but repeatedly gave incorrect advice. It was only after Zenith Cafe was forced out of business that the Turners discovered many other victims of the fraud.\nFinding themselves broke, and with their accounts frozen, they were forced to sell their jewellery to finance investigations into the scam.\nThey wrote repeatedly to the bank, regulators, police and MPs, but said the banking group not only repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, but also attempted to repossess the Turners' home through 22 eviction hearings.\nMr Turner said: 'It was a complete cover-up. The bank repeatedly attempted to mislead us, the other victims, our MPs and other authorities.' Mrs Turner added: 'What happened at HBOS Reading was fraud on an industrial scale.'\nThe Turners said they managed to keep hold of their five-bedroom home in Cambridge after the courts accepted that there was potential misconduct by the bank and refused to allow it to repossess the property.\nBut the couple estimate the scandal cost them £11million.\nUnlike the Turners, Joanne Dove really did lose everything – her marriage, £1.2million business, savings, pension and home. The award-winning businesswoman is now a single mother of four living in social housing, so hard-up she could scarcely afford to pay the travel costs of attending court to see her tormenters go to jail.\nShe said: 'I can only liken my experience of dealing with HBOS appointed executives to how I would imagine dealing with the Mafia would be.\n'It was financial rape... I lost everything, my reputation, all our money, all our pension schemes. My children lost their father in their lives and the idyllic childhood they previously had. Our family was devastated... they robbed me of my life's work.'\nMiss Dove ran the eco-nappy company Cotton Bottoms, which by 2003 had grown so rapidly that she needed a £400,000 loan to expand.\nLynden Scourfield approved the loan, but insisted she hire Michael Bancroft from QCS as a non-executive director on the board.\nThe crooks then systematically bled the company dry, eventually taking it away from Miss Dove amid threats as while she was expecting her fourth child.\nBancroft even locked her in a room as he demanded controlling shares in the company.\nShe said: 'I felt like a hostage. It was like having a huge parasite implanted in the guts of the business.'\nShe said Bancroft put her at loggerheads with her husband, a co-director of the company, by secretly offering him a deal to buy out the firm and give him a new position.\nIn desperation, she was forced to sell the business to a competitor at a sixth of its value, leaving her ruined.\nA 'goose laying golden eggs', a textiles tycoon and a businessman who preyed on small businesses: Profiles of the corrupt financiers and their cronies who orchestrated the scam\nAnthony Joseph for MailOnline\nDebauched HBOS banker Lynden Scourfield, 54, built up a £245million of toxic debt as he pumped cash into failing businesses for David Mills to cream off.\nScourfield was the 'goose who was laying golden eggs' and Mills rewarded him with luxurious trips around the world and viagra-fuelled encounters with high-class hookers who were repulsed by his bulging gut.\nOne sex worker, known by the alias Suzie Best, described the fat cat banker as a 'short, balding Danny Devito lookalike' after a session at a rented Portman Square flat in 2005.\nAnother sex worker, dubbed FR, kept a diary detailing a lurid girl-on-girl show she and three other hookers performed for Mills, Bancroft, and Scourfield in October 2005.\nDebauched HBOS banker Lynden Scourfield (pictured in Russia), 54, built up a £245million of toxic debt as he pumped cash into failing businesses for David Mills to cream off\nScourfield, whose HBOS salary averaged £88,600 a year between 2003-2007, was given free reign to travel across the world and splash out with an AMEX card at Mills' expense.\nHe spent more than £57,000 on jewellery, clothes, and hotels during 'jollies' in Dusseldorf, Germany, and the US.\nIn February 2004 he and Mills enjoyed a lavish holiday in Florida and Miami as Mills paid for a £4,000 seven-day cruise on an AMEX card from a struggling business.\nA month later the Scourfield and Mill took their wives for a three-day all inclusive six-star cruise from Nice to St Tropez, staying in the ship's two-bedroom Royal Suite.\nMills and Scourfield went to the PGA golf show in Orlando a year later.\nScourfield also used the AMEX card to pay for stays in the five-star Westbury Hotel in Bond Street, Mayfair, and meals at Wilton's Oyster Bar in St James's, central London.\nAlison Mills made sure to keep him sweet and flew him out to Barbados for her 40th birthday party with the Bancrofts.

Mills, his wife Alison, 52, Michael Bancroft, 73, and John Cartwright, 72 - ransacked the businesses' accounts by charging exorbitant fees and expenses\nSenior Impaired Asset [IA] manager Lynden Scourfield, 54, exploited 'systemic and personnel weaknesses' within HBOS to make millions with crooked businessman David Mills, 60, and his associates.\nThey targeted 200 small businesses that were struggling to repay HBOS loans between 2003-2007.\nThe bank's IA division took control of the failing clients in order to steady the ship and protect their loans, or to recover what funds they could through asset stripping.\nScourfield threatened to stop the flow of cash to companies unless they hired 'turnaround consultants' from Mills' firm Quayside Corporate Services [QCS] for up to £30,000 a month each.\nOnce they agreed, Scourfield authorised more than £500million of loans to the high-risk clients from his HBOS office in Reading, regardless of their ability to repay.\nThe QCS 'consultants' - Mills, his wife Alison, 52, Michael Bancroft, 73, and John Cartwright, 72 - ransacked the businesses' accounts by charging exorbitant fees and expenses.\nWhen the firms went into administration, Mills seized what assets were left and transferred them to his sham companies The Sandstone Organisation and Knightingale Investments.\nThe QCS gang spent the profits on millions or pounds' worth of property across Europe, birthday bashes in Thailand and Barbados, trips to Ascot, and a yacht.\nScourfield was rewarded with at least £1million by way of luxury holidays, lavish gifts, and orgies with high-class escorts.\nHis IA colleague Mark Dobson, 56, helped to divert funds from two high-risk clients to Mills' bogus businesses in return for £30,000 and lavish hospitality.\nAccountant Jonathan Cohen, 57, was said to have organised Scourfield and Mills' tax affairs to conceal the scam while his troubled firm Brett Adams raked in loans from HBOS's IA division. He was cleared of any involvement by the jury today.\nRUMBLED: HOW THE CORPORATE BANDIT WAS CAUGHT OUT\nHBOS had a 'second pair of eyes' principle, which meant all credit applications Scourfield authorised should have been looked over by his manager and senior director, Paul Burnett.\nThe Managing Director of Credit Risk Hugh McMillan should have been alerted to the biggest deals.\nBut neither man realised Scourfield was funnelling tens of millions into Mills' criminal enterprise - despite the fact that escalating debt from his loans was recorded and submitted to Mr Burnett.\nIt was only when senior HBOS director Tom Angus was appointed to oversee IA in January 2006 that the bank began to wake up to his flagrant corruption.\nWithin six months of his new role, Mr Angus asked to see authorisations for Scourfield's credit applications.\nMark Dobson, 56, helped to divert funds from two high-risk clients to Mills' bogus businesses in return for £30,000 and lavish hospitality.\nHe had to chase the fraudster repeatedly before receiving a suspicious bundle of documents that contained 'no evidence of appropriate sanctioning' in January 2007.\nA month later HBOS carried out a review of 38 struggling businesses that had received irregular loans from IA and together owed the bank £375million.\nThe conclusion was damning: the bank stood to lose up to £288million from companies that had engaged QCS under Scourfield's supervision.\nMr Angus confronted the conman with the findings at the bank's Bishopsgate office on 8 March 2007 - but within hours he went off sick with 'work-related stress' and never returned.\nHBOS suspended Scourfield for gross misconduct and he resigned in April 2007.\nThe former banking giant carried out two further investigations but neither one uncovered the 'true nature' of Scourfield's corrupt relationship with Mills.\nProsecutor Brian O'Neill QC said: 'Some other employees of the Bank do not emerge well from the investigation, most particularly Paul Burnett, who was Scourfield's immediate line manager.\n'There is little doubt that his apparent lack of oversight was partly responsible for Scourfield's ability to act in the way that he did and for as long as he did.'\nHe continued: 'Had Burnett and others paid closer attention to the crib sheet figures, Scourfield's activities may have been identified sooner..\n'Burnett lost his position at the Bank as a result of his failures as a manager.'\nJurors were told 'systems and processes undoubtedly contributed to Scourfield's ability to behave dishonestly' as he began 'exploiting systemic and personnel weaknesses which he knew to exist'.\nBut Mr O'Neill insisted there is 'no evidence' Mr Burnett or any other HBOS employees were complicit in the conspiracy, and said the bank wasn't 'knowingly turning a blind eye' to the con.\nTHE FINANCIAL CRASH\nHBOS, once the UK's biggest mortgage lender, suffered a devastating collapse during the credit crunch - and taxpayers were left to foot the £20.5billion bill.\nThe banking giant was formed by the 2001 merger of Halifax and The Bank of Scotland and loaned £435billion within seven years as it pursued an aggressive expansion plan.\nBut it lost £10.8billion in 2008 as profits plunged by 70 per cent when the credit crunch hit.\nGordon Brown's Labour government quickly issued a £20.5billion bailout package to fix HBOS's massive funding gap and avoid a 'banking meltdown'.\nThe Banking Standards Commission later slammed HBOS bosses for 'catastrophic failings' and a 'colossal failure of management'.\nFormer CEO James Crosby, the 'architect' of HBOS's failed strategy, forfeited the knighthood he was granted for 'services to the finance industry' after leaving the bank for a senior FSA role in 2006.\nMr Crosby, thought to draw more than £400,000 a year from his HBOS pension, said he was 'deeply sorry' for the disaster.\nIn 2012 HBOS senior executive Peter Cummings was fined £500,000 and banned from banking for life by the FSA for his part in the bank's near-collapse.\nMr Cummings retired in 2009 with a £352,000 a year pension after making his name by lending to high-profile clients including Top Shop founder Philip Green.\nLloyds Bank acquired HBOS in January 2009 as part of the rescue package.\nAmid the chaos, Lloyds instructed Deloitte to investigate Scourfield's activity after the Financial Services Authority (now the Financial Conduct Authority) issued a requirement notice.\nThe criminal investigation didn't begin until after the report, dubbed Project Windsor, was completed in 2010.\nTHE VICTIMS\nThe 2010 report revealed that of the £250million written off by HBOS's IA division, £245million related to customers under Scourfield's management.\nNearly all of them had engaged QCS's 'consultancy services'.\nBusinesses that fell prey to the criminal plot include golf equipment firm Seoul Nassau, fishing tackle company Sharpe's Holdings, aviation group Corporate Jet Services (who owned Club 328 and Euromanx), textile business Magenta, restaurant and nightclub operator the Mezzanine Group, and Remnant Media, a company setup to buy porn mags including Asian Babes.\nHBOS began legal action against some of the clients, including couple Paul and Nikki Turner, who ran Cambridge-based music publisher Zenith before it was destroyed by Scourfield's scam.\nThe bank took the Turners to court more than 15 times in an unsuccessful attempt to evict them after Scourfield devastated their business.\nOxfordshire farmer Justin Riggs, 57, said his livelihood was 'annihilated' when Scourfield authorised a £375,000 loan and advised him to sell land and chicken coops in 2004.\nThe farmer was forced to remortgage his house when his loan rose by £7,000 after he had paid £231,000 in interest and fees.\nMr Riggs' plight was discussed in parliament in 2009 as MP Ed Vaizey noted: 'There is a pattern in the way that Mr Scourfield engaged numerous people.\n'He has taken businesses and loaded them with loans, charges and consultancy fees. It's now up to HBOS to come to the table.'\nTHE INVESTIGATION\nThe six-year investigation, dubbed Operation Hornet, was 'the most complex and far-reaching' fraud case in Thames Valley Police's history, involving 120 officers.", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-02T17:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T05:26:39.142+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
