(This, unfortunately, is not true for your living room, which we discovered while watching the first trailer last December.) \nBut a new sneak peek, above, has revealed a bit more. The preview, a prologue titled “Last Supper” and which came during Wednesday’s episode of the FX series Legion , showed things going normal and according to plan on the Covenant, a colonization ship headed for a remote planet where the crew will build a new human settlement. While characters played by James Franco — who we learn is the captain — and Billy Crudup are in awe of their view, Danny McBride has another take: “I don’t know what you’re talking about. It kinda spooks me out — a big old sea of nothing.” Nothing? Well, not exactly. Spooky? Well, that’s one word for what’s to come. \nMichael Fassbender’s android Walter is advising Katherine Waterston’s Daniels on her vitamins and hydration prior to her cryosleep. After the captain, who’s feeling queasy, goes to lie down, a party breaks out. While the crew, all couples, enjoy some food and fun prior to their long sleep, one of the women appears to be choking. With a hard smack to her back, Walter saves the day. For now, anyway, because that was surely some major foreshadowing. \nBefore heading off to their cryosleep, Daniels delivers a toast. “It’s the first-ever large-scale colonization mission to come this far into our galaxy. We’re making history,” she says in part. “I just want to say I couldn’t pick a better bunch of jerks to get marooned on a distant planet with. So, to the Covenant!” \nWe know that this installment of Ridley Scott’s Alien franchise slides in somewhere after the events of 2012’s Prometheus and before the Nostromo starts to return to Earth as we saw in 1979’s Alien. Director Ridley Scott promises this film — which also costars Demian Bichir, Jussie Smollett, and Carmen Ejogo — will provide some answers. “ Covenant is really going to show you who did it and why .” Luke Scott ( Morgan ) directed the four-and-a-half-minute preview, conceived by father Ridley and creative firm 3AM.
