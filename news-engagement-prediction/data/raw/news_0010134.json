On Sunday, Drake spent time touching on American politics in between his sets. \n\"Every day I wake up and see all this bullsh-- going in the world, people trying to tear us apart, people trying to make us turn against each other,\" he said. \"My proudest moment -- take a look around at this room, you'll people from all races and all places.\" \nDrake continued his rousing speech by targeting Trump. \"If you think one man can tear this world apart, you're out of your motherf---ing mind. It's on us to keep this sh-- together. F--- that man.\" \nDuring that same show, Drake chimed in on his thoughts about a possible Young Money reunion show. “I just got off the phone with Nicki and she told me to tell y’all, ‘Hello,'” he said. “We might have to do something special. We might have to do some Young Money reunion sh-- out here this summer. I might have to bring all my friends from America, all my friends from Canada, the whole OVO.” \nCheck out the footage of Drake speaking on Trump below.
