(Photo: AP and USATSI) \nThe awkwardness of Kevin Durant's weekend in close proximity of former teammate Russell Westbrook was on full display during NBA All-Star weekend. \nAt times, they avoided each other. Westbrook would change the subject when asked about Durant. When Durant threw a lob to set up Westbrook's alley-oop dunk, it became the story of the night. Shaquille O'Neal says he knows exactly what both players are going through. \nIn an interview with Fox Sports , Shaq thought back to his departure from Orlando to Los Angeles. Similarly to Oklahoma City with Durant and Westbrook, the Shaq-Penny Hardaway duo had the Magic on the verge of a championship. When Shaq left for the Lakers, there was a similar rift between the two stars. \nFOX SPORTS: So, maybe the biggest story line of the season is the Kevin Durant-Russell Westbrook situation. What's your take on that, what do you think is going on there? \nO'NEAL: I've been in a similar situation. Probably due to lack of communication. I can understand what Russell's going through. I did the same thing to Penny [Anfernee Hardaway] when I signed in L.A. Me, I felt there was no need to call anybody and tell them what I was doing, and I'm sure Penny was hurt by that. I'm sure that's what it is. And then Russell's probably saying, 'You was my man, but you go to the team that beat us, and you don't even call me to tell me?' So it's just a lack of communication. They were always friends and always tight and always played together. But one lack of communication can cause everything. \nWhen Shaq left for the Lakers in 1996, Hardaway led Orlando to the playoffs the next two seasons, but failed to get out of the first round. \nHardaway found out about Shaq's move to Los Angeles when he was in Atlanta for the 1996 Olympics. Hardaway told The Oregonian's John Canzano in 2014 that he was blindsided by the news .
