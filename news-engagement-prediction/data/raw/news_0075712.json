Polish driver who was distracted by his phone and killed four people Tomasz Kroker was distracted by his phone while driving Polish lorry driver Tomasz Kroker was jailed for ten years in October for killing a mother and three children because he was distracted by his phone. Kroker was sent to prison for killing Tracy Houghton, 45, her sons Ethan, 13, and Josh, 11, and stepdaughter Aimee Goldsmith, 11, in Newbury, Berkshire. Tracy Houghton's Vauxhall Corsa was shunted under the trailer of another lorry Chilling footage from inside his lorry cab showed 30-year-old Kroker scrolling through music on his mobile for seven seconds before he ploughed into stationary traffic at 50mph. Mrs Houghton's Vauxhall Corsa was shunted under the trailer of another lorry and crushed to a third of its size in the crash last August on the A34. Ethan, 13, and Josh Houghton, 11, both died Outside Reading Crown Court, Aimee's mother Kate Goldsmith fought back tears as she urged motorists to 'stop using mobile phones while driving'. Weeks after the crash, the Daily Mail launched a campaign for tougher penalties against drivers who flout the law on using phones behind the wheel. The alarming images were taken along the A338 over the past week and are all of moving vehicles. Clearly these drivers are unaware of, or are choosing to ignore, new tougher legislation coming into force on Wednesday where they risk six penalty points on their licences and a £200 fine - double the existing amount. Under current legislation motorists who use their phones are issued with just three penalty points on their licence and a £100 fine. Last year in Britain, drivers distracted by their phone were a contributory factor in 440 accidents, including 22 which were fatal, Government figures showed. In one horrific example, trucker Tomasz Kroker killed a mother and her three young children after ploughing into their stationary car at 50mph on the A34 near Newbury, Berkshire. He had been distracted by scrolling through music on his mobile phone and was jailed for ten years. The nation reacted in horror after authorities released the truck's dash-cam footage - which showed Kroker using his phone less than a second before impact. Meanwhile, a report published by the RAC in September 2016 revealed 31 per cent of drivers had admitted to using a mobile phone when driving, up from just 8 per cent in 2014. Police hope the changes, which will apply to England, Scotland and Wales, will have a significant impact motorists, particularly younger drivers, who risk having their licence revoked following a first offence. Inspector Matt Butler, of Dorset Police's traffic department, said: 'It has been illegal to use a hand-held phone or similar device while driving or riding a motorcycle since December 2003. 'However, many motorists still fail to see that it is not possible to use a phone and be in proper control of a vehicle. 'Whatever the reason for using a mobile device when driving - texting, scanning a news feed or streaming video content - it can wait until your journey is over. 'Nothing is more important than your safety and the safety of road users around you.' Eddie Stobart HGV driver is caught on camera using his phone behind the wheel at a busy junction in heavy rain This is the moment a brazen Eddie Stobart HGV driver used his mobile phone behind the wheel at a busy junction in heavy rain. The driver - believed to be in Newport, South Wales - can clearly be seen holding the mobile with his right hand as he manoeuvres the 44-tonne truck. The footage was uploaded to YouTube by a cyclist who was stunned as the lorry passed him while he waited at a crossroads and went into a box junction.

The video description reads: 'Another professional driver using mobile phone while driving and then blocks junction with his trailer. 'Not that long ago a lorry driver (Tomasz Kroker) killed a family while changing song on his mobile device.' The 25-second-clip starts as the cyclist waits to cross the junction as vehicles start to pass into the junction in wet and rainy conditions.

The person recording the footage says: 'I can see you on your phone, boy', as the green lorry passes him as the driver steers using only his left hand. The lorry then has to stop in the box junction, due to the build-up of traffic in front, blocking the path of vehicles wanting to pass through from other directions. The footage ends as the cyclist makes his way across the road, reading out the numberplate of the lorry.
