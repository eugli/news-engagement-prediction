Things are very hard, but we have each other. \n“For the wedding to be happening now is just amazing and the kindness and faith in us is an inspiration for us to work hard to improve our situation.” \nThe wedding, which will cost about £2,000, has been funded through cash donations and people offering their services for free. The church has rented suits for the groom and groomsmen, bought Miss Richardson a wedding gown and found dresses for her bridesmaids. There will also be a three-night honeymoon at a hotel. \nThe ceremony will be held at the church on Friday. Paul Ryan, 55, who runs the outreach group, said: “We were inspired by their love for each other.” Miss Richardson said: “I dreamed of us getting married but I didn’t imagine it would be like this.” \nThe church is also trying to find a flat for the couple and asked for donations to help at justgiving.com/crowdfunding/chris-kirsty-wedding More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T16:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T12:27:06.698+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
