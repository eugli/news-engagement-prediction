The government said the UK was first to introduce a vaccination programme. 'Happy girl' \nMr Burdett and his wife Jenny had to make the decision to turn off Faye's life support. \nThe disease had led to sepsis and they had already signed forms consenting to amputations, but knew the sepsis had caused further damage. \nHe said: \"Her kidneys weren't working and the list went on and on. \n\"She fought so hard. Turning off the machine was the hardest decision we have ever had to make but it was the right thing to do.\" Image caption Faye's parents published the picture of their daughter just before her death \nHe said they remembered their daughter as a \"happy girl who loved to run around.\" \n\"She loved painting and was very clever for her age, she was so bright and determined.\" \nHe said an investigation into Faye's treatment was still ongoing, because she was sent home from Maidstone Hospital - but returned seven hours later. \nThe meningitis B vaccine, Bexsero, is available on the NHS for babies aged two months, but parents who wish to have older children vaccinated must pay privately. \nLast year, the government refused to make the vaccine more widely available - a move described by Mr Burdett as \"insulting and devastating.\" \nFormer public health minister Jane Ellison pledged to launch an awareness campaign on signs of meningitis and the government agreed to release its cost calculations for vaccines. \nA spokesman for the Department of Health said: \"The UK is the first country in the world to have introduced a national meningitis B vaccination programme using Bexsero. \n\"We have made important progress, vaccinating more than one million babies since September 2015, in which time the number of cases in infants aged one and under has dropped by 50%. \n\"In addition our public awareness campaigns on sepsis and meningitis B have seen millions of leaflets distributed to GP clinics, hospitals and other public places - and we'll set out further plans shortly.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:17:04.222+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
