You don’t just provide fingerprints and your full travel history, you receive a background check including criminal background check and an in-person interview. \nWhat’s more, someone may have had the status for 5 years and done nothing harmful or dangerous in that time. \nCopyright: prestonia / 123RF Stock Photo \nTo be fair, the government hasn’t explained that this is what they’re doing. There’s apparently a big uptick in these Global Entry revocations, and multiple examples of revocations of dual citizens who hold US citizenship and citizenship from one of the 7 banned countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. \nPlenty of snowflake readers who support the executive order have complained about reading contrary viewpoints, but this is fundamentally about travel. It’s not just about who can travel here, about what citizens are going through as they enter the country or proceed through airport security, but will also affect how others travel abroad and run into reciprocity restrictions that other nations might put into place. This is very much developing, and I believe important to keep track of.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T05:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:03:59.449+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
