Even the haters and losers will be saying 'Thank you, Donald.'” By Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg/Getty Images. It’s almost surprising that Donald Trump didn’t go on to describe his secret plan to lower taxes as big, beautiful, and terrific. It’s not at all surprising that he provided zero actual specifics for this big league phenomenal plan. Per Bloomberg : \nDuring a meeting with U.S. airline executives, Trump said his plans call for “lowering the overall tax burden of American businesses, big league.” He added: “We’re going to be announcing something I would say over the two or three weeks that will be phenomenal in terms of tax.” \nTrump offered no details—and White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters later that specifics would emerge only in the coming weeks. Still, he said the White House is at work on an outline of the most comprehensive business and individual tax overhaul since 1986. Look, anyone can give you boring policy details, but it’s the rare, unpresidented leader who can tell you this thing is going to be “big league” and “phenomenal.” It’s going to be the best, everyone’s going to say it’s the best, they’re going to say crooked Hillary would never have come up with a plan this great, period. Comprehensive tax reform, of course is one of the main reasons that people on Wall Street and in the business community supported Trump when they might otherwise have been too turned off by his protectionist rhetoric and “locker room” talk. For years, tax reform been the white whale of Paul Ryan and other Republican supply-siders seeking to slash rates and regulations. Lately, though, investors have begun to get the creeping suspicion that whatever benefits they might derive from tax reform and other pro-growth policies might be outweighed by the crazier pronouncements emanating from the West Wing. Perhaps the less skeptical among them will cheer today’s announcement, detail-less though it may be. If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, click here to subscribe. G.O.P. congressman outlines plan to cut Dodd-Frank off at the knees As some of you may recall, last Friday Donald Trump signed what felt like his 999th and 1,000th executive orders, directing regulators to “review” things like Dodd-Frank and the fiduciary rule and get back to him on where they could be gutted like fish. Some people, like Senator Elizabeth Warren, and retirees who’d prefer not to spend the last years of their lives bagging groceries for minimum wage, didn’t like these orders. Others, like the banks who may save billions in legal, compliance, and capital costs, and the congressional Republicans who effect a Pavlovian hostility to the word “regulation,” could barely contain their excitement. House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling fell into the latter camp. Having toiled away at legislation that would severely weaken Dodd-Frank and strip power from that lousy Consumer Financial Protection Bureau created under that killjoy Barack Obama , he finally—finally!— had a president who got him. So he scurried back to his office and with a bunch of aides, worked the entirety of the weekend writing a memo stating his intentions. They involve letting banks chill on the harsh capital requirements some people want them to face and not letting the bureau, established to protect consumers, do anything without Congress’s permission. Oh, and he doesn't want consumers to be able to log complaints about financial firms, either. Per Bloomberg : \nStress tests administered annually by the Federal Reserve evaluate whether banks have enough capital to weather a severe financial crisis. Lenders that fail face restrictions on paying out dividends and buying back shares. Hensarling wants to loosen the requirements by subjecting banks to tests every other year, and exempting lenders from the exams altogether if they agree to dramatically increase their capital, the memo shows. \nHensarling’s updated proposal would also largely toss out one of the exam’s toughest components—the so-called qualitative test that evaluates a bank’s plans for managing capital and risk. That part of the yearly exercise has been a thorn in the side of some firms, including the U.S. units of Deutsche Bank AG and Banco Santander SA. \nFor the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Hensarling proposes that the controversial regulator only be able to pass rules that have been mandated by Congress, according to the memo. He also wants to eliminate its authority to supervise financial firms and get rid of a database of consumer complaints. More broadly, he wants to eliminate much of the CFPB’s regulatory powers, and transform it into a law enforcement agency. Nordstrom shares surge despite—because of?—attack by Daddy Trump Thursday afternoon, Donald Trump made history as the first president of the United States to Twitter-shame a public company because it was mean to his daughter. (And by mean, we mean Nordstrom made the business decision to stop carrying Ivanka Trump’s clothing line due to poor sales.) Of course, this was not the first time that Trump had used his position of power to chew out companies that displeased him, which is problematic in and of itself. But this was the first instance in which he presumably considered the ethical conflicts involved in attacking a corporation because it hurt his daughter’s ability to make money and said screw it and did it anyway. (Just kidding, we’re sure he didn’t actually think this one through!) In the past, an 140-character missive from the Tweeter-in-Chief would send shares of a company plummeting (Lockheed Martin Corp. knows what we’re talking about). In the case of Nordstrom, though, something delightful happened : after falling slightly following the tweet about how “unfair” and “terrible!” the company was, shares “climbed for the rest of the trading session and continued to rise on Thursday, reaching the highest point since January 4,” almost as if to say, “Hey, Donny-boy, YOU WERE SAYING?“ In related news, it’s possible that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway broke federal law by promoting Ivanka’s brand . (Trump, as president, continues to be in the clear.) Did Anthony Scaramucci sell his company for nothing? As we’ve previously discussed, Trump is the sort of boss who prefers to allow his staff to fight amongst themselves for his attention, a Darwinian approach that is generally disfavored by management experts and industrial psychologists. As a result, the body count among his campaign staff and transition team was plentiful. Now that he’s in the White House, things haven’t really changed, as money man turned Trump booster Anthony Scaramucci knows full-well. The irrepressible investment firm founder hitched his wagon to Trump’s star during his bid for the presidency, hoping it would pay off with a high-level job in the administration. And, for a while, it did! Scaramucci even sold his company, Skybridge Capital, to a Chinese conglomerate in order to formally begin his gig as an assistant to the president. That was, until he was told he didn’t have the job, supposedly due to the long vetting process required to parse the various conflicts of interest involved in the sale, though other reports indicated that certain people in the White House (take a bow, Reince Priebus ) simply wanted him gone for personal reasons. “The Mooch,” however, remains hopeful this thing can still be salvaged, according to the Post : \nAnthony Scaramucci paid a visit to the White House on Wednesday in a last-ditch effort to keep alive the offer of a top job in the Trump administration, The Post has learned. The 53-year-old investor met with Trump senior advisers in the West Wing, including possibly Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the president himself, sources said. Scaramucci is hoping to ease concerns about the $200 million sale of his hedge fund, SkyBridge Capital, to investors led by China-based HNA Group. \nIn an attempt to repair the damage, The Mooch, as he is affectionately known on Wall Street, rejiggered the deal and has agreed to sell his stake to his partners ahead of any overall sale, sources said. \nStill, The Mooch has to win over Priebus who was, perhaps, the Wall Streeter’s most vocal critic, sources said. It was Priebus who put up the roadblock, three sources close to the situation said. Elsewhere!
