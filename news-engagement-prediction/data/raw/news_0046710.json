While tens of thousands of drivers daily will be inconvenienced, in they end, they — and their vehicles — should be happier. \n\"Short-term inconvenience for a long-term gain of convenience,\" that's how Wendy Batiste-Johnson, a daily Hall Road driver and general manager of the Mall at Partridge Creek, looked at the pending construction. \"Hall Road needs this type of repair. Who knew we'd be excited about construction.\" \nHall Road is so bad that the potholes have potholes. \nSeriously. \nRoad crews patch frequently, slowing and shifting traffic on the east-west retail and restaurant corridor in the middle of the county; but rubber still pokes out of the potholes that pockmark the multiple-lane thoroughfare on both sides. \nAs soon as March 1, crews will start rebuilding the road; installing modern traffic signals; improving drainage, ramps and sidewalks; replacing signs; filling the gaps in the sidewalks, and adding trees, plants and shrubs and other aesthetic improvements. A fourth lane in one stretch will be added in each direction next year. Buy Photo \nHall Road reconstruction map (Photo: Martha Thierry/Detroit Free Press) \nThe new road, which will have an asphalt driving surface instead of concrete, is expected to last 20-25 years and have better traffic flow. \nUnlike southbound I-75 between Detroit and Downriver, which is closed for two years to rebuild the deck on the Rouge River Bridge, Hall Road will remain open during the reconstruction project, with Michigan Department of Transportation officials doing their best to accommodate the flurry of businesses — from small eateries to national stores, medical facilities and the central campus of Macomb Community College — and residents living in apartments, condos and homes on both sides of the corridor. \nAbout 90,000 vehicles travel the road daily, the most densely populated business corridor in the state, said Jim Petronski, MDOT's construction engineer on the project.

The first phase of the project starts in March 2017. (Photo: Christina Hall, Detroit Free Press) \n\"Some of our freeways don't ever get that (traffic),\" he said. \nThe project has been in the works for about two years, but expanded from a proposed $32-million job in Sterling Heights, Shelby Township and Utica last year to a $60-million job that expanded east to include work in Macomb and Clinton townships. Just under 4 miles of the eastbound and westbound lanes will be reconstructed. The communities are pitching in about $1 million for some of the improvements, Petronski said. \nThe first phase will be from Delco Boulevard, just east of M-53, to just west of Garfield Road. The work will be done from March through October. \nNext year, the work picks up where it ended, extending east toward Romeo Plank Road, with construction expected to last from March to September. A fourth lane will be added on both sides of Hall Road between Garfield and Romeo Plank as part of that work. \nThree lanes will be open in each direction through the reconstruction area during peak times from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m., with two lanes open each way from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. Only two lanes will be open in each direction on the M-59 bridge over M-53 through mid-summer of this year. Crews will temporarily widen the road to house the third lane. Reconstruction work will start on the right two lanes and shoulder in each direction. \nConstruction will be occurring day and night, weekdays and weekends. Business and pedestrian access will be maintained. However, if a business has two driveways, one will be closed and the other will remain open. If a business only has one driveway, it will be open part-width, Petronski said. Bus stops will remain along the thoroughfare. \n\"We are doing our best to keep people on M-59 to frequent the businesses and go to the gas stations,\" he said. \nHe said all four major intersections at Hall Road — Hayes, Schoenherr, Garfield and Romeo Plank — will be closed for 10-day periods of time during the projects, so north and south traffic on those roads will not be able to cross Hall Road. Schoenherr will have a 20-day closure, but 10 of those days traffic will be able to get through. Buy Photo \nPotholes along M-59/Hall Road near Lakeside Mall in Macomb County on Feb. 14, 2017.

(Photo: Christina Hall, Detroit Free Press) \nPetronski said the new traffic signals will be connected-vehicle ready for when that technology is developed, and there will be a half-dozen crosswalks added to cross Hall Road. He said future maintenance on the road, which he said was widened in the mid-1990s, is expected to be \"a lot less invasive to the public.\" \nM-59 crosses northern metro Detroit between Howell at I-96 on the west and I-94 on the Chesterfield-Harrison township line near Selfridge Air National Guard Base on the east. It is a major connector for east-west motorists going from I-75 to I-94. \nJohn Paul Rea, the county's planning and economic development director, previously called M-59 a job cluster and a \"prominent regional corridor\" that has upwards of 23,000 jobs from Mound Road to I-94. \n\"I know it's going to be a hassle when it does start, but I know it needs to be done,\" said Dianne Vollick of Shelby Township, who takes Hayes Road to her job at the La-Z-Boy store near Lakeside Mall in Sterling Heights to avoid driving on Hall Road. \"It is so terribly bad I don't go on it. It's barely a road.\" \nMelissa Bilunes of Warren, an assistant manager at Jersey Mike's Subs, won't be able to avoid Hall Road to get to work. She said she plans to leave about 40 minutes before her shift starts to get to work on time, adding: \"hopefully, that's enough.\" \n\"It definitely needs some help. There are a lot of potholes,\" she said of the road's condition. \nThose who live in the area around Hall Road or are familiar with it will be savvy and plan to use back ways to get around the construction. \nPatrick Moore of Clinton Township, who works in Auburn Hills, said he normally stays away from Hall Road because of how busy it is. But he drove on it Tuesday to get to the Mall at Partridge Creek. He had one initial word when he heard the rebuild was coming: \"awesome.\" \n\"It's terrible. Huge potholes,\" he said. \nBusinesses are expecting a bit of an impact with people possibly altering their shopping or dining out patterns because of the construction. Petronski said he plans to visit every business in the impacted stretch, getting contact information for managers to be able to provide regular updates. \nThe two large shopping malls — the Mall at Partridge Creek and Lakeside Mall — have other access points other than Hall Road. And the construction will be done in time for the holiday shopping season. \nMelanie Davis, president and CEO of the Sterling Heights Regional Chamber of Commerce & Industry — which is located in the pothole zone on Hall Road — said her group will be working with businesses and the website www.MovingMacomb.org to provide regular updates on businesses during construction, with maps of open driveways to help motorists. \nShe said keeping the driveways open \"was a big relief to the business community.\" \n\"It's gonna be painful, but we need to do this to help the corridor be economically viable,\" said Davis, who regularly drives Hall Road and sees crews regularly patching. \"The short-term pain with long-term gain.\" \nContact Christina Hall: chall99@freepress.com.
