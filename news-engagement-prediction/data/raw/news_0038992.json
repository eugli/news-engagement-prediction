(Buda Mendes / Getty Images) Lance Pugmire women’s featherweight fighter Cris “Cyborg” Justino skirted a possibly lengthy suspension Friday when a U.S. Anti-Doping Agency committee announced it has granted her a retroactive exemption after she used a banned diuretic for medical reasons.\n“I am extremely happy,” the Southland-trained Brazilian Justino said in a statement Friday after her application for the so-called therapeutic use exemption (TUE) was granted. “I look forward to returning to the octagon as soon as possible and proving that I am still the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world.” \nUFC President Dana White said the decision moves Justino (16-1) to the front of the line to meet Germaine De Randamie (7-3), who became the first UFC women’s featherweight champion Saturday night in New York by defeating Holly Holm by unanimous decision. \n“It’s a great day,” White said. “The fight everyone wants to see now is Germaine and Cyborg, that’ll be a great thing.” \nJeff Novitzky, the UFC’s vice president of athlete health and performance, said the episode underlined both the fairness of the due-process avenues available to UFC athletes and the importance for other UFC athletes to seek a TUE before taking a substance like Justino’s, which is on the banned list for its performance-enhancing effects. \nJustino, who has claimed she’s suffered through weight-cutting trials in the past, told the USADA that the substance she took in this case was used to treat fertility issues. \n“[USADA] took an objective look at it and their conclusion was she checked all the boxes,” Novitzky said. “She had an objective, measurable medical condition and she had exhausted other medical treatments for that condition that were within the rules. This substance treats that condition and would not provide her a performance-enhancing effect by using it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T04:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:13:07.320+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
