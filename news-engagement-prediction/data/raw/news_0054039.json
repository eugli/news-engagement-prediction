Photo: Sean Gallup (Getty) \nScore one for the big guy. \nSo just like a study revealed that people actually get less pissy as they age , and just like a study said that women with bigger butts are smarter and healthier , it seems there is a new study out there that’s going to make obese dudes feel a tad better about themselves. Even though it’s best you don’t reach obesity, if you do happen to get quite large it may benefit you in the bedroom. Why’s that? Well, according to research conducted by Turkey’s Erciyes University, there is a direct correlation between physical size and endurance. Well would you look at that?

Now this is possible because it seems that overweight men have a higher presence of estradiol, a female sex hormone, which actually inhibits the male orgasm. Science! And because of this ejaculation is delayed a tad, forcing more stimulus to the goods in order to reach PleasureVille. Here’s more pretty baffling research. The study also revealed a reverse pattern which seems to substantiate their claims — patients with lifelong premature ejaculation are usually on the skinner side of things. So us skinny guys are screwed.
