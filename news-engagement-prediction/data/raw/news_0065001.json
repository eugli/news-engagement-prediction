It is not easy for all Tzu Chi people to attain these achievements,” said the 81-year old spiritual leader in a rare interview, given to 18 journalists from Malaysia, Indonesia and Hong Kong on Tuesday. \nThe Star was the only English media invited to this interview. \nIn response to a question on how Tzu Chi could play a role in solving international conflicts and terrorism, Cheng Yen said: “One organisation cannot do everything. Every­body has a role to play. Just do what is right, and don’t count yourself out in good deeds.” \nOn whether she would come to Malaysia where there were one million supporters of and donors to Tzu Chi, the influential religious master said politely in Mandarin: “Maybe in the next future life. But my time is not up yet.” \nA team of doctors surrounding this frail woman leader dressed in a light blue robe has not allowed her to travel out of Taiwan. \nShe is referred to as shang ren , a title for someone who has attained enlightenment in Buddhism. \nShe gives sermons to followers worldwide at 5.20am daily via the Da-ai TV channel financed by income generated from Tzu Chi’s recycling programmes worldwide. \nShe also listens to daily briefings by various working teams from, among others, Tzu Chi hospital, university and schools at 7.10am, and gives her views and instructions after the hour long session. \nThe visiting media were allowed to sit in on Tuesday. \nBefore the media dialogue started, co-founder of Apple Vacations Group Datuk Seri Lee San briefed Cheng Yen that he had taken the initiative to organise this media visit so that journalists could understand the good work of Tzu Chi and witness how good values could inject “positive energy” into an organisation that serves society. \n“I find Malaysia needing more positive energy to turn it into a better place to live. \n“The media can play a role by reporting good deeds done by good people and organisations such as Tzu Chi which I have great respect for,” he said before introducing all the media to the host at Tzu Chi headquarters here in mid-east Taiwan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:27:14.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
