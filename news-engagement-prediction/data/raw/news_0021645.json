He pressed a lawyer for the state of Washington, which filed the lawsuit against the government, to explain why the president would not have the authority to bar people from countries that pose a significant risk of terrorism. \n“I have trouble understanding why we’re supposed to infer religious animus,’’ said Judge Clifton. “The concern for terrorism with those connected to radical Islamic sects is kind of hard to deny.’’ \nMr. Purcell answered that by the president’s own statements, and those of some of his advisers, the executive order grew out of a desire to keep Muslims out of the country. \n“At this point it’s now the federal government that’s asking the courts to upset the status quo,’’ Mr. Purcell said. “Things are slowly returning to normal before the chaos of the executive order.’’ Devlin Barrett ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T11:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T07:06:09.315+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
