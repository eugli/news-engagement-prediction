It’s hard for other people to understand the depths of your emotions (Picture: Giphy) \nDespite quite probably sounding like an utter nightmare right now there are some positives to living with BPD. \nBecause I’m governed so deeply by my raging emotions I’ve become very adept at picking up how others feel. This means I’ll probably notice you’re upset before you even realise and I’ll be there to mull it over, give you a hug or just a quick squeeze and let you get on with it. \nI listen to absolutely everyone when they express how they feel, even if they think it’s a bit silly, because I know every emotion is valid. \nAnd I think that’s the key to supporting the person with BPD in your life – communication. \nSpeaking about how you feel might not always make sense at first but I guarantee after a chat you’ll have both learned something about each other that’ll make your relationship stronger going forward. \nIf you feel like you might be struggling with Borderline Personality Disorder or any other mental health issue, speak to your GP or call Mind on 0300 123 3393.
