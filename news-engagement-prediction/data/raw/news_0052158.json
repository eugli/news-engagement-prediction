The “undateable girl” might want to seek out Prince Charming , but she has too many unrealistic expectations she wants the dude to meet. \nSo, she nixes each and every guy who tries to impress her because she’s picky AF. \nIf you’re longing to find your soulmate, being the “undateable girl” can certainly cause a ton of problems and unnecessary stress in your love life. \nDO NOT fret though, ladies. Although you won’t break out of the “undateable girl” stereotype overnight, there are ways to deal with (and conquer) this sensitive situation. \nHere are seven signs you really are “the undateable girl,” and how to fix it. 1. You seem to find fault with every guy you go out with. Kayla Snell \nIf you’re picky and totally OK with it, that’s fine. But make sure you’re cutting the guy some slack! \nThe right man may come along, but you probably won’t even see him. You’re blinded by the list of expectations you want him to meet instead of focusing on all of the unique, incredible qualities he already has to offer. 2. You may be super emotional and reveal way too much, way too soon. \nDon’t be that v. emotional chick who pours her heart out to a guy on the first date. Exude a sense of mystery, leaving him wanting to know more about you. \nIf you bluntly put all of your feelings out on the table way too early, chances are, you’ll scare him away. He’ll be sprinting for the hills rejoicing he dodged a major bullet. 3. You love single life to a fault, and don’t want anything to get in the way of that. Lumina \nSingle life can be absolutely incredible and freeing. Your squad is life, and nothing can get between you and your gal pals. \nBut being undateable forever can turn out to be an extremely lonely life… especially if and when all of your friends suddenly get into serious relationships. Then, what do you have left? \nOpen your eyes and look at the bigger picture. 4. You’re a boss career woman who makes work her top priority. \nYou go, girl. Excelling in your career is a high like no other — and YES, it should be a top priority. \nMake sure you’re not focused on your career 24/7, where you leave no room for playing the dating field. A guy will probably find this intimidating and think you don’t have any time for him… because you don’t. \nKnowing how to have a work/life balance is everything. 5. You have ZERO patience for bullshit. \nMany gals out there have absolutely no time or patience for bullshit… as they should! \nBut don’t let every single thing he does annoy the crap out of you. It’s not fair to him, and he doesn’t deserve that. Live a little bit. 6. You’re waiting for the perfect guy, because you think so many are imperfect. Studio Firma \nEvery girl has a vision of her ideal guy, just as much as a guy has his idea of an ultimate babe. \nBut IRL, you can’t let this vision keep you from what’s staring you in the face. Don’t keep yourself secluded to a dream world, and don’t be so stubborn. \nIt’s important to remember nobody is perfect, and there may not be anyone who actually meets all of your requirements. And HEY — you may not meet all of his, either. 7. You’re terrified and hold yourself back. \nNever hold yourself back TOO much. You want to give him a chance, but more importantly, you want to make sure you’re giving yourself a chance, too. \nBabe Ruth once said, \nNever let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game. \nDon’t close yourself off to love forever, because that will turn out to be a pretty sad life. \nEmbrace each new guy with a positive outlook, and if things don’t work out, they don’t! But at least you’re putting yourself out there and gave it a shot. \nIt’s worth the risk, and you’ll break out of the “undateable girl” zone. How You Know When You're In Love.
