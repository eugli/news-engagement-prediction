I dug a hole in the ground to save my money. \n“Unfortunately, one day, some Libyans came, kidnapped us and inflicted punishment on us. \n“They asked us to call our relations back in Nigeria and tell them to send N300, 000 as our ransom. \n“The 200, 000 US dollars that I saved, disappeared; they moved us to another place until we got to detention camp. \n“Nigerians should be discouraged from travelling to Libya because they are not treating us like human beings. \n“Our ladies were dehumanised by Libyan officials, it is very painful,” he said. \nIduh, who said he sold the house left by his late father before travelling to Libya, urged the federal and state governments as well as wealthy Nigerians to create job for the youths. \n“It was because I was jobless for three years that I was cajoled to travel abroad to look for greener pasture. \n“I am back in the country after eight months, devastated and humiliated. \n“I have gone to look for greener pasture but here I am today; I have brought nothing green back home,” he said with tears running in his cheek. \nPaul and Marvellous Isikhuemhen are twin brothers who travelled to Libya in March and May 2016 respectively in search for greener pasture. \nMarvellous said that they regretted travelling out of the country because of the bitter encounter they had in Libya. \nHe said that though they secured good job in publishing house in Libya, “it was suffering and smiling’’ until they were given the opportunity to return home through IOM. \nIsikhuemhen urged the Nigerian government to stop young ladies from travelling to Libya, saying they were molested by Libyan immigration officials. \nHe said that most Nigerian ladies bribe Nigerian Immigration Officers to secure travel documents to travel to Libya. \nIsikhuemhen added that most of the children brought back home by these ladies had no fathers. \n“I can boldly tell you that the children you are seeing in their hands and those pregnant ladies are products of Libya immigration officers,” he said. adekunle ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T19:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T14:24:45.960+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
