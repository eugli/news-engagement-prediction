AAP Share on Twitter \nThe AFL has called for patience with the new women’s league, promising it will work and predicting plenty of development over the next three years. While there is plenty of goodwill for the inaugural season, AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan anticipated the inevitable criticism that will come, when he spoke at Wednesday’s launch. \nCarlton and Collingwood will play the first AFL women’s match for premiership points on Friday night at Ikon Park. \n“I’d like to remind everyone this is year one (and) 176 women making their debut this weekend carry an extraordinary amount on their shoulders,” McLachlan said. “I will ask today that we give them time and space to grow into the elite footballers that we know they can be. \n“We are here for the long haul — let’s back our players in. \n“I can guarantee you the AFLW in three years will be vastly different to year one.” McLachlan also stressed that the AFLW will succeed off the field as well. “I want to be clear — this will be good for business, but, as compelling, it can be explained in two words — equality and aspiration,” McLachlan said. “It will be football as we’ve always known it ... but it will also be very different.” And McLachlan said the AFL are determined to make the league work. “You can play with confidence that the AFL is here to back you in and support this league for the long term,” he said. \nThe launch featured the unveiling of the AFLW premiership cup. Western Bulldogs vice-president Susan Alberti, a long-time supporter of women in the game, will be the cup ambassador. \nShe predicts the league will expand from the current eight-team competition, but also said it will take time. \n“Being on the advisory board you get a fair bit of information and you can see that the other teams really do want to be a part of it,” she said. “But some of them aren’t ready yet ... they’re more at grassroots than some of the clubs that are already there. Amanda Farrugia (Giants), Daisy Pearce (Demons), Emma Zielke (Lions), Steph Chiocci (Magpies), Lauren Arnell (Blues), Kara Donnellan (Dockers), Katie Brennan (Bulldogs) and Chelsea Randall (Crows) pose with the AFL Women's premiership cup.

We want to have an attractive brand of football — that’s what it’s all about.” \nMelbourne captain Daisy Pearce has been another prominent figure in the AFLW’s creation. \nShe said on Wednesday that the league will quickly reflect the creation of development pathways for younger players. \n“It’s a different breed ... in time, it will just completely redefine the competition,” she said of the next generation of women’s players. “But that’s not to say what you turn up and see this weekend won’t be worth watching — there’s a real pureness and rawness to the football played at the moment. \n“There are some genuine superstars and it’s going to be great viewing.” \nRound One fixture (All times AEDT) \nCarlton v Collingwood, Ikon Park, Melbourne, Friday, 7.45pm \nAdelaide v GWS, Thebarton Oval, Adelaide, Saturday, 5.05pm \nWestern Bulldogs v Fremantle, Whitten Oval, Melbourne, Saturday, 7.40pm \nMelbourne v Brisbane Lions, Casey Fields, Melbourne, Sunday, 5.05pm \nAFL DECIDES AGAINST FINES FOR WOMEN These women are ready to turn the sporting world on its head. Source: News Corp Australia \nReprimands and suspensions will be the only penalties in the AFLW tribunal system, with the league deciding against fines. \nFormer Australian netball captain Sharelle McMahon will also sit on the women’s league match review panel, along with ex-AFL players Michael Christian and Luke Ball, plus AFL officials. \nThe league decided against fines because the league is not fully-professional and will only run for seven weeks. \n“Players will not face financial sanctions as happens in the AFL for low level offences, such as wrestling and melee offences,” said AFL development manager Simon Lethlean. \nA player can accept a reprimand for a first low-level offence, but will be liable for suspension if she offends again during the season. The women’s tribunal system will be similar to how it operates in the AFL, with players able to accept early pleas for all but the most serious charges. \n— AAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T06:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:27:17.941+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
