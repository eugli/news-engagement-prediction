A post shared by Kasper Schmeichel (@kasperschmeichel) on Feb 24, 2017 at 12:58pm PST \n“He deserves massive respect and huge credit for what he achieved here with us. Thanks boss.” \nIt is understood that Leicester’s senior players told the club’s owners they were unhappy with Ranieri after meeting them on Thursday morning following the Champions League 2-1 defeat at Sevilla. \nThe meeting was called by the owners - not the players - and they were told by the senior professionals that the relationship between Ranieri and the other members of the coaching staff, including assistant manager Craig Shakespeare, had broken down.

Source: Getty Images \nSpeaking ahead of the game against Liverpool as caretaker manager, Shakespeare denied his relationship with Ranieri had deteriorated. \nHe said: “A lot of it has been speculation without foundation. My relationship with Claudio has been perfectly fine all along - I’ve never had a problem with him and he’s never had a problem with me. \n“We spoke on the phone after the news broke, and he actually thanked me for my support. He seemed fine, a bit shocked but his tone was no different.” Jose goes to bat for Ranieri 1:03 \nOn reports some players had spoken to the club’s owners behind Ranieri’s back, Shakespeare added: “I’m not aware of any senior players going to the owners so that’s news to me.” \nPremier League managers also came out in support for Ranieri on Friday. Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho said: “He is somebody that probably deserves to have the Leicester stadium named ‘The Claudio Ranieri Stadium’.” \nSky Sports pundit Paul Merson did not hold back with his disgust at the decision by saying neutral football fans would want to see Leicester relegated after their “average” players “stuck the knife” into their manager.
