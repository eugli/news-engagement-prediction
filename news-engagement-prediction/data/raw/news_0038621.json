LONGHOUSE residents in Kuala Lumpur are set to hit the jackpot, following the Government’s offer to sell them flats at a big discount. \nThousands of poverty-stricken families are set to benefit once the affordable housing initiatives are completed. \nAmong them are the first generation families from the former Bukit Kiara Estate relocated to longhouses in Taman Tun Dr Ismail (TTDI). They will be offered units in TTDI at just a fraction of the original price. \nThe smallest built-up of 800sq ft in TTDI today can easily fetch between RM900 and RM1,200 per sq ft. However, the Bukit Kiara longhouse residents will be able to buy their apartments at a 95% discount. \nFederal Territories Minister Tengku Adnan Tengku Mansor told StarMetro that he was in the midst of negotiating the prices for low and medium-cost houses with developers for long-time squatters who lived in transit homes for decades. Anjali Anthony and husband Mark Raj, both 36, who live at Jinjang Utara longhouse hope for better living conditions for their children. \nA total 1,445 units measuring 700 to 800sq ft, each with three bedrooms and two toilets, will be sold to these families. \nAreas where the upcoming units are located include Kepong, Bandar Tun Razak, Segambut and Cheras. Prices will be set below the RM50,000 mark, with units in some areas possibly going for as low as RM28,000. \nTengku Adnan said the price range would vary around RM28,000, RM35,000, RM42,000 and RM45,000 depending on several factors which he declined to reveal. \nHowever, going by Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) rules on the sale of low-cost units like the People’s Housing Project (PPR), it is likely that a 10-year moratorium period will be imposed on the properties to deter the owners from selling their units. \nOwners looking to sell their units at the end of the moratorium deadline have to write in to the Kuala Lumpur mayor to get permission to do so and this is subject to DBKL’s approval. \n“Either way, it is a windfall for the new owners as the apartments are located in rapidly growing commercial areas,” said Shamini Store, a real estate agent. \n“Take Jinjang Utara and Jinjang Selatan Tambahan, for example. Despite it being an old township, it is a mere 11km or 20 minutes’ drive to KLCC and KL Sentral. \n“The smallest built-up of 800sq ft with no facilities in the township can range between RM350,000 and RM380,000. \n“In Bandar Tun Razak and Cheras, the prices of residential units can be anything from RM300,000 to RM380,000, and this is also due to the location being a mature township,” she said. \nIn Taman Tun Dr Ismail, however, Store said the price of a similar-sized apartment can easily fetch RM900 to RM1,200 per sq ft if it was a normal condominium with facilities. \n“The units are on land adjacent to Taman Rimba Kiara and that in itself is a goldmine,” she added. \nTengku Adnan said he was pushing developers to start their projects as soon as possible. \nHe said the project to build new homes for the former Bukit Kiara estate residents would start soon. \nD \n“ \n“We are also negotiating a reasonable rate for second-generation families to buy units as well,” \n“For Jinjang Utara residents, their offer letters will be ready soon and we expect to sign the MoU with DBKL and the Urban Wellbeing and Housing Ministry soon,” \nHe added that units would be sold to Jinjang Utara residents for RM35,000 in a rent-to-own scheme under the People’ \nMeanwhile, 200 units will be sold to residents of Ikan Emas longhouse in Bandar Tun Razak, after the redevelopment of the three low-cost flats – Sri Johor, Sri Pulau Pinang, Sri Melaka and the Taman Ikan Emas – \nThe project is part of the Government’s “Sustainable People Housing for Urban Renewal” \nThe former longhouse residents o \n“ \n“ \n“ \nBut as a responsible government, it is up to us to solve this problem,” \nTengku Adnan elaborated that the government’ \nHe gave assurance that the Government would fulfil its promise to prepare \n“At this point in time, it is crucial for the Government to expedite their move into affordable housing in the city,”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:35:25.682+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
