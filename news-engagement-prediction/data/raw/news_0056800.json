An Introduction January 27, 2017 9:00 AM by Madeleine Luckel 1 / 8 King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden and his wife Silvia Sommerlath in Sweden on their wedding day, June 19, 1976. Photo: Getty Images By now, we are all very familiar with Kate Middleton . Nearly her every outfit, appearance, and quote are chronicled in England and abroad. But there is another European royal family filled with young, well-dressed, members who are focused on doing good. The Swedish Royal Family may not get a lot of attention on this side of the Atlantic—but Crown Princess Victoria, Prince Carl Philip, and Princess Madeleine could very well be your next royal obsession. Each one of the siblings is married to a commoner , and has a young family of their own. Yes, you may have swooned at the sight of Prince Carl Philip and his wife, Princess Sofia, at their son’s christening last year , but there’s a lot more you should know. Below, an introductory guide to the Swedish Royal Family. King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia Are the Current Heads of the Family At age 27, King Carl XVI Gustaf became the seventh king of the House of Bernadotte. His father died in a plane crash a year after his birth, so he inherited the crown from his grandfather. Carl Gustaf met his wife, who is now styled as Queen Silvia, at the 1972 Munich Summer Olympics. She was a commoner, and grew up in both Germany and Brazil. She is also the first Swedish royal to have had a career, and worked previously as an interpreter. The couple married in 1976. Prince Carl Philip Was Born Crown Prince, But Then the Title Switched to His Older Sister Victoria King Carl Gustaf ascended the throne over his older sisters due to his gender. But during his reign, Sweden’s law of absolute primogeniture was passed. (Absolute primogeniture means that the first-born child, regardless of gender and including an older female heir, takes precedence over a younger one in line for the throne.) At the time, Princess Victoria was 3 years old, and her younger brother, then–Crown Prince Carl Philip, was a baby. The law was made retroactive, meaning that Victoria became Crown Princess. Crown Princess Victoria Married Her Personal Trainer On June 19, 2010, Crown Princess Victoria, Duchess of Västergötland, married Daniel Westling. Westling met Crown Princess Victoria while working as her personal trainer, and previously owned a gym as well. Upon their marriage, he gained the title H.R.H. Prince Daniel, Duke of Västergötland. For her wedding day, Crown Princess Victoria wore an off-the-shoulder gown by Swedish designer Pär Engsheden. She reportedly wore the same crown that her mother had worn on her wedding day, which also took place on June 19. Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel now have two children together, Princess Estelle, who is second in line for the throne, and Prince Oscar. Princess Madeleine’s Husband Is Technically Not an Official Member of the Royal Family On June 8, 2013, Princess Madeleine married Christopher O’Neill. The couple met in New York City, where Princess Madeleine was living at the time. O’Neill is a British-American businessman who was born in England, but went to school at Boston University. Unlike Daniel Westling, O’Neill did not take the Bernadotte name. Because of this, and the fact that he declined Swedish citizenship, O’Neill does not hold any royal titles. This also makes him not an official member of the Swedish Royal Family. On her wedding day, Princess Madeleine, who is also styled as Duchess of Hälsingland and Gästrikland, wore a Valentino gown. The reception featured a pyramidal cake constructed out of macaroons. The couple now has two children together, Princess Leonore and Prince Nicolas. Princess Sofia, Who Is the Wife of Prince Carl Philip, Is a Former Model and Reality TV Star On June 13, 2015, Prince Carl Philip married his girlfriend Sofia Hellqvist. Hellqvist was already known throughout Sweden from her career as a model and as a reality TV star. On her wedding day, Hellqvist wore a dress by Swedish designer Ida Sjöstedt. The bride and groom both gave emotional speeches during the reception afterwards, and the couple and their guests then dined on pop rock cakes. Sofia became H.R.H. Princess Sofia, Duchess of Värmland (Prince Carl Philip is also styled as the Duke of Värmland.) The couple’s son, Prince Alexander, was born in 2016. Crown Princess Victoria, Prince Carl Philip, and Princess Madeleine Are All Active Members of the Royal Family All three siblings travel frequently on behalf of the royal family, both inside the country and abroad. When King Carl XVI Gustaf is traveling, Crown Princess Victoria serves as regent. If she too is out of the country, her brother and then sister fulfill the role. Like her younger sister, Crown Princess Victoria has also lived in the United States. Crown Princess Victoria attended Yale University in the U.S. for five semesters, and completed a number of internships while living here. While Princess Madeleine lived in New York City, she worked at the World Childhood Foundation, an organization founded by her mother. Princess Madeleine continues to focus on childhood as one of her signature issue. Until 2010, compulsory military service was required for all men in Sweden. Prince Carl Philip completed his service, and Crown Princess Victoria completed basic military training.
