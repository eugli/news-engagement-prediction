SUPPLIED \nAuckland entertainer Will Martin was working on the ship at the time and captured the miraculous rescue on video. \nThe ship was immediately turned around in the hopes of locating the woman. \nREAD MORE: \nTwo life rings were deployed to mark the approximate location of where the passenger went into the water, Martin said. CAMERON BURNELL/ FAIRFAX NZ \nIt's not uncommon for people to be lost overboard and they're not always rescued as this woman was. \nIt took about 15 minutes for the ship to completely turn around and make it back to the same area. \n\"By the time the ship made it back to the vicinity, all onlookers could see that both life rings were in fact empty - she hadn't made it to either one - no one could see her,\" Martin said. \nA zodiac-type life boat was then deployed from the ship to conduct a search. DAVID HALLETT/FAIRFAX NZ \nThe Sun Princess lost a passenger overboard in 2014. The 85-year-old's fall was caught by a CCTV camera. \n\"Passengers and crew alike were dotted around the ship at all vantage points, in the hopes of assisting to locate the lost woman. Ad Feedback \n\"It felt like a long time scanning the ocean, trying to differentiate between the thousands of random white caps, and perhaps an actual person.\" \nShortly after 4.30pm (7.30pm NZT) the woman was located by the zodiac vessel, hauled aboard and returned to Sun Princess. \nMartin captured the moment the woman was brought aboard the lifeboat, which he shared on Facebook. \nIn total, the woman was in the water for about 45 minutes. \nMartin said he didn't know who the woman was or how her recovery was going, \"other than to say that she's alive, and was extremely lucky to have been found\". \n\"The Sun Princess crew all did a phenomenal job,\" he said. \nIt was not clear how the woman came to be in the water. \nThe ship was expected to arrive in Noumea, New Caledonia on Sunday. \nSun Princess first set sail in 1995 and can accommodate 2000 guests, with almost 1000 crew. \nPrincess Cruises has not responded to requests for comment. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T04:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:19:55.998+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
