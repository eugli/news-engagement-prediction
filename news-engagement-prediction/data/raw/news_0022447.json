Indigenous elder says Australia Day debate must continue Read more \nThe motion for change, moved by the Greens senator Rachel Siewert, called for the Senate to acknowledge that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are the “first peoples of these lands and waters”, and that 26 January is a day of mourning for many.\nIt called for state and federal governments to change the date “so that all Australians can participate in celebrating this national day”.\nAfter the vote Siewert said she was disappointed her motion was not supported and that it showed a “disconnect” among senators.\n\n“All sides of parliament, particularly Labor, purport to advocate for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples,” she said. “In this instance, they have turned their back on them.\n“Moving Australia Day is not hard. True pride in this country is celebrating it on a day where everyone feels welcome. To celebrate it on a day that our first peoples are grieving remains nonsensical and insensitive.”\nIn a short debate on the motion, the Coalition Senator James McGrath said: “the government’s response is no.”\nThe Labor senator Katy Gallagher said Labor opposed the motion and “proudly celebrate our national day”.\nBut she added: “This did not mean forgetting our scars and the opposition understands that for many first Australians this day still carries much sadness, following many long years of injuries and indignities great and small.”\n\nThe Greens’ motion followed one from Williams, calling for the exact opposite, on Wednesday night.\n\nHe sought to have the Senate note that in 1946 the commonwealth and state governments set the date of 26 January, that award and citizenship ceremonies are held on that date across the country, and that a poll found that 68% of Australians felt positive about the date .\nInvasion Day will come to rival Anzac Day in years to come | Paul Daley Read more \nHis motion also included mention of “a number of protest marches were conducted which were organised by a group with links to the Greens and the unions”, and that a flag had been set alight. He accused the Greens senator Lee Rhiannon of saying she wanted more people to see the Greens as “radical and anti-establishment”.\nThe Greens leader, Richard Di Natale , spoke against Williams’ motion, and said Australia Day was “a day of dispossession” and should not be used to celebrate the country’s great history.\nDi Natale said burning the Australian flag was not “how you change hearts and minds” and his party did not like it, “but we sure as hell do not believe that people should be locked up for it”.\nHe added that the government should be wary of citing polls.\nGallagher said the opposition would not support Williams’ motion because it “amounted to a personal attack on individual senators”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T08:37:21.699+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
