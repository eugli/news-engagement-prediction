Unfortunately this misunderstanding is not only widespread but dangerous as well. Not only can African Americans or any person of color get sunburned everyone is at risk for skin cancer as well. African Americans and The Risk Of Getting A Sunburn \nWhen you think of people who get sunburned, you typically think of a pale, freckled person, not someone with black skin. But people with black skin can get a sunburn right along side their friend with pale skin. It’s true! Sure, it isn’t as easy to get a sunburn if you have dark skin verses fair skin, but the risk is still there. \nSkin color and tone is determined by cells in the outermost layer of our skin called melanocytes which produce melanin . Melanin is the pigment that gives both our skin and our eyes their color. Every human has the same number of melanocytes, our skin color is determined by the amount of melanin those cells produce. The more melanin produced the darker our skin color. \nDermatologists rank the risk of sunburn according to the Fitzpatrick scale : Type I: Pale white skin – always burns, never tans Type II: White skin – Burns easily, tans minimally Type III: White skin – Burns minimally, tans easily Type IV: Light brown or olive skin – Burns minimally, tans easily Type V: Brown skin – Rarely burns, tans easily and darkly Type VI: Dark brown or black skin – Rarely burns, always tans, deeply pigmented \nRe-read Type V and VI. Rarely, not never . People who fall into the types IV, V, and VI can look so different depending on many things, including nationality so if you don't know your where you fall on the Fitzpatrick scale ask your doctor or esthetician next time you see them. \nSo what does that mean for sunscreen and sun safety ? It means you aren’t immune to sunburn no matter what anyone tells you. Are you going to get a sunburn every time you’re in the sun? Probably not. Nevertheless sunscreen isn’t optional. Just because it is rare for African Americans to get sunburns doesn’t mean it won’t happen. \nSunburn on black skin looks different than sunburn on fair skin – the redness isn’t there so it isn’t as obvious to people that they have gotten a sunburn, but tightness, pain, skin that is hot to the touch and peeling later on are all indicators that you have or have had a sunburn. Getting just one blistering sunburn ups your chance of skin cancer . African Americans Can Get Skin Cancer \nAnother myth is that people with black skin cannot get skin cancer. This is flat-out wrong. There are multiple types of skin cancer, and yes, having black skin does make you less likely to get some of them, but you might be surprised to know that while it is rare for black people to get melanoma , those who do have it are more likely to die or get further complications from the disease. Did you know Bob Marley died of melanoma ? \nTypically melanoma shows itself on areas of the body that get regular sun exposure, but melanoma tends to show up in less-typical places in those with darker skin tones such as the palms of the hands, soles of the feet and the fingernail bed. Because of the misconception that black people can’t get skin cancer and because people aren’t informed that melanoma can arise in atypical locations in black skin, people are diagnosed later sometimes too late for treatment. Melanoma can be fatal if not treated early enough.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:33:53.632+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
