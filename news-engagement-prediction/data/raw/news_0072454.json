Cow keeps winning,\" Kansas City television reporter Brian Abel tweeted, using the acronym for the New York City Police Department. \nAfter more than two hours, the bull entered the backyard of a home in the Jamaica neighborhood, about 1.5 miles (2.4 km) from the slaughterhouse, and police sedated and captured it, said Sergeant Lee Jones, a police spokesman. \nIt was later declared dead, and although the cause was not immediately known, stress may have been a factor, Detective Ahmed Nasser said. The body was being sent to a crematorium on Long Island, he said. \nThe New York Post said the bull was shot with at least five tranquilizer darts by police before it died. \n(Reporting by David Ingram; Editing by Tom Brown) Next In Oddly Enough Thimble dropped from Monopoly board game after getting a thumbs-down \nBOSTON New versions of Monopoly will no longer give players the option of using a tiny silver-colored thimble as their pawn on the board, after fans voted to drop the piece that had featured in the game since its introduction in 1935.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:26:06.653+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
