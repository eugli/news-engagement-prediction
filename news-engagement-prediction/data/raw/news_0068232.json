That strategy came three years after the city of Gresham signed-off on a Boeing request that led to an $80 million investment in the site. In January 2016, Boeing said it \"continues to make investments in our facility for future production rate increases.\" This story will be updated. Pete Danko covers energy, manufacturing and ports.
