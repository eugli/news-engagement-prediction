Bars operational in several five-star hotels and resorts, located along the expressway, also fall within the red zone. \nOn December 15, the Supreme Court had ordered states and union territories across India to stop the sale of liquor within 500 metres of national and the state highways. \nBCCL \nThe Court has also instructed the police and administration of various states to devise the plan of the crackdown on bars and pubs operational alongside highways. \nHowever, the closure of the 43 liquor vends would cost the state coffers an amount of Rs 70.81 crore in revenue per year. Some pubs and bars in the Sector 29 market will also be affected. A number of such outlets are also located along Sohna Road. \n“We will comply with the orders of the Supreme Court. We have conducted a survey and will shortly submit the report to the headquarters,” Aruna Singh, deputy excise and taxation commissioner, Gurgaon told HT. \nBCCL \nPub owners in order to get some clarity on the matter are now mulling to meet the excise officials. “Restaurants are being targeted unjustifiably. A restaurant is the safest place for an individual to drink and at least more than three-and-a-half lakh employees face the risk of losing jobs,” said Arvind Kumar, general manager, The Wine Company. \n“Due to a lack of description in the ruling, all food and beverages outlets have come under the scanner. Let’s hope that the Supreme Court will explain this and give us a realistic guideline of the ruling,” Goumtesh Singh, owner, Raasta Cafe.
