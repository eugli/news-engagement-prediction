Comment on This Story Tom Fox/Staff Photographer Injured Dallas Cowboys rookie outside linebacker Jaylon Smith works out during a morning walk thru at training camp in Oxnard, California, Monday, August 13, 2016. (Tom Fox/The Dallas Morning News) By Jon Machota , Staff Writer Contact Jon Machota on Twitter: @jonmachota \nHOUSTON -- The 2016 NFL season is officially over. The Cowboys coaches will be back at The Star on Tuesday, already getting prepared for the 2017 season. \nSince they'll be looking ahead, we will too. \nHow does a 13-3 team go from losing in the divisional round to reaching Super Bowl 52? \nWe have the answers. \nHere are the five things the 2017 Cowboys need to do to be playing in Minneapolis next February. 1. Have good health \nEvery year this is No. 1 for me. One of the biggest reasons for the Cowboys' success in 2014 and 2016 was because of their good fortune in the health department, particularly on offense. Defensively, Sean Lee has finally reached his potential because he's been healthy the last two seasons. Dak Prescott, Ezekiel Elliott, Dez Bryant, Tyron Smith, etc. are going to deal with injuries, but they need to avoid the major setback that sidelines for a long period of time. It would also help to get a full 16 games out of DeMarcus Lawrence. A little luck would go a long way in this area. 2. Improve the pass rush Louis DeLuca/Staff Photographer Dallas Cowboys defensive tackle David Irving (95) and teammates Sean Lee (50), tackle Terrell McClain (97), Justin Durant (56) and Tyrone Crawford (98) swarm an Aaron Rodgers fumble in the second half during the Dallas Cowboys vs. the Green Bay Packers NFL football game at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on Sunday, October 16, 2016. (Louis DeLuca/The Dallas Morning News) \nNothing new here, and you're probably sick of hearing about it. The Cowboys just don't put enough pressure on opposing quarterbacks. It was the biggest reason for the loss to Green Bay in 2014 and it's the biggest reason they came up short against the Packers last month. How do they improve it over the next few months? Great question. Glad it was asked. Executive vice president Stephen Jones has made it clear: they aren't spending big in free agency, so any significant upgrades will have to come via the draft. Tough to do when you don't have a top 10 pick. The Cowboys could trade several valuable future picks to move up, kind of like Atlanta did to land Julio Jones. But don't hold your breath. Rod Marinelli needs more rushmen out of this draft. Will that be enough? Another good question. 3. More takeaways \nYes, another broken record here. The Cowboys increased that total number to 20 in 2016, which is basically middle of the pack. They forced only 11 in 2015. So there is improvement! The interceptions are where they are really hurting. Dallas' defense picked off only eight passes in 2015 and nine in 2016. Those numbers have to improve. More pressure up front would help, but the defensive backs also need to make more plays. No Dallas defensive back has had more than two interceptions over the last three seasons. 4. Big year from Jaylon Smith Tom Fox/Staff Photographer Dallas Cowboys rookie outside linebacker Jaylon Smith works on a resistance cord as he rehabs his knee injury from last season during a morning walk thru at training camp in Oxnard, California, Monday, August 15, 2016. (Tom Fox/The Dallas Morning News) \nThere have been several positive reports about the improvements Smith has made physically. He says he could've played in the playoffs. Others say that's a bit of a stretch. Either way, if he can return to the player he was in college, the Cowboys got the steal of the draft last year. A healthy Smith was worthy of a top five pick. At Notre Dame, he was a game-changing player that greatly impacted all areas. What a combination Matt Eberflus could be working with if he can pair Smith with Sean Lee. 5. Draft like it's 2016 \nWill McClay and Co. did very well in last year's draft. It could end up being one of the best classes in franchise history. It's unlikely they'll come away with as many impact players in 2017 but they need to fill a few important holes. Landing an impact pass rusher and starting cornerback obviously being at the top of that list. They found Dak Prescott in the fourth round and Anthony Brown in the sixth. Immediate impact can be added after the first three rounds. Improve the defense anywhere near as much as they improved the offense a year ago and the Cowboys will be in position to make a run next January. This Topic is Missing Your Voice.
