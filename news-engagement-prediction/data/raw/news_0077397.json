He said: “I did feel some of my colleagues may have been aggrieved that the enforcer of discipline was being somewhat ill-disciplined himself.” \nChristensen said he made the decision to resign because “my continued outspokenness on a variety of issues was obviously incompatible with the position of party whip in the long term”. \n“It was my decision to resign; and my decision alone. I was not pushed by anyone.” \nSome government MPs are concerned that Christensen’s departure from the whip’s role will remove an important structural check on the renegade backbencher’s behaviour, and could ultimately hasten his departure from the Coalition fold. \nThe government has already lost one of its number, the South Australian senator Cory Bernardi, who quit in the opening week of federal parliament to establish his new Australian Conservatives movement. Bernardi has made it clear he would welcome fellow travellers. \nA ReachTEL poll reported by the ABC earlier this week had One Nation level pegging with the LNP on primary votes in Dawson. The ReachTEL poll gave the LNP 30.4% of the vote, compared with 30% for One Nation, in the Queensland seat.
