Nearly 15 minutes into a joint press conference with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu , as Donald Trump called on another reporter clamoring to ask a question of both leaders, the president eased a bit, relaxing into himself. He let go of the grip he’d been holding on the lectern. The muscles in his face unclenched. It wasn’t because he was lobbed a softball. The opposite, really. A reporter asked the president about what he would say to Jewish people around the world who believe xenophobia and bigotry have risen alongside Trump’s own ascent to the White House. “Even after your victory,” the question began, “we’ve seen a sharp rise in anti-Semitic incidents across the United States.” (Trump’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon , previously turned Breitbart News into a gathering place for white nationalists and anti-Semites.) When Trump chimed in to answer, it was almost as if he heard nothing after “even after your victory.” What the reporter did was open the door for him to talk about that victory, and since the door was open, Trump did a victory lap right on through. “Well, I just want to say that we are very honored by the victory that we had—306 electoral college votes. We were not supposed to crack 220, you know that, right?” he asked, turning to Netanyahu. “There was no way to 221. But then they said there’s no way to 270.” Trump went on to say that there is “tremendous enthusiasm” for his agenda, in large part because the nation was so fractured, which he said helped propel him into the Oval Office. “We are going to have peace in this country,” he said. “We are going to stop crime in this country. We are going to do everything within our power to stop long-simmering racism and every other thing that's going on. One of the reasons I won the election is we have a very, very divided nation, very divided. Hopefully I’ll be able to do something about that. It’s something that was very important to me.” Trump thumping his chest about his electoral victories and vastness of his support at inappropriate times—moments during which he, as president, is meant to act, well, presidential—has become his thing in the four weeks since he has been in Washington. On the eve of his inauguration, at a candlelight dinner for Republican leadership and donors, he boasted about the electoral math. The day after the inauguration, he went on and on about the crowd size at his swearing-in ceremony at C.I.A. headquarters. His surrogates have, time and time again, trotted out the states they’d flipped from blue to red in November and the number of people who came out to cheer at rallies. It is a trope that, at best, makes them look like sore winners, and, at worst, unfocused, narcissistic, and out of touch with the reality that the first month of the Trump presidency has been marred by serious political chaos. Trump did circle back to the issue of how Jewish people feel in the end, though his answer did not do much to answer the question. And in true Trump fashion, his response had to do with himself and his direct relatives. “As far as people, Jewish people: so many friends, a daughter who happens to be here right now, a son-in-law, and three beautiful grandchildren,” he said. “I think that you’re going to see a lot different United States over the next three, four, or eight years. I think a lot of good things are happening and you're going to see a lot of love. You're going to see a lot of love. O.K.?” After a bitter relationship with the administration of President Barack Obama , Netanyahu has heralded Trump’s election as the restoration of Israel and the United States’s close bond. And so, on Wednesday, he was happy to try and help Trump shut the door on rumors of anti-Semitism. “I’ve known President Trump for many years . . . there is no greater support for Israel or the Jewish State than President Donald Trump,“ Netanyahu said. “I think we can put that to rest.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T03:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T13:32:55.976+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
