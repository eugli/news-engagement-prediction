No first come, first served,\" the Republican governor said. \"Just as we did with Tennessee Promise we’re making a clear statement to families with Reconnect: Wherever you might fall on life’s path, education beyond high school is critical to the Tennessee we can be.” Read more Free tuition at state colleges for qualifying residents - NY governor \nThe state already has a tuition free program for high school graduates and since its introduction in 2014, more than 33,000 high school students have entered community and technical colleges. Adults are next, Governor Haslam said . \nIn 2013, the governor launched an effort to increase the number of Tennesseans with post-secondary degrees or certificates to 55 percent by 2025 by offering high school graduates opportunities to attend community college for free. \nTo meet that challenge, 871,000 people need to get their post-secondary degrees or certificates. There are 900,000 adults in the state of 6.6 million that have some college but no degree. \nHaslam touted the program as not adding costs to the taxpayer and instead relying on money from a variety of sources, including federal Pell Grants and the state lottery, according Nashville Public Radio . \nOfficials expect the Reconnect scholarship would cost the state $10 million annually. The Tennessean reported the move is cementing “Haslam’s national reputation as a change agent in higher education.” \nOn the face of it, the program sounds like one straight out of the Democrats playbook, and Haslam’s efforts even caught the attention of former President Barack Obama who chose the state as the site for a speech about making community colleges tuition-free in early 2015. \nThe idea of providing free community college education has spread in recent years and Tennessee is one of three states with free community college programs - along with Oregon and Minnesota, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Kentucky approved a similar program last year, while other states are considering their own programs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T06:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:30:12.905+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
