If they have to go for a follow-up (examination), it is necessary that they do so,” he said. \nJong-nam was at the KLIA2 at 8am on Feb 13 to board a flight to Macau an hour later when two women suddenly appeared before him and wiped his face with the palms of their hands which contained a poisonous liquid. \nJong-nam sought help at a customer service counter at the airport and was rushed to the Putrajaya Hospital but died on the way. He had come to Malaysia on Feb 6 and carried a passport bearing the name Kim Chol. \nThe police had arrested two women - one bearing an Indonesian passport and the other a Vietnamese passport - and two men, one a Malaysian and the other a North Korean, following the murder. \nAsked about the risk of any airline passenger having come into contact with the nerve agent on Feb 13, Abdul Samah said the effect would have been known much earlier. \n“So far, we have not received any report from anybody with regard to this case,” he said. \nAsked about reports that one of the women suspects had vomitted following the incident, Abdul Samah said she had vomitted in a taxi as she headed to another location. \n“She did not vomit in police custody,” he said. \nQuestioned about the North Korean suspect, Abdul Samah said his remand was extended yesterday for seven more days. \nOn the samples reportedly taken by police from a condominium in Jalan Klang Lama, Kuala Lumpur, he said the condominium was believed to have been rented by four suspects who left the country on the day of the killing. \n- Bernama \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T10:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T05:09:34.990+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
