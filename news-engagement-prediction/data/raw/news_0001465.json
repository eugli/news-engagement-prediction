Story continues below \n“The agency cancelled it. The cancellation has gone through and the money hasn’t been transferred yet and there’s nothing [the airline] can do. I was devastated,” Gill said. \nBina Gill’s brother had a flight scheduled Jan. 25 but found out his tickets were cancelled when he got to the airport. \n“While they’re checking in the agent there said, ‘oh, the two tickets have been refunded for the boys.’ So the parents had two tickets and the kids didn’t have any booking.” \nIn both cases, they bought four tickets, but only the ones paid in cash were cancelled. \nTropical Travel World on Westwinds Drive N.E. is closed and a sign on the door lists an emergency number but the voicemail is full. \nGlobal News has learned after clients paid Tropical for their flights, the tickets were booked through another travel agency. But that agency was never paid and cancelled the flights. \nTravel agents and agencies in Alberta aren’t regulated like other provinces and don’t have to be licensed. \nThere is a professional organization which sets standards for the industry and it has been lobbying for more consumer protection. \n“There’s no guarantee that you walk into a shop that calls themselves a travel agency, that they have the ability to book tickets for you,” said Barbara Sutherland, the regional director for the Association of Canadian Travel Agencies. \nWhile travel agencies don’t have to be ACTA members, she says consumer should know there are differences. \n“If they’re an ACTA agency, the consumer can know that this agency is incorporated, does have business insurance, it does have errors and omission insurance and they are with International Air Transport Association (IATA).” \nBoth Manpreet and Bina Gill’s brother had to buy new tickets and rebook flights. \nThey aren’t sure if they’ll ever see their money and plan to use credit cards from now on. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T08:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T06:47:24.691+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
