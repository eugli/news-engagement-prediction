And even if they did - that wouldn't necessarily help them win voter support.\nLabour are tanking in the polls L abour have fallen well behind the Conservatives in recent opinion polls with the latest Guardian/ICM results showing the gap extending to 18 points, with the Tories on 44 per cent to Labour's 26 per cent. \nMr Corbyn was confronted about the figures as he addressed the weekly meeting of the parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) last night ahead of crucial by-elections in Copeland and Stoke Central .\nChris Leslie , the former Shadow Chancellor, asked Mr Corbyn if he \"had any comprehension\" of what the figures meant for Labour's election chances. \nTo which Mr Corbyn replied: \"Of course I understand what's going on and the problems we have had in the media.\n\"We need to get a strong, positive message across and we do that better on social media.\"\nWatch | Tom Watson: Jeremy Corbyn \"has to improve\" 01:16 Are Labour better on social media? A Telegraph analysis of the reach of prominent Labour politicians on Twitter compared to their Conservative counterparts goes some way to disproving Jeremy Corbyn's assertions.\nWe looked at the Twitter accounts of 13 of the most prominent shadow cabinet members and weighed up how many followers they have and how much engagement they got on the social platform with their latest tweets compared to their opposite numbers in Government.*\nBased purely on the number of followers each account had at the time of extraction, the members of the cabinet emerged 9-4 victors.\nCorbyn has more followers than Theresa May, while Diane Abbott saw off Amber Rudd, John McDonnell beat Philip Hammond and Keir Starmer edged out David Davis.\nBut otherwise, the Government enjoyed a clean sweep of the board.\nScores were more mixed when it came to engagement, with the Shadow Cabinet winning 7-6 based on the number of retweets an average tweet received but losing 8-5 on favourites. \nBut isn't it unfair to compare raw numbers of retweets and favourites? Generally speaking, it's of limited use to compare raw figures in the way that we have above without weighting them against some other measure to make the comparison fairer.\nFor instance, America is likely to produce more Olympic medalists than the UK because it has a larger population. In the same way, a person with more followers is more likely to get more retweets and favourites than somebody with fewer followers.\nIndeed, when weighting against the number of followers each politician had, the Labour shadow cabinet members performed much better.\nOf the 13 shadow vs cabinet match-ups, the shadow cabinet emerged 10-3 victors based on retweets per follower and 8-5 winners on the average number of favourites per follower.\nB ut herein lies the crux of the problem when considering the Labour party's poor performances in the polls.\nUnder Corbyn, Labour have veered to the left of the political spectrum, appealing to a very vocal but small hardcore of support. They don't appeal to those who aren't predisposed to agree with them and, consequently, they aren't winning any voters back from the Conservatives or from UKIP.\nThis situation is magnified on social media where, due to a mixture of algorithms and personal choice, users are far less likely to encounter views that differ substantially to their own.\nJeremy Corbyn's audience on social media are, therefore, naturally more likely to agree with him and positively receive his messages. Those that would naturally disagree with him - those voters who Corbyn needs to win over to have a chance in an election - are far less likely to see his messages.\nFor a man doing so poorly as leader of his party it must be tempting to seek solace in the comfort blanket of a social media bubble, but it won't do his chances of remaining leader or gaining power any good.\nShadow minister resignations under Corbyn *We only included those positions where both the cabinet and shadow cabinet members had Twitter accounts. This meant we had to miss out well known politicians such as Tom Watson and Sir Michael Fallon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:49:05.479+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
