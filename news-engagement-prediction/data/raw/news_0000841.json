SLOTNIK   Photo John Wetton in ’82. His music interest sparked by his brother’s organ playing in church. Credit Paul Natkin/Getty Images John Wetton, a bass player, vocalist and songwriter who adapted the dense, progressive rock he performed with bands like King Crimson into mainstream hits with the supergroup Asia in the early 1980s, died on Tuesday near his home in Bournemouth, England. He was 67. His manager, Martin Darvill, said the cause was colon cancer. A technically adept bassist with a smooth tenor voice, Mr. Wetton came up musically in London in the late 1960s and early ’70s. He was part of a cohort of musicians, in groups like Pink Floyd and Yes, who were known for an ornate, maximalist brand of rock. King Crimson, founded in 1968, was another such band, and Mr. Wetton joined an incarnation of it in 1972, playing alongside the group’s original guitarist, Robert Fripp, the drummer Bill Bruford, formerly of Yes, and others. He appeared on the group’s albums “ Larks’ Tongues in Aspic ” (1973), “ Starless and Bible Black ” (1974) and “Red” (1974). King Crimson - Red (8-bit) Video by Eduardo Augusto Mr. Fripp disbanded the group in the mid-1970s, when it appeared to be on the brink of reaching a wider audience. “I didn’t understand Robert’s reasons then,” Mr. Wetton said in 1999, “and I still don’t.” Mr. Wetton went on to perform with groups like Roxy Music, Uriah Heep and U.K. before forming Asia in 1981 with the drummer Carl Palmer, of Emerson, Lake and Palmer, and the guitarist Steve Howe and the keyboardist Geoff Downes, both of Yes. Asia’s sound was more accessible than the bandmates’ earlier endeavors, and the group became an instant success after the release of its debut album, titled simply “Asia,” in 1982. The group’s single “Heat of the Moment” reached No. 4 on the Billboard chart. With melodious three-part harmony on its chorus, it has often been compared to anthems like Journey’s “ Don’t Stop Believing ” and Boston’s “ More Than a Feeling .” Another Asia single, “ Only Time Will Tell ” reached No. 17. “Asia” sold millions of copies, and the band was soon playing stadium shows. Audiences were thrilled; critics were often underwhelmed. “In Yes, early King Crimson and Emerson, Lake and Palmer, Asia’s members played music full of technical hurdles and symphonic pomp,” Jon Pareles wrote in reviewing a 1983 concert in The New York Times. “Soon groups like Kansas and Styx picked up on the pomp, minus any experiments. Asia imitates the imitators, inflating conventional pop songs with pseudosymphonic grandeur.” Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.
