Photo: AP \nDemocrats are dithering. Angry in defeat, their progressive base is demanding that they lash out – but Democratic senators are in several minds, eager to avenge the Republican humiliation of Obama in denying his constitutional right to appoint a judge last year, but wary of goading the GOP by opting for political theatre that will not change the outcome. \nThe call that Democrat Senate leader Chuck Schumer is trying to make is to let the confirmation process proceed or, as the Republicans did when Obama nominated Merrick Garland, to stonewall from the get-go. \n\"There's no doubt what they did [on Garland] was wrong and unconstitutional. In the end, I don't think we should play their game. Have a hearing and vote,\" said Jon Tester, a senator from Montana who is one of the Democrats at risk in the midterm elections. \nBut then there's this from Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown: \"[GOP Senate leader] Mitch McConnell stole a Supreme Court seat from the US and if Trump wanted to bring the country together … he would nominate Merrick Garland and say he's middle of the road.\" \nSo why all the fuss - why is such a seemingly simply rule change likened to a nuclear detonation? Well, because this is not how the Senate is supposed to conduct itself. \nAs The Washington Post describes it: \"It would be about forever changing the nature of the Senate, which the founders set up with the express goal to slow down and cool off the hasty and heated impulses more common in the House\". \nThat arrangement gives senators enormous and at times, it must be said, absurd power over the administration. But senators historically have been jealous of their power to go off into the weeds, as they see fit. \nThe theory behind the filibuster is that it forces considered debate in which the majority party is required to compromise as needed to get members of the other party to support their position, thereby achieving laws that are more stable because they are based on bipartisan support – like the groundbreaking 1964 Civil Rights Act , which got through on the votes of 27 Republicans and 44 Democrats in the face of a filibuster by Southern senators. \nSo even as it inches into a cataclysmic battle on the Gorsuch appointment, individual senators on both sides are walking away from their party colleagues. \nJoe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, a state Trump won by 42 points, doesn't even bother with the pretense of wanting to stall the Gorsuch appointment – a strong believer in executive authority, he told reporters: \"I'm not a filibuster-type guy\". \nAnd on Monday, Susan Collins, a Republican senator from Maine, told reporters: \"I am not a proponent of changing the rules of the Senate – I hope that common sense will prevail and that we will have a normal process for considering this nominee.\" \nWhite House insiders are letting it be known that another element in the selection of Gorsuch was his service as a young lawyer as a clerk to the swinging vote judge Kennedy. \nAmidst speculation that Kennedy might be reluctant to retire lest the bench be stacked with hard-right conservatives, the Trump calculus was that appointing Gorsuch would be a message to Kennedy that he could go quietly into the night, in the knowledge that someone he knows is on board – thereby giving Trump another vacancy to fill. \nIronically, Gorsuch was a classmate of Obama's at Harvard Law School. But he's conservative – his decisions have backed the right of employers who, for religious reasons, objected to laws requiring the inclusion of contraception in workplace health insurance schemes and he has rebuked liberals for going to the courts, not the legislature, to settle policy issues. \nEspecially dear to Republican hearts and minds is Gorsuch's reputation as an \"originalist\" – that's a judicial school whose interpretation of the Constitution by what is reckoned to be the understanding of those who drafted it centuries ago, favours conservative law-making.
