On Wednesday the city will launch its One Book, One New York program, in which residents of all five boroughs will be urged to read the same book starting in early March. Photo Credit Sonny Figueroa/The New York Times During February, New Yorkers will vote on which book to read, choosing from these five finalists: Ta-Nehisi Coates’s “Between the World and Me,” Paul Beatty’s “The Sellout,” Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s “Americanah,” Betty Smith’s “A Tree Grows in Brooklyn” and Junot Díaz’s “The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao.” Julie Menin, the commissioner of the Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment, the agency in charge of the program, said the city government wasn’t involved when a similar project ran aground in 2002. “The group couldn’t agree on a book, which is an only-in-New-York moment,” she said. “That became a cautionary tale, and we weren’t going to have the same problem.” In addition to speaking with officials in other cities that have pulled off the concept — including Chicago, Philadelphia and Seattle — New York officials asked an advisory panel made up of heads of public libraries, publishers, academics and others to suggest possible books. They winnowed that list down to five, and now the public will vote. The main voting mechanism will be online . In addition, readers will be able to vote on the interactive digital kiosks now in many subway stations. Photo In a climate in which Staten Island has one independent bookstore and the Bronx has none, Ms. Menin said there was a “real economic development message in this, to promote independent bookstores. By having a shortlist of five books, it hopefully encourages people to read all five books before they vote. And to buy them. We want to be very supportive of these industries.” Lisa Lucas, the executive director of the National Book Foundation, expressed excitement about the One Book plan, but also said she hoped this was just one small step in more robust support for the publishing world. Ms. Menin’s office has only recently been charged with working with the publishing industry, and Ms. Lucas, who has previous experience in the world of film, praised the way that the agency has “changed the way film works in this city,” providing “incentives to keep business in the city, and to make sure businesses were thriving.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “That office has a really huge opportunity to think about how to encourage book stores to open; to think about tax incentives,” Ms. Lucas said. “Let’s get everybody reading, and then let’s get these businesses that help people do that flourishing. Anything that promotes reading is wonderful, and I just look forward to it as a steppingstone.” Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.
