A federal judge temporarily blocked the directive nationwide last year. \nThe Obama administration asked that the directive only be put on hold in the 13 states while it appealed. A hearing on that request was set for Tuesday, but Friday’s filing asked that the hearing be cancelled, saying the parties are “currently considering how best to proceed in this appeal.” \n(© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.
