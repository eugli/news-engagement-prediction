Based on our own experiences, we anticipate many of our patients will lose their health insurance based on pre-existing conditions or income levels if the ACA is revoked. The consequences of the repeal will likely result in limited access to preventative health screening, diagnostic testing, specialist care and potentially lifesaving treatments. The stories of those whose health has been salvaged by the ACA are all around us, but they are often invisible. \nWe write to advocate for the core components of ACA that protect our patients, and hence should be included in any replacement plan: the expansion of Medicaid, access to preventative care and protection for pre-existing conditions. \nWe recognize that the ACA is not perfect, but it has enabled many vulnerable patients with limited health care access to be a part of the larger health care system. The number of uninsured people in Pennsylvania has fallen by 37 percent since the ACA was enacted in 2010, translating to almost a half-million Pennsylvanians who now have access to health care, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. \nOf these hundreds of thousands of people, we have been fortunate to encounter many who are now able to see a physician. One woman with diabetes had not seen a doctor or taken medication for years due to lack of coverage, inflicting untold damage to her heart, kidneys and nerves. Another patient had worried for months about an enlarging breast mass and was incredibly relieved to get the appropriate evaluation. Like many in our community, a recovering heroin user with a large thyroid mass was just thankful he could finally see a physician and get the care he needed. \nWe’ve heard stories about multigenerational families who had been treating their elders for severe chronic conditions at home, and now were elated that they could receive real medical attention. We’ve talked to women who could now afford contraception and have more control over their family lives. We’ve seen patients struggling with depression, suicidality and chronic pain who now can stop self-medicating and receive proper and highly desired care. \nOnly time will tell what effect expanding access to care has made on the health outcomes of large populations. But for many individuals, it has clearly had an immediate impact on their personal health and well-being. We have been fortunate to witness the transition of many of our patients from intermittent, spotty care at free clinics to access to the full range of medical services, including a primary care physician, annual exams, preventative health screening and necessary specialists. Our relationships as physicians with some of these newly enrolled patients, and the opportunity to work with them to improve their health, have been some of the most rewarding experiences in our medical careers. \nRecognizing that the ACA is imperfect and has room for improvement, we as physicians appeal for health care reform that does not take one step forward and two steps backward. For the welfare of our patients, we plead for a replacement plan that retains the positive aspects of the ACA, while working to improve deficiencies and economical feasibility. \nSo, if you have personal stories of how the ACA has improved your health or the lives of your loved ones, we encourage you to call our senators and representatives. It is through our collective voices that we can preserve the recent advances in access to health care and work together to continue to improve the health and well-being of our United States of America. \nIn addition to Dr. Molly Ainsman Fisher, nine local doctors have signed this op-ed: Dr. Etsemaye Agonafer, Dr. Christopher D’avella, Dr. Natasha Kassim, Dr. Amy Kennedy, Dr. Amy Lu, Dr. Anita Lyons, Dr. Benjamin Sprague, Dr. Anam Waheed and Dr. Margaret Zupa.
