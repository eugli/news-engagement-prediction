No charges were filed. \nIn his reaction to those developments and several other issues of contention between the two parties, Mr. Usman said his visit was to turn a new leaf in the relationship and communication management between PREMIUM TIMES’ journalists and the military authorities. Army Spokesperson, Brigadier-General Sani Usman with PREMIUM TIMES Publisher, Dapo Olorunyomi and Editor-in-Chief, Musikiliu Mojeed \nArmy Spokesperson, Brigadier-General Sani Usman with PREMIUM TIMES Publisher, Dapo Olorunyomi and Editor-in-Chief, Musikiliu Mojeed \nHe blamed past disagreements on “communication gap” and described it as an “unfortunate” situation. \nIn his reaction, Musikilu Mojeed, the Editor-in-Chief, said PREMIUM TIMES greatly appreciates the efforts of the Nigerian Army in fostering peace and unity in a diverse entity like Nigeria amidst unprecedented security challenges. \n“At no time in our history has the Nigerian Army faced an unconventional war of this magnitude,” Mr. Mojeed said of the threat posed by Boko Haram. “If there’s no peace and security, PREMIUM TIMES, as indeed most businesses in this country will not have a conducive atmosphere to operate.” \nMr. Mojeed, however, noted that PREMIUM TIMES had done a lot to project the image of Nigerian Army as a capable and professional organisation. Army Spokesperson, Brigadier-General Sani Usman \nHe urged the leadership of the Army, and indeed the entire military, to understand that PREMIUM TIMES would never abandon its responsibility of holding officials accountable and advocating for good treatment for our troops. \n“Once we understand each other’s constitutional roles, and responsibilities to society, there will be little or no conflict,” Mr. Mojeed said. \nMr. Usman concluded by saying that the “Nigerian Army has never been this transparent with information” and urged PREMIUM TIMES to be more considerate in its reportage. \n“PREMIUM TIMES is a credible medium and whatever you publish will be taken as gospel truth by many,” he said. \nFor this reason, he urged editors of the paper to show understanding and exercise restraint while reporting sensitive operational challenges of the army. Army Spokesperson, Brigadier-General Sani Usman with PREMIUM TIMES Publisher, Dapo Olorunyomi and Editor-in-Chief, Musikiliu Mojeed \nThe Managing Editor, Idris Akinbajo, and Assistant Managing Editors Ini Ekott and Bisi Abidoye, were also present at the meeting. So also were the paper’s Deputy Head, Digital Strategy and Technology, Richard Akinwumi, and Head, Innovation and Knowledge, Joshua Olufemi.
