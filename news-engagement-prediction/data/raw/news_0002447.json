The expedited hearings were started in 2014 to deal with increasing numbers of people fleeing Central America, in hopes of deterring additional migration. But the policy was largely viewed as a failure in that regard, as even more people from that region sought relief in the past two years than in 2014. The reversal this week was a rare occasion for advocates to cheer the Trump administration after two weeks of moves they decried. “This is a good thing,” said Bryan Johnson, an immigration lawyer in New York. “They are going back to common sense.” The reversal, explained in a memo from the country’s chief immigration judge, MaryBeth Keller, to judges nationwide, said the change would let the courts focus more on immigrants in detention centers who are awaiting deportation hearings, a costly population and a higher priority for the government. Families and children applying for asylum are usually not detained while their cases are being considered. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Lauren Alder, a spokeswoman for the Executive Office for Immigration Review, the arm of the Justice Department that oversees the immigration courts, said the new policy reflected “the present state of the immigration system,” adding that changes in court practices “should not be interpreted as long-term solutions to fix the broken system, but are short-term solutions to manage the growing caseload.” While they applauded the change in policy, some immigration advocates also interpreted it as a bid to clear the dockets for an anticipated increase in deportations under President Trump, who has promised a more restrictive approach to immigration. Since taking office on Jan. 20, he has signed orders that threatened to punish cities that do not collaborate with federal efforts to identify undocumented immigrants, paused refugee resettlement and temporarily suspended immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The Obama administration’s “rocket docket” approach was an attempt to deal with a flood of border crossings, many of them unaccompanied minors arriving without parents. Under the policy, those seeking asylum and other forms of relief would have their cases decided within months, rather than years. The policy was widely criticized by advocates who felt it unrealistic to expect children and parents fleeing violence to prepare asylum cases — which are among the most complex immigration cases — within months. Immigration courts, unlike criminal courts, do not confer the right to legal representation. Those who go before immigration judges must pay for their own lawyers or seek help from a limited number of pro bono representatives. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
