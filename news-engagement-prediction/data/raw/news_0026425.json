Higbie was among President Trump's first official surrogates on the campaign trail. (Carl Higbie via Twitter) \n\"We've done it based on race, we've done it based on religion, we've done it based on region. We've done it with Iran back — back a while ago. We did it during World War II with Japanese,\" Higbie told former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly in November after she pointed out that a registry based on religion could trigger widespread abuse. \nPresident-elect Trump had at the time floated the idea that American Muslims should be registered. \nMore than 110,000 Americans of Japanese descent were forcibly relocated and incarcerated in internment camps after the Japanese Empire attacked the Pearl Harbor naval base on Dec. 7, 1941. The camps marked a dark moment in American history and the Carter administration concluded in 1980 that they were caused by racism, not sound political policy. More than 110,000 Americans of Japanese descent were forcibly relocated and incarcerated in internment camps during World War II.

(Carolyn Kaster/AP) \n\"I've even talked to Carl personally and he even said it was not true,\" the spokeswoman said. \nNumerous reports have come out in recent weeks suggesting that President Trump has been unhappy with Spicer's performance as press secretary, and even regrets picking him. \nThe White House has blasted the reports as inaccurate.
