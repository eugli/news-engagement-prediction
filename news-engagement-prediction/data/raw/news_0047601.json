JUST WATCHED Badly damaged artifacts were smuggled out of Syrian city of Palmyra for safekeeping Antiquities expert who saved them from ISIS was killed by the militant group Italian restorers have worked to repair the statues using a 3D printer (CNN) Two sculptures from the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra, disfigured by ISIS fighters armed with hammers, have been painstakingly repaired by Italian restoration experts. The funerary busts of a man and a woman were among a trove of artifacts spirited out of Palmyra by Khalid al-As'ad, the site's head of antiquities, in an attempt to save them from complete destruction as ISIS terrorists occupied the region in 2015. Al-As'ad's refusal to reveal where he had hidden the priceless carvings cost the 82-year-old university professor his life: he was publicly beheaded by militants in the city's main square in August 2015. Damaged by ISIS militants in Palmyra, the sculptures were taken to Italy to be repaired. Italy's former minister of culture, Francesco Rutelli, organized the transportation of the two statues from Damascus, via Beirut, to Rome, where experts set to work restoring them. The busts, which date back to the second and third century, are now on display with replicas of other damaged artifacts from Syria and Iraq in a UNESCO-sponsored exhibition at Rome's Coliseum. Read More ISIS destroys Palmyra's Arch of Triumph 3-D printed repair work \"Italy wanted to maintain the request of the martyr of Palmyra, Khaled al-As'ad, who refused to collaborate with terrorists,\" Rutelli said. Now head of the cultural heritage organization Meeting of Civilizations Association, Rutelli said ISIS had \"ravaged [Palmyra's] museums with the purpose to destroy.\" The ancient carvings were repaired using nylon powder and a 3-D printer. Antonio Iaccarino, from Equilibrarte, the organization which carried out the repairs with Rome's Central Restoration Institute, explained the new techniques used in the work. \"In the past, in a restoration process like this one, the entire damaged area would have been removed and reconstructed. In our case, we did not modify the original part of the sculpture in any way,\" he said. ISIS militants armed with hammers left the priceless statues severely damaged. Reassembled elements of the statue were created by mirroring the artifact using nylon powder and then stamping them with a 3-D printer, Iaccarino said. Why ISIS wants to erase Palmyra's history 'Erasing the act of violence' \"When I saw the destruction for the first time, I was hit with such distress,\" said Daria Montemaggiori, another of the restorers. \"You could see the wickedness to eliminate, erase the human image. Seeing this, I was emotionally charged. The work of restoration allows us to erase the act of violence.\" ISIS has brought destruction to Palmyra -- one of Syria's most important historic sites -- since it took control of the oasis city in 2015. Many of the city's irreplaceable monuments and antiquities have been razed.

Syrian forces retook the city days before, but damage had already been done by ISIS. UNESCO says it plans to evaluate the extent of Palmyra's damage soon. Many of the structures -- which date from the first and second centuries and marry Greco-Roman techniques with local traditions and Persian influences -- remain in place, bolstering hopes that ISIS didn't completely raze the world heritage site.

Palmyra: Which ancient treasures did ISIS destroy? Having completed their mission in this particular case, Rutelli said the plan is to one day return the salvaged sculptures to their rightful places in Palmyra. \"The sculptures will be brought back to Damascus, eventually, they will return to Palmyra when it is safe,\" he said. \"These are the only pieces of art that have left the conflict areas of Syria and Iraq legally,\" he said. \"But they left with the purpose to be restored and then returned to their origin.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:24:20.199+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
