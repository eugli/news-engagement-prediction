Great cast all around! Masterpiece by Steve29 I think most movies out today are not very good compared to previous decades and I’m not that old at 43, but while I was watching this there were a few times when I got that twinge of yep this will be considered one of the best films of the decade. It had the same complex characters on both sides of the law that we saw in films like Heat, which is one of my all-time faves. What was also great about this was the pacing of it made you feel like you it was set to the same odometer as Bridges’s sheriff but also the Texas lifestyle. This movie did everything No Country For Old Men was trying to do but better. Better suspense, better pacing, better characters, better humor. Great movie", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T10:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T07:01:18.881+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
