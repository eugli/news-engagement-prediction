And now Shirley decides that it’s time that Whitney took a step back from him. \nWith everything getting on top of Mick, he has been terrified of losing the business and his freedom as a jail sentence hangs over him if he can’t pay off the fine. \nAs Mick hits the bottle, Whitney tries to help him out with his problems and, while her idea leaves Mick embarrassed, she opens up to him over her desperation to put things right, feeling that she is the cause of all of the trouble. (Picture: BBC) \nVulnerable Mick breaks down while they talk but it remains to be seen whether the two emotional characters will share another kiss – or even more. \nRegardless of where things stop, Shirley decides to do some damage limitation and warns Whitney to back off from Mick. (Picture: BBC) \nBut how will Mick and Whitney react to this? And is Shirley right to be concerned? \nOne to watch: Thursday 9th March at 7:30pm on BBC One. Metro Blogs is a place for opinions.
