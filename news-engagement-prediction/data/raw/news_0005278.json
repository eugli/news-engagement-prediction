A young shaper named Jon Pyzel , a Californian transplanted to the North Shore, was mowing foam at Country Surfboards, what he calls “the best located surfboard factory ever built,” right across the street from Sunset Beach. \nOne day, a young mother named Alex Florence came into the shop with three boys. \n“They were probably one, three and five years old. She came looking for me and asked if I could make her kid a board,” Jon Pyzel tells GrindTV. \nIt was for her eldest, a skinny little kid who you now know as John John Florence . You’ve likely heard of his brothers too, Nathan and Ivan. \nJohn John has four titles at the Volcom Pipeline Pro (which happens to be going on this week), the 24-year-old recently won the Quiksilver in Memory of Eddie Aikau, took the Surfer Poll Award, released the acclaimed “View from a Blue Moon” film, and is currently the WSL World Champion.

I think I had her just pay for the materials, probably less than $200. At that point, it was a lot of money for her and a fair bit for me,” Pyzel tells GrindTV. \nFive-year-old John John was riding a used 5’2″ board. \n“I made him his first custom. It was a 4’6″. I had no idea how to make a 4’6″. Who does? I shaped it, airbrushed it, and glassed it. I had to cut down some fins and glass them on,” Pyzel says. \nAlex was happy with the board and ordered a few more. \n“I stopped charging her. I couldn’t afford to be making free boards but I had a feeling about this kid,” he says. \nRecently, Pyzel’s daughter was going through some of his stuff and found a book that he used to keep detailed notes on every board he shaped. That first board he made for John John was the 105th board he’d ever shaped. Florence and Pyzel celebrate in Portugal when he clinched his world title.

He started seeing John John in the water at places like Gums and Gas Chambers. \n“By the time he was like eight or nine, we used to push him into some heavier waves. He was so light, you’d just push the tail of his board and sling him into it. There were so many times that I was nervous. I’d be like, ‘are you sure.’ And he was always like, ‘yeah, yeah!’ At least I knew if he ate it, his mom wasn’t going to be mad at me,” Pyzel says. \nAnd today, with John John on top of the surfing world, Pyzel couldn’t be any more proud. \n“As a person, I just see him dealing with what he deals with and he handles it so well. He’ll be outside his house and its like he’s a minor celebrity,” Pyzel tells GrindTV. “It’s not like a Kelly Slater level thing, but people line up to have their photo with him on the bike path. Or anytime I’ve traveled with him I see it. He really cares about people. He does a good job of making sure people are happy.” \nFlorence surfs the Volcom Pipe Pro (waiting period from Jan. 29-Feb. 10) and will work to defend his world title at the first World Championship Tour event of 2017 at the Gold Coast Pro, March 14-25.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T14:58:44.545+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
