This year marks the highest number of available jobs in five years, and application season is in full swing. Image: Yle \nDespite summer being months away, application season for summer jobs is in full swing. Luckily for applicants, a record number of summer jobs are available this year. \nAccording to a survey by the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK), a fifth of businesses are increasing the amount of available summer jobs this year. This year marks the highest number of available jobs in five years. \nEK plans to increase summer jobs amongst its members to 100,000 jobs – 10,000 more than last year. \nSpecialist Jenni Ruokonen from EK says the goal is a realistic one. \n“The economy is cheering up a bit, and that is reflected on the job market. Thanks to growing demand, businesses are finally able to hire more summer employees again,” Ruokonen says. \nThe sector to employ the most workers this year is trade. Stores are expected to employ 25,000 workers this summer. \n“The businesses with the most growth are in construction, research, design and consulting, as well as in the travel and restaurant industries,” Ruokonen says. Image: Yle Uutisgrafiikka Wanted: a good attitude \nRecruitment manager Kaisa Merentie at Restel, the leading hotel and restaurant company in Finland, says the company is planning to increase their summer employee intake by 25 percent. \n“We’re looking for chefs, waiters and service station employees,” Merentie says. \nPetteri Vitikainen from Cumulus Hotels says that while the demand for summer employees is on the rise, so is the competition for good employees. \n“Finding suitable people is big challenge. Especially good restaurant staff is hard to find especially in the Helsinki metropolitan region due to high living expenses.\" \nVitikainen says that employers have to make themselves as appealing as possible, as competition is fierce. \nBurger King’s regional manager Elina Hautala says the restaurant chain is constantly on the lookout for new employees. \nThe chain started looking for summer workers this week, and Hautala says the next few months will be hectic. The chain is looking for a total of 300 summer workers. \n“Young people should keep their eyes peeled. The best jobs are up for grabs right now, as we need to leave enough time to train new staff for the summer. Previous work experience isn’t absolutely necessary. What counts is a good attitude,” Hautala says. Sources", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T00:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T01:20:28.495+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
