By Richard Tanner PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 22:30, Fri, Feb 24, 2017 \nHerrera is a great student of the game and it comes as no surprise when he reveals he asks the veteran Swedish striker for tips on how to prolong his own career. \nZlatan Ibrahimovic , at 35, has made more appearances for Manchester United than any other player this season. Tomorrow’s EFL Cup final – when he will be chasing the 31st trophy of his remarkable career - will be his 38th game of the campaign and the 830th for club and country. \n“He is a strange case, a one-off,” said midfielder Herrera, who is eight years his junior. “When he takes his shirt off and you see his body, he looks 28 or 29. \n“Sometimes, I ask him what he is doing to continue to play the way he is doing because this is something I’d like to copy. \n“He is so lucky with his DNA and we are so lucky because we have him and hopefully we can enjoy him for a long time.” GETTY Ander Herrera wants to emulate Zlatan Ibrahimovic's longevity in the game GETTY Zlatan Ibrahimovic has won titles in Spain, France and Italy \nWhile Herrera marvels at Ibrahimovic’s athleticism and flexibility – Jose Mourinho puts it down to his martial arts training when he was younger – he believes his strutting presence and vast experience unsettles opponents. \n“It was fantastic to get him because sometimes the opponents are scared of him and the rest of us take advantage of that,” he said. “We get more space, more second ball. We have one of the best in the world. \n“He is the target for us. He has great height, he holds the ball up and he has the fantasy to resolve the play like he did.” \nHerrera’s fellow Spaniard Juan Mata says Ibrahimovic is also a key figure for the dressing room. \n“He’s a real character,” said Mata. “He has a strong personality and he’s funny. He speaks to the young players, he likes the banter and that’s good because football can be too serious.” GETTY Juan Mata said Ibrahimovic has a strong influence in the dressing room \nFormer United player Steve Bruce likens Ibrahimovic to Eric Cantona, the pied piper for the Class of 92. \n“The similarities between him and Cantona are scary. Both are born winners and Zlatan has that arrogance and way about him that Eric did. \n“You can see he is a bit of a talisman for every team he plays for and there is no talk about rest even at his age – he’s in terrific shape. For 35, he really is quite remarkable. He still has that hunger and desire to the best player.” \nHerrera himself is hoping to continue his happy memories of Wembley. The former Athletic Bilbao player has won on all four of his previous visits to the national stadium – but is in line to make his first start tomorrow. \nHe came on as a substitute in United’s FA Cup semi-final victory over Everton last season, then was an unused sub as Louis van Gaal’s team lifted the trophy in May. He came off the bench again in the Community Shield win over Leicester in August and also for Spain in their win over England in November.
