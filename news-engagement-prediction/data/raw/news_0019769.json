And doesn't she know it. \nLooking back at her youth between the ages of 18 sand 23, June says that she \"seemed to attract the opposite sex.\" \nJune, who turns 90 next month, also admitted she was quite into racy relations in her youth.

I only ever made love. It had to have something almost spiritual about it. \n\"Certainly between the ages of 18 and 23, when I married for the first time, I seemed to attract the opposite sex.\" \n\"Well, I hope you’ll forgive me if I confirm that yes, I was very beautiful,\" the absolute legend told the Daily Mail back in 2013. \"Certainly, between the ages of 18 and 23 when I married for the first time, I seemed to attract the opposite sex.\" Dot Cotton at work in the EastEnders launderette (Photo: BBC) Read More EastEnders bosses 'bid to stop spoilers leaking with changes to online cast lists' \n\"Don't get me wrong. I wasn't a nymphomaniac,\" she wrote in her 2013 autobiography Before The Year Dot. \"But I was sexually active although I kept quiet about it. You did back then. The war changed everything of course. \n\"I was 12 when it broke out. I joined the Wrens at 18 and that gave me a tremendous sense of liberation. As you couldn't be sure what tomorrow might bring, you felt like making the most of today. \n\"If I'd stayed at home I'd have married as a virgin.\" \nJune has sadly lived through her fair share of tragedy too. \nJune married actor John Garley, after meeting him at the Old Vic theatre in 1950. \nTragically, he committed suicide in 1957, after suffering from depression for many years. \nJune remarried again the next year, to Dixon of Dock Green actor Robert Arnold, and they had six children. He died in 2003 \nWhen she was just five, her younger brother John died of pneumonia aged just 15 days old. \nTwo years later, her older sister Marise died of an ear infection at the age of 8.
