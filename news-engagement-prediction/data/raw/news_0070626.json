Comment on This Story Staff Photographer SMU guard Jarrey Foster (10) and SMU guard Ben Emelogu II (21) fight for a loose ball against Tulane guard Melvin Frazier (35) during the second half of an NCAA basketball game at Moody Coliseum on Wednesday, Feb. 15, 2017, in Dallas. SMU won the game 80-75. (Smiley N. Pool/The Dallas Morning News) By Ben Baby , Staff Writer Contact Ben Baby on Twitter: @Ben_Baby \nGiven SMU's resiliency over the last few games, coach Tim Jankovich might run out of ways to praise his men's basketball team before it runs out of resolve. \nJankovich said the No. 17 Mustangs had the \"heart of lions\" following last weekend's 10-point road win against Houston. The win was another way for the Mustangs to display the mettle that's helped the leaders in the American Athletic Conference on their 10-game winning streak. SMU rallies again; 'team has hearts of lions,' Mustangs coach says after 10th straight win \nIn each of the last three games, SMU found itself trailing by a sizable margin before rallying to win. If the Mustangs need a fourth straight comeback win at UConn (14-13, 9-6 AAC) at 11 a.m. Saturday, Jankovich will be the last one to mind. \n\"It's not intramurals,\" Jankovich said. \"It's high-level college basketball. It's a 40-minute game. They all have a different personality. \n\"As long as we're figuring out how to get it done in the end, I'm good about it.\" \nBefore the last three games, SMU (24-4, 14-1) treated its opponents as if they were hapless fraternity squads. The Mustangs never trailed by more than five points in the seven games leading up to a showdown against Cincinnati on Feb. 12. \nAt home inside Moody Coliseum, SMU overcame a nine-point deficit to defeat the then-No. 11 Bearcats. A couple of days later, the Mustangs shook off a slow start and eliminated Tulane's 15-point lead en route to victory. \nThen last Saturday against Houston, SMU trailed by 13 points in the first half before it eventually pulled away from the Cougars in a 76-66 win. \nResiliency noted. \n\"They're ranked 19th, but they're probably better than that, which tells you how good we are, too,\" Houston coach Kelvin Sampson told reporters after the game. \"Let's not act like this wasn't a game that could have went either way for a long time.\" \nSMU's resolve has been on full display for the last two seasons and under two head coaches. \nIn 2015, the Larry Brown-led Mustangs went 25-5 despite knowing the NCAA tournament was out of the question because of a postseason ban. While the ban stemming from rules violations is gone, SMU still has to deal with scholarship limitations through the 2018-19 season. \nBut that hasn't stopped the Mustangs from winning 20 of their last 21 games. \n\"I think it speaks to what I've been saying all year,\" Jankovich said. \"This is a fighting group. This group doesn't go down easy.\" \nSMU is hoping to bounce back from probation as successfully as Saturday's opponent once did. UConn was given a one-year postseason ban in 2012-13 for poor grades. One year later under new coach Kevin Ollie, the Huskies won the national championship in Arlington as a No. 7 seed in the tournament. \nThanks to their current stretch of play, including the key victory over Cincinnati, the Mustangs are moving closer to securing a tournament bid and earning a favorable seed to make a long run in their first season under Jankovich. \nWith three games left until the AAC tournament in Hartford, Conn., Jankovich isn't worried about his team's recent need for dramatic wins. That might change if it the trend continues, he said. \nBut for now, the outcome is all that counts. \n\"I don't care how we get it done,\" Jankovich said. \"If we have to come back or hold on to a lead or hit a half-court shot, I don't care. This is winning time.\" This Topic is Missing Your Voice.
