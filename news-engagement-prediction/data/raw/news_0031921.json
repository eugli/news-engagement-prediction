Dunkin' Donuts just announced that their delicious iced coffee is going to be bottled and sold at the grocery store. \nFor a while now Starbucks has done this with their iced coffee and frapps, so it's exciting that DD is jumping on that bandwagon. \nThe ice coffee will be made with Dunkin's signature Arabica coffee blends, milk and real sugar. They will come in the following four flavors: Original Espresso French Vanilla \nThese are perfect when you are on the go and can't make it into an actual DD store!
