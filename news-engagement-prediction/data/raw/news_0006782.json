The only position he didn't play in Panama was catcher. He hit .171 and had a 2.25 earned run average in four one-inning pitching appearances. His fastball ranged from 93-97 mph. \nPirela is playing left field and hitting third and fifth in Zulia's batting order. \nPirela, 27, hit .345 with three homers and 12 RBIs during the Venezuelan playoffs.
