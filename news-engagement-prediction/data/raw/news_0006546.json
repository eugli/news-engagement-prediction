So it is now up to them if they find a case or not,\" he was quoted as saying. \nHe said the questions concerned the Kelantan Football Association (Kafa) spending, and did not rule out the possibility of being called for questioning again. \n\"I am ready any time, if they need to question me further,\" he said. \nWith regard to his position in Umno, Annuar said there was no rush to meet Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak over the matter. \n\"This has got nothing to do with the PM or the party. This is my case with the MACC, so let me manage this myself,\" he added. \nAnnuar also pointed out that the MACC investigation would not frustrate his bid to vie for the Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) presidency. \n\"There are several criteria that disqualify you from contesting the FAM presidency, including bankruptcy. Being investigated by MACC, however, is not one of them,\" he said. \nOn Jan 31, a Mara emergency board meeting decided to suspend Annuar, who was abroad on Mara matters at the time, with immediate effect as chairperson as well as head of Pelaburan Mara Bhd. \nThe suspension was to facilitate investigations into allegations that Mara Investment and Universiti Kuala Lumpur (UniKL) sponsored the Kelantan football team, which Annuar is linked to. \nOn Jan 12, Johor Crown Prince Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim accused Annuar of using his positions in Mara and UniKL to secure sponsorships for the Kelantan football team. \nTunku Ismail also revealed several documents detailing the said transactions and questioned if the sponsorship was the reason why UniKL was forced to reduce scholarships for its students by RM700 million last year. \nAnnuar, who is also former Kelantan Football Association (Kafa) president, denied the allegations. \nMeanwhile, MACC in a statement later, said Annuar accorded his full cooperation to the questioning session. \n\"He appeared voluntarily this morning and fully cooperated with the investigating team. \n\"So far, MACC has recorded statements from five individuals pertaining to the probe against Annuar.\" \nThe commission also urged all parties to not speculate regarding the case, to allow the probe to proceed smoothly. \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T13:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T10:26:56.805+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
