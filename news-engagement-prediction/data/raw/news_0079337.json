He said as far as he knows all the incidents have been verbal ones.\n\"The number in a month alarmed us,\" he said.\nWhile many of the incidents involve parents and referees, other times there were arguments between parents and coaches, among parents from opposing teams, or in one case parents on the same team.\nAbout 10 parents have been suspended this season for various reason and lengths of time, including for up to a year, said Doram.\n\"What we want people to do is just be conscious of their emotions,\" he said.\nParents need to know where to draw the line and be careful not to become \"verbally threatening,\" he said.\n\"We're going into a very emotional time now with city finals and provincials, and we just want people to act accordingly.\"\nMany referees are teenagers themselves, he said, with some as young as 13 years old.\nDoram said he has received emails from other sports organizations thanking Edmonton Hockey for sending the letter and drawing more attention to challenges they also face.\nSince 2011, Hockey Edmonton has required a parent or guardian of all new association members to take a one-hour online course called Respect in Sport, which is intended to encourage better behaviour among coaches and parents.\n\"It might not be a bad idea that there is a refresher course mandated after every so many years of being within the sport,\" Doram said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T22:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T03:19:00.897+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
