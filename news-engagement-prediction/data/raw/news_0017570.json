Her father worked the wharves and she met her late husband at the Bushell’s factory more than 60 years ago. \n“We used to scale them trams, we used to walk over the bridge go to the pool, keep sixpence for Luna Park,” she said. \nNeighbours fear the stressful move will take its toll on Flo. \n“It does lead to depression and to separation from everything that she’s known,” John McInerny from the Millers Point Resident Action Group said. \nSome 45 years ago Flo and her husband were key players in the fight to save The Rocks from demolition. Flo will no relocate to nearby Pyrmont.
