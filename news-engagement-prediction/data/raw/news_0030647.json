The Swiss government has given him the names of Swiss account holders. I want to ask Prime Minister Modi, why have you not revealed those names in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha? Why have you kept those thieves away from us?\" Gandhi said while addressing a rally in Uttar Pradesh's Sitapur. \nEarlier yesterday, Gandhi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav jointly announced the Samajwadi Party (SP)- Congress` Common Minimum Programme. \nThe programme, including ten points of commitment to the people of Uttar Pradesh, enlists the promises such as free smart phones to youth, employment to 20 lakh youth, loan waiver to farmers, reduction of power tariff, pension schemes for poor, better infrastructure, cycle to girls who will fall under merit list, 33 percent reservation to women in government jobs, free residence to Dalits and backward class poor.Uttarakhand goes to polls on February 15. \nFirst Published: Sunday, February 12, 2017 - 09:27 More from zeenews", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T07:09:49.772+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
