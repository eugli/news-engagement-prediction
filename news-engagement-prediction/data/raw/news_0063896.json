Chris Brown ’s neighbor, singer Kay Cola, claims the police were called several times and “didn’t do s - - t” about him beating up ex-girlfriend Karrueche Tran . “She left him! It wasn’t my place to speak on her issues, however now that she is speaking on it I can’t sit by and watch people say she’s lying . . . The police didn’t do s - - t they have been called out several times, do your research North Hollywood Police station. I spoke to her about it and I sent people upstairs and even went upstairs myself. I did what I could and that’s that,” she tweeted . Cola fired off a series of tweets after court documents revealed Brown allegedly threatened to shoot and kill Tran. A judge ordered Brown to stay away from Tran. “He said if no one else can have me that he’s gonna ‘take me out,’ ” Tran wrote. Cola said she couldn’t take Internet trolls calling Tran a liar. “Some of y’all make me sick to my stomach talking about. Karrecuhes [sic] lying. I’ve heard him beating her myself. I even called the police . . . I used to cry over that situation hearing her screaming at the top of her lungs,” she tweeted. “I never spoke up, cause I didn’t feel it was my place but hearing y’all say she’s lying I can’t just sit by and watch this . . . I even got into it with Chris because his loud ass used 2 wake up my daughter. He was rude as f - - k & I had known him since he was a kid,” she said. Brown’s attorney Mark Geragos and Tran’s rep did not comment.
