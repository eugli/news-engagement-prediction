Georgia has several players who'll get a shot to fill Maurice Smith's shoes but that's no easy task. Slot to Georgia Links \nThe official start date for Georgia’s spring camp hasn’t yet been released but three weeks into February we know that it’s less than a month away. \nWith that in mind, Dawgs247 is taking a look at a few of the Bulldogs most important and fierce competitions battles that will take place during those 15 practices. \nToday we take a look at the star/nickel position after the departure of Maurice Smith . (Photo: Tony Morano, 247Sports) \nReturning Starters/Contributors: Aaron Davis (Sr.), Dominick Sanders (Sr.), and Reggie Wilkerson (Sr.) \nNotes: None of these three players have much game experience at star but all three have worked here some. Davis and Wilkerson have primarily gotten looks at the “Money” position, which is the sixth defensive back in the dime package. Sanders played star some as a freshman but hasn’t returned to that position since. With Smith out of eligibility and Rico McGraw no longer with the team due to transfer, the Bulldogs will have to fill the role with someone who at least hasn’t played the position in a while. \nContenders: Deangelo Gibbs (Fr.), Richard LeCounte III (Fr.), and Tyrique McGhee (Soph.) \nNotes: If we’re placing bets here, the odds probably favor McGhee in the overall competition. He got a ton of reps at the star position a year ago despite not playing there during a game. Still, Gibbs and LeCounte have the necessary skills to be difference makers at the position. Gibbs has the size, build and coverage ability you want at the position but he’ll have to get up to speed quickly. The same could be said for LeCounte, who is a little smaller but more of a physical tackler. \nMcGhee, however, has already impressed the UGA staff with his toughness and willingness to strike. (Photo: Icon Sports Wire, Getty) \nGoing into spring: McGhee is the safest bet at this point. He was on the cusp of seeing the field a year ago and could roll right into that spot simply because of his willingness to be both a box player and cover, a trait necessary for that position. \nThose freshman can’t be ignored, though -- especially Gibbs. The skill set is strong there and he has the size coaches covet in that role these days. Expect those three and maybe a guy like Deandre Baker to get a look. \nPost-spring projection: McGhee’s toughness and experience will pay off here. While LeCounte and Gibbs have a world of ability, playing fast isn’t something that always happens right away. McGhee is going into year two of Mel Tucker’s scheme and that’s huge. CFB media reacts to NCAA's massive allegations against Ole Miss Start SlideShow \nThe possibility also exists that Gibbs or LeCounte make enough of an impression at safety that the staff could consider letting Davis slide down to play the position. Because of the mental and physical versatility needed to play the position, the fifth-year senior would be a bad choice there. LeCounte seems to be the more likely of the two freshmen to become that safety. But no matter how you slice it the competition will last into the season where a guy like Tray Bishop , at 6-foot-2, 190 pounds with sprinter’s speed, could also join the fray. There are a lot of talented options for the Bulldogs but it’s all pretty young.
