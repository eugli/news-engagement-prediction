New England Patriots beat the Atlanta Falcons, 34-28, in Super Bowl LI in Houston. USA TODAY Sports Tom Brady is the first quarterback to win five Super Bowl titles. (Photo: Kirby Lee, USA TODAY Sports) \nHOUSTON — Chalk up another measure of greatness for the dynasty. \nTom Brady and the New England Patriots won Super Bowl LI with a comeback for the ages, rallying from a 25-point deficit to raise the bar on legends, miracles and determined grit, too. \nPoor Atlanta. \nThe Patriots fell behind 28-3 in Super Bowl LI ... and still won. \nThis just doesn’t happen. Until now, no team had ever come back from more than 10 points down to win a Super Bowl. \nMORE FROM SUPER BOWL LI: \nThen again, no team has a trigger man quite like Brady, the first quarterback to win five Super Bowls, who settled down and found his groove when it mattered most. \nThe Super Bowl MVP passed for 466 yards, but he had plenty of help. \n\"We all brought each other back,\" he proclaimed after the 34-28 thriller that marked the first overtime game in Super Bowl history. \nNo argument here, TB12. While Brady found his aim in crunch time after a few glaring misses earlier in the game, the receivers who had muffed passes suddenly caught everything. \nThis included Julian Edelman, who had such a tough time going over the middle for much of the night, but made a magical catch for 23 yards on the game-tying drive late in the fourth quarter that you might not believe, even if you saw it in real time. \nI mean, Edelman was sandwiched by two defenders, absorbed a blow from a third defender and bobbled the ball as he fell, twisted, to the turf. He snagged the ball out of the air about two inches above turf. CLOSE x Share USA TODAY Sports' Lorenzo Reyes looks ahead to 2017 and what the New England Patriots must do in the offseason if they're going to have a chance for another Super Bowl title. USA TODAY Sports \nIt was kind of like two-for-one Super Bowls at NRG Stadium. \nThe young, fast and hungry Falcons won the opener, 28-3. \nYet in the final 25 minutes of game time — the nightcap, if you will — the Patriots outscored the Falcons 31-0. \nIn a Super Bowl. Go figure. \n\"Down 25 points, it’s hard to imagine us winning,\" Brady said. \nEvery great comeback, though, consists of multiple events that when strung together, tend to explain the bigger picture. The Patriots had to not only score touchdowns and keep the Falcons off the scoreboard, but they also needed to convert a pair of two-point conversions. \nAnd they got a bit of help from the Falcons. \nMORE FROM SUPER BOWL LI: Falcons know the truth: No way to get over Super Bowl LI collapse \nWhy in the world would a team set up for a deep pass on third-and-1, when leading by 16 points in the fourth quarter? Bad things tend to happen when flirting with such disaster, and they did. \nDont’a Hightower blitzed from the outside and crashed into Matt Ryan. Fumble. When Alan Branch recovered, the comeback was officially on. Five plays later, Brady hit Danny Amendola for the 6-yard touchdown that was followed by James White’s two-point conversion on a direct snap. \nWhite, the shifty running back, was the undeniable X-factor. He caught 14 passes for 110 yards and scored three touchdowns. On the game-winning, 2-yard TD run, 3:58 into overtime, he took a toss play outside to the corner and was nearly stopped short of the goal line. \nBut he kept pushing, plowing across the plane of the goal line. \nThat play pretty much summed up the Patriots’ effort overall. They kept plugging away. \nIt’s the mark of true champions, which the Patriots have again demonstrated that they indeed are. \nFollow columnist Jarrett Bell on Twitter @JarrettBell . Facebook Posted!
