Ever since Kylie Jenner trademarked the name \" Kylighter \" last summer, we had a feeling that highlighters would be inevitable. And, after months of semi-patient waiting, it's finally happened: Jenner just revealed her upcoming highlighter collection on her Snapchat. \nThe collection includes six colors: a rose-gold that's more rose than gold (\"Strawberry Shortcake\"), warm beige (\"Salted Caramel\"), icy gold (\"French Vanilla\"), rich brown (\"Chocolate Cherry\"), true gold (\"Banana Split\"), and, Kylie's favorite, a pale beige tone called Cotton Candy Cream. (Are you hungry yet?) Really, though, we give her credit for being able to choose a favorite, because they're all pretty. \nFair warning for the faint of heart or anyone who appreciates a subtle look, because these powders are packed with shimmer and pigment. We can't say for sure, but their sparkle would probably be visible in a blackout.
