In EU, Origen sit at the bottom of Group B, without a win to their name. However Erik 'Tabzz' van Helvert , the ADC for Origen, isn’t quite as unhappy with the new ADC style as some. When asked if he thought ADC had got harder this season with all the changes he was more sanguine. \n\"No, I think the recent lethality buff in 7.2 has made ADC stronger,\" he explained. \"The lethality buff increased Jhin's power, while opening up options like ArPen Varus and Miss Fortune. These build paths have more impact in the midgame than crit focused builds.\" © LoL Esports \nJhin has certainly been a hot topic so far this season. While Tabzz seems to think that his power is quite high, he's only played the champion once this split in competitive games, instead playing a lot of Varus, who's also been a top pick for many. Kobbe on the other hand has brought Jhin onto the Rift in six of his 11 games so far, with a 50 percent win rate. \n\"Right now the meta for ADC's are more utility based ADs and not hypercarries,\" says Kobbe. \"Bot lane is all about level six at the moment, so champions like Ashe, Jhin and Varus are some of the best picks. In general you just try to farm to get your item power spike, before that you can't do so much.\" Splyce’s Kobbe at Worlds last year © Lolesports / Flickr \nWith patch 7.3 making some changes to the ADC role and the upcoming 7.4 update supposedly bringing even more, the ADC meta is always changing. For some the current situation is a good thing, whereas other must try and find a way to play around it. \n\"The role of ADC has changed from a tank-killer slash engage tool into a more generic damage dealer and poke role,\" says Tabzz. \"I like it when the ADC role is somewhat caster-focused: Corki, Kog'maw and Lucian are some of my favourite champions, but I think the current meta is fine.\" \nHowever Kobbe has a different view, saying that Riot made more than a few mistakes with the big pre-season patch and is yet to fix them. Some of his issues have been addressed in the 7.3 patch, but a lot of his complaints lie in the core gameplay and are not something a change or two to a specific champion can really fix. \n\"I think Riot messed up a lot of their reworks on champions for this season,\" explains Kobbe. \"The impact it has for ADCs is that you can't really outplay people any more when there are champions like Rengar, Camille, Leblanc and Katarina or the usual super tanks you need three or four items to kill. Riot aware of this, since almost every pro player has been talking about it. Of course I hope they will make some changes as fast as possible. I'm not even sure how they didn't make these changes already, but I guess they'll come soon.\" Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:49:39.645+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
