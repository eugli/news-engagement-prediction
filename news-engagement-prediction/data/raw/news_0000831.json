Milly Smith, a 23-year-old nursing student from the UK, is using her platform of over 56K Instagram followers to confront all the body transformation photos we see on our feeds, and in doing so, she's proving a very important point about self-love. \nMilly recently took to Instagram to share two photos of herself . In the photo on the left, she's wearing control-top tights, giving the appearance of a thigh gap and a flat stomach, and on the right, she's pulled the tights down over her stomach and hips. \n\"Same girl, same day, same time,\" she captioned the photo. \"Not a before and after. Not a weight loss transformation. Not a diet company promotion. I am comfortable with my body in both. Neither is more or less worthy. Neither makes me more or less of a human being. Neither invites degrading comments and neither invites sleezy words.\" ADVERTISEMENT \nIn her insanely empowering caption, Milly explains how concerning it is that people could see one photo to be more attractive than the other when they were only taken seconds apart, and that this shows a major problem with society's perception of beauty. But for Milly, taking these raw photos has been cathartic, and that's what matters. \n\"We are so blinded to what a real unposed body looks like and blinded to what beauty is that people would find me less attractive within a 5 second pose switch! How insanely ridiculous is that!?\" she wrote. \"I love taking these, it helps my mind so much with body dysmorphia and helps me rationalize my negative thoughts.\" \nMilly is one of the many body-positive advocates who've shared side-by-side photos to show how deceiving social media can be. She's urging her followers to stop comparing themselves to edited images they see on the internet and to just strive to be the best version of themselves. \n\"Don't compare, just live for you,\" she wrote. \"There is no one on this planet who's like you and that's pretty damn amazing don't ya think. The world doesn't need another copy, it needs you. We are worthy, valid and powerful beyond measure. (If you don't pull your tights up as high as possible are you really human?)\" \nWe're so thankful for people like Milly who are diffusing our flawless feeds and keeping it so real in their photos.
