As the vehicle ground to a halt on the verge, fans were wondering what the consequences might be for Dot. \nThe pensioner, who has been struggling with her eyesight recently, took Matthew for a trip to the garden centre but the day took an unpleasant turn when, distracted by a sat-nav, Dot lost control of the car. (Picture: BBC) \nThankfully, she didn’t crash into any other vehicles on the road but the incident is likely to have been terrifying for Dot and Matthew – and Jack Branning is bound to be upset with her for putting his son at risk. (Picture: BBC) \nWill the accident lead to Dot losing her driving license – and might it also prompt her to take her ailing sight more seriously moving forward? (Picture: BBC) \nOr might the guilt and the fear of what has happened lead to Dot going back into her shell? \n— BBC EastEnders (@bbceastenders) February 23, 2017 \nEastEnders continues on Friday 24th February at 8pm on BBC One.
