That’s when Republicans, powered by Tea Party protests — in part over the Affordable Care Act that Pelosi shepherded through the House — retook the House.\nRelated Stories Dianne Feinstein Tweet Supreme court Trump picks appeals court Judge Neil Gorsuch for Supreme Court Parents, educators protest secretary of education nominee in Oakland On Tuesday, she attacked the 12-day-old administration as “incompetent” and said that while she hoped to work with it on some issues, like a jobs-producing infrastructure plan, Democrats were prepared to “resist” — especially when Republicans try to dismantle the Affordable Care Act.\nShe blasted the ban on travel from seven majority Muslim nations that Trump issued Friday through an executive order.\n“Our president is reckless — reckless — and his administration is incompetent,” she said. “How and why they did this is because they are grand illusionists. Anytime they have a problem with something, they create another problem.”\nOther highlights of the town hall:\nOn immigration: A veterinarian who lives on a large ranch four miles from the U.S.-Mexico border told in chilling detail how he came one night to see what he thought was his dogs playing with a ball — instead it was the head of a woman who had illegally crossed the border. Pelosi winced, before he asked her if she supported Trump’s plan to build a southern border wall.\n“You know and I know that the Mexican government is not going to pay for it,” Pelosi said, pointing out that neither House Republicans nor Trump has definitively explained how to fund a wall that could cost upward of $14 billion.\nOn sanctuary cities: A woman who tearfully described how her child was tortured and killed by an undocumented immigrant asked Pelosi how she could continue to support sanctuary cities.\n“I can’t even imagine the pain. I pray for you,” Pelosi said. A couple of times during the program she proudly referred to San Francisco as a sanctuary city and said the point is to give immigrants a way to come forward to report crimes without fear of being deported — not to protect criminals.\n“We see it as a place where it makes us safer,” she said. “You do not turn law enforcement officers into immigration officials.”\nOn Trump’s false claims of voter fraud: Pelosi confirmed reports that when she and other Congressional leaders met with Trump he bragged that he would have won the popular vote if 3 million to 5 million people had not voted illegally.\n“When I said, ‘that’s not true, there’s no evidence to support that,’” Pelosi said, “he said, ‘and I’m not even counting California.’”\nThe danger in that false assertion, Pelosi said, is that “it’s a predicate for the president to go out and say, there’s voter fraud rampant around the country,” she said. “And it’s not true.”\nJoe Garofoli is The San Francisco Chronicle’s senior political writer.
