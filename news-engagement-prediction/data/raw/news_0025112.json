(AFP) \nIndia has issued a demarche to China, protesting its stand to block a UN ban on Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar. \nThe MEA said on Thursday demarches had been given to the Chinese embassy in New Delhi and in the foreign office in Beijing by the Indian embassy. External affairs ministry spokesperson Vikas Swarup also said the matter has been taken up with the Chinese ambassador here and a similar demarche is being made in Beijing. \nHe said the proposal was not moved by India but by three permanent members of the UN Security Council – the US, the UK and France, adding it was “a classic counter-terrorism proposal” and hoped that China will also come around to accept this view.

We hope relevant parties have enough time to consult with each other to make sure that the decision made by the Committee will be based on consensus representing the broad international community,” Kang said.
