Photograph: Americasroof View more sharing options Olivia Laing Thursday 23 February 2017 07.30 GMT \nThe Christodora skews the skyline of the East Village, hulking over a once-bohemian neighbourhood of New York City. Built in the 1920s as a settlement house for low-income immigrants, it fell into dereliction in the 1960s, the ruined apartments colonised by heroin addicts, before being reborn in the 1980s as luxury condominiums. A controversial symbol of the neighbourhood’s increasing gentrification, it’s an ideal setting for this sprawling, seething, sumptuous tale of the city’s haves and have-nots under the long shadow of Aids . \nCities isolate, but they also connect, sweeping strangers into temporary, precarious intimacies and dependencies. The urban novel has always been fascinated with mapping these invisible ties, tracing encounter and fallout with all the assiduity of an epidemic model. Infectious diseases likewise, of course, carry out a work of revelation, making legible hidden chains of connection: one-night stands, shared needles, instances of momentary recklessness or long-concealed desire. A plague reveals links even as it rubs them out; a plague novel can trace the fallout over decades. \nJared arrives at the Christodora first, in 1981: a privileged young artist cheerfully co-opting his father’s new office as a studio for his sub- Richard Serra industrial sculpture. Outside, Tompkins Square Park is a tent city, an encampment of the homeless; up here, it’s possible to focus on more rarefied concerns, such as art and love. \nHe is smitten by a fellow student, the self-contained Millie, whose manic-depressive mother, Ava, works as a public health official before establishing a care home for women with Aids. It’s there that Ava gets to know a Latina woman, Issy Mendes; in “a series of extremely random events that somehow all tied together”, Jared and Millie adopt Issy’s small son, Mateo, after her death. Among their neighbours at the Christodora is Hector Villanueva, a once-celebrated Aids activist who has stumbled into the toxic embrace of crystal meth. \nTim Murphy eschews chronology, following the intersecting fortunes of these six people over the next four decades by way of kaleidoscopic scenes. The result is disorienting, jagged; appropriate in a novel so concerned with trauma and its aftereffects, with drugs and their sometimes virtuous, sometimes malign reshapings of reality. Ava’s medication keeps her sane, but it also imprisons her: “the exhausting, rotating mix of pills and their weird, sweaty, enervating, weight-gaining, narcolepsy-inducing, strange-tics-and-sparks-in-the-brain-provoking side effects”. \nAs an activist in the Aids Coalition to Unleash Power, or Act Up, and later an adviser to the Clinton administration, Hector battles for a viable treatment. The invention of combination therapy in 1995 puts an end to this work; shipwrecked by grief and exhaustion, he finds the “I-need-nothing-else-ever perfection” of crystal meth an irresistible solace. And Mateo too, struggling to navigate the many dangerous gulfs between his adoptive parents and himself, falls for heroin. Inevitably, he finds his way to Hector, nodding ecstatically in the foetal funk of his basement room. \nMurphy is exceptionally skilled at writing about addiction, the intertwining of bliss and abjection. Mateo and Hector’s horrifying nadir takes place in LA: a naked girl splayed on a rug, the TV screen “exploding with the orange-tan flesh and pounding techno music of gay porn”. A former user himself, who has written movingly about his struggle with methamphetamine, Murphy grasps the way that drugs can be used both to banish and to summon lost scenes from the past, sympathising without glossing over the disastrous suite of consequences that arise from getting high. \nWhat makes this novel remarkable, though, is the way it captures the full arc of Aids in New York, a subject Murphy has long covered as a reporter. The past few years have seen a spate of films – The Normal Heart , How to Survive a Plague and United in Anger among them – that reckon with the crisis, detailing in particular the crucial role that direct action played in securing a treatment. Murphy brings to life the demos and die-ins, the people who turned themselves into world-class researchers by sheer force of will, the packed meetings “that were like a gay disco but with slogan T-shirts and sign-up boards”. But he is also attentive to the long-term consequences of those years of battle: the post-traumatic stress disorder and survivors’ guilt, the attritions of mourning so many thousands of dead. \nUnusually, he chooses to turn the spotlight on Act Up’s heroines, too: the predominantly working class Latina women and sex workers who fought to make the federal definition of Aids encompass symptoms that only affected women, so that they could gain access to disability benefits, research and drug trials. “She blossomed,” a friend says of Issy. “That was the thing about the movement, wasn’t it? People came thinking they were dying but they ended up finding out how powerful they really were.” \nThat is not a bad lesson for the present moment, and nor is the warmth with which Murphy writes. There have been several whopping New York novels in the last couple of years, but none of them possesses Christodora ’s generosity, its weathered and unflinching faith in what people can achieve – when, that is, they’re forced by circumstance to work together. \n• Olivia Laing’s latest book is The Lonely City (Canongate).
