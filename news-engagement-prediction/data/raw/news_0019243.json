The decision to dissolve the board was resisted by the City Manager who is now under pressure from the Donald Trump-like totalitarian tendencies of Mashaba‚” the ANC asserted. \nIt added that the power utility’s board was now in an “unenviable position” to either comply with Mashaba's instruction and suspend Xulu‚ or risk being dissolved for refusing to suspend Xulu. \n“The ANC believes that Lukhwareni will not be able to resist Mashaba's thirst to remove boards of City entities for too long‚ especially at City Power‚” the ANC stated. “Mashaba has pretended to be on a corruption-busting mission‚ but his extraordinary interest in City Power tenders reveals his true interests. \nIf not for him‚ at least for the hawks within the DA who know his vulnerability because of his lack of support in the party structures. Rumours that Mashaba is in debt also fueled suspicions about his ruthless pursuit for Xulu‚ disregarding the need for due process and respect for the country's laws‚” the ANC added. \nMashaba said he found it staggering that the ANC would take interest in investigations into City Power tenders authorised during their term in office. \n“I regard it as an indication that we are looking into the right tenders‚” he said. \n“This interest and opposition to our fight against corruption in the City of Joburg gives credence to the idea that where there is smoke there is fire. The statement of the ANC begs the question‚ ‘If there is nothing to hide in this tender‚ why the level of interest?’. \n“When I entered office I declared corruption public enemy number one and I am committed to rooting it out of every corner of our City. The days of politicians and officials shamelessly looting public money are over. \n“I condemn the ANC’s distasteful and shameless attack on City Manager‚ Dr Ndivho Lukhwareni‚ someone with such a distinguished career. This career includes serving as the Deputy City Manager under an ANC administration in Tshwane‚” Mashaba said. \nHe said he had a direct message for the ANC: “If you have any discomfort in the focus of our investigations‚ all I can say is please get used to it. I can offer you no comfort‚ only the assurance those found guilty of corruption are behind bars and stolen money is recovered.” Share Tweet SHARE YOUR OPINION If you have an opinion you would like to share on this article, please to the Times LIVE iLIVE team.
