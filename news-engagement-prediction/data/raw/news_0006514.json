She is the daughter of Krishnakumar of Sankaramangalam House, at Chingoli, near Haripad in Alappuzha. \nAccording to Regi Ram, director in charge of the Gandhinagar campus of SME, the events that led to the tragic incident began when Adarsh, who had to appear for a supplementary examination on Wednesday, came into the girl’s classroom during the mid day break and wanted her to have a private talk. But the girl refused. \nAccording to SME sources, both were seeing each other for some time, but the girl had backed out some time ago. The boy was, however, persistent with his overtures. \nAfter the girl’s refusal, he went out and returned with a can of petrol which he poured over himself. A bewildered girl then ran out of the room trying to seek refuge in the library nearby. But the boy, in a frenzy, chased her, came into the library, poured the rest of the petrol on her and hugged her. \nStudents threatened \nHe threatened the other students who tried to rescue them with pouring petrol on them. When they stood back, he set both of them ablaze with the lighter he had kept with him, students said. \nBoth were immediately rushed to the Kottayam Government Medical College Hospital. Their depositions were made under magisterial presence. According to R.P. Renjin, resident medical officer (RMO) at the hospital, the boy had suffered 80% burns and the girl 65%. “They both had suffered deep burns,” Dr. Renjin said. \nAdarsh succumbed to burns by 7 p.m. and the girl after half-an-hour. \nTwo students who tried to help the girl also suffered burns.
