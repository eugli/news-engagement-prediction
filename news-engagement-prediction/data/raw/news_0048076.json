The show, which will launch Feb. 28, will run from noon to 3 p.m. weekdays. It replaces a talk show that had been hosted by Jeff Wagner , who moved to mid-mornings Jan. 3 after the December departure of conservative host Charlie Sykes . Steve Scaffidi resigned as Oak Creek's mayor and joined WTMJ radio as an afternoon show… more Scott Paulus Scaffidi has been a guest co-host on the afternoon show in recent weeks, at times teaming with Bilstad. The new show will be called “Scaffidi & Bilstad” and will focus on the biggest stories of the day with Scaffidi’s perspective. Aside from his mayoral duties, Scaffidi has been an account executive at Green Bay-based Leonard & Finco Public Relations . He also resigned that position to join WTMJ radio. Scaffidi had one year remaining as Oak Creek mayor, a position he held since April 2012. Before that he served as an Oak Creek alderman and Common Council president. Scaffidi worked in media research for the Nielsen Company for 28 years until his election as Oak Creek mayor. “I’m looking forward to joining WTMJ to inform and entertain the listeners with honest conversation as a conservative,” Scaffidi said in a press release. “Now more than ever we need quality news, information and perspective on-air.” Tom Langmyer , vice president and general manager of WTMJ and WKTI-FM (94.5), has moderated the political perspective of WTMJ radio talk shows from conservative to less-doctrinaire views the past couple years, including dropping syndicated conservative talk shows that aired late nights and weekends. Although Wagner is conservative, he frequently discusses topics that aren’t specifically political. “(Scaffidi) brings a great depth of knowledge and local connection, to add to his take on the news of the day,” Langmyer said in the press release. “Steve is a Wisconsin native, has a deep background and much life experience, beyond broadcasting.” WTMJ radio is owned by the E.W. Scripps Company (NYSE: SSP), Cincinnati. The station is a business news partner of the Milwaukee Business Journal. Senior Reporter Rich Kirchen covers health care, sports business, politics and media/advertising for the Milwaukee Business Journal.
