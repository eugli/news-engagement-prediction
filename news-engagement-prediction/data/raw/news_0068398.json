Wanderers humbled by Urawa 1:58 \n“This incident involved key leaders of the RBB who have shown no remorse for their actions of bringing our Club and the game of football into disrepute and have continued to flaunt their disdain for the Club and our diverse and inclusive membership family further on social media. “As a Club we have had enough and have put the entire group on notice. While the vast majority of the RBB are exceptional in their support and actions for this Club we must remove all those who see themselves as bigger than the Club they support.” \nMore to come ... \nPODCAST: Adam Peacock, Simon Hill and Daniel Garb tackle all the big issues in the game - starting with matters on and off the field from the Sydney Derby.
