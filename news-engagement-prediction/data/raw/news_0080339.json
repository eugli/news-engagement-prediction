Lily replied: ‘You are a d**k. And it was. I was there, you weren’t.’ \nA further user wrote: ‘maybe if you didn’t pump your body full of drugs you wouldn’t have miscarried’. Lily left her Twitter account in the wake of hurtful comments about her stillborn son (Picture: Neil H Kitson/WireImage) \nShe also posted a since-deleted Twitter poll asking: ’15-35 year olds who do you feel more marginalised by?’ \nLily later tweeted: ‘My timeline is full of the most disgusting, sexist, misogynistic, racist s**t. Really, new levels. I’m no masochist so I’ll be back.’ My timeline is full of the most disgusting, sexist, misogynistic, racist shit. Really, new levels.
