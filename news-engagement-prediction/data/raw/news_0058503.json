Now, a company called ColorWare is going down the same retro route, this time with the even newer PlayStation 4 Pro. \nLike Sony’s retro PS4, ColorWare is only producing a limited number of these custom PS4 Pros. However, we imagine ColorWare will produce significantly less than the 12,000-odd that Sony did. \nThe hefty $899 (around £720/ AU$ 1170) might slow down sales slightly given that it’s more than double the price of a standard PS4 Pro, but we’re still willing to bet they’ll sell out pretty quickly. Retro gaming \nThe console is a North American model and will come with a 1TB hard drive, a matching dual-shock controller, all its original boxing, and a ColorWare Warranty of 12 months. \nIf you missed out on Sony’s original 20th Anniversary console you can still pick them up on eBay, though you’d better be prepared to pay in the region of thousands rather than hundreds. \nIf you’re that desperate for the retro color scheme it might actually be more financially sensible to opt for ColorWare’s unofficial paint job. They may be selling the North American model of the console but they ship all over the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:40:35.988+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
