Castillo then applied MOP C-System Curl Defying Cream on the midshafts to the ends to bring out Berry's natural texture. The key to making the look red-carpet appropriate, says Castillo, is to use a curling iron (in this case, a T3) to detail the look and create an asymmetrical shape. \nWas he worried about the threat of rain? \"Absolutely,\" says Castillo, who sealed the look with MOP C-System Firm Hair Spray, \"and then prayed to the hair gods that the rain wasn't going to mess it up.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T01:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T05:30:33.108+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
