(Photo: family photo)\nJust in time for statehood day or Valentine’s Day – or heck, any other day, this being Arizona – the Legislature is going to bat for your neighbors who shoot off their guns inside city limits.\nSpecifically, our leaders want to give them a large-caliber loophole that would shield them from prosecution.\nAll they’d have to do is say it was an accident.\n“Accidents are an unfortunate fact of life,\" the bill’s sponsor, Rep. Tony Rivero, R-Peoria, recently told the House Judiciary and Public Safety Committee.\nTell it to Shannon Smith. Or rather, to her family.\nWon't it always be an 'accident?' Phoenix police officers go door to door passing out \"Shannon’s Law\" fliers Dec. 30, 2015, at a Phoenix condo complex. Police are doing the same thing this year to raise awareness about the dangers of random gunfire. (Photo: Mark Henle/The Republic)\nShannon was 14 in the summer of 1999 when she was shot in the head while in the back yard of her central Phoenix home, killed by a stray bullet that police believe was fired into the air from as far as half a mile away. No one was ever arrested.\nThanks to the work of Shannon’s parents, it is now a felony to negligently fire a weapon inside city limits. There are exceptions: if you’re on a supervised shooting range or firing in self-defense or more than a mile away from an occupied structure.\nHouse Bill 2287 would bar prosecutors from bringing charges as long as the gun owner can claim it was accident. (Read: any time he or she is caught.) And even then, they could be only hit with a class six felony if the gun was fired within a quarter-mile of an occupied structure, as opposed to the current mile-wide no-shoot zone.\nRELATED: Out of tragedy, father led crusade for 'Shannon's Law'\nPolice and prosecutors oppose the bill on safety grounds.\nSadly, Shannon’s parents are gone now, no longer able to tell our leaders the other side of the story. About what it’s like to lose your daughter because she stepped into the yard to take a phone call, just weeks before she was to enter Xavier College Preparatory. About what it was like to find her there, lying face up in the grass.\nLory Smith died in 2008. Otis Smith died in 2015.\n“The loss of a child is a terrible tragedy,” Otis would say in 2009, a decade after his daughter’s death. “But it is my hope that Shannon didn't die in vain.”\nOne lawmaker asked the right questions Last week, Republicans on the panel voted to support the gutting of Shannon’s Law -- all except for Rep. Maria Syms, R-Paradise Valley, who asked a couple of logical questions.\nThings like: how many people have been prosecuted for accidentally discharging a firearm inside city limits? (Neither Rivero nor the lobbyist for the Arizona Citizens Defense League could point to a single case.)\nMORE: Arizona still on a quest to end celebratory gunfire\nThings like: How can someone be prosecuted for the inadvertent discharge of a gun when the current standard for prosecution requires criminal negligence “of such nature and degree that the failure to perceive it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the situation?”\n“I would be very surprised to find anyone being prosecuted for accidentally shooting a gun,\" Syms said.\nI wonder if the first-termer was surprised that her logical questions mattered not a whit to her Republican colleagues, who didn’t need to debate it and asked no questions about it. The bill passed 6-5 , with Syms joining Democrats to oppose it. Next up: a vote by the full House.\nI expect it’ll pass.\n2 (bad) reasons to water down the law As Rivero says, \"The vast majority of firearm discharges result in no injuries and very minimal property damage. How many miscarriages of justice are acceptable?\"\nNever mind that he couldn’t name even one. And for good reason, as it turns out.\n“If it is an accidental discharge, we would not prosecute,” Maricopa County Attorney’s Office spokeswoman Amanda Jacinto told me.\nSo the purpose of watering down the law to reflect what already is reality?\nI can think of only two reasons:\nNo. 1. To protect gun who owners who really do know what they’re doing when they fire their weapons, whether or not they understand the concept of gravity.\nOr No. 2. To shamelessly play to the gun lobby and to heck with the memory of a young girl whose parents are no longer around to fight for protecting people like her.\nHey, our leaders are always in re-election mode and 2018 is just around the corner.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/azcentral/uscp-web-static-2238.0/images/social-icons/oval-1-facebook@2x.png", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/azcentral/uscp-web-static-2238.0/images/social-icons/oval-1-copy-3-email@2x.png", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/01/30/Phoenix/Phoenix/636214014439500849-Shannon-Smith.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/azcentral/uscp-web-static-2238.0/images/social-icons/oval-1-facebook@3x.png", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/azcentral/uscp-web-static-2238.0/images/social-icons/oval-1-copy-twitter.png", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/azcentral/uscp-web-static-2238.0/images/social-icons/oval-1-copy-twitter@2x.png", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/azcentral/uscp-web-static-2238.0/images/social-icons/comments-copy.png", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/azcentral/uscp-web-static-2238.0/images/social-icons/comments-copy@2x.png", "https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/GetDocumentPdf/445898", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//azc.cc/2jPWk5b&text=Roberts%3A%20Arizona%20legislators%20out%20to%20gut%20gun%20law%20&via=azcentral", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/azcentral/uscp-web-static-2238.0/images/social-icons/comments-copy@3x.png", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/azcentral/uscp-web-static-2238.0/images/social-icons/oval-1-copy-3-email.png", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/azcentral/uscp-web-static-2238.0/images/social-icons/oval-1-copy-3-email@3x.png", "https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/68810", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a6a6316778357e29a48633b7c9b980c441aa17a6/c=0-19-400-245&r=x329&c=580x326/local/-/media/2016/12/29/Phoenix/Phoenix/636186286796389517-shannonslaw.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/azcentral/uscp-web-static-2238.0/images/social-icons/oval-1-facebook.png", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/336d1cb20b230d67d05098ad31354076e1267b2d/c=0-163-267-314&r=x329&c=580x326/local/-/media/2017/01/30/Phoenix/Phoenix/636214014439500849-Shannon-Smith.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2016/12/29/Phoenix/Phoenix/636186286796389517-shannonslaw.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/azcentral/uscp-web-static-2238.0/images/social-icons/oval-1-copy-twitter@3x.png"], "published": "2017-01-31T21:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:19:31.663+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
