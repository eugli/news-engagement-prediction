We have to stick to the stringent criteria and the criteria for handling a firearm in the UK is still the toughest in the world.”\nThe questionnaire, circulated over three weeks last month and answered by a third of the 31,000 Met officers, found that 43.6% wanted more firearms personnel.\nA total of 26% thought officers should be routinely armed, compared with the 20% who said so in an England and Wales-wide survey last year; 12% said they never want to carry a firearm on duty under any circumstances.\nAfter Islamic State terrorists killed 130 people in gun and bomb attacks in Paris in November 2015 , Met firearms officers were upped from 2,200 to 2,800. MI5’s terror threat level has rested on “severe”, the fourth most serious of five levels, since August 2014.\nMarsh, a former Tottenham police constable of 22 years, also wants extra investment in stun guns, and added: “If you look at the last two to three years, the number of assaults on police are going up unrecognisably.\n“The average constable doesn’t hold the same authority. When I was a child, you didn’t dare blink at a police officer.”\nPolice who Tasered race adviser were 'doing what public expect of them' Read more \nMarsh said deaths linked to Taser usage was always a concern. The devices have been related to at least 10 deaths in England and Wales over the past decade, but he said “those are always linked to health”.\nDalian Atkinson, 48, a former Aston Villa footballer who suffered illness affecting his kidneys and blood pressure, died last August after being shot three times with a Taser .\nHuman rights groups have criticised the use of Tasers , and Liberty called an incident, in which a Bristol police officer was filmed Tasering a race relations adviser , as “deeply disturbing”.\nDiane Abbott , shadow home secretary, has frequently spoken of the “cautious” approach police should take to using stun guns, and last week criticised the use of the mesh fabric “spit hoods”, which can be cloaked over a suspect’s head.\nA spokesman for the Met refused to say whether any decision was being made to increase Taser and firearm capacity.\nCommander Matt Twist, in charge of armed policing, said the force was “rightly proud” of being a “predominately unarmed police service”.\n“Every single officer who carries a Taser is fully and professionally trained to do so. This will be kept under constant review and if the risks our officers face can be mitigated by more officers carrying Taser, then of course that will be considered.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:26:21.864+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
