It becomes just part of what you do,\" Chase told CTV News Thursday, recalling the incident.\n\"I did what I could do, and I don't take a lot of credit for it. Anybody could have done what I did.\"\nHe stopped bystanders from performing CPR, saying that pumping Draganâ€™s heart would only make things worse. Instead, Chase helped him breathe, and used a towel from a nearby coffee shop to stop the flow of blood.\nWhen paramedics arrived, he briefed them on Dragan's condition so they could continue the life-saving efforts he'd started.\n\"I didn't think he would survive because he was bleeding out, he was pale,\" Chase said.\nBut Dragan did survive, largely due to the efforts of the doctor who happened to be in the right place at the right time.\nMore than two years after the incident, Chase received the Vancouver Police Department's highest award for civilian bravery, the Award of Merit.\n\"Much like police officers, doctors are never really off duty,\" the police board said in a statement announcing this year's award winners .\n\"At any point, in any place, they can be called upon to save a life.\"\nAfter shooting Dragan, Battersby headed along the seawall to Science World, where there was a gun battle with police that ended with him being shot multiple times by responding officers.\nThe gunman pleaded guilty in the fall of 2016, and was sentenced to 18 years in prison in October .\nWith a report from CTV Vancouver's St. John Alexander \nRelated Stories Yaletown shooter sentenced to 18 years in prison 2 locations, 3 victims: Timeline of daytime Vancouver shooting Gerald Battersby pleads guilty for 2014 Yaletown shooting rampage Photos Dr. Cliff Chase poses with his award from the Vancouver Police Department on Thursday, Feb. 9, 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T04:44:09.725+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
