Churkin was often at odds with the United States, the United Kingdom and France. China would often take its cue from how Russia would vote. For a decade, it was Churkin who raised his arm to veto numerous resolutions ranging from the Syrian crisis to the Malaysia Airlines crash over eastern Ukraine . He stood firm in supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime against Western attacks. And he cited US policy in Libya as a symbol of failure by Western countries who favored regime change. Nikki Haley, US ambassador to the United Nations, called Churkin \"a gracious colleague.\" \"We did not always see things the same way, but he unquestionably advocated his country's positions with great skill,\" she said in a statement. Susan Rice, a former US envoy to the United Nations, said Churkin was \"a formidable adversary, but always a friend.\" Vitaly was a formidable adversary, but always a friend.
