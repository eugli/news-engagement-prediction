He made 26 of 39 shots, scored 20 points in the fourth quarter and became the first player since Kobe Bryant in 2011 to win MVP honors on his home floor. \n“It was amazing,” Davis said. “That’s what I wanted to do ... get the MVP for this crowd, for this city. This one definitely means a lot to me.” NBA (@NBA) AD caps off his record setting night with the #NBAAllStar Play of the Night powered by @JBLaudio ! pic.twitter.com/jLFvgIlV8K February 20, 2017 \nDavis was the star of stars in a game where the teams combined for more points than in any other All-Star contest. It came on a night when Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant provided a glimpse of the past, Giannis Antetokounmpo had more dunks — 12 — than his name has consonants and LeBron James became the first player to eclipse 300 points in an All-Star career.

Not this time. It was Davis hoisting the trophy, thanks to his West team-mates deferring to their host time and again. “It shows our guys recognize what the weekend is about,” West coach Steve Kerr said \nDurant had a triple-double with 21 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists. Stephen Curry added 21 points for the West — where a subplot emerged as DeMarcus Cousins played only two minutes, prompting some speculation that a trade sending him out of Sacramento might be looming. But Kerr said Cousins wanted only a brief appearance because of injury, and that Kawhi Leonard asked for the second half off as well. \nAntetokounmpo had 30 points for the East. James scored 23 — including a three-pointer from the midcourt logo — while his Cleveland team-mate Kyrie Irving added 22 points and 14 assists. \n“There were a few too many transition baskets allowed,” East coach Brad Stevens deadpanned. “But I think that was strictly coaching.” NBA (@NBA) February 20, 2017 \nDavis became the story that overshadowed The Story coming into this game, that being the Durant-Westbrook whatever. If any animus remains between Durant and Westbrook, it was hidden. They passed each other the ball in the pregame layup line, and not long after Westbrook checked into the game the former Oklahoma City team-mates provided one of the game’s top highlights — a give-and-go, capped by Durant lobbing the ball to set Westbrook up for a dunk.

Players jumped and threw hands skyward, Curry tossing a cupful of ice water onto a smiling Durant amid it all. \n“It was a nice give-and-go, man,” Westbrook said. Added Durant: “It was a great basketball play. He was open so I threw him the lob. He can jump really high so yeah, good play.” \nKerr said that set the West up for the rest of the night. “I guess that’s kind of the beauty of the game,” Kerr said. “You just let the game break the ice, and that play, I thought, broke the ice.” \nWestbrook scored 12 points — all on threes — in a 63-second span late in the third quarter, coming off the bench and firing over and over and over again. And then he opened the fourth quarter with another three, giving him 34 points in just under 14 minutes played to that point. \nIt looked like he was a cinch for MVP honors, until Davis scored 20 points in the fourth. “He did a good job,” Westbrook said, “and got it done.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T12:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T07:22:52.973+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
