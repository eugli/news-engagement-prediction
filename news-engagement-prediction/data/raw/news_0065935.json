Again. Just 48 hours ago, Chris Fields dropped out of the fight in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and was replaced by Vladimir Filipovic . On Wednesday, however, it was announced Filipovic, a native of Serbia, was out due to visa issues. So Brett McDermott will take his place in the main event. SevereMMA.com initially reported the news. McDermott (7-4) will be making his Bellator debut. Six of his seven career victories are via knockout, with his most notable win a finish of Bellator vet Oli Thompson . McGeary (11-1), also a Brit, has 10 stoppages among his 11 career wins. Heâ€™s looking to get back on track after dropping the title to Phil Davis in November.
