The Houston Press reports that Hamburger Mary’s, a California-based bar known for its drag performances, massive cocktails, and cheekily-named entrees, will soon open its doors at 2409 Grant Street in Montrose . First opened in 1972 in San Francisco, the Houston outpost joins locations of the bar in Wisconsin, Florida, Colorado, and Missouri. As far as the food is concerned, look forward to a menu of entrees inspired by gay icons, like the Barbarella-Q bacon cheeseburger and Buffy The Burger Slayer . Dessert options include deep-fried twinkies, “defloured” chocolate cake, and “Mary Tyler S’mores.” Cocktail offerings are equally epic, and if the West Hollywood location is any indication, drinkers can look forward to a massive, $150 “total top” margarita mixed with Gran Patron and Grand Marnier. Hamburger Mary’s is set to make its debut on February 24, at which time you’ll be able to enjoy those wacky burgers & drinks while watching Houston’s finest drag queens.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T00:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:24:46.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
