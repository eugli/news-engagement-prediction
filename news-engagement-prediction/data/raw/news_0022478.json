Though, Thicke was still permitted three supervised visits a week, according to the documents. At the time, Thicke's lawyer called Patton’s accusations “nothing more than a retaliatory move” against Thicke due to the singer preparing to seek sole custody of Julian. He also accused Patton of keeping Julian away from his father and “manipulating and coercing” their son into being “afraid” of Thicke.
