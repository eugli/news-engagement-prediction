Edinson Cavani scored twice and Angel Di Maria netted the other as Unai Emery's side kept pace with Monaco at the top of the Ligue 1 table. Ronaldinho: PSG can test Barcelona Despite picking up the victory to keep them three points off first place, Ben Arfa was unhappy with Carcedo's approach, criticising him in the tunnel after the game. The Spanish coach attempted to talk to the former Newcastle United winger, but was cut short, with Ben Arfa snapping \"You hurt my head. You are shouting too loudly. Let us play. Why do you shout like this?” \"Tu cries trop fort ! Laisse-nous jouer !\" #Jplus1 pic.twitter.com/7udEWEPWz7 — J+1 (@jplusun) February 12, 2017 Ben Arfa came off the bench in the win, playing just 18 minutes as PSG already had the points guaranteed. He has been a fringe figure in Emery's squad this season, starting just five times in Ligue 1, and being forced to contribute from the bench - 14 of his 19 appearances have come as a substitute. Ben Arfa has also failed to score for PSG since joining from Nice in July.
