MSNBC host Brian Williams previewed the survey's results on his show late Tuesday.\nIn another question, the majority of American adults said they support Trump's executive order that temporarily suspended immigration from seven countries in the Middle East and North Africa. That action has since been halted by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Approximately 47 percent of respondents said they disapproved the move.\nFull results of the online poll of more than 11,000 people will be released Wednesday morning. The results had a 1.4 percentage point margin of error.\nSubscribe today to get intelligence and analysis on defense and national security issues in your Inbox each weekday morning from veteran journalists Jamie McIntyre and Jacqueline Klimas.\nSorry, there was a problem processing your email signup.
