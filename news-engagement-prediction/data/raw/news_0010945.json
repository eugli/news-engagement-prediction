I felt like I wanted to be different.” \nThis limited offering features a few notable changes from the original basketball shoe, including extra padding to provide additional comfort and support around the ankle, Jumpman logo on the tongue, Nike Free-inspired outsole with soft spikes and a fully waterproof upper. \nThe Air Jordan I golf shoe will be available in two colorways (white/black/varsity red and white/metallic silver) beginning Feb. 10 at nike.com and select retailers for a suggested retail price of $200.
