He is expected to appear at Dundee Sheriff Court today. Missing Ralphie's aunt Julie McCash died at the family gathering (Photo: Facebook) \nThe family vigil came after Ralphie fell from the cliffs while he was out walking with his dad. \nA family member, who asked not to be named, said: “It’s possible the noise from the winds upset Ralphie and he’s ran off away from his dad. He probably didn’t realise they were walking near to the cliff edge. \n“Ralphie was autistic and the wind noise might have spooked him. \n“It’s a terrible tragedy. His parents are distraught.” \nIt’s understood Ralphie’s mum, Nicola Duffy, is being comforted by relatives in Dundee along with his 11-year-old brother Kane. \nPolice have extended their search for the teenager, with teams operating up and down the coastline around the town of Arbroath. Family member David Sorrie was also killed (Photo: Facebook) \nLifeboats and a rescue helicopter have also been involved in the search. \nJulie and David are believed to have been stabbed at around 6am yesterday. \nIt’s not known what sparked the violence, but a family member said: “It was horrendous. I don’t want to go into too much detail because the family are just shattered by it all.” \nLast night, one of David’s close pals told how the Dundee gathering was organised after Ralphie went missing. \nThe friend – who wished to remain nameless – confirmed that Ralphie was stab victim Julie’s nephew. \nHe said: “I was at the gathering that was arranged to offer support to family members. Rab Stratton, 42, was later arrested and charged in connection with the two deaths (Photo: Facebook) \n“When I left, Julie and David were chatting away happily. I couldn’t believe the news when I woke up this morning because as well as dealing with what happened to Ralphie, we’re now coming to terms with what happened later on.” \nHe added: “It’s all come as a huge shock to everyone. Julie was a really popular person who was very happy-go-lucky and always the life and soul.” \nPolice cordoned off one end of Drumlanrig Drive in Dundee after the early-morning deaths. \nA blue forensics tent was erected on the road outside one property before being moved to another location nearby in the middle of the afternoon. \nOfficers in white suits carried out their own investigations while locals were briefly allowed into the cordon to lay flowers close to the scene. \nA police spokesman confirmed the deaths and said: “Police Scotland attended at the Drumlanrig Drive area of Dundee following reports of the deaths of two people, a 32-year-old man and a 43-year-old woman, on Sunday, February 26, 2017. \n“A 42-year-old man has been detained in connection with the incident and inquiries are ongoing.” \nDetective Chief Inspector Keith Hardie, from Police Scotland’s major investigation team, added: “There will be a strong police presence in the area while our investigation continues and I’d like to thank the community in advance for their patience. \n“I would also like to take this opportunity to stress that this has been a contained and isolated incident. There has been no threat to the wider public at any stage. \n“I would urge anyone with information to contact police. \n“Likewise anyone who saw or heard anything in the area that could be of assistance, please contact police as soon as possible.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T13:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T09:03:10.439+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
