And watch out, Honolulu â€” we're coming for you next. \nAccording to a new study by U.S. News & World Report, Indianapolis is the No. 55 best place to live in the United States. That puts us ahead of huge cities like New York City (No. 80), Chicago (No. 83) and L.A. (No. 88) and within striking distance of Honolulu (No. 46). \n\"Indianapolis is a great place to visit,\" the report says. \"But what makes Indy such a splendid place to stop over makes it an even better place to live.\" \nU.S. News & World Report made the determination by looking at five categories. Here's how Indy fared in each of them: Desirability Index: 5.0/10. This category, based on a survey asking people where they would most like to live, was Indy's lowest score. That's OK, we're used to being an underdog. Value: 7.9/10. This was Indy's highest score. It was calculated by looking at several factors to determine the annual household income and the annual cost of living. Job Market: 6.7/10. This score combines the unemployment rate with the average annual salary. Quality of Life Index: 6.0/10.This takes into account crime rates, quality and availability of healthcare, quality of education, well-being ( remember that study that said Indiana was 47th for well-being? It uses that same stat) and commute times. Net Migration: 6.4/10. Uses Census data to see how many people are moving into Indy vs. out of it. Total score: 6.5/10 \nTl;dr version: Indiana's greatest strength is its low cost of living and decent job market. On the downside, most people don't actually want to live here. \nStill not sold on Indy? Here's what the study said were the 10 best places to live in the U.S.: \n1.
