Niles West's Jacob Bobiles competes in the 100-yard freestyle at the Niles North Sectional on Saturday in Skokie. (Kevin Tanaka / Pioneer Press) Steve Reaven Pioneer Press \nNiles West's Sam Paloma and Jacob Bobiles each ended their junior seasons on high notes at the Niles North Sectional, setting several personal records. \nThe meet on Saturday served dual purposes. \nIt gave each a taste of how they stack up against other top swimmers in the area. And they also now have a better idea of what they need to do to take the next step. \n\"I know for a fact now I have to do the whole offseason â€” summer workouts, fall workouts. If I do that, making it to state can be done,\" said Paloma, a Morton Grove resident. \nThat's the ultimate goal for both. \nPaloma's best shot will likely be in the 100-yard backstroke. He trimmed almost 10 seconds off his best time as a sophomore this season. His fifth-place finish in 55.49 seconds at the sectional left him just over two seconds from the state qualifying standard. \nHe also set a career-best in the 200 individual medley at the sectional with a time of 2:05.68 (11th). The 50 backstroke leg he swam on the 200 medley relay also was his fastest ever (25.70). \nBobiles set personal records in the 50 free and the 100 free (49.23, 10th) at the sectional. His time of 22.14 in the 50 free was only .28 seconds away from the state standard. That's a gap he said he's confident can be bridged. \n\"It's all about the determination to get the work done yourself,\" said Bobiles, who resides in Skokie. \"There can't be any excuses or anything that holds you back.\" \nNiles West finished sixth at the sectional. Diver Brendan O'Shaughnessy, a senior, advanced to state. Sophomore Kyle Avenir also qualified for state in four events for athletes with disabilities. \nSteve Reaven is a freelance reporter for Pioneer Press. \nTwitter @Pioneer_Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:35:12.269+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
