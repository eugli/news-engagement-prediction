Nevertheless, there's nearly something in there for every Star Wars fan. \nThe Star Wars Humble Bundle II has been posted up over on the Humble Bundle store . You'll have just a little less than two weeks to get in on the deal, as there are 12 days remaining as of the writing of this article before the bundle expires. \nThey've managed to move more than 28,000 bundles featuring the Star Wars games. There are various tiers and you get some quality titles in each one. \nThe \"Pay what you want!\" tier grants you access to BioWare's Xbox classic, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic , X-Wing Alliance, X-Wing vs Tie Fighter and Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds . The last game probably isn't very well known because it came out at a time where a lot of companies were moving away from PC, and it was an RTS game that launched while consoles were just cleaning up the market with blockbusters such as Halo: Combat Evolved , GTA III, Final Fantasy X , ICO and Metal Gear Solid 2 . It's no surprise that a real-time strategy game on PC like Galactic Battlegrounds would get lost in the shuffle. It's also a reminder that 2001 had some really awesome games that came out. \nFurther up the bundle list are various other Star Wars titles available to unlock for $10.48. This tier includes all of the previously aforementioned games as well as Star Wars: Battlefront II, Star Wars: Jedi Outcast (Jedi Knight II), Star Wars Starfighter, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II and Rebel Assault I and Rebel Assault II . \nMost of those games are decent except for Star Wars: Starfighter . The game was an extremely bare bones, boring space sim that was completely unremarkable. On the upside, all of the cool space battle action you could want can be found in the PC version of Star Wars: Battlefront II . The game is still beloved by the gaming community more than a decade on from its release, and the modding community has some amazing mods worth checking out that extend the game well beyond what Pandemic intended. \nNow, personally, I was never a big fan of the Rebel Assault games. I thought they were pretty limited and difficult to play, but they were still popular on PC nonetheless. For gamers looking to take a bite out of nostalgia, at least the Rebel Assault games are included. \nThe final tier on the bundle includes the $14 pack, which consists of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed I and II , Star Wars: Rogue Squadron 3D, Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire , and Star Wars: Empire at War: Gold Pack . \nI'm sure some people groaned at the inclusion of The Force Unleashed games, but for $14 you're roughly getting 14 games. That basically break down to $1 a game. Now if you really want something extra you can plop down $35 to get a blue and red X-Wing vs Tie Fighter t-shirt. Again, you have just less than two weeks to get your hands on this Star Wars bundle.
