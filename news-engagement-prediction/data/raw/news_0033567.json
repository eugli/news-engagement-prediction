First of all, the show’s leading lady Deepika Singh has fallen out with the show-runners over her paycheque. Image Source: instagram/deepikasingh She has since refused to return to the franchise for part two of the TV soap. After that, Sumeet-Shashi suffered another setback when Star Plus demoted the planned show from the prime time slot of 9 PM to 2o’clock in the afternoon.Sources tell us that the top brass at Star Plus decided to move the show because they were not confident that it will get the same TRPs as the original show.It looks like this show will go the same route as Iss Pyaar Ko Main Kya Naam Doon, starring Sanaya Irani and Barun Sobti. Image Source: tellynews The first season of the show became a fan favourite and the talk of the town. And the second season shifted from prime time to the 6 pm slot.In the case of that show too, the show’s lead, Sanaya, had kicked the show and moved on to a new project while Barun too had a fall-out with the channel.And then the audience rejected the show as it did not live upto the standards set by its predecessor.
