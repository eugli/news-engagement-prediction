While the winners were most certainly deserved , there seems to be a bit of uproar about how Beyoncé, who performed at the show , didn’t take home the coveted Album of the Year award. Indeed, even Adele, who DID win the award, apologized to Beyoncé , and later said that Lemonade was her album of the year , regardless. Despite this, however, Beyoncé DID pick up two awards last night, and her acceptance speech is so darn moving. \nBey picked up the awards for Best Music Video and Best Urban Contemporary Album, and it was her speech for the latter that literally brought a tear to our eyes. \nDressed in gold and reading from a matching gold card that held her acceptance speech, Queen B thanked the Academy and all those involved in making her iconic and powerful visual album Lemonade . \n“Thank you to the Grammy voters for this incredible honor,” she said. “Thank you everyone who worked so hard to beautifully capture the profundity of deep Southern culture. I thank God for my family, my wonderful husband, my beautiful daughter, my fans for bringing me so much happiness and support.” \nContinuing, the star went on to talk about the intentions behind the record. “We all experience pain and loss and often we become inaudible,” she said. “My intention for the film and album was to create a body of work that will give a voice to our pain, our struggles, our darkness, and our history – to confront issues that make us uncomfortable.” \nFinishing up, Beyoncé spoke about how she felt it was important to show her children images that reflect them. “It’s important to me to show images to my children that reflect their beauty, so they can grow up in a world where they look in the mirror – first through their own families, as well as the news, the Super Bowl, the Olympics, the White House, and the Grammys, and see themselves, and have no doubt that they’re beautiful, intelligent, and capable.\n“This is something I want for every child of every race, and I feel it’s vital that we learn from the past and recognize our tendencies to repeat our mistakes,” she finished. \nWatch Beyoncé’s powerful acceptance speech below. \nOmg isn’t Blue Ivy just SO cute!? \nWhile she might not have picked up the big award of the night, we love how humble and clearly shocked Beyoncé was at winning the award. Also, we love how she used her platform to speak about the themes of the album. Pure class and 100% deserved.
