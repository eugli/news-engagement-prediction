(Evan Vucci/AP Photo) \nSince coming into office, President Donald Trump has signed a series of executive orders and presidential memoranda aimed at putting into motion some of his biggest campaign promises, including construction of a border wall, a ban on immigration from certain Muslim-majority nations and the unwinding of the Affordable Care Act and the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. As is perhaps to be expected, Republicans in Congress have largely favored the president's moves, while Democrats have issued charges of illegality and executive overreach, reversing the roles each played under the Obama administration. \n“Most of these orders relate right now to the executive branch, and I don’t think he’s trying to legislate through them,” said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., recently. “If our Democratic friends think that they’ll do what we did – they’ll take him to court and they’ll win some and they’ll lose some.\" Already, Trump's immigration ban, the highest profile order he's signed thus far, has gotten bogged down in the courts. \nSome experts have also criticized the White House for not going through the proper legal channels or relevant agencies when crafting its orders. \"If you don’t run these kinds of initiatives through the affected agencies, you’re going to get something wrong,” David Vladeck, a law professor at Georgetown University and a former official at the Federal Trade Commission, told Politico. “A government by edict is not a sustainable idea.\" \nStill, executive orders are not a new tool: Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan each issued hundreds of them during their respective terms. “While I may disagree with Trump in various areas, I think it’s important in the first 100 days for presidents to show action,” Stuart Eizenstat, an attorney for both the Carter and Clinton administrations, told The Intercept. “As long as they’re not abused, they’re perfectly permissible and even useful to set the tone of a new administration. That’s what he was elected to do.\" \nSo have Trump's executive orders gone too far?
