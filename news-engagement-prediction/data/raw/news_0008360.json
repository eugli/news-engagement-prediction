Rai was held guilty of money laundering to the tune of Rs 3.72 crore and was given the maximum punishment under PMLA. The court observed that in case the former minister failed to deposit Rs 5 lakh in fine, the sentence of seven years will be extended by 18 months. \n\nRai was a minister in the cabinets of chief ministers Arjun Munda, Madhu Koda and Shibu Soren between 2005 and 2008 and held various portfolios including tourism, urban development and forest and environment. This is the first instance where the ED, the nodal agency to prosecute people charged with money laundering under PMLA, has been successful in getting a conviction order. The agency is probing several other high-profile politicians under PMLA, including a few former Union ministers and chief ministers. \n\nRai was first chargesheeted by the Jharkhand vigilance bureau and later by the CBI, holding him guilty of acquiring disproportionate assets. The ED initiated an investigation under PMLA against Rai and other associates in September 2009. \n\nThe probe found that Rai, as minister in the Jharkhand government, misappropriated public money and laundered it through purchase and acquisition of various immovable and movable assets in the name of his wife and other associates. He ran a construction company, Mahamaya Construction Pvt Ltd, in his wife Sushila Devi's name. \n\nAnother firm, Maa Gauri Construction, was managed by his brother Sanjay Kumar Rai. Other ventures were launched in the names of his wife and brother. Rai was held guilty under Section 3 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act and the court allowed confiscation of his properties.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T11:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:12:55.622+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
