A big change coming \nWith stars like Paige, Summer Rae and Dana Brooke also making up the division but not having been seen on WWE TV for some time, the division could be set for one big change in the coming weeks. \nJOIN THE DEBATE \nShould WWE turn Sasha Banks heel?

Article continues below Arsenal fans react furiously to Aaron Ramsey's 17-minute performance vs Watford \nDave Meltzer reported on Sunday Night that Banks is expected to turn heel relatively soon and should enter WrestleMania in the same role. \nAs for what her match could become at WrestleMania is anyone's guess, however it is highly expected that she will be facing Bayley in some capacity. \nBanks' backstage segment with Bayley on Monday's episode of RAW showed her already turning away from the advice of her friend. \nIf Banks does turn heel and is set to face Bayley at WrestleMania, a singles match would mean that it would be without the Women's Championship on the line. \nThen again, a triple threat Women's Championship match wouldn't be out of the question, as that same scenario received positive feedback at last year's show. A lack of Faces? \nIf Banks is to turn heel in the coming weeks, it could leave RAW with a very unbalanced women's division in terms of face and heel superstars. \nWhile Charlotte, Nia Jax, and Banks all would be working as heels, Bayley would be the sole face superstar in the division. \nHowever with over a month until the Fastlane PPV and WrestleMania two months away, there is still time for other superstars to change character, or for someone from NXT to make their mark on RAW. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
