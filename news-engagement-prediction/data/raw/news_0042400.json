The UN has voiced concern about civilians trapped there, amid reports that they could number up to 650,000. \nExperts warn that western Mosul, although slightly smaller than the east, is more densely populated and includes districts that are seen as pro-IS. Retaking of eastern Mosul, 18 January \nLt Gen Stephen Townsend, the task force's commander, described the recapture of eastern Mosul as a \"monumental achievement\" for the Iraqi people. \nHe praised the way Iraqi security personnel, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, Sunni Arab tribesmen and Shia militiamen, assisted by US-led coalition warplanes and military advisers, had come together to fight a common enemy. \nHowever, Gen Townsend warned: \"There is still a long way to go before [IS] is completely eliminated from Iraq, and the fight for western Mosul is likely to be even tougher than the eastern side.\" \nThe Mosul offensive was launched on 17 October , more than two years after jihadists overran the city before seizing control of much of northern and western Iraq. \nOn 1 November , Iraqi government forces reached the outskirts of Mosul, but they encountered fierce resistance from IS snipers, suicide bombers and shellfire. \nBad weather also hampered their advance, with poor visibility limiting the ability of aircraft to provide cover. \nIt took until 8 January 2017 for the Iraqi forces to advance as far as the River Tigris and another two weeks to gain full control of the eastern side of the city. \nElsewhere in the region, the Shia-dominated, paramilitary Popular Mobilisation force has been advancing westwards towards the town of Tal Afar and the border with Syria. Territory held around Mosul, 23 January \nDr Michael Knights of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy said that unless there was an \"unexpectedly rapid collapse of IS\", the clearance of west Mosul could stretch \"well into the second quarter of 2017\". \nAlthough tens of thousands of people fled their homes in and around Mosul as troops pushed into the east, the UN says about 550,000 chose to remain in their homes. \nThe UN says almost half of all the casualties from Mosul have been civilians. At least 1,096 have been killed and 694 injured across Nineveh province since the start of October. Territorial loss \nAccording to analysis by IHS Conflict Monitor , IS fighters have been losing territory since the offensive began. However, gains slowed when Iraqi government forces met stiff resistance in the city of Mosul. \nSatellite images have revealed extensive damage to Mosul's infrastructure, buildings and archaeological sites . Mosul's bridges \nIn the centre of the city, four of the five main bridges were put out of action in October and November by coalition air strikes, with the aim of limiting the jihadists' ability to resupply or reinforce their positions in the east. \nThe Old Bridge - the only remaining route open to vehicles in the centre of the city - was disabled in a US-led coalition air strike at the end of December. \nSatellite images, released by US geopolitical intelligence company Stratfor , show how the bridges have been damaged. \nAl Shohada Bridge \nThe US targeted the eastern end of the bridge with an air strike in November to stop IS forces from crossing, but IS has now damaged the western end to stop Iraqi forces from crossing. \nFifth Bridge \nIS forces appear to have blown up part of the bridge towards the eastern end in another bid to stop Iraqi forces from crossing to the western side. \nOld Bridge \nThis satellite image shows new damage at both ends of the Old Bridge. \nAl Jamhuriya Bridge Image copyright AP \nA US air strike damaged the bridge at the eastern end last October, but IS have since set up a barrier on the western side, shown below. \nFourth Bridge \nBack in November a US air strike damaged the bridge, but more recently it has been rendered impassable by further damage, shown below. Nineveh province administration building \nFurther Stratfor imagery taken on 31 October, shows how militants have destroyed mosques, government buildings and historical areas. \nThe Nineveh provincial administration building, which served as IS's municipal headquarters, has been flattened by explosives. \nImagery has also revealed how the jihadists have constructed multiple barricades across key routes into the city. IS barricades in southern Mosul \nThe barriers have been made out of concrete blocks and other rubble, Stratfor's analysis says, possibly from the walls of destroyed buildings. In other areas, the militants have stockpiled materials, ready to block roads as the battle nears. Humanitarian crisis \nThe International Committee for the Red Cross has warned that the offensive to retake Mosul could take months, prompting increasing numbers of civilians to leave to avoid becoming trapped between frontlines. \nMore than 160,000 people have now fled their homes in and around Mosul and UN officials are warning this figure is likely to rise as the Iraqi-led forces press further into the city. \nIn a worst-case scenario, the UN's refugee agency (UNHCR) warned that the crisis could displace up to one million people and 700,000 could need emergency shelter. Click to see content: mosul_idps \nMost of the people displaced from Mosul are staying in 13 camps and emergency sites. According to the UN, 10 of these camps are already full and four are being extended. Seven more are under construction. \nSome 1,500 civilians wounded in the fighting have been sent to Irbil's main hospitals for emergency care between 17 October 2016 and 11 January 2017, according to UN reports. \nIt says many of those who have fled Mosul and ended up in the camps have witnessed the deaths of relatives, friends and neighbours. Children are showing severe signs of trauma - such as excessive crying, mutism, bed-wetting and fear of leaving their parents. \nFood, water and medical aid are also being delivered to vulnerable families living in newly-recaptured town and villages, which have been experiencing severe shortages of supplies.
