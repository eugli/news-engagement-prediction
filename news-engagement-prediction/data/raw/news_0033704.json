The North conducted two nuclear tests and a slew of rocket launches last year in continued efforts to expand its nuclear weapons and missile programmes. Trump blacks out windows to stop media filming his golf round \nSpeaking at one of Mr Trump's golf resorts in Florida, Mr Abe said: \"North Korea's most recent missile launch is absolutely intolerable. President Trump and I myself completely share the view that we are going to promote further cooperation between the two nations. And also we are going to further reinforce our alliance.\" \nNorth Korea must fully comply with all UN Security Council resolutions, he added. \nKim Jong-un's regime has been subject to harsh economic sanctions, including restrictions on coal shipments, because of its weapons testing. \nAnd the country's highest-profile defector, Thae Yong-ho, the former deputy ambassador in London, has said Mr Kim hopes to control a functioning nuclear arsenal by the end of this year. \nMr Abe and Mr Trump's joint statement was made at the Jupiter golf club, which the US President owns. Journalists in the White House press pool tweeted images of windows that had been blacked out to prevent them from photographing the leaders' round of golf . \nThe US Strategic Command said it detected and tracked what it assessed was a medium- or intermediate-range ballistic missile test-fired by the North, which did not post a risk to America. The command said the launch occurred near the northwestern city of Kusong. \nMr Kim warned in his New Year's address that his country was ready to test its first intercontinental ballistic missile, which could threaten the US mainland. \nSouth Korea said the launch launch, along with the New Year's address threat, showed the \"irrational nature\" of a government \"fanatically\" obsessed with developing nuclear ballistic missiles. \nThe South's Foreign Ministry condemned the launch as a \"blatant and obvious\" violation of UN Security Council resolutions and a \"serious threat\" to international security. \nThe ministry said the South would continue to work with allies including the US, Japan and the European Union to ensure a thorough implementation of sanctions against the North and make the country realise that it will \"never be able to survive\" without discarding all of its nuclear and missile programmes. \nAdditional reporting by agencies.
