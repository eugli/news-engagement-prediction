The protected bird, which had evidently been hit, landed close to the police Land Rover. \nA hunter suddenly appeared and approached the police officers. He insisted that he was not the culprit. \nBirdlife volunteers, who were keeping watch over the area at the time confirmed that the man who had allegedly shot down the eagle was indeed someone else. They had observed the culprit, a bare-chested man, through a telescope and had even recorded him on camera. \nThe witness recalled how he had searched for the accused who was soon traced, disarmed and taken in for questioning. \nThe officer recognized the accused as the man whom he had arrested. \nInspector Pierguido Saliba prosecuted.
