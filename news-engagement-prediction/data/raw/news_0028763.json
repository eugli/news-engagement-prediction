The weapons test represented Trump’s first true high-pressure national security situation, especially since North Korea poses a direct threat to Japan. \nAs CNN reported, Trump and Abe sat in the main dining area — surrounded by paid club members — and discussed the incident while pouring over confidential documents with members of Trump’s staff, including National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and chief strategist Steve Bannon: \nBut as he sat down for the planned working dinner with Abe, whose country is well within range of North Korea’s missiles, it was clear his counterpart felt it necessary to respond to the test.
