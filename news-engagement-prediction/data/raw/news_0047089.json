Those effects could also benefit straight teens but more research is needed to determine how the laws might influence teen behavior, Raifman said. \nThe researchers analyzed data on more than 700,000 public high school students who participated in government surveys on risky youth behavior from 1999 through 2015, the year the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage. \nAbout 230,000 students reported being gay, lesbian or bisexual. \nThe surveys didn’t ask about transgender status. They included questions about suicide attempts, smoking and alcohol or drug use. \nIn 32 states that enacted same-sex marriage laws during the study, suicide attempts dropped 7 percent among all students and 14 percent among gay kids after the laws were passed. There was no change in suicide attempts in states without those laws. \nThe study only included suicide attempts, not deaths. \nThe new work makes an important contribution to identifying how laws limiting gay rights may affect psychological and physical health, said Columbia University public health researcher Mark Hatzenbuehler. \nBut more research is needed to determine which teens are most vulnerable to policies that limit gay rights, he wrote in an accompanying editorial.
