Sheahan/Mayo Clinic/AP Image caption At the medical centre before his face transplant surgery \nMr Sandness, from Wyoming, was left with a face almost completely destroyed after his attempt on his life in 2006. \nAfter extensive surgery, he still told people he had been in a hunting accident to explain his appearance. Image copyright AP Image caption Mr Sandness says he instantly knew he had made a terrible mistake after his suicide attempt in 2006 \nMr Ross, who lived in Minnesota, did not survive when he shot himself in early June 2016, leaving behind a pregnant and devastated widow, Lily. \nShe was committed to fulfilling her late husband's wish to be an organ donor but was uneasy about the prospect of another man taking his face. \n\"I didn't want to walk around and all of a sudden see Calen,\" she told the Associated Press. \nBut she gave her consent after being reassured that Mr Sandness had his own eyes and forehead and would not be identifiable as her husband.

The two say they are as close as brothers \nDr Samir Mardani, a specialist in facial reconstruction, spent more than 50 Saturdays over three years practising the surgery and transplanting the faces of cadaver heads. \nThey had estimated it would take years to find a matching donor, but five months after Mr Sandness was put on a donor waiting list - a match, in Mr Calen, was found. \nThe delicate and complex procedure included identifying nerve branches on the faces of both men and using electric currents to determine their function - smiling, or opening and closing the eyes, for example.

But he has written her a letter, in which he spoke of her husband's favourite things. \n\"He's still going to continue to love hunting and fishing and dogs - through me,\" he wrote.
