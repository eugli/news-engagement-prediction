NBA Australia \nPublished on Feb. 2, 2017 \nUpdated at 2:05 a.m. ET \nA little splash can go a long way, or is it a lot of splash from far away? Either way, the Dubs hit a lot of threes and kept the Hornets at bay. \nMORE: Thon Maker has 12 points, 3 blocks in Bucks loss to Jazz \nStephen Curry picked up where he left off on Sunday, connecting on a seemingly endless supply of three-pointers in the Dubs’ 126-111 victory over the Hornets at Oracle Arena today. \nAfter knocking down nine threes in his last game on Saturday – he didn’t play Sunday due to sickness – Curry had an even hotter hand on Wednesday, and he wasted little time in getting warmed up. \nCurry hit the Dubs’ first two shots – both three-pointers – and the splash party was on. \nThe Dubs made five three-pointers before they made a two-point basket with 8:24 left in the opening period. The Warriors would make seven of their first eight three-point attempts, and they wound up matching a franchise record with nine treys in the period. \nNot surprisingly, it was Curry leading the way, making six three-pointers during a 41-point first period, the Warriors’ NBA-best 14th quarter with 40-plus points. But it turns out Curry was just getting started. \nThe two-time reigning MVP went 11-for-15 from distance, finishing the game with 39 points in 30 minutes before sitting out the entire fourth quarter. A whole lot of #SPLASH to start this one.

He contributed six 3-pointers of his own during a 29-point night, but his scoring was just part of the story. Thompson matched a career-high with eight assists, a stat that made his coach proud. \n“When Klay is putting it on the floor and finding people, the game really opens up for us,” Kerr said. \nWith the Dubs clicking offensively – they hit 21 3-pointers and had 35 assists on 47 made shots – it may have been easy to overlook a defensive effort that included 12 blocks. Starting in place of injured Zaza Pachulia, JaVale McGee tallied four blocks, and that total was matched by Draymond Green. — GoldenStateWarriors (@warriors) February 2, 2017 \nBy no means did this game lack for highlights, and one of the top ones came courtesy of Damian Jones. The rookie out of Vanderbilt tallied his first NBA basket, a dunk set up by a drive from James Michael McAdoo. \nNow 42-7 on the season, the Warriors head to Southern California to complete the back end of a back-to-back on Thursday against the Clippers.
