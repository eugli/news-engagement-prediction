All of the centers returned to normal operations, Posner said in a statement. \nThe FBI was investigating the incidents, Posner said. \nOfficials at the FBI were not immediately available for comment. \nOfficials at the Harry and Rose Samson Family Jewish Community Center in Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin, north of Milwaukee, received a bomb threat at 10:15 a.m. local time, the second such incident at the center over the last three weeks, it said on Twitter. \n\"Taking very cautious measures, we are sheltering in our gym, as has been recommended,\" the Milwaukee JCC said in a text message sent to parents of children who attend the preschool at the center, according to an NBC affiliate in Milwaukee. \nThe center reopened two hours later, the center said on Twitter. \nMonday's incidents come after three waves of bomb threats in 2017. In all, 69 incidents at 54 JCCs in 27 states and one Canadian province have been reported, according to the JCC Association of North America. \n\"We are concerned about the anti-Semitism behind these threats, and the repetition of threats intended to interfere with day-to-day life,\" Posner said. \nJewish community centers typically offer after-school activities, fitness programs and various other services. \nOver the weekend, the headstones at the graves of about 170 Jews were vandalized in the St. Louis area, the Washington Post reported. \n(Reporting by Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee; Editing by Robert Birsel) Next In U.S.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T13:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:21:50.461+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
