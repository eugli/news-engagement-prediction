Jacob pins hopes on home-ground advantage Photo: Mr Jacob was born and bred in Perth's northern suburbs. (ABC News: Andrew O'Connor) \nFrom a bunker-like room \"somewhere in Currambine\", Mr Jacob is waging his campaign to hold his northern suburbs seat of Burns Beach, desperate to win his third term in Parliament and give Premier Colin Barnett a record third term in government. \nThe Environment Ministerwas just 28 when he stepped into politics as an idealistic change agent, rising quickly through the Liberal ranks to become the Barnett Government's youngest Cabinet minister. \nEver since, the married father-of-two has found himself balancing the competing demands of being a local member and a high-profile Cabinet minister. He is now facing his biggest electoral challenge. Photo: Mr Jacob was the youngest member of the Barnett Cabinet. (ABC News: Andrew O'Connor) \nMr Jacob hopes to capitalise on the fact he was born and raised in Perth's north, and has spent his two terms in government working to deliver on a commitment to his local community. \nBut if he has a home-ground advantage against his Labor opponent, police officer Mark Folkard, he knows in this election, he is going to need it. \nIn 2013, he rode a wave of anti-Labor sentiment to a second election victory, recording the state's largest swing, and boosting his margin to 16.3 per cent. This time, it is a very different picture. \nA redistribution of his electorate boundaries has cut that margin to 11.3 per cent. \nThe polls show the Liberals swimming against an electoral tide, with swings of up to 14 per cent to Labor forecast. \nIf that happens, the Barnett Government would be wiped out and Mr Jacob would be out of office. Photo: Mr Jacob says he's \"quietly confident\". (ABC News: Andrew O'Connor) \nBut taking a coffee break in Burns Beach, he says he believes his record as local MP, and the Barnett's record on delivering improved transport, health and education in the northern suburbs, will be enough to hang on. \n\"I'm still quietly confident off the back of what we've done and that we have a clear vision of what we want to do and we have the credibility to deliver it,\" he said. 10pc may not be enough for John Day Photo: Mr Day says he's not taking re-election for granted. (ABC News: Andrew O'Connor) \nOn the other side of town in the Perth Hills seat of Kalamunda, Liberal veteran Mr Day has traded the Cabinet table for a workshop lunch table, and a question-and-answer session with the blokes at the local Men's Shed. \nThose gathered around the table are genuinely engaged, and the conversation swings from debt and deficit to the need for more local aged care facilities. \nMr Day, who is both Health and Arts Minister sits on a 10.3 per cent margin. He should be safe, but with the forecast swings, he knows that he too could be in trouble on a election night. \n\"I don't take any election for granted at all,\" he said. \nOn top of a major redistribution that shaved suburbs like Maddington from his electorate and added new areas like Mundaring, the 24-year veteran of WA state politics knows he is facing a volatile and unpredictable electorate concerned about employment and the economy. \n\"It is quite a challenge to balance the duties as Health and Arts Minister together with all the local requirements and I'm very conscious that my electorate of Kalamunda is my number one priority from the local point of view,\" he said. Photo: Mr Day says the focus for Government should be on a return to surplus. (ABC News: Andrew O'Connor) \nOn the streets of Kalamunda he is making the case on local issues like the promised hospital upgrade, hoping to convince voters the state still needs the leadership of Mr Barnett. \n\"What's important in government is actually being effective and getting results. I don't seek to be spectacular or make a lot of noise, but I do seek to get results wherever that's reasonably possible to do so,\" he said. \nMr Day is acutely aware of the long shadow cast by the Government's record debt and deficits. \nHe came to office in 1993 in the wake of the WA Inc scandals, and used his maiden speech to warn of the dangers of debt. \n\"We need to ensure that our children and grandchildren can look to the future with confidence and without being burdened with excessive debt as a result of inappropriate spending,\" he told the Parliament in November 1993. \nHe still stands by that view, but argues the Barnett Government has spent its borrowed billions appropriately. \n\"What we need to do is ride it out — this downturn — and things will change, over the next few years so that we at least get back into a surplus situation and then we can start paying down debt,\" he said. 'I have given Wanneroo 100pc': Miles Photo: Mr Miles says the Government has delivered real benefits for the northern suburbs. (ABC News: Andrew O'Connor) \nMr Miles' seat of Wanneroo is another of the Liberal's northern suburbs strongholds looking vulnerable on March 11. \nLike Mr Jacob, the Minister for Local Government, Community Services, Seniors, Volunteering and Youth was elected in 2008 and has only ever sat on the government benches. \nWanneroo is a bellwether seat, going with every government in the seven elections since it was created in 1989. \nMr Miles also enjoys a double-digit margin of 11 per cent but knows if the swing against the Government takes hold, it could sweep through the Liberals swag of northern suburbs seats, wiping him out. \nThe one-time local councillor turned local MP was elevated to the Barnett Cabinet last September in the reshuffle that followed Dean Nalder's failed attempt to topple the Premier. \nMr Miles chats casually with the members of the Wanneroo seniors group, a vibrant and active assembly of local citizens who have seen elections and politicians come and go. \nThey are less interested in what he had done as Minister than what he can do for them as their local member. Photo: Mr Miles says he is not complacent about his 11 per cent margin. (ABC News: Andrew O'Connor) \nMr Miles believes the Government has delivered tangible benefits to the city's north, including freeway extensions, upgrading Joondalup hospital, and improved education services. \nHe knows securing a third term is tough, but does not believe people will reject him at the ballot box. \n\"There are always going to be people out there that say you've been there too long, or don't like your boss, or don't like your party but we just like you,\" he said. \n\"On election day, I know I will have given Wanneroo 100 per cent and I hope that Wanneroo will say 'we like this guy, we're going to keep him in place'.\" \nMr Miles will have his answer in three weeks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T05:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T08:11:50.436+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
