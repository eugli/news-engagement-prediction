We disagree with any effort to limit or rescind their rights and protections.\"\nThe statement comes just hours after the Trump administration reversed Obama-era policies requiring that public schools allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds with their gender identity. Trump's order Wednesday gives states and school districts the authority to decide whether federal sex discrimination law applies to gender identity.\nLike many tech companies, Apple is no stranger to voicing opposition to government decisions seen as allowing discrimination against people who are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. In March 2016, Apple CEO Tim Cook was among more than 90 business executives who spoke out against out a North Carolina law that would force transgender students to use school toilets \"inconsistent with their gender identity.\"\nCook, who announced in 2014 he is gay , has spoken out often against anti-LGBT legislation , and his name was featured on Alabama's anti-discrimination bill . The company has also been a frequent participant in San Francisco's annual Pride Parade, posting a video to YouTube of the many Apple employees who marched in the parade celebrating gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nSolving for XX : The industry seeks to overcome outdated ideas about \"women in tech.\"\n\nDoes the Mac still matter? Apple execs tell why the MacBook Pro was over four years in the making, and why we should care.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T09:01:47.566+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
