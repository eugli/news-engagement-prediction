Photo: Kin Man Hui, San Antonio Express-News Rockets clear cap space with two trade deadline moves 1 / 6 Back to Gallery \nThe Rockets on Thursday made two trade deadline moves to make another move, sending guard/forward K.J. McDaniels to the Brooklyn Nets' cap space and Tyler Ennis to the Lakers to set themselves up to be buyers when players become available in the coming days after expected buyouts, according to two individuals with knowledge of the deals. \nCenter Andrew Bogut, who was sent from Dallas to the Philadelphia 76ers, could be the most likely Rockets' target if he reaches a buyout with the Sixers to become a free agent as expected. \nThe Rockets received small cash considerations ($75,000) from the Nets in the deal for McDaniels . They will receive veteran guard Marcelo Huertas from the Lakers, but intend to waive Huertas with the goal of both moves to create the cap room for the buyout market, according to an individual with knowledge of the team's plans. \nWith the deals, the Rockets will have $3.5 million in cap space, more than other teams can offer in a \"room\" salary cap exception. The Rockets did not have a cap exception to use on a free agent. \nMcDaniels could not crack Mike D'Antoni's rotation, even when players at his positions were out with injuries. In three seasons with the Rockets since he was a trade deadline acquisition for guard Isaiah Canaan, McDaniels has played an average of just 6.3 minutes per game when he has played at all. McDaniels has played in just 29 games this season, averaging 2.8 points per game. \nEnnis, acquired in the off-season for Michael Beasley, was not in the rotation since early in the season. He played in 39 games this season, averaging 1.9 points and 1.1 rebounds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:15:12.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
