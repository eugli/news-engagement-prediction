This is a 2-in-1 rugged tablet which ship with a keyboard, and looks like it can take a punch. It’s worth mentioning that this is ARCHOS’ first rugged 2-in-1 tablet offering, and it’s aimed at outdoorsy people, those of you who like to hike, or perhaps work outdoors. In any case, let’s talk more about the device itself, shall we. \nThis tablet comes with a casing which can survive a drop from up to 1 meter, while the IP54 rating is also here, which means it is resistant to water and dust splashes. Do keep in mind that this rating does not mean you can submerge it under water or something of the sort. That being said, the ARCHOS 101 Saphir sports a 10.1-inch 1280 x 800 IPS display, 1GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. The device is fueled by MediaTek’s MT8163 64-bit quad-core SoC clocked at 1.5GHz, which comes with the Mali T720 MP2 GPU for graphics. A 5-megapixel camera is placed on the back of this tablet, and a 2-megapixel snapper can be found on its front side. Android 7.0 Nougat comes pre-installed on this tablet, and a 6,000mAh battery is also a part of this package. The device does offer a 3.5mm headphone jack as well, while you’re also getting a set of stereo speakers with this tablet. On its body, you’ll be able to find a micro HDMI port, while a Type-C USB port is there for charging. This tablet measures 265.4 x 181 x 13.4mm, while it weighs 600 grams. \nThe ARCHOS 101 Saphir will, much like the company’s 50 Graphite and 55 Graphite smartphones, be showcased at this year’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. The ARCHOS 101 Saphir will be released in June, along with the two aforementioned smartphones, and we’ll get far more info when it does. If you happen to be in Barcelona in the near future during MWC 2017, you’ll be able to find ARCHOS in Hall 6, Booth #60.
