What happened at last night left history smashed in pieces on the carpet. In 89 years of Oscar ceremonies, there has never been a blunder quite as mortifying as La La Land being presented with the Academy’s top honour in error. (It’s still not entirely clear how it happened, though it's now been revealed that the presenters, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway, were handed the backup copy of the Best Actress envelope by mistake.) \nAnd yet for this dumbfounding fiasco to happen in a year when the rightful winner is a film about stories that aren’t usually told, lives which regularly go unacknowledged – well, there’s a sweetness and rightness and perverse poetic perfection to it, too. Watch | La La Land mistakenly named as best picture 01:49 \nB arry Jenkins’s lyrical drama about a boy growing up black and gay in Miami was never an obvious Oscar contender. It’s lyrical and elusive and formally ambitious, with pin-drop silence where the grandstanding speeches would normally be. \nDamien Chazelle’s nostalgic musical, on the other hand, was immediately picked out as a likely recipient of the honour after its first screening at the Venice Film Festival six months ago. So when Dunaway read out its name, no one seemed particularly shocked. \nBut La La Land’s moment of victory turned out to a blissful dream-ballet reverie of what might have been – not unlike the film’s own fantastical grand finale, in fact, in which Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone skip and whirl through a stylised sound-stage world in which everything worked out right for them. Jordan Horowitz with Warren Beatty Credit: Getty \nI n the end, it was La La Land’s own producer, Jordan Horowitz, who had to make the correction on stage while holding the Oscar he thought he’d won mere seconds ago. It was an unthinkably grim outcome, handled with similarly unthinkable charm and good grace. As for me, sitting on the sofa in the early hours, I spat out my granola. \nOn the upside, the 2017 Oscars got their viral moment. On the downside, it’s one that calls the ceremony’s basic competence into question. (The Academy’s voters, on the other hand, can hold their heads high: in a very strong year, and with an obvious, perfectly respectable, \"easier\" winner right there for the taking, they really did choose the best film.) Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty Credit: PHIL MCCARTEN / AMPAS \nA ll of the very earnest talk about PricewaterhouseCoopers’ supposedly airtight behind-the-scenes operation now seems laughable, given the worst Oscar night mistake imaginable just played out for real, and was allowed to stand for two minutes – not to mention that the people milling around on stage, rather than the accountants, were left to straighten it out. \nAs Horowitz holds up the envelope to the cameras for proof, Beatty’s glazed smile of horror behind him says it all: if they gave out Oscars for faces, it would have been a shoo-in for best picture. \nNo wonder Beatty immediately asked the host, Jimmy Kimmel, if he could explain it wasn’t his fault before the speculation began in earnest – and sure enough, within minutes, the clip of him and Dunaway making the erroneous announcement was being scrutinised on social media like footage of the moon landings. The cast and makers of Moonlight take the stage Credit: Getty \nB eatty’s lengthy pause and look of wry confusion before Dunaway declared La La Land the winner had felt like an attempt to build tension: as things turned out, it was because the piece of paper had Emma Stone’s name on it, and he realised it was almost certainly the wrong one. Watch | How the internet reacted to the Oscars Best Picture mix-up 01:43 \nU ntil this moment, we were used to thinking about the great Oscar mistakes as the times the \"wrong film\" ended up winning – like Crash over Brokeback Mountain in 2006, or Shakespeare in Love over Saving Private Ryan in 1998. But last night’s unprecedented situation was almost the opposite of that: a all-time-direst cock-up the result of which was widespread rejoicing. \nEven if Moonlight’s name had been read out correctly the first time, it would have been one of those times you feel like you have to immediately rewind the tape, just to make sure it actually happened. Reality sensed the mood, and gave us an unforgettable moment to match it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T16:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T11:46:55.476+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
