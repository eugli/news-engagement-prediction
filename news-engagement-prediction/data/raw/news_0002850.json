Manchester City's Kevin De Bruyne celebrates scoring their first goal (Photo: AFP) West Ham \nPretty thankless task, not at fault, but West Ham could still improve on him. \nByram - 5 \nNutmegged by Sane on the second goal and is still cashing shadows. \nReid - 5 \nSaw West Ham’s defence fall apart all around him. It was a devastating night. \nFonte - 4 \nHad a nightmare debut. Outmuscled on one goal, conceded a penalty for another. David Silva of Manchester City scores his team's second goal (Photo: Getty) \nCresswell - 4 \nGave the ball away horribly before first goal. Hasn’t been good under Bilic. \nObiang - 4 \nGave the ball away horribly to Sane for the third goal. He was awful. \nNoble - 5 \nTried to set an early tone with some crunching tackles, can’t fault his commitment. \nAntonio - 5 \nStruggled to get into the game and make a real impact. Poor. \nLanzini - 5 \nBooked. He is supposed to be Payet’s successor. Not on this evidence. Manchester City's Gabriel Jesus scores their third goal (Photo: REUTERS) \nFeghouli - 4 \nFrustrating at times, you can see the potential, but is very inconsistent. \nCarroll - 6 \nBrilliant ball to send Cresswell clear, his presence always troubles opponents. \nSubstitutes \nFernandes, for Feghouli, 64 mins, 5. \nSnodgrass, for Obiang, 64 mins, 6. \nFletcher, for Carroll, 80 mins, 6. Manchester City's Yaya Toure scores his team's fourth goal from the penalty spot (Photo: AFP) Man City \nLong overdue chance ahead of Bravo. Gives defenders more confidence. \nSagna - 7 \nAlways solid and determined at right back. Kept West Ham quiet. \nStones - 7 \nMade an incredibly brave block, put his head in where it hurts to stop Reid. \nOtamendi - 7 \nStill looks a weak link at times as West Ham were dangerous on occasion. \nKolarov - 7 \nHad a comfortable night because West Ham were so bad. Easy street. \nToure - 8 \nImposing figure in City’s midfield. Can boss the game with his authority and vision. Sane goes past Mark Noble and Winston Reid (Photo: AFP) \nDe Bruyne - 8 \nFabulous counter attack and finish on the opening goal. Central role suits him. \nSane - 9 \nBrilliant run and assist to set up the second goal. Now we’re seeing his potential. \nSilva - 8 \nNice finish at the back post capped another typical classy midfield display.
