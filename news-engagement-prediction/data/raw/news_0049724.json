But Peele has some idea of how Obama, with whiskey in hand, would react while watching the news. \nLike the last time we saw Obama and his anger translator , it’s unexpected but most welcome. He doesn’t even need an anger translator this time. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:09:45.336+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
