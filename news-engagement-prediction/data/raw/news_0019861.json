Two men who found love in a hopeless place. Jose Mourinho and Willian were there for each other when no one else was. Love (or more accurately Roman Abramovich) ultimately tore them apart, but they have never forgotten those special times they spent together. And now they’re like Danny Zuco and Sandy. Flirting with at each other and thinking about some summer lovin’. The Star reports that Mourinho is set to return to his old club to rescue Willian from the clutches of his new man Antonio Conte, who doesn’t treat him right and seems to be more in love with Pedro and Victor Moses – the hussies. Willian has confirmed that his former boss already tried to lure him to Manchester United at the start of this season, but Conte refused. However, Jose does not give up on true love so easily and he is allegedly poised to make another attempt to sign Willian for a sum “in the region of £40m” – in a kind of strange role reversal of the time he offloaded Juan Mata to Old Trafford three years ago. Mourinho might need Willian around to cheer him up next season if the Express is right in predicting that Real Madrid will take David de Gea to the Bernabeu in the summer by meeting his £55m release clause. The goalkeeper gave little away when quizzed about the issue, saying, “The future no one knows. The future is the future.” He’s always coming out with weird philosophical stuff like that, De Gea. Very interesting guy. In further concerning news for Mourinho, the Sun reports that Antoine Griezmann will snub a move to Old Trafford if United fail to qualify for the Champions League. And he won’t fall for the same “just one season” line like his mate Paul Pogba. Arsenal have drawn up a shortlist of managers to replace Arsene Wenger because they fear the Frenchman will walk away from the Emirates in the summer, according to the Mirror . The four-man list is said to include Borussia Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel, Max Allegri of Juventus, Monaco’s Leonardo Jardim and Bayer Leverkusen coach Roger Schmidt, who is only getting 3 per cent of the vote in a Mirror poll on who Gunners fans want to be boss. Harsh. Elsewhere, Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has made Leicester winger Demerai Gray one of his top summer targets ( Mail ), Borussia Monchengladbach’s former Chelsea midfielder Thorgan Hazard is keen on a return to England ( Goal ) and Coventry City want to make a double swoop for legendary strikers Yakubu and Carlton Cole ( Mail ) amid unconfirmed rumours that Sky Blues manager Russell Slade is suffering from a rare medical condition that makes him think he is permanently living in the year 2008.
