Wheelchair user Lyndis Greatrix, 49, had no space to open her door because the Â£75,000 German sports car was parked in the way. She had driven her Ford C-max into one of the two priority bays at Pump Square in Boston town centre. When Lyndis Greatrix returned from her day out a white Porsche was wedged beside her vehicle (pictured) - it did not appear to be displaying a blue disabled parking badge Lyndis (pictured), who has multiple sclerosis, was forced to ask a passerby for help They are marked out with yellow lines giving extra room between each space to accommodate the access needs of the disabled drivers who use them. But when Lyndis returned from her day out the white Porsche 911 model was wedged beside her vehicle - and did not appear to be displaying a blue disabled parking badge. She had no way of getting into her car and was forced to ask a passerby for help. She said: 'It was pretty obvious that the bay wasn't for parking and is needed to allow disabled drivers room to get their wheelchairs in and out their cars' They climbed into the driver's seat from the passenger side and reversed the vehicle out so she could get in. Lyndis, who has multiple sclerosis, said: 'The photo shows my car, The red C-max, correctly parked and another that was correctly parked in the two marked disabled bays. 'I've seen some outrageous parking over the years but this has beat them all. Motorists who illegally park in spaces that are marked 'disabled badge holders only' can face fines 'When I returned to my shock the white Porsche had squeezed itself between us on the yellow criss-cross, which is for wide disable access to the cars.' 'It was pretty obvious that the bay wasn't for parking and is needed to allow disabled drivers room to get their wheelchairs in and out their cars but this appears to have been lost on the Porsche driver.
