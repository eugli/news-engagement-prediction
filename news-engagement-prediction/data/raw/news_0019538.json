The brain and spine surgery specialist says he has been left with a permanent disability and has suffered anxiety and depression. Ad Feedback \nThe claim says Walker has lost and will continue to lose income as a result of his physical and mental injuries, and that he will face future medical expenses. \nWalker has not submitted to the court how much he will seek in compensation. He is relying on the the Montreal Convention, an international treaty on compensation for airline passengers, and Australia's Civil Aviation Carriers' Liability Act. \nAustrian Airlines did not respond to a request for comment. The airline's Australian lawyers, HWL Ebsworth, declined to comment. Dr Walker and his lawyers were also contacted but declined to comment. - Brisbane Times", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T08:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T04:31:06.260+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
