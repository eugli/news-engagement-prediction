But it worked when it mattered most: On home soil, at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics where Canada was top three in the overall medal tally and won the most gold medals of any nation. And there’s little doubt that Canada has continued to win more medals in subsequent Games than it would have without this program, which focuses funding on athletes with the most potential.\nBut at what cost?\nIncreasingly, questions are being asked about how the millions of taxpayer dollars are being spent in pursuit of Olympic medals and how medal-targeted funding is changing the very nature of sports in Canada. \nWhat has been a growing debate in the sports community will become more public this spring with the federal government’s review of this funding approach, which values medals over participation.\n  “It’s an explosive issue within the sport community when dollars are scarce,” says Bruce Robinson, CEO of Freestyle Canada, which has numerous medal-targeted skiers heading into the 2018 Peyonchang Olympics. “Some sports will lose out, no matter which direction it goes.”\nOwn the Podium (OTP) was created by the organizing committee for the Vancouver Games looking to avoid a repeat of the embarrassing statistic of being the only country to host an Olympics without winning a single gold medal, not once, but twice, Montreal in 1976 and Calgary in 1988. It’s been federal government policy ever since.\nNow, $64 million — a third of the $194 million Ottawa puts into sports annually — goes to funding athletes in the sports indentified as having strong potential to win medals. \nCanada used to spread taxpayer funds around more broadly to all sports and elite athletes but in the OTP era, just getting to the Olympics is no longer considered such an impressive achievement. So much so, that some athletes who qualified for Rio weren’t even put on the team because they weren’t deemed competitive enough to bother taking.\nMany athletes have balked at the idea that the value of Olympic sports comes down to medals alone and say the targeted approach has gone too far and it’s time to widen the funnel for sports funding again. \nAnd, pulling back even further, there’s a broader debate about spending ever-more money in search of medals — $82 million to win 25 medals at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics and $116 million to win 22 medals at the 2016 Rio Summer Games — while youth participation in organized sports is declining and Canada is facing a childhood obesity and inactivity crisis.\nAs the chief executive of OTP, Anne Merklinger hears these kinds of concerns all the time.\n“We can’t be all things to all people,” she says. “If we’re not investing those dollars in a way that helps Canada win more medals then we’re not doing our job.”\nBut the question that has been hanging uncomfortably in the air since the federal government hired consultants last year to review the medal-targeted approach — including any “unintended impacts” it may be having — is whether the Liberals are looking to overhaul OTP or simply tweak it. \nCarla Qualtrough, the Minister for Sport and Persons with Disabilities, expects to have the initial report in her hands by the end of March and implement whatever changes it leads to by June.\n“There are a ton of benefits to a country having results in the medals,” Qualtrough says. “We care about our athletes pursing their dreams and achieving the best they can achieve and we know this is a cycle … our youth are inspired by our athletes and, in the meantime, everyone gets more fit and more active and Canada is proud,” she says.\n“Now, are we super-obsessed with medals? No it’s not the only thing that’s going on in sport in this country.”\nBut the other pieces are struggling: stories of children unable to play sport because of the high cost or the lack of coaches, programs and facilities are all too common. And, for those who do stay in sports, the costs can be astronomical. Alpine skier Dustin Cook and his parents, for example, spent over $100,000 on team fees in the seven years it took him to get good enough to be fully-funded by the national team, right around the time he won Canada’s first-ever world championship super-G medal in 2015. \nA boost in core funding could solve many of the problems national sport bodies grapple with. And Qualtrough, a three-time Paralympic swimming medallist, says she always advocates for a bigger funding pie for sport but she hopes this review will uncover “some efficiencies” in how the existing one is doled out.\nRight now, within national sport federations, medal potential drives decision making, programs for next generation athletes are often cannibalized to provide for today’s elites and an increasing amount of staff time is taken up filling in the paperwork just to get the funding. It takes Freestyle Canada four people working most of a month to deal with the annual OTP reporting demands, Robinson says. \n“That type of bureaucracy is, frankly, unneeded,” he says.\nPatrick Jarvis, executive director of Canada Snowboard and formerly on OTP’s board of directors, agrees with Robinson on the excessive reporting and thinks the system would also benefit from “transparency around the final funding decisions.”\nBut the biggest change they and others hope will come of the review is a move towards more predictable, multi-year funding.\n“There needs to be certainty on the funding side for sports that we’re not going to be cut off at the knees because we have one bad Games, it’s one day, one opportunity that establishes four years of funding,” Robinson says.\nThe world of sports is constantly changing and individual athletes rise and fall so funding targeted to winning medals, by its very nature, should be fluid. But over the years, Sport Canada funding funneled through OTP recommendations has morphed from being a welcome top-up (to hire a specialized coach, or hold an extra training camp) to making up 80 per cent of the high performance budgets for many sports including freestyle skiing, snowboarding, athletics and synchronized swimming.\nA high performance program can be here one day and gone the next with a dramatic change in OTP funding. That’s a lot to have riding on one or two performances with all the variables of weather, judging and human frailty. \nTriathlon’s OTP allocation dropped by over half after the 2012 London Olympics and skeleton’s $875,000 budget dropped down to just $37,000 after the 2014 Sochi Olympics. Now, it’s Synchro Canada trying to figure out how to manage without any of the $750,000 they’ve received in OTP funding, on average, annually to support training and expert support staff.\nCanada’s synchronized swimming team failed to earn a spot for the 2016 Olympics, despite winning their qualifying tournament, and the duet came 7th instead of 3rd, their performance objective, so they’ve “ceased to exist” as far OTP funding is concerned, Jackie Buckingham, chief executive of Synchro Canada, says.\n“We can’t fault OTP for doing what they’re supposed to be doing,” Buckingham says. \n“But, as we move forward, from a sport’s perspective it would be great to come up with a different approach that wasn’t feast or famine. It’s really hard to execute programming when you have all the money you need and then you have no money and it’s not like you can put it away for a rainy day, OTP funding has to be spent on what it was targeted to be spent on and if it didn’t get spent, theoretically, you’re supposed to give it back.”\nA few top echelon sports that have more success with corporate sponsorship, such as figure skating, the sport Buckingham came from, aren’t as dependent on government funding.\n“For most sports, OTP is creating the ability for a high performance program to exist, we simply can’t do it without them,” she says.\nBut the synchro athletes, who have world championships in Budapest this year, are going to try.\n“They’re motivated, they say ‘we’re going to do it, we’re going to show OTP we can make those results happen.’” \nThe athletic drive to succeed despite the odds is a powerful one but it’s arguably a perverse system that offers the most help to those who are already at the top and makes the mountain for those farther down even harder to climb.\nJosh Vander Vies, president of AthletesCAN, an association of national team athletes, is hoping the review addresses that concern and prompts an even broader conversation about Canadian sports culture.\n“Is it really a Canadian value to be winning medals at all costs? What are we going to do about the obesity and physical inactivity crisis in our kids? And what kind of support can we give, as a country, to our highly inspirational national team athletes who aren’t multi-medallists?” he says. “Those are the really hard questions that I hope it can answer.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:14:25.399+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
