Pierre Battah ​\"The decision to close [a business] is essentially taking the decision upon themselves as the employer to say, 'We don't want people travelling,'\" Battah said.\nMonday afternoon, the province issued a strict warning against travel on provincial highways and roads, restricting them to emergency vehicles and essential services personnel.\nKeep digging: Monday's blizzard forces more closures into Tuesday \nEven in less severe situations, when the weather isn't bad enough to warrant widespread warnings and closures, Battah believes most employers are \"fair-minded,\" and their storm day policies trust employees to make a reasonable decision.\n\"Regardless of where you live, if you think your safety is going to be impacted by staying when the weather is turning ... then you need to do what's right for you and make that move,\" he said. \"And I certainly think most employers would want people to make that call.\"\nFor many, however, it really comes down to whether employees will be paid for a storm day, Battah said.\n\"Many employers acknowledge the fact that they are going to pay people for not coming to work a few times a year, and most do.\"\nCare for essential staff  As for health-care workers and others who provide essential services, Battah said employers are used to making extra provisions for getting employees to and from work.\nMany will offer transportation or pay for a nearby hotel.\n'There are unreasonable employers who make unreasonable requests of employees at the best of times, and they do no differently [during] storms.' - Pierre Battah, human resources specialist Cindy Lidster, a nurse at the Dr. Everett Chalmers Regional Hospital in Fredericton, was at work during Monday's blizzard.\n\"If there's any way possible to get in we get in ... we're just hoping our replacements can get in,\" she said.\nAnd there are always arrangements, she said, for essential workers to stay at the hospital if they need to.\n\"If we have to spend the night we've got scrubs, we've got food, there's probably a bed that we can lie down on.\"\nNancy Parker, executive director at the Moncton Hospital, wrote in an email that employees are expected \"to make every reasonable effort to report to work before, during and after inclement weather.\"\n\nMany who came to work Monday were prepared to stay at the hospital until conditions improved, she said.\nParker said areas were set aside for staff to rest or sleep on stretchers, and extra food was made available.\n\n\"We sincerely appreciate our staff's dedication and commitment to go the extra mile for their patients,\" she said.\n\nSome unreasonable bosses Battah acknowledged there are employers and employees who don't use their best judgment, but he believes they are in the minority.\n\"There are unreasonable employers who make unreasonable requests of employees at the best of times, and they do no differently [during] storms,\" he said.\n\"There are employees who quite frankly are looking for every opportunity not to work and storms provide [an excuse] — 'I couldn't get in.'\"\nBattah said the key is to rely on the reasonable judgment of most people in most situations.\n\n\nwith files from Information Morning Moncton", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T20:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T08:24:15.314+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
