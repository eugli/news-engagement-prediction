Eager to catch up with the MCU in regards to scope and ambition, we've seen quite a handful of new installments announced over the past few months. But the next two films in the lineup are Wonder Woman and Justice League , both of which will introduce classic DC characters for the first time in live-action. And while fans have also been hoping for popular Green Lanterns Hal Jordan or John Stewart to show up on the scene, it now appears that another Lantern may be making the first appearance. \nThe Wrap and Heroic Hollywood's Umberto Gonzalez recently did a periscope session, where he revealed some sneak peeks and rumors into the DCEU. Here, he claimed that there would indeed be a Green Lantern in Justice League , although he admitted he had trouble with the character's name. After revealing it wouldn't be fan favorites like Kilowog, fans put the pieces together that Abin Sur would make the most choice. \nAbin Sur is a Green Lantern of significance in DC comics. Because it is he who gives OG Green Lantern Hal Jordan the power ring, and inducts him into the Corps. When mortally wounded by enemy forces, Abin Sur makes an emergency landing on Earth, where the power ring choses Hal Jordan as its new owner. \nConsidering Abin Sur's role in DC mythos, it would make perfect sense for him to a make a cameo in Justice League . The upcoming film is already introducing a ton of other important characters and giving a glimpse into their origin stories with The Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg. Seeing Abin Sur on Earth or possibly giving his ring over to Hal Jordan would give us a tease for the Green Lantern Corps movie, while also pleasing die hard fans who felt like a Lantern should have been included in the film's original team. \nNow the only question is how Abin Sur would logically be introduced during the events of Justice League . Luckily for us, Earth is likely facing an apocalyptic event when Steppenwolf arrives to procure the Mother Boxes from Earth. The Green Lanterns are essentially space police officers, with Abin Sur being the protector of Earth. Perhaps he will journey to Earth in an attempt to help the Justice League , only to be killed and eventually will his ring to a new Lantern. \nOf course, this is just a rumor at this point. While Umberto Gonzalez certainly seems to have some insider's info into the DCEU, we should probably take this with a grain of salt until it is confirmed. That being said, I don't think many DC fans would be disappointed to see a Green Lantern inclusion in Justice League . \nJustice League will fly into theaters on November 17, 2017.
