SpaceX said fitness tests were likely to take place later this year (Picture: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images) \nSpaceX also took the opportunity to thank NASA, without whom it said the trip would not be possible. \nThe mission will take place in a crewed Dragon spacecraft, for which most of the funding had been provided by NASA’s Commercial Crew program. \nIt said the launch would also make use of the Falcon Heavy rocket, which was developed with internal SpaceX funding. \nLater this year, the company will launch its Crew Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station without a crew. \nA crewed mission is then expected to take place in the second quarter of 2018.
