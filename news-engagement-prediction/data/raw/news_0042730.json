The family dog started digging and managed to reach Steve Bayers' jacket, but couldn't pull him out.\nThe next door neighbour heard the commotion and ran over with a shovel.\n“We knew they were under the snow.  You've only got a certain amount of time,” said neighbour Peter Mansfield. “It was only small, but that snow is heavy. So we just kept shoveling until we got them out.\"\nIt took nearly ten minutes to free everyone.\n\"Hate to overdramatize it as a life or death situation, and it was definitely that,\" said Steve Bayers. \nBayers says the soft issues around his knee are certainly damaged, and that he remains shaken up.\n“That's it for snow forts for us,” he said. “Never want that to happen to anybody.\"\nLast week, the City of Moncton urged parents to keep their kids from tunneling into big snowbanks, especially with all the heavy equipment working to remove them.\nBayers is echoing the statement, and is asking to parents to ensure their children are safe while playing in the snow.\nWith files from CTV Atlantic’s Bruce Frisko. \nPhotos A Lawrencetown man and two children became trapped after a snow fort collapsed on them over the weekend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T02:43:28.766+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
