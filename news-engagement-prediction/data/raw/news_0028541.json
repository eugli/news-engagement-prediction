Now she shares how she reduces their frequency... On the TV show “Grimm,” Claire Coffee’s character is a sorceress whose outer beauty is frequently uglified by her inner darkness. In real life, she’s also occasionally taken over by something unpleasant: painful migraine symptoms. Coffee, 36, openly shares the fact that she suffers from the severe headaches. She even joked on Twitter that her character’s nasty disposition could be caused by migraine pain. “If only Adalind had [an eletriptan],” said @ClaireCoffee in an Oct. 14, 2014, post, referring to a prescription migraine medication. The actress is one of 36 million Americans who suffer from migraines, according to the Migraine Research Foundation, a nonprofit that funds research into the condition. Not only do more women – 27 million – have migraines, they also have them more often than men. Migraine symptoms frequently last longer in women too, the MRF reports. In addition to debilitating pain, migraines symptoms include: Aura (visual disturbances) Sensitivity to sound and light Dizziness Nausea Potential triggers include certain foods – chocolate, for example – or skipping meals, alcohol, bright lights, loud noises, strong odors, caffeine, stress and hormonal changes. For some women, pregnancy makes migraines worse. Not for Coffee. In fact, she found relief from her condition when she was pregnant with her son Calvin. (Coffee and husband musician Chris Thile of the Punch Brothers and Nickel Creek announced the birth of their son in May 2015.) In this exclusive Lifescript interview, Coffee talks about her lifelong journey to manage migraines. When were you first diagnosed with migraines? I’ve experienced migraines since elementary school, around 3rd or 4th grade. As a teenager, they became especially bad, which I attributed to hormones and puberty. [But] I saw a couple of neurologists before I was diagnosed with migraines. [ Editor’s note: Migraines can be harder to diagnose in children because their symptoms may differ from those of adults, according to the National Institutes of Health. Kids can have migraine pain on both sides of their head; adults usually have it only on one side. Sometimes, a child’s only symptom is vomiting.] Did other members of your family have them? My dad has always had migraines too. I know there’s some evidence that migraine headaches run in families. What triggers your migraines? I’ve also found that stress, changes in my sleep patterns, eating too many sweets and going for more than four hours without eating food can all trigger migraines. What have you found helps you to manage your migraines? I take [eletriptan], a prescription medication that blocks migraine headaches in progress. [ Editor’s note: Triptan medications help ease migraine symptoms by acting on chemical receptors and constricting blood vessels in the brain.] I also started doing acupuncture the last several years and have found it really helps a lot. [ Editor’s note: Migraine patients who underwent acupuncture had less intense migraines and fewer episodes per month, according to a 2012 study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.] I used to get 4 to 6 migraines a month, but I’ve learned to manage them pretty well. I typically only get one migraine a month now. Have you tried other natural treatments? I have an herbalist who has blended together a mixture of herbs, such as butterbur, [along with] peppermint oil, that help with my migraines. [ Editor’s note: There’s some evidence that butterbur extract may reduce the frequency of migraines, but not much research has been done, according to the Migraine Trust, a British health and research charity that supports people with migraines. Menthol, the active ingredient of peppermint oil, was effective at helping stop migraine pain and easing nausea when applied to the forehead and temples, according to a 2010 study published in the International Journal of Clinical Practice.] Did being pregnant make your migraines worse? I was really worried about what effect my pregnancy would have on my migraines. I had heard some women say they were more prone to migraines during their pregnancy. But I actually had a reduction in the number of migraine headaches that I experienced. I had a few flare-ups, but chose to manage them naturally through exercise or using a cold compress. See Pregnancy and Migraine Headaches: What Women Need to Know Did you make any dietary changes after you were diagnosed with migraines? I did a food-elimination diet to see if certain foods were triggering my migraines . But after eliminating foods and then adding them back in, I found the only trigger for me was sugar. Eating too much sugar can cause me to have a migraine, and so can low blood sugar caused by skipping meals. I’m a big snacker, so I try to snack on lean proteins and vegetables that keep my [blood] glucose levels steady in between meals. When I’m on set, I might snack on yogurt or nuts, and then have a salad with lean meats such as fish or chicken for lunch. How do you handle the stress of performing? “Grimm” is filmed in Portland, Ore., and I love hiking on the beautiful trails with my husband. Just being outdoors really calms me, and hiking – or even walking – is a great form of exercise. If I’m indoors, I’ve learned that deep breathing is one of the best ways to lower stress in the body. On your blog , Full Disclothesure, you write about health and beauty advice you’ve acquired during your career. What tips can you share? I was lucky in that I had a great pregnancy – with no morning sickness or heartburn. But the one thing I had was a red, blotchy skin rash. My pregnancy hormones had made my skin incredibly sensitive to dryness. Any amount of parched air sent it into a fit of rage, and my [usual] coconut oil regimen just wasn't replenishing the moisture loss. I knew that a lot of active skin care ingredients are off-limits to pregnant women – and I tend to be a natural skin-care junkie. So I began working with my skin-care guru to find products that would prevent moisture loss while also creating a barrier from the elements. While this solution might not work for everyone, I found that rinsing in the morning with an essential cleansing oil, followed by a serum containing hyaluronic acid and vitamin B5 – and a few drops of pure Jojoba oil – really helped. In the evening, I repeated this, but also added a daily moisturizer. For more information and expert advice, visit Lifescript’s Migraine Health Center . How Much Do You Know About Migraine Headaches?
