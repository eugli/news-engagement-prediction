The Monster victory lane girls look like hookers. What's up with that @NASCAR — Tyler Scott (@TylerScott) February 19, 2017 https://t.co/cSYV5uBJBr . Evidently they don't watch the NFL or have seen a Peloton bike commercial! I say WeeHee!! Let's go racin' boys!!! — Larry The Cable Guy (@GitRDoneLarry) February 20, 2017 \nCovington told ESPN the company had not discussed the issue with NASCAR, but he correctly noted that NASCAR race girls have worn even more revealing outfits in the sport's past, as some social media users noted. For the special few who were disturbed by the Victory Lane attire of the Monster Energy girls today, I offer a history lesson. #NothingNew pic.twitter.com/jxhKy4hYOI — Dave Moody (@DGodfatherMoody) February 19, 2017 \nMonster Energy is in its first season as the title sponsor for NASCAR's premier series, in a sponsorship deal reportedly worth about $20 million per year.
