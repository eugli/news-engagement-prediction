THE FINAL STRAW? \nWhile Jericho did a lot to impress Owens, his favours were returned with hostility as Owens would officially turn his back on his now former best friend and attack him live on RAW. \nSUBMIT AN ARTICLE \nGot an opinion on Kevin Owens attacking Chris Jericho?

A cerebral Saboteur \nOne shot of Samoa Joe arriving on RAW showed that he came with a special friend, none other than Triple H - who requested a private conversation with Owens. \nThe two were later seen talking backstage - before Owens would turn his back on Jericho. \nNext week's episode will surely see the Universal Champion go on to explain his actions towards Jericho, but it would be quite a surprise, if Triple H wasn't involved somehow. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
