Jonathan Vance, and the deputy defence minister, John Forster, issued a directive that \"re-emphasized\" the proper handling of documents and data and took additional action to \"prevent unauthorized disclosure of classified information,\" said Suzanne Parker, a spokeswoman for the department.\nChief of Defence Staff, Gen. Jonathan Vance, issued a directive last year 're-emphasizing' the importance of properly handling classified information. (Fred Chartrand/Canadian Press)\nNot only were military and civilian staff at the Department of National Defence subject to the formal notice, but civilian contractors embedded in the department were given a reminder and training.\nBetween 2010 and the end of 2016, the military conducted 11 boards of inquiry into the loss or jeopardizing of secret information, according to figures from the department's administrative investigation support centre.\nAt least six of them involved the navy, and half of those investigations fell within the jurisdiction of the Pacific fleet headquarters in Esquimalt, B.C.\nAnother spokeswoman, Ashley Lemire, said the bulk of the cases took place between 2010 and 2014 and the number of inquiries has started to taper off with no investigations recorded last year.\nNational Defence refused to disclose the nature of each breach and the outcome of the investigation, which were not criminal in nature but still had the potential to lead to disciplinary action against members.\nBoards of inquiry are intended to be an \"internal process to inform the [chief of defence staff] and not a public inquiry,\" said Lemire, who added none of the reports have been sent to outside agencies, such as the RCMP, for further action.\nThe mishandling of secrets could be something as simple as leaving a filing cabinet open — all of the way up to the inadvertent disclosure of data in public.\nPrevious cases Recently, a former top national security adviser told CBC News that leaks of classified information at DND prompted him on a couple of occasions to call in the RCMP.\nRichard Fadden, who served as head of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, deputy minister of defence and national security adviser to two prime ministers, says he never worried top secret information was going out the door.\nFormer top security boss says it's 'almost impossible' to trace defence leaks \nThe focus of his worry involved lower grades of classified records and data.\n\"Over the course of my career, I've either asked for or ordered a number of [RCMP] inquiries to be made when classified information has been leaked,\" Fadden told the CBC News in early February.\n\"It is almost impossible to find who does it.\"\nThe only major incident over the last six years involved the case of former sub-lieutenant Jeffrey Delisle, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2013 after spying for the Russians.\nRichard Fadden is a former deputy minister of defence and national security adviser to the prime minister. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)\nSome of the less serious RCMP investigations that may have taken place at Fadden's behest include police inquiries into how the media got hold of a federal cabinet decision that temporarily halted plans to lease a new military supply ship. That took place in late 2015 and was reported by both CBC News and The Canadian Press.\nThe Mounties also probed a 2014 leak into the former Conservative government's decision to sole-source the $800-million purchase of new Sea Sparrow missiles for the navy's patrol frigates. That 2014 story was reported by Postmedia.\nThere has been speculation that the investigation into Norman is part of a wider-ranging attempt to plug leaks at the Defence Department.\nAlthough, the RCMP and National Defence have refused to formally accuse him of anything, Norman's lawyer said last week he is looking forward to clearing his name through an \"objective investigation.\"\nMarie Henein issued a six-line statement on his behalf Thursday saying it would be a \"profound disservice\" if Norman was to be the casualty of \"bureaucratic crossfire.\"\nRCMP Commissioner silent on vice-admiral's removal 1:59", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T12:41:20.171+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
