He told Fox Business Network that any policy steps the Trump administration takes would likely have a limited impact this year.\nMnuchin told CNBC that he wanted to see tax reform passed before Congress' August recess, a basic timeline that fit many investors' expectations but disappointed those hoping for more rapid reform and fuller details.\n\"It's been one month now since Trump became U.S. president, and we're still waiting to see what he can do, particularly on tax reform,\" said Kaneo Ogino, director at foreign exchange research firm Global-info Co in Tokyo.\n\"In the meantime, no one wants to bid up to buy dollars, and it all depends on U.S. interest rates, which are still soft-ish, so the dollar is still sagging,\" he added.\nThe yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries fell to a two-week low of 2.372 percent US10YT=RR overnight and was last at 2.375 percent, below Thursday's U.S. close of 2.388 percent.\nThe euro was off this week's lows but remained pressured by fears about anti-European Union rhetoric from French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen ahead of the first round of French elections on April 23, with the second round to come in May.\nThe euro was on track to shed 0.2 percent for the week against its U.S. counterpart, but was steady on the day at $1.0582 EUR= , well off this week's trough of $1.0494 hit on Wednesday, which was its lowest since Jan. 11.\nThe euro's struggle gave sterling a tailwind. The pound stood at $1.2550 GBP= , up 1.1 percent for the week.\n\"We would not be surprised to see GBP/USD retrace to 1.25 but breakouts after long periods of consolidation tend to have continuation,\" wrote Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management.\nThe dollar index, which tracks the U.S. unit against a basket of six major peers, edged down 0.1 percent to 100.970 .DXY, nearly flat for the week.\n(Reporting by Tokyo markets team; Editing by Richard Pullin and Jacqueline Wong)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T08:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T07:45:27.929+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
