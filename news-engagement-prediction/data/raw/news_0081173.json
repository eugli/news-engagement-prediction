And while the fight itself lacked some of the dramatic flair, sheer athletic performances, or stellar camera work (and titties) of some I’ve posted so far this year. \nBut one thing it has going for it is the man behind the camera. This guy’s running all over filming every broken down part of fight shouting about how he’s “tryna be a good cameraman,” motivating the dude to protect his house, telling the brother to jump in and throw some more heat, I’m not even sure if he knew these people or just knew that he was needed in their lives like Bagger Vance but either way there’s no denying his role here. The cameraman is just waiting for a fight to live up to the hype he’s putting out there, one can only hope there’s a next time for him with some dudes with way more enthusiastic fists. \nAnd even better now we know wheat the voice of those old Under Armour “Will you protect this house?” ads is up to these days: \nI’d like to imagine a world this Under Armour guy, Terry Tate: Office Linebacker, and the reanimated corpse of Spuds McKenzie all have their own new lanes in filming viral fight videos. It’d be a great second career for beloved advertising mascots. Jared from Subway can even do the prison edition or the Kids Say The Darnedest things version. ……I’ve had worse ideas is all I’m sayin.
