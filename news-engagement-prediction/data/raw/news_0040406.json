Notices came in September and the residents were set to oppose the fees Monday evening.\n'We were shocked': 11 property owners may have to pay $1.6M in improvement fees Bus fare, water rates and property taxes: Winnipeg's price hikes in 2017 Devi Sharma, the city councillor who represents Old Kildonan, says she is very pleased the developer decided not to pursue the fees. (CBC)\nA city bylaw allows developers to apply to recover costs of local improvements such as building roads, sewers and sidewalks by seeking a cost-sharing arrangement with residents who would benefit from them.\nOn Monday, Devi Sharma, the city councillor who represents Old Kildonan, told CBC News that Genstar had withdrawn its application for the local improvement fee from a scheduled community committee meeting. The developer decided not to go ahead with the request for a local cost-sharing agreement.\n\"I am extremely pleased that the developer Genstar decided to withdraw for the ask for the local improvement bylaw,\" Sharma said just prior to the meeting.\nSharma said that the city will only collect money for the developer if residents on the south side subdivide their own land at a later date.\nThe city councillor called that a \"much better plan\" that would protect residents wishing to stay on their current property in its current form.\nIn an emailed statement to CBC Genstar said rules and procedures were followed, but the company decided to pursue other recovery methods \"which include recouping attributable improvement costs at the time of future development, should it occur, from these and other benefiting lands.\"\nCherry Karpyshin and another resident hug after learning that that Genstar had withdrawn its application for the local improvement fee from a scheduled community meeting on Monday. (CBC)\nThe room erupted in applause at the community meeting when the announcement was made.\n\"We were elated. I can't tell you, the phone was ringing down the street. We were so excited to hear the great news,\" Karpyshin said. \"It was overwhelming.\"\nWhile the fees could come back if the land is subdivided, Karpyshin said the pause means she and her neighbours have time to think about long-term plans for their property.\n\"We understand that but then, like Genstar, we could sell our lots and we could generate revenue to pay for those improvements. This time we had no way of generating income,\" she said.\n\"We are prepared for that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T23:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:00:59.176+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
