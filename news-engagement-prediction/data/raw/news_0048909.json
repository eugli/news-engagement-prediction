And while many of them aren't in use, they appear to have been bought as ways of stifling criticism – with Mr Trump laying claim to websites like TrumpFraud.org, DonaldTrumpSucks.com and NoMoreTrump.org.\nMany of those websites were bought years before Mr Trump even announced his presidential run, with his team snapping up VoteAgainstTrump.com and TrumpMustGo.com in 2012. Years later it bought others like MakeAmericaGreatAgain.vote, just months before he launched his bid for the White House, according to an investigation by CNN.\nThe controversial orders Donald Trump has already issued 10 show all The controversial orders Donald Trump has already issued 1/10 Trump and abortion Protesters flood Independence Avenue during the Women's March\nGetty\n2/10 Trump and abortion US President Donald Trump signs an executive order as Chief of Staff Reince Priebus looks on in the Oval Office of the White House\nGetty Images\n3/10 Trump and 'Obamacare' Nancy Pelosi who is the minority leader of the House of Representatives speaks beside House Democrats at an event to protect the Affordable Care Act in Los Angeles, California.

Mr Trump's company owns 98percentApproval.com, for instance – a reference to his defence against criticism of his ill-fated Trump University, which he claimed was liked by 98 per cent of its students.\nOthers appear calculated to stop people researching to find critical reviews that might harm Mr Trump's businesses. He owns TrumpMultiLevelMarketing.com, TrumpNetworkFraud.com, TrumpNetworkPyramidScheme.com and TrumpNetworkPonziScheme.com, for instance – all bought just before he launched the \"Trump Network\", a much criticised and now defunct marketing scheme, in 2009.\nRead more Michael Moore vows to lead 'resistance' against Donald Trump Yet more make explicit reference to Mr Trump's activities in opposition to those he has criticised in the past. He bought ImBeingSuedByTheDonald.com in 2009, for instance.\nIn all, 3,643 domains are registered to the President's private company, according to CNN's analysis. Only 50 of those domains actually link to a unique website, and another 400 redirect to other pages for Mr Trump's businesses.\nSome of them link out to external websites, like ChicagoTrumpLimo.com, which points at a page where people can buy T-shirts showing they are \"proud to be deplorable\". A similar page redirects to a business that rents out a party bus in Washington DC, where Mr Trump now lives.\nBut Mr Trump's activity in buying up usernames hasn't kept all of them from being protected. His business failed to buy up ImpeachTrump.com, for instance, and that page now acts as a destination for negative news about the President and organising activities for how to protest against him.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:02:35.753+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
