Too bad free porn is still easy to access\".   Playboy was founded by Hugh Hefner in 1953 \nOn Monday, Mr Hefner wrote: \"I'll be the first to admit that the way in which the magazine portrayed nudity was dated. \n\"Nudity was never the problem because nudity isn't a problem,\" added the 25-year-old son of Playboy founder Hugh Hefner. \nIn next month's issue, the magazine will also revive some of its old franchises, including The Playboy Philosophy and Party Jokes. \nHowever, it will drop the subtitle \"Entertainment for Men\" from its covers. \n\"Playboy will always be a lifestyle brand focused on men's interests, but as gender roles continue to evolve in society, so will we,\" Mr Hefner said. \nPlayboy, which was founded in 1953, stopped printing nude photos in March 2016. \nIts US owners said at the time that he internet had made nudity outdated, and pornographic magazines were no longer so commercially viable. \nPlayboy's circulation has dropped from its peak 5.6 million in the 1970s to below 700,000 last year. \nHowever, the magazine's logo showing a rabbit head wearing a bow tie is one of the most recognisable in the world. \nThe company makes most of its money from licensing it around the world to sell products including toiletries, drinks and jewellery.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T05:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:15:38.292+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
