Channel 4 Sarah Beeny travelled round the country looking for the best place \nAnd the winner is … South Ribble in Lancashire. \nSarah looked at several factors, including affordable housing, jobs, business, wellbeing, and culture to transport and family life and compiled a list of the top 50. \nSouth Ribble – where Leyland is the biggest town – scored highly across the board for all the factors, including wages and job opportunities. \nWith average house prices at just over £157,000, owning a home was within reach for most working couples. \nIt also had a high rating for well-being, a friendly community, good schools and accessibility to nearby cities as well as beautiful countryside on the doorstep. Channel 4 50 regions were selected as the best in a survey that looked at house prices, jobs, wellbeing and culture Alamy 5 Picturesque South Ribble topped the TV list of best places in Britain \nSarah said: “I’ve worked in property all my life and I’ve learned that it’s not just about pretty high streets and well decorated interiors. To find the right place to live, what’s essential is planning, planning, planning. Instinct alone is never enough – because often, what we think we know about a place simply isn’t true.” Channel 4 5 One couple travelled to East Dunbarton to compare prices to their London home \nThe programme took four couples – Londoners who can’t afford to buying a flat, graduates were struggling to find a local job, a couple hoping to get on the property ladder and parents of pre-school children who need affordable childcare – and let them sample life in a new place. \nLondon couple Anthony and Charlotte have good jobs but live in London and pay £1050 for rent on a shared house and have no hope of buying. \nBut they considered a move afterThe show took them to East Dunbartonshire in Scotland, the area with the lowest average property prices in the UK at £97,089 – 2.6 times local annual average gross earnings. \nGraduate Kevin, who lives with his parents in Talgarth, South Wales was taken to Cambridge, which has the best ratio of jobseekers to jobs. Channel 4 5 Manchester came 14th on the list \nPersonal trainer Luke and partner Katie, who have a four-month old son Jax, considered a move from Surrey to Yorkshire, where childcare costs are lowest and houses go for £300,000 less than their home town of Epsom. \nThe programme commissioned Dr Alasdair Rae, Senior Lecturer at the University of Sheffield, to pinpoint the best place to live. \nHe said: “South Ribble comes top of the list for a variety of reasons, including its relative proximity to Liverpool and Manchester, its relative affordability, and particularly its wellbeing scores.” \nUK’s Best Place to Live was on Channel 4 tonight.
