The company claimed that the 3rd generation fast charging tech called Super mCharge will be able to charge the phone from zero to full in just 20 minutes. By: FE Online | Published: February 28, 2017 6:43 PM Meizu announced the ‘Super mCharge’ fast charging technology at the ongoing Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. \nNow, with the advent of a new technology, you will not have to wait for long to charge your smartphone before going out. At the Mobile World Congress , Chinese smartphone maker Meizu showcased a new fast charging technology. The company claimed that the 3rd generation fast charging tech called Super mCharge will be able to charge the phone from zero to full in just 20 minutes. The new technology uses Charge Pump Principle in which it applies just2 groups of conversion circuits to directly output half of the voltage. This method reportedly increases the efficiency of the charger from 9 percent to a whopping 98 percent. It also makes sure that the device performance remains stable even while charging. Interestingly, when the Super mCharge tech is used, the battery also does not get too hot which is an added advantage in the days of exploding and overheating batteries. \nThe new quick charge tech has the reduced heat- dissipation and current, and an upgraded data cable capable of supporting 160W. It ensures safety and durability. Meizu, after testing the technology claimed that a 3000mAh ATL battery retains over 80 per cent capacity after over 800 charge and discharge cycles using Super mCharge. According to Meizu, the Super mCharge is ‘much quicker and more reliable than existing available solutions’. Hence, Meizu’s Super mCharge will be much quicker than the popular Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0. The Qualcomm’s charger can reportedly charge a smartphone up to 80 percent in 35 minutes only. Meizu has claimed that the new charging technology can charge a smartphone 11 times faster than Apple iPhone 7 Plus charger and 3.6 times faster than 3.6 times. \nAlso read | ‘Iconic’ Nokia 3310 to come to India in June, priced at around Rs 3,500; Nokia 3, 5, 6 to launch as well; here’s all you need to know \nIn 2016, another Chinese company Oppo had unveiled its own Super VOOC technology which, according to the company can charge a 2,500 mAh battery within 15 minutes.
