And also dinner, thanks to a partnership with a fellow Mount Vernon business. Flavor, which opened in 2015 at 15 E. Centre St., will provide meals, drinks and small plates two hours before every show at Baltimore Center Stage, 700 N. Calvert St. Food service will take place in the theater's second-floor mezzanine dining space as well as on the first floor Sherman Cafe and Bar. Flavor owners Julia and Vanna Belton will provide food service at Baltimore Center Stage… more Baltimore Center Stage Flavor chef and owner Julia Belton and her wife and fellow owner Vanna Belton will oversee the new menu for Baltimore Center Stage, which will incorporate Flavor's American bistro fare but be unique to the theater. The menu will change with the shows, but items for the Feb. 24 preview performance of \"The White Snake\" will include truffle macaroni and cheese, rice bowls and bourbon chicken skewers. Julia Belton is a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America and perviously worked at Eleven Madison Park in New York. “As the owner and chef of a dynamic restaurant in Mount Vernon, it is beyond exciting to be embarking on this new partnership after the rebirth of Baltimore Center Stage,” Julia Belton said in a statement. “Many people do not realize that food is an art form, even simple dishes. As the food service provider for Baltimore Center Stage, I want to ensure that the dining experience is as tantalizing as the shows.\" Flavor will have a warming pantry and walk-in refrigerator to provide the food service, but all the food will come from the restaurant. The mezzanine has seating for 44 people. Only small plates will be served at Sherman Cafe and Bar while the bar side will be managed by the theater in correlation with the brand new Nancy K. Roche Bar on the fourth floor. Renovations to the theater began about a year ago and will combine modern, traditional and contemporary styles with bright open spaces and a new entryway. Baltimore Center Stage added the city's name to its official title earlier this month as a way to embrace its more than five decades in the Baltimore community. The theater first opened in 1963 and was named the state theater of Maryland in 1978. It has since grown to two theaters with the Pearlstone and the Head. The grand reopening will take place March 3 on the public opening night of \"The White Snake.\" Joshua covers hospitality, tourism, casinos and sports business.
