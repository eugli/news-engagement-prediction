Ad Feedback \n\"We want to go out there and enjoy ourselves, but we want to represent the club in a really strong fashion also.\" \nOne of the club's biggest stars, Shaun Johnson is in the Nines squad, but admitted on Wednesday that he's going to have a limited role in the tournament. \n\"We have to manage all of our players,\" McNamara said. \n\"We take this tournament in its own right, but with also one eye on the trials we've got the following two weeks. \n\"So we've got some game time to get through for the whole of our squad over the next few weeks and making sure we get that right is important.\" \nMaking the 44-year-old Ruben Wiki the Warriors' captain this weekend got plenty of headlines, but it's another indicator in the toning down of the importance of the tournament. \nHowever, spectators at Eden Park will be able to see one of the Warriors' all time greats run out for a final time and he can be a great influence for the younger players. \n\"Ruben is an inspirational character around the place anyway, but the opportunity for some of these players to play against the ultimate Warrior, is a great honour for everybody and for ourselves as coaches to be a part of that as well. \n\"Ruben has attacked it in true Ruben style, he's been a part of every training session and is looking in good shape.\" \nAnd unlike the leading NRL players, Wiki is expected to feature heavily over the weekend. \n\"I think he'll play a fair part,\" McNamara said. \n\"He's keen to be fully involved, he doesn't want to have a little cameo role, he's taken it on seriously.\" \nWith there being a fair amount of young players in the Warriors' squad, there is a chance one of them can make a big impression on the coaches and be rewarded with game time during the NRL campaign, as was the case with Solomone Kata two years ago. \n\"Solomone was a great example of that, Nathaniel Roache had a really good tournament last season and came to the light,\" McNamara said. \n\"I remember being at the Roosters, Sio Siua Taukeiaho made his debut for the club at the Nines and played every game throughout that season and went on to play for New Zealand at the end of the year. \n\"So it is a platform and for the young players it's the feel of a really big occasion, you get those butterflies when you're in the hotel before, in the bus coming to the game and when you run out in front of the big crowd. \n\"So seeing the players respond to that, really puts them in a good position moving forward.\" \nWhen asked to pick which of the young Warriors players could make the biggest impression over the weekend, McNamara went for 22-year-old prop Toafofoa Sipley. \n\"There are a lot of players who've shown tremendous talent during preseason,\" he said. \n\"But if I had to pick one, [it would be] Toafofoa Sipley is a big, powerful athlete and has had a really good preseason. \n\"He has changed shape dramatically, from the start of preseason to now and he's a player who potentially could cause a lot of damage for teams in this tournament.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T11:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T06:26:50.078+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
