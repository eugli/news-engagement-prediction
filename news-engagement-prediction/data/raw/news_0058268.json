But there's a lot more that goes on behind the scenes to help Moore's performance than you might realize: At the 19th Costume Designers Guild Awards (presented by Lacoste), Mandy Moore revealed some surprising details about how she gets into character to play Rebecca. \nWhen Moore started filming the This Is Us pilot a year ago, she had to quickly adapt to wearing the \"really epic prosthetic stomach and boobs\" that costume designer Hala Bahmet gave her because Rebecca was pregnant with triplets. But here's the real kicker: Initially, the breasts were made out of bird seed. (?!?) \" Of course ,\" Moore joked. \"But Hala eventually adapted them into the most realistic boobs I've ever seen.\" \nAnd Bahmet didn't stop there: She created multiple pairs that would more accurately reflect the changes a woman's body goes through during a pregnancy. \"There were four different pairs as I progressed through different stages of pregnancy,\" Moore said. \"Hala became the boob guru!\" Facebook PHOTO: NBC \nIt’s not just the prosthetics that make Rebecca Person feel so real, though. \"On our show, [Rebecca] jumps through multiple decades and [Bahmet’s] costumes never distract,” Moore explained. “They always enroll just the right amount of nostalgia helping to create that immediate sense of familiarity that everybody gets when they watch the show.” \nAnd it turns out there's an upside to having a costume designer create everything from scratch. \"Haha created the most meticulously beautiful, flow-y, bohemian maternity dresses [for Rebecca],\" Moore revealed. \"...only to have them completely tossed aside at the last minute because the directors wanted me in a white T-shirt and jeans.\" Still, not all hope is lost. Moore had one last request before she left the stage: \"Hala, I hope you saved them because I’m going to track them down and use them one day in real life!\" \nFor more from last night's show—which included guests like Meryl Streep (recipient of the Distinguished Collaborator Award), Lily Collins (Lacoste Spotlight Award winner), and Jane Fonda —watch our behind-the-scenes Snapchat video, below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:40:52.539+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
