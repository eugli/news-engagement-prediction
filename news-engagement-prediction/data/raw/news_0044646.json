Most of them were probably Bangladeshis. But, today I feel privileged to be in Bangladesh witnessing a historical event (Feb 21). I see people are brimming with emotion to pay respect to their language heroes,” Franca Lina, an Italian national said at the Shaheed Minar. \n“This memorial is a symbol of respect to all language heroes. I feel proud to be able to pay respect to those martyrs,” she said. \n“I wish I could speak Bangla, but alas!\" the Italian said expressing her love for the language after paying tribute at the Shaheed Minar on Tuesday. \nFranca Lina, who prefers to be called ‘Lina’, and her spouse ‘Zoa’ are here in Bangladesh for two months on invitation from an Italian priest who has been living here for quite some time and working on a youth development project. \nDuring her stay, Lina has visited the International Trade Fair in Dhaka and been overwhelmed with the enthusiasm of the people. But, she is more enthusiastic with Amar Ekushey Book Fair. She suggested that there should be a book corner for international publications.\n“We, the Italians, love festivity. But this is something completely different. The day is to show respect to the language martyrs. And I am proud to be part of it,” she told bdnews24.com. \nLina said the priest who invited them to Dhaka has been learning Bangla. “Antolenna’s Bangla is not that good, but he can express what he wants to say in Bangla. With the language he is trying to absorb the creed and culture of the Bengali society,” ‘Lina’ said about the priest. \nAntolenna said: “I come to the Shaheed Minar every year. It’s a different feeling. This year I brought them with me.” \n“I read the history of Language Movement and Independence War. I know how significant this day is for the people of this country.” \n“Bangladesh’s language movement is not comparable with other similar movements. They sacrifice blood for a language. That is one of the reasons the day is universally accepted.” \nSwiss national 'Yana' came to Bangladesh with her husband Md Kamal Sheikh a month ago. \nShe said she heard about the proud history of Language Movement and Independence War from her husband who is from Kapashia in Gazipur but now lives in Geneva. \nShe said Bengalis in Geneva also observed the day with due respect and solemnity and she attended the programme with her husband. \n“But this is completely a different experience. I hope this tradition will continue for ages.” \nShe said she loves the song “Amar Bhaier Rokte Rangano Ekushey February…”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:26:09.787+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
