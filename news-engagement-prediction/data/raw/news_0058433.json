Check out the attached slideshow to see photos of the fun event that honored the Milwaukee area's up-and-coming young professionals. It was one of the largest crowds in the history of the program, which is celebrating its 25th years of recognizing Milwaukee's young professionals. Each guest got a vuvuzela-type horn to help honor the winners and they put them to good use as the rowdy crowd made lots of noise as each winner came to the stage to receive their award. 41 photos More than 700 people packed The Pfister Hotel's ballroom for the Milwaukee Business… more Winners also got a special bottle of 40 Under 40 beer that was brewed by a group of 40 Under 40 alumni in mid-January in the MillerCoors Thirst Lab at Discovery World. Guests packed the seventh floor of The Pfister before the event for a networking reception. Among attendees were many proud parents, co-workers and family members. Several winners brought along their kids to share in the evening. (See below for some of the Twitter postings during the event.) For the second straight year, we inducted four of our past winners into the 40 Under 40 Hall of Fame. They were Greater Milwaukee Committee president Julia Taylor , Milwaukee real estate attorney Bruce Block , Quad/Graphics Inc. chairman Joel Quadracci and acclaimed broadcast journalist Eric Von , who passed away in September 2016. Von's wife, Faithe Colas , accepted the award on his behalf. The crowd gave a standing ovation after a video was played featuring Colas talking about the impact Von had on the community and his advice for young professionals. Watch our website throughout the next week for videos from our 2017 Hall of Fame inductees. Check out the special section on our website by clicking here to read the stories of all our winners and Hall of Fame inductees.
