On Monday, Conway said Trump had “ full confidence ” in National Security Adviser Michael Flynn just hours before his resignation . “I don’t even think she’s saying something that she knows to be untrue,” Scarborough said. “She’s just saying things just to get in front of the TV set and prove her relevance.” “She’s not credible anymore,” Brzezinski interjected. “Behind the scenes, she’s not in these meetings,” Scarborough said, asking why Trump allows her to continue spreading “false information.” \nTrump may have been watching “Morning Joe,” a program that was one of the coziest platforms for him during the Republican primary. Scarborough, who has shifted at times between being supportive and critical of Trump, is known to speak to the president privately as well as offer advice on TV. \nConway may still appear on other MSNBC shows. An MSNBC spokesman said each show makes its own editorial decisions. \nBut the “Morning Joe” team’s criticism follows CNN questioning Conway’s credibility last week after opting not to book her on a program as a substitute for Vice President Mike Pence. \nIn addition to appearing out of the loop when speaking on the president’s behalf, Conway claimed in multiple interviews that there was a “Bowling Green massacre,” a terrorist attack that never happened, to justify Trump’s immigration ban. She also infamously claimed the White House had “alternative facts” to back up its false claims about Trump’s inauguration crowd size. \nConway isn’t the only prominent member of the Trump White House to have raised concerns about credibility this month. Senior adviser Stephen Miller made false claims during a round of Sunday show appearances about voter fraud across the country and specifically in New Hampshire ― baseless theories also promoted by the president. \nOn Tuesday, Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan questioned networks still giving “proven liars” like Conway and Miller “a regular platform” on news programs.
