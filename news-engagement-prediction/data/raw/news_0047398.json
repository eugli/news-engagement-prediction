Everyone expected awkwardness and tension, but this is the All-Star Game, and no matter what went on between them, theyâ€™re teammates for this game, and theyâ€™re in New Orleans to put on a show.

They made one of the most explosive, exciting combos in the NBA for eight years. These All-Star games are the only times weâ€™ll see those moments again, and they provide a reminder of what really was a special team torn apart by Durantâ€™s decision.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T09:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T05:08:14.930+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
