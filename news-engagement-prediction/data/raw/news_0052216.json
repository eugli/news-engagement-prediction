The strongly worded statement came in response to a news report published Wednesday saying China has nearly finished building almost two dozen structures on Subi, Mischief and Fiery Cross reefs -- part of the Spratly Islands chain . According to Reuters, US officials said the structures \"appear designed to house long-range surface-to-air missiles,\" and that building concrete structures on the chain -- where China already has built military-length airstrips -- \"could be considered a military escalation.\" At a press conference Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang denied any wrongdoing, saying his country strove to preserve \"peace and stability\" in the region. He added that China was operating within its territorial rights.

Disputed waters The move comes amid growing tensions between China and the United States as President Donald Trump has shown himself more willing to take a confrontational stance with Beijing than his predecessor. On Saturday, the United States deployed the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson to the disputed waters of the South China Sea as part of maritime \"routine operations.\" JUST WATCHED ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T15:51:40.411+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
