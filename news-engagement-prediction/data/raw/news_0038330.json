(ABC Rural: Daniel Fitzgerald) \nAfter working in CPC stock camps training new staff and helping muster, Mr Shephard was promoted to manger of Humbert River Station. \nBordered on two sides by Gregory National Park, Mr Shephard said he had liked the remoteness of the property. \n\"I liked Humbert River. It was a little place tucked away from everyone,\" he said. \n\"It was really good because I don't mind the peace and quiet. Over the wet [season] the rivers were all up so no-one would humbug you.\" Weather the biggest challenge \nOn becoming a station manager, Mr Shephard said he liked working with other staff, but bookwork took some time to get used to. \n\"It was more the bookwork side of things I had to get my head around more than anything. The staff and livestock weren't a great deal of problem,\" he said. \n\"I don't change staff over that much. In the stock camp I had years where they have come back two or three years in a row, but generally I only turned two or three over in a camp every year, so I was lucky like that. \n\"I think if you can keep people learning new skills â€¦ and you are prepared to work with them, I think it is a lot easier.\" \nMr Shephard said often the biggest challenge he faced while managing stations was the weather. \n\"Someone told me there is only a couple of inches [of rain] between a good and a bad manager,\" he said. \n\"But we are lucky here [at Newry Station] because we have some sort of a wet season every year, so we have time to work with it. \n\"Sometimes lighter wet seasons aren't too bad because the grass is sweeter, but then you can have a good wet season and fires can come through and change your plans again.\" \nMr Shephard said his three children, two of whom were born at Humbert River Station and one at Carlton Hill Station, were lucky to grow up on the land like he did. \n\"I think they are going to miss [Newry Station] more than anyone,\" he said. \n\"[Living on the station] they do grow up in their minds a lot quicker. They know what is going on and know what should be done around the place. \n\"I think some of these first year [ringers] get a bit upset with them, [when they] tell them what to do.\" \nWhile Mr Shephard is moving his family to north Queensland, he will return to do contract work for CPC, helping train new staff. \nManagement of Newry Station has been taken over by Dave Young.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T10:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T15:41:34.176+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
