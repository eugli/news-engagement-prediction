Source: 7 News New hope for chronic pain sufferers relying on medicinal cannabis \nSeven News can reveal a bill to establish a register for them and their carers will go before the state parliament this week meaning they will no longer be forced to break the law if it passes. \nBen Oakley is one sufferer who faces pain all too often. \n\"I'm looking pretty grey, I'm not moving very well,\" he told 7 News on a \"not particularly good\" day. Ben Oakley suffers chronic pain. He uses marijuana to ease the pain, but breaks the law by doing so. Source: 7 News \nBen has \"stiff person\" syndrome, which causes fits of sharp, debilitating pain. \nMedicinal cannabis does help with the chronic pain, but he breaks the law using it â€“ as does his father who buys it. \n\"The restrictions are still way too prohibitive this should be accessible for anyone who needs it,\" Michael Oakley said. \n\"We're talking about a herb. A herb which hasn't been responsible for a single death.\" Family and carers who acquire marijuana for sufferers break the law. Source: 7 News Medicinal marijuana is now legal to grow in Australia \nPolice can exercise compassion for medicinal cannabis users if they have a terminal illness, but that means thousands of epilepsy sufferers and people like Ben are forced to break the law. \nLast month 7 News revealed the frustration with the limited access and slow progress of medical trials, prompting Opposition Leader Luke Foley to take up the fight. \n\"There ought to be the political will here,\" Mr Foley said. \n\"Why on earth should these people who already suffer so much live in fear of the long arm of the law?\" The opposition will introduce the bill for a register to protect chronic pain sufferers and their carers. \nThe opposition will this week bring a bill before parliament with the hope of creating a registry for the ill and their carers. \nThe register would protect suffering users from prosecution and hopefully give them one less thing to worry about. \n\"Let's change the laws,\" Mr Foley said. \"Let's do it straight away. My offer to the premier is let's do it together.\" Only the terminally ill are protected by a compassion clause at this time. Source: 7 News \nThe move has given frustrated campaigners like Lucy Haslam hope who see it as \"long overdue\". \n\"This has been dragging on for a very long time now,\" said the mother who watched her son Dan suffer through bowel cancer until his death \nThe new health minister, Brad Hazzard, said he would work to help the terminally ill.
