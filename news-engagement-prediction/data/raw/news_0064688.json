She writes for FP’s The Cable, a real-time take on the news in Washington and the wider world. She has been at FP since the fall of 2016, before which she was an associate editor at New America, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington. She has a B.A. in Russian literature from Columbia University, an M.Phil. in Russian and East European studies from the University of Oxford, and studied Soviet dissidence in archival centers in Moscow, Tbilisi, and, on a Fulbright, in Bremen — all of which means that at FP, she writes when she can on Russia and Central and Eastern Europe.

Watch The Singing Revolution , the moving (if at times melodramatic) documentary about dissidence (through, among other means, song) in 1980s Estonia. Learn Estonian online for free. (Your author tried this program one summer and found the course excellent, although she did not continue it and now can only remember how to say “hello,” “thank you so much,” and “I don’t speak Estonian.”) Become an e-resident . Estonia was the first country in the world to offer e-residency to “to anyone in the world interested in administering a location-independent business online.” Read Sofi Oksanen , the Finnish-Estonian author whose arresting novels Purge and When the Doves Disappeared both deal with Estonia’s complicated 20th century and the choices made by those who lived through it. Spend two percent of your GDP on defense, per NATO recommendation.
