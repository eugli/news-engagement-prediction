The US star credits Federer as inspiration after the Swiss came back from a lengthy knee injury layoff to win the Australian Open in January -- his 18th grand slam title -- at the age of 35. Read More \"He's still here. I'm going to go say hi, don't tell anyone. I love 'Rog,'\" Vonn, 32, told CNN's Alpine Edge. \"He's the best. He won in Australia and I feel like a lot of people counted him out because he's 'old.' And he won. \"I get so much inspiration from that. He's such a humble person but he has so much heart. He always gives everything he has. I try to emulate that in myself, in my skiing, in my career. JUST WATCHED The steepest start gate in skiing Replay More Videos ...

I think this is the icing on the cake for today. \"I mean, at some point he had to come watch me. It was about time.\" Vonn revealed in January that her broken arm -- suffered during training in Colorado in November -- caused nerve damage so severe she couldn't even move her right hand. The extent of her injury was still apparent Tuesday when a loss of grip on her pole caused her to get distracted and ski out of the super-G. She taped her pole to her hand for Friday's alpine combined, where she came fifth.

More so emotionally than anything else,\" the 2009 world downhill champion and 2010 Olympic champion said. \"Just having no control over a body part is difficult, especially your right hand. \"You don't realize how much you use your right hand until you don't have it anymore. Just the simplest things like eating my food, shaking hands or signing autographs were difficult. \"Getting over that and at least be able to shake people's hand and do stuff like that was a huge step in the right direction, so it's not as good as it could be but it's good enough. \"I'll keep working on it so hopefully I won't have a messed up hand forever.\" JUST WATCHED St. Moritz: glitz and glamor on the slopes Replay More Videos ...

I couldn't be happier,\" Vonn said. \"I had no training and hardly any self-confidence. It was hard to come here and really attack but I did. The bronze honestly feels like gold.

So I made a few phone calls and then my dad called me this morning saying they have tickets. We had the best day.
