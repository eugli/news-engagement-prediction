If you were a star of Taylor Swift’s caliber how do you think you’d protect your music from leaks? Maybe by locking an iPad with one song on it in a briefcase and flying the briefcase and its handler to San Francisco? Good guess! Apparently, this is very much Swift’s way. Ed Sheeran, the flame-headed crooner from across the Atlantic, explained in a recent interview with Brazilian magazine Capricho, “I remember when I did a song with [Swift] for her album, I was in San Francisco, and they sent someone with a locked briefcase with an iPad and one song on it. They flew to San Francisco and played the song I've done with her and asked if I like it. . . . I was like ‘yeah,’ and they took it back. That’s how I hear it.” It’s like regular music sharing, if the file was a diamond necklace loaned to an actress at the Oscars, with security dogging her all night, ready to collect when it’s over. Sheeran is currently spreading the good word about his new album Divide and subsequent 2017 tour. Now is the time to gather as many Sheeran-musing-about-Swift quotes as possible before he is silenced, like this one in British GQ ’s February issue , for example: “There’s an underdog element to it. Taylor [Swift] was never the popular kid in school. I was never the popular kid in school. Then you get to the point when you become the most popular kid in school—and we both take it a bit too far.” What is too far? “She wants to be the biggest female artist in the world, and I want to be the biggest male artist in the world. It also comes from always being told that you can’t do something and being like, ‘F*** you. I can.’” The same drive seems to be put to protecting her music at all costs.
