(Paul Herman, News24) \nJohannesburg - Traditional leaders should be front and centre at SONA walking hand in hand with President Jacob Zuma to open this year’s parliament, Contralesa provincial chair Chief Mwelo Nonkonyana told News24. \nSpeaking on what they expect from this year's SONA, Chief Nonkonyana said traditional leaders felt side-lined by the government. \n\"Some of us are of the view that even at the opening of Parliament, our kings should be invited and paraded.\" \nLIVE: Pupils showing support for Zuma as more MPs arrive on the red carpet before #SONA2017 \nThe traditional leader said Zuma must address the question of their powers and functionality which are currently not dealt with by the Constitution. \n\"The question of the traditional court bill that must be passed must give traditional leaders powers to be immune from criminal prosecution in their application of their judicial execution. This must be tabled during SONA.\" \nAn earlier draft of the bill was rejected in 2016, following criticism from opposition parties and women’s rights groups, who said it trampled on the rights of women, especially in rural areas, News24 reported. \nREAD: New traditional courts bill 'everyone can live with' \nDeputy Justice Minister John Jeffery said the updated bill had taken time to finalise due to extensive discussions about issues including the rights of women. \nTraditional courts would hear cases which include assault where there is no grievous bodily harm, trespassing, crimen injuria, and even allegations of witchcraft. \nCourts would not mete out fines, but will award compensation of up to R5 000. \nNonkonyana also advised Zuma to fund all houses of traditional leaders to help play key roles in rural development.
