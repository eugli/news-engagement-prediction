Article continues below \nAnd, as the scoreline would suggest, Chelsea just weren't at their best. \nTurf Moor is never an easy place to go, and that certainly showed.

David Luiz was impressive despite seemingly playing with an injury, and N'Golo Kante was his typically unstoppable self. \nThere should perhaps be a little concern over Diego Costa, whose goal drought - if we can call it that - stands at three games. The striker hasn't even had a shot on target for over 190 minutes, and man-of-the-match Michael Keane made sure that wasn't about to change against Burnley. \nYet, Costa escaped the wrath of Chelsea fans on social media. Perhaps it's because he's their top scorer, or maybe it's just that they're delighted to have him back after his spat with Conte in January. \nEither way, it was Nemanja Matic who was being targeted. \nThe Serbia international is in a difficult position at the club - he's vying for the same spot as Cesc Fabregas, which means he's always going to be under heavy scrutiny. Matic made a big mistake \nThe 28-year-old is also playing alongside Kante, so it's difficult for him to shine at the expense of his brilliant midfield partner. \nAll the Chelsea fans were asking for, though, were a few decent tackles and maybe one or two key passes going forward. They didn't get them, and here's how they vented their frustration: \nConte may well come under pressure to pick Fabregas instead next week, but fortunately for Matic, even dropping two points at Burnley isn't likely to have damaged Chelsea's title chances at all. \nShould Fabregas be starting for Chelsea instead of Matic?
