AP FILE PHOTO \nThere is still no confirmation if President Duterte will show up at this year’s commemoration of the 31st anniversary of the Edsa People Power Revolution, where he is supposed to deliver the keynote speech. \nThe Malacañang-led event will be held on Feb. 24, instead of Feb. 25, and inside Camp Aguinaldo, instead of the Edsa People Power Monument, so as not to disrupt traffic, according to Menardo Guevarra, senior deputy executive secretary. \nThis will be the first Edsa commemoration after Mr. Duterte allowed the burial of dictator Ferdinand Marcos at Libingan ng mga Bayani in Taguig City. ADVERTISEMENT \nGuevarra said this year’s event would be “sober, simple, no fanfare,” but this did not mean that it would be any less significant.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:35:26.973+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
