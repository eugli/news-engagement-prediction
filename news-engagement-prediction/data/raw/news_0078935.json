(Photo: Jason Getz, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nPALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. – Rickie Fowler is right. \nIt is, indeed, time for him to close the deal. \nThe young star is once again in position to win following a steady procession of outstanding golf around the Champion Course on a toasty Saturday during the third round of The Honda Classic. Fowler scampered away from the field with a bogey-free, 5-under-par 65 and heads into Sunday’s final round at 13 under and four shots clear of his nearest competitor, Tyrrell Hatton (66). Five players are six shots back, including two-time major champ Martin Kaymer. \nBut this is Fowler’s tournament to lose. And he knows it is. Following his second consecutive 66 on Friday, he said as much by telling the world it was time to close out a tournament. \nFULL LEADERBOARD: The Honda Classic \nHe grew tired of coming up short on three occasions last year after he won the Abu Dhabi Classic. The 2-shot lead with two to play that he blew at the Waste Management Phoenix Open. The 74 he shot in the final round of the Wells Fargo Championship in Charlotte to fall into a share of fourth. The disastrous back-nine 39 in The Barclays that took him from the lead into a tie for seventh. \nFowler said he doesn’t look at those as negatives, but those sure did hurt. And those might start haunting him if he doesn’t head to his nearby house in Jupiter late on Sunday with the championship hardware. \n\"I think Fowler really needs this win,\" NBC analyst Johnny Miller said. \"He knows he’s the best player at the top of that leaderboard. He’s got a chance to be a great player, and right now he's a 'wannabe' a bit in that regard with just three wins. A win tomorrow could set him off to a great year.\" \nThe recent trend is just the latest adversity facing Fowler, who has six professional wins but none in nearly 14 months. \nBack in his younger days – he's 28, by the way – he was criticized for having more flash than substance. That he was unworthy of all his fame because of his lack of victories. Then he was overrated, as one survey of his peers said just two years ago. And lately, that the young guns like Jordan Spieth, Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Hideki Matsuyama and Justin Thomas are leaving Fowler in their dust despite being ranked No. 14 in the world. \nWhile not saying so publicly, he used the criticism as fuel, never more so than in 2015 after the survey came out the week ahead of The Players Championship, the PGA Tour’s flagship event. Fowler went out and won the tournament, coming up with big shots when \"my back was against the wall down the stretch and in the playoff,\" he said. \nMORE GOLF:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T07:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:28:20.811+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
