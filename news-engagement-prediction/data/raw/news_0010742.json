Alcohol, like cocaine, would make people less likely to wait for a condom - but unlike cocaine, it not strongly increase sexual arousal.\nFAQ | Cocaine Watch | Record cocaine haul worth Â£191m seized from yacht by Australian police 00:46", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T21:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T16:47:36.316+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
