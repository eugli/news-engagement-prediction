By Zee Media Bureau | Bollywood Life | Last Updated: Sunday, February 26, 2017 - 22:07 0 Follow @ZeeNews \nNew Delhi: Astronomers and space enthusiasts were waiting for this celestial moment with high anticipation for a long time. \nSky gazers across South America and Africa were treated with a breathtaking annular solar eclipse on Sunday, as the skies plunged into darkness when the moon passed in front of the sun in a spectacular \"ring of fire\" eclipse. \nPeople in Argentina were the first ones to observe the eclipse as it crossed South America shortly after 1200 GMT, on course for Africa and broke out in a huge applause as it took place. \nPeople thronged to watch the celestial spectacle, gazing at the sky through special telescopes, protective glasses or homemade cardboard pinhole devices, as they watched the Sun all but disappear briefly as the Moon crossed its path. \nThe eclipse was to be most visible in a 100-kilometre band across Chile, Argentina, Angola, Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. \nMore than 100 stargazers gathered today morning in the southern city of Sarmiento, the point in Argentina where the eclipse was expected to be most visible. \n\"I have already seen six annular eclipses and each one was different,\" said Josep Masalles Roman, an enthusiast who came all the way from Barcelona in Spain. \n\"This one is going to be very fine and it is possible that we will be able to clearly see Baily's Beads,\" a string of points of light produced as the sun's beams break through peaks on the moon's surface. \nThe spectacle will reach Angola south of the town of Benguela around 1515 GMT, then move to Zambia and DR Congo just before the Sun sets and the light show ends. \nAn annular solar eclipse occurs when the Earth, Moon and Sun line up. \nBut even when perfectly aligned, the Moon is too far from Earth to completely block out the Sun, creating instead the impression of a fiery ring. \nTerry Moseley of the Irish Astronomical Association warned that viewers should not observe the eclipse with the naked eye. \nAccording to the Astronomical Society of Southern Africa (ASSA), the eclipse can be safely observed using a basic pinhole projector. \nPunch a tiny hole in a piece of paper with a sharp pencil, hold it into the Sun, and project the image onto a second sheet. \nThe gaps between tree leaves make for a similar effect on the ground, says the ASSA website, calling this \"the coolest and safest way to watch a solar eclipse\". \n\"As about 90 per cent of the Sun is covered, you'll notice a distinct drop in temperature and brightness, and a change in the quality of the light which is hard to describe,\" Moseley told AFP. \nLocals in the province of Chubut around Sarmiento said they noted changes in the height of the tide and animals acting unusually. \nExperts say that as the day darkens, birds and animals enter a night-time routine, thinking sunset is nigh. \nAt the height of the eclipse the Moon is right in the middle of the Sun, leaving a perfect ring of light around the edge. \nOf course, people across social media platforms recalled their 'ring of fire' experience through stunning photographs.
