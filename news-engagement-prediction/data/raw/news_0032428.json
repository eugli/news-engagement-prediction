The expansive executive order signed by Donald Trump last month allows a significantly broader population of immigrants to be picked up for deportation.\nMedia: Brandpoint A Seattle resident who came to the U.S. illegally as a child may have been the first arrest under President Donald Trump of an immigrant protected by an Obama-era order.\nReuters reported Tuesday afternoon that 23-year-old Daniel Ramirez Medina was arrested last week in his father's Seattle home by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. He had no criminal record, according to the report.\nRamirez had a work permit and protection from deportation under former President Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, established in 2012. Those protected under the program, often called Dreamers, gives them at least temporary rights to work in the U.S. and can help them eventually seek legal status. About 750,000 people in the U.S. are protected under DACA.\nRamirez was being held at the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma as of Tuesday afternoon.\nThe officers had arrived at the home to arrest Ramirez's father, though it was unclear why, according to the Reuters report.\nTrump has promised an end to the DACA program, created by executive order, but has only vaguely indicated that he might allow Dreamers to remain in the U.S. after the program is gone.\nThose who have obtained a work permit through the program have filed personal information with the federal government, including addresses and other information that could be used to find them. Obama had promised to use the information only for issuing the work permits and social security cards.\n\"But now, maybe Trump could use that information to track us down,\" said Dulce Siguenza, who works with the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project and is also protected by DACA, in a recent interview.", "external_links": ["http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-immigration-arrest-exclusiv-idUSKBN15T307", "https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=1x4&iu=/36117602/hnp-beaumontenterprise.com/Video&ciu_szs=300x250,728x90&cust_params=video_player%3Dmediaos&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=xml_vast2&unviewed_position_start=1&url=%5Breferrer_url%5D&description_url=%5Bdescription_url%5D&correlator=%5Btimestamp"], "published": "2017-02-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:43:39.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
