Other models are notable for their transformations, but she has remained consistent over the course of her 43 years in the business. Photos of her smiling, healthy, and happy have been used to sell everything from cosmetics to rosé, and the star, who turns 63 today, remains a symbol of all-American sexiness. The images she helped to create—dancing through the streets in the music video for “Uptown Girl,” blowing kisses in Helmut Newton’s Chanel ads, and posing in barely there bikinis for Sports Illustrated —have become classics. In editorials, Brinkley put her allure and athleticism to good use, modeling for photographers such as Chris von Wangenheim, Arthur Elgort, and Patrick Demarchelier; she hiked and played tennis in these images almost as often as she wore runway looks. Her famous physique was often the focal point of many images, too, and that brought a provocative sensuality to her work in the late ’70s and ’80s. Though she’s still blonde and beaming, Brinkley has evolved with the industry. These days you’re likely to find the legend doing many of the things that her millennial peers have mastered. Posting Instagram selfies and using social media to draw attention to her favorite charities, she could teach a course on staying relevant in the digital age. Even without her appealing updates, she stands out as one of the defining American supermodels. On her birthday, take a look back at her very best in the pages of Vogue .
