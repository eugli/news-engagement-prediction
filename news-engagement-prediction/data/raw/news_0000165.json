He plans to return to television with a new chat program in the fall, under the guidance of a different production company.\nProfessor Griff disses Kanye West and Steve Harvey \nTelevision isn’t the only arena where Harvey will need to navigate changes in the months ahead.\nThe 60-year-old broadcaster’s radio show will soon leave Chicago for L.A. — a move that came at Harvey’s request, we’re told. The transition will happen amidst an active campaign from competitor Tom Joyner, who has urged listeners who are “angry with Steve, come on back home to me!”\nJudy Smith is one of the nation's top crisis managers and she's also the basis for the ABC TV drama \"Scandal.\" (The Washington Post/The Washington Post/Getty Images) While being associated with President Trump has proven unpopular for some black performers , including singers Chrisette Michele and Kanye West , one prominent radio insider says that Harvey’s radio career won’t necessarily be damaged by his ties to The Donald.\n“It’s a mistake to assume that all African-Americans have the same political point of view,” says industry vet Michael Harrison, whose 27-year-old Talkers magazine is often called “the Bible of broadcast radio news.” “Some of the most successful African-Americans on talk radio have done so by appealing to the conservative audience ,” he said.\nAngelina Jolie reportedly working with real-life 'Scandal' fixer \nHarrison says it’s too early to measure post-inauguration radio ratings, but when all is said and done, Harvey will be fine unless the networks become convinced that he can no longer sell advertising.\n“I don’t think anyone is panicking,” Harrison said, adding that “I don’t think that this will necessarily hurt him.”\nReps for Premiere Networks, which syndicates Harvey’s radio program, declined to comment, as did reps for Harvey’s TV show. Multiple emails to Smith went unanswered.\nWith Flo Anthony , Brian Niemietz \nTags: steve harvey scandal  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:45:55.093+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
