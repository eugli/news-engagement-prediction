The excited and responsive crowds in the province, Cuddy said, show the quality of the people.\n\"People from away always say, when you start a conversation with a Newfoundlander, it's as if you are continuing a conversation, not starting a conversation. That level of friendliness is also quite unique, the whole experience is great,\" he said.\nSt. John's artist Jud Haynes designed the cover of Blue Rodeo's album 1000 Arms with a photo of Fogo Island. (Blue Rodeo)\nCuddy said Wednesday's performance will be a more theatrical show than previous trips to St. John's, with a mix of old favourites and new songs.\n\"This is the one time we're really bringing all our gear out to the Rock … often we just have it shipped in for the day,\" he said.\n\"As with all our concerts, we try to give people a lot of what they want and expect and some stuff they don't expect. There'll be songs that'll be reworked, there's a big acoustic part in the middle that we have really great players, and it kind of goes scene by scene.\"\nTravel a challenge Getting to and from the island can be a challenge, however, and after coming to Newfoundland in the winter a number of times, Cuddy said the band and crew have learned to plan ahead and make the best of their time.\n'Nobody ever comes to the Rock on the day of the show — too risky.' - Jim Cuddy \"Nobody ever comes to the Rock on the day of the show — too risky. We do allow at least a day on either side of the concert, if not two,\" he said.\n\"We've had guys stuck on the ferry for 12 hours. I was there during the Junos when people were stuck there for three or four days, which is never a hardship, I was actually a little disappointed my flight got out.\"\nBlue Rodeo's latest album 1000 Arms also has a visual connection to Newfoundland and Labrador, as it features a photo of the Fogo Island Inn and was designed by St. John's graphic artist Jud Haynes.\nAs for his extra time in St. John's while on tour, Cuddy said he plans to spend some time visiting and \"wandering around\" the city.\n\"I have lots of friends there, dinners to go to, hockey to play, so I like to get out there for a few days,\" he said.\nWith files from Weekend AM", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T10:33:06.151+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
