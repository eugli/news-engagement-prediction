Why not find out! \nIf there's throbbing bass and a herbal-ish plume coming from your dog's kennel, be afraid: it's not \"just a phase\". A new study from the University of Glasgow and the Scottish animal welfare charity SPCA has found that dogs \"prefer reggae and soft rock\" to other music genres. Cat people, you can start laughing hysterically now. The study set out to explore the effect different genres of music had on a dog's behaviour, testing various playlists that also included Motown, pop and classical music.

Owners, time to make lil' Rover a smooth playlist heavy on the Bob Marley, REO Speedwagon and Ed Sheeran and blast it. \nWhile perhaps the oddest, it's not the first study to explore the relationship between pets and tunes. \nA 2015 study by researchers at the University of Wisconsin found that cats similarly respond to music. \nThe study led to an album of \"classical music for cats\", composed by America's National Symphony Orchestra cellist David Teie, that climbed to number one on the iTunes Classical Music Chart last October.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T12:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T07:44:52.978+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
