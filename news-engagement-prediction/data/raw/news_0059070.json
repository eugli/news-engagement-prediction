Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nWayne Rooney is open to moving to the Chinese Super League after being told he is free to leave Manchester United by Jose Mourinho. \nM.E.N. Sport understands United would prefer to wait until the summer to sell Rooney, 31, even though the club captain is open to leaving before the CSL transfer window closes on February 28. United have identified Antoine Griezmann as Rooney's replacement and it remains probable the No.10 will see out his 13th campaign at Old Trafford. \nRooney previously had a preference to join a Major League Soccer (MLS) club but it is understood he does not expect a Stateside move to materialise while he is still under contract at United. Rooney's deal expires in June 2019. \nUnited received an offer from Shanghai SIPG for Rooney last year but his camp had no interest in negotiating a possible move while he trailed Sir Bobby Charlton's goalscoring record. \nBeijing Guoan were considering a £20million offer for Rooney last month and Shenzhen, who play in the second-tier China League One and are managed by Sven-Goran Eriksson, are also interested.

Rooney trained on Tuesday \n\"You have to ask him,\" he said. \"Of course I can’t guarantee. I cannot guarantee that I’m here next week, how can I guarantee that a player is here next season? \n\"What I can guarantee is that if one day Wayne leaves the club it is not because I want him to leave the club. I would never push a legend of this club to another destiny. \n\"You have to ask him if he sees himself staying in the club for the rest of his career or sees himself moving. It is not a question for me because I am happy to have him.
