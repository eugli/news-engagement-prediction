Tom Sinclair.\nInvestigators continued to use an OPP helicopter, snowmobiles and K9 units in their search.\n“We don't stop until we exhausted all those leads and all the information that sends us into areas that need to be checked and need to be confirmed.\"\nThompson, who has dementia, was reported missing Friday morning from her Laidlaw Drive home in Barrie. The search is now taking place more than 10 kilometres from where it started.\nPolice are appealing to anyone who lives in Oro-Medonte to check their properties for Thompson.
