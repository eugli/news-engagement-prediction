Local Awami League's Organising Secretary Sazedul Islam said brickbats were hurled at Afroza Bari's car from a procession of the Bangladesh Chhatra League's (BCL) local unit. He said that the Mercedes-Benz SUV was attacked around 10am when it reached near the local Bangladesh Agriculture Development Corporation (BADC) office shattering its rear windshield. \"The MP's sister, however, was not in the car. Her son-in-law and grandchild were in the car, but came through unscathed,\" Islam told bdnews24.com. On the evening of Dec 31, unidentified assailants shot the ruling party MP from Gaibandha-1 (Sundarganj) constituency at his home several times. He died an hour later at a hospital in Rangpur. The by-polls for the vacated parliamentary seat have been scheduled for Mar 22. Officials are set to scrutinise the nominations filed for the election on Feb 23 while the deadline to pull out from the race ends on Mar 1. Awami League leader Islam claimed of a feud between Liton's sister and his wife Syeda Khurshid Jahan over securing the party's ticket. \"Jahan believes that if Afroza (Bari) had not sought nomination, she would have got it. That's why the Chhatra League (BCL) activists, who are followers of Jahan, attacked the car,\" he said. A local BCL leader said they were not aware of the incident. \"I do not know anything about the attack on a car. Moreover, I was not in Sundarganj that time,\" said BCL Upazila unit's Convener Samiul Islam Samu. He hung up the phone, when asked whether any BCL activists might be behind the incident. \nAfroza Bari could not be reached for a comment despite several attempts to contact her. He sister Tahmida Bulbul said she has heard of the incident. \"I am now in our village home (MP Liton's house) and Afroza is now at Sundarganj town. A decision on reporting the matter to police will be taken after she returns. Police said they were investigating the matter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:45:19.110+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
