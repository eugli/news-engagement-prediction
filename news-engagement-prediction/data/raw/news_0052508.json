He rewrites his own monologues and extensively researches guests. But when his contract expires in the fall of 2019, Kimmel has thought about retiring from the perch that turned him into a household name. \n“I know I will do the show for another three years,” Kimmel said in this week’s Variety cover story , as he gears up to host the Oscars on Sunday. “It’s possible that will be it. My wife’s pregnant. At a certain point, I’d like to have a little more free time. I have very little free time as it is.” Related Jimmy Kimmel on Hosting the Oscars, Donald Trump Jokes and If Hillary Clinton Will Show Up \nAs the executive producer — and “control freak”— of “ Jimmy Kimmel Live !,” Kimmel arrives in his Hollywood studios at 9 a.m., shoots at around 5 p.m., and returns to his computer after dinner. “I think this job is a grind, and best-cast scenario, a marathon,” Kimmel said. “I want to go out on my own terms. If I ever feel like we’re repeating ourselves, I think it’s a good indication that it’s time.” \nHe added, “I will miss it when I go. Television is changing quickly. I get a lot of offers to do a lot of different things.” \nKimmel, 49, said that when he leaves “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” it won’t be for another late-night vehicle. “If there’s something that excites me creatively, it doesn’t necessarily mean something in show business,” Kimmel said. “I like to draw. I like to make sculptures. I’d like to write a book at some point. Doing the show every day doesn’t leave a lot of time for that.” \nThe late-night landscape has dramatically changed since Kimmel started, with Jimmy Fallon and Stephen Colbert duking it out in the ratings race . Kimmel will occasionally tune in to the competition. “When I do watch, it’s for pleasure,” he said. “Let’s see what Stephen Colbert is doing; let’s see what Fallon is doing. I’ll do that once every few months — not often.” Filed Under: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:35:15.096+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
