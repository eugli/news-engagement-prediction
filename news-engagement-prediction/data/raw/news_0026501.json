That's the idea behind Nike's new initiative, a film titled \"Equality,\" that is set to premiere during the Grammys tonight and again next week during the NBA All-Star Game. The goal of the film is to inspire us to take the values of sportsmanship to our everyday lives. \nThe film stars some of the world's most famous athletes, including Serena Williams, Kevin Durant, and LeBron James. It is narrated by actor Michael B. Jordan and features music from Alicia Keys . Over footage of athletes in a city, Jordan's voice can be heard saying, \"Opportunity should not discriminate. The ball should bounce the same for everyone. Worth should outshine color. If we can be equals here, we can be equals everywhere.\" \nThe film ends with the words \"Equality has no boundaries.\" Nike has led by example by partnering with PeacePlayers and MENTOR:The National Mentoring Partnership .
