The project is known as Redad Alertas (Raid Alerts). Mireles began developing the app during the Obama administration, which saw increased immigration enforcement. He has accelerated development since the election of Donald Trump. Many cities have recently seen an uptick in immigration raids, and the Trump administration announced today that they are taking the first steps necessary to fulfill Trump’s campaign promise to build a border wall with Mexico. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. When finished, the app is intended to collate multiple reports of raids to provide verification, which Mireles says is necessary to defend against online trolls. Once a raid is verified, the system would send alerts via text message to users in a 10 to 20 mile radius. The app, which has attracted support from social justice activists, is projected to launch in about three months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T06:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:39:01.780+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
