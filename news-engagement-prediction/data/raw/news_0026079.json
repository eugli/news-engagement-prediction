Olivo said he’s always had that enthusiasm and hopes the way he coaches will rub off on his players.\nOlivo, 40, said he’s ready to excel with the Broncos as a first-time coordinator. Broncos head coach Vance Joseph grilled him during a six-hour interview to determine if he was the right fit to end an exhaustive search to find the right special teams coordinator.\nThe key, Olivo says, is to focus on how players learn rather than how coaches teach. He has a favorite acronym: “K.I.L.L. it.” It’s startling at first, but fits perfectly with his high-energy approach and projected coaching style. It stands for “Keep It Likeable and Learnable.”\nRelated Articles February 7, 2017 Jhabvala vs. Kiz: What’s the No. 1 thing Broncos must do to close gap with Patriots?

We’re going to turn our guys loose.”\nOlivo has three years of NFL coaching experience working under Kansas City Chiefs special teams coach Dave Toub, who interviewed for the Broncos head coaching job last month. He hopes to transform the Broncos special teams in a similar manner that Toub did in Kansas City.\n“There’s a big difference between teaching and learning and Dave Toub gets that,” Olivo said. “That’s what we’re going to implement here.”\nOlivo, who also has an additional six years of coaching experience in Italy, the United Football League and Coastal Carolina, said he, Joseph and director of analytics Mitch Tanney will work on game and clock management before the season to ensure they’re all working on one accord.\nLate addition. Denver retained seven of its 15 offensive and defensive coaches in addition to keeping the strength and conditioning staff led by Luke Richesson.\n“Luke is one of the best in the business,” Joseph said. “This team has been healthy in the last two or three years. It’s Luke’s program.”\nThey made one addition Tuesday, hiring Cedric Smith as an assistant strength and conditioning coach.\nPhilip Rauscher, a former Broncos coaching intern, will be an assistant to the head coach.
