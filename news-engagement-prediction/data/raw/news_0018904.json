Vision courtesy ABC News 24 . \nAntonio Bagnato, is 28, and has been sentenced to death by lethal injection in Thailand for the murder of another Australian, Wayne Schneider. \nAfter the tragic deaths of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran in Indonesia, many Australians said \"never again\".

Importantly, they came to the conclusion that murder is murder, barbaric and cruel, no matter whether it is ordered by a court or at the hands of a hitman. \nThe Bagnato case will ask us to put our money where our mouth is. Because, by all accounts, Bagnato is not a good guy. In fact, he's up there with what we might imagine is the worst of the worst. Advertisement \nEvidence from the crime scene indicated his victim had been tortured . When Schneider's body was found in a shallow grave, his neck had been broken. \nBut this is exactly why Australia should fight to ensure Bagnato is not given the death penalty. SHARE Wayne Schneider's body was found in a two-metre-deep grave in roadside bushes near a Chinese temple.

The fallibility of courts means it regularly leads to the killing of the innocent, and it doesn't work to reduce murder rates. (It's worth noting that the trial of Bagnato's co-accused was marred by allegations of translation issues and confusion.) SHARE Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran were executed in Indonesia last year. Photo: Anta Kesuma \nBut even if these practical reasons were not compelling, we should still oppose it. \nThe death penalty is not clean. It's not \"killing\" as opposed to \"murder\" because it is done via bureaucracy. It's slow – sometimes lasting more an hour – it's messy, and it's premeditated. SHARE Wayne Rodney Schneider.

Lethal injections are one of the forms of capital punishment most likely to have their delivery botched . \nWe must fight to stop this kind of barbarism wherever it occurs – fight for a society that refuses to put a price on human life, that does not condone retribution and violence. \nBagnato's victim was a former Hells Angels bikie who was allegedly being investigated along with Bagnato for another murder in Australia, as well as international drug deals. Yet few would argue that Bagnato was justified in killing him. \nThe murder was a terrible act and it will be a terrible act if the Thai government murders him. When we justify taking the life of another, we turn ourselves into murderers, too. \nThese men were raised in Australia. Their crimes, and their lives, are our responsibility. \nThe arguments in favour of standing by and doing nothing when other countries impose the death penalty are bunkum . We can't pick and choose which foreign laws to be moral relativists about (as I've previously argued , we would never stand by and condone women being stoned to death for adultery because \"that's the law\"), just as we shouldn't pick and choose which lives we fight for. \nIn fact, legal experts believe this case could be the perfect opportunity for Australia to use its friendly relationship with Thailand to begin to implement the recommendations of a recent parliamentary inquiry into the death penalty. \nThere should be no place for state-imposed murder in Thailand, a deeply Buddhist nation, just as there is no place for it in Australia. \nAs the chair of the inquiry, former Liberal MP Philip Ruddock, wrote: \n\"Not only does an eye for an eye leave the world blind, but the deliberate destruction of human life as a response to crime is an affront to the 'right to life', enshrined under international human rights law. We must continue to campaign in a strong and consistent manner to rid the world of this cruel practice for all time\". \nSince the death penalty decision on Tuesday, there has been relative silence from the government and advocates on this case – something Foreign Minister Julie Bishop must urgently address. Otherwise this case risks bending our moral consistency so far it breaks it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T08:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T03:32:37.361+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
