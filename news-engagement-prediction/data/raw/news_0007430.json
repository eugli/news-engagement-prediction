Supertasters have more fungiform papillae - which carry our 'taste buds' - on their tongue, and typically will not like foods with strong flavours, such as bitter green vegetables, blue cheese and grapefruit. However, parents of those children need not give up, as the study found they just take longer to become accustomed to food they do not like. The study concluded that nearly all children can be trained to eat a particular food. they won't necessarily say they 'like' it afterwards, but they will be prepared to eat it if placed on their plate. Previous research suggests that around 25 per cent of the population are supertasters and have a sensitivity to strong flavours. The trick is simply to make children eat the food they don't like every day for 15 days. After this almost all children will eat their greens without any complaint As part of the BBC's Terrific Scientific campaign, and in partnership with Coventry University, around 80 schoolchildren aged nine to 11 were asked to eat kale At the opposite end of the scale, around 25 per cent of people are non-tasters. They are more likely to try most food, but they might need more salt, spice and condiments than others to prevent food from tasting bland. The remaining 50 per cent are in a category known as tasters, and will often be adventurous in trying new food but will probably have a few items they dislike There are, however, other factors that can affect these proportions. Gender and ethnicity have been shown to affect tasting ability, with females and those with a South American background more likely to be supertasters. But the question of whether we like a flavour is not just down to our 'taste buds' on our tongue, as there are also many brain processes at work. Learning to like the flavour of a food is due to a mixture of its taste, smell, and our brain learning that the food is safe or appropriate to eat. Jackie Blissett, professor in health behaviour and change at Coventry University, said: 'It's been wonderful to work with these young scientists, and they've helped shed some light on one of the great mysteries: why some of us might not like our Brussels sprouts! 'BBC Learning's Terrific Scientific campaign is a fantastic way to engage youngsters in an interactive experiment which makes the learning experiment much more fun.'
