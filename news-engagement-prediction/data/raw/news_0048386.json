But in a new interview, Jennifer - who played Frances Houseman aka Baby - has revealed that the effortless stunt almost didn't happen due to Patrick's knee injury. Speaking about the outdoor lake scene, the 56-year-old actress told Sunday People : \"I remember swimming in the lake was very, very, very cold. You have to be really young and hungry to get in water that cold for that long.\" \n\"It was not good,\" she added. \"It just didn't feel healthy to be in that water.\" The stars later performed the same lift in the film's finale routine to hit song, Time Of My Life . Both Jennifer and Patrick immediately shot to fame together in the 1987 film and remained good friends. However, Patrick passed away aged 57 in 2009 after a long struggle with pancreatic cancer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T16:25:52.919+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
