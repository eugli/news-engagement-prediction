All Stories \nJust in time for Valentine's Day, Willie Nelson gets romantic with \"A Woman's Love,\" a moody, minor-key ballad about the mysteries of the heart. Premiering today on Rolling Stone Country, the song is the first release from Nelson's upcoming album, God's Problem Child , which makes its debut April 28th.

Although written by Mike Reid, who penned Ronnie Milsap's Grammy-winning \"Stranger in My House,\" and Nashville native Sam Hunter, \"A Woman's Love\" swoons like a Nelson classic, full of honking harmonica from longtime bandmate Mickey Raphael and punctuated with a Spanish-influenced guitar solo. The music video is just as evocative, its footage shot in a combination of stark black-and-white and vibrant color. Throughout the clip, Nelson sings the song in front of a full-length mirror, as though as he's giving relationship advice to his own reflection. \nThe country icon, who'll turn 84 one day after the release of God's Problem Child , contributes seven originals to the album, all of them co-written with producer Buddy Cannon. Nelson's touring schedule kept him on the road for more than 100 days last year, so the two worked together via text message, sending ideas back and forth until proper songs emerged. Nelson's first album of all-new material since 2014, God's Problem Child also features one of the final appearances by the late Leon Russell, who swaps vocals with Nelson – as well as songwriters Jamey Johnson and Tony Joe White – on the album's title track. \nCountry legend Willie Nelson discusses his new album 'God's Problem Child,' due out this spring.
