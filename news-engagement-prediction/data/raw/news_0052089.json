(Audrey Hall / Alfred A. Knopf) \nKirsch Award winner McGuane, the Montana novelist known for the books “Ninety-Two in the Shade,” “Panama” and “Nothing but Blue Skies,” was praised by Times film critic and Book Prizes director Kenneth Turan as “a master storyteller who mines the territory of loneliness and isolation but whose work is also tinged with humor and absurdity.” \nFor the first time, the L.A. Times Book Prizes will present an award for autobiographical prose. The Christopher Isherwood Prize, sponsored by the Isherwood Foundation and named for the British American writer whose semi-autobiographical writings inspired “Cabaret,” will be awarded to a work of “fiction, travel writing, memoir [or] diary.\" \nIsherwood Foundation Executive Director Katherine Bucknell said the organization is \"absolutely delighted\" to sponsor the new award. “Los Angeles was Christopher Isherwood’s adoptive home, and in 1984 he was awarded the Robert Kirsch Award for his own writing,\" she noted. \nThe inaugural finalists for the Isherwood Prize include Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowery's “They Can't Kill Us All: Ferguson, Baltimore, and a New Era in America's Racial Justice Movement,” “The Face: Strangers on a Pier” by Tash Aw and Jacqueline Woodson's novel \"Another Brooklyn.\" \nThe Los Angeles Times Book Prizes will be awarded on April 21, the evening before the L.A. Times Festival of Books begins on the campus of the University of Southern California. Tickets to the ceremony, which takes place at USC’s Bovard Auditorium, will be on sale starting March 16. \nThe complete list of finalists is below. \nBIOGRAPHY \n“Charlotte Brontë: A Fiery Heart” by Claire Harman \n“Mad Enchantment: Claude Monet and the Painting of the Water Lilies” by Ross King \n“Kill 'Em and Leave: Searching for the Real James Brown” by James McBride \n“Hitler: Ascent, 1889-1939” by Volker Ullrich (translated by Jefferson Chase) \n“Guilty Thing: A Life of Thomas De Quincey” by Frances Wilson \n\n“Secondhand Time: The Last of the Soviets” by Svetlana Alexievich (translated by Bela Shayevich) \n“Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City” by Matthew Desmond \n“Dark Money: The Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right” by Jane Mayer \n“City of Thorns: Nine Lives in the World's Largest Refugee Camp” by Ben Rawlence \n“A Rage for Order: The Middle East in Turmoil, from Tahrir Square to ISIS” by Robert F.
