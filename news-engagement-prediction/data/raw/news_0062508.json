(IE) If you thought WhatsApp departed from its conventional approach to become a social network, its co-founder Brian Acton has a message for you. Acton has said that term ‘Social’ is not a part of their vocabulary. Acton added that the company considers itself as a “communication service”, with the focus on communication and utility on conversation, and not necessarily the social constructs. Detailing his vision, Acton said that WhatsApp is intended to connect people to people who are known to each other. That may include one’s family, batch mate, friends, or some sort of businesses like their grocer or tailor. The Co-founder, who had found the app exactly eight years ago, says that company has alway thought of building “a private, secure, safe communication service”. However, Acton asserts that company has made changes in its traditional approach, and has started “creating the foundations of how businesses will engage with consumers.” Acton said that company will surely create “in a way that is clean, straightforward, simple and spam-free communication”. The techie adds that people have responded to their new development and remarks that the company is in “exploratory stage”. Speaking on the monetisation of App, Acton said that company is actively ideating on a bussiness modal which will preserve the utility and simplicity of our product and also create revenue at the same time.
