Facing off against Tristan Flore of France, who comprehensively beat him 4-0 last time the two met, expectations were not high. But Harmeet belied those hopes to emerge victorious. The World No 112 beat the Frenchman 11-4, 11-6, 11-9, 9-11, 9-11, 7-11, 11-6 in an epic contest to set up a battle with Koki Niwa of Japan, who beat A Amalraj, in the round of 16. After getting the better of the World No 77, Harmeet feels his European sojourn in 2016 helped him overcome his mental block against foreign opponents. The Surat paddler trained at the Portugal TT National Centre and Falkenberg Club in Sweden from September to December. “Most people forget I’m only 23. I still have age on my side, and will continue to improve. The process has started, and results will follow. I’ve also been playing in the Polish Superliga for Bydgoszcz, and playing abroad has definitely helped,” Harmeet told Express on Thursday. He played five team and eight singles matches for his club last year, and has been helped by the Gujarat government financially in his European quest. Harmeet believes such trips are the need of the hour for Indian players. “We’re technically sound, so going and playing in Europe exposes us to various styles. Europeans are defensive and playing there improves one’s defensive game. These skills come in handy while facing foreign opponents,” he noted. Harmeet still has a contract with Bydgoszcz, and plans to go back in July. There are other benefits of going abroad, apart from improving one’s game. “Staying abroad, you’ve to fend for yourself. Discipline levels go up because of the professionalism involved,” said the unseeded paddler, who had to come through qualifying in New Delhi. Harmeet also believes that fitness plays a vital part. “What we lack is footwork. We’re not even half as fit as the Europeans or Chinese. Also, when it comes to crunch situations, we usually falter. Mental conditioning is required to prosper.” Unable to make the Rio Olympics cut, Harmeet is desperate to succeed at the Commonwealth Games next year. “I need to become more consistent to break into the top 80 in the world rankings,” he signed off. ayantan@newindianexpress.com India results (Round of 32) Men: A Amalraj lost to K Niwa 0-4; AS Kamal bt C Akkuzu 4-1; S Shetty bt P Baum 4-2; S Ghosh lost to R Walther 3-4.
