In the last eight years -- more than 900 seats in state legislatures went from Democrat to Republican. And it's mostly the legislatures that draw the congressional districts,\" she said to Rep. Keith Ellison, a Minnesota liberal who is a frontrunner in the race.

It's not just about the White House. And when we fail to recognize that, we get into a whole lot of trouble, even when we have the White House, having our policies obstructed and trapped. And as you wind up in a situation like we are right now, where we don't have it, that's where we're really left out.\" JUST WATCHED ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:53:25.290+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
