Article continues below \nAnd yet there's still something underwhelming about the winger's albeit remarkable achievement. \nWhile scoring 100 goals for one club is brilliant, Arsenal fans might have hoped Walcott would have nearer 150 by now. Article continues below Sutton's manager reveals the 'amazing gesture' Arsenal made after their game \nIndeed, 100 goals in 10 seasons averages out at - you've guessed it - 10 goals per season, which is actually pretty poor. \nInjuries have plagued Walcott's career at the Emirates Stadium, but early signs suggested Arsene Wenger had signed a future superstar. That much is evident in the video Arsenal posted today to mark the Englishman's 100th club goal. \nIn the montage below, which features some of Walcott's finest efforts, it's clear the 27-year-old was hugely talented as a youngster with his pace and finishing. \nIt begs the question of why Walcott - who has failed to fulfil his vast potential - has taken over a decade to score 100 goals. WALCOTT 100 CLUB \nSince the day Walcott signed in 2006, Arsenal fans have said how he possesses incredible ability but doesn't use it properly. \nTake his first ever goal against Chelsea in the 2007 League Cup final. Walcott, who was 17 at the time, showed composure beyond his years to fire past Petr Cech. \nLater in the video, Walcott demonstrates his speed and eye for goal with efforts against Newcastle United, Chelsea (again) and Tottenham. \nWalcott has proved he can score any kind of goal, but it's ultimately inconsistency that has prevented him from reaching his potential and becoming world class. \nBrilliant one match and quiet the next, the England international has always struggled to consistently deliver the goods season after season. \nAnd that's a pretty sad reality because, when watching the above video, it genuinely feels like Arsenal potentially had the next Thierry Henry on their hands. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
