Although it’s been renovated and updated since the legendary Grateful Dead frontman lived there, his spirit, and a few relics, remain. The 1.1 acre-property in Stinson Beach, CA, was recently listed for $4.35 million. \nLocated in Marin County , the home is considered the “crown of Stinson Beach,” and sits adjacent to Mount Tamalpais State Park. It offers views from the Bolinas peninsula in the north to San Francisco in the south. The property was initially developed in 1947, and Garcia and his wife, Carolyn, came along in 1971 and bought it from a retired airline pilot. \nThe couple saw it as the perfect respite from Garcia’s busy touring and recording schedule. They raised their three daughters there and kept a number of pets, including a horse and a domesticated crow. \nGarcia entertained and jammed with other musical luminaries at Sans Souci, including Bob Dylan and John Lennon . He started the bluegrass band Old and in the Way with David Grisman and Peter Rowan on these very premises. The studio door, crafted with brass inlay by a local artisan, still stands today. \nBut it wasn’t just music legends who visited Sans Souci. Charles Reich and Annie Leibovitz visited for a Rolling Stone interview and photo session, which became a book titled, “ Garcia: A Signpost to New Space .” \nOf course Sans Souci was a bit more rustic and bucolic in the ’70s, according to listing agent Jon DiRienzo of Paragon Real Estate Group Marin . Today, the four-bedroom, 4.5-bathroom compound has everything a luxury home buyer desires, including open living spaces with vaulted ceilings and walls made of reclaimed wood. \nIt also has beautiful hardwood floors, sliding glass doors with automated window treatments, an open kitchen with Viking and Miele appliances, and smart home features. \nThere are three structures on the property, including the three-bedroom, 2.5-bath main house. Across the courtyard is a guest apartment and a guest cottage. The latter sits on the highest point of the property and features a clever sleeping loft that was once Garcia’s studio. \nOutside there’s a black-bottom pool and spa and a kitchen with a built-in grill and stove. The grounds feature California poppies, hydrangeas, and roses shaded by citrus, cypress, and redwood trees. \nIt sounds like the perfect place to unwind after a long, strange trip.
