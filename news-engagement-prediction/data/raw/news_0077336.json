Abrams and the success of Lost , a significant corner of genre fiction has been in thrall to the “mystery box.” As Abrams said during that now-infamous TED Talk back in 2007, the idea of a mystery box represents “infinite possibility.” It’s an enticing premise: any reader or viewer is naturally compelled by the need to know what might be in a closed box, letting their imagination run wild with the potential. \nThe problem arises when creators treat the mystery box as an end unto itself, when the mystery is confused for why people are invested in the story or franchise. Abrams himself betrayed the limits of this particular kind of conceit when he said, “I started to think that maybe there are times when mystery is more important than knowledge.” This thinking leads to unfulfilling conclusions and plots with faulty foundations. Westworld , despite becoming a massive cultural phenomenon last year, fell early and often into that trap by focusing on its puzzles, turning its characters into cyphers without believable wants and needs.\nA good mystery box show needs good characters I think the key to making a mystery box work is in balancing the unknown against well-written, relatable characters. 10 Cloverfield Lane , a film that felt like Die Hard in a post-apocalyptic bunker, got that right.

Now Legion , FX’s new drama set in the X-Men universe, is showing the strengths of the mystery box style of storytelling just three episodes into its run. Thanks to its characters and careful world-building, it’s swiftly becoming a show that earns its audiences obsessions and theories about what it all means — without sacrificing its own dramatic quality.\nHBO Comparisons between Legion and Westworld were immediate. As Polygon already noted , Redditors are going back and forth right now about how much Legion reminds them of Westworld in how mind-melting it is. “This is going to be Westworld levels of mind fuck I can tell,”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T16:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T16:57:31.078+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
