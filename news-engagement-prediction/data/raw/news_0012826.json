He's utilized that power in a very legal and constitutional power to ensure that we are safe, our country is safe our institutions are safe.

Instead, Trump should be praised for his desire to keep the country safe, Spicer said.\n\"It's a shame that we're not making sure to applaud the decision by the president to make a renewed focus and keep this country safe,\" he added.\nThe White House has been ripped for the executive order, both because of how it drafted the policy and what happened after it was signed. Critics have argued the order was sloppily written and excluded key input in order to get the president's protectionist agenda through with as little critique as possible.\nAfter it was signed, many of the people tasked with implementing the order didn't know what it said or what exactly they were supposed to be doing. The chaos led to thousands of people protesting at airports and in major cities across the country.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Pence: Trump's praise for Russia aimed at building anti-ISIS coalition He said more help is needed to fight the Islamic State.\nBy Kyle Feldscher • 02/06/17 8:22 AM  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T14:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T16:34:55.694+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
