Calcium crystals in the inner ear look like a boulder-strewn panorama. Blood cells enlarged 20,000 times loom like imposing doughnuts. (A person magnified that much would be 22 miles tall.) \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story For other projects his micro-cameras exposed cerebral hemorrhages, the virus that causes AIDS, and tar-laden smokers’ lungs to the naked eye. His first collection, tracing the development of an embryo, was perhaps the most celebrated, appearing in Life magazine in 1965 under the title “The Drama of Life Before Birth” and published in expanded book form as “A Child Is Born.” Using high-definition, three-dimensional ultrasound; a scanning electron microscope; advanced fiber optics; color filters to tint the photographic gray scale; and wide-angle lenses, Mr. Nilsson documented the journey to conception by some two million sperm as they swam six inches upstream from a woman’s cervix to the eggs traveling down her fallopian tubes. In other instances he recorded human reproduction through the processes of amniocentesis, in vitro fertilization, ectopic pregnancies (when the embryo develops outside the uterus) and miscarriages. “I am driven by a desire to illustrate vital processes that concern us all to the highest degree yet are invisible — to make them visible,” he said. “Such processes can take place inside the human body or in the life that exists on earth. I want to educate people and also increase their reverence for life.” Unwittingly or not, that reverence had political ramifications. His photographs of fetuses as early as 19 weeks old, with features clearly defined, provided ammunition for the anti-abortion movement, which circulated his photos.

His films won three Emmy Awards. Lars Olof Lennart Nilsson was born on Aug. 24, 1922, to the former Karin Linden and Nils Georg Nilsson, a railway worker and photographer, in Strangnas, Sweden, just west of Stockholm. \nAdvertisement In addition to his stepdaughter, he is survived by his second wife, Catharina Tjornedal; a stepson, Thomas Fjellstrom; and three grandchildren. A son, Kjell, from his first marriage, to Birgit Svensson, died in 2013. Ms. Svensson died in 1986. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.
