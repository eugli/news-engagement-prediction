Magu \nAdegboruwa also urged the senate not to entertain any further request for the confirmation of Magu as chairman. \nDefendants in the suit were the senate, the Attorney-General of the federation, the EFCC and Magu. \nAt the resumed hearing in the matter, yesterday, trial judge, Justice Mojisola Olatoregun, struck out the suit, following Adegboruwa’s application to withdraw the suit. \nCounsel to the applicant, Mr Tayo Oyetibo, SAN, while addressing the court, explained that his client had decided to discontinue with the case. \nOyetibo said that soon after he took over the case, he had to convince the applicant on the need to withdraw the case to encourage Magu in his current war against corruption \nHe said: “There is need to give Magu the opportunity to continue the anti-corruption campaign of the present administration and since this case may affect his confirmation, it is better to discontinue it.” \nThe defence counsel, Mr Wahab Shittu, who did not oppose the application for withdrawal, argued that the move would boost the anti-corruption war. \nOlatoregun accordingly struck out the suit as prayed. \nAdegboruwa in his 39-paragraphs affidavit in support of his earlier application for dismissal of Magu, traced his appointment back to November 9, 2015. adekunle ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T09:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:40:02.404+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
