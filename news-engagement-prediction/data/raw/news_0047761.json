Check and re-check its content,\" wrote one user on Facebook.\nAnother said: \"If this book is about sex education, why the description about it so detail?\"\n'Targeted at parents' One page of the book, which has been widely shared online, depicts a cartoon boy lying on a bed. He is saying: \"I crossed my legs around a bolster tightly. For fun, I move my body up and down. Oh... it feels good. My heart is pounding, but I am happy.\"\nIn another screenshot the child says: \"I found a new play for fun. Sometime, I put my hand inside my pants. I repeat, again and again.\"\nIn a Muslim majority nation like Indonesia, casual conversations about sex among adults are considered taboo, let alone discussions between parents and children.\n\"Minute by minute has passed, and I can't close my eyes.\" A page of a children book titled \"I learn to control myself.\" But there is a growing awareness about the importance of sex education for children, in part to prevent them from being sexually abused.\nDespite this, the Indonesian Child Protection Commission (KPAI) has said I Learn to Control Myself is harmful for children and could lead to \"sexual deviance\".\nMy life as a sex-trafficking victim Indonesia sex toy mistaken for 'angel' The publishers, Tiga Serangkai, said the book was meant to educate children about why they feel how they do, but that \"this behaviour is inappropriate and has potential health risks\".\n\"The target of this book is parents who feel their children might have this behaviour. But it also good for all parents and kids as a precaution.\"\nBut in their statement, they said they withdrew the book from circulation last December, because some communities were \"not ready to teach kids sex education from an early age\". Some online bookstores are, however, still selling it.\nAuthor Fita Chakra has written several educational book for children on issues about emotions and bodily development.\nShe said on Instagram that she felt sad people were just posting one or two page of the book in question out of context.\n\"I intensely discussed with the editor about this book long before it was published,\" she said. \"The writing process took a long time,\" she said.\n\"Our true intention is to educate children how to protect themselves from sexual abuse. If you read it through, there is a page about tips to parents, because this book is meant to be read with parents' guidance.\"\nChild and family psychologist Vera Itabiliana told the BBC that while it is important to teach children about sexuality in an early age, the book was targeting the wrong audience.\nFor this particular issue, she said, it would be best if the book was made for parents only, so they can educate their children.\n\"You should not read this book together with your kids,\" she said. \"Because even though the behaviour is quite common among children between five and six years old, you cannot generalise the trend. Some other children didn't do it.\"\n\"So when you put it into a book, and every children can read it, one who didn't even know will feel curious and try.\"\nThis is not the first time a book created controversy in Indonesia.
