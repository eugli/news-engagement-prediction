Andrew M. Cuomo announced last month that the two reactors at Indian Point plant in Buchanan, about 30 miles north of Manhattan, would cease operating by 2021. Credit Uli Seit for The New York Times New York could do without the power generated by the Indian Point nuclear plant, but making up for the loss of all that cheap electricity would be much easier if state officials changed their energy-efficiency policies. That is a conclusion of a report issued on Thursday by two environmental groups on the implications of the long-running campaign to shut down Indian Point. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced last month that the two reactors at the plant in Buchanan, about 30 miles north of Manhattan, would cease operating by 2021. Mr. Cuomo and environmental groups — including the two that issued the report, Riverkeeper and the Natural Resources Defense Council — have railed against Indian Point for years, arguing that it posed a significant hazard in such a populous area. But supporters of the plant questioned how the state would replace the low-cost, carbon-free power produced there. Indian Point’s two working reactors can produce about 16 million megawatt-hours of electricity per year, or about one-fourth of the amount consumed in New York City and Westchester County. A proposed transmission line could carry enough hydroelectric power to the city from Canada to make up for about half of Indian Point’s output. The rest of the shortfall would have to come from other sources — gas-fired plants, solar panels or windmills — or by reducing demand. The report determined that the new sources would not be necessary if the state more aggressively pursued efficient use of electricity. It cited Massachusetts and Rhode Island as examples that New York’s regulators could follow to drive down consumption. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Those two states have been shaving about 3 percent off their electricity use annually by providing incentives for shifting to more efficient lighting , appliances and heating and cooling systems, according to the report, which was produced by Synapse Energy Economics in Cambridge, Mass. That is about three times the pace at which New York has been improving its efficiency. “New York can do even more” in pressing for energy efficiency, said Paul Gallay, the president of Riverkeeper. By doing so, state officials could “eliminate any need whatsoever for nonrenewable energy to replace Indian Point.” Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.
