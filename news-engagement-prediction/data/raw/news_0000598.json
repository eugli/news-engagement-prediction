The F-35 comes in three configurations, the A-model for the U.S. Air Force and U.S. allies; a F-35 B-model which can handle short takeoffs and vertical landings for the Marine Corps and the British navy; and carrier-variant F-35C jets for the U.S. Navy. \nThe U.S. Defense Department expects to spend $391 billion in the coming decades to develop and buy 2,443 of the supersonic warplanes. © 2017 Thomson Reuters ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T05:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T06:38:12.457+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
