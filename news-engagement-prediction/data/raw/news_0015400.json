(Mike Symington/CBC)\n\"It's such a cool gig,\" he said from behind the Korg Triton organ that often prompts enthusiastic \"Go Flames Go\" chants from roughly 20,000 fans.\n\"Yeah, it's cheerleading. And hopefully me leading with the right song.\"\nThe gig was passed to the longtime pianist when the Flames still played in the Stampede Corral .\n\"I got to play one period in the Corral. Boy, that is unreal… That is a perfect venue. So tight and crowded and people on either side of you,\" he said.\nA panel of \"hugely-marked up\" Plexiglas was the only thing stopping pucks from striking, but it was tough to see the game.\n\"It's that or get beaned a thousand times a game,\" laughed Joosen.\nEarly musical roots Born in Holland, his dad played euphonium and tuba in the symphony when he came to Canada.\nJoosen came over when he was one year old, but his parents always spoke Dutch in the home.\n\"Kindergarten ... it was like I hit a wall. Nobody could understand me and I couldn't understand them. Mom says I just zipped up for a year and came out English after that.\"\nCalgary Flames organ player Willy Joosen has seen the Saddledome undergo many changes since starting with the team in 1988. (Mike Symington/CBC)\nHe went to Currie Elementary and started taking music lesson around the age of six, but gravitated towards the piano.\nHe like doing things his way, but was taught in the classics — like Bach.\n\"It's always been a passion,\" said Joosen. \nHe liked to entertain his pals with the Charlie Brown Christmas song. The best advice he ever received was from \na jazz pianist, who played with greats like Chet Baker and told him that it's all about synchronizing strong beats and tones.\nJoosen grew up in Calgary, and ended up gigging at Oliver's Old Bailey downtown above Lucifer's. He would play  Moon River while disco pumped under the floor below. \nHe would play in hotel lobbies or theatre projects, like ATP's  Sweeney Todd or  Leader of the Pack at Stage West. He also just signed up to perform in the Stampede Grandstand Show.\n\"And right after that, summer of '88, I got the call.\" said Joosen, adding it was the right place, right time.\nKeeping with the times \nInspiration struck in 1993. A visiting organist, who got booed because he was from San Jose, taught him to keep a binder and search for new songs.\nNow he keeps his songlist current, as do many other organ players part of the NHL circuit. They've kept in contact over the years, sharing which songs tend to be real crowd pleasers.\nHarvey the Hound also plays a part in ramping up the crowd, sometimes helping the crowd chant \"Go Flames Go.\" (Mike Symington/CBC)\nHe's also keeps current with help from his son, who plays organ for the Hitmen and subs in for him every once and a while.\nThe goal is a good call and response, but that means rearranging songs on the fly. He played the Game of Thrones  theme on a request after watching a quick YouTube video. \n\"You never know how long a whistle breaks or how often,\" said Joosen. \"So you find the hook and get some participation going.\"\nOver the years Joosen has seen many changes: new seating in the Saddledome, the organ moving around the arena and producers who work behind the scenes for a smooth game.\nCalgary Flames say stand-alone fieldhouse would cost city $260M \n\"I really love it,\" he said. \nJoosen was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma in 1995 and went through treatment. While the chemotherapy drugs affected his energy, he always asked himself, \"What else are you going to do?\" \nHe has no plans of stopping and gets into the groove before games now about 90 minutes before the puck drops.\nThe best part of the job? Joosen says that's keeping 20,000 people focused on the game.\nThe worst part — losing. Because after all, he was a Flames fan years before he sat behind the organ.\nMORE CALGARY NEWS |  Calgary priest skips Sunday church after scoring Super Bowl tickets MORE CALGARY NEWS |  Lifestyle changes can cut some cancer risks by half, says longevity columnist \n\n\n\nWith files from Mike Symington", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T01:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T10:20:33.548+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
