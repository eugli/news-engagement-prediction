NEW WORLD ORDER \nIt wasn’t just in WCW either, as we saw an nWo stint in the WWE as well – although it went down as a big failure. SIGN UP NOW \nWant to become a GMS writer?

Article continues below Watch: Man United fans absolutely love Wayne Rooney's reaction to Ibrahimovic's winner \nHe said: “I think it was a failure. The nWo experiment in the WWF was a failure. I think the idea was good. The execution was not. There were a lot of things, hindsight being 20/20, that maybe we should have done a little differently. It just wasn’t meant to be. A FAILURE \n“I do remember something a little bit about that, but these were simply just conversations taking place, ‘hey, what are you doing?’, ‘when’s your deal up?’, ‘would you be interested in going to work when your deal’s up and coming back and making some money?’ \n“I don’t know that Scott was in the greatest place at the time. But I do remember rumblings back and forth and a conversation with Shane, that Shane was pretty disillusioned as far as doing anything. \n“[Nash’s] name was brought up from time to time, but the sentiments were always pretty much the same and that’s what they were, that they just would be a cancer in the locker room and do we need that right now with the locker room that we have? \n“That was unanimous for the most part. The agents, the writers, everybody. Somewhat, yeah [that was McMahon’s opinion as well]. It probably wasn’t Triple H’s take, no. Triple H was an advocate for them to come back. \n“Vince’s philosophy was ‘have a happy dressing room – if you have a happy dressing room, I don’t care what the business is as long as I don’t have a bunch of strife and bulls**t in the dressing room.’ \n\"We had a happy dressing room at that time. We had guys working together, making money, and busting their ass. There was concern about bringing in a disruptive force that might have jeopardised that.” \nWhy do you think nWo failed in WWE?
