Over 87,800 American warfighters are still officially listed as MIA, while over 130,000 Americans have been held as POWs since World War II.\n“The Freedom Car is part of a joint effort to raise awareness for the cause of Prisoners of War and Missing in Action service members of the United States military,” said Tony Galati, Founder and CEO of MyComputerCareer. “Team Johnson Motorsports, the Freedom Car drivers, and MyComputerCareer hope to inspire and educate others about the great service and sacrifice provided by all servicemen and servicewomen, but especially by Prisoners-of-War and the Missing-in-Action.”\nAnyone interested in learning more about MyComputerCareer should visit www.mycomputercareer.edu or speak to a Career Advisor by calling 866-606-6922.\nAbout MyComputerCareer.edu\nLaunched in 2007, MyComputerCareer .edu provides technical training, certification preparation and job placement support for adult learners looking to enter the Information Technology industry, as well as professionals seeking career advancement.
