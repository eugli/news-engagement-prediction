John McCain (R-Ariz.) announced in a statement that the Senate Armed Services Committee will investigate the White House over Kremlin ties, noting that Flynn's resignation \"raises further questions about the Trump administration's intensions toward Vladimir Putin's Russia.\" \nBut Paul — who is on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee — argued that an investigation wasn't necessary, since Trump had apparently already taken care of business. \n\"That might be excessive,\" Paul said. \"I think it looks like the President has handled the situation, and unless there's some kind of other evidence of malfeasance, this sounds like something that was internal White House politics, and it looks like the President's handled it.\" Michael Flynn resigned as national security adviser on Monday. (CARLOS BARRIA/REUTERS) \nA few hours after Paul's Fox interview, The New York Times reported that several members on the Trump team were in repeated touch with senior Russian intelligence officials during the campaign. \nNews outlines what may have happened with Flynn, Russia and Trump \nThe revelation raises serious concerns over just how extensive contacts have been between the Trump team and the Kremlin. Trump repeatedly praised President Putin during the campaign, and has refused to accept the U.S. intelligence community's consensus that Russia meddled in the 2016 election to help him win the White House. \nFurthermore, both Democrats and Republicans have expressed outrage over the revelation that Trump knew Flynn had been discussing sanctions with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak, but apparently chose to do nothing for nearly three weeks.

John McCain said Flynn's resignation \"raises further questions about the Trump administration's intensions toward Vladimir Putin's Russia.\" (Win McNamee/Getty Images) \nNonetheless, Paul appeared more concerned with the fact that the National Security Agency surveils phone calls than the notion that Trump officials regularly spoke with Russian intelligence officials. \n\"I'm not insinuating the NSA had anything to do with his, I'm just saying that we have to realize that we have given power to an agency to record not only every American's phone calls, but even the President's phone calls,\" he said.
