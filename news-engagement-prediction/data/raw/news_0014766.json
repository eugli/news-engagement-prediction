What is psoriasis? \nThe condition causes red and crusty patches with silvery scales to flare-up on the skin. \nThey normally appear on the elbows, knees, scalp, and lower back, but can crop up anywhere on the body. \nThe patches can sometimes be itchy or sore. \nRoughly 2% of the population are affected by psoriasis and and the number is roughly split equally between men and women. \nIts severity varies from person to person and for some people it is merely a small irritation. \nIn more serious cases it can have a crushing impact on a sufferer’s life. \n“A lot of people ask why I wear a lot of make-up but I have shared photos before on social media to show the difference in my face. \n“I beg any girls who have psoriasis and cover it up with make-up to moisturise your face properly before you transform yourself. \n“I hope to encourage people in a similar positon to be comfortable with their psoriasis. \n“I’ve already received so much support on social media and people in a similar position always ask me how I cope through it.” \nIt is widely considered that psoriasis has no cure, although in 2016 a teenager who lived in agony with severe psoriasis was “cured thanks to cancer drugs” .
