Guy Benson OWNS Dan Pfeiffer for claiming ‘rich people in expensive suits’ are taking Obamacare away Posted at 9:58 am on February 20, 2017 by Sam J. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nOh look, another Democrat played the ‘evil rich people’ card, this time with Obamacare. It’s cute how they like to create narratives that don’t actually exist, as if the GOP is full of these evil rich people looking to take health care away from the poor. \nSeriously, who thinks like that? \nWait, they do. Never mind. Great meeting this morning on @POTUS plan to repeal & replace Obamacare. The American people deserve much better, and they will get it. pic.twitter.com/2GQpygenJ3 \n— Reince Priebus (@Reince45) February 19, 2017 A bunch of rich people meeting at a fancy club in expensive suits deciding how to take health care from the working class Trump voters https://t.co/3KdXej6mOY \n— Dan Pfeiffer (@danpfeiffer) February 20, 2017 Trending Set phasers for BACKFIRE: George Takei deletes Twitter poll after something goes hilariously awry \nSays the rich guy in a suit surrounded by other rich guys in suits. \nWhy would he even try that nonsense, especially when Obamacare isn’t really care in the first place? That and the law actually did make health care less accessible for millions of Americans. Obamacare ripped millions from their preferred coverage, a betrayal of your boss' false vow. It's harming more ppl than it's helping. https://t.co/QZaUVghy67 \n— Guy Benson (@guypbenson) February 20, 2017 \nBam. And it has now for years. \nMillions of Americans lost their plans and had no choice but to accept more expensive coverage that provided less care due to high deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. @guypbenson Got some stats to back that up? \nSo glad you asked … @jimmybo50 millions lost their plans. That's established fact. And Gallup's findings are in line w/ others: https://t.co/HWWE5l8gCg \n— Guy Benson (@guypbenson) February 20, 2017 \nD’oh! Ask and you shall receive. @guypbenson Not only was my coverage no longer available to me, I could not afford ACA w/my slightly above \"cut off\" earnings, so IRS fine \n— Chris W. (@multitasker333) February 20, 2017 \nOh yeah, that piece as well. Punishing Americans with a tax because they can’t afford a product the government wants to force them to buy. \nBut sure, let’s complain about the rich guys in suits trying to fix the mess those other rich guys in suits created.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T17:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T17:50:44.537+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
