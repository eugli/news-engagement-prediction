I like curves and light,’ says Ms. Bicici. Devin Groody … Ms. Bicici paid $2.8 million in 2008 for the waterfront property and an older house that she tore down. She then spent approximately $4 million and three years building the 4,079-square-foot shingle home. The custom-made chandelier in the library was modeled on one she saw in a Byzantine church in Istanbul. Devin Groody … Ms. Bicici has been collecting cookbooks for 20 years. ‘I read them. They’re not for show,’ she says. The adjustable shelves in the library are glass to let light into the center of the house. It took three tries to get the right library ladder as she wanted something sturdy but lightweight and easy to move. Devin Groody … Ms. Bicici, who works in money management, displays her collection of pots on the upper shelves in the rotunda. The cookware includes pots from Japan, Korea, Turkey and Egypt. ‘Some of the pots are for baking bread, some are for making beans, some are for making beef bourguignon,’ she says. Devin Groody … ‘The whole idea of being in a waterfront house is the light bounces in through the house. So you keep all the spaces as open as possible, thus the light and view goes from one space to the other,’ says architect Roger Bartels, age 75, of Pagliaro Bartels Sadja Architects. The home has three bedrooms and a den which could also be used as a bedroom. The second floor master suite is 1,100 square feet, says Ms. Bicici. Devin Groody … Ms. Bicici’s office looks out at the water. ‘It’s very Zen, very pleasant,’ she says. To increase the view, the architects curved the facade in two circular bays, says Mr. Bartels. Devin Groody … The dining room looks out at a Japanese-inspired garden. Ms. Bicici collected the glassware on the shelves. Devin Groody … ‘I love white in the house so you can play with the rest and use color elsewhere. White makes it beach-y and clean and light,’ says Ms. Bicici. Devin Groody … Ms. Bicici has more than 30 cake stands, some of which are shown here. ‘It’s my escape,’ she says of cooking. Devin Groody … The television in the master bedroom comes up out of a console at the foot of the bed. Ms. Bicici chose the silk curtains to add color to the room. Devin Groody … Ms. Bicici did not want a traditional bathroom and told her architects about ones she liked in Bali and Japan. The wood is teak and the counters are cement. The pebble tiles came from Bali. Devin Groody … ‘Roger designed a beautiful bathroom for me, but I said, “This is like any other New England bathroom,’ “ she says. ‘I said, “Roger, you can do better.“ I told him about the bathrooms in Asia. I said I wanted the tub to be like an infinity pool.’ The bathroom includes a refrigerated cabinet for the hand-made skin care products that Ms. Bicici gets from a local aesthetician. Devin Groody … Mr. Bartels designed a glass barn door for the entrance to the master bedroom. ‘Roger designed it so light would still come in if I chose to lose the door,’ says Ms. Bicici. Devin Groody … ‘When you push a few things around you can get your yoga mat out,’ says Ms. Bicici of the meditation room on the third floor. Ms. Bicici is selling as she has decided to move to a townhouse in New York City which she is redoing using the same architect. Devin Groody … ‘I love the architecture, the curves, the light, the use of stone,’ says Ms. Bicici. The home sits on .28 acres and includes a dock. The house has an asking price of $7.795 million. Edward Mortimer of Sotheby’s International Realty has the listing.
