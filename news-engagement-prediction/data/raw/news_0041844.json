Hopefully, they’ll either back my belief or throw it in the water.” \nIt's one thing to question science, that's something many scientists would actually encourage because it can actually lead to new developments, but it's pretty tough to deny that the Earth is round when we have pictures and people that have seen it's spherical. \nAlso, when archaeologists have discovered bones and have been able to piece together skeletons of prehistoric animals and link them back accurately to animals living today, it's hard to disprove that dinosaurs didn't look a certain way as it would go against their bone structure. \nUnless we send Irving into outer space to see the Earth and back in time to see the dinosaurs, he'll probably keep on believing his theories about them.
