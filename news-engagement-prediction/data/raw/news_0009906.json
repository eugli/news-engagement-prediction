Psyonix, developers of the popular rocket-powered soccer video game, have announced their first ever range of toy cars . The mini pull-back racers are made by Zag Toys and will go on sale this spring. Like Minecraft ’s Lego merchandise, Rocket League toy cars make perfect sense, although we are a bit disappointed there’s no actual gameplay involved — offering, for example, mini goals and remote-controlled cars. 12 different car models will be going on sale, including Octane, Dominus, Masamune, Hotshot, Grog, X-Devil, Merc, and Backfire, as well as four “limited variants.” Each car comes in its own miniature Rocket Ball, and Psyonix says there will be unique in-game content downloadable with each purchase. Prices and exact availability for the cars are still unknown, but you can sign up for alerts from Zag Toys if you want to be in the know first.
