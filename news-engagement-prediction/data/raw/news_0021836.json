Guardiola has been equally vocal in public. Pep Guardiola, left, has preferred Gabriel Jesus (Photo: Getty Images) \nBut by dropping one of the Premier League ’s best and most prolific strikers - he has scored 18 goals in 26 games this season - then Guardiola must have known the decision would be a huge talking point. \nFormer Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss Guardiola was the most sought after coach in world football when City snapped him up last year. \nBut Guardiola arrived having done something similar at Barcelona with Samuel Eto’o , dumping the Cameroon striker on the strength of a “feeling.” Read More A reminder for Pep Guardiola: Sergio Aguero is officially the best Premier League goalscorer EVER \nThe Eto’o fued still lingers as the ex-Chelsea striker has since recalled of their row: “As a coach, he had proven nothing. He came in and didn't even know the story of the dressing room.” \nGuardiola also had something of a falling out with Zlatan Ibrahimovic and the Swedish superstar suggested earlier this season that Jose Mourinho is a better man manager.

Aguero clearly has some frustrations while Guardiola has on more than a couple of occasions suggested that the Argentinian must work harder for the team. \nGuardiola always looks for dynamism and hard work from his players, that must have an ability to drop deeper and you would never be allowed just to be an out-and-out striker. Zlatan has suggested Jose Mourinho is a better boss after he also failed to gel with the Spaniard (Photo: Getty Images) \nThat is why Jesus appeals to City, his work rate, pace and power together with his ability to drift wide, play in different positions. \nThere would be no shortage of takers if Aguero does become available, Paris Saint Germain and Real Madrid would be interested. Read More How Pep Guardiola condemned Zlatan Ibrahimovic to Barcelona failure BEFORE he arrived at Camp Nou \nSelling Aguero would be a major shock because City would be getting rid one of the biggest names in the Premier League. \nBut if you hire a big-name manager then the only way he can possibly succeed is to manage his way. They have brought him on because of his coaching CV - and with that comes a ruthless reputation. \nBut one myth can be blown away.
