ALDEN WILLIAMS/FAIRFAX NZ \nThe fire on Summit Road above the Sign of the Kiwi on Monday, the second large fire of the evening. \nFire engines and helicopters battled the out-of-control blaze off Early Valley Rd, which left hillside paddocks blackened and destroyed at least one house, Fire Service spokeswoman Lyn Crosson said. \nREAD MORE: * Huge fire prompts state of emergency in Hawke's Bay \nAt least three helicopters and eight city and rural fire engines were called in to fight the Lansdowne fire.

SUPPLIED/HELEN STANTON \nThe fire rages on the Port Hills in Christchurch. \n\"There should be a rule that, if it is peak fire season and the weather is dry and there is a northwest wind blowing, a fire on the Port Hills needs helicopters.\" \nBy 9.30pm, Causer said flames had reached the 60 hectares of mature forest on his property and were burning between 60 to 70 metres high. Helicopters had since stopped battling the blaze, unable to fly at night. \n\"All we can do is pray, but really there is no chance, the flames are just going to spread.
