When asked about marrying Hrithik Roshan, Saba said, \"Who is going to marry the father of two kids, he is not my cup of tea.\"\n\nSalman Khan \nShe also responded to questions on Emraan Hashmi's smooch fest on screen by saying, \"I do not want mouth cancer, no, no.\" Saba didn't stop there. On seeing Riteish Deshmukh's picture, she responded, \"Look, I'm an A-list actress in Pakistan. I work only with A-listers.\n\nHrithik Roshan \n\" She didn't even spare superstar Salman Khan and termed him a \"chhichhora\" (loafer). \"Bahut chhichhore hai aap! He doesn't follow the choreographer at all. He invents his own styles. Kuch bhi! What is this, man?\" she said. The actress later issued a statement, which read, \"It was a fun show.\n\nRiteish Deshmukh \nI love and respect the Indian film industry.
