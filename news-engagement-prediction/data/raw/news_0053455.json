Alamy 2 Researchers examined more than 300 children and found that in almost half of stroke cases a headache was reported \nThis prompted doctors to examine how frequently headache pain occurs in childhood stroke and whether headache pain is related to the reason of the stroke. \nDr Lori Billinghurst, the study’s lead author and assistant professor of neurology at the University of Pennsylvania, said: “Stroke should be considered as a possible diagnosis in any child with a headache and additional symptoms of weakness or numbness – in the face, arm, or leg – or changes in walking, talking, or vision. \n“Urgent brain imaging may be required to distinguish a migraine with aura from a stroke.” \nResearchers looked at whether headache was noted at the onset of clot-caused stroke in 355 children. \nThey found that in six per cent of cases in kids under three, and 46 per cent of cases of children older than three a headache was reported. \nIt is possible that younger brains have blood vessels that are more easily distended and more likely to activate pain sensors that trigger headache Dr Lori Billinghurst University of Pennsylvania \nThat is far higher than the estimated percentage of adults who experience a headache with an ischaemic stroke – one caused by a blood clot in the brain, the researchers said. \nThe findings were presented at the American Stroke Association’s International Stroke Conference this week. \nThe researchers warned younger children may not be able to communicate the pain they are feeling before having the stroke. \nAbnormalities in blood vessel walls are the most common reason for stroke in children , but a headache did not distinguish between children with artery abnormalities and children with other stroke-causing problems. Act FAST - IF YOU SPOT ONE SIGN DIAL 999 \nThe Act FAST campaign asks people to learn the signs someone could be suffering a stroke. \nFAST stands for: \n– FACE … has the person’s face fallen on one side? Can they still smile? \n– ARMS … can they raise both their arms and keep them there? \n– SPEECH … is their speech slurred? \n– TIME … if you spot any single one of these signs it’s time to dial 999 straight away Getty Images 2 Abnormalities in blood vessel walls are the most common reason for stroke in children \nDr Billinghurst said: “It is possible that younger brains have blood vessels that are more easily distended and more likely to activate pain sensors that trigger headache. \n“It is also possible that inflammation – a powerful activator of pain sensors – may be more important in the processes underlying stroke in children than in adults. \n“The study has already shown that inflammation plays a key role in the vascular injury pathway in children with stroke. \nRELATED STORIES BOOZE WARNING Drinking more than a pint a day 'puts men at higher risk of heart attack or stroke' ACT FAST SAVE LIVES New portable brain scanner could help paramedics diagnose stroke in MINUTES - saving thousands of lives 'I spent £1.3k on takeaways in a month' 29st mum who gorged on EIGHT McDonald's a day sheds half her body weight after having a stroke OBESE KIDS HEART SCARE Lazy children see signs of heart disease and at higher risk of stroke from as young as SIX Don’t go brekking my heart Skipping breakfast could leave you at risk of a heart attack, stroke or diabetes, medics warn \n\n“We will be doing further work to see if there are differences in blood markers of inflammation in those with and without headache at time of stroke.” \nHowever, researchers warned doctors should not yet use the presence of a headache to determine the cause of a stroke. \nDr Billinghurst added: “We would like to conduct a study of children who enter hospital emergency rooms with headache and suspected stroke to see whether there are characteristics of the headache or other neurologic symptoms that predict whether a stroke will be confirmed on imaging. \n“We would like to develop a predictive formula that can help physicians diagnose stroke more rapidly and enable earlier, perhaps life-saving, stroke treatments.” \nWe pay for your stories!
