Where do I even begin? Let’s play mad libs: a SUBSTANCE-ABUSE COUNSELOR drank 3 shots and a beer IN HER CAR before she ran into a HALF-NAKED MAN who got STUCK IN HER WINDSHIELD. She drove for TWO MILES before a group of people said “HEY LADY THERE’S A DEAD GUY IN YOUR FUCKING WINDSHIELD!” \nHoly fucking shit. I take pride in having a pretty twisted mind, but this story is just mind-blowing. So many questions. How can a substance abuse counselor go to work everyday, counsel people on drinking in moderation, and then mistake her car for a bar? Why was the guy she killed half-naked, and was his top half or his bottom half naked? And most importantly… how did she not realize he was IN the windshield?! I don’t care how shitfaced you are. Picture this: you’re driving along, all of a sudden WHAM, CRUNCH, AI ! GASP. DEAD. Hey, there’s a draft in here, little breezy. Did I open a window? Nope. Everything’s normal, I’ll just keep driving. Oh look, I have a passenger. I don’t recall anyone asking me for a ride. He’d be a lot more comfortable in the seat, but to each his own. Wonder where his shirt went. \n2 miles later… \nOh hey guys, what’s up? Oh that guy? Yeah he’s… I don’t know his name. Picked him up a couple miles back. Doesn’t say much. Dead? Really? Shit. \n25 years seems about right.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:11:06.671+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
