(PTI) \nNaga People’s Front (NPF) President Shurozelie Liezitsu was selected as a consensus candidate by the Democratic Alliance of Nagaland for the post of Chief Minister. Liezitsu will be sworn as the Chief Minister of Nagaland on February 22. Earlier yesterday, Nagaland’s Chief Minister TR Zeliang did an O Panneerselvam on Monday evening as he stepped down from his post. According to PTI, the resignation was later accepted by Nagaland Governor P B Acharya. As a result of the unexpected resignation, an urgent party meeting was called on Monday where the decision over the new Chief Minister was to be taken. \nOn Saturday, a new political crisis started in the state of Nagaland. Over 40 legislators of Naga People’s Front (NPF) party were moved to a resort in Kaziranga National Park in the neighbouring state of Assam. The MLAs wanted to replace Chief Minister T R Zeliang by former Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio. Zeliang had been under fire for handling protests against the quota for women in urban local bodies which was then followed by violence. Hours after he had been deserted by his party legislators, who had earlier backed him as the next Nagaland Chief Minister, ruling Naga People’s Front (NPF) supremo, Shurhozelie Liezietsu on Saturday exuded confidence that the MLAs will return to the party fold. Liezietsu’s statement was significant when majority of the legislators, who had backed him on Wednesday night to replace Zeliang, switched sides on Friday night and threw their weight behind state’s lone Lok Sabha member Neiphiu Rio. \nAlso watch: \n“The party (NPF) organisation is intact and that nothing would go wrong since we still hold the trump card,” Liezietsu said addressing an emergency meeting of the NPF Central Executive Council and the Central Office Bearers, along with the Division Presidents, on Saturday evening at his residence here. On Wednesday, 42 of the 49 legislators had unanimously supported NPF supremo Liezietsu as their new legislature party leader to break the deadlock between the agitating groups and the government.
