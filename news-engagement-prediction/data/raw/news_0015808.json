Much of the spot's moving story, however, was cut off and banned from the big game's broadcast because FOX deemed it as too controversial. Although an edited version of the commercial appeared during the Super Bowl, the company was ultimately forced to release the full version on YouTube, where it has since been viewed more than 3.6 million times. The six-minute extended version of the ad follows a mother and a daughter who brave a long and, at times, perilous journey on foot to America from Mexico. They finally reach the border, only to find that it's blocked with a massive wall, crushing their American dreams. But moments later, they spot a wooden door in the wall and he ad ends with them pushing it open and running through. Then, a final cut shows a construction worker who appears to have just finished building the entrance himself followed by the words, \"The will to succeed is always welcome here.\" As you can imagine, critics of the commercial say it promotes and glorifies illegal immigration into the US. But in response to negative comments on YouTube, 84 Lumber contends that it doesn't condone illegal immigration and that the journey in the commercial symbolizes \"grit, dedication, and sacrifice,\" characteristics it values as a company. Oh, and it's worth pointing out that the characters entered the country right through the wall's doorway, and not by some illegal or nefarious means. Regardless of your political stance on the issue, you have to admit the story of love and struggle is beautiful, moving, and inspiring. Watch the whole thing for yourself above.
