Dr Karl Kruszelnicki explains. \nLightning is so impressive that when it happens it stops you in your tracks. Many have asked, \"Why don't we capture this awesome power, and use it to power our industries and boil our kettles?\" \nLightning flashes into existence about 1.4 billion times each year across the whole planet. \nThis electrical tension between the bottom of the cloud and the ground can be huge—in extreme cases, it can make your hair stand on end. \nOne-and-a-half billion lightning bolts sounds like a lot, but only about one quarter of them get to the ground. The rest of the lightning happens either within a single cloud or from one cloud to another. \nWe still don't fully understand how a bolt of lightning gets started, but we have some idea. \nThe process begins inside a thunderstorm, where the two important ingredients are located. First, there's air moving rapidly upwards, and second, there are freezing temperatures (ranging between 15 and 25 degrees below zero). \nThese rather perverse conditions produce three types of water. First, and rather surprisingly, there's some actual liquid water in the shape of small droplets that are super-cooled. \nSecond, as you would expect, there are small crystals of hail. Third, and again a bit unexpected, there are quite large blobs of soft hail with the unusual name of \"graupel\". Graupel is between two and five millimetres across, and occurs when super-cooled water freezes on the outside of, say, a snowflake. \nThanks to the strong updrafts of wind, the graupel runs into the other two types of water (the small super-cooled droplets and the small ice hail). Via a complicated process, they become positively charged, while the graupel becomes negatively charged. \nThe super-cooled water droplets and hail are much smaller and lighter, so the strong up-currents of wind inside the thundercloud carry them upwards. This process makes the top of the thundercloud become positively charged. \nThe positive charges repel each other. This is part of the reason that you get the so-called \"anvil\"—the large flattened area at the top of a thundercloud. \nThe third type of water, the graupel, is larger and heavier than the two other types, and either stays where it is in the strong updraft or falls to the bottom of the cloud. \nEither way, the bottom of the cloud becomes negatively charged. This negative charge on the bottom of the cloud induces a positive charge on the ground, a kilometre or more below. \nDid you know Great Moments In Science is a podcast?

Eventually, over about a 20,000th of a second, a lightning strike stutters its way towards the ground in a series of steps. Each step is about 45 metres long—a tad smaller than an Olympic swimming pool. \nThis downward-going lightning bolt is clearly visible—even though it's travelling at about 200 kilometres a second. It's carrying about 10-100 amps of current. For comparison, 10 amps running a domestic electrical heater will make the power cable a bit warm, while 100 amps is a bit more than your entire house can draw from the electrical grid. \nNow this downstroke—impressive as it is—is just the warmup for the main event. On its way down, the downstroke has blasted a conductive pathway between the bottom of the cloud and the ground. What happens next is the return stroke—which is much more powerful and yet kind of invisible. \nInstead of carrying 10-100 amps of current, it carries 30,000 amps—sometimes as much as 120,000. This stupendous amount of current is enough to create temperatures 10 times hotter than the surface of the Sun—50,000 degrees. This causes the characteristic blue-white colour of a lightning bolt. \nThe air is heated almost instantaneously, making it expand explosively, producing a shock wave, which we hear as thunder. \nBut it's kind of invisible because it's moving so fast. \nWhile the downstroke of the lightning strike moves at about 200 kilometres a second, the upward return stroke zips along at 100,000 kilometres a second—about one third of the speed of light. \nAll you see with the naked eye is the slower downward strike and a really bright flash of light from the upward return stroke. \nThe only way you can \"see\" the upward movement of the return stroke is if you use a military-industrial-scientific-grade ultra-high-speed camera—otherwise all you see is a flash.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:58:22.739+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
