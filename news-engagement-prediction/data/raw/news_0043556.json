US COAST GUARD / EPA FILE 4 FTSE has had to pay out billions in compensation, fines and clean-up costs since the disaster in 2010 \nThe Deepwater Horizon disaster of April 20 , 2010, killed 11 workers and created the worst environmental disaster ever in the US. \nIt released a cocktail of nasty toxic chemicals, or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), into marine life habitats. \nBut the infamous event could now help shed a light on the effect widespread pollution is having on humanity, according to a chilling new study by Manchester and Stanford scientists.
