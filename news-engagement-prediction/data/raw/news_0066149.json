This clown had inboxed me and asked that I release the full set of naked images in my column.'\nShe noted: 'To be clear, this wasn't footage of a randy star salivating at the mouth wanging their bits about while fishing for a random on Skype for a sex sesh. This was private stuff, sent between two people.'\nPosing up a storm: Her hair wound into an updo, she'd slipped on a pair of high-waisted, loose white slacks and gleaming stilettos\nRefusing to release the photos, Wood snapped in her column: 'I know there are some demented people out there, but I cannot get my head around how sick it is.'\nMailOnline has heard from a representative from Ratajkowski, who's said the images in question are the same ones hacked and released a view years ago.\nThe We Are Your Friends star also criticized photographer Jonathan Leder last December for releasing Polaroid images from a racy photo-shoot without her consent. She's tweeted: 'To be clear: I signed no release & was not paid.'\nAccessorizing: Ratajkowski, who rocketed to fame prancing about in the controversial music video for Robin Thicke's 2013 single Blurred Lines, toted a snakeskin-patterned purse", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=", "http://www.dailystar.co.uk/showbiz/587758/emily-ratajkowski-hack-helen-wood", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ome6HQFHiQ"], "published": "2017-02-22T00:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T12:33:54.103+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
