He won the maillot jaune for that stage. Over his decade-long career, with 36 professional victories, he wore the maillot six times and the maglia rosa , the equivalent in the Giro d'Italia, 14 times. In 1998 he won both races, only the seventh time in history that the double had been achieved. The secret of his triumphs always lay in his astonishing bursts of speed as soon as the road began to rise and the snowy peaks began to loom above him. \nHe was ideally built for climbing: small, compact and muscular. He started as a teenager, and won his first Baby Giro because of his prowess in the mountains. Soon few could beat him there. Famously, on one ascent, his chain came off; he stopped, replaced it, and went on to win. As his fame spread he basked in Italy's adoration, tying a bandanna round his shaven head and sporting an earring for his races. He was “Il Pirata”, and the legions of fans who lined the roads to watch him and mobbed his hotels, reaching to touch his clothes as if he were a saint, often waved skull-and-crossbones flags. \nThe death image was appropriate, for it could be argued that his passion for mountains destroyed him. His worst crashes always occurred there. In the 1995 Giro a jeep drove into him as he descended the Pino Torinese, shattering his left leg and obliging him to spend five months on crutches. Two years later, a black cat capsized him on the descent to Chiunzi. Last May, riding in what was to be his last Giro, he crashed in the second-to-last Alpine stage. \nThe urge to climb faster and more furiously than anyone else led him, inevitably, towards drugs. Rumours circulated about his uncanny bursts of speed. In hospital in 1995, his blood was found to have suspicious levels of hematocrit, an indicator (though not proof) of the use of performance-enhancing drugs. Four years later, wearing the maglia rosa after winning four mountain stages of the Giro, he failed a random blood test and was thrown out of the race. In 2001, a syringe containing traces of insulin was found in his hotel room; he said it had been planted there. Alone in Rimini \nAlthough Mr Pantani was never definitively found guilty of using drugs, he could not throw off the accusations. His fans did not desert him, but his racing suffered. After he failed to be included in the 2003 centenary Tour de France, he checked into a clinic for the treatment of depression. \nHis death is still a mystery. He died alone in a seaside hotel in Rimini, with ten opened packets of prescription sedatives scattered round the room. He had already told friends that, though he still rode his bike “just to turn my legs”, he was sick of cycling. His thickening, unhealthy body nauseated him. In a note that was read out at his funeral, scrawled over nine pages of his passport, he complained that both his sporting life and his private life had been “violated” by constant allegations and the scrutiny of the authorities. \nSome of his cycling friends thought there was more to it. Although Mr Pantani had been technically part of a team in all his races, his career was a succession of solitary triumphs against the giants of nature. When the American champion Lance Armstrong—condescendingly, Mr Pantani thought—allowed him to win the Mont Ventoux stage of the Tour in 2000, he was so angry that he made Mr Armstrong chase him through the peaks for the next two days. The mountains were his, and he could not bear to see them conquered by anyone else. \nOther champion climbers had felt the same, declining into depression and sometimes suicide once their careers were over. René Pottier, who excelled in the Alps, hanged himself from his own bike-hook in 1907; René Vietto retired in depression to a remote farm in the late 1940s; Thierry Claveyrolat shot himself in 1999. Having won their keenest victories alone, they struggled alone, like Mr Pantani, in the less exalting parts of life. And having been at the peak, literally and metaphorically, they found the coming down too hard.
