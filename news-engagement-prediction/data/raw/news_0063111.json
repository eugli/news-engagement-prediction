In a statement to Axios , an unnamed company spokesman decried Trump's decision to withdraw guidelines covering the use of public school bathrooms by transgender students. The recommendations date back to the Obama administration and urge schools to grant transgender students the right to use bathroom facilities designated for the gender to which they identify. \"Apple believes everyone deserves a chance to thrive in an environment free from stigma and discrimination,\" Apple said. \"We support efforts toward greater acceptance, not less, and we strongly believe that transgender students should be treated as equals. We disagree with any effort to limit or rescind their rights and protections.\" This isn't the first time Apple voiced concern over the transgender bathroom issue. Last July, the company signed an amicus brief supporting the U.S. Justice Department's efforts to halt the enforcement of a North Carolina law that forces people to use bathrooms corresponding to their birth gender. Prior to that, Apple CEO Tim Cook joined dozens of high-profile corporate executives and business leaders in asking then North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory and the state's General Assembly to repeal the bill, known as HB2.
