This year has seen Paris Jackson, the feisty daughter of music legend Michael, emerge as a star to watch, and she continued her ascent today with a trip to tonight’s Grammy Awards in Los Angeles. Arriving in a glittering Balmain look from Olivier Rousteing ’s Spring 2017 collection, the 18-year-old made her red-carpet debut with youthful glamour. Delicately beaded and covered in contrasting earth-tone stripes, the gown immediately stood out from the pack. Rousteing’s designs are known for their overt sexiness, but Jackson and stylist Sonia Young’s choice managed to be fun as well. Unlike other major award shows, the Grammys is known as a place where celebrities can be playful and lighthearted with their fashion choices. Worn with tousled blonde waves, a nose ring, and a reflective War by Michael Bradley clutch, Jackson’s ensemble hit the right note for a guest at the ceremony. As she stepped into the Staples Center with pal Caroline D’Amore, Jackson flashed her best accessory of the evening—a bright smile.
