AP Photo/Aaron Favila, File \nMANILA, Philippines — Communist rebels have announced the termination of a ceasefire with the government citing the failure to release political prisoners and the military's alleged encroachment in rebel territory. \nIn a statement, New People's Army spokesman Jorge \"Ka Oris\" Madlos said that the unilateral ceasefire issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Philippines and the NPA's National Operations Command will expire at 11:59 p.m. on February 10. \nMadlos said that the CPP-NPA had issued the ceasefire on the condition that the release of the political prisoners would happen with 60 days of August 28, the start of talks. \nPresident Rodrigo Duterte, who identifies himself as a socialist, has previously said that he will not release the prisoners and that he has already conceded much to the CPP-NPA-National Democratic Front, which has supporters in the Duterte Cabinet. He said in late 2016, however, that elderly political prisoners would be released. \n\"The Duterte regime failed to fulfill such obligation even though the CPP obliged it by extending the ceasefire declaration to more than 150 days,\" Madlos said. \nDuterte said he would readily release all the political prisoners once the government CPP-NPA-NDF sign a bilateral ceasefire agreement. Headlines   \nThe NPA also said that the government had \"treacherously taken advantage of the unilateral declaration of interim ceasefire to encroach on the territory of the people’s democratic government.\" It said that the military has \"occupied at least 500 barrios which are within the authority of the revolutionary government\" across 43 provinces that the NPA claims to operate in. \nIt said security forces have launched \"hostile actions, provocations or movements, surveillance and other offensive operations\" despite the ceasefire. \n\"On January 21, a firefight broke out as the AFP waged offensive operations against an NPA platoon in Makilala, North Cotabato, resulting in eight soldiers killed. An NPA Red fighter was martyred,\" he also said. \nThe military has acknowledged the clash but not the casualty count. The Palace said then that the clash \"should not affect any of the ongoing talks.\" NPA supports peace process, but fighting to continue \nMadlos said that despite the termination of the ceasefire, the NPA is supportive of the peace process. The peace talks in 2016 were the first between the government and the CPP-NPA-NDF since they bogged down and eventually stopped during President Benigno Aquino III's administration. \n\"In our experience and in the experience of other peoples, it is possible to negotiate while fighting until the substantive agreements are forged to address the roots of the armed conflict and lay the basis for a just and lasting peace,\" he said. \nNPA units have been ordered to go on \"active defense\" until the ceasefire expires. \nOnce it does, Madlos said, the NPA will take full initiative in planning, coordinating and carrying out military campaigns and tactical offensives against the reactionary Armed Forces of the Philippines, the Philippine National Police, the various paramilitary units and death squads of the Duterte government, drug traffickers and operators of the drug trade and large-scale gambling, private armies and private armed groups of warlords, local tyrants as well as spies.\" — Jonathan de Santos Headlines  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T10:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T06:59:54.685+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
