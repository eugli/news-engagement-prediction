Samuelson Tags: Dr. Linus Pauling , Dr. Ronald Hoffman , high doses of vitamin C kills cancer , Intravenous vitamin C , vitamin C \n( Natural News ) Linus Pauling Ph.D. (1901 – 1994) was a scientist’s scientist during a period of history when the primary role of the discipline was a diligent search for truth, not corporate sponsorship. Pauling’s youthful genius and inquisitiveness to discover just how and why atoms form bonds with molecules and create structures guided his entire life. He is considered as “the founding father of modern biochemistry,” a forerunner of today’s investigations in molecular biology. An outspoken scientist and social activist, Pauling is the only man in history to have received two “Nobel Prizes -for Chemistry (1954) and for Peace (1962).” \nPauling authored over 1000 scientific influential papers along with a diverse line up of books. General Chemistry is an internationally used college textbook. The Nature of the Chemical Bond, written in 1931, is still revered as one of the most profound “scientific book[s] in the 20th century.” Pauling was also a dedicated humanitarian and an outspoken activist against nuclear testing, citing the damaging health effects of radioactive fallout on generations to come . He coined the phrase “molecular disease,” and for many years studied human physiology and the biochemistry of nutrition. It was Pauling who championed the efficacy of vitamin C as a vital element to treat the common cold, heart disease, and cancer. The burgeoning pharmaceutical, vaccine, and cancer industries did not approve of Pauling’s scientific prowess. But they were wrong. Pauling was right. \nLife Extension sites epidemiological studies from 1992 that show individuals who take higher levels of vitamin C live longer and have fewer heart attacks “as [compared to] those with fewer levels.” Thedailysheeple.com reports that Iowa researchers have discovered that high levels ascorbic acid (vitamin C) delivered intravenously “increases hydrogen peroxide levels in cancer cells.” This action killed cancer cells in lab rats, but did not harm any other cells. The research mentions that ascorbic acid seemed to work best with pancreatic cancer cells , and the ability for ascorbic acid to be effective in other types of cancer cells, such as breast, brain, liver, lung, and skin, depend on “the measurement of catalyse activity in tumors.” Catalyse is an enzyme that plays a significant role in breaking up the bonds of hydrogen peroxide. \nLinus Pauling and his team administered mega doses of vitamin C intravenously to 1000 cancer patients, reports Thetruthaboutcancer.com, and, although they were ridiculed, they discovered that patients receiving their vitamin C protocol “lived four times longer than cancer patients who were not given vitamin C.” \nDr. Ronald Hoffman is the director of the Hoffman Center in New York City. He concludes that oral vitamin C will help your body’s immune system and repair mechanism, but the ability for it to be absorbed by the blood “maxes out at 500 milligrams.” For cancer treatment, Hoffman believes vitamin C must be given intravenously “to spur the production of hydrogen peroxide” in areas of the body where cancer may be lurking. He states: “IV vitamin C, when administered by a trained, experienced physician, is safe and well-tolerated, even at doses as high as 100,000 mg (100 grams) per day.” \nThe force of the pharmaceutical and cancer industries to keep you away from nutritional therapies has not abated. There are still internet references to the brilliant Dr. Linus A. Pauling as a “quack.” But Pauling, unlike today’s corporately controlled scientists, searched for the truth. He found it. And now, finally, mainstream scientists are merely catching up to his tremendous insights and discoveries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T16:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T02:22:54.603+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
