You don’t even know how much it’s burning.” \nHosts Julia Morris and Chris Brown attempted to calm Maguire down as she sat hysterically crying and screaming at production staff. \n“They are not on national TV like dying,” she said when Morris told her the trial had been tested several times previously. \nKRIS SMITH’S BEEF WITH HIS CAMPMATES Keira Maguire breaks down on I’m A Celebrity ...

That was so bad, worse than any treatment I’ve ever had on my face and that is f**king painful.” \nMaguire’s meltdown started from the minute she took on the trial. Sticking her head into a perspex box of rats, she recoiled into the bushes sobbing. Later, it was a box of chillies and chilli sauce that broke her. \nAFL legend Dane Swan stood quietly with red welts on his neck and face after being bitten by thousands of ants including on his lip and inside his nose. \n“No one even cared. Is this really what it is going to be like the whole time?” she yelled, Swan responding: “pretty much”. \nNetwork Ten head of entertainment and factual programming Stephen Tate said: “We had already tested this trial several times. The chilli sauce is commercially available here in South Africa in the supermarket. While it was very unpleasant it was also totally harmless to Keira’s health.” Keira Maguire to crash I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here 0:46 \nEx-Bachelor contestant Keira Maguire has announced she is an I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here intruder.

You’ll get the message from me pretty quickly if you come back and there’s nothing in your pocket.” \nAsh Pollard, of My Kitchen Rules and Dancing with the Stars fame, said: “she gets paparazzied a lot and I think that is her tipping off the paps because nobody gets paparazzied that much from a reality show.” \n** The journalist is in South Africa as a guest of Channel Ten.
