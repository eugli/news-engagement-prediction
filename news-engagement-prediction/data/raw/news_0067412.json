Buddy Hield, the centerpiece of the trade with New Orleans, scored 16 points in his Kings debut. \nThe most memorable moment from the game, though, was a veteran trick by point guard Ty Lawson. \nThe former North Carolina Tar Heel did a long-standing basketball trick and had it work better than it probably has. \nAbout 15 years ago, basketball guards at all levels started not grabbing the inbounds pass right away, especially in low-clock situations, so the clock would not start until it is touched. \nAs a defender, all you have to do is give enough of an effort toward getting close to the guard to make them pick it up as soon as possible. \nThis example is a bit of the opposite of that, but still clever. \nAfter a made basket by the Nuggets with 2:39 to play, Lawson let the ball roll toward halftime. After the made basket, the game clock was moving, but the shot clock did not start until Lawson picked it up. \nThe most surprising part of the story is that the closest defender was Denver veteran Jameer Nelson. \nAs Nelson stood by watching, Lawson was able to milk 15 seconds off the clock before the possession even started. Nelson then fouled right away, proving that every second mattered to the Nuggets, who were trailing by 15 points. \nIt looks like the Kings have some tricks up their sleeves for the stretch run. \nMaybe we shouldn't cross them off the playoff contender list quite yet.
