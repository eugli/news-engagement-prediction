Inspite of winning acclaim for its innovative storyline and powerful powerful performances, the show failed to garner subsequent ratings. \nHeance, the makers have decided to go for a leap, with an aim to improve the ratings of the show. The entire show's focus is now on Arsheen Namdaar, who plays the role of fiesty Avni. The little girl is garnering rave reviews for her superb performance. \nIf reports are to be believed, popular actress Sonal Vengurlekar has been finalised to reprise the role of Avni. Yes, the talented actress who was last seen in Yeh Vaada Raha will be playing the grown-up Avni in the show. \nNot only that, it is also being said that a few old faces will bid adieu to the show and new ones will enter the show. Also joining Sonal would be Nalini Negi, who play the role of grown-up Riya. \nActors Reema Lagoo, Viraf Patel and Sayantani Ghosh will make their presence felt, post the leap as well, but the fate of other actors remains unknown and the makers are yet to take a call regarding this. \nCurrently, Avni, Aladin and Neela have joined hands to expose Dayavanti. Will the trio be successful? Stay tuned to know...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T12:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T17:40:04.305+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
