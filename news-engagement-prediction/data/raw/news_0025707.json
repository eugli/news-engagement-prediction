However, many watching at home were just as obsessed with the sparkling band on her ring finger, adding fuel to the rumors that she secretly got engaged to -- or even married -- her boyfriend, Simon Konecki. But we were mostly fascinated about how well she hit her high notes. Twenty One Pilots Strip Down to Their Underwear, Corden Responds \nvia GIPHY When Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun won Best Pop Duo/Group, the two artists stripped off their tuxedo pants and accepted the award in their skivvies. While the stunt seemed silly at first, it turned out there was a meaningful reason behind it all. Joseph recounted how, years before they \"were able to make any money playing music,\" he invited Dun over to his house to watch the GRAMMYs, and \"as we were watching, we noticed that every single one of us was in our underwear. Josh turned to me, and we were no one at the time, and he said, 'If we ever win a GRAMMY, we should receive it just like this. So, not only is this amazing but I want everyone watching at home to know that you could be next. Anyone from anywhere can do anything.\" Beyonce's Psychedelic Live/Holographic Performance \nvia GIPHY The Lemonade singer, who is pregnant with twins, delivered one of the highlight performances of the night that ended up being more like art than your standard live GRAMMYs fare. Combining holograms and pre-recorded packages with a live stage presence, the trippy Golden Goddess experiment was unlike anything we've seen from her (or the awards show) in the past. \nvia GIPHY Perry delivered the debut live performance of her new single, \"Chained to the Rhythm,\" along with collaborator Skip Marley. While the song would have been fun to watch on it's own merit, Perry made sure to inject some bold political commentary . Aside from rocking a \"PERSIST\" arm band and a Planned Parenthood pin on her lapel, the duo ended the song by standing in front of a massive projection of the preamble to the Constitution. Bruno Mars Channels Prince \nvia GIPHY In a tribute to the late star, Mars' proved his love for Prince's legacy with an amazing rendition of the legend's 1984 single, \"Let's Go Crazy,\" while decked out just like music icon, rocking a glittery purple suit, complete with a white ascot. Mars showed just how talented he really is while covering the iconic song. Not only did he nail Prince's vocal range, he shredded on the guitar in a performance that blew most other Prince tributes out of the water. BEST MOMENT OF THE NIGHT Adele Wins Album of the Year, Tries to Give It to Beyonce \nvia GIPHY To say Adele had a big night would be a laughable understatement. She opened the show, she performed the tribute to George Michael and she became the only artist to win Song of the Year, Record of the Year and Album of the year at the same show, twice! Her tearful acceptance speech for Album of the Year was a non-stop highlight reel. For example, she seemingly confirmed that she had indeed tied the knot with her longtime boyfriend while opening up about being a mom, when she referred to Simon Konecki as her \"husband.\" However, her best moment might have come when she openly wept and said that, while she appreciated the honor, she felt wrong winning it over Beyonce. \"I can't   award. I'm very humbled and very grateful and gracious but [the]   Beyonce,\" Adele said through tears as Beyonce looked up at her from the audience. \"The Lemonade album is just so monumental   beautiful. We   don't   appreciate that. All us artists here appreciate you.\" \"I love you,\" Adele said. \"I always have and I always will.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T13:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T08:34:38.573+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
