The 27-year-old is from the United Arab Emirates and is shattering preconceptions of what a hockey player looks like.\nAl Ali picked up a hockey stick for the first just six years ago, but her puck-handling skills have already earned her a spot on the UAE’s women’s national team. In November, those skills caught the eye of former Washington Capitals star Peter Bondra.\nPETER BONDRA , Former NHL Player: I played the game professionally for 23 years. And if I tried to do the stuff which she does, I have to learn, and I’m not sure exactly how it be accomplished, just to be honest.\nJULIA GRIFFIN: Bondra was so impressed by Al Ali’s abilities that he posted a video to Twitter, saying, “She has better hands than me.”\nThat video went viral, and a few weeks later, he surprised Al Ali with a dream trip to meet the Caps. Coincidentally, that’s her favorite NHL team.\nPETER BONDRA: February is a month for of Hockey for Everyone.

And she wasted no time sliding into drills and scoring goals.\nAl Ali’s idol, Caps captain Alex Ovechkin, praised her talent.\nALEX OVECHKIN , Washington Capitals: She’s going to be famous and she’s going to be a star.\nJULIA GRIFFIN: But Al Ali doesn’t just impress male counterparts here in the U.S. She also holds her own back home as a men’s games referee.\nFATIMA AL ALI: I had two fights before coming here. The first one ended up bad. I got punched in the face with, but I kept — I finished the game. And then the second fight, they told me how to break the fight, so I was just pulling them from their pants.\nJULIA GRIFFIN: No matter what side of the puck she is on, Al Ali hopes she can be a role model.\nFATIMA AL ALI: I hope that I can inspire enough people, or at least women. Have a dream, just go make it come true.\nJULIA GRIFFIN: Fitting advice for pursuing goals from a woman who excels at scoring them.\nFor the PBS NewsHour, I’m Julia Griffin in Washington, D.C.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And an inspiration for a lot of little girls looking at hockey.\nOn the NewsHour online right now, we take a look inside the secret process that’s supposed to prevent mishaps at the Academy Awards like the one that occurred last night over the best picture award.\nWe also have a trove of conversations with the filmmakers and artists behind the award season’s most acclaimed movies.
