Read more Most Europeans want immigration ban from Muslim-majority countries \nThey found “strong and stable evidence” that crime rates are not linked to immigration, said the study’s lead author Robert Adelman, adding: “The results are very clear.” \nHigher levels of immigration are in fact related to a drop in some types of crime, they discovered. \n“The results show that immigration does not increase assaults and, in fact, robberies, burglaries, larceny, and murder are lower in places where immigration levels are higher,” said Dr Adelman, an Associate Professor of Sociology at the university. \nAn executive order signed by Mr Trump on the fifth day of his presidency includes a clause requiring the Secretary of Homeland Security to “on a weekly basis, make public a comprehensive list of criminal actions committed by aliens”.

Donald Trump to publish weekly list of crimes committed by immigrants \nAnd Frank Sharry, executive director of campaign group America’s Voice, which is against restrictive immigration laws, told Fox News the President had announced the policy because he “wants the American people to think that most undocumented immigrants are criminals”. \n“Every expert knows the opposite is true, but he wants to spread the ‘Big Lie’ to justify what he intends to do – which is to try to force millions of immigrants out of the country,” he said. \nPrevious research has shown that people born overseas are less likely to commit crimes than those born in the US. Donald Trump says a 'bad high school student' could understand his powers for the immigration ban \nFigures from the US Justice Department analysed by the Cato Institute think tank found immigrants were one-half to one-fifth as likely to be jailed when compared with American citizens. \nAround seven per cent of the country’s population are non-citizens, while five per cent of prisoners in state and federal prisons fall into that category. \nThe new study, published in the Journal of Ethnicity in Criminal Justice , used a large, far-reaching dataset in an attempt to explore wider societal trends related to immigration patterns, said Dr Adelman. Right-wing vlogger Tomi Lahren calls refugees ‘rapeugees’ \n“We are not claiming that immigrants are never involved in crime. What we are explaining is that communities experiencing demographic change driven by immigration patterns do not experience significant increases in any of the kinds of crime we examined,” he said. \n“It's important to base our public policies on facts and evidence rather than ideologies and baseless claims that demonise particular segments of the US population without any facts to back them up.” \nMr Trump has promised to build a wall at the border between the US and Mexico and has pledged to deport as many as three million illegal immigrants, substantially broadening the remit of the Department of Homeland Security to include those with minor convictions as well as those known to have committed serious crimes.
