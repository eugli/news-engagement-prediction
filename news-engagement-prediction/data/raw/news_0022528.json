The 41-year-old actress stopped by Late Night With Seth Myers on Thursday and shared a hilarious story of how she handled her daughter, Oliveâ€™s, major tantrum during a recent trip to Disneyland. \"If you've ever taken your kid to Disneyland or Disney World, it all ends at some point in mayhem,\" Barrymore said, before showing the audience photos of her 4-year-old daughter laying on the ground. \"That is a legitimate picture of my daughter just losing it on the floor,\" she said. Barrymore then shared a second photo of Olive, where she's once again laying on the ground. \"This is her losing it at Disneyland -- because it all ends up there,\" she explained. \"You push it enough, because you're like, 'I'm here! Let's skip the nap! Let's go, go, go!' You want to maximize it. This is how it always ends for me.\" Meyers, who has a 10-month-old son, Ashe, with wife Alexi Meyers, admired Barrymore's attitude. \"I like your approach, which is a photo op,\" he joked. ET caught up with Barrymore last week, where she talked about her new Netflix show, Santa Clarita Diet. Watch the video below to find out why she fell in love her character.
