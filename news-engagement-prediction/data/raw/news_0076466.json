Image source: Twitter video screen cap \nThe 16-second video, posted to Twitter on Saturday morning, shows one of the females moving from her hands and knees to actually standing atop the hood while twerking.

Ciminelli on Monday told TheBlaze in a statement that the result of the video is ‚Äúan inappropriate and unacceptable image for the Rochester Police Department‚Äù and that the issue has been ‚Äúaddressed.‚Äù \nThe women approached the officers and asked if they could take a photo of themselves with the police car, Ciminelli said, adding that it‚Äôs a ‚Äúfairly common occurrence and we generally let people do this.‚Äù So the officers stepped away from the cruiser and ‚Äúwithout notice or warning, one of the women jumped on the police car,‚Äù the chief said. \nCiminelli added that the officers were ‚Äúsurprised‚Äù and ‚Äúgiven the short duration of time the woman was on the car (estimated at 3-4 seconds) they did not have an opportunity to react.‚Äù \nAfterward the officers checked and confirmed there was no damage to the police car, the chief said, adding that the ‚Äúsupervisor then talked to the women and told them that what they did was not acceptable. The girls apologized and thanked the officers.‚Äù \nThe twerking incident didn‚Äôt go down well with Bob Lonsberry, who hosts a morning radio talk show for Rochester station WHAM-AM. \nLonsberry said the Rochester police force has become a ‚Äúdepartment of passivity so intent on respecting ‚Äòthe community‚Äô that it has none for itself‚Äù ‚Äî and blamed Mayor Lovely A. Warren and her ‚Äúcompliant‚Äù police chief for that. \nHe added that the video is evidence of the department‚Äôs state and that Rochester police have been ‚Äúcastrated by three years of WTF leadership.‚Äù \nMore from Lonsberry: \nAnd just yesterday, a fleeing 16-year-old ‚Äî a product of the piss-on-the-cops era ‚Äî popped off a couple of rounds at a Rochester officer who was chasing him. \nHe missed. \nBut they don‚Äôt always miss. \nThe luck doesn‚Äôt always hold. \nTheBlaze on Monday spoke to a Rochester city media relations official who said the mayor‚Äôs office was deferring the matter to Rochester police.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T22:06:17.454+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
