In pictures: The fire at Church of Ascension Church destroyed in huge fire had recently undergone £250,000 refurbishment \nCCTV footage of a male they want to trace in connection with the incident has now been released. \nIt shows a man, possibly a teenage boy, running away from the church grounds around the time of the fire, police said. \nDetective Sergeant Karl Dalton, of GMP’s Salford Borough, described the attack as ‘reckless’ and says it’s lucky no-one was hurt. (Photo: Joel Goodman) \nHe said: “We have a team of detectives investigating the circumstances surrounding this large-scale fire which has completely devastated a building at the heart of the community. \n“The reckless actions of the person, or people, responsible have caused a great deal of stress and anxiety to many and it is fortunate that no one was injured. \n“I am appealing to the public to carefully watch the CCTV footage to see if you can help us identity the person who can be seen leaving the church grounds around the time the fire started. We also need to hear from any witnesses to the incident or anyone who believes they have any information.” Watch: Firefighters battle fire in Salford Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T00:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T20:06:42.844+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
