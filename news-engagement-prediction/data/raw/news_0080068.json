Credit: Met Police A burglar has been found guilty of an almost £1 million raid on Simon Cowell's home as he and his family slept.\nDarren February broke into the five-bed property in Holland Park, west London, through a patio door - while Cowell's security guard used the toilet.\nHe made off with jewellery and two passports.\nJust 10 days after he burgled Cowell's home in December last year, February hit 52-year-old father and motorcyclist Kenneth Baldwin with a car and killed him.\nThe 33-year-old was jailed last year for eight-and-a-half years for causing death by dangerous driving not far from Cowell's home.\nSimon Cowell February had already been convicted of 37 burglaries, repeatedly targeting the wealthy areas of Kensington and Bayswater.\nWhen he broke into Cowell's house he was on licence for other burglaries and public order offences.\nHe has committed 58 offences spanning two decades, and was first convicted aged just 12.\nFebruary shook his head in disagreement as the verdict was returned. His DNA was found on gloves dropped on his escape from the scene, and on a handprint on a wall at the property, where Cowell has lived for 10 years.\nAmong the items taken were a ring estimated to be worth half a million pounds, earrings, watches and a diamond bracelet.\nI wish to say that no-one has the right or authority to steal from Lauren or myself.\nOne of the stolen passports was dropped nearby and recovered that morning, while another was found at a recycling facility in Wandsworth and handed to police. Some of the jewellery was recovered at the scene but it is understood most of it was not returned.\nFebruary will be sentenced at the same court on Wednesday morning.\n– Simon Cowell One of the stolen passports was dropped nearby and recovered that morning, while another was found at a recycling facility in Wandsworth and handed to police.\nSome of the jewellery was recovered at the scene but it is understood most of it was not returned.\nFebruary will be sentenced on Wednesday morning.\nLast updated Tue 28 Feb 2017 London", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T01:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T08:27:29.881+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
