Jaymes was hospitalized after a car crash in last week's episode, and ultimately didn't survive the trauma. \nNot long after her character's onscreen death, Britton shared a note to the show's fans on social media , expressing gratitude for the role, her castmates, crew and Nashville 's devoted fans. \n\"It has been an honor to be a part of that creation,\" she wrote. \"And as I know (Rayna) would want it, the show must, and will go on. Long live Rayna Jaymes.\" \nAnd \"Nashville,\" indeed, plays on. The show isn't even halfway finished with its current 22-episode season. Variety reports Britton will appear in the next two episodes, \"which will include a funeral and will showcase a series of flashbacks.\" The outlet also says Britton is already \"courting many pilot offers from the major broadcast networks, but has yet to sign on to a new project.\" A post shared by connie britton (@conniebritton) on Feb 23, 2017 at 7:04pm PST Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2lDgI8T NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.
