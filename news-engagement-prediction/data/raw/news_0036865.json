Are they really faceless? El-Rufai knows many of them because he pays some monthly or at least by his own admission periodically. \nNigeria has become the BEST country in the world to be an Islamic terrorist. Why? No body ever investigates you and your family…and no body investigates the sponsors. We just report the incident and wait for the next one to happen. The men and women who do it are simpy called “Suicide Bombers”. Nigeria is a hell on earth! NAME of Suicide Bombers pls! \n” Civilian-JTF operatives said few hours after the Muna explosions, soldiers at Muna Dalti, a location about 1 kilometre away from the first explosion, shot six suicide bombers who were attempting to sneak into town at about 2 a.m. Some Boko Haram gunmen who were riding on motorcycles accompanied the six suicide bombers, they said.” \nQUESTION 1. How did the Soldiers know that the 6 persons were suicide bombers? 2. Why were they not demobilized so they can be quizzed? 3. Since they are all dead, why not NAME them? Who are they? Who are their parents, brothers, friends etc? \nThis is becoming more of comedy. How can a news medium even report a story like this as though it were simple tales? Omooba Adekunle Orafidiya \nBoko Haram has truly been defeated by certificate forger and perjurer Muhammadu (alias Customs and Exercise and President Michelle of Western Germany) Buhari!!! Yeye dey smell. Papa Ogihwriodo \nPlease who are the people called ‘suicide bombers’? I have not heard that name before here in Warri. When their mothers born them, did their mothers born them for only one man called‘Mr. Bombers’? So that the surname of all these people throwing bomb is the same name. Even if that is the case, how come all these people also bear the same first name as ‘Suicide’? \nThe federal government must look into this issue. If only one family of Mr. Bombers is the cause of bomb every day why not go and arrest the man? That is the best way to capture all his children. How can only one family be so difficult for Nigeria Army to fight, only one family of Mr. Bombers and his children all of them called ‘suicide’? Just go to Maternity Birth registry first. Look for how many people were born by Mr. Bombers since the people throwing bombs have no real name and no other name when they were born. In the registry you will see the address too and the names of all the women that born children for the Mr. Bombers. George \nMaybe this is the reason yeye El rufai ran out of Nigeria yesterday through MMIA. I saw him with four men following the normal passagers route instead of the VIP even the Mallams immigrations that has took over the Lagos Airport even disappointed seeing this nomadic short paint seize following the passagers route instead of the VIP route as usual. \nI learned he is going to London to counter Saraki visit to the half dead president bokohari Zoologist", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T18:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T14:13:09.319+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
