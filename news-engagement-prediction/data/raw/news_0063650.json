Kangana Ranaut's Rangoon is important for getting her back in the box office game and our trade expert Akshaye Rathi explains why... By Karan Shah | Published: February 24, 2017 11:25 am Shahid Kapoor and Saif Ali Khan bonding with each other is a sight never seen before – check out pic \nKangana Ranaut has tremendous talent and she has shown off her acting skills in various films including Queen and Tanu Weds Manu Returns . The way she portrays characters on the silver screen is truly inspiring. However, even though she is a huge name in Bollywood, the actress has had a mixed run at the box office in the past couple of years. In fact, since Queen , she has recorded just two HUGE hits out of the six releases she has had. This is alarming coz of the fact that Bollywood runs in a day and age where box office numbers are way more important than anything else. \nTalking about her run at the box office, our trade expert Akshaye Rathi (exhibitor and distributor) mentioned to us exclusively, “She has had a couple of ordinary outings at the box office recently including Katti Batti , Revolver Rani and Rajjo . And barring Queen , Tanu Weds Manu and Tanu Weds Manu Returns ; Kangana Ranaut has nothing to boast about after Gangster . So that’s really a bit sad. So Rangoon is actually a film that needs to deliver at the box office.” \nIf you look at the box office figures, Queen and Tanu Weds Manu Returns are the only films that have raked in a large amount of moolah over the past couple of years. She has had only one Rs 100 crore in the last six releases, while her contemporaries are raking in Rs 100 crore films every year. But we would like to add that in the films that haven’t worked at the box office, Kangana has performed brilliantly, but the script or the storyline has let her down at the box office. Check out the box office collections of all her releases since Queen right here: \nBut with Rangoon having a good buzz before its release, we expect it to perform well. A stellar and popular cast including Shahid Kapoor , Saif Ali Khan and Kangana will also help Rangoon as people will flock to the theatres to watch the movie. The story also looks interesting, so things are looking bright for Kangana and her momentum of getting back in the box office race… \nHow excited are you to see Kangana Ranaut’s Rangoon ?
