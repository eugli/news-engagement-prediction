Instead, they utilized those skills in the halfcourt set, patiently limiting possessions in the game, and finding A'Ja Wilson for tough shots in traffic and early threes from Kaela Davis, Allisha Gray and Bianca Cuevas-Moore. \nLate in the first half, South Carolina was shooting 50 percent from the field, something only one other Connecticut opponent had accomplished all season. Huskies leading scorer Katie Lou Samuelson was 0-for-7 from the field. And still, in a best-case scenario for the Gamecocks, they only led 29-28 and then trailed, when Collier buried a three. \nBy halftime, Connecticut led, 35-29 on a Collier transition layup, and Williams had a virtual double-double, 16 points and nine rebounds, a full night's work in half a game. Connecticut never trailed again. \nThat mini-run echoed a similar point in the last game Connecticut was challenged back in December at Maryland, reflecting a new reality for the Huskies. This is not the Breanna Stewart-Moriah Jefferson era Connecticut, a team last year that strung together nothing but runs. That team beat a Mississippi State team that's lost only once this season, 98-38. They faced an Oregon State team that featured three current or future WNBA players in the Final Four and crushed them, 80-51. They destroyed a Syracuse team in the final, 82-51. \nWhat these Huskies do is find that form, in significant, extended moments, just enough to assert dominance over any opponent, even now. Even a team like South Carolina, with a pair of future lottery picks inside in Wilson and Alaina Coates. Even with Kia Nurse, the team's best perimeter defender, hampered by an ankle injury that sent her to the locker room midway through the second quarter. It didn't matter. The muscle memory is too strong by now. \nAnd so, Samuelson curled around a screen and finally sank her first shot in the third quarter, after eight misses. After forcing a Gamecock miss, Samuelson ran the break and fed Saniya Chong for a layup through contact, leading to the three-point play. \nWilliams, meanwhile, the Connecticut assist leader, scored a career-high 26 points. One reason this Connecticut team has greatly outperformed the regressing form expected of them this year is the chasm between what a 5-foot-11 interior player is supposed to be, and the Kawhi Leonard-level season Williams is having. And there's Collier, second in the country in true shooting percentage, finishing a three-point play to end the third quarter, extending the Connecticut lead to double digits and ending the suspense. \nOnce again, Connecticut is not only the most efficient offense in the country, but entered the night second to Baylor in defensive efficiency as well. And so that South Carolina offense spun its wheels, stuck in the 40s well into the fourth quarter. Wilson went scoreless for much of the second half. \nSo much went right for South Carolina. But not enough. It's never enough to beat Connecticut anymore. 100 and counting, and nobody thinks it will end anytime soon.
