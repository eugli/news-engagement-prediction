SCREENGRAB \nThe girl's seat belt broke and she was flung from the ride. \nThe parents have agreed on 870,000 yuan ($172,992) in compensation with the park for the death of their only child, the Chengdu-based paper reported. \nThe ride was inspected and found fit for use in December, the report said, although the relevant website indicated the last check-up as having taken place in 2013. \nChina's national safety authority has ordered all fun parks with the ride to suspend its operation until further checks have been made with the Chengdu-based company that manufactures it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T08:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T03:50:41.345+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
