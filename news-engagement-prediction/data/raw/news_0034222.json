Trump — the new President continues to undo the Obama Legacy piece by piece , fulfilling some big time campaign promises in the process. \nYesterday it was ringing the death knell for ObamaCare’s individual mandate. Today it was reversing Obama’s extremist ban on coal mining . \nIn May 2016 , Trump went to West Virginia and promised to reverse Obama’s disastrous, job-killing edicts to halt coal mining, after Hillary Clinton promised to kill all coal mining jobs and put thousands of families out of work. \nToday President Trump signed legislation today rescuing coal miners and the coal industry from extremist liberal regulations. \nSeveral coal miners were in the room today as Trump kept his promise , after just 27 days in office. With some coal miners looking on, Pres Trump signs bill repealing Obama Admin regulation protecting streams from mining debris. pic.twitter.com/HmpL1crtrQ \nThe Hill reports : \nOn Thursday Trump signed legislation ending a key Obama administration coal mining rule. \nThe rule is among the most controversial environment regulations the former administration put together. The coal mining industry said it would be costly to implement and lead to job losses across the sector, which is already suffering from a market-driven downturn in demand for its product. \nThe legislation is the second Trump has signed into law ending an Obama-era environmental regulation. On Tuesday, he signed a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution undoing a financial disclosure requirement for energy companies. \nAt the signing, Trump called the regulation “another terrible job killing rule” and said ending it would save “many thousands American jobs , especially in the mines, which, I have been promising you — the mines are a big deal.”“ This is a major threat to your jobs and we’re going to get rid of this threat ,” he added. “ We’re going to fight for you. “ \nDuring the event President Trump actually asked a coal miner to say a few words . The miner from West Virginia was very happy.
