Baosteel did not respond to a request for comment. \n\nThe negotiations come as Pakistani business sentiment turns, with companies betting that Beijing's splurge on road, rail and energy infrastructure under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) will boost the economy. \n\nThe Chinese charge is in contrast to Western investors, who have largely avoided Pakistan in recent years despite fewer militant attacks and economic growth near 5 per cent. \n\nIt is welcomed by many in Pakistan: foreign direct investment was $1.9 billion in 2015/2016, far below the 2007/2008 peak of $5.4 billion. \n\nAt the stock exchange signing ceremony, Sun Weidong, China's ambassador to Pakistan, said the deal \"embodies the ongoing financial integration\" between Chinese and Pakistani markets. \n\n\"This will facilitate more financial support for our enterprises,\" Sun said. \n\nRESERVATIONS \nCPEC will connect China's Western region with Pakistan's Arabian Sea port of Gwadar through a network of rail, road and pipeline projects. \n\nThat will be funded by loans from China, and much of the business will go to Chinese enterprises. \n\nThe scale of Chinese corporate interest beyond that is difficult to gauge, but in Karachi, Pakistan's financial centre, sharply-dressed Chinese appear to outnumber Westerners in hotels, restaurants and the city's airport. \n\nRising skyscrapers testify to a construction boom in the city, businesses are printing Chinese-language brochures and salaries demanded by Pakistanis who speak Chinese have shot up. \n\nMiftah Ismail, chairman of Pakistan's Board of Investment, said Chinese companies were interested in investing in the telecoms and auto sectors, with FAW Group and Foton Motor Group planning to enter Pakistan. \n\nFAW said the Pakistan \"project is going through internal approvals\", but did not offer more details. Foton declined to comment. \n\nBut not everyone is excited by China's growing role in the Pakistan economy, including trade unions, who said Chinese companies' alleged mistreatment of local workers in Africa in the past had alarmed them. \n\n\"We have concern and reservations that the Chinese might use the same methods in Pakistan,\" said Nasir Mansoor, deputy general secretary of National Trade Union Federation, Pakistan, the national trade union body. \n\nThe Chinese government and Chinese companies have dismissed such accusations in the past. \n\nAnd doing business may not be easy for newcomers. Security remains a concern despite a drop in Islamist militant violence, and in the World Bank's ease of doing business index, Pakistan ranks 144 out of 190 countries. \n\nNEXT PHASE \nThe Chinese interest comes as Islamabad and Beijing discuss the next phase of CPEC: how to build Pakistan's industry with the help of Chinese state-owned industrial giants. \n\nPakistani officials are drafting plans for special economic zones which would offer tax breaks and other benefits to Chinese businesses. \n\nBut even before zones are established, Chinese investors are scoping out land deals. \n\n\"A lot of companies ... don't care about CPEC. They just want 500 acres of land to set up shop,\" said Naheed Memon, head of the Sindh province's Board of Investment. \n\nFaisal Aftab, manager of private investment firm Oxon Partners, said Oxon was in talks with two state-run Chinese companies and a wealthy Chinese businessman to purchase and develop land for high-end residential and commercial properties. \n\n\"They are seeking land in prime markets such as Lahore, Karachi, and Islamabad,\" Aftab said. \n\nYunus Brothers' Tabba urged Western investors to overcome their \"phobia\" of Pakistan. \n\n\"If they came here, they would see the momentum, the buzz of growth.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T19:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T09:22:37.056+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
