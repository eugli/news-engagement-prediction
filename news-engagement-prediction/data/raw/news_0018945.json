Photo: Alex Ellinghausen \nImproved company earnings have been driven more by cost cutting than by increasing the revenue numbers â€“ that would only have occurred with significant business investment and the tax system has encouraged profit distribution, rather than reinvestment. We have a globally significant superannuation and funds management industry that is fundamentally conservative, just basically hugging the various stock market indices. \nMany of our key domestic markets are uncompetitive, where a mere handful can exploit their market power in such areas as supermarkets, power, finance and communications. \nSignificant, and increasing, labour \"on costs\", and other labour market rigidities especially in relation to hiring and firing practices, have also discriminated against employment, and there are many, many inconsistencies in wage and salary structures and relativities. \nMany had hoped that the new technology-based economy would be a significant employment generator, but the reverse has been the case, especially with artificial intelligence and the likes of driverless vehicles and other \"Uber moments\" quickly gaining momentum. Software and systems rather than people. \nOur traditional manufacturing sector has had to recognise the realities of globalisation, specifically the significance of our uncompetitive cost base (in a recent survey we ranked as the most uncompetitive of the top 25 exporting manufacturers) and small market disadvantages. This has required another transition from large-scale, volume-based manufacturing to more specialised, \"brain/brand\" based production. \nPower costs have also been a significant recent constraint on many traditional employers, as rising electricity and gas prices due, in many respects, to ill-conceived policies have clouded the sustainability of industries such as glass, paper, and steel manufacturing, mining and smelting operations, and so on. \nAnd there are a host of other factors, such as housing affordability, failing transport and other infrastructure, inadequate childcare and other support services, and inadequate education and training, that too restrain employment opportunities. \nThe only hope is to seek to reverse many of these trends and structural constraints, with a broad-based reform agenda. Opportunistic populism will only compound the difficulties. For example, Trump-style \"anti-ism\" and protectionist policies won't restore jobs to the US rust-belt states, where technology and robots are the main reason for their demise, not \"unfair\" global competition. \nIt is grossly irresponsible of Turnbull and Shorten to continue to raise expectations of job creation and security when they are doing very little to deliver. \nAre we in danger of moving on to a world where government will need to ensure a living wage to many who may never work? \nJohn Hewson is a professor at the Crawford School of Public Policy, ANU, and a former Liberal opposition leader.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T09:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T04:30:31.305+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
