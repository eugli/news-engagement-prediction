Hide Caption (CNN) Fancy an afternoon tea while in the British capital? There's no better place to try this English tradition than in London, which serves up some of the world's most well-regarded versions. Reputedly spawned when an English duchess made a simple request for cake and tea before dinner time in the mid-1800's, afternoon tea has since become a more decadent occasion. Plush baked scones, assorted finger sandwiches and desserts with a generous pot of tea is now the modern standard. While London's traditional luxury offerings could easily monopolize this list, we've included quirky, novel options for those seeking teas with a twist, including one set on a vintage double-decker bus and a fanciful version inspired by Alice in Wonderland. Read More Fortnum & Mason No one knows tea like Fortnum & Mason , London's premier tea and assorted goods emporium since 1707. Visitors can sample their famous teas and much more in the airy, elegant Diamond Jubilee Tea Salon, which is often filled with music from a live pianist. \"Walking into the tea room felt as if I was walking onto a set for a BBC series set in the 19th Century,\" says That Adventurer blogger Hannah Kacary. Tea sommeliers ask guests for taste preferences and recommend the perfect sip from an extensive menu. Also on hand are traditional sommeliers who assist in champagne pairings. Save room for dessert, however. Fortnum's signature cake cart allows guests to choose a slice from a range of choices.

Tea comes with finger sandwiches, such as the the addictive comte cheese panini, warm scones and sweets such as cassis cheesecake and citrus meringue. For full-on eccentricity, there's the Sketch Exotic Tea, where the staff will strain Sketch's own brand of Champagne over chai, vanilla or Earl Grey tea leaves over ice. Best for: Avant-garde tea Sketch , 9 Conduit St, Mayfair, London; +44 20 7659 4500 The Goring It's no surprise that The Goring 's afternoon tea is a classic, regal affair, given that the hotel's been a favorite of the Queen for decades (it's just two blocks away from Buckingham Palace). Tea takes place in a lounge with gilded ceilings, velvety red walls and a crackling fireplace, and the selection of cut sandwiches and sweets -- salmon sandwiches with creme fraiche, strawberry-pistachio macarons and mini banana cake loaves -- change regularly. Those wanting a premium experience should opt for the Afternoon Tea with Bollinger Rose Champagne, which comes with a plate of fresh-cut strawberries and cream in addition to all the fixings.

Save for the round of savory nibbles, no element of this tea goes untouched without dashes of whimsy -- from the five \"Alice\" character-inspired tea selections to macaroons guised as animated pocket watches. \"The menu is hidden inside an old vintage book, teapots come complete with crowns... we tumbled down the rabbit hole and didn't want to return to reality,\" says Crummbs blogger Stacey Smith. Those wanting their fantasy tea a bit more grownup can opt for the Mad Hatter's Tipsy Evening Tea, which includes four cocktail flights and boozy cake bites.

Tour the top sights of London -- including Big Ben, Buckingham Palace and Piccadilly Circus -- while enjoying an afternoon tea spread on a 1960s double-decker Routemaster. \"[It's] an enjoyable idea for both tourists and Londoners who want to see their city differently -- I'd definitely recommend spending a sunny afternoon aboard,\" says Mini Adventures blogger Milly Youngman. The 90-minute tea-tour departs from Victoria or Trafalgar Square and provides scones, sandwiches, cupcakes and French sweets, in addition to live or recorded tour commentary.

The tea menu is kept short and sweet with seven loose leaf selections, and sandwiches are replaced with an assortment of mini-brioches such as Parma ham with mascarpone and avocado with spiced yogurt. Naturally, the bakery's strongest suit is the dessert selection, which includes dainty meringues and marshmallows, brownies and cupcakes. Bea's has expanded to multiple locations in the capital, but afternoon tea is only available in St. Paul's, Marylebone and the original cafe in Bloomsbury.

The recent 10th Anniversary collection features the famous McDonald's-inspired Moschino bag -- Pret-a-Portea's edible version is a sponge cake wrapped in red chocolate -- and stiletto cookies inspired by the likes of Nicholas Kirkwood. There are no scones with this themed tea, but that hardly matters given the ample amount of haute treats and savory bites on offer.
