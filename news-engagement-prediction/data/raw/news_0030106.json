Ross Theater on the Warner Bros. lot, the Lumiere Awards honored the \"dreamers\" who are aiming to advance storytelling with technologies including 3D, virtual reality and high dynamic range.

They know science and technology only goes in one direction. … and storytelling is the killer app.” \nIvan Reitman -- who was on hand for Ghostbuster VR , which topped the film & TV VR category--said \"finding new ways of telling a stories in really exciting\" and seeing Ghosbusters fans \"feel that they met the characters [through VR] was a personal thrill. ...
