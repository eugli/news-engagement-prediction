With no timeouts, Kevin Love threw a Hail Mary down the court to find James. James caught the ball, and, smothered by Bradley Beal, stepped back and hit an impossible, turning, fade-away three off the glass to tie the game. \nThe Wizards were unable to score on a tip-in to win the game, and it went to overtime. \nJames later fouled out early in overtime, but the Cavs can thank him for at least getting them to an extra period. \nLeBron James layup FOR THE WIN!!!! pic.twitter.com/zSMFgajCju â€” Rob Perez (@World_Wide_Wob) February 7, 2017 \nLeBron misses a game winning layup only to bank in a fadeaway 3 to tie it pic.twitter.com/PLal3Ndp4Y", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T21:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T05:22:04.530+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
