Source: AP \nRunning as the third truck in the line behind Crafton when the crash happened, Grala’s car missed centre-punching Rhodes’ truck by millimetres. \n“There wasn’t any way I was going to lift,” Grala said. \n“I was just going to go low and cross my fingers and close my eyes a little bit. Luckily, it worked out for me. I can’t believe it. This is just so surreal.” \nAustin Wayne Self ended up claiming second, with Chase Briscoe, John Hunter Nemechek and his father, veteran NASCAR driver Joe Nemechek, rounding out the top five. \nThe last-lap accident took out many of the top trucks on the night, including defending series champion Johnny Sauter, who had won the event’s first two stages and dominated much of the race. \nThe last lap crash put a full-stop on a night that had seen more than its fair share of big ones. \nThe first involved 17 trucks, and came as the field came out of the tri-oval to start Lap 2.

Source: AP \nThe No. 29 Ford of Chase Briscoe hooked the rear end of the No. 18 Toyota of Noah Gragson, setting off a chain reaction. \n“I was running seventh or eighth at the time and felt like I just got popped from behind by the 29 going through (Turns) 1 and 2. … I had a good time out there for the lap that I got,” Gragson, an 18-year-old driving for Kyle Busch Motorsports, told FOX Sports. \nAnother would occur just as the first ‘Stage’ wrapped up. \nAs reigning series champion Johnny Sauter crossed the line to take the bonus points, the No. 4 truck of Christopher Bell got airborne. \nhe No. 23 GMS Racing Chevrolet of Spencer Gallagher triggered the accident by getting into the back of the No. 7 Toyota of Brett Moffitt, who then clipped Bell’s truck and sent it into a wild, flying spin that took all four wheels off the ground. \nAmazingly, Bell not only landed safely but continued on in the race — before being involved in another multi-truck crash with 29 laps to go. \nA spin from John Hunter Nemechek brought out a caution and set up the final restart with three laps to go. Crafton eventually surged in front of Sauter and they were battling for the lead when the biggest, wildest wreck of a night full of them occurred. \n— With foxsports.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T10:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T06:35:47.797+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
