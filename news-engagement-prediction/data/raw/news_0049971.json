Photo: Chance Yeh/Getty Images Amid speculation that Lindsay Lohan may be converting to Islam , the actress now says she was recently a victim of Islamophobia. While traveling from London to New York after meeting with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Turkey to discuss the global refugee crisis, Lohan claims she was “racially profiled for the first time in my life” at Heathrow Airport for wearing a headscarf. She told Piers Morgan on Good Morning Britain , “[British Airport Security] opened my passport and saw ‘Lindsay Lohan’ and started immediately apologizing, but then said ‘please take off your headscarf.’ And I did, it’s okay.” (She says she was wearing a headscarf “out of personal respect” for Turkish culture.)\nHowever, the incident forced Lohan to consider how she benefited from her privilege as both a celebrity and non-Muslim: “What scared me in that moment [is] how would another woman who doesn’t feel comfortable taking off her headscarf feel? That was really interesting to me. I was kind of in shock. It was jarring.” As for her religion, Lohan said it wouldn’t be right to talk about converting until she’s finished studying the Koran, but that “it’s a consideration.”\n\nTags: racial profiling lindsay lohan islamophobia Lindsay Lohan Racially Profiled for Wearing a Headscarf Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories Bono Praises Mike Pence for His Commitment to AIDS Relief Drake on Grammy Wins: ‘I Don’t Even Want Them’ Mariah Carey Is Still Feeling ‘Victimized’ by Her New Year’s Eve Performance Most Viewed Stories The Bachelor Recap: No Place Like Home Airplane Passenger Reportedly Called Police After Feeling ‘Not Comfortable’ Sitting Next to Mykki Blanco Jane the Virgin Recap: Reality Check Vanderpump Rules Recap: Life Is a Drag Timeless Season-Finale Recap: Lost in Time What to Stream Now See what's new and notable on Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, and HBO Bates Motel Season-Premiere Recap: Mother Knows Best For a Black Artist to Win Album of the Year, They Have to Make an Album of the Decade Emma Watson’s Poor Provincial Town Honestly Seems Pretty Great in the New Beauty and the Beast ’s ‘Belle’ Clip Milo Yiannopoulos Lost His Book Deal Over Pedophilia Comments The Walking Dead Recap: Meet the Vulcans Most Popular Video On Vulture An Evolution of Beyoncé’s Grammy Performances Latest News from Vulture 17 mins ago Katy Perry’s ‘Chained to the Rhythm’ Video Is Set in a Dystopian Theme Park Please keep your arms and legs inside the dystopia at all times.\n9:03 a.m. Lindsay Lohan Says She Was Racially Profiled for Wearing a Headscarf “How would another woman who doesn’t feel comfortable taking off her headscarf feel?”\n2:20 a.m. Long Lost Walt Whitman Novel Has Been Found 165 Years Later Whitman’s Life and Adventures of Jack Engle is considered a precursor to Leaves of Grass. \n1:47 a.m. The Bachelor Recap: No Place Like Home I think I’m falling for Corinne?\n12:54 a.m. Conan O’Brien Is Moonlighting As a Telenovela Actor in Mi Adorable Maldició Conan in is Mexico City filming Conan Without Borders: Made in Mexico. \n12:37 a.m. Jane the Virgin Recap: Reality Check A defense of Jane the Virgin ’s three-year time jump.\n12:01 a.m. Timeless Season-Finale Recap: Lost in Time Is this the end of Timeless ?
