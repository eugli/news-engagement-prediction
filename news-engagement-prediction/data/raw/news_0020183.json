Panneerselvam has written a letter to the chief manager of Bank of India requesting the bank to \"not let anyone else operate\" the party's current account (No. 801220110000521) without his \"written consent and instructions.\" Panneerselvam issued the letter in his capacity as the treasurer of the AIADMK. Sasikala had sacked Panneerselvam as treasurer on Tuesday following his revolt against the leadership. However, Panneerselvam cited rule 20 sub-clause 2 of the bylaws of the AIADMK and said that a general secretary has yet to be appointed in accordance to it. Since the demise of J Jayalalithaa, \"...the post of general secretary of AIADMK remains vacant,\" he noted. \"Under sub clause 5 of rule 20 of the by-laws, the party treasurer is allowed to hold office until a general secretary assumes office in accordance with sub clause 2,\" he said.
