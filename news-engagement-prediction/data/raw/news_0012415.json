Cavs forwards Kevin Love and LeBron James (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 11:38 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 11:38 p.m. ET \nLeBron James has heard those Carmelo Anthony-for-Kevin Love trade rumors, and he's just done with all of them. \nAfter the Cavs outlasted the Wizards in a thrilling overtime win Monday night , James responded to the latest report from Knicks beat writer Frank Isola of the New York Daily News. Isola cited an anonymous league source in saying James was pushing the Cavs' front office to trade for Anthony, even if that meant sending Love to New York. \nMORE: A 'Melo-for-Love trade still doesn't make sense for Cavs \nSo LeBron, your thoughts on the matter? \n\"It's trash,\" James said. \"And the guy who wrote it is trash, too, for writing that. Especially during a game like that.\" LeBron responds to the recent K Love/Melo trade rumors... pic.twitter.com/zmLTovOpxN — NBA on TNT (@NBAonTNT) February 7, 2017 \nAlrighty then! \nCavs coach Ty Lue said after the game Love is \"not going anywhere,\" and Love himself seems to be brushing off the latest speculation. KLove on the rumor: \"It's a lie. What do they say? A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to put his pants on\" — Dave McMenamin (@mcten) February 7, 2017 \nIf anyone still doubted what Love means to Cleveland's back-to-back title hopes, his play against Washington shut that down. Love put up a team-high 39 points in the Cavs' victory, shooting 11 of 17 from the field, 6 of 10 from 3-point range and a perfect 11 of 11 from the free-throw line. \nThe Cavs play the Knicks one more time this season on Feb. 23, the day of the NBA trade deadline. We're betting Love remains in the Cavs' starting lineup.
