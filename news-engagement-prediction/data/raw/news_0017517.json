We will do whatever we can to aid those affected. But finally the earthquake did come. I was wondering why the quake came when it did. The threat was given a long time ago. There must be some reason that Mother Earth was so angry.\" \n\nWithout taking names, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today targeted Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi - punning on his December 9 threat of causing a proverbial political earthquake and his recent SCAM acronyms. \n\nLeading the opposition's charge against the government demonetization move, Rahul Gandhi had, in December last year, accused the government of running away from a debate and said \"there would be an earthquake if they allow me to speak.\" \n\nIn his reply to the discussion on motion of thanks to the President's address on February 1, the Prime Minister today linked that statement and Mr Gandhi's SCAM acronym and quipped,\" How can someone see sewa or any other positive virtue in a scam?\" \n\nRahul Gandhi, on Sunday, said that for him S stands for 'service', C for 'courage', A for 'ability' and M for 'modesty' - a latest in a series of scam acronyms doing the rounds, including those by UP chief minister Akhilesk Yadav and the PM. \n\nPM attacks Mallikarjun's Kharge's 'Dog' Statement \n\nIn Lok Sabha today, PM Modi's attack on the Congress party included a retort at Leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge . \n\nSpeaking earlier in the same debate, Kharge said that while Indira Gandhi had sacrificed her life for the nation and other Congress leaders had made sacrifices for India's independence, the PM and his party members cannot claim the patriotism of \"even a dog from his family.\" \n\nThe PM's response today was: \"We are not brought up in this sort of obsequious tradition\" (Hum kutton wali parampara se pale bade nahin hain). \n\n\"There are many people here like me who were born after independence, we were not lucky to fight in the freedom struggle, but we are living and working for India,\" PM Modi said. He added: \"I have said it in the past- every Prime Minister has contributed to the nation. But there is a party here that wants to attribute everything to one family.\" \n\nResponding to the Opposition protests against the Budget being presented ahead of elections in five states, PM Modi said \"we do not see everything from the prism of elections. The interests of the nation are supreme for us. It does not matter how big you are, you will have to give back what belongs to the poor. My fight is for the poor,\" he said. \n\nThe PM also defended his government's move to ban 500 and 1000 rupee notes. \"When can you have an operation? When the body is healthy. The economy was doing well and thus our decision was taken at the right time. Like Swachh Bharat, the decision on demonetisation is a movement to clean India (from corruption and black money),\" he said. \n\nThe PM's statements came as India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, prepares to go to the hustings in the first of a seven-phase poll. The BJP got 72 of the state's 80 Lok Sabha seats in 2014. Poll pundits say UP's results will act as a barometer a likely second term for PM Modi's government in 2019. \n\nBesides UP, Punjab, Goa, Manipur and Uttarakhand are the states electing their governments. Punjab and Goa voted last week in record numbers; Uttaakhand will vote on February 15 and Manipur in the first week of March. Results to all five states all be declared on March 11.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T21:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T10:44:51.568+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
