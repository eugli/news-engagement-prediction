Article continues below \nEubank eventually picked up the victory in the tenth round and he quickly turned his attention to his potential future opponents almost immediately after dispatching Quinlan. \nFor the last few years, Eubank has been frustrated the pace at which he has been allowed to progress onto the global stage, however, Saturday night's win has left him in no doubt, a world title shot must come next.

Andre Ward is not in the super middleweight or middleweight divisions. We’re chasing James DeGale, then that’s what we shall do. I sparred with him many years ago.\" \n\"I know what he is, and I know what I can do to him. That’s the fight people want to see, and now we have the platform. There are great fights to be made, and I’m right in the mix now.\" \nBut DeGale isn't the only big opponent the 27-year-old is hoping to land a punch on. His father, Chris Eubank Sr, added that pound-for-pound king Gennady Golovkin is someone else they will hope to hold talks with. \n\"At middleweight, they’re talking about Golovkin, and we’re going to be negotiating with him too,\" said Eubank Sr. \n\"Where Golovkin is concerned, we’re looking to make that fight ASAP at middleweight. Those are the two he has in mind. \n\"At middleweight, it’s Golovkin because we got swindled out of that fight in 2016. We got swindled out of that fight. Now those guys are to the side. Now we can plow ahead and make up for lost time. We only lost six months. He’s been right on target.\" \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
