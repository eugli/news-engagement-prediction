Missouri and Illinois fans should be wishing the whispers of their team potentially making a run at the man turn out to be more than empty chatter. Two once-proud programs in need of an overhaul, and the same coach belongs at the top of both hot boards: Cuonzo Martin. \nIf the Tigers and Illini can find a better realistic candidate than California's coach, I'll listen. But my guy checks plenty of boxes. \nHe's young and still improving — yet also proven, a well-respected member of a Gene Keady coaching tree that prioritizes defense and discipline. \nHe's a Midwesterner who left and won elsewhere, making many wonder what he might be able to accomplish if he returns. \nHe recruits AND develops. \nHe instills this special brand of toughness in his teams, the kind that is in him. It's what launched him from \"the hole\" — the unofficial name of the East St. Louis housing project he once called home — to a stellar career at Purdue. It's what helped him wrestle with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and win. \nAnd he does all of this while staying on the right side of NCAA rules. Some people still care about such things. \nFull disclosure: I'm campaigning for a candidate who wants nothing to do with this discussion at the moment. Martin's contract at Cal, which The Mercury News reported pays him an average of $1.84 million per year, runs through the 2020-21 season. And neither Mizzou nor Illinois has an opening to address. The only thing on Martin's mind right now is finding a way to beat sixth-ranked Oregon tonight. It would be a big win for his on-the-bubble Golden Bears. \nBut common sense says Mizzou athletics director Jim Sterk and his Illinois counterpart Josh Whitman need to make a move as soon as the season ends. Please zoom out from Illinois' current two-game winning streak and Mizzou's hard-fought 10-point loss against No. 11 Kentucky. Kim Anderson's Tigers just clinched their third consecutive 20-loss season, a first for not only Mizzou, but the entire SEC. John Groce's Illini have not appeared in the NCAA tournament since his first season (2012-13). They're headed toward their fourth consecutive miss, which would be the program's first four-season tournament drought in 37 years. That's not Illinois basketball, folks. \nAre there complicating factors for both embattled coaches? Sure. Do any of them overshadow the overall trends? No. \nEnter Martin. \nThe 45-year-old is two wins away from his sixth 20-win season in nine years as a head coach. Between Missouri State (2008-11), Tennessee (2011-14) and Cal he has a .612 winning percentage, and that includes his 11-20 debut at Missouri State in 2008-09. His first losing season was his last. \nMartin's Missouri State team won the program's first-ever regular season Missouri Valley championship in 2011, an accomplishment that made him the first Missouri State coach to win the league's coach of the year award. \nI covered him at Tennessee, where he had to battle Bruce Pearl's shadow while attempting to clean up the mess the fired rule-breaker left behind. Beating three top-25 opponents, taking down every SEC foe at least once and outperforming preseason predictions in his first two seasons did little to ease the pressure from an impatient fan base and cold-blooded administrators. Then in 2014, Martin's Volunteers pulled off one of the most remarkable reversals I've ever witnessed. The Vols saved a seemingly sinking season that saw tens of thousands of Tennessee fans sign an online petition calling for Pearl's return. That team made it all the way to the Sweet 16. And perhaps it would have reached the Elite 8 had a questionable charge call not spoiled a potentially game-tying play against Michigan with six seconds to go. \n\"He's more than a coach to us,\" guard Jordan McRae, now with the Cleveland Cavaliers, said of Martin during the memorable run. \"When it got to the point where people were saying what they were saying, you've got to fight for somebody like that.\" \nFew blamed Martin for bolting to Cal despite Tennessee awkwardly attempting to extend his contract. He went 18-15 in year one, then followed it up with a 23-11 season that secured a program-best No. 4 seed in the NCAA tournament. The Golden Bears should be back in the Big Dance again this year if they take care of business. \nSome gripe about Martin's reliance on motion offense and man-to-man defense, but the records show a .588 winning percentage in Power 5 conference games, top-five conference finishes in five of his last six seasons and multiple top-25 finishes nationally in scoring defense. \nCritics of Martin's recruiting have lost their ground. \nHe's convinced a five-star recruits to stay home (Jarnell Stokes, Robert Hubbs, Ivan Rabb). He's convinced a five-star recruit to leave Georgia for the West Coast (Jaylen Brown). He's found diamonds in the rough, like former three-star guard Josh Richardson, a two-time SEC all defensive team member who now plays for the Miami Heat. \nThere are other names Mizzou and Illinois should consider when they dive into the coaching search waters. \nFor Illinois ... Would Monty Williams thrive in a college job? Could Tony Bennett be poached from Virginia? \nFor Mizzou ... Brad Underwood is underpaid for a Big 12 coach. What if Tom Crean gets canned? Hey, Bennett once worked for Sterk. \nComing up with names has become more interesting than watching most of the games. \nBut the wish list should start with Martin. He would have a lot to think about — if the price was right. \nMartin is no longer working for the athletics director who hired him. Cal coaches can grow tired of the strict academic standards that make it harder to cast as wide of a recruiting net as their Pac-12 peers. Both Mizzou and Illinois would bring Martin's family closer to the relatives and friends who still call St. Louis home. Martin and his top assistant Tracy Webster know the recruiting terrain well, and would benefit from being able to pitch Martin's story to local recruits whose parents remember Martin and LaPhonso Ellis starring at at East St. Louis' Lincoln High. Martin might even put a stop in SLU coach Travis Ford's new prospect pipeline. A relationship with Mizzou exists, because the Tigers have considered Martin as a candidate in the past. Even in Tennessee, Martin kept the Big Ten Network on his TV. The longer you think about it, the more it makes sense. For either school. \nSome advice for Mizzou and Illinois: Cut the check. Convince Cuonzo to leave Cal. Make the hire that your Braggin' Rights foe will regret missing out on. \nBen Frederickson", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:38:34.597+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
