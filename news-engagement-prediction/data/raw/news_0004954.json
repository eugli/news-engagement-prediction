And I'm back on the road, on my bike. I'm happy about that, but it definitely has been nerve-racking.\"\nThe accused was formally charged Jan. 28, and released on a recognizance to appear in court.\nCyclist Victor Jung is pleased with the charges but also wants the motorist to pay for damage to his bicycle.
