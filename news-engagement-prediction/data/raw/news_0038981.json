The studio is still intent on making the film. \nThe news comes after star Ben Affleck decided to step down as director in order to focus on the role of playing the Caped Crusader. Related Ben Affleck Will Not Direct ‘The Batman’ (EXCLUSIVE) \n“There are certain characters who hold a special place in the hearts of millions,” Affleck said in a statement. “Performing this role demands focus, passion and the very best performance I can give. It has become clear that I cannot do both jobs to the level they require. Together with the studio, I have decided to find a partner in a director who will collaborate with me on this massive film. I am still in this, and we are making it, but we are currently looking for a director. I remain extremely committed to this project, and look forward to bringing this to life for fans around the world.” \nAffleck and Geoff Johns co-wrote the script with Chris Terrio recently doing a polish and delivering that script to the studio. \nThis film is not the only project that has hit some speed bumps in recent months after “The Flash” lost director Rick Famuyiwa.
