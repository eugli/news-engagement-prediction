I had the pleasure of meeting the eight-year old actor few days ago, where we discussed about how the film, his co-stars namely Dev Patel in Lion and Freida Pinto in Love Sonia, his successful stint at Golden Globes, his favourite actor in Bollywood and more. \nThe one thing that stood out was his innocence with which he answered all the questions. He even went on to talk about his favourite wrestlers and how he wanted to meet them. He also expressed his desire to meet his favourite star Ajay Devgn. Having interviewed quite a few celebs it was an unusual experience for me and while web surfing, I came across a video of an international chat show called ‘Access Hollywood Live’ and it was once again the charm of Sunny Pawar that bowled me over. It doesn’t matter whether he is India or in Hollywood, he is quite a charmer and very cute. Also present at the chat show was his interpreter who was helping him as well as the hosts understand what one is saying. I specifically loved the way he answered, when asked about his favourite American food and he answered he likes Indian food in ‘Mumbaiya Hindi’.
