A Grand Final belting that was a belittling, but also a day to look back on and put you in a happy place. \nWell, perhaps not if you’re in Adelaide. The story of your electricity supply is a happier tale, but we digress. \nArchie Thompson had an inkling he was going to have the 90 minutes of a lifetime on 18 February, 2007. \n“I was very big on The Secret.” \nNow before we go on, what is ‘The Secret’? Written by an Aussie, Rhonda Byrne, it’s a self-help guide focusing on the laws of attraction that Oprah Winfrey liked so naturally, it went gangbusters. Top of New York bestseller list, 300 million copies and so on. The Secret by Rhonda Byrne.

Some believe it in, others are sceptical, but if you’re a Melbourne Victory fan, don’t be one of the many to question the tome. It put Archie, not your prototypical robot athlete, in havoc-wrecking thought space. \n“The book was all about the universe and all that, sounds corny, but I was almost brainwashed into believing that sort of stuff. So I knew something was going to happen. I predicted at the press conference the day before the game I was going to score three goals, I actually said that! I got it wrong.” \nOut he went and scored five. \nIt was a bloodbath. Be sure, if it happened now, within 3.2 seconds some kid on Twitter would depict a pop culture setting in the shape of a meme. All we could do back then was widen the eyes as Archie went 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. \nWas there any pity from the executioner? \n“Looking back on it, there was a little. Might be one goal, my 4th just after halftime, it did look a little offside. Archie Thompson celebrates his hat trick goal. Source: News Corp Australia \n“Mind you after the game they were having a big cry at the media conference so I didn’t feel too sorry for them then. And to be honest, Ross (Aloisi) didn’t help them much with a stupid challenge (which saw him sent off in the 34th minute).” \n10 years on, it is still a talking point, even with those he made fools of. \n“Was with Ang Costanzo - who I played with at Marconi - a couple of weeks ago. His wife said at halftime she went form the Adelaide to the Victory supporters! We just had a laugh, what can you do.” \nArchie is good at that. Having a laugh. The enthusiasm of a teenager refuses to depart. He reckons qualifying for the World Cup in 2005 was the career highlight, but domestically the five in front of 55,000 trumps all. Thompson scores his fourth goal of the Grand Final. Source: News Limited \n“To be honest I was just in the right place at the right time. If I could give the Joe Marston Medal to anyone, I would give it to Fred. But I’ll take it, sometimes it doesn’t happen like that, you play an amazing match and not score a goal. I think I had six touches the whole Grand Final, and my sixth touch was s***! \n“Everything was great, I believed in myself that something was going to happen. Believed in the team, I knew it was all going to be good. Honestly didn’t think it would be that good.” \nReally, there is nothing to learn from that day. \nArchie still occasionally picks up The Secret, but he or no-one else has come close to scoring 5 in a decider. \nIt was a one of a kind. \nBit like the guy who scored them.
