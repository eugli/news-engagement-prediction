The only other candidate for secretary general, Juan Moreno Yagüe, a low-profile Andalusian MP, attracted just 10.9% of the vote.\nIglesias also stamped his authority on the leadership council: 37 of his choices were voted on to the council, compared with 23 of Errejón’s. His political agenda attracted the support of 56% of activists; 33% who voted for Errejón’s plans.\nSpeaking after the results, a jubilant Iglesias called for unity and humility as the party continued its fight against the ruling conservative People’s party. \n\n“There’s no doubt we’ve made a lot of mistakes,” he said. “It’s impossible not to when you have to make decisions. But I want to promise you all something: we’ll never be on the wrong side. Together with our people, we must carrying on the social project of a building sovereign country that is fairer, more equal, more representative, more democratic and more modern, and in which equality between men and women is a reality.”\nIglesias said the “wind of change” was still blowing and that Podemos had grown stronger and more mature. He ended the speech with a familiar flourish: “Unity! Humility! Onto victory!”\nBehind Iglesias on the stage at Madrid’s Vistalegre arena, Errejón stood stoney faced. He has been openly critical of the decision, shortly before the June election, for Podemos to run on a joint ticket with United Left (IU), a leftwing coalition that includes the Communist party of Spain . \nThe election results were bitterly disappointing: despite predictions that the new coalition would overtake the Spanish socialist party, the PSOE, it came third and its constituent parties lost 1.2m of the votes they had won in December 2015. \nErrejón has also advocated a more conciliatory approach to the PSOE and for Podemos to focus more on consolidating its parliamentary influence and power.\nHis fate in the wake of Sunday’s defeat remains unclear. However, Iglesias has stressed his long and robust friendship with Errejón and the two have pledged to work together regardless of the result. Last week Iglesias told the Guardian that he hoped Errejón would continue to contribute to the party , adding: “I want to have the best people close to me even if they don’t think like me.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T16:27:17.762+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
