Rousey returned from her first career loss to Holly Holm by facing current UFC bantamweight champion Amanda Nunes on Dec. 30 in Las Vegas at UFC 207. Rousey ultimately lost to Nunes even quicker than she did to Holm, and for Cyborg — Rousey’s longtime rival and one of the greatest MMA fighters of all-time — there is no doubt that \"Rowdy\" should have targeted a return against someone easier. \"I really don’t understand why she fight straight for the belt right after her loss to Holly Holm,” Cyborg told Ariel Helwani on a recent edition of The MMA Hour . \"One year, no fight, you know? She fights someone, Amanda, with a lot of fights in the year already, and she’s one year off.\" The Brazilian said she doesn’t know if Rousey will ever fight again, especially after Holm “broke her mind” at UFC 193 . \"I think she needed one fight, get a win and be confident again, and go for the belt,” Cyborg said. \"I think it's hard to fight straight for the belt, somebody fights all year and she’s one year off. I really think if I’m managing someone, I don’t do like this. I’d give more fights for her, and she get confident again. Because after the Holly Holm fight, it broke her mind.\" At this point, it’s unlikely that a fight between Rousey and Cyborg ever happens. The Brazilian said the reason for that is something Cyborg already knew for years: Rousey “cannot take a punch.\" \"I never hated Ronda,” Cyborg said. \"She’s always talked about me, she did that to promote herself because when she started nobody knew her, and she talked about me for people to know who she is. And she opened the doors for women’s MMA. \"I think me and her fight is the biggest fight ever, but after she lost two fights… I really knew she cannot take a punch. I knew this, you know? And the fight is never gonna happen and never happened before because she knows what’s gonna happen. And a lot of people know what’s gonna happen. Same thing Amanda did, I’m gonna do worse. And everybody knows this, and this fight never happened.\" Cyborg admitted that her rival made a huge impact in the sport, despite the that exists animosity between them, and she said that even though Rousey doesn’t actually need to compete again, she can bounce back if she does the right things. \"She did a lot of good things, she opened the door for the division for the girls,” Cyborg said. \"My coach said he could help train because, you know, it’s never gonna happen this fight. It doesn’t make me sad, you know? I think when you lose the fight it’s not the end of the world, you can keep training and catch up and try again better, you know? But she really don't need this. Make a lot of money, she can do other things for the sport too, just (outside) the cage.\" Latest From Our Partners", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T16:28:41.601+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
