Slot to Kentucky Links \nSpartanburg (S.C.) Day School forward Zion Williamson has quickly become the most talked about prospect in the country and by far the hottest name on the recruiting trail today. \nNot only is Williamson the No. 1 overall prospect in the 2017 class according to 247Sports and had Drake spotted wearing his No. 12 jersey, he continually amazes with his weekly feats of freakish athleticism. \nGet the latest UK news sent straight to your inbox with out EMAIL NEWSLETTER \nHis latest jaw-dropper came Monday night against Shannon Forest, where on a fastbreak, he propelled his 6-foot-7, 220-pound frame into the air for a thunderous 360-degree windmill slam. \nHaving already won Region Player of the Year, Williamson recorded his 27th game of 30+ points in the regional title game Tuesday night, breaking a 26-year-old state record. He needs only 34 more points to break the state's single-season scoring record. \nWilliamson, who already holds offers from Duke, North Carolina and Kansas among many others, averaged 43 points on 42 of 55 shooting (76.3 percent), 14.3 rebounds and 2.6 blocks at the Farm Bureau Classic in front of Kentucky assistant Joel Justus . \nHe then took an unofficial visit to Kentucky for the Wildcats' game against Kansas Jan. 28. UK coach John Calipari followed that up with a visit to his school that week but has yet to offer. \nWilliamson has drawn comparisons to both former Wildcats Julius Randle and Jamal Mashburn. \nSign up now and get 3 months of VIP access to CatsPause.com for the price of 1!
