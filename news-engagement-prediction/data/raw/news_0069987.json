(Nathan Papes/The Springfield News-Leader via AP) \nJEFFERSON CITY • Gov. Eric Greitens said he will talk with President Trump this weekend about policies that will bring more jobs to Missouri. \nThe Republican governor is scheduled to be in the nation's capital Sunday and Monday as part of his third visit to Washington DC since he took office on Jan. 9. \nThe political newcomer said he will discuss loosening federal regulations that could limit business investment in the state, as well as urge Trump to help states lower the cost of providing health insurance for the poor. \n“It’s so much fun being in office right now,” Greitens said during an interview Thursday on the Mark Reardon Show on KMOX radio. “We stand ready to work with them to get a solution.” \nAlthough an official schedule has not been released, Greitens is scheduled to be at the White House Sunday and Monday as part of a National Governors Association meeting, which will include a visit with Trump. \nHe also is attending meetings associated with the Republican Governors Association while in town. \nHe will leave for Washington after attending a political event in Springfield on Saturday. \nGreitens is scheduled to participate in a “meet and greet” with supporters as part of the Missouri Republican Party’s Lincoln Days event. \nIn his interview on Tuesday, Greitens said he is mulling the use of the state highway patrol to fight crime in St. Louis. \n“There are options for using state resources,” Greitens said. “It’s one of the options we’re looking at right now.” \nGreitens also defended his record in dealing with the Capitol press corps, saying interviews with national and local media, as well as his posts on Facebook, should mute any criticism that he has held few press conferences. \n“I actually think we’ve done a really good job reaching out to the people of Missouri,” Greitens said.
