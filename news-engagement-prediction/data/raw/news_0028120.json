And that's in the past year alone. Take a fresh look at her IMDB page and you'll remember the 32-year-old actress, who made her big-screen debut in 1998, has also appeared in Cold Mountain , United States of Leland , and Joe Wright's Pride and Prejudice. (How could you have forgotten?) In between, she's recorded music, discovered a gift for photography, and cemented her status as an artsy indie darling — even if she did play Johanna Mason in the blockbuster Hunger Games franchise. Here, Malone, who lives in Nevada and is currently shooting a movie in Cincinnati, talks Hollywood, awards season, and why she wants to protect her son from social media.\n You give off the vibe of a Hollywood outsider. Is that how you see yourself?\nI don’t see myself on those terms, exactly. But I think what I consider fulfillment is not what most people in Hollywood see as fulfillment. What motivates me might be different. There are a lot of notches in my belt I don’t need to cut, and a lot of people are very notch hungry. I’m pretty happy in the life that I’ve created, and the older I get, it’s getting harder and harder to pull myself away from that life.\nWhat are the notches you’re talking about?\nFor me, it’s enough to play for a couple days with a really great director, take small parts, and have my freedom. But for a lot of people that’s not enough. That’s not leading roles. That’s not pursuing awards material. That’s not the cover of a magazine. That’s not you becoming a director and you becoming a writer. It’s never enough. There’s a really interesting Quote: that’s like, “Reaching success is the last easy thing that you’ll do,” because everything after that is work maintaining success. I guess that’s what I’m talking about with notches. A lot of people invest a lot of their time and energy in the maintaining of success. Whereas I’ve been extremely lucky to flirt with it and get the fuck out — and come back. Because I tend to work with directors that hire me almost out of complete isolation. I’ve left Hollywood three times already. I’m always coming back. I wonder when I will finally make the break.\nWhy did you leave those three times? What were the boiling points?\nJust that I was over the idea. Well, when I was 18, I didn’t think that I was going to become the person that I wanted to become growing up in Hollywood, so I got the fuck out. I could see elements of myself becoming who I didn’t want to become. I wanted to be a different woman. And then when I was 24 I was just so fed up with the amount of work I was putting into it and the amount I was getting back. I was getting so little back that I decided to invest myself fully in music and art and photography, because that was giving me so much more. And I guess the third time I left because I was pregnant, and I decided to go get fat and happy somewhere else.\n Were there agents along the way who pressured you to pursue certain roles or who typecast you?\nOh. Agents, managers, lawyers, bystanders, casting directors, directors. Everyone has an opinion of what you need to be in Hollywood. That’s the one thing it’s not deprived of: individuals’ opinions of others. That is the wealth of Hollywood. But I love challenges. I’ve become the woman I am because [there were] a lot of the opinionated people around me starting at a young age, like 10 years old. If it were a world full of bliss, it would be hard to get a lot of things done.\n How has it been, returning to work after having your baby? [She gave birth to her son, Ode, in May 2016.]\nIt was a lot more challenging and hard before I got here, trying to figure out what it was going to be like. But then once I got here, I have such a supportive and awesome partner [poet/photographer Ethan DeLorenzo] and I just really love my job, that it all comes together really easily and naturally.\nThe best weekend of our lives!!! What an incredible blessing to be chosen by this amazing , kind , gentle and beautiful soul to be his parents. Humbled and in complete awe that we get to experience the most ancient and transcendent love that exists. Thank you Ode Mountain DeLorenzo Malone.\nA post shared by Jena Malone (@jenamalone) on May 31, 2016 at 9:26am PDT\n You’ve talked about growing up poor, moving around a lot. What from your own childhood do you want to recreate for your son, and what do you want to protect him from?\nI want to protect him from social technology. Even though it is very much a part of this generation, I don’t think it’s something that in the grand scheme of humanity has existed long enough for us to really know the benefits of it. So Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, cell phones — I don’t really believe that just because everyone’s doing it, we have to do it. I’m really interested in raising him wild, raising him raw. Self-directed raising, where he kind of shows me what he’s interested in. I played outside unattended with no supervision all day long [as a kid]. So I’m more interested in trying to find an environment where that can exist and people don’t think it’s shocking. We need to go back to a simpler way of life. I don’t want 100-percent of school children to think that they have to buy new clothes and eat at McDonald’s and live on smart phones and not know what it’s like to pull carrots out of the ground and eat them.\n What do you make of Awards season? You were in Neon Demon and Nocturnal Animals. Did it bother you that they didn’t get more Oscar buzz, outside of Michael Shannon [who is nominated for Best Supporting Actor for Nocturnal Animals ]?\nNo, because I know the game of it. I know if those directors really wanted to make films that were going to garner social acclaim, they would have. And I know that if they wanted those films to succeed in the awards market, they would have gone and found an investor to put money into promoting them and basically play the awards market dance, like you have to. And in a way, I kind of appreciate [that they didn’t], because I know they’re the kind of filmmakers that shy away from that. I always like it when a film that I think is amazing doesn’t end up getting recognition. Because an awards show isn’t about merit. I mean, it is, but it’s merit of such a small pool of thinking, so it’s very hard to feel good about that. So I kind of like it. The filmmaker was just like, Fuck it, I’m not going to spend three months of my life shaking a million hands and doing all this promotion just so I can dress up for a night and get an award that’s going to mean nothing to me tomorrow . Because the film represents something.\n I solemnly vow to continue exploring the darkest truths of humanity with an open heart. All forms of depravity, loneliness , anger, hurt , confusion , deep rooted pains and the suppression of the human heart. Meet ruby. Behind the scenes photo from my latest dive into depravity, beauty and truth. #theneondemon Created by the mind of @nwrefn #nicolaswindingrefn\nA post shared by Jena Malone (@jenamalone) on Jun 24, 2016 at 7:47pm PDT\nIt’s hard to imagine getting excited for the Oscars red carpet when Trump is president.\nI mean, the more I know about the world and the planet, the harder it is for me to embrace the fashion industry anyways — [one of the] most polluting [industries] in the world.\n How do you get around that? How do you put your beliefs into practice?\nI haven’t yet, really. My eyes were opened when I was pregnant, searching for a more pure, ideal way of living, raising my son. There are incredible clothes and [fashion] is an art and there’s so much of it that I really love. But there’s so much of it that’s wrong. So I’m kind of saying no to all of it right now, no new anything, clothes-wise, because we have the clothes we need! And if you’re going to buy it, then get it vintage, secondhand, or do a clothing swap with your girlfriends. I just think the idea of this excessive consumption — like, our consumption is killing the planet. So, I don’t know. I don’t know how I’m going to go forward. Lovesong is nominated for an Independent Spirit Awards. I’m working, actually, [so I can’t attend]. But there was this slight crisis in my brain of like, “Oh my god, what am I going to do?” I’m just like, “Get a vintage dress, your stylist is great.” But it’s more than that. Because you don’t want to live on a soapbox. You want to promote not just doing the right thing but how to change things. So I don’t know where that’s going to lead me, but I’m excited to see.\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.instagram.com/p/BGFAqLrIhTI/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BHD6zKRgDZH/"], "published": "2017-02-13T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T11:24:41.917+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
