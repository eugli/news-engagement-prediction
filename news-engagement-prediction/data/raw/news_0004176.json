But US forces met fierce resistance from Aideed's militia. \nTwo US Black Hawk helicopters were shot down. \nIn the ensuing battle, hundreds of Somalis were estimated to have died. Some 18 Americans and two UN soldiers were killed. \nAt the time, the United States was leading a UN mission to end the civil war and famine in Somalia. \nWithin six months, the US had withdrawn its forces from Somalia. The perceived failure of the Somali mission made the US wary of intervening in African crises. \nAbdulaziz Ali Ibrahim was working with the UN in Somalia at the time and lived in a house 700 yards away from the site of the first helicopter crash. \nWitness : The stories of our times told by the people who were there.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T17:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T12:52:32.862+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
