It joins Thursday companion, freshman comedy The Good Place , which also has been renewed for next season. “We are extremely proud of Superstore , which is one of the smartest and funniest comedies on television today,” said Jennifer Salke, President, NBC Entertainment. “Through the show’s expertly drawn characters, our producers and cast do a remarkable job touching on many issues in which audiences can relate. To its credit, not only does Superstore make us laugh, but it makes us think as well.” Superstore was a breakout when it debuted last midseason, quickly earning a 13-episode Season 2 renewal, which was followed by a full-season pickup last fall. To give it an extra boost, the network aired a special episode of the comedy following its Olympics coverage. While not a runaway hit, Superstore has been well received by critics and a solid 8 PM anchor for the newly relaunched NBC Thursday comedy block this season. So far this season, Superstore originals have averaged a 1.8 rating in adults 18-49 and 5.7 million viewers overall in L+7, +29% above the 18-49 average in the 8 PM – 8:30 PM time slot last season (excluding sports). Last summer’s special post-Olympic telecast of Superstore delivered 9.7 million viewers, making it broadcast TV’s most-watched Friday comedy in 12 years. Last season Superstore ranked as NBC’s #1 show on digital platforms, generating more than 33 million full-episode views on Hulu, NBC.com and video on demand. Superstore centers around Amy (America Ferrera), the store’s most stalwart employee as well as the glue holding the place together. Jonah (Ben Feldman), who is often the target of his colleagues ribbing, is joined on the floor with his fellow associates, including sardonic Garrett (Colton Dunn), the ambitious Mateo (Nico Santos) and sweet teenager and new mom Cheyenne (Nichole Bloom). Overseeing the store is Glenn (Mark McKinney), the affable, clueless store manager, and Dina (Lauren Ash), the aggressive assistant manager who enforces Cloud 9 policy with an iron fist. Superstore was created and written by Justin Spitzer, who also serves as an executive producer with director Ruben Fleischer, David Bernad and Gabe Miller & Jonathan Green. Superstore is produced by Universal Television, Spitzer Holding Company and The District.
