The show was one of four scheduled this week at the city's new Royal Arena. \n\"We’re very disappointed to have to share with you that unfortunately as Saturday has progressed, James’ health, and specifically his throat, is not improving and he is under strict doctor’s orders to not sing one single note. So sadly we have to report that we will be postponing tomorrow’s show at the Royal Arena until September 2, 2017,\" the band wrote in a note posted to Facebook . \nMetallica's note refers to Friday night's (Feb. 3) gig at the Denmark arena, where Hetfield soldiered through the performance despite admitting he wasn't in top form. (In a clip from the show, seen below, he can be heard addressing the crowd, whose cheers encouraged him to stay: “It’s not fair to you guys, man. You paid a lot of money to come see your favorite band, and we don’t sound good. I want to leave it up to you, man. Would you rather hear us sound better another time?\") \nOn Facebook, the band thanked fans who remained supportive at Friday's concert. \"To those of you who were there yesterday, we appreciate you encouraging us to carry on . . . that meant the world to us! We all felt really bummed that we were unable to give you the maximum Metallica experience; it was one of the most challenging shows we’ve ever played, but your love and support got us through,\" Metallica's message said. \n\"We are monitoring James’ voice on a day-to-day basis so watch this space for updates,\" the band added. \nTicketholders for Sunday night's show will be able to attend the rescheduled date of Sept. 2. Alternately, a limited number of tickets for the band's shows on Feb. 7 and 9 may be available through Ticketmaster Denmark to those who were attending the now-canceled Feb. 5 concert. Refunds are being offered from Ticketmaster to those who cannot attend any of the dates. \nMetallica is slated to perform at this year's Grammys on Feb. 12, after wrapping its run in Copenhagen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T05:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T01:08:47.687+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
