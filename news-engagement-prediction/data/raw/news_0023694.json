Slot to Georgia Links \nFormer Georgia defensive back Sanders Commings is 27 years old and done with football, but isn't stopping him from giving another sport he loves a shot. According to FoxSports' Ken Rosenthal , Commings, with the help of former Major League Baseball player Jerry Hairston Jr. is working to resurrect his career on the diamond. \nThe Augusta, Ga. native was selected by the Kansas City Chiefs in the fifth round of the 2013 NFL Draft but played in only two games because of injury. Baseball, however, has always been the sport Commings seemed to love most.

Rosenthal reports that Commings had plans of playing two sports in college, but it never seemed to work out the way he wanted it to. \n“He had thoughts early on to try to play both in college,\" Former UGA head coach Mark Richt told FoxSports. \"That’s not as easy as you think. I don’t know the exact circumstances of why he did not do that. But I knew baseball was a love of his from the time I met him.” \nStill, Commings had a rock-solid career on the gridiron. In four years as a Bulldog he tallied 154 tackles, six tackles for a loss and eight interceptions while playing mostly cornerback but some safety as well. Hairston, who spent 15 years in the major leagues and comes from a baseball family, believes Commings has what it takes to climb his way to the big show. Not a member?

He’s that good.” \nAccording to Rosenthal, Hairston only needed to see Commings swing the bat three times before he determined that he would train him for his baseball comeback. The two have been working together five days a week and Commings has workouts scheduled with multiple major league teams and a showcase scheduled for March 8. \nBut even now, before those workouts and the chance to show what he can do, teams are interesting in the former football standout simply because of his raw skill set. \n“There already are clubs that are highly interested in him right now because they know it’s a struggle to find guys with his type of skill set – guys who can play both sides of the ball, run it down in the outfield, have a plus arm and be a game-changer on the basepaths,” Hairston told Rosenthal. “Teams are thirsting for athletes everywhere. He’s got stuff that you can’t teach. He’s got speed. He’s got power.” \n(What's next for the Bulldogs?
