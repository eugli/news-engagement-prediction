While Taapsee has expressed that she hasn‚Äôt ever helped anyone to elope, she asked Bollywood‚Äôs Shehanshah Amitabh Bachchan , if he knows of anyone who did that and got married or if he has helped someone in doing that. In response to his Pink co-star‚Äôs question, Amitabh put a short video on Twitter in which he said, ‚ÄúTaapsee Pannu who is working on Runningshaadi.com along with Amit Sadh and Shoojit Sircar, asked me a question on Twitter this morning if I know about someone who has eloped and got married. She asked me give the answer in 10-15 seconds. I know people who have done that but I won‚Äôt talk about them.‚Äù He ended the message by wishing the team well for their film. \nMore from the world of Entertainment: \n\nThe actors, who gave powerful performances in their last film ‚Äì Pink, exchanged good words about each other too.

The actor shared a video for David Dhawan who on his part redirected the question to Taapsee and stated that she is a strong woman who would be all in for eloping, and if there was ever a situation where the boy is about to back out, she would be the one to initiate such plans. \nApart from Runningshaadi.com and Judwaa 2, Taapsee will be seen in Makhna with Saqib Saleem, The Ghazi Attack with Rana Daggubati and Naam Shabana. ¬© The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T12:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T07:58:15.859+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
