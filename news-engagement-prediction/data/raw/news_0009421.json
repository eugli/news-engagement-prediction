Bryan, 40, gushed that the \"Applause\" singer did \"an amazing job\" putting her individual flourishes on the song. He's excited to follow suit. “It's a big moment for me and I'm excited to get out there and hopefully put my stamp on it,” he said. And though some performers might play coy when asked who they're rooting for, Bryan, a Georgia native, isn't afraid of a little backlash from New England Patriots fans; he's rooting for the Atlanta Falcons . “The irony in this is I agreed to do the anthem well before the Falcons got on their post-season roll,” he said. “I'm like, 'Come on, Falcons, you can do this!' So I'm cheering for two reasons, because I can have the opportunity to do the anthem … and … my dad's one of the biggest Falcons fans that I've ever met.” 0 Shares", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T04:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:27:20.622+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
