Key points: Forty per cent of Australian students are disengaged in the classroom Student engagement does not necessarily rely on old fashioned ideas about education Part of the problem lies with teaching training \nThe report, published by the Grattan Institute, also found that some teachers lack the skills to get disengaged students back on track. \nReport author Peter Goss said the reasons for student disengagement were complex. \n\"It can come because they've got problems at home that they're bringing to school, because the teaching is not interesting, or it's too hard or too easy,\" Dr Goss said. \n\"Teachers need to have high expectations, build a good relationship, give clarity and structure. \n\"But also to make sure that all students are actively learning, because if a young brain is not actively involved in thinking about what the teacher wants, then they'll probably be thinking about something else . \" More teacher training needed \nDisengagement is measured by the presence of certain behaviours like being late for class, disrupting other students, and speaking out in an aggressive way. \nDr Goss said the ideal conditions for student engagement do not necessarily have to conform to rigid and old-fashioned ideas about education. \n\"A good learning environment can be quiet or noisy, but it's one where all of the students are actually thinking about the problems and wrestling with it,\" he said. \n\"It doesn't have to be lined up in neat rows, in fact that's probably not the best learning.\" \nAccording to Dr Goss, one of the problems is with teacher training, which does not always give new teachers evidence-based strategies. \n\"Typically one kid would stick her hand up — I'll call her Sally — but as soon as Sally stuck her hand up, all the other kids would say, 'I don't need to think about this',\" he said.
