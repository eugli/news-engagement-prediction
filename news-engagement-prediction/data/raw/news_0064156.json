Season two will consist of 10 episodes — up two from its freshman order. Production will resume in the summer for a likely 2018 return. \nThe Navy SEALs drama starring Walton Goggins (who replaced Joe Manganiello) was picked up straight to series and bowed this year to what History says is cable's No. 1 new show of the year in total viewers (based on live viewership). The series, which has two episodes left in its freshman season, is averaging 2.9 million total viewers with three days of delayed viewing through its first four weeks. When adding seven days of DVR, the Jan. 18 series debut collected 3 million total viewers. \nSix ,as well as History's first original scripted series Vikings — and unscripted efforts The Curse of Oak Island , Alone , Forged in Fire and Swamp People — has helped carry the cable network to two consecutive months of year-over-year growth with February set to continue the momentum. \nProduced in-house by A+E Studios as well as Weinstein Television, Six was created by father and son duo William Jr. and David Broyles. Edwin Hodge, Dominic Adams, Brianne Davis, Nadine Velazquez, Jaylen Moore, Donny Boaz and Nondumiso Tembe co-star. \n\" Six is a captivating drama series that embraces our recent history while being immensely relevant in the climate of today's culture,\" History president Jana Bennett said. \"It has struck a genuine chord with our audience, and we're proud to continue to tell the courageous stories, both on and off the battlefield, of the complex lives of this elite military group.\" \nMilitary dramas have been heating up the TV space lately as broadcast and cable networks alike make a push to target Trump America and underserved audiences. Six joins USA Network's Shooter as having scored second-season renewals, with four other dramas in the works this broadcast pilot season — including another Navy SEALs drama.
