They just hoped the families would get a kick out of the experience. \n’s main concern was not that the press would mob him but that a parent would get hurt. So he had all the moms and dads sign waivers, which also conveniently set him up with permission to use images from the classes during the ensuing media onslaught. \nI had to bring in my sister to help man some of this,” said McIntyre, 37, who was losing his voice Sunday from doing so many interviews. \n—a few of them in tutus, bumbling along after their graceful daughters—have over 18 million views on Facebook. Media outlets ranging from USA Today to BBC Russia picked up the story. On Saturday, students and parents who were part of the viral classes traveled to New York City to perform on Fox & Friends Weekend. \nYour FATHER/DAUGHTER/SON Dance Class was better than ANY anti-depressant!” Gerry Pearson, of Toronto, posted on the studio’s Facebook page Sunday. \nThere are major football players who take dance for agility and balance,” McIntyre said. \"It’s not all about silliness and tutus and sequins and rhinestones. It’s about giving these boys another outlet.” \n’s studio needed boys for a couple of performances. Opening his own studio, which he did eight years ago, was a long-time dream, he said. \n’s such a workout, in fact, that father Leo Romero—whose 11-year-old twins Gabriel and Isabel both study at Philadelphia Dance Center—said he was sore for two days after participating in their back-to-back classes Tuesday afternoon. \nIt was definitely a physical workout and actually made me even more amazed that they do this anywhere from four to five times a week,” Romero said. \n“special way to let feelings flow through movement and just simply relax and let out all the stress and tension gathered from the day.” \n’ participation in dance, McIntyre is now planning for the fathers to join an upcoming performance with the troupe at Walt Disney World this spring. \nThey love their kids,” McIntyre said.“They did this for their kids.
