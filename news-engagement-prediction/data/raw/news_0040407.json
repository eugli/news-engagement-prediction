Even though it’s Hamish and Andy in front of the camera more often than not, Shelton says each project is a group effort. \n“We’re pretty all-in on everything,” he said. \n“Generally we only do one thing at a time at it’s always just based on what we like to do and what we think we might be OK at, essentially. All four of us go all-in on every single thing we do.” \nThe team have an office in Melbourne but Shelton jokes they do all they can to avoid “seriousness”, so they often meet up at each others’ homes to work on their projects. \n“We have been known to miss deadlines because we’ve been playing cricket in the pool,” he said. \nRadio Karate’s latest project is How to Life , a three-episode web series which was co-produced by Laura Waters and Princess Pictures and was released on the weekend by Channel 4 in the UK. Once again, it was a team effort. \n“I wrote it but Tim directed it,” Shelton said. \n“Hamish is also in it and then Hamish and Andy also helped with the script.” Ryan Shelton stars in How to Life. Source: YouTube \nShelton has been developing the idea of How to Life for a few years and was inspired by the popularity of YouTube instructional videos. \n“I’ve always been fascinated by our reliance on random people on the internet to teach us how to do things,” he said. \n“If you want to learn how to fix a toilet, you look up YouTube and there’s some guy called Gary in Wisconsin who is gonna tell you how to do it. The only reason we’re trusting Gary is because he’s on the internet. He could be telling us the complete wrong thing but because he’s had over 100 views, we’re like, ‘Nah, he looks pretty professional.’ So I was fascinated by that trend.” \nIn the five-minute-long episodes, Shelton attempts to teach viewers how to lie, how to French kiss and how to escape boring conversations. \nHe’s joined on screen by Hamish Blake and Aussie comedy legend Gina Riley, who Shelton struggled to keep a straight face around.

She never breaks character. She was right in my face yelling at me, saying lines like, ‘Did you get your precious d**k wet?’ I wrote that line but I still found it so funny because she was saying it.” \nNow that How to Life’s been released, Radio Karate is focusing on its next project which will air on Channel Nine later this year. \n“It’ll be a new Hamish and Andy show which we’re in the process of making at the moment,” Shelton said, careful not to give too much away. \n“It’s very different from Gap Year . It’s still a Hamish and Andy show, it’s still their style and it’s still them being them but the concept of the show is really different.” \nYou can watch the three episodes of How to Life below: How to Life: episode 1 How to Life: episode 2 How to Life: episode 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T03:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:16:49.758+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
