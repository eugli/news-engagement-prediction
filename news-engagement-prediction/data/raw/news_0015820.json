(Photo: Willis Awandu/Standard) \nAn aspirant for the Nairobi governor's seat, Peter Kenneth, has hit out at Governor Evans Kidero and accused him of peddling rumours about his candidacy. \nMr Kenneth said the governor had been spreading the rumour that his (Kenneth's) campaign was being sponsored by \"outsiders\". \n\"I do not need people from another region to run my campaign in Nairobi. This is where I was born. Talk that I belong elsewhere is propaganda being propagated by Governor Kidero,\" he said. \nHe blamed Dr Kidero for presiding over poor delivery of services in Nairobi during his term. \n\"The current office should prove that it can do something in the remaining four months before the end of their term. Let us discuss the issues that affect ordinary citizens,\" he said. \nSince declaring his intention to run for the governor's seat, the former Gatanga MP has been forced to fend off claims from his competitors that he is being imposed on the people of Nairobi by outsiders. \nHe has also denied an alleged meeting with Murang'a business tycoons. \nKenneth will fight for a Jubilee Party ticket against Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko, Nominated MP Johnson Sakaja, Dagoretti South MP Dennis Waweru and former Starehe MP Margaret Wanjiru. \nLast week, Kenneth faced off with the governor at a church service during which Kidero poked fun at him for abandoning his presidential ambitions in favour of the governorship.
