Ad Feedback \n\"Rua was an otherwise completely healthy pup and we have every reason to believe she would have gone on to be a productive breeder.\" \nOne of the world's rarest sea lions, New Zealand sea lions had a population of 10,000 and were classified as critically threatened, the same as kakapo and kiwi. \nRua was last seen alive on Allans Beach on the peninsula in September 2016. \nHer birth at Warrington Beach last summer prompted the local community to name and care for her. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T09:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:44:19.415+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
