One report yesterday said hospitals had blown £2 billion by overpaying for items such as toilet roll, blinds and wet wipes, with items that could have been sent in one hospital’s internal mail being sent by Royal Mail instead. The British Medical Association (BMA) warned that the loss of 15,000 beds ‘risked patient safety’ because nothing had been done to improve the level of care at home. The lack of beds means hospitals are having to cancel operations at the last minute – including cancer and heart surgery – or send patients home before they have properly recovered. Hospitals have axed 15,000 beds in just six years, leaving wards at ‘breaking point’, a shock report reveals today The BMA report also highlights how the NHS has fewer beds per head than nearly every country in Europe The BMA report also highlights how the NHS has fewer beds per head than nearly every country in Europe. The UK has an average of 2.4 beds per 1,000 population, compared to Germany (8), Austria (7.5) and France (6). And it raises concerns over occupancy rates on wards. Hospitals are not meant to be more than 85 per cent occupied, but the report highlights figures showing that nine out of ten exceeded this over the winter. Several hospitals are 99 or even 100 per cent occupied with patients at much higher risk of infections and neglect. Last week an inquest heard that grandmother Mary Muldowney, 57, from Crawley, West Sussex, died from a brain haemorrhage after three hospitals refused to admit her because they had no beds. Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the BMA’s council, said: ‘These figures paint an even bleaker picture of an NHS that is at breaking point. Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the BMA’s council, said: ‘These figures paint an even bleaker picture of an NHS that is at breaking point' ‘High bed occupancy is a symptom of wider pressure and demand on an overstretched and underfunded system. It causes delays in admissions, operations being cancelled and patients being unfairly and sometimes repeatedly let down. 'The delays that vulnerable patients are facing, particularly those with mental health issues, have almost become the norm and this is unacceptable.’ The bed shortage is being exacerbated by the bed-blocking crisis, caused by the problems in the social care sector. With a shortage of home help and places at residential care homes, elderly and vulnerable patients are staying in hospital longer than they should. Former health minister, Lib Dem MP Norman Lamb, said: ‘The situation is getting intolerable, with more cancelled operations, longer delays and those with mental health issues being systematically let down. The Government is failing to properly fund the NHS and patients are paying the price.’ Today’s figures cover all hospital beds, including those on general and maternity wards, as well as in mental health and learning disability centres. An average hospital has 634 beds, so a loss of 15,000 beds is equivalent to almost 24 hospitals. Fiona Johnson, of the Nuffield Trust think-tank, said: ‘The extremely high level of bed occupancy in England’s hospitals creates pressure-cooker conditions for the NHS. ‘The drive to achieve efficiencies by reducing bed numbers has become counterproductive, as there is no slack in the system to accommodate surges in demand and as a result procedures and operations get delayed.’ Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ‘The shameful reality is this overcrowding puts patients at risk and blows apart ministers’ claims to be prioritising safety.’ FAMILY DOCTORS ARE OFFERING FIVE-MINUTE APPOINTMENTS Family doctors are offering patients urgent appointments lasting only five minutes in a bid to meet soaring demand. A snapshot survey found several surgeries offering the same-day slots for anyone who thinks they need to be seen immediately. This includes parents worried about sick children or patients with chest pain or breathing difficulties. GP appointments in England usually last ten minutes and are already among the shortest in Europe. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, of the British Medical Association, said: ‘Five minutes is woefully too short. 'Nine out of ten GPs say they cannot manage in ten-minute appointments.’ An NHS England spokesman said: ‘Modern treatment advances such as minimally invasive surgery, fast-acting anaesthetics and medicines taken at home mean that the length of time patients spend in hospital has been falling in all Western countries. ‘The NHS is highly efficient overall, but there are still meaningful differences in discharge practices and community support across England.’ The Department of Health said: Our hospitals are busier than ever but thanks to the hard work of staff, our performances are still among the best in the world. We have backed the NHS’s own plan for the future with an extra £10 billion by 2020.’ Share or comment on this article 19 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T03:48:54.261+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
