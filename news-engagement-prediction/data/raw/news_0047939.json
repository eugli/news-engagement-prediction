Today we're bringing you not one, not two, but five areas to save money. \nThese are things you might not even realize you're spending money on, or that someone convinced you are a good idea when they really aren't. So, strap in and let's start saving. 1. Rental cable modems \nWe talk a lot about saving on your cable bill because it's one of the bigger ones you probably have. However, even when you've cut it down as low as you can go, there's a charge on your bill that you might not have noticed: modem rental. \nYep, your cable company is charging you $3 to $4 every month for that years-old modem collecting dust on your desk. On the plus side, if something goes wrong with that modem, the cable company will replace it. \nOn the other hand, you can buy a new cable modem with the latest technology for $85 to $100 that will give you more than four years of service. Leasing a modem from the cable company for four years at $4 per month will cost you $192. I guarantee you, your cable company pays nowhere near that much for the modems it provides, so much of that fee is pure profit. \nEven if you don't want to mess with buying your own modem, call up your cable company's customer service. You can usually get the monthly modem fee waived, or have them upgrade you to a new model with faster technology. Learn why you want a new modem and how it can improve your Internet speeds and connection quality.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T09:24:41.332+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
