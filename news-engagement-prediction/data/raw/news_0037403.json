The firm traces its roots back to 1885, when brothers William and James Lever opened a soap-making business in Warrington, Cheshire. Their soap proved so popular that by 1888 they had bought a bigger factory on the Wirral at what was to become Port Sunlight, which became famous for offering good quality housing for workers. In 1930, the firm merged with Dutch margarine company Margarine Unie to form Unilever – widely regarded as the world’s first multi-national. If the firm were taken over it would be the latest leading British company snapped up by foreign buyers. Pioneering tech firm ARM Holdings was taken over by Japan’s SoftBank last year. And the London Stock Exchange is in the midst of a takeover by German rival Deutsche Borse. Kraft owned chocolate maker Mondelez during its controversial takeover of Cadbury in 2010. It promised to safeguard jobs – only to shut Cadbury’s historic factory near Bristol just weeks after the deal was completed (file photo) Unilever and Chicago-based Kraft Heinz are already both global giants with massive bargaining power when setting prices. Last year, Unilever flexed its muscles by attempting to get Tesco to raise prices by 10 per cent following the fall in the pound. On that occasion – dubbed ‘Marmitegate’ – Tesco finished victorious. But many other supermarkets have since hiked their prices. If Unilever and Kraft Heinz combined it would give them even more power to dictate prices as they would control the supply of many brands on the High Street. Last month Unilever chief executive Paul Polman said that shoppers should ‘get used’ to price rises after sterling’s collapse. ‘Others in the industry have done the same thing as we have done in the last few months and where the pound is falling, many more will look at increasing prices,’ he added. Richard Hyman, an independent retail analyst, said: ‘The question is will the retailers have to take a bigger hit if the merger goes through? The answer is probably yes. If the big four supermarkets put their prices up they are going to lose a bit of market share to German discounters Aldi and Lidl.’ A takeover could also put out of business thousands of smaller suppliers who have gained a foothold in bigger stores in recent years. If they posed a threat, the newly-created giant would be able to undercut them. Lib Dem leader Tim Farron criticised the takeover bid, and blamed it on Britain’s decision to quit the EU. He said: ‘This deal would not be happening without Brexit. The Government’s industrial strategy has been completely undermined by its determination to leave the single market.’ Kraft said in a statement: ‘While Unilever has declined the proposal, we look forward to working to reach agreement in the terms of the transaction.
