Indeed, the dwarf star and its seven satellites - with orbits ranging from 1.5 to 12 days - would all fit comfortably in the distance between the Sun and its closest planet, Mercury. \nLIKE A SUNSET \nIf Earth were that close to the Sun, it would be a hellish ball of fire. \nBut because Trappist-1 emits far less radiation, temperatures on its planets - depending on the atmosphere - could be between zero and 100 degrees Celsius (32 and 212 degrees Fahrenheit), the scientists said. \nGillon and his team have started to analyse the chemical make-up of the atmospheres. \"There is at least one combination of molecules, if present with relative abundance, that would tell us there is life, with 99 per cent confidence,\" said Gillon. \nA certain mix of methane, oxygen or ozone, and carbon dioxide, for example, could almost certainly come only from biological sources. \"But except for detecting a message from beyond our solar system from intelligence out there, we will never be 100 percent sure,\" he added. \nSomeone standing on, say, Trappist-1 D, E or F - the three middle planets - would have a breathtaking panorama of the star and its system, Triaud said. \nThe red dwarf - which would loom 10 times larger than the Sun in our sky - would be a \"deep crimson\" shading into a salmon-like colour, he said. \n\"The view would be beautiful - you would have about 200 times less light that from the Sun on Earth at midday,\" he added. \"It would be like the end of a sunset.\" - AFP ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T09:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:52:53.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
