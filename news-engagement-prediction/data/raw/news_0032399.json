But 17-year-old Aimee Jewlachow is celebrating the holiday with not one, but two very special loves in her life. Their names are Spot and Hercules, and they just happen to be her pets. Aimee Jewlachow, 17, celebrated Valentine's Day with her dog Spot and cat Hercules by making them their favorite dish, mini-Lasagna Aimee (pictured with her pets) didn't think it would be right to celebrate the holiday of love without celebrating her beloved cat and dog Aimee decorated her dining room and living room with rose petals, candles and plenty of red Aimee didn't think it would be right to celebrate the holiday of love without celebrating her beloved cat and dog. 'Every pet owner will understand the connection we have with our pets and how much they mean to us in our lives,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'They become a part of our family. Just like any relationship, they deserve a special celebration.' Aimee decided to plan a feast for her pets, at first setting up the dining room table for a meal. She then dressed up her favourite boys in bowties for the special occasion Both Spot and Hercules happily nibbled on their lasagna during the picnic-style dinner When she realised her cat Hercules would be uncomfortable with the height situation, she changed course. 'I didn't want to stress them out,' she said. 'So I set up a small picnic-style dinner for them in our lounge room, which was a lot cuter as well.' Aimee made the pair's favorite meal, lasagna, and decorated the area with roses, red and white balloons, candles, and their favourite toys. The only thing Aimee skipped on was dessert - because both boys are 'getting a little chunky', she said. Aimee then dressed up her beloved pets in bowties and sat down with them for the special meal before reading them the special cards she had written. 'I felt like a proud parent,' she said. 'It was really adorable.' Aimee had originally planned for the dinner to take place in the dining room, before she realised Hercules would be scared by the height of the table So she moved the dinner to the living room, where she said both her pets love to lounge BY THE NUMBERS: PETS ON V-DAY Forty per cent of Australians will be doing something special for their pet on Valentine's Day this year One in five pet owners will prepare a special Valentine's Day dish for their pet Over a quarter of Australians would prefer a date night with their pet over a date with with their partner Sixty-five per cent of Australians say they love their pet more than anyone else Thirty-two per cent said their pet is more loyal than a lover, and twenty-three per cent like the fact that their pet doesn't talk back (unlike a partner!) $71,000,000 is being spent on household pets for Valentine's Day in Australia Source: madpaws.com.au Aimee has plans to continue this tradition for the foreseeable future, even when she has a partner of her own. 'They are a part of my life as well, I see no reason why they shouldn't celebrate Valentine's Day with me,' she said of Spot and Hercules. 'I love them just as much.' And Aimee hopes that by sharing photos of her special day with her pets, she will inspire others to appreciate their furry friends. 'I hope people realise how much their pets actually mean to them, and how much their pets actually love them,' she said. 'Its more than just them being excited when you come home, they mean the absolute world to you and you mean even more to them.' Aimee is actually part of the 40 per cent of Australians who do something special for their pet on Valentine's Day, according to a new study by Mad Paws . One in five pet owners reveal they were preparing a special dish for their pet on the holiday - with 32 per cent admitting they felt their pet was more loyal than a lover. Over a quarter of Australians admitted that they would prefer a date night with their pet over a date with their own partner. It may come as no surprise, then, that $71,000,000 will be spent on household pets for Valentine's Day in Australia. Aimee even wrote separate cards for both Spot and Hercules to let them know how much she loves them Share or comment on this article 196", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T13:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T11:15:08.677+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
