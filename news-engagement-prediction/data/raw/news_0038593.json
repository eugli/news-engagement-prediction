He recalls shouting for help from his mum and trying to get out of the room.’ Sharon Kerr had arranged ‘services’ with John (Picture: Spindrift) \nDuring the attack John was forced to hand over his credit cards and PIN numbers to the pair. \nWhen Kerr returned and asked ‘What the hell’s happened?’, the two attackers fled, allowing John to finally escape.
