Few, though, have been talked up quite as comprehensively as Huw Jones, who makes his Six Nations debut on Saturday for Scotland against Ireland.\nJust two starts into what could be a long Test career, the plaudits have rained down on the 23-year-old. Ireland coach Joe Schmidt identified him as the most likely bolter in this year’s championship, while Scotland assistant coach Jason O’Halloran that he had never seen a centre with such a complete skill set.\nJones announced himself as a player of quality with a brace of tries against Australia on his Murrayfield debut and also has a wonderfully exotic back story. Born in the old Eastern General Hospital in Leith to Edinburgh University alumni Bill and Hillary, he also has a Scottish grandfather. Bill coached Scott Hastings at George Watson’s College, but when Jones was two the family moved from Musselburgh to Kent.\nSo far so ordinary, but when Jones was overlooked by every professional club in England despite starring for Millfield School’s 1st XV, he decided against joining his brother at Swansea University and went to South Africa in 2013 for a gap year. Within a year of joining his local club near Cape Town to play social rugby he was scoring against Orange Free State 11 minutes into his Western Province debut, and the next year he was playing Super Rugby for the Stormers, who listed him on their website as Scottish because of his birthplace (and perhaps because of the Saltire which has hung above his bed since he watched Chris Paterson help Scotland beat Ireland at Murrayfield aged 11).\nWatch | Six Nations 2017: Scotland’s record in the tournament 00:50 S o far, Jones’ progress in a Scotland shirt has been just as dramatic. Despite an injury-enforced lay-off since he won his last Scotland cap, during which he has been back in Cape Town to train with the Stormers, his relish for Saturday is palpable.\n“I grew up watching the Six Nations so I’m slightly nervous and excited, which is always a good thing,” he said. “I’m confident I’m back to where it was in the autumn. It has been quite a journey – I never thought it would happen so quickly.” \nWhile virtually every other player on both sides knows each other well from the Pro12, Jones is playing against another raw newbie, Leinster’s powerful 22-year-old Garry Ringrose, who has just three caps.\n“That is an advantage and a disadvantage,” said Jones. “Going into the November Test I had an advantage because I play against Australians and Argies in Super Rugby. It could be an advantage that Ireland have not seen much of me play.” \nWatch | Six Nations 2017: Scotland player to watch 00:47 J ones’ combination with Alex Dunbar worked well in the autumn and is a well-balanced unit for which head coach Vern Cotter has high hopes. “Huw is an exciting player,” he said. “Everyone knows Stuart [Hogg], Tommy [Seymour] and Sean [Maitland], so it’s good to have another player who can step and run and take the outside break. He complements Alex Dunbar, who takes the shorter lines over the gain line. We think it’s a good mix.” \nThere are two changes up front, where Fraser Brown’s dynamism gets him a start in place of centurion Ross Ford, while Josh Strauss starts at No 8 in place of John Barclay as Scotland muscle up to meet the formidable physical challenge posed by Ireland’s back row.\nAlthough Cotter cautioned against unrealistic expectations, he has high hopes for Scotland. “The guys have a vision for the Six Nations, and that desire we’ve seen for the last two seasons is still there. I can feel a nervousness within the group. They know it’s a big game, but they’re ready to roll their sleeves up and have a go. I think being a little bit nervous means you’re sharper and more on edge. You need that. You need to be wary of the opposition, especially these guys – Ireland have just beaten the All Blacks, Australia and South Africa, they are a very good team.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:35:34.818+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
