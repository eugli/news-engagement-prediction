SEE ALSO: Teenage innovators are improving the bathroom selfie, one random object at a time \nSarah is a high school senior from Kansas. She babysits and enjoys eating taquitos, which are two very normal teen activities. \nHowever, she discovered via text that her neighbor, Amy, had become very concerned with some of Sarah's \"habits.\" Apparently, Amy's husband had seen Sarah driving by while he was out mowing the lawn and had noticed Sarah \"smoking a cigar of some sort.\" my whole neighborhood gossiping about my \"smoking habit\" pic.twitter.com/EuqBMpS7YJ \nâ€” Sarah Holder (@sarahholderr) February 11, 2017 \n\"A lot of children live on the street so I will speak on their behalf and request you keep your habits private from the kids!\" Amy says to Sarah. \nThis is a nice, polite reminder that smoking is not good for a person's health. But Sarah really didn't need it. That \"cigar of some sort\" was actually just a taquito, as we can see in Sarah's response to Amy. \nSarah told BuzzFeed News that she has not gotten a response yet from Amy about the case of the mistaken cigar identity. Sarah also shared that she understands Amy is coming from a good place, describing her neighbor as \"crazy nice.\" \nIn any case, we are glad that Sarah shared her story with the Twitter-world. It's good to remember that teens aren't always to blame for crumbling societal values. Sometimes they just gotta have their taquitos.
