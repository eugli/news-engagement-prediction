Paul Thomas Anderson takes the American Dream and twists it into a grueling nightmare. Daniel Day Lewis' much talked-about performance is certainly not to be missed, as it may be the best performance of his already stellar career. Unfortunately, brilliant performances by Paul Dano and young Dillon Freasier have gone largely overlooked, despite the obvious talent both actors bring to the film. Jonny Greenwood's chilling score (which was, regrettably, inelligible for the Academy Award) is the perfect compliment to this tale of the conflict between faith and ambition. An American Classic by Piano Man 33 Out of any other film that was released last year, \"There Will Be Blood\" will be remembered the most for years to come. It's our generation's \"time capsule\" film. The epic scope of this monumentous masterwork will be talked about as one of the greatest films of all time. \"There Will Be Blood\" is an instant classic. The Film that should've won BEST PICTURE by J.A. Becerra Recently I watched the film that won BEST PICTURE and I felt cheated, it just wasn't as iconic as THERE WILL BEW BLOOD, the acting, cinematography, sounds and the brilliant pictures constructed by PAUL THOMAS ANDERSON and his crew. By far this was the BEST PICTURE of 2007. Daniel Day-Lewis gives the performance of the decade and Paul Thomas Anderson proves why he is the most ambitious director since Kubrick and Scorsese. Smell the oil, taste the revenge and step into the world of Daniel Plainview. \"I'm finished.\" Viewers Also Bought", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T21:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T18:13:00.422+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
