The fearsome God of Thunder is slated to make a comeback with Thor: Ragnarok . The third film will follow the Marvel icon as he explores the cosmos to learn more about Thanos’ plans for the Infinity Stones, and he will run into some unsavory foes along the way. Now, fans can get a better look at what kind of monsters Thor will be facing in the film should they wish. A set of new behind-the-scenes photos from the movie just dropped, and they tease Thor’s battle with Hela, Queen of the Underworld. \nIn one of the images, Chris Hemsworth can be seen in-costume as Thor. Dressed in a cape and arm gauntlets, the hero can be seen throwing a punch at a gruesome actor who looks like a zombie. Of course, fans of The Walking Dead will want to compare the undead creatures, but Marvel fans will surely connect the creature to Hela. The new Thor film will feature the damned queen as a primary antagonist, so it appears Thor will be fighting one of the members in her zombified army. \nThe other behind-the-scene shot gives away fewer details about Thor: Ragnarok . The pictures simply shows director Taika Waititi setting up a shot during filming. \nYou can check out the images in the photo gallery below. The newest synopsis for Thor: Ragnarok can also be read as well: \nIn Thor: Ragnarok , Thor (Hemsworth) is imprisoned on the other side of the universe without his mighty hammer and finds himself in a race against time to get back to Asgard to stop Ragnarok – the destruction of his homeworld and the end of Asgardian civilization – at the hands of an all-powerful new threat, the ruthless Hela (Blanchett). But first he must survive a deadly gladatorial contest that pits him against his former ally and fellow Avenger – The Incredible Hulk!” \nMORE THOR: Hulk vs Thor Concept Art / Concept Art of Cate Blanchett's Hela / Thor Ragnarok: Who Is Hela? / 5 Planet Hulk Easter Eggs We Need in Ragnarok (Photo: Facebook/Chris Hemsworth BR) \nThor: Ragnarok , the third installment of Marvel’s popular Norse Super Hero, is directed by filmmaker Taika Waititi.
