Among other things, the rules required coal companies to conduct extensive monitoring of any waterways that potentially could be impacted by mining operations. Those companies also would be required to return any body of water to pre-mining condition and then continue to monitor the quality of that water for years into the future — efforts that were estimated to cost the industry $81 million per year, according to federal estimates. \nAt a bill-signing ceremony in the Oval Office Thursday, the president called the regulations “another terrible job-killing rule.” \n“In eliminating this rule, I am continuing to keep my promise to the American people to get rid of wasteful regulations that do absolutely nothing but slow down the economy, hamstring companies, push jobs to other countries,” he said while surrounded by lawmakers and coal miners. \nThe legislation has at least some bipartisan support. Sen. Joe Manchin, West Virginia Democrat, was present at Thursday’s event and has urged Mr. Trump to roll back Obama-era regulations on the coal industry. \nIn undoing the rule, Congress used a little-known provision known as the Congressional Review Act, which allows lawmakers to undo regulations put in place during the final months of an administration. Under the law, Obama administration regulations dating back to June 2016 can be undone by Congress.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T04:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:54:37.355+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
