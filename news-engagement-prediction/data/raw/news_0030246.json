'I don't know what's going to happen or how long it'll stay, but I'm feeling positive.'\nVikki Webb, 25, from Surrey pictured after her sister Sam shaved her head. Her hair started falling out two years ago but it's started growing back since she quit her job to go travelling\nVikki in Orlando, Florida, in June 2011 before she started losing her hair\nIn addition to the demands of her job, Vikki was also left feeling stressed by a break in at her family home and four days later her hair started falling out.\nAfter a week of her hair falling into her hands- mainly from the back and sides- she went to see her GP, who put it down to stress. But a month later, the problem continued.\nShe went back to the GP, who made the same diagnosis, leaving her feeling 'hopeless'.\nAfter weeks of waking up to hair all over her pillow, Vikki asked her now 30-year-old sister Sam Webb, to shave her head bald.\nVikki was alarmed when her hair started falling out in huge clumps in November 2013\nVikki (left) with her sister Jess, travelling around Thailand, in January 2017\n'It was devastating, surreal and emotional going bald- especially as a female- but I'd had enough,' Vikki said. 'Seeing it fall out at such an alarming rate was awful, so I just felt relieved when it was all gone.'\nNext, Vikki lost all her body hair and eyelashes, which she explained made her feel less feminine.\nIn May 2014, she was diagnosed with alopecia universalis - the complete loss of hair on the scalp and body - at Croydon University Hospital, south London.\nVikki (second from left) with her sisters Alana, Sam and Jess. At first strangers would stare at her bald head on nights out but now she doesn't let it bother her\nVikki with her boyfriend Liam, in May 2016. She credits him with giving her more confidence and says he's never been fazed by her hair loss\nVikki with her boyfriend Liam, in July 2016 while having steroid treatment to help her hair grown back\nVikki was told there was no cure but that steroids may help her hair grow back.\nShe said: 'I thought I'd mentally prepared myself for it, as I'd researched online and knew I had alopecia, but as soon as they said it I broke down.\n'I didn't know if I'd ever get my hair back.'\nVikki was given steroids for six weeks which helped a tiny proportion of her hair to grow back, but as soon as she finished her course, it fell out again.\nVikki in August 2016. Steroid treatment had some effect but didn't make her hair grow back completely\nVikki, showing hair regrowth, in January 2017. She now has the most hair she's had for three years\nDecember 2013: The back of Vikki's head after her locks first started to fall out\nThe same thing happened again after a repeat course of steroids in December 2014.\n'I was so disappointed,' Vikki said. 'I had to accept there was nothing they could do but monitor my progress.' Wearing a wig was itchy and uncomfortable, so she decided to embrace her bald head, feeling strengthened by the support of her parents, her sisters - Jess, Alana, 32, and Sam - and boyfriend Liam Francis, 25.\nVikki, who is documenting her progress on Instagram , said: 'I've been with Liam for eight years and he helped me feel more confident, because he was not fazed by it at all.\nThe 25-year-old occasionally wears a wig but prefers not to as she finds them itchy and uncomfortable\nVicky's hair and eyelashes are now starting to grow back after she quit her day job to go travelling\nVikki (right) with her sister Jess, at a friend's wedding, in June 2012, a year before her hair loss\n'Everyone knows me with a bald head now; I don't hide it.\n'It does ruin my night when people stare or approach me and ask what's wrong, but I just crack on with it.'\nBut amazingly, after a six week course of steroids from November to December 2016, Vikki's hair started growing on the sides of her head.\nThis time it continued to grow even as the medication was out of her system.\nLeft to right: Vikki with her sisters Jess, Alana and Sam, and friends Hayley and Sarah, after taking part in a charity run, in June 2015, to raise money for Alopecia UK\nVikki with her supportive boyfriend Liam who she has bee with for eight years\nVikki (middle right) with her sisters Jess and Sam, mum Gay, sister Alana and dad Alan, out for dinner, in summer 2015\nThen in December she decided she'd pursue her life-long ambition of going travelling, while still young and commitment free.\n'I've got fluffy hair at the sides and at the back it's quite thick. I'm so happy I've got my eyelashes back. This is the most hair I've had in three years,' she said.\n'The burglary really affected me. I wouldn't go out on my own, I couldn't really sleep; I was a mess.\n'But I think quitting my job and being away is the best thing for me. My friends say unemployment has been my cure.'", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=", "https://www.instagram.com/alopecia_journey91/"], "published": "2017-02-13T10:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T12:33:43.207+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
