The United States Army helps to train and equip Ukrainian soldiers, who are fighting Russian-backed separatists in two eastern provinces of Ukraine, in the only active war in Europe today . In the latest outbreak, the sides vied for control of what are known as “gray zone” territories, areas between the front lines that had previously been in buffer zones.

European monitors reported heavy shelling of Avdiivka since Sunday. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.
