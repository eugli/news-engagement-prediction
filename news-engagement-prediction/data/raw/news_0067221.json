On Friday, some attendees at CPAC, the annual Conservative Political Action conference, waved tiny flags that appear to be exactly copies of the Russian flag, however these have the word \"Trump\" emblazoned on them. \nCPAC staff quickly went around and confiscated those flags so please, stop worrying America, there's clearly no pattern. Go home and find those leakers !\nSEE ALSO: What to do when you're so overwhelmed by the Trump presidency you can barely move \nThe difference between the Russian flag and these Trump flags is profound.\n \nRussian flag on left.

In 2015, just 13 percent approved of what he's going. In 2017, that number climbed to 22 percent.\nTrump has come under fire in recent weeks after a bombshell report from the New York Times alleged that the President's aides had frequent contact with Russian intelligence officials throughout his campaign.\nNothing to see here folks. Move right along.\nBONUS: Here's a clip of Kellyanne Conway's previous (and mercifully brief) career in stand-up comedy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T03:39:10.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
