Its silky curves emboldened by that familiar carbon-fiber pattering, drenched in an inky blue. It’s roof now cut and open so you can show yourself wearing your Roadster with pride.

CEO Horacio Pagani called this car the most complicated project they’ve ever worked on, and it does seem complicated in no bad way. \nThe Huayra Roadster keeps the 7-speed sequential gearbox and the Mercedes-AMG sourced 6.0 liter twin-turbo V12. It gets a boost in power over the normal coupe, now at 754 horsepower and 738 ft-lb of torque. The normal Huayra gets from zero to 60 in 2.8 seconds, but there’s no official claim yet for the roadster. It does shed about 70kg in weight, though.
