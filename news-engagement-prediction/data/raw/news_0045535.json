The loss condemned the Australian world No.31 to his third first round loss out of four tournaments in 2017, with his only wins coming in the first and second rounds of the Australian Open. Bernard Tomic of Australia.   \nTomic began the year with a straight-sets loss to Spanish veteran David Ferrer in Brisbane and last week lost to world No.140 Barbadian Darian King 6-4 6-4 in the first round of the Memphis Open. \nIt wasn’t all bad news for Tomic though, it was also announced he is playing doubles with Australian Open finalist Rafael Nadal in Indian Wells, in March. And spending time with the Spanish great on the court could be just what he needs to get his season going. \nAs for Darcis — the recent hero of Belgium’s Davis Cup win over Germany after beating both Phillipp Kohlschriber and Alexander Zverev — he awaits either Memphis finalist Nikoloz Basilashvili or German veteran Tommy Haas. While Tomic suffered a bad day on court there were no such troubles for either Milos Raonic or Jack Sock. \nTop seed Raonic powered his way to a 6-1 6-4 win over American qualifier Tim Smyczek, belting down 10 aces in the process. \nSock, the world No.21 took a bit longer to progress but did so with a straight sets win over Moldova’s Radu Albot 6-4 7-6 (7-2).
