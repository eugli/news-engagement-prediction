Pradhan, however, rejected the allegation and said “I know that woman. I have helped the woman as her parents have died. The allegation against me is politically motivated.” \n“It is a conspiracy against me,” Pradhan claimed while the woman alleged that the MLA has torturing her physically and mentally, threatening her not to disclose the matter. \n“I met Braja Kishore in 2014. After staying together for few days, we decided to marry at a temple. Now he is neither giving me the status of his wife nor staying with me after our marriage. He takes me to his Bhubaneswar residence, but has never taken me to his house in Talcher,” the woman alleged. \n“I have all proof of getting married to him at a temple.
