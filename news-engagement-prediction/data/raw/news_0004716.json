The season also calls for cocktails. But then again, which seasons don’t? Perfumers Alia Raza and Ezra Woods, the perfumers behind the Los Angeles–based perfumery Régime des Fleurs and renowned cocktalier Arley Marks and Michael Blum, the head bartender of L.A.’s Bar Stella had those images in mind when they formulated their concoctions. Here are four cocktails meant to evoke the spirit of winter through scent, taste, and appearance. Like the fragrances that Raza and Woods create by hand, the following cocktails are comprised of unique ingredients and inspired by history, culture, architecture, and environmental elements—and sure to give you that hygge , even if you live in the type of place where winter is just a state of mind.
