Here are the latest updates. IndiaToday.in | Posted by Bijin Jose A + A - E Palaniswami \nThe stage is set for Tamil Nadu Chief Minister E Palaniswami to prove the majority of his government today. The Assembly goes for the trust vote at 11 am. Palaniswami, who was sworn in as Chief Minister on February 16, was given 15 days time by governor in-charge C Vidyasagar Rao to prove his majority. However, he decided to seek the vote of confidence on Saturday. It is believed that he is seeking early trust vote so that the MLAs supporting him doesn't change their mind. \nPalaniswami has claimed the support of as many as 125 out of 135 AIADMK MLAs. \nIf all the 234 MLAs remain present during the time of voting, Palaniswami will need 118 votes to prove his majority. He will be in trouble if even seven of the 124 MLAs change their mind during voting. \nMeanwhile, Panneerselvam urged AIADMK MLAs to vote against the vote of confidence sought by Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, stating they should not aid a \"family rule\" and supporting the motion would amount to betraying late party chief Jayalalithaa and people who voted for party. \nHERE ARE THE LIVE UPDATES: Palaniswami reaches secretariat Amma's legacy rests on abled shlders of OPS, this will be driving force to vote, not temporary confinement of brainwashing: M Pandiarajan Barricading, Heavy police deployment outside TN secretariat ahead of floor test We don't think we are in single digit.
