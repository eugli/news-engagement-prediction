The arrived to find a 1996 Toyota Corolla upside down in a creek that runs alongside Highland Road and the driver already pulled from the vehicle. \nThe driver, a 20-year-old male, had been traveling east on Highland Road and lost control while negotiating a curve in the roadway. The Toyota flew off the roadway and landed on its roof in a creek that was filled with about three feet of water from recent heavy rains. Highland Road crash (Dublin CHP) \nTwo area residents, Dan Rich and Clayton Wiedemann, heard the accident nearby. \nThey quickly ran the scene of the crash, where they spotted the Toyota upside down in the creek with almost the entire passenger compartment submerged under water. \n“As soon as I got here the car was upside down in the creek and it looked pretty serious,” said Wiedemann. \n“It was all timing, It was just fortunate that we were here,” said Rich. \nSensing the danger to the driver, Wiedemann moved into action. \n“Clayton dives in there, under the creek, inside the car full of water,” explained Rich. “That’s what this character did.” \nRich also lent a hand, grabbing a pick ax from his truck and shattering the rear window of the Toyota as Wiedemann managed to pull out the driver to safety. \n“Just started wrenching on the door to get it open. I heard someone banging at the door,” remembered Wiedemann. \n“I could see a hand trying to hit the window, but he was under water. So I took the pick ax and put it through the window,” said Rich. “Like Clayton says, we took a chance because we might have hurt him. But we had to get him out.” \nThe driver sustained only minor injuries in the crash, a fact the CHP credited the quick actions of the heroic Good Samaritan. \n“He was lucky. Obviously, there were two people willing to risk their lives to save his,” said CHP Officer Derek Reed. \nWhen KPIX 5 Juliette Goodrich called the two men heroes, Rich and Wiedemann said that wasn’t how they considered themselves. \n“I don’t know. Are you a hero?” Rich asked Wiedemann with a smile on his face. “I think anybody would have did it.” \nThe victim in the crash is already out of the hospital and is expected to recover from his minor injuries. \nJuliette Goodrich facebook Follow Emmy award winning reporter and Bay Area native Juliette Goodrich joined KPIX 5 in 1997 and has performed a variety of anchoring and reporting assignments during her time with the station.
