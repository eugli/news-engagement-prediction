(Photo: USA Today Sports Images) \nMichigan State hosts Wisconsin on Sunday for what is a huge game for the Spartans. \nAlong with it being Senior Day, MSU will be looking for a signature win to put on its resume as it tries to solidify a spot in the NCAA Tournament. \nAside from all that, it will also be a reunion for a family that's been good to Michigan State and now also Wisconsin. \nD'Mitrik Trice is a point guard for the Badgers who's having a solid freshman season. Playing 17.8 minutes per game, Trice is averaging six points, two rebounds and 1.6 assists while shooting 36 percent from 3-point range. His older brother Travis, of course, was a fantastic four-year player for the Spartans. As a senior, he averaged 15.3 points and 5.1 assists per game while helping lead Michigan State to the Final Four. \nAccording to the younger Trice, the whole family, including Travis, will be at Breslin Center for Sunday's showdown. \nIt's goin to be the 1st time in 6 months my whole family gonna be together @MamaJu_125 @trice_travis @TriceOlivia @isaiah_trice22 @Ttrice20 â€” D'Mitrik Trice (@DMitrikTrice22) February 25, 2017 \nSince graduating from Michigan State, Travis Trice has been carving out a nice pro career, playing in the NBA's Development League and overseas. He played this past season with Cairns Taipans of the National Basketball League, which includes teams from Australia and New Zealand. Averaging 14.6 points and 3.5 assists per game, Trice was named team MVP earlier this month for Cairns Taipans, which bowed out of the playoffs this week. While Trice certainly would have liked to be playing for the NBL championship, the loss made it possible for the former MSU guard to come to East Lansing this weekend. \nThat begs the question, though, is he cheering for the Spartans or Badgers on Sunday?
