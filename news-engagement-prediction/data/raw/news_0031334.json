I personally feel it’s healthy if you don’t,” she says.

And that’s why a number of family members have or are set to team up on various films. So, if Akshay Kumar will work in his wife Twinkle Khanna’s maiden production venture in Padman, Hrithik Roshan has successfully teamed up again with his father, Rakesh Roshan (as producer) in Kaabil. \nLoads of freedom \n“When I work with dad, I know I can be absolutely free to set the highest benchmark because I know the producer is behind me. I know that he will not stop me from doing whatever it takes to achieve the benchmark I have set in my head,” says Hrithik, who will also be seen working with his father in Krrish 4 too. Anil Kapoor’s daughters, Sonam Kapoor and Rhea Kapoor will work together in Veere Di Wedding. (HT Photo) \nThe coming days will also see sisters, Sonam Kapoor and Rhea Kapoor working together on a home production, Veere Di Wedding. Also, Anushka Sharma is teaming up again (after NH10; 2015) with her brother, Karnesh Sharma (producer) on their upcoming venture, Phillauri. \nWatch Phillauri trailer \nComfort level Anushka Sharma is teaming up with her brother, Karnesh Sharma in Phillauri. (HTPhoto) \n“When you have to speak to somebody from your workspace, you’ll be tactful. But with your sibling, you talk with no holds barred. Karnesh and I have never had different opinions. Our approaches may differ, but our final result is the same. In our case, he is my best friend,” says Anushka. Karnesh feels since “there’s trust”, they “can trust each other blindly” even though there might be some issues. \nExperts also feel that working with family members is “surely a big advantage.” Says trade analyst Taran Adarsh: “First, there is a huge comfort level. Plus, when an actor, especially an A-list star, works in a home production, he/she can choose a script and director etc. on their own. Also, there’s a lot of creative freedom, and even from the economics point of view, it’s a win-win situation.” Varun Dhawan and David Dhawan will work together on Judwaa 2. (HT Photo) \nInterestingly, Varun Dhawan, who is teaming up with his father David Dhawan for Judwaa 2 (after working together on Main Tera Hero; 2014), says he is “absolutely ready” to work with his father. “I was dying to start working with him. We have been preparing for months. For some reason, I feel like it’s my first film,” says Varun. Dhawan Sr adds, “Even though I have done so much work, I feel like it’s my first film.” \nChoices galore \nIn the coming months, Salman Khan will team up again with his brother, Arbaaz Khan, for Dabangg 3. Rumours are rife that Aamir Khan will collaborate with his wife, Kiran Rao again, after Dhobi Ghat (2010). \nAnd, Alia Bhatt’s sister, Shaheen Bhatt, is writing the script for Aashiqui 3, which might star Alia and Sidharth Malhotra. “Shaheen is such a talented writer. I am waiting for her to write her own film. She is funny and witty, but at the same time, she is simple,” says Alia, adding that her sister is the “only genius” in the Bhatt family. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T02:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:33:12.891+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
