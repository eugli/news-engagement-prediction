Pearl is a bright red \"cellphone hotel.\"\nStudents are required to either check their smartphone into the hotel during class time, or keep it out of sight in their bag or locker.\nThe 40 phone-sized pockets are right next to a power bar for chargers, and it's in full view of the entire class so everyone can keep an eye on it â€” and the devices inside.\nOttawa teacher believes in balanced use of cellphones in classrooms Halifax-area school bans cellphones to boost art of conversation \"It does create anxiety, there's a lot of data that students consider private. It's almost for them like someone taking away their diary, they have that connection with it,\" said O'Donel's principal Michelle Clemens.\nThe measure was put in place in September in an attempt to deal with the problem of distracted students and falling grades.\nMichelle Clemens says the whole tone of the building is more positive since the cellphone hotels were introduced in September. (Submitted)\n\"We had found that our engagement was slipping over the past few years, and marks were slipping, and students weren't doing as well as they could be doing or should be doing,\" said Clemens.\nSince the cellphone hotel was introduced, there has been a significant improvement in grades.\n'I'm certainly thrilled about the improvement.' - Michelle Clemens Clemens said currently 66 per cent of Grade 12 students are on the honour roll, up from 60 per cent last year.\nGrade 11 students have seen a two per cent increase, and 70 per cent of Grade 10 students are achieving average grades of 75 per cent or higher.\n\"Is it exclusively because of a change in the cellphone procedure? Well, we can't say for certain but I'm certainly thrilled about the improvement,\" Clemens told CBC Radio's St. John's Morning Show .\nPressure drop When you take away access to the smart phone, you also take away the pressure some students feel to constantly be connected.\n\"When you have heart-to-heart chats with students, for the most part there was a lot of social pressure for them to be texting and responding to texts in class,\" said Clemens.\n\"So if you have this more strident policy then it also gives permission for the student not to be texting, not to be engaging in other activities.\"\nSmartphones are allowed only for school work, and only if the teacher gives permission. (Sean Gallup/Getty Images)\nSmartphones are only allowed to be used in class for school work, and only when the teacher gives permission. The consequences for breaking the rules are strictly enforced.\n\"If you are using it for text messaging purposes, or not on task, then you and your cellphone come to the office and we call home and we have your parent come and collect you and your phone.\"\nSubsequent offences will result in suspension and loss of privilege to bring phones to school.\nPractice what you teach Students aren't the only ones distracted by the siren call of the smartphone.\nClemens set up a cellphone hotel at the first staff meeting of the year, and she said teachers are under the same obligation to focus on what's happening in the classroom.\nO'Donel teachers are also asked to leave their phones at the door during meetings. (NISEP)\n\"We also say to our teachers when we're in the instruction mode to show that respect and have your cellphone out of sight, and that's our procedure and that's our policy,\" said Clemens.\n\"Does it happen all the time with everybody? I wouldn't be able to swear to it, but it doesn't happen all the time with anybody, anywhere, but we're working on it.\"\nWith files from the St. John's Morning Show", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T04:22:38.443+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
