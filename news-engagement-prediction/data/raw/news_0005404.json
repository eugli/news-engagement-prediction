Article continues below \nThere are still plenty of opponents on the current roster that could have incredible feuds and matches with Styles, such as Seth Rollins and Finn Balor from the rival brand. \nBut the former WWE Champion has his sights firmly set on one opponent, Randy Orton. THE PHENOMENAL ONE VS. THE VIPER \nOrton gets his guaranteed title match at WrestleMania after winning the Royal Rumble, but speaking to Chad Dukes Versus The World before Sunday’s pay-per-view, he explained how it will be special when he finally meets The Viper. \nHe said: “Well, I think there’s that one person that everybody would like to see me work with, and that’s Randy Orton. \n“Randy and I have yet to even touch in the ring. \n“I don’t think I’ve hit him with anything, or he’s hit me. None of that’s ever happened. \n“I think that’s gonna be special when it does.” \nIf those rumours are true that Styles could be a Raw superstar as the year progresses, then maybe WWE need to pull out all the stops to make sure SmackDown Live gets an incredible feud between the pair. \nAfter all, both have been vocal about wanting the match for many months. \nWould you like to see a feud between Randy Orton and AJ Styles?
