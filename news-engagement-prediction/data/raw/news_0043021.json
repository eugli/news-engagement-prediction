While Game of Thrones is known for filming in various locations throughout Europe, the Calgary location is less well-known. \n@Maisie_Williams Thanks for shooting part of GOT in Canada and supporting our economy! My friend Kelly is ecstatic to have met you tonight  pic.twitter.com/jDT7wrgM0u — Stock:WiZARD (@stockwizardINC) February 18, 2017 \nTypically, Calgary is where Game of Thrones films wolves against a green screen so that they can be turned into direwolves. As Watchers on the Wall reports, certain Instagram posts from Instinct, a company that handles animals for films, suggest this may be what Williams is involved with. \nThe Instagram posts show two wolves. The white wolf is Quigley, which is the wolf used to play Ghost, Jon Snow’s wolf, since 2015. The second is a newcomer to the show, but since all of the other direwolves are dead, it is easy to speculate that this wolf will play Nymeria, Arya’s wolf who was sent off into the forest after biting Joffrey. \nNymeria has been mostly forgotten by Game of Thrones , but she keeps popping up in the show’s source material, George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels. After being sent away, Nymeria amassed a giant wolf pack that roams Westeros and feeds on the flesh of men. Arya is also shown to have some warg abilities, as she is able to see through Nymeria’s eyes in dreams. During one of these dreams, Arya sees the corpse of her mother, Catelyn Stark, floating in a river and Nymeria drags the body to shore. \nMore Game of Thrones : Sophie Turner Reveals Possible Spoiler / Dragons Return In New Set Photos / New Story Details Revealed By George R.R. Martin \nIn the most recent A Song of Ice and Fire novel, A Dance with Dragon , Ghost encounters Nymeria and her hundred-strong wolf pack. Perhaps this scene is being recreated in Calgary. If Williams is also there, then perhaps that means Arya will be reunited with her wolf, or perhaps even with Ghost and Jon Snow, though there have been no reported sightings of Kit Harrington in Calgary. \nThere is also still the question of whether Nymeria’s wolf pack storyline, which still has not come to a head in Martin’s novels, will be referenced Game of Thrones at all . \nGame of Thrones Season 7 will air on HBO in summer 2017.
