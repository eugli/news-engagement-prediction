Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., told NY1 about appellate judge Neil Gorsuch's nomination on Tuesday.\nGillibrand said her colleagues should \"vote their conscience\" in light of the judge's \"ultra-right-wing conservative\" views.\n\"I hope we do vote him down. But make no mistake: If we do hold the line with 60 votes, Mitch McConnell will change the rules the next day,\" Gillibrand said.\nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox.\nSorry, there was a problem processing your email signup.

So it likely will be 51 votes, regardless, at any given time that a nominee is blocked.\"\nTrump has told Senate Republicans to use the \"nuclear option\" to ram the Colorado judge through the confirmation process.
