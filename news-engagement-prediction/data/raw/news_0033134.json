Flynn’s resignation came after a whirlwind weekend of breaking news about his possible phone calls with Russian officials, shocking just about everyone. \nNo one would have guessed Flynn would be first to go, so let’s try to guess who will be second. Will it be Kellyanne Conway of “ alternative facts ,”“ Bowling Green Massacre ,” and “ General Flynn does enjoy the full confidence of the President ” fame? Will it be Sean Spicer , whose stuttering and blame-shifting have earned him lampooning by GQ and Saturday Night Live ? Maybe someone else? \nVote now! \nThe poll will stay open until tomorrow evening at 6 EST! \n[image via screengrab] \nHave a tip we should know?
