Photo: Supplied \nNelly Robinson, the owner of Nel Restaurant in Sydney's CBD, makes no apologies for charging $150 per person in a no-show booking, and attributes the policy to a reduction in no-show diners. \n\"We have been on board with this from day one,\" he said. \n\"If you don't turn up to a table, never mind the food and labour costs ... what about the people on the waitlist that have birthdays and celebrations and we can't fit them in? That's the thing that really gets me.\" \nMr Robinson estimates annual losses of $31,000 at his establishment if just two tables a week fail to show up. \n\"We had to charge somebody last week on Valentine's Day. This guy decided on the day he wouldn't come... he said he would speak to his wife and ring back to reschedule, but he never called back, so we charged him,\" Mr Robinson said. \n\"If someone has a family bereavement or emergency, we will move the booking to a later date ... we have a heart. But if they choose to cancel completely they will be charged.\" \nThe top excuses Mr Robinson receives for booking cancellations at nel. Restaurant include \"we've booked two restaurants as we couldn't decide and now we'd like to cancel...\", and, \"I've just been called into a last minute meeting.\" \nHe's also been told, \"I'm at Wentworth Avenue in Parramatta\" (Nel is on Wentworth Avenue in Sydney's CBD), and, \"both my partner and I booked for the same night.\" \nHowever the excuse that took the cake was, \"I broke my kneecap on the way to our reservation\" â€“ which he said was in fact genuine. \nDimmi founder and chief executive Stevan Premutico described no-shows as \"one of the biggest issues impacting the restaurant industry\". \n\"We are doing our bit to try and eradicate no-shows completely by 2020.\" \nMr Premutico said the industry had shown an \"overwhelmingly positive\" response to the blacklist system. \n\"If someone is a no-show, they will be added to the list ... however, the restaurant can choose to override that,\" he said. \n\"Consumers in Australia don't typically 'no-show' with malice or bad intention. I just don't think they realise the impact it has.\" \nMr Premutico said that 24 hours' notice was common courtesy for patrons to cancel a restaurant, however four hours was still sufficient to enable an establishment to re-book a table. \nIn data shared exclusively with Fairfax Media last year, Dimmi reported that the most common no-shows in Australia lived in the postcodes 2000 (Sydney), 4217 (Surfers Paradise), 3000 (Melbourne) and 2010 (Darlinghurst/Surry Hills). \nThe gender split of no-show diners was 54 per cent female and 46 per cent male.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T11:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T07:01:48.252+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
