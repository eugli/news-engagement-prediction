A Pakistani national, identified as A.A, stood trial in the court, accused of spying in favour of the Embassy of Pakistan in the UAE and divulging secret information about a local telecommunication company. The defence lawyer told the court that his client did not mean to divulge confidential information about the company he was working for. \"He was just exchanging information with some employees of the Pakistan embassy, who were intelligence officers of the Pakistani Embassy to the UAE. He thought that they were ordinary and unimportant information. \"My client did it on good faith. He was not aware of the fact that the information he shared with the embassy staff was much classified and confidential,\" the lawyer said. A ruling is expected on March 15.
