Not me!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 3 February 2017 M r Trump responded to the January 29 missile test by saying Iran was \"playing with fire\" and imposed fresh sanctions on individuals, some of them linked to Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard.\nThe missile test was not a direct breach of Iran's 2015 nuclear pact with six world powers, but the White House said it \"violated the spirit of that\"..\nLast night Mr Trump's spokesman Sean Spicer re-iterated his firm stance.\n\"I think the Ayatollah is going to realise there's a new president in office,\" Mr Spicer said.\n\"This president's not going to sit by and let Iran flout its violations, or its apparent violations, to the joint agreement, but he will continue to take action as he sees fit.\n\"The president has also made clear time and time again that he's not going to project what those actions will be, and he's not going to take anything off the table. \nBut I think Iran is kidding itself if they don't realise there's a new president in town.\"\nMr Trump was also facing a legal showdown over his travel and refugee ban and vowed to take it all the way to the US Supreme Court if necessary.\nWatch | Sean Spicer says Donald Trump confident his travel ban will be restored 03:27 H e said: \"We’re going to take it through the system.

And then we’re not allowed to be tough on the people coming in? Explain that one.\"\nMr Trump added: \"It's common sense. Some things are law, I'm all in favour of that. Some things are common sense, and this is common sense. And a lot of people agree with us, believe me.\" \nJust cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril.
