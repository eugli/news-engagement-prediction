The party’s MPs were violently removed from the House. The DA walked out shortly afterward.\nSave SA said the country needed a president who could articulate concrete measures to address high levels of inequality and the lack of progress in developing an inclusive economy, and do so urgently.\nAs it happened: Another dramatic #SONA as chaos erupts inside and outside Parliament\n'Crisis in Parliament'\nZuma’s previous attempts to do so had culminated in state capture.\n\"Consequently his new wish list must be treated with the scepticism that it will once again be a vehicle to benefit his cronies. State resources amounting to R1.4 trillion are at stake.\"\nZuma had failed to assure the nation that he was concerned about corruption or taking steps to deal with it.\nEven though Zuma had concerns about former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela’s recommendations in her State of Capture report, he could still have made a commitment to get to the bottom of the questions it raised, the organisation said.\n\"His failure to acknowledge issues raised by the Public Protector meant he was unable to deal with concerns raised by opposition MPs about his legitimacy. Instead, he contributed to the crisis in Parliament.\"\nThe organisation criticised National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete and NCOP chairperson Thandi Modise for declining the DA’s request for a moment of silence to honour the 94 Health Esidimeni patients who died after being transferred to unlicensed NGOs.\n'Tired, empty speech'\nIt would have been the right thing to do, as ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe had pointed out.\nWhen Zuma eventually took to the podium after the EFF MPs were thrown out, he did his trade-mark giggle. This was confirmation of Save SA’s assertion that he was cold, emotionless, and cruel.\n\"It was business as usual: A tired, empty speech that typified his lame-duck presidency.\"\nThe country deserved a better president, one who would provide solutions to its problems. Intensified and united civil society action was essential to fast-track Zuma’s departure.\n\"This man must go, before he causes even further damage.”\nThe organisation called on people to add their voices to the call to remove Zuma by demonstrating and signing the People’s Motion of No Confidence .", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/News24/SouthAfrica/Articles&sz=600x50&c=1650367987&t=artid%3d94ac2f9d-78bc-4ba5-a95f-61c1a525104c%26Companies%3dsave+sa%26People%3djacob+zuma%26Topics%3dpolitics%2csona+2017%26accreditation%3dnews24%26posno%3d1", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/News24/SouthAfrica/Articles&sz=600x50&c=1650367987&t=artid%3d94ac2f9d-78bc-4ba5-a95f-61c1a525104c%26Companies%3dsave+sa%26People%3djacob+zuma%26Topics%3dpolitics%2csona+2017%26accreditation%3dnews24%26posno%3d1", "http://thepeoplesmotion.org.za/"], "published": "2017-02-10T17:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T02:12:28.564+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
