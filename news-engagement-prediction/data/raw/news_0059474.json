She died in the US last week surrounded by family and friends. \nLiz Smith is being hailed by many as a legend, as she managed to troll Donald Trump from beyond the grave. \nThe death of the 87-year-old grandmother from Connecticut was announced in a touching newspaper obituary, which included a subtle dig at the new US President. \nIt read: “She enjoyed travelling, especially to Yellowstone Park and heli-hiking in the Canadian Rockies, white water rafting on the New River in West Virginia and the Snake River in Idaho, Orient Express trip from Vienna to Paris, entire tour of Nova Scotia including Cape Breton. \n“Liz is smiling now, not to be living during the Trump Presidency.” \nAs one Twitter user eloquently put it, “dead and still awesome”. 87-Year-Old Woman Trolls Trump From The Grave With Her Obituary - The Huffington Post - Dead and still awesome. https://t.co/HvsNjCZ72o — fraudfeasor (@fraudfeasor) February 18, 2017 \nThe lifelong scout member is not the first person to include the controversial 45th president in her obituary. \nIn the midst of the presidential campaign last year, an American woman’s family wrote another entertaining death notice. \n“Faced with the prospect of voting either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, Mary Anne Noland of Richmond chose, instead, to pass into the eternal love of God on Sunday.” President Donald Trump is getting a shout-out in a number of obituaries. Picture: AP Source: AP \nMary’s sons said they wrote the opening line to carry on their mother’s excellent sense of humour. \nGrandmother Ruth, 86, was another woman who didn’t mince her words when she ended her obituary with a bang. \nIt said: “As stipulated in her will, Ruth wanted to make sure her obituary included this final line. \n‘If you vote for Donald Trump, you seriously must be a f***ing dumb ass’.” On January 14, the world lost a legend. Picture: Imgur Source: imgur \nA picture of the obituary was posted on Imgur and viewed nearly 400,000 times. \nThat same month, Pittsburgh man Jeffrey H. Cohen, who died aged 70 also begged America to think twice about voting for Mr Trump. \nHis obituary, published in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette , described Mr Cohen as a chiropractor with a love of family and cowboy culture whose patients included Liza Minnelli, ‘Weird Al’ Yankovic and the Pittsburgh Steelers. \nIt ended with a final request: “Jeffrey would ask that in lieu of flowers, please do not vote for Donald Trump.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:41:04.664+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
