For fans of the character though, this is a big one. It’s the first female-fronted Marvel film, despite the fact that Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) was featured as a co-lead in Captain America: The Winter Soldier . There has been precious little information out there, including a director, however, we know that Academy Award-winner Brie Larson ( Room ) will play the lead. Larson spoke to IGN while on the press tour for Kong: Skull Island about expectations for the character. \nLarson told the site of her appearance in the film, “ I can’t say anything… I feel like this is a big conversation and every day I have people yelling at me on Twitter like you better have long hair, or you better have a mohawk, or you better wear the helmet, or you better not wear the helmet, so someone’s going to be mad. ” Fans are certainly passionate about getting the look of a character right and Captain Marvel has had more than one. \nLarson also discussed what the character means to her. She said, “ I find it’s really hard for me to condense what she means to me. I was once a young girl and I was confused by what a hero was and what I wanted to be when I grow up and what was important to me. And so, I think it’s so complicated growing up and to attempt to become a symbol of truth and navigating through all the weird questions of growing up feels so, I’m getting emotional just talking about this, it feels so important to me. When it comes to her, I mean just the fact that she can be a bridge between two worlds, that she can go between Earth and space and that her own personal place is in this little area between where Earth ends and space begins and that’s only hers is so moving to me. I’m just inspired. I’ve been so inspired going through the comics and reading them right now. That’s what I’ve been doing on the side.” \nThere are a slew of Marvel films before we see this one. This year alone, we have Guardians of the Galaxy 2 on May 5, Spider-Man: Homecoming on July 7 (which is a co-production with Sony) and Thor: Ragnarok on November 3. It’s certainly possible that we’ll see Carol Danvers in Infinity War next year as well. We’ll just have to wait and see. The Captain Marvel film is being written by Nicole Perlman ( Guardians of the Galaxy ) and Meg LeFauve ( Inside Out ), and will hit theaters on March 8, 2019. Are you guys excited? What expectations do you have of the character? Who would you like to see direct the film?
