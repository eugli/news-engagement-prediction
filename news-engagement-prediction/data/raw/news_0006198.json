Further increases are possible over the coming weeks.\nThe Ministry of Environment recommends the following ice thickness levels when crossing a water body:\nAt least four inches (10 centimetres) thick to walk on Six inches (15 centimetres) to drive a snowmobile or ATV Eight inches (20 centimetres) for a car or light truck 12 inches (30 centimetres) for a heavy truck", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T19:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:27:43.542+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
