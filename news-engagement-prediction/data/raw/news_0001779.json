She's pictured with President Donald Trump during a National African American History Month 'listening session' on Thursday\nShe was seen walking down the stairs after attending church service at St John's Episcopal Church in Washington on January 20, wearing the orthopedic boot with a high heel on the other foot.\nManigault accompanied President Donald Trump on Thursday to a National African American History Month 'listening session'.\nThe session was attended by African-American leaders, including Ben Carson, Trump's nominee to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development - his sole black Cabinet pick.\nLeaders from the NAACP and the National Urban League were not in attendance.\nNeither was Congressional Black Caucus Chairman Cedric Richmond. The Louisiana Democrat said the meeting was a political stunt.\nManigault, who gained national fame for being a combative contestant on the reality show The Apprentice, was appointed her role in the White House last month.\nThe 42-year-old (pictured on Jan 20), who was appointed as the Assistant to the President and Director of Communications for the Office of the Public Liaison, was injured last month\nHer appointment came as little surprise to those who have followed the career of the one-time Apprentice villain, as she has been a long-time vocal supporter of Trump, and even helped in his transition team.\nManigault's position as one of Trump's most prominent African-American supporters during the campaign drew stark criticism.\nShe has said in the past that she stayed close to Trump over the years and served as his campaign's director of African-American outreach after her role on the Apprentice.\nThis is Manigault's second season at the White House.
