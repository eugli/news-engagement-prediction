John Corina. Detectives said the alleged gunman, who is expected to survive, is also a suspect in homicide that occurred in East Los Angeles. They believe he stole a vehicle Sunday morning after killing a man, then drove into Whittier, where he encountered the police.\nThe slain officer was identified as Keith Boyer, a 27-year veteran of the department.\nWhittier Police Chief Jeff Piper broke down in tears recounting Boyer, whom he described as a close friend and beloved member of the department. He said Boyer was a mentor to others in the department and had recently talked about retiring.\nBoyer played in a community band that performed for charity. At the police station, he was known for his sunny, friendly disposition and willingness to lend help and offer advice, the chief said.\n© Sam Gangwer/The Orange County Register via AP Relatives of a slain officer are escorted away from the coroner's van after police officers turned out for a procession of honor at UCI Medical Center in Orange, Calif., Monday, Feb. 20, 2017. “He was the best of the best,” Piper said tearfully during a Monday afternoon news conference. \"This is an unbelievably senseless tragedy.” Detectives said the alleged gunman, who is expected to survive, is also a suspect in homicide that occurred in East Los Angeles.

And we're going to take care of these families and we're going to take care of this police department.”\nInvestigators are still trying to piece together what motive the shooter had to fire on officers and have not interviewed him yet because he is being treated at the hospital, Corina said.\nEmergency responders at the scene performed CPR on a male officer while wheeling him into an ambulance, said Brian Feinzimer, a freelance photojournalist who was at the scene as authorities responded Monday morning.\nAlso visible in the eastbound lanes of Mar Vista Street east of Colima Road was a Whittier police SUV with shattered windows and a suspect who was handcuffed facedown on the pavement, Feinzimer said. The shootout unfolded in a quiet and lushly landscaped neighborhood of suburban tract homes, churches, sports parks and rolling hills.\n© Katie Falkenberg/Los Angeles Times/TNS Members of the Whittier Police Department investigate the scene of an officer-involved shooting in the area of Mar Vista Street and Colima Road Monday, Feb. 20, 2017 in Whittier, Calif. They were dispatched to the scene at 8:04 a.m., according to a Whittier police department watch commander. Near the scene, a woman and young girl dressed in plaid shirts stopped in their SUV and hugged a Whittier police officer at the yellow police tape near the Friendly Hills Country club.\nMonday afternoon, a procession of police vehicles traveled from the hospital, accompanying the slain officer’s body to the Orange County coroner’s office. Their cars were greeted by a line of law enforcement officers who saluted as the procession drove by.\nThe Whittier Police Department has about 128 sworn officers who patrol the cities of Whittier and Santa Fe Springs in southeastern Los Angeles County.\nCity officials invited the public to attend a prayer vigil 6 p.m. Monday at the Whittier Police Department.\nMonday’s shooting marks the third time a police officer in Whittier was slain in the line of duty in the department’s 100-year history. Whittier officers were killed in 1977 and 1979, according to the city.\nBoyer is survived by several children.\nThe lawman also had another life as a drummer. A few times a month for the last two years, he’d drive nearly two hours south to Temecula to play with Mrs. Jones’ Revenge, a classic-rock tribute band that performs at wineries and weddings. He’d split up with his fiancée, who lived in Temecula, but he still came down to make music, band leader Jeff McNeal said.\n“It was probably a nice release for him, with the kind of high-stress work he does,” said McNeal, 57, adding that Boyer’s technical skill as a drummer “elevated” the band.\n“One of the reasons I didn’t initially ask if he wanted to join was I assumed as a cop, he’s probably a Type A personality, he’s gonna want to be in control. But I was totally wrong about that,” McNeal said. “I was afraid we’d have arguments, but he was extremely enthusiastic and very supportive. Probably the easiest guy in the whole band. Always willing to play. He loved the music. It was his passion.”\n“Radar Love” by Golden Earring was one of Boyer’s favorite songs to play, McNeal said.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAn93hX?blobrefkey=1001&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;104&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAn93hX?blobrefkey=104&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;1280&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;720&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;101&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp", "http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/7763c9f6-7a05-4f60-806e-9705be42aae7/86614fc1-2157-41e5-a998-57071c582096.ism/manifest(format=m3u8-aapl)&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6Dp75.img", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;DomainId&quot;:", "http://cbslocal-download.s3.amazonaws.com/anv-playlists/feeds/xml/201.xml&quot;}", "https://web.skype.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAn93hX&lang=en-us&flow_id=33279115-1f5d-49f2-b063-13a0bbefdc2d", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAn93hX?blobrefkey=102&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;640&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;360&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;103&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAn93hX?blobrefkey=103&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;1024&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;576&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;1004&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/7763c9f6-", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA3e1oO.img", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAn93hX?blobrefkey=en-us&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;culture&quot;:&quot;en-us&quot;}", "http://www.latimes.com/", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAn93hX%3focid%3dst&text=2+Police+Officers%2c+Suspect+Struck+By+Gunfire+In+Whittier&original_referer=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAn93hX%3focid%3dst", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAn8TR6.img&quot;}}", "https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAn93hX%3focid%3dsl&title=2+Police+Officers%2c+Suspect+Struck+By+Gunfire+In+Whittier&source=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAn93hX%3focid%3dsl", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBnMzWD.img"], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T10:03:29.214+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
