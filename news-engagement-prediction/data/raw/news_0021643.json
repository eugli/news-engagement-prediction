Manufacturer Northrop Grumman has downplayed the bugs, telling Defense News they are “ are well down the path to meeting all key performance parameters ” and have made “ significant progress in maturing the IBCS capability during 2016 .” \nWhile Northrop Grumman may remain upbeat about IBCS, the Pentagon’s director of Operational Test and Evaluation Office said that the system was found to be “ neither mature nor stable, as evidenced in numerous software problem reports. ” House Armed Services chair says US needs missiles that can reach #Iran , N Korea https://t.co/XKepfuq7AW pic.twitter.com/mq9pawhpp4 — RT America (@RT_America) February 7, 2017 \nIBCS is meant to replace Raytheon’s Patriot, the current system that was also contracted to provide weapons engineering services to Germany, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Netherlands, Qatar, Spain and Taiwan, according to Yahoo Finance.
