By: FE Online | Published: February 23, 2017 4:12 PM Benami Property Transaction Act 2016 is a further amendment of the Benami Property Transaction Act 1988 which is again re-entitled as Prohibition of Benami Property Transaction Act 1988 (PBPT). \nNew Delhi: The Income Tax Department has registered over 230 cases and attached assets worth Rs 55 crore nationwide as part of its post-demonetisation action under the newly-enforced Benami Transactions Act. \nPost demonetisation on November 8 last year, the I-T Department had carried out public advertisements and had warned people against depositing their unaccounted old currency in someone else’s bank account. Such an Act, it had said, would attract criminal charges under the Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988, applicable on both movable and immovable property, said a PTI report. \nYou may also watch: \nBenami Property Transaction Act 2016 is a further amendment of the Benami Property Transaction Act 1988 which is again re-entitled as Prohibition of Benami Property Transaction Act 1988 (PBPT). \nThe amendment Act came into force on 1st November 2016, where violations of the Act, made operational, attract a heavy penalty and rigorous jail term up to seven years. \n“A total of 235 cases and instances have been registered under the said Act by the department till mid-February. Show cause notices for attachment have been issued in 140 cases where benami assets worth Rs 200 crore are involved,” said the PTI report, adding that in 124 cases, benami assets worth more than Rs 55 crore have been provisionally attached till now. \nThe attached assets include deposits in bank accounts, agricultural and other land, flats and jewellery, among others. \nThe decision to slap the stringent provisions of the Benami Transactions Act is being taken after analysing serious cases where the illegalities were blatant and suspect cash was deposited in either benami accounts or Jan Dhan or dormant accounts. \nThe taxman had initiated a nationwide operation to identify suspect bank accounts where huge cash deposits have been made post November 8 when the government demonetised the Rs 500/1000 currency notes. \nOfficials said the Act empowers the taxman to confiscate and prosecute both the depositor and the person whose illegal money he or she has “adjusted” in their account. \n“Such an arrangement where a person deposits old currency of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 in the bank account of another person with an understanding that the account holder shall return his money in new currency, the transaction shall be regarded as benami transaction under the said Act. The person who deposits old currency in the bank account shall be treated as beneficial owner and the person in whose bank account the old currency has been deposited shall be categorised under this law as a benamidar,” a senior tax department official had said earlier. \nIt is to be noted that the I-T Department is the nodal department to enforce the said Act in the country.
