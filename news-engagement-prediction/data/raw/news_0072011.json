(YouTube) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS  57 PM \nAn off-duty Los Angeles police officer annoyed by teens traipsing on his lawn pulled out his gun and fired a shot during a sidewalk scuffle with several minors, authorities said. \nCellphone video of the wild incident shows the unidentified officer struggling to detain a 13-year-old boy he claims threatened him during a verbal confrontation. \nThe backpack-wearing teen is heard proclaiming his innocence and accusing the cop of child abuse as he tries to free himself on the suburban street in Anaheim, Calif., around 2:40 p.m. Tuesday. \nThe teen accuses the officer of hurling a derogatory word at a girl in the group and turning physical over a mistaken belief the teen threatened to \"shoot\" him. \nIn the nearly 9-minute video posted on YouTube, the teen is heard claiming he threatened to \"sue\" the officer, not shoot him, and that it was the officer who \"tackled\" him first. \nWhen another teen barrels into the off-duty cop to help free the first teen, the officer falls backward over a hedge, stands up and pulls a handgun out of his waistband - maintaining his grip on the first teen the entire time. \nA single gunshot rings out as the cop labors to pull the first teen over the hedge with him. \nAbout a dozen teens panic and scatter before several return to see the first teen get back on his feet, unharmed by the firearm. Uniformed Anaheim Police officers arrive moments later and separate the two. \n\"The confrontation began over ongoing issues with juveniles walking across the officer's property,\" Anaheim Police said in a statement Wednesday. \nCops said the 13-year-old boy was booked at Orange County Juvenile Hall for allegedly threatening to shoot the off-duty officer and battery. \nHe was released Wednesday to his mother, according to KTLA. \n\"It's traumatizing for him. He's 13 years old, for God's sake,\" the mom, who was not identified by name, told the station. Cellphone video of the wild incident shows the unidentified officer struggling to detain a 13-year-old boy he claims threatened him during a verbal confrontation. (YouTube) \nThe teen also spoke after his release, telling KTLA it was only the one female teen who was on the cop's lawn before he shouted a profanity at her. \n\"I ran to the street to run away from him, and he got me, and then he like tried to trip me and he kicked me in my testicles. He kicked me twice,\" the teen said after his release. \"He tried to shoot me.\" \nA 15-year-old male also was arrested for assault and battery and was released to his parents, police said. \nThe case will be presented to the Orange County District Attorney's Office when it is completed, cops said. The names of the involved parties were not released. \nPolice acknowledged \"numerous videos\" of the incident were being shared online and said any future decision to file or reject charges \"rests with the district attorney's office and is based on facts and evidence.\" \nLAPD is conducting a separate internal investigation into the actions of the officer, Anaheim Police said. \nThe video posted online led to a flood of calls, police said. \n\"Calling and sending emails to APD voicing your displeasure will not impact the outcome (of the investigation),\" Anaheim Police said in a message posted on Facebook. \nAn Anaheim Police spokesman said the off-duty officer is not facing any charges but remains part of the inquiry. \n\"He did cooperate with the investigation to the point that he came to the station, but he did not provide a voluntary statement, which is his right,\" Sgt. Daron Wyatt told the Daily News. \"Charges have not been filed at this time, and the investigation is ongoing. That goes for all the participants involved, including the officer.\" Join the Conversation:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T08:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:26:07.478+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
