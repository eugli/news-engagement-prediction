The company says that Charter made \"significant commitments\" to New York state as part of the deal with Time Warner Cable to invest in its broadband network, customer service and jobs. \nCharter owns Time Warner Cable and another operator, Bright House. Charter has rebranded its cable TV and broadband services under the name Spectrum. \nRelated: Charter merges with Time Warner Cable \n\"We will continue to invest in our business and deliver the highest quality services to our customers while we defend against these allegations involving Time Warner Cable practices,\" Charter said in the statement. \nBut a spokeswoman for Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said that, despite the rebranding, Charter has not dealt with underlying hardware and network problems. As a result, customers are still experiencing the same problem of \"slower speeds when they're paying for more.\" \nTime Warner Cable was a unit of Time Warner ( TWX ) , the parent company of CNN, until 2009. The two companies are no longer related.
