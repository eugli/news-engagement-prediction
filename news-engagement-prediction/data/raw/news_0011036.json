Get your 30-day Free Trial\nDwayne Bacon wears a determined look during his brilliant performance Sunday vs. Clemson. Melina Vastola/USAToday Sports Images Dwayne Bacon might have been the last to know.\nTeammate Terrance Mann had a feeling it was going to be a special day when Bacon’s first 3-pointer went down in the opening minutes. Mann knew it for sure when Bacon hit his second.\nFreshman C.J. Walker could sense it from the look on Bacon’s face.\nBut it wasn’t until Bacon hit his third 3-pointer of the first half that Florida State’s sophomore swingman felt it himself. The shot clock was winding down and Bacon had to pump-fake to get some separation before letting loose a desperation bomb from the left wing.\n“I kinda knew then it was gonna be a special day,” Bacon said.\nIt would end up being one of the most special performances in Florida State men’s basketball history. Led by Bacon’s career-high tying 29 points, the No. 15 Seminoles blistered Clemson by 48 points, 109-61, Sunday before a Tucker Center crowd of 10,868.\nBacon and his teammates combined to hit 17 3-pointers -- the most by an FSU team in ACC play -- and that was with the Seminoles sitting several starters down the stretch. Bacon played just 26 minutes, but connected on 10 of 14 shots from the field, including 6 of 9 from 3-point range.", "external_links": ["https://res-5.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/kyia5qtwz656awjbolm5)", "https://res-5.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/kyia5qtwz656awjbolm5"], "published": "2017-02-06T02:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T05:55:46.917+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
