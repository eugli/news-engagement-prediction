She told the men she had a wealthy Egyptian grandfather but in order to accept wire transfers from him she needed help paying bank charges, taxes and solicitor fees. Some victims initially transferred money to Derbas to pay for a hotel room, but she never met turned up and offered excuses, including sick relatives and other calamities. Judge Conlon noted Derbas spun an 'intricate web of lies' and possessed a 'talent for impersonation'. At times she posed as other fake family members. A Seven News reporter in a red blazer was knocked to the ground by family members Footage shows male relatives pushing the cameras away after learning her sentence Her lies included that she needed money for her dead mother's funeral, that her son had died of swine flu and that she had lost an unborn child to an abusive ex-partner. 'I love you, can't wait to be with you,' she texted one of her victims. 'I haven't eaten since yesterday.' The court heard Derbas spent the money on cocaine, gambling and building a house. Although some of the victims became suspicious and even reported the scam, Derbas was 'utterly determined' to obtain funds and was capable of regaining their trust. 'How is borrowing money a fraud,' she replied when one of the men questioned her tales. Defence barrister Greg Jones said the 42-year-old worked seven days a week to support four children and also acted as a carer for her mother and brother, who has a mental disability. Derbas pleaded guilty last year to 11 fraud-related offences over the scam which drew in seven victims between 2008 and 2014 She told the men she had a wealthy Egyptian grandfather but in order to accept wire transfers from him she needed help paying bank charges, taxes and solicitor fees 'There has been a substantial change in her life and her environment since these matters,' he said on Thursday. But Judge Conlon said Derbas' deception involved 'calculated cunning and guile', the callous nature of which was highlighted by her willingness to use her mother's death to bleed more money from vulnerable men seeking company. A pre-sentence report revealed she felt an 'adrenaline rush' after her first offence but now experiences depression, extreme embarrassment and shame. NSW Police fraud squad commander Arthur Katsogiannis said the outcome gave victims hope. 'Many of them were embarrassed about the behaviour, however, they did show courage and strength to come forward,' he said. 'In that respect I congratulate them.' Derbas will be eligible for parole in August 2018.
