But among several questionable statements made by Trump at the event, his apparent claim that there was some sort of incident, presumably a terrorist attack, in Sweden “last night,” was perhaps the most perplexing and left numerous observers scratching their heads. \nAgain! I don't know what Donald Trump is talking about, but according to the three main news papers nothing has happened,apart from Melfest. https://t.co/XWzHPSSYaR \n— @sweden / Emma (@sweden) February 19, 2017 \n@sweden the real crime here in Sweden is being committed on a daily basis. Swedes eating pizza with a fork. Pizza massacre, sad! \n— Kitty Stardust (@ElliottBord) February 19, 2017 \nSome internet commenters compared Trump’s reference to Sweden “last night” to his adviser Kellyanne Conway’s earlier reference to the “Bowling Green Massacre,” a non-existent terror attack which Conway apparently made up out of whole cloth . \nWe survivors of the Bowling Green Massacre stand in solidarity with the tragic victims of The Sweden Incident. Oh, the horror. The horror. \n— Comcha Terra (@ComchaTerra) February 19, 2017 \nAt the rally, Trump was delivering a speech in support of his ban on immigrants from Muslim-dominate countries entering the United States. His mention of Sweden came in the context of what he said were the dangers posed by immigrants in European countries. \n“When you look at what’s happening in Germany, when you look at what’s happening last night in Sweden — Sweden!” Trump declared. “Who would believe this? Sweden! They took in large numbers, they’re having problems like they never thought possible.” \nHere’s a video of Trump making his “Sweden” statement. \nJust to reiterate: There was NO terror incident in Sweden last night. But Fox talked about Sweden last night. pic.twitter.com/XtcC4PRiNU \n— Steve Kopack (@SteveKopack) February 19, 2017 \nBut there was no incident in Sweden “last night,” meaning Friday night, February 17. Searches of news media turned up no reference to any sort of violent incident that could be attributed to terrorists or blamed on immigrants in Sweden.

Past statements by Trump have appeared to refer to whatever he had viewed recently on cable TV news, particularly on the Fox News Channel. Some commentators believe that his bizarre reference to a non-existent incident in Sweden may have been the result of Friday night’s airing on Fox News of a segment on the Tucker Carlson program.
