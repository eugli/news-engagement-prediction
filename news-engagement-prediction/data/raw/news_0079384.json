The one hour show, titled “Premier League Download: Tottenham Hotspur - To Dare Is To Do,” was hosted by English NBC commentator and Men in Blazers co-host Roger Bennett, and examined Spurs as a club, diving into its ethos and club culture. The documentary looked a little bit at Spurs’ history, but focused mostly on the present, the club’s ascent from a mid-table side to one competing for Champions League spots and Premier League titles, and the future, including Spurs’ new stadium. NBC has now put the entire show up for streaming in the United States, and you can watch it below. Men in Blazers have been at the forefront of coverage as interest in soccer has exploded in the United States the past few years. And I have to say that while this documentary is obviously made for the American football fan who might not know much about Spurs, it is quite well done. It’s packaged like you’d expect an American sports documentary to be, with lots of goal footage, excellent interviews, and slow-motion pan shots of supporters and players. Moreover, it’s respectful, positive, and hopeful. Bennett does a good job of capturing the essence of what it means to be a Spurs fan, that delicate balance between hope for the future and inevitable disappointment. It wouldn’t at all surprise me if Tottenham end up with a few new American supporters after watching this. The NBC video is for US audiences only, but for our UK readers, you can watch the entire documentary on Tottenham Hotspur’s website .
