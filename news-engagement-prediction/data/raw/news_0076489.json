(Twitter: Sam Willoughby (@SW91)) \nThe 25-year-old has recently started rehabilitation with personal trainer Eric Harness, who also helped Australian snowboarder Josh Wood get back on his feet and walk again after he suffered a spinal cord injury in 2000. \n\"Mentally, he's amazed me with his strength, sure he's had a couple of moments but we all have moments everyday ... and his moments don't last,\" his father said. \n\"His positiveness is just amazing; I just don't know how he can be as strong as he is with it. \n\"I think being back in his own environment and his own house has really helped; he just goes at it that hard that the PT has to sometimes tell him to back off because he'll make himself too tired.\" \nMr Willoughby said his son was \"over the moon\" with the support from Australians and hoped to return to Adelaide for a visit later this year. Fundraising for 'all-round nice guy' \nHis Road2Recovery Foundation has already raised more than $248,000 and Tourism Minister Leon Bignell hoped money raised from the hot lap auction would tip it past the $250,000 mark. \n\"I think all South Australians were really touched by what had happened and people just wanted to help,\" he said. \n\"And as a Government we looked around and there were a few things that we had in the cupboard that we thought we could auction off to go to the fundraiser. \n\"It's going to a great cause, Sam Willoughby, a terrific South Australian, obviously a great athlete ... but all-round nice guy as well.\" \nBids have opened at $500 with the online auction set to close Tuesday afternoon before the hot lap takes place on Friday afternoon.
