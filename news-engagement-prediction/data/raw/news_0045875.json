Javeria the hero as Pakistan tame Ireland \nEarlier in the day, India asked Pakistan to bat first — a decision that proved correct as Pakistan could muster only 67 runs in 43.4 overs. \nIndia’s Ekta Bisht proved too hot to handle for her Pakistani counterparts as she claimed five scalps for just eight runs. \nOnly Ayesha Zafar (19 runs off 33 balls) and Bismah Maroof (13 off 35 balls) showed some sort of resistance against the ruthless Indian bowling attack. Sana Mir becomes first Pakistani woman to reach 100 ODI wickets \nIn reply, India reached the target in only 22.3 overs for the loss of three wickets as Deepti scored an unbeaten 29 runs off 73 balls, while Harmanpreet chipped in with 24 off 35 balls. \n“We had a really horrible start to the match. Ayesha looked good but no other players were able to support her on the crease,” Sana told The Express Tribune . “It was a really bad day for us as only two players were able to score in double figures.” \nThe target was always going to be too small to defend but an early wicket did set the cat among the pigeons. “We had a chance when we got their first wicket early but then their other opener Deepti took over and remained in the middle till the end. It was their day and they did better than us and won,” Sana added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T18:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T13:46:51.994+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
