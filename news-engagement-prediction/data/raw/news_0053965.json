Manchester United's Henrikh Mkhitaryan was forced off after scoring against St Etienne. Source: AP \n“I don’t say that (that they will definitely miss out on the final), I just say what I feel. It’s three days (before the final), a hamstring and a calf. Even if it’s a minor injury I think three days is no time.” \nTo make matters worse for United, Mourinho has blown up at his side’s upcoming schedule as their FA Cup game with Chelsea was announced before the Europa League draw. \n“Of course and I feel really surprised that the decision is made before our draw in Europe,” Mourinho said after the game, when asked about the timing of the FA Cup game. \n“Because in this moment nobody knows where we play, nobody knows where the first and second matches are. \n“Imagine we play Chelsea on Monday and then we have to go to the second match in Europe in Russia, Turkey or Greece. \n“I think once more the interests, they go in front of the clubs and English football’s interests, and nobody cares about it. But this is what I have.” Manchester United's coach Jose Mourinho. Source: AFP \nBut all this begs the question – why did Mourinho choose to field so many key players in a relatively unimportant match, knowing what is to come (even if he didn’t know the exact date of the FA Cup tie or the opponents in Europe)? \nNow, he has publically tied his own hands, ruling out playing a second string side in the FA Cup to help strengthen their chances of succeeding in the Europa League – which acts as a route back into the Champions League should they lift the trophy. \n“I cannot play against Chelsea with the second team,” Mourinho said, using it as an opportunity to have a dig at United’s biggest rival, but also putting on the record the fact some players will have to risk fatigue-related injuries to compete on all fronts. \n“I cannot play against Chelsea with the under-21s like Manchester City did last year. I cannot do that – we are Manchester United. I don’t do that as Manchester United manager. I don’t do that to the FA Cup because the FA Cup is not guilty of these decisions.” \nMourinho added: “I cannot go there with U-21s. Probably they would deserve it, but I don’t do that, so what is going to happen is an accumulation of matches. \n“People playing a lot of matches, I have to make some rotation but some of the boys will have to play in all these consecutive matches.” 'The record is really good' 0:35 \nMANCHESTER UNITED’S FIXTURE CONGESTION \n— 27 February: United v Southampton (League Cup final) \n— 4 March: United v Bournemouth (EPL) \n— 10 March: Europa League Round of 16 1st leg \n— 14 March: Chelsea v United (FA Cup quarter-final) \n— 17 March: Europa League Round of 16 2nd leg \nPremier League games against Manchester City and Southampton have had to be rescheduled due to League and FA Cup commitments View All Comments  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T09:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:33:50.933+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
