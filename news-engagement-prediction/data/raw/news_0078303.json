I did not come to England before because it was not the moment. \n“I came when I thought it was the moment and the moment was there.” Rooney's full-kit celebration 0:55 \nEFL Cup: Despite not having played a minute of the EFL Cup final victory over Southampton, Manchester United's Wayne Rooney donned the full kit and captain's armband to lift the trophy.

I had my mind somewhere else. Before, everything was coming on top of the table, then Jose called. \n“I have a special relationship with him. When he called it was basically, ‘tell me what number I should wear’. \n“My mind was not here. Then my kids started to bump my head and Jose called, then I am here.” 'We got our trophy back!' 0:34 \nFootball: Scenes from the Manchester United dressing rooms after their EFL Cup victory over Southampton.

I feel fresh. I feel good. I feel like an animal. I feel like a lion. I feel in good shape. I train hard.” Ibrahimovic was equally bullish when asked if the only way was down if he left United, one of world football’s most well-known teams. \n“For me, or the club?,” he replied. “I will stop on top. I will not play one game by being Ibrahimovic and for what I did before. If I don’t perform, if I don’t bring results, I will not play. \n“I will play as long as I can bring results.” \nMeanwhile Ibrahimovic’s agent, Mino Raiola, offered few clues to his client’s future in an interview with Talksport radio on Monday. \n“I never speak about contract details with the press -- I think that’s something between the player, the club and myself,” he said.

I don’t disclude anything. Anything can happen and we will see what happens. \n“We’re now concentrated on the next cup. This was a very important cup and very emotional for him, for me and for Mourinho too.” Raiola said he’d never any doubts about Ibrahimovic’s ability to adjust to the Premier League. \n“Knowing how he is and what kind of person and man he is on and off the field, he can do it anywhere,” he said. “He’s the only player in the world who can be successful on Mars or the moon.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T12:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T08:21:26.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
