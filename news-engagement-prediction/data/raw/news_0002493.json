Diplomats from the embassy of the People's Republic of China were forced to travel to the Maoist-infested area since Wang's plight has garnered extensive attention on social networking sites in China, especially on Sina Wiebo where it's trending with #ChineseVeteranInIndia with more than 2.93 million views so far. Many visitors have accused India of violating 'Geneva Convention', while Indian authorities claim that he was not given a prisoner-of-war (POW) status. Wang met officials at the Chinese embassy in New Delhi on November 19, 2016 and requested them to arrange his visit to China at the earliest. He was accompanied by his son Vishnu, who is spearheading a legal battle to help Wang visit China. \"We are now hopeful that father would be able to visit China. Embassy officials had sent several communications to the Indian government for clearing documents, but they have not received any reply on the matter,\" Vishnu told TOI. They also went to meet external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj , unaware of the fact that she was undergoing treatment at AIIMS in Delhi for a kidney failure. Wang Chi was captured by the Indian Army on January 3, 1963 after he walked into Indian territory. He was a mechanical survey engineer. After being shifted from one jail to the other for eight years, Wang finally settled in a remote village in Balaghat district with an Indian name Raj Bahadur Wang. People here call him 'Cheeni Seth'. Some 54 years ago, comrades in People's Liberation Army knew him as Div Shu Nag Jung. And not far from his tin-roof home lives Wang Chi, another former Chinese soldier, who has taken on the name Raj Bahadur Wang. Captured in the edgy aftermath of the 1962 war, they were shuttled from Assam to Uttar Pradesh to Rajasthan, Punjab and Delhi before being dumped in anonymity in this tribal village. Div Shu Nag and Wang Chi are still under surveillance. Coincidentally, just a half-hour drive away from Maharashtra's Gondia, where a full-blown Maoist insurgency is on. The Chinese duo have married local tribal girls and even have grandchildren. But Wang Chi's desire to see his homeland one last time is growing stronger as he enters his sunset years. Div Shu Nag, a PLA infantryman, was arrested from Ladakh and Wang Chi, a mechanical survey engineer in the PLA, was nabbed in Arunachal on January 3, 1963. Div Shu was armed with a machine gun and 100 bullets when he was arrested. Since the war was over, they were treated as spies and not accorded POW status. \"I realised I had walked into Indian territory only after I was arrested. I was roaming around freely as the war was over. They blindfolded me and took me to Delhi. I was treated as a spy. I spent more than eight years in jails and was interrogated on espionage charges before being shifted to Balaghat,\" said Wang Chi. \"I maintained that I was not a spy, that it was an inadvertent trespass...\" It took 25 years for him to send a letter to his family in China. \"I have met former PM Rajiv Gandhi and deputy PM Lal Krishna Advani, too. I continued correspondence with them till Beijing accepted me as a Chinese national and began diplomatic lobbying for my return,\" he said. By then, the Chinese government had declared him dead. \"After getting my first letter, my mother and brother replied that now they would sleep in peace after 24 years of frantic search. Unfortunately, my mother passed away without seeing me,\" said Wang, tears welling up in his eyes. He says he wants to visit China just once, after which he will settle down in Balaghat \"forever\". In the 1980s, he had moved a PIL in high court seeking a visa. His lawyer gave up, after failing to get a reply from the home ministry despite several notices. On October 9, Wang Chi again wrote to the Chinese embassy asking about his visa. Div Shu Nag, meanwhile, is trying to get Indian citizenship. He married a local tribal and has five children, one of whom died. \"I faced more torture from a local policeman than the Indian Army. They took away all that I earned,\" he said, adding that he was implicated on charges of bootlegging for refusing to pay 'hafta' to a local cop. After toiling for over 50 years, Wang got a Chinese passport in 2013 with the help of the embassy. But there was another problem. \"The Chinese government says it won't allow me to return to India. How can I leave my wife, children and grandchildren behind,\" he asks. His elder son died a few years ago. Younger son, Vishnu, is spearheading a legal battle to help Wang visit China. \"Everyone out there is waiting for me. Imagine how happy my father would be,\" says Vishnu. Cheeni Seth, however, does not want to return to China. \"I don't have anyone out there. I'd be grateful if the Indian government supports my family here. We are living the life of destitutes. The state government now wants to take away the house we have been living in for 50 years. Please help me. I was not a spy, just a soldier,\" he says.
