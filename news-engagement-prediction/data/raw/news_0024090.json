Protection orders \nThe NHS figures analysed were between April 2015 and March 2016. They show a patient was assessed on average every 61 minutes. Among those who attended, a case of FGM is newly recorded every 92 minutes on average. \nThis means a woman or girl has their case recorded by the NHS for the first time, although in many cases they will have been cut some years before but it has not come to the attention of doctors sooner, the charity said. \nAvon and Somerset Police has led use of FGM protection orders (FGMPO) nationally. The orders were brought in to protect potential victims. \nIt has applied for 10 FGMPOs since July 2015, when legislation was brought in. \nDet Ch Insp Leanne Pook said: \"Each application is carefully considered and brought only in cases where they are deemed to be at risk. Support families \n\"We have one active FGM investigation ongoing at the moment, but the majority of our work in this area focusses on safeguarding referrals. \n\"This means working in partnership with our colleagues in local authorities, health and education to share information and visit and support families with children deemed to be at risk of FGM.\" \nThe figures come as the world marks the international day of zero tolerance to FGM - a UN-sponsored event to raise awareness of the issue. \nIt has been illegal to carry out FGM in the UK since 1985, but there has not been a single successful prosecution. This failure has been branded a \"national scandal\" by the Home Affairs Select Committee. \nSarah Champion, shadow secretary of state for women, said: \"Until we get a conviction I don't think the message is going to go out, loud and plain, that this is child abuse and is unacceptable.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T15:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T11:27:18.365+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
