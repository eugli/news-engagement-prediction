The lead quickly slipped through Atlanta’s fingers, though, as New England erased the sizable deficit en route to a 34-28 overtime victory . \nFor Patriots fan Diane Vadala, the incredible comeback win did not come without consequence. After James White powered into the end zone for the game-winning score , Vadala “jumped for joy,” which resulted in her breaking her foot , as she told Fox25 News. \n“I continued to jump on one foot, yelling, ‘I broke my toe!’” she said in a message to FOX25. “Turned out to be my top foot bone, not toe.” \nVadala wasn’t the only fan to suffer an injury as a result of the Super Bowl LI chaos. After Atlanta was defeated in gut-wrenching fashion, a Falcons fan’s frustrations led to a broken a leg. \n— SMASH Global (@Smash_Global) February 6, 2017 \nTalk about adding insult to injury.
