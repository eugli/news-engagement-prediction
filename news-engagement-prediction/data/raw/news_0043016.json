Critics fear new rates could lead to 'ghost towns'. Credit: PA \nMr Coupe said that investment could be slashed and high streets deserted if Theresa May decides to reevaluate business rates \nHe said: \"As it stands, we could see high streets face serious challenges and ultimately more closures. It could impact investment in places that most need it, in areas of the country where there is already a marginal call on investment. \n\"Our challenge to the Government is for a fundamental reform of business rates, because we believe it is an archaic and outdated system. More than that, we'd like the Government to look at business taxation in general.\" \nHis comments come after business groups, including the British Retail Consortium and the CBI, signed a letter on Friday urging the government to abandon business rates reforms. \nA Government spokesman said: \"Nearly three quarters of businesses will see a fall, or no change, in their business rates as a result of the revaluation. \n\"Our business tax system is currently ranked as one of the most effective in the world.\" Last updated Sun 19 Feb 2017 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T16:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T11:19:00.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
