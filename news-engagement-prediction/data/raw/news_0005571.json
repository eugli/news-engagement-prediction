Article continues below \nThe Jackal said: \"Me and Leo have now had 24 rounds with each other and they've all been pretty competitive rounds. \n\"It's one-all now so if I'm going to look at any sort of positive it's that we have to make it a trilogy. I want to fight Leo again. Straight away. Article continues below Kevin Nolan signs himself for Notts County \n\"I want to fight in Belfast next, that's what I want to do. \n\"I feel like I've came to the States twice now and Leo has said he would do it in Belfast the third time. \n\"I hope he's a man of his word.\" \nWell, Santa Cruz says he is just that and originally made it clear that to have a real legacy as a champion, he needs to take on all types of challenges. \n“I’m a man of my word and a true champion will go anywhere,” Santa Cruz said. “I know the crowd will be all for him and it’s going to be really hard. I’m willing to go over there. A true champion goes anywhere. If they want to make a trilogy, I’m up for it. But there are many options out there, too.” \nHowever, according to BBC Sport, Santa Cruz has also stated that the decision may not ultimately be in his hands, casting some doubt on an immediate rematch. \n\"If it was up to me, I will go and fight him [in Belfast] but it's not just up to me,\" said the 28-year-old Mexican. \nWould you like to see the pair square up again?
