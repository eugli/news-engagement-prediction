Il a tout mon appui\n— @DenisCoderre Parti Québécois Leader Jean-François Lisée said the government should oversee the situation, rather than have one police chief call another to request an investigation. \nTables turned on veteran cops  In this case, Jimmy Cacchione and Giovanni Di Feo were police officers for decades, often working undercover while targeting Hells Angels and the Mafia.\nThe officers told TVA that in 2012, they launched their own investigation about possible corruption within the force, looking at officers possibly receiving money from the Mafia.\nBy 2013, they had prepared a letter to send to the public security and the media outlining what they had learned.\nMayor Denis Coderre said he's 'troubled' by the revelations and praised Pichet's quick response. (Radio-Canada)\nThey were called in to police headquarters and expected they would be given a chance to explain.  \nInstead, they were suspended and told they themselves were being investigated. \nCacchione and Di Feo were never charged, and disciplinary complaints against them were dropped as part of a confidential agreement with the force that included their agreement to resign in 2014.\n\"We're two whistleblowers who tried to inform high-ranking officers about longstanding corruption within the force,\" Cacchione told TVA.\n\"It's unacceptable to qualify us as bad guys after all our service.\"\nOfficers allege errors, fabrications Cacchione and Di Feo said once they saw copies of the allegations by internal affairs, they found several errors.\nFor example, Di Feo said one internal affairs report said he was the godfather to the son of Luigi Coretti, a businessman accused of fraud.\nDi Feo pointed out that Coretti has no children. He told TVA it was just one of many errors made by internal affairs investigators.\nCacchione said: \"We have the fabrication of allegations. Once they've fabricated the allegations, they launch investigations with the goal of muzzling people who have things to say.\"\nA third officer, Roger Larriviere, told TVA a similar story. He said he was targeted by internal affairs after raising his concerns about problems within the force to then Chief Marc Parent in 2014.\nThe lonely politician defending Montreal's police chief", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:42:38.838+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
