Chris Harrowell \nHillpark Bakery's Anne and Tongmin Li won prizes including a trophy and certificate for having the country’s best hot cross buns. They’re pictured with Baking Industry Association of NZ president Kevin Gilbert. \nMore than 30 Kiwi bakeries took part in the contest which is run by the Baking Industry Association of NZ and judged by a panel of experts. \nAs the winner, Li's bakery receives a trophy, pallet of Farmers Mill flour, display certificate, 1000 award stickers for his products and a $1000 advertising package. \nAssociation president Kevin Gilbert presented the prizes to Li and his wife Anne on February 15. Chris Harrowell \nHillpark Bakery owner Tongmin Li has been recognised as the maker of New Zealand's best hot cross buns. \nLi, who came to New Zealand from China in 1999, has owned the bakery in Grande Vue Rd for about 13 years. \nHe finished second in the competition in 2007 so is pleased to have finally won gold. \n\"We've been waiting for 10 years,\" Li says. \n\"It's too long to go from second to first. \n\"Everyone wants to win and make the perfect hot cross bun. \n\"The competition is very tough. It's hard work.\" \nLi says he goes through a process of experimentation to make his hot cross buns as tasty as possible and he reads recipe and cooking books to get ideas. \nThe main ingredients he uses are flour, water, butter, egg, cinnamon, mixed spice, sugar and salt. \n\"We always try to make them with more flavour but not very strong. \n\"They smell nice but when you eat one it stays in your throat. \n\"I change it every year. We try new things. \n\"My wife is the first judge. If she doesn't pass them they cannot go [into the competition].\" \nGilbert says the gap between first and second place in this year's contest was \"really close\". \nEntries were judged in categories including technical ability, presentation, innovation and placement of the cross on top of the bun, he says. \n\"The judges felt his [Li's] buns were quite reminiscent of childhood. \n\"Hot cross buns are a comfort food. \n\"Others made innovations, which is good, but the judges felt his took a more traditional approach and brought back childhood memories.\" \nSecond place went to Hastings City New World and third place to U-Bake in Timaru. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T10:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T10:36:08.778+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
