These features are signs of ancient construction. \n\"As we were stripping the topsoil to view more of these pits and postholes, we saw this glint of gold beneath the topsoil,\" Toolis told Live Science. \nArchaeologists cut a 80 kilogrammes chunk of earth from the ground that encased the artifacts inside. This block was taken to the lab for a small-scale excavation that took a week, Toolis said. \nInside the block was a bronze spearhead, decorated with gold. The spearhead had been bundled with a bronze sword with a lead-and-tin pommel, a bronze scabbard (a sheath for a sword) mount and a chape, the metal fitting at the end of a scabbard. The bundle also included a bronze pin. \nThe new discovery is rarer because it contains not just metalworks, but organic materials, he said. \nThere are remnants of fur-bearing skin around the spearhead and microscopic fragments of textiles around the bronze pin, he said. \nThere are also pieces of the sword's wooden scabbard preserved in the bundle. All of these organic artifacts can be radiocarbon dated to pinpoint their age, Toolis said. \n(With PTI inputs) First Published: Thursday, February 23, 2017 - 20:43 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T07:28:28.910+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
