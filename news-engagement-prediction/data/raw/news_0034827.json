Needless to say, it's a somewhat strained conversation at times. \nIndeed, Wendig makes a point of demonstrating the pressure points in the two's relationship that would, eventually, take them to where they were in The Force Awakens : Leia's dedication to what she sees as her duty, and Han's conviction that there's a better life elsewhere, freed of that same duty and able to travel through space in search of adventure… or, at least, profit. Reading the scene knowing how things turn out makes for an especially bittersweet experience. \n(Not least of all because the two jokingly refer to their future son as both a \"little bandit\" and a \"little angel,\" illustrating the dichotomy that would eventually lead to Han's death.) \nStar Wars: Aftermath — Empire's End is the third and final installment of Wendig's Aftermath trilogy, which charts the immediate aftermath of the events of 1983's Return of the Jedi and sets up the relationships and status quo of The Force Awakens . The novel, published by Del Rey, will be released Feb. 21.
