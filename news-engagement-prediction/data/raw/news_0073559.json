The venue was not confirmed in the tweeted announcements from both boxers. But April 23 is a Sunday, which reinforces Pacquiao's previous declaration that his next fight will happen in the United Arab Emirates. Manny Pacquiao won a unanimous decision against Jessie Vargas in Las Vegas last November and will now take on Amir Khan on April 23 Amir Khan has not fought since he was knocked out by Canelo Alvarez last May My team an I have agreed terms with Manny Pacquiao and his team for a super fight #pacquiaokhan #April23rd — Amir Khan (@amirkingkhan) February 26, 2017 Negotiations between team Pacquiao and team Khan have come to terms for the April 23 bout as this is what the fans wanted. #PacquiaoKhan — Manny Pacquiao (@mannypacquiao) February 26, 2017 Pacquiao, 38, tweeted: 'Negotiations between team Pacquiao and team Khan have come to terms for the April 23 bout as this is what the fans wanted.' And Khan posted: 'My team an I have agreed terms with Manny Pacquiao and his team for a super fight #pacquiaokhan #April23rd.' It also follows reports that a £32million offer from that Gulf state has trumped promoter Bob Arum's plans for Pacquiao to defend his world welterweight title against Australian Jeff Horn in Brisbane. Pacquiao with his welterweight title belt after defeating Vargas in Las Vegas last November Khan and Pacquiao pictured together back in January 2015 - they will now meet in the ring There were early suggestions of Khan bringing Pacquiao to his home-town Bolton football stadium or Manchester Arena. But that is improbable on a Sunday. The Pacman claims to be responding to his twitter poll asking fans to nominate his next opponent, which Khan topped by a wide margin. Pacquiao polled his Twitter followers to find his next opponent, with Khan coming out on top But he also revealed that the desert Sheiks were keen for him to select Khan who, as a Muslim, would be a major attraction in the UAE. Khan was the clear winner, with 48% of the 45,000 votes polled, ahead of Kell Brook, Terence Crawford, and Jeff Horn. The bout will be Pac-man's 68th fight, of which he has lost six and drawn two. Khan will enter his 35th bout at the age of 30, eight years junior to his opponent.
