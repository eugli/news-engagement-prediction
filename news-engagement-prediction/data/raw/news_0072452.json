Pre-trial motions are expected to be filed by March 20, according to Judge Mario Mattie. \nIn court Wednesday, Mattie asked Abad's lawyer Mario Gallucci if there had been any agreement to resolve the case. \n\"There is not, judge,\" Gallucci said. \"I believe we are going to end up going to trial.\" \nAbad stood without saying a word after Gallucci informed the judge of his decision to go to trial. \nAfter the hearing, Gallucci said the plea offer from the Assistant District Attorney Mark Palladino was for up to 21 years in prison and that if Abad goes to trial and is convicted he could get a maximum of 25 years. \n\"After carefully considering all the evidence and discussing the case with expert witnesses and with witnesses at Curve's strip club, Mr. Abad has decided to enforce his right to go to trial,\" Gallucci said. \nAbad's decision comes nearly two years after the March 20, 2015 crash when, according to police, he drove the wrong-way on the West Shore Expressway shortly before 5 a.m. and collided head-on with a tractor-trailer. \nFellow Linden police Officer Frank Viggiano and fellow Linden resident J oseph Rodriguez , both 28, were killed in the crash, and a third Linden officer, Patrick Kudlac, 25, was critically injured. Kudlac was later forced to resigned from the police force, as a result of his injuries. \nAbad was also critically injured and was later fired from the police force because he was unable to return to duty. \nDiscussions of a plea deal began earlier this year , with Abad's attorney, Mario Gallucci, requesting a prison sentence of five to 15 years and Assistant District Attorney Mark Palladino pushing for a higher sentence of 7 to 21 years. \nAbad and others had been drinking at Curves strip club. Prior to driving to Staten Island that evening, Abad had been at a popular bar in Roselle, Central Park. Abad had posted a photo of their drinks on social media. \nThe crash stunned the Linden Police Department and people across Linden. \nKudlac and relatives of Rodriguez have filed lawsuits against the strip club and another against Central Park. \nAuthorities say Abad had a blood-alcohol level of .24, three times the legal limit at the time of the crash. \nIn September 2015, the District Attorney's Office in Staten Island announced that Abad faced a 27-count indictment , including multiple charges of aggravated vehicular homicide and manslaughter. \nAt his first few court hearings, Abad was in a wheelchair. As he recovered from his injuries, Abad was able to walk on crutches, then with a cane, and a few months later he entered the courthouse without a cane. \nThe case dragged on, in part, because of a dispute over tests on a sample of the former officer's blood. Gallucci, had argued that dancers at the strip club might have drugged Abad with GHB - the so-called date rape drug - in an attempt to make him spend more money. \nAfter months of delays, the blood was finally tested and showed no traces of GHB. \nGallucci also tried to get evidence of his blood-alcohol excluded from the trial, claiming the first officer at the scene of the crash reported that he did not smell any alcohol on the former officer. \nA judge rejected that argument. \nTom Haydon   him on Twitter @Tom_HaydonSL .
