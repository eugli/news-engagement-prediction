Photo: Mark Zammit Cordina \nHe said such an extreme action sent a clear message to all government critics in a bid to scare them. \nHe said if the Prime Minister truly believed in free speech, he would give his blessing to the Opposition bill. \nDr Busuttil also spoke on the Panama Papers scandal saying the two people closest to the Prime Minister were clients of a criminal organisation. \nReferring to the news that Mossack Fonseca’s owners were charged with running what prosecutors dubbed a criminal organisation, Dr Busuttil said that Konrad Mizzi and Keith Schembri were clients of that very firm. \nThe two men used Mossack Fonseca to set up secret companies in Panama. \nDr Busuttil said the owner of a third Panama company was still unknown. \nThe Opposition leader said Prime Minister Joseph Muscat reacted angrily when asked who owned this third company in Parliament this week. \n“The Prime Minister was angered by this question. He personally insulted me when the microphones were off. All I did was ask who owns the third company. Why does he get so angry? I think I know why, I think we will all get to know why eventually,” Dr Busuttil said. \nDr Busuttil warned that it was a clear threat to democracy when those at the very top turned a blind eye on corruption. \nThe Opposition leader also announced that the PN would be organising a national demonstration for liberty and democracy next Sunday. \n« Tritons start journey to Florence for restoration Advert <a href='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/ck.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=31770245637&n=45064309' target='_blank'> <img src='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/avw.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=31770245637&n=45064309' border='0' alt=''/> </a> \nSee our Comments Policy Comments are submitted under the express understanding and condition that the editor may, and is authorised to, disclose any/all of the above personal information to any person or entity requesting the information for the purposes of legal action on grounds that such person or entity is aggrieved by any comment so submitted.
