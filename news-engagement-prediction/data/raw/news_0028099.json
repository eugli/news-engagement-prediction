Davina McCall, Richard Ayoade, Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders have all been named as potential hosts, while chefs ranging from Delia Smith to Michel Roux Jr have been tipped as replacement judges. \nLeith has worked with Channel 4 as a judge on competitive cooking show My Kitchen Rules UK, which aired late last year. She was also a judge for 11 years on the BBC’s Great British Menu, on which Berry appeared as a guest. She stood down in October , weeks after being made chancellor of Queen Margaret University in Edinburgh . \nLeith, born in South Africa, opened her Michelin-starred restaurant, called Leith’s, in 1969 before going on to found cookery school Leiths School of Food and Wine in 1975. She later sold the business, retaining only the restaurant. She has written12 cookery books, six novels and a memoir, Relish. \nThe Sun’s source said: “In cookery circles, she’s practically royalty.” \nBake Off is expected to return to TV screens this year after the BBC said it would not exercise a “hold-back” clause stopping Channel 4 from airing its version of the show until 2018.
