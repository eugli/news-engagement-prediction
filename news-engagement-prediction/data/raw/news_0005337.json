You might want to see if you can complete the basic fitness test matched to your age. Working with Tim Wright, the creator of Beyond Movement, Virgin Active has devised a checklist of simple exercises you should be able to complete to ensure you are as fit and as mobile as you could be for your age. Whether you’re 22, 32 or 72 – the below movements have been designed as fitness barometer for those looking to maintain good health - and they might not be as easy to complete as you think. Virgin Active has devised a checklist of simple exercises you should be able to complete to ensure you are as fit and as mobile as you could be for your age, so can you complete it? IN YOUR 20s YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO... Run 5K in thirty minutes Perform 20 burpees in a row Hold a full plank for one minute each side Tim says: 'Regular exercise, reducing chronic stress, quality sleep and a balanced diet can have enormous health benefits both in your twenties and in the future. 'Whilst late nights are tempting in your twenties, try to aim for on average seven hours of good quality sleep per night.' IN YOUR 30s YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO Run a mile in less than 9 minutes Hold a plank for 45 seconds Deadlift more than 50 per cent of your bodyweight Tim says: 'In your thirties, try to be active and break up your day so you’re not sitting for extended periods – this helps offset the effects of ageing. 'Examples could be walking in your lunchbreak or investing in a standing desk.' IN YOUR 40s YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO Sprint for 60 seconds without stopping 10x press ups without stopping Touch your toes comfortably whilst keeping your legs straight Tim says: 'In your 40s, it’s important not to be too reliant on public transport or your car. Over 10,000 steps count as a very active movement day – which is great for the musculoskeletal system (your joints, muscles and bones).' Tim, who created Beyond Movement, a new physiotherapy, sports massage and Reformer Pilates service from Virgin Active, says: 'Regular exercise, reducing chronic stress, quality sleep and a balanced diet can have enormous health benefits both in your twenties and in the future' IN YOUR 50s YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO Run at a moderate pace for 60 seconds without stopping 5x burpees without stopping Lower yourself into a cross-legged sitting position on the floor (without using your hands) and then return to standing Tim says: 'Between the ages of 50 and 70 we lose about 30 per cent of our muscle strengths so it’s important to maintain a fitness regime. 'However, as well as looking after your physical performance, make sure to give yourself headspace each day, building in at least five minutes of relaxation.' IN YOUR 60s YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO Regularly take more than 10,000 steps in a day Perform 12 bodyweight squats without stopping Touch your fingertips with one hand over your shoulder and the other behind your back Tim says: 'According to the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP), those over the age of 65 have a 1 in 3 chance of sustaining a fall, even if they are in good health. 'Ageing impairs balance, muscles and joints and is made worse with long periods of sitting down so try to incorporate regular exercise throughout the week in your sixties.' IN YOUR 70s YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO Walk a mile in less than 16 minutes Climb a flight of stairs with 10 steps in under 30 seconds comfortably Rise to stand from a chair without using hands or arms and repeat 12+ times in 30 seconds Tim says: 'The likelihood of sustaining a fall increasing in your 70s, making it even more important to remain active. 'Never exercised before? Remember to start with small, achievable and personal goals such as taking up swimming a couple of times a week or walking the dog daily.'", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T23:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T19:01:10.288+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
