It's just too bad she couldn't save herself; but I'd say it's nothing short of a miracle the way it ended up.\" \nMiracle is the right word for it. Rescuers found the child in her seat atop a pile of rubble outside the fire (below): \nKeana was taken to the hospital, suffering only a minor burn. \nSadly, Carter never made it out of the house; an autopsy revealed she died almost immediately from smoke inhalation. \nNo cause has been found for the fire, though investigators say they don't suspect foul play. \nShelby's mother, Kathy Hardy , has taken her \"Beautiful Miracle\" home.
