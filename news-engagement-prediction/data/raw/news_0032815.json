Source: News Corp Australia \nUnfortunately for the Tigers, Idris’ return wasn’t enough as Jason Taylor’s men suffered a 20-10 trial loss to St George Illawarra. \nThe Tigers looked competitive without stars James Tedesco, Luke Brooks, Mitch Moses and skipper Aaron Woods, but they were ultimately outclassed by the Dragons. \nMATTHEW JOHNS: ‘Andrew’s a pain in the arse’ \nYoung five-eighth Jack Littlejohn impressed in his limited chances, laying on a perfectly-timed kick in the first half for fullback David Nofoaluma to score. \nVeteran prop Tim Grant stood out up front, while hooker Matt McIIwrick looked dangerous around the ruck and will provide the Tigers with invaluable depth this season. \nIn the end, though, it was St George Illawarra who recorded a hard fought victory. \nThe Dragons may have won, but the race to replace injured halfback Drew Hutchinson remains unclear. \nEmerging half Jai Field followed up his eye-catching performance at the Auckland Nines with a mixed display in his maiden taste of 13-aside football.

One-on-one with Jamal Idris 4:41 \nThe Dragons trailed 10-0 at quarter-time, before surging back into the contest to score four unanswered tries. \nLock Jack de Belin was sinned binned for striking Tigers forward Elijah Taylor two minutes into the second quarter. \nThe Tigers will look to respond when they take on North Queensland at Campbelltown Stadium on Friday night.
