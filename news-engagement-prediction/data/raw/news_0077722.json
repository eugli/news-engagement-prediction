Night Shyamalan 's successful Split , which has globally earned more than $220 million since its release about five weeks ago. \nAnd for Get Out — which opened in 2,781 theaters this weekend and cost only $5 million to make — a 100% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes has really helped things out, as has its A- CinemaScore , which is somewhat unusual for a film in the horror genre. \nWait… a well-produced, well-directed horror film that has some artistic sensibility in addition to being scary?? \nLove it!!!! \nRelated: Game Of Thrones ' Neil Fingleton Dead At Just 36 Years Old \nUniversal's domestic distribution President Nick Carpou summed things up nicely about Peele, and the movie, in this quote : \n\"We already knew how talented Jordan Peele is. Now, we're witnessing a new chapter in his creativity. This movie speaks to a lot of truths. It isn't really a horror film, it is very subversive and deals with issues of the day that are both frightening and funny.\" \nWell said!! \nCongrats to Peele on a GREAT opening weekend. The movie industry isn't hurting right now, that's for sure!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T04:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:09:02.234+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
