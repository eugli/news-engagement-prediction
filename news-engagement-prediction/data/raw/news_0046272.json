Article continues below \nAnd there was one Sutton player who seemed to relish the opportunity to show what he can do, and acted as Sutton's biggest threat throughout the night. \nRoarie Deacon was once on the books at Arsenal, coming through the youth ranks before moving to Sunderland and eventually making his way down the divisions. Article continues below Sutton's manager reveals the 'amazing gesture' Arsenal made after their game \nAt 25 there is still a hope that he could have a career as a professional yet, but he obviously wanted to prove to Arsene Wenger that he still had something to offer. \nArsenal used the game as a chance to bed in a few youngsters, with highly-rated defender Rob Holding being one of them. \nBut unfortunately for Holding, he was nothing but a victim for a moment of magic from Deacon, who slipped the ball cheekily through his legs during the early stages of the game. \nDeacon later would rattle the crossbar with a stinging effort, which was unlucky not to find its way past David Ospina. \nHe even managed to pick up the BBC's Man of the Match award for his troubles, capping off what will surely be a memorable night for him. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
