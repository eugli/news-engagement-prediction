M. Night Shyamalan had the best response to THAT mix-up at the Oscars \nGet your minds out of the gutter straight away. First off, (unfortunately) Jamie is married to Amelia Warner and the couple have two daughters together. Secondly, Fifty Shades isn’t real. Sorry to crush all your dreams. \nBut Dakota did open up about her relationship with her co-star Jamie, saying he made her feel comfortable in some of those saucy sex scenes. The pair get a bit saucy in the Fifty Shades series (Picture: Universal Pictures) \nShe told OK! Magazine: ‘It’s genuinely one of the fastest, closest friendships I’ve ever made in my life, just based on the amount of time we’ve actually known each other. \n‘I love Jamie, I trust him and I really couldn’t tell you if I could have done this without him.’ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:52:44.338+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
