India moved up only one rank on the World Bank’s ease of doing business ranking last year, a disappointing result for the Narendra Modi government that made several initiatives and has set itself a target to break into the top 50. \n\nIndia is ranked 130 out of 190 countries in World Bank Group’s annual report ‘Doing Business 2017: Equal Opportunity for All’. \n\nBelow are the seven steps that the Budget 2017 proposes to make doing business in India easier. \n\n1. Scope of domestic transfer pricing restricted to only if one of the entities involved in related party transaction enjoys specified profit-linked \ndeduction. \n\n2. Threshold limit for audit of business entities who opt for presumptive income scheme increased from Rs. 1 crore to Rs. 2 crore. Similarly, the \nthreshold for maintenance of books for individuals and HUF increased from turnover of Rs. 10 lakhs to Rs. 25 lakhs or income from Rs. 1.2 lakh to Rs. 2.5 lakh. \n\n3. Foreign Portfolio Investor (FPI) Category I & II exempted from indirect transfer provision. Indirect transfer provision will not apply in case of redemption of shares or interests outside India as a result of or arising out of redemption or sale of investment in India which is chargeable to tax in India. \n\n4. Commission payable to individual insurance agents exempt from the requirement of TDS subject to their filing a self-declaration that their income is below taxable limit. \n\n5. Under scheme for presumptive taxation for professionals with receipt upto Rs. 50 lakhs p.a. advance tax can be paid in one instalment instead of four. \n\n6. Time period for revising a tax return is being reduced to 12 months from completion of financial year, at par with the time period for filing of return. \n\n7. The time for completion of scrutiny assessments is being compressed further from 21 months to 18 months for Assessment Year 2018-19 and further to 12 months for Assessment Year 2019-20 and thereafter.
