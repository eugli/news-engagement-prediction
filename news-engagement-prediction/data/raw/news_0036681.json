(Photo: Provided by WildStyle DaProducer.) 147 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nBattle rapping is known as a competitive aspect of hip-hop, thanks to Eminem’s 2002 film “8 Mile.” \nBut rappers don’t participate in less-familiar “beat battles,” which instead showcase producers and their instrumental tracks. \nProducers who bring creativity and technical prowess to beat-making can claim bragging rights and cash at these contests. Without words in the mix, attentive audience members listen to music that ebbs, flows, agitates and soothes. \nIn Indianapolis, the undisputed trailblazer for beat battles is J. Brookinz. He organized annual beat battles from 2009 to 2014, and he launched the J. Brookinz Battle League in 2015. \nThe second half of the league’s second season launches tonight at Fountain Square’s Hi-Fi nightclub. \nYou won't hear complicated rhymes and withering insults that define battle rapping. But here are four ways the J. Brookinz Battle League resembles big-league sports: \n1. A draft. Similar to an NFL owner, Brookinz selects the players in his league. Thirty producers applied for the second season, Brookinz said. With help from WildStyle DaProducer and Bringing Down the Band blogger Sean Stuart, Brookinz selected 16 competitors who made the cut. Whether a producer specializes in mainstream hip-hop, underground sounds or even EDM, all styles are battle ready, Brookinz said. “If the music is hype and the people are into it, it’s a good battle,\" he said. \"I’ve had good battles between people who were very similar in styles and good battles between people who were completely different in styles.” \n2. Scoring. Similar to NASCAR, the J. Brookinz Battle League is made up of a series of events featuring all competitors. If a producer loses in the first round of one event, it's possible to come back and take top honors at the next event. Eight events make up a battle league season, and first season overall winner Dylan Prevails leads the pack through four events this season. Points accumulated through seven events will determine the eight competitors eligible for the season's final battle — a format not unlike NASCAR's \"Chase for the Cup.\" In terms of prize money, battle winners collect $200 at events two through seven. The King of Beats crowned at the season finale gets $500 and a trophy. Opening night, which coincides with the Fountain Square hip-hop festival known as Chreece, also boasts a $500 prize for the winner. \n3. Strategy. Similar to the NBA Slam Dunk contest, a beat battle calls for excellence in multiple stages. A basketball star who saves his best dunk for the final round may not make it there if he falls flat in the preliminaries. In the J. Brookinz Battle League, competitors bring at least eight original beats (no longer than 90 seconds each) with hopes of presenting two each in the opening round, quarterfinals, semifinals and finals. \"You don’t want to play your best first,\" Brookinz said, \"but you kind of do want to play your best first so you can advance.\" Regardless of the round, Brookinz said it's important to be quick with a positive impression: “I always tell (producers), ‘If you’re not getting their attention in the first 15 seconds, you’ve already lost them.' \" \n4. Intangibles. Similar to Olympic figure skating, style points count in beat battles. Competitors are judged on creativity, sound quality and \"nod factor,\" or the ability to make heads nods throughout a crowd. And producers are becoming more demonstrative onstage when their tracks are played. It's common for beat makers to stand passively, but some, including league competitor Joey French, make dramatic arm gestures to accompany his work. \"It’s almost like he’s up there translating his music to the crowd,\" Brookinz said. \"In the grand scheme of things, most producers are introverts. But they’re starting to get out there more with their personality. That’s your brand.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T01:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T03:05:02.223+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
