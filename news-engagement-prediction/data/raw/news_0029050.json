That was shortly after 9/11,\" she said. \"So we've been in this circumstance before.\" \nShe said the board is trying to prevent that from happening again. \nHowitt said the cancellations are just an \"interim\" measure, and the board will re-evaluate going forward. She didn't say when that would be. Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T09:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T04:40:26.483+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
