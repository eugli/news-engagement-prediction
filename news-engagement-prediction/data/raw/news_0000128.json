Loosely based on the Aurora massacre that happened during a Cineplex screening of The Dark Knight Rises , Tim Sutton's powerful comment on gun culture follows six strangers who all meet the same fate: a truly dark night. \nIn select theaters February 3 2 Of 19 'Growing Up Smith' \nGrowing up is hard to do. Even more so when you're coming of age in a foreign country. Meet Smith Bhatnagar, an Indian oddball who meets his two greatest loves–at age 10. Gather the fam for this likeable fish-out-of-water immigrant tale with a good showing from Jason Lee and an even better big-screen debut from Ron Akurati. \nIn theaters February 3 3 Of 19 'I am Not Your Negro' \nNominated for an Oscar for Best Documentary Feature this year, Raoul Peck's cinematic conversation about race and hatred in America is a continuation of a book author James Baldwin couldn't finish before his death in 1987. It unfolds through the assassinations and ideas of three very important black men: Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X and Medgar Evers. Its message cuts just as deep today as it did all those years ago. \nIn theaters February 3 4 Of 19 'Rings' \nRebooting a franchise is difficult. Bringing a techno-horror hit from the '90s into the modern day? Even more difficult. But we're rooting for director F. Javier Gutierrez—say so long to the ancient VCR and hello to evil email attachments, as Samara has now gone viral. No screen is safe. \nIn theaters February 3 5 Of 19 'War on Everyone' \nIf you aren't a fan of John Michael McDonagh's films yet, his latest, a buddy cop dark comedy, might just do you in. With Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Pena leading the charge, McDonagh's third feature looks to be his most commercially friendly yet. Just watch this trailer , then tell us you don't want to see this movie. \nIn select theaters and On Demand February 3 6 Of 19 'Fifty Shades Darker' \nChristian, Ana and Ana's inner sex goddess are all back for more pain, ecstasy and painful ecstasy. House of Cards 's James Foley directs, and as its title suggests, the saga takes a dark turn: Christian confronts inner demons and Ana deals with Christian's sour exes. Hey, we're not looking for Oscar fodder here, just a guilty pleasure that'll satisfy a Valentine's Day craving. \nIn theaters February 10 7 Of 19 'A United Kingdom' \nDavid Oyelowo and Rosamund Pike star in Belle director Amma Asante's true-life drama about the interracial marriage—between a future Botswana king and his white British bride—that sparked an international furor in the 1940s. As pertinent as it is crowd-pleasing, it's one you should take Kleenex to. \nIn theaters February 10 8 Of 19 'Kedi' \nAnimal lovers would be remiss to not seek out Kedi , a magical documentary from Ceyda Torun that gives cinematic street cred to the four-legged variety. In Istanbul, where the many roaming city cats aren't strays but rather citizens and symbols of a higher power, Torun lowers his camera to their POV and lets the story unfurl. \nIn theaters February 10 9 Of 19 'A Cure for Wellness' \nIt's been 15 years since Gore Verbinski launched the J-horror craze stateside with The Ring . After a Caribbean vacay (he directed all three Pirates of the Caribbean films) with a stopover at animation station ( Rango ), the visionary director has returned to the genre, and needless to say, we are so excited. A Cure for Wellness , about a guy who uncovers some strange business at a seemingly idyllic spa in the Swiss Alps, promises to be the cure for what ails an often-underwhelming genre. \nIn theaters February 17 10 Of 19 'American Fable' \nOne glance at the poster for Anne Hamilton's arthouse fairytale and two words spring to mind: Pan's Labyrinth . A bit of an homage to Guillermo del Toro's Oscar gem, Hamilton's 80s-set thriller also unfolds through the eyes of a pint-size protagonist. Her name is Gitty, and she's an 11-year-old farm girl who just wants a scary story with a happy ending. You'll just have to go see it to find out if she gets what she wants. \nIn select theaters and On Demand February 17 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T10:18:01.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
