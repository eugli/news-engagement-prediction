They are also working with Interpol in the investigation,\" he said. The media here had quoted Indonesian authorities as saying that they be allowed to meet Siti Aisyah. - Bernama ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T18:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T13:25:36.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
