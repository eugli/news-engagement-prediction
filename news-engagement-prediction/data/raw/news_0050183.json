Find the credit and both songs below. \nAs previously reported , FUTURE also includes the song “High Demand,” in which Future raps, “We do a whole lotta numbers, yeah/Grab on that pussy like Donald, yeah.” The lyric is in reference to lewd comments Donald Trump made about women, captured in a 2005 recording that was released in the lead-up to the election. \nFuture – “Might as Well” \nWritten by Nayvadius Wilburn, Chance “Tarentino” Youngblood, Win Butler, William Butler, Regine Chassagne, Jeremy Gara, Tim Kingsbury, Richard Parry and Owen Pallett. \nPublished by Nayvadius Maximus Music/Irving Music (BMI) / Tarentino Publishing (BMI) / EMI April Music Inc.
