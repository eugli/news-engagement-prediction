Google and Dutch scientists teamed up \nUnknown to many was that Google had approached two of the researchers involved in The SHAppening and offered their help in continuing their work. \nWith Google's immense computing power at their disposal, and with the help of five of Google's top cryptographers, this seven-man team published today new research detailing a full SHA1 collision attack. \nAs proof of their work, they also released two different PDF files that feature the same SHA1 hash, which stands to serve as evidence for the first ever successful SHA1 collision. \nTo better understand their announcement and the consequences of an SHA1 collision attack in the real world, imagine you signed a contract, stored it online as a PDF, and used its SHA1 hash to authenticate that nobody tampered with the file. \nKnowing now that SHA1 hashes could be faked, how would you tell if someone hasn't replaced the original PDF contract with another one that has the same SHA1 hash, but completely different clauses? Proof-of-concept code to be released in 90 days \nThe only good news out of today's announcement is that Google engineers described the SHA1 collision attack as \"one of the largest computations ever completed,\" meaning it won't be financially possible to execute such attacks anytime soon. \nNevertheless, Google plans to release the proof-of-concept code that they used for the collision attack in 90 days, meaning companies that still rely on SHA1 have three months to replace it with something else. \nWith computing power becoming cheaper each month, and with PoC code publicly available, generating custom SHA1 hashes on a daily basis is just months/years away. \nGoogle has released the two PDF files with the same SHA1 hash here and here , and the following infographic with more information on the attack.
