On her Instagram account (“Third Wheel Extravaganza“) , she wrote, “Ah, love. It makes the world go round. Unless you’re me. Then you just lurk in the background of cute couples.” \nI know that this is one of those things that girls would eat up, the only thing that would make it go even more viral is if she were lovingly posing with pizza or a bottle of wine so girls could be like “LOL I TOO LOVE THOSE THINGS MORE THAN MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIPS” and laugh until they cry into their withering ovaries. But overall it’s the kind of thing I try to advocate against to callers on Swipe Drunk Love and in general: Don’t sabotage yourself. Dating’s 90% about confidence and you can shoot yourself in the foot by bathing in your loneliness or awkwardness or whatever a little too much. Chicks gobble up this kind of thing though and like to act like they’re so undateable or so broken or whatever and it’s like…pussy still works right? You’re probably good then. I bet this chick’s photos have a Reddit thread somewhere of dudes who would send Bitcoins and tip their fedoras at her all day in an effort to win her heart and she’s just here pulling some “woe is me” social media attention whoring and acting like a victim instead. Get out there, get that dick, make the car whole. Or try to get popular enough on Instagram to make a book for lonely girls with their pints of ice cream to chuckle at, to each their own. \nAlso in fairness a guy did a series of Third Wheel photos too and obviously the headlines were just as positive and “you go girl!” as this chick’s is…right?
