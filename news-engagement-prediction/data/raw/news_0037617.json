Attacks on press by @realDonaldTrump more treacherous than Nixon's. \n— Carl Bernstein (@carlbernstein) February 18, 2017 Real news (not fake) is that @realDonaldTrump trying to make conduct of press the issue instead of egregious (and unhinged)conduct of POTUS. \n— Carl Bernstein (@carlbernstein) February 18, 2017 When focus of press was on Hillary's server–by same 'fake news' orgs/'enemies of the people' cited by @realDonaldTrump –he saw patriots. \n— Carl Bernstein (@carlbernstein) February 18, 2017 \n[Image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T10:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T06:12:17.637+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
