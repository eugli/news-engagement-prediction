The wind was picking up as players left the field, allowing general manager John Mozeliak the perfect backdrop for a question he might otherwise have answered less directly. \n“I’m usually more cautious, but let’s throw caution to the wind,” he said, figuratively tossing something into the gust. “When you think about where Rosey was or Carlos Martinez was in their careers, I think Sandy is paralleling them. \n\"What could this year look like for him? It wouldn’t shock me if he pitched in the big leagues.” \nA storm is gathering. \nEntering spring training there was talk within the organization about Sandy Alcantara, the 21-year-old power arm that could capture the imagination of the major-league coaching staff and, like others before him, use spring as a launch pad. Trevor Rosenthal did it. Carlos Martinez did it. And the organization is going to position Alcantara to do it this year. \n“And then you would say to me what role would that be?” Mozeliak continued as we walked back toward the main building. “And I would say to you I don’t know. I think he’s capable of doing just about anything in the game. But when you look at how he could have an impact on the major-league club – would it be out of the bullpen or as a starter? At this point in his career he’s very much like what you saw out of Carlos and Trevor.” \nAlcantara, signed as a teen in the Dominican Republic, spent this past season at the Cardinals’ Class A affiliates. In 23 starts he had a 3.96 ERA with 153 strikeouts in 122 2/3 innings. (He walked 59.) The K-rate and other indicators were similar to Cardinals’ prospects who have hinted at a leap with their Class A numbers. Carlos Martinez – 6-5, 3.93 ERA, 84 2/3 IP, 98 Ks at Class A. Trevor Rosenthal – 7-7, 4.11 ERA, 120 1/3 IP, 133 Ks at Class A. Alex Reyes – 7-7, 3.63 ERA, 109 IP, 137 Ks at Class A. \nReyes, rated as one of the best power prospects in the game coming into this season, returned to a Class A level after the above success. He would finish with 233 strikeouts in 172 2/3 innings at Class A. He dominated all levels on his way to the majors. Alcantara and others merely overpowered opponents. Rosenthal pitched in Class A in 2011 and reached the majors straight from Class AA in 2012. Martinez pitched in Class in 2012 and debuted in the majors, fresh from Class AA, in 2013. Reyes pitched in Class in 2015 and, yep, reached the majors midway through 2016. Recognize a trend? \nMozeliak was present at the game last year when Alcantara touched 102 mph with his fastball. The righthander routinely reaches 100 mph, and like Reyes he has been able to sustain the velocity late into games. What set Alcantara apart from his peers in the Low-A Peoria rotation last year was not just the torpedo fastball. He developed a curveball that he could use, not just show, and there is a growing feel for his changeup. \nAlcantara used to flip curves, spin them. Now he drives them, creating more of a power breaking ball. It was how he grew on the mound last season that started the murmurs that he could be the next flamethrower to speed to the majors. \nIt was also how, well, he just grew. \nAlcantara was a lithe beanpole type righthander – all levers and legs at 6-foot-4 and 170 pounds – when he made some appearances before the Cardinals’ brass last spring training. This spring he’s more power forward. He’s added at least 20 pounds since the above weight. His muscles have caught up to his frame. His grip strength rated as one of the highest of any pitchers – if not the highest. Manager Mike Matheny has often remarked how Alcantara just cuts the figure of power. He’ll get his first chance to see how that look appears on the mound against an opponent as soon as Sunday, and certainly by Monday. \n( Read more about Alcantara’s back story here, from columnist Jesus Ortiz .) \nHis future, long term, is as a starter. His presence, however, this coming month in major-league camp gives him a chance to show how he’d look later this year in the bullpen. The Cardinals are eyeing him for a spot in the Class AA Springfield rotation, and as it was with Rosenthal and Martinez, the leap to Class AA puts him one small step away from the majors. \n“I remember seeing him last August and you could see the evolution starting to happen and the development happening,” Mozeliak said. “Dynamic fastball. Has to improve the secondary stuff, understand his secondary pitches, and understand how to pitch. From a pure talent standpoint he’s real exciting. You always hate judging a book by its cover, but you look at him now and he looks the part.” \n-30-", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:12:01.452+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
