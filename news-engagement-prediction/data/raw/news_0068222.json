On his stark, shell-shocked 2016 EP It Kindly Stopped For Me , he grappled with the recent deaths of several friends That grieving process continues on his band’s upcoming You're Not As As You Think , which confronts Boucher with a new challenge: How does he balance the emo group’s snarky past with such maturing and gravec interests?“A Better Sun” solves this by satirizing the ways that even grief can become routine. Boucher sleepwalks through his life, checking off boxes. “This is the part where I am proper/This is the part where I’m just another face,” he sings flatly over a grungy dirge reminiscent of Meat Puppets . Even in his bereaved trance, though, glimmers of his old humor shine through. He mischievously one-ups his peer Julien Baker by rewriting the closing lines from her track “ Sprained Ankle ”: “This is the part where I’m a marathon runner and both my ankles are sprained.” Deflated opening chords eventually give way to a blistering guitar solo, and a slow fizzle brings “A Better Sun” to a cathartic close. “This is the part where I am empty,” Boucher sings. “This is the part where it ends.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T22:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T02:22:44.764+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
