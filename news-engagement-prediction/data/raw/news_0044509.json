The All-Star honor was just the latest example of the Celtics’ return to prominence. And if Stevens (along with guard Isaiah Thomas) was able to do some recruiting and leave a good impression over the weekend, that’s just gravy. \nThumbnail photo via Russ Isabella-USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T23:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:41:23.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
