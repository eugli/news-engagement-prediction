But if some reports are to be believed, his team's grasp of tech leaves much to be desired. \nFor example: Recent reports allege the Trump team leans on an encrypted messaging service called Confide . The problem, according to security experts : It's not clear whether Confide is actually encrypted at all.

The next morning, Spicer tweeted a very similar string of letters and numbers , prompting a fresh round of ridicule from the Twitterverse. \nAs for what exactly the letters and numbers were, we'll never know: Spicer never commented.

Watchdogs found that the official presidential Twitter account had been registered to an insecure, cloud-based Gmail address . \nLess than three hours after the story of this potential security threat broke on Twitter , the POTUS account was linked to an official White House email address.
