Iran was one of the seven countries affected by the measure, which has since been blocked from being carried out by a federal court ruling. \nThe Salesman about a couple performing Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman and their attempts to find peace and justice after the wife is attacked at their Tehran apartment had become a rallying cry for immigrant rights after the travel ban. \nThe six nominated directors in the foreign language category had put out a joint statement ahead of the award decrying what they called the climate of “fanaticism” in the U.S. The award was the second Oscar for Mr. Farhadi, after his film A Separation won in the same category for 2012. \nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said he saw the prize as taking a stance against Mr. Trump’s executive order. \n“Proud of Cast and Crew of The Salesman for Oscar and stance against #MuslimBan. Iranians have represented culture and civilization for millennia,” he tweeted in English. Vice President Ishaq Jahangiri praised Mr. Farhadi both for the award and for boycotting the ceremony, calling it a “priceless action.” \nState radio and television briefly reported on Mr. Farhadi’s Oscar, while Tehran film daily Banifilm ran an op-ed saying Mr. Trump had “probably never imagined what contribution the travel ban would have for Farhadi’s film.” The trade paper said the executive order had likely propelled “The Salesman” to victory.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:20:51.216+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
