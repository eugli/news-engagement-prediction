Source: Tweet \nAfter failed stints at Manchester United and Chelsea, Falcao has rediscovered his goalscoring form this season. \nThe Colombia international has scored 22 goals in all competitions and shapes as being a major threat to Manchester City in the first leg of the UEFA Champions League last-16 tie between the clubs on Wednesday. \nJardim is thrilled with how Falcao has returned to form, saying Monaco's hard work had paid off. \n\"I knew Falcao before he came to England because he was playing in Porto, in Portugal,\" he told a news conference. Guardiola wary of Falcao threat to Manchester City Pep Guardiola believes Monaco's free-flowing attacking style is the key ingredient in Radamel Falcao's late career resurgence ahead of his Manchester City side tackling the Ligue 1 leaders in the Champions League. \n\"He's still a great striker, a great goalscorer. It's easy to work with him. \n\"This year we paid attention to the specific work because the last two years he did not play much. But now, he is in good shape. \n\"We are happy with him. He is an important player for the club and also for the team.\" \nFalcao scored just five Premier League goals in total while on loan at United and Chelsea, but has four in his past four games ahead of Monaco's trip to the Etihad Stadium. \nMonaco are top of the Ligue 1 table, three points ahead of Paris Saint-Germain, having scored 76 league goals in 26 games - the most goals of any club in Europe's top five leagues.
