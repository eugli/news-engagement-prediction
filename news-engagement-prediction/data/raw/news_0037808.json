While Trump has vowed to crack down on immigration laws, he’s offered few specifics on how he would handle the DREAMers.\nDuring the campaign, Trump said he would revoke DACA, but he has since muddled his position on the issue. His comments Thursday are the latest sign that Trump may ultimately take less hard-line immigration stances than he offered during the Republican primaries.\nThe question of whether he revokes the program and how he handles those given amnesty under it has been described by those on both sides of the issue as one of the crucial early tests of his presidency.\nBut Trump seemed to have no clear answer, telling reporters repeatedly that it was a “difficult thing.” “You have these incredible kids… mostly,” he said, though he added that some were “gang members and drug dealers,” which made the situation more difficult.\nIt was unclear if the president was referring to a DACA recipient who was arrested by immigration agents in Washington state last week. Agents say Daniel Ramirez Medina, 23, is an admitted gang member and eligible for deportation, though his lawyers have denied it, pointing to the fact that he has no criminal record.\nTrump gave no indication when he would make a decision about DACA, telling reporters only that he would “show great heart.”\nRead more from Yahoo News:\nTrump slams ‘un-American’ leaks: ‘Just like Russia’ Jerusalem or Tel Aviv?
