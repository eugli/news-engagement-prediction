LGBTI groups condemn homophobic comments at far-right Q Society meeting Read more \nBernardi said on Sunday after reading accounts of the interventions at the Sydney event, he spoke to the function organisers to make it clear he thought the remarks were “totally inappropriate.” \nThe Q Society is a rightwing advocacy group that describes itself as a not-for-profit civil rights organisation with the goal of informing Australians about Islam. The events last week were part of the group’s “Halal Choices” campaign. \nDuring the Sydney event, Cameron said, among other things, that the Liberal party was “basically a gay club” – adding: “I don’t mind that they are gay, I just wish, like Hadrian, they would build a wall.” \nAccording to reports of the event, Pickering said not all Muslims were bad because some “do chuck pillow-biters off buildings.” \n“Let’s be honest, I can’t stand Muslims,” Pickering was quoted as saying. “If they are in the same street as me, I start shaking.” \nBernardi distanced himself from the remarks during an interview on Sky News on Sunday, describing the behaviour as “an own goal from some of [the Q Society’s] supporters.” \n“I said it was totally inappropriate,” Bernardi said on Sunday. \nHe said the anti-halal certification campaigners at the Q Society were already “marginalised, and I think unfairly”, and they didn’t need more obstacles put in their path through ill-disciplined or inappropriate outbursts. \nHe said Pickering’s intervention was indefensible because what’s going on in some corners of the world is “no joking matter.” \nBernardi said he spoke to Ross Cameron in order to understand the context of his intervention “and he explained the historical nature of his comments, but in reading them, I don’t think there’s anything funny about them.” \n“They did some damage.” \nBernardi said he remained a strong supporter of free speech, and would call out examples of “bad speech.” \nHe said free speech advocates invested their confidence in people to do the right thing. “When bad speech comes forward, it’s up to good people to drive that out and denounce bad speech and bad ideas.” \nOn Sunday, appearing on Sky News, Cameron said he had apologised for his intervention, and he acknowledged he’d “contributed to a loss of narrative” at the Q Society event. \nBernardi’s public interventions on same sex issues have also landed him in hot water over the years. \nHe was labelled a homophobe by the opposition leader Bill Shorten last year after he led the charge by conservative MPs opposed to the safe schools program, an anti-bullying initiative established by the then Labor government and launched by the Coalition in 2014. \nHe said the program was linked to gender-fluid advocacy for children. \nIn 2012, Bernardi lost a front bench position in the Abbott government because of remarks he made about legalising same sex marriage, characterising marriage equality as the thin edge of the wedge. \n“The next step, quite frankly, is having three people or four people that love each other being able to enter into a permanent union endorsed by society – or any other type of relationship,” Bernardi said during parliamentary debate in 2012. \n“There are even some creepy people out there... [who] say it is OK to have consensual sexual relations between humans and animals.” \nBernardi has consistently denied he holds homophobic views and responded to Shorten’s intervention by dismissing it as name-calling . “It was Bill Shorten’s Latham handshake moment – unhinged and character illuminating.” Topics ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T07:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T02:51:32.253+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
