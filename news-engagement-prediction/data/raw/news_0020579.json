They're offerings are so on point, I actually was taken aback that they'd need to add anything else to their collection. But after laying my eyes on the new Sigma Beauty 3DHD Blender, I got the picture. I shouldn't be super-duper surprised that when Sigma Beauty launched their first blender sponge, the results would be major. What makes the Sigma Beauty 3DHD Blender different from the hundreds of other makeup sponges out on the market is the unique shape. The adorable little sponge contains three purposeful sides. There are two flat sides to make contouring, baking and highlighting even and precise. There's also a round side like the OG BeautyBlender , which is ideal for blending and pressing makeup into furrows and divots. And last but not least, the new sponge has a pointed edge to help target any imperfections in hard to reach areas. See: Streaky foundation around your nose creases or a speck of errant highlighter around your eyes. The sponge—which comes in the signature Sigma beauty colors of hot pink and black—was inspired by the Sigma collection of 3DHD brushes. Those brushes are also designed with the unique contours of your face in mind. Rather than just offering a traditional fluffy pouf of a Kabuki brush, the 3DHD version is angled to an almost pointy tip, which dusts powder on every nook and cranny on your face.
