Now parts of the Golden State are suffering from the opposite problem: too much water. \nExtreme flooding this weekend washed away chunks of highway, derailed trains and inundated homes in Northern California. At Lake Oroville, a major man-made reservoir, water began flowing over a never-before-used emergency spillway at the Oroville Dam. \nThe 770-foot-tall dam — the tallest in the country — lies about 150 miles northeast of San Francisco. Opened in 1968, the colossal infrastructure supplies water for farms in the Central Valley and homes and buildings in Southern California.

That's when water began pouring over the emergency outlet for the first time in the reservoir's nearly 50-year history. \nWater had already started flowing through the dam's heavily damaged main spillway. Heavy rains late last week caused the concrete structure to unexpectedly cave in, leaving a 30-foot-deep hole that continues to grow. \n\"This is mother nature kind of kicking us a few times here,\" Bill Croyle, the California Department of Water Resources' acting director, told reporters Saturday. \nThe water level in Lake Oroville began falling by Sunday afternoon, but state officials said water could still keep washing over both spillways into Monday. \nThe deluge threatens to knock down trees and send debris cascading into the already-swollen Feather and Sacramento Rivers and into the San Francisco Bay. Peak flows over. Outflows above inflows at #OrovilleDam . Reservoir #water level to slowly fall, for now. Breather until next storm. #cawx pic.twitter.com/1eWHbGFg19 A video posted by Zeb pawledge (@zebs_pics) on Feb 11, 2017 at 5:26pm PST \nDespite the onslaught, the Oroville Dam is sound and doesn't pose an imminent threat to the public, authorities said. \nIn the unlikely event that it did fail, communities from Sacramento to San Francisco would face cataclysmic flooding. Devastating drought to relentless rains \nThe torrential rainfall in California so far this year is a swift about-face for the Golden State, which is still suffering from its worst drought on record. \nIn 2014 and 2015 alone, the state economy lost billions of dollars as crops withered and farm jobs vanished, researchers from the University of California, Davis, found. \nResidents and businesses across the state were forced to sharply reduce their water usage as reservoirs turned into sunbaked patches of mud. \nImage: U.S. Drought monitor \nYet now, parts of Northern California are in the midst of their wettest winters in at least two decades. \nA barrage of atmospheric \"rivers\" in recent weeks has continued to dump rain and snow across the region, helping to end the drought in northern areas. \nSan Francisco, for instance, has received at least 21.86 inches of rain since Oct. 1, or 146 percent of its average for the season, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported . \nSouthern California, however, is still a few more storms short of ending its drought. \nAdditional reporting by Associated Press.
