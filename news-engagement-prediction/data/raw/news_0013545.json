After being asked how he felt about it, Tyson made the dining table laugh when he said: 'It shows I'm not full of s**t.' So close! The pair scored an impressive 102 points out of 110 points for their instant restaurant, beating Tim (L) and Kyle (R) who made the record on Monday's show Success: Amy added to camera: 'To make MKR history and pip Tim and Kyle off the post is phenomenal, we definitely have a target on our back now' Amy added to camera: 'To make MKR history and pip Tim and Kyle off the post is phenomenal, we definitely have a target on our back now.' The duo - who are dubbed the show's 'serious siblings' - cooked up a rather interesting array of dishes. They served an entree of lamb brains with cauliflower puree, sriracha aioli and pickles, and a main of pork jowl with eggplant puree, pumpkin puree, pommes frites and apple cider sauce. For dessert, they impressed with a chocolate raspberry discovery. Not for the faint hearted! The duo - who are dubbed the show's 'serious siblings' - cooked up a rather interesting array of dishes (seen are the lamb brains) Unusual: They served an entree of lamb brains with cauliflower puree, sriracha aioli and pickles Tasty: A main of pork jowl with eggplant puree, pumpkin puree, pommes frites and apple cider sauce was served Tyson added about their victory: 'We knew we could cook but to get that kind of score is unbelievable.' The pair beat Tim and Kyle's record of 100 points. They scored full marks and ten out of ten for each dish from judge Pete Evans, which Pete said was the first time he ever scored three tens on My Kitchen Rules. He said he 'couldn't fault' the dessert and loved the main, saying: 'The amount of flavour in that dish was just sensational.' Manu Feildel scored the pair ten for the entree, nine for the main and a ten for dessert, saying the dessert was full of 'texture.' Delicious: For dessert, they impressed with a chocolate raspberry discovery He's a fan! They scored full marks and ten out of ten for each dish from judge Pete Evans (R, seen with Manu) Manu also praised their brave choice of cooking brains for entree, saying they clearly understand the technicality of food as they cooked it so well. They also scored 43 out of 50 from their competitors. While cooking, the contestants at the dining table said how much they were hoping to see 'angry man' Tyson crack. He came close, saying while cooking the main how stressed he was when he burned the pork and had oil hit him and yelled. Well it is a competition! While cooking, the contestants at the dining table said how much they were hoping to see 'angry man' Tyson crack They also wanted to live up to their expectations and deliver 'above average' food, after claiming throughout the series that their competitor's dishes were either 'average' or 'below average'. Amy said before the cook: 'I'm hoping we can meet or exceed people's expectations...prove that we're not all talk,' she said. Tyson and Amy's instant restaurant was the last of the first round, with Bek and Ash being on the chopping block and facing elimination off the show. However, the long-awaited elimination twist was revealed at the end of the show. Elimination twist! Bek and Ash (seen), who are at the bottom of the leader board on 26 points, will battle David and Betty for a place in the competition Rather than the lowest scoring team going home, the two lowest scoring teams will go head-to-head in a cook-off. It means Bek and Ash, who are at the bottom of the leader board on 26 points, will battle David and Betty for a place in the competition. 'There's no way we're going home...we're hustlers,' David said to camera. Bek was more relaxed about her approach to the cook-off. 'Sudden death isn't a great word, it's scary, but it's another chance and I'm going to take another chance right now.' It's on!
