Share via Twitter Disney Sure, Beauty and the Beast itself is set in more of a desolate, trudge-through-a-snowstorm-to-save-your-imprisoned-father kind of climate, but any true fan's love for the Disney fairy tale knows no meteorological bounds. And now, Hot Topic has our (sunscreen-protected) backs, releasing two Beauty and the Beast â€“themed bathing suits that'll help you bring your love for this tale as old as time out into the light. Swimwear is the latest trend in a host of Beauty and the Beast products released in advance of Disney's live-action adaptation of the classic. Both Hot Topic suits are bikinis styled in a retro fashion. One takes its cues from Belle's ballroom gown, the most iconic yellow dress in cinematic history. It has a halter top with a blooming yellow rose at the center, while the bottoms are bustled to give the suit that heavily layered period look without the involvement of a rib-pinching corset . Hot Topic The second piece takes inspiration from the storybook opening of the animated movie. Its design mirrors the beautiful, multicolored stained glass used in the story's setup. Like the Belle-inspired suit, it has a halter top and high-waisted bottom. Hot Topic The tops and bottoms are sold separately for both pieces, with each costing $20 to $30. And if the Beauty and the Beast bathing suits leave you nostalgic for more Disney beachwear, Hot Topic has a whole collection of swimsuits inspired by Disney princesses. Follow the site down the rabbit hole, and you'll find aquatic looks styled after Alice in Wonderland , Snow White , and, of course, The Little Mermaid .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:51:02.090+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
