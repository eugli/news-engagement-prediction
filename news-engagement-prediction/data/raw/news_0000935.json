The secret society has been blamed for a range of events by crazed conspiracy theorists. Some theorists have linked the organisation with the Battle of Waterloo; the French Revolution; the assassination of Presidents Lincoln and Kennedy. Others believe that the Illuminati control Hollywood and have a membership which includes senior political leaders. These include Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga, Theresa May and Angela Merkel, according to conspiracy theorists.
