Covenant a 'win win' for farming, biodiversity \nThe NCT's chief executive officer Gary Wells said the covenants had to work with farmers. \n\"We're not looking to lock up land, it's very much about finding a happy medium where it works for both biodiversity and the farming operation and in fact bringing cattle in here under an appropriate regime actually looks after the biodiversity here rather than being detrimental to it, so it's actually a win-win for the farming and the biodiversity,\" Mr Wells said. \nMs Cannon believed export markets would pay a premium for her produce based on the farm's environmental credentials. \n\"We produce grass fed only beef which has quite stringent accreditation so we put the steers in this country quite a lot so it's actually a symbiotic relationship between the cattle and this country,\" she said. \n\"We've also put that Nature Conservation Trust label on our wool saying that from time to time the sheep that produce the wool that we sell graze in this covenant country managed by the Nature Conservation Trust and that's certainly provided quite a high level of interest from wool buyers particularly in Europe but also the Chinese buyers,\" Ms Cannon said.

(ABC News: Sean Murphy ) \n\"It's all about brand reputation so we want to be at the high end, I think that's the only place to be.\" \nThe Woomargama covenant is a boonto science according to Charles Sturt University professor of ecology, David Watson. \n\"It's one of the most pristine, best managed grassy woodlands in southern Australia,\" Professor Watson said. \n\"It's boxgumgrassy woodlands, it's a desperately rare kind of habitat and these bits left are precious because they're not in national parks, national parks are in country that was left uncleared that nobody wanted but this place has been so well managed for so long we're all now benefitting from it.\" \nHe said the economic benefits of conservation estates were now being quantified: such as the impact of more bird life on insect populations or how more tree cover could protect livestock from extreme weather. \n\"There's insectivorous birds there that eat grasshoppers out in the field, well can you measure that, can you tell me how much more grass I'm getting, how much more meat I can produce and we're doing that now,\" he said. \n\"If you're talking about far less winds, lower wind shear, so on a cold night you're losing fewer lambs, fewer blowflies, more insectivorous birds, more diverse pastures, deeper rooted perennial grasses in your pastures, that just comes right back to your pocket every time.\" \nThe NCT has about 50,000 hectares of high value conservation land protected on private property in New South Wales. \nUnder new land management laws passed last November the NSW Government is replacing the trust with a new legal entity called the Biodiversity Conservation Trust. \nIt will manage the NCT estate and will have $240 million to spend on new conservation agreements over the next five years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T14:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T09:22:34.756+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
