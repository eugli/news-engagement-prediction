Some say they spent nearly a year undergoing treatment while believing they had the mind-robbing illness.\nThe former patients and their families say the diagnoses left them devastated. One patient killed himself. Other patients say they thought about taking their own lives before the center in Toledo shut down last year.\nRecords show clinic director Sherry-Ann Jenkins didn't have a license to practice medicine. Her attorney declined to comment on the case, which has not yet resulted in criminal charges.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T09:06:51.863+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
