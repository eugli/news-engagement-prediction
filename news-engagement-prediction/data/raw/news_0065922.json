ADVERTISEMENT \nIntroducing the new handle on her current Instagram account, Watson said: “I hope you enjoy seeing what goes on behind the scenes. It takes a village!” \nOn Tuesday, the account had just three posts, but had already amassed over 260,000 followers. The first photo posted showed the actress in a black-and-white Stella McCartney coat, with a caption referring to the brand as “the world’s first luxury brand that is committed to producing products that do not use leather, skins, feathers or fur.” \nShe teamed the piece with a jumper from sustainable label Filippa K and shoes from the vegan brand Good Guys Don’t Wear Leather. A post shared by The press Tour (@the_pres_tour) on Feb 19, 2017 at 11:12pm PST \nThe second look, a “Jacobian flower-embroidered duchesse satin bustier with an organic silk faille sash and organic wool trousers,” came courtesy of the new Oscar de la Renta co-creative directors Laura Kim and Fernando Garcia. \nThe third, from Louis Vuitton, shows the star wearing a navy and blue dress made from Newlife recycled polyester, created from used plastic bottles. \nThis is not Watson’s first attempt at steering the fashion conversation towards sustainable choices. In 2010, she collaborated with the fair trade fashion brand People Tree on several ethical clothing collections, also creating a sustainable capsule collection with Italian designer Alberta Ferretti one year later.
