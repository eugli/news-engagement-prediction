Armstrong, who contends that the USPS benefits outweighed the sponsorship costs, sought to have the case decided by summary judgment in April 2016.

Landis stands to gain up to 25 percent of whatever sum the government recovers. \nPaul Scott, an attorney for Landis, said by email, \"We look forward to the day soon when we can put this case before the jury at long last.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T08:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:41:09.334+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
