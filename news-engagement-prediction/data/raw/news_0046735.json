Determined to prevent this from happening, Trish, who is now a rich and powerful woman, sets out on a final quest with Jack Taggart Sr. and Jr. to end the Creeper’s reign of terror once and for all. The Creeper fights back in gory glory as its enemies grow closer than ever before to learning the secret of its dark origins.” The original ‘Jeepers Creepers’ appeared in 2001, marking the return of the creature feature.

But can ‘Jeepers Creepers 3’ bring the franchise back from the dead? It’s certainly a promising start to see fan favourite Gina Philips back for the third instalment… and by teaming her up with the Taggarts from ‘Jeepers Creepers 2’, it certainly taps into the best of both movies. But for now, we’ll have to wait and see. ‘Jeepers Creepers 3’ stars Gina Philips alongside Jonathan Breck as The Creeper. Victor Salva will direct the film based on his own script.
