(Photo: Raymond Carlin III, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nBaylor acknowledged it fired an assistant strength and conditioning coach Monday after he was arrested over the weekend for attempting to solicit a prostitute, according to the Waco Tribune . \nThe coach, Brandon Washington, came with first-year Baylor coach Matt Rhule from Temple University. He was charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a maximum six months in jail and $2,000 fine in Texas. He was arrested at a hotel as part of a prostitution sting. \nWashington was a former player at LSU on its 2003 national championship team and previously worked on the strength and conditioning staff at Alabama and Nicholls State. \nMORE BAYLOR: Matt Rhule addressed Baylor scandal 'head-on' with parents, recruits \nThough Washington only arrived at Baylor in December, the timing and optics are unfortunate for a school that is still enduring the fallout of a sexual assault scandal that cost former coach Art Briles, athletics director Ian McCaw and school president Kenneth Starr their jobs last year. \nWashington's employment was terminated immediately. Baylor said Washington passed a background check when he was hired. \nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL COACHING CAROUSEL Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
