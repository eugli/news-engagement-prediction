The Mounted Police Professional Association and Quebec Mounted Police Members' Association have made similar complaints.\nCUPE makes 1st move to unionize some members of RCMP ​Senators remove controversial bargaining limits in RCMP union bill Still no answers for Mounties on pay raise or unionization \"No group has been provided access to internal email or intranet. Members are prohibited from looking up any of the [associations'] websites on work computers. It's an undue hardship,\" said Brian Sauvé of the National Police Federation.\nWith officers spread out across Canada, sometimes in small rural and remote locations, Sauvé said electronic communication is the only sure bet for getting in touch and informing employees about their options, especially when the only computer or cellphone at their disposal is provided by the RCMP.\nSauvé added that many members of the RCMP don't participate in social media. \"Some, like air marshals or undercover officers, are compelled to protect their identity so they can effectively serve the public and safeguard their families.\"\nBulletin boards inside RCMP buildings are also off limits for union materials as are any kind of discussions while on-duty.\nReprimanded for disseminating information Cpl. Charles Mancer found that out the hard way. He has since filed his own complaint with the labour relations board.\nMancer is vice-president of the association hoping to represent Mounties in Quebec. Last May, while off-duty at RCMP headquarters in Montreal, Mancer said he and a colleague informed Mounties they had rented a space off-site where people could learn about their association and sign membership cards.\n\"The reason why we did that is because, clearly, we cannot use the communication system in the RCMP. That's a choice [the RCMP] made. Legally we are allowed on our own time to discuss anything about unions and that's why we informed members to come on their own time in a space outside the RCMP space to talk about it,\" Mancer told CBC News.\nYet at the end of November, Mancer — who is also a lawyer — received a formal written reprimand.\nMounties are accusing the RCMP and Treasury Board of unfair labour practices. (CBC)\n\"So this leaves a stain on my record and I have never had any discipline in the past. I have been 17 years in the RCMP and this is the first time,\" said Mancer.\nWith no ability to appeal discipline where no pay was deducted, Mancer complained to the labour relations board and is expecting a hearing next month.\nNo one from the RCMP responded to CBC's request for comment.\nCollective bargaining bill still in limbo However, in documents filed in response to Mancer's complaint, the RCMP through Treasury Board denies it has violated Mancer's rights or engaged in any unfair labour practices.\nIt asserted the rules are clear — no one can use any RCMP resources to support, promote or share information about forming an association. It also says Mancer should have explicitly asked for permission to participate in the Quebec association.\nMeanwhile, there is still no word on what the government will do with its bill to set the ground rules for RCMP unionization.\nThe Senate sent bill C-7 back to the House of Commons last June after making several major amendments, including removing a long list of contentious issues that had been excluded from collective bargaining.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T01:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T09:45:09.970+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
