There were only two blocked shots the entire time, including zero by the West. The West actually hasn’t blocked a single shot in three straight years . \nThis was unwatchable, and even more so when you could consider the potential for entertainment if the best players in the world would give even preseason-level effort for one-third of the game. \nMORE: Ranking every player int he 2017 NBA All-Star Game \nWhile it’s silly to get too deep into stats from an All-Star exhibition, there are a few here that tell a clear story. And it’s an unfortunate one. \nIt’s a story of defenders standing around without making even the slightest attempt to contest a shot or get in someone’s way. \nIt’s a story about players giving up on retaining a shred of resemblance to a real game of basketball, like it was not too long ago. \nIn the ‘90s, the average total score was exactly 250 points. There were 12 blocked shots per game and more than 53 free throws attempted on average. Those numbers reflect a fast-paced contest in which the players had fun while also attempting to impede each other’s progress at times. \nThat approach allowed for classic moments such as Shaq on David Robinson in 1996: Shaq posterizing David Robinson during the 1996 All-Star game! #Ballislife #HoopDiamonds https://t.co/Qus8pOjlHL \nAnd this Kobe-Jordan exchange in 1998: RT NBAAllStar: Kobe Bryant & Michael Jordan duel at the NBA All-Star Game in 1998! #ThankYouKobe https://t.co/btsJEYaGz8 #NBA — ACB Jornada Virtual (@ACBJV) April 13, 2016 \nThe next decade started off beautifully. Highlights from the 2000 All-Star Game remind us that a scoring play actually looks way more impressive when there’s a defender trying to stop it from happening — and blocks are cool too: BEST ALL STAR GAME EVER pic.twitter.com/Fy6PJvH2Gt — PEGEE (@VH1PNUT_) January 29, 2017 \nThe next year came arguably the greatest All-Star game ever played, during which saw Allen Iverson and Stephon Marbury lead the East back from a 21-point fourth-quarter deficit and outduel Kobe for a last-second win. \nWe are light-years removed from any fired-up reaction like the East has at the end of this clip, which is some compelling stuff: The 2001 #NBA All-Star Game was one of the best of all-time. The back-and-forth down the stretch was crazy. Miss this. pic.twitter.com/eKONnv3Z00 \nMORE: W e can partially blame LeBron for the NBA going soft \nThe next several years gave us a couple of competitive contestsm such as in 2006 and 2010 , but the quality of the game had been gradually declining. Then in 2014 it took a nosedive into embarrassment. \nFrom 2000 to 2013, the average game saw roughly 268 total points with a respectable 33 free throws and nine blocks. Over the past three years those numbers deteriorated to 336 points, 14 free throws and 1.3 blocks. Yes, four total blocked shots in three years. \nThe past three All-Star “Games,” with last season reaching an all-time low, became cringeworthy exhibitions that looked like rehearsed layup lines with a sign somewhere for “applause” that only the audience can see. \nYou might remember the 2014 game as the one where Kyrie Irving was ashamed to even hold up the MVP trophy while LeBron and Wade patronized him. \nMORE: How to ensure every NBA slam dunk contest is as good as 2016's \nThe MVP has pretty much become open to any player who’s willing to take the risk of looking like he cares, which makes it no surprise that a player who only knows one speed is the two-time reigning winner — Russell Westbrook. \nMaybe this current style is entertaining to a casual fan who watches a few basketball games a year, but those who legitimately appreciate NBA basketball deserve better (give Pau Gasol some love for that hustle, though). @nba 2015 NBA All-Star Game Best Plays https://t.co/q2V71lXcUW — YoutubeFanatics (@YoutubeLoves) January 11, 2017 \nYes, Pau, minimal effort like that is all we want. No one’s asking players to dive for loose balls or go after chase-down blocks to risk a Paul George-type injury. Just give us 75 percent effort and the product will be exponentially better. \nWe don’t need a cheap, two-hour dunk contest. There’s one the night before and the dunks are (usually) a lot better.
