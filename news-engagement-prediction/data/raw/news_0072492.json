Hezbollah propoganda unit photo of alleged IDF spy gear planted in Lebanon. (photo credit:ARAB MEDIA) \nHezbollah media reports on Wednesday claimed that the Israeli military had planted spy devices in southern Lebanon.The Lebanese Shi'ite terror group accused IDF soldiers of installing tracking devices, including cameras and solar-powered transmitters, and crossing the so-called Blue Line border demarcation with Israeli in the early hours of the day. \"The Israeli enemy penetrated through the technological barrier surrounding the village of Meiss Ej Jabal, in the Qurum a-Shiqui region near the Blue Line, and planted spy gear in the area,\" read a post on a Hezbollah-affiliated Twitter account. Hezbollah's propaganda unit has released photographs alleging to show the purported Israeli-planted instruments. The report surfaced shortly after Hezbollah denied Arabic media reports that Israeli jets overnight struck a weapons shipment en route to the terror group near the Syrian capital of Damascus.The alleged attack came after a week during which Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah made several aggressive statements against Israel in an appearance on Iranian television as well as in interviews with the Lebanese media.The terror organization's leader threatened to attack Israel in the near future, saying that \"Hezbollah will have no red lines in the next war with Israel,\" and also warned Israel from entering into a conflict with Hezbollah: \"Israel should think a million times before it goes to war with Lebanon.\"Last week, Lebanese President Michel Aoun defended the weapons which Hezbollah has, saying the arms of the terror group are an essential part in defending Lebanon against Israel.Hezbollah previously accused Israel in January of breaching the border demarcation to install espionage devices in Lebanese territory. The IDF Spokesperson's Unit provided no comment on the claims in line with the military's position against responding to foreign reports. Jpost.com Staff contributed to this report.
