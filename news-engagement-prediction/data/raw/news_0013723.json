No one expected they would turn things around—let alone complete the largest comeback in Super Bowl history and beat the Falcons, 34-28. \nBut they did. \nViewers everywhere went nuts as the game went into overtime for the first time in Super Bowl history and Tom Brady earned himself his fifth Super Bowl win, breaking Super records Sunday for the most passing yards and the most completions in a single game. \nCelebrities and fans alike turned to Twitter to express their shock and excitement. Even President Trump took the time to congratulate the Patriots. \n“What an amazing comeback and win by the Patriots,” he tweeted. “Tom Brady, Bob Kraft and Coach B are total winners. Wow!” What an amazing comeback and win by the Patriots. Tom Brady, Bob Kraft and Coach B are total winners. Wow! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2017 \nUnfortunately, POTUS left his viewing party when the game seemed out of hand for his preferred team. \nPresident Trump wasn’t the only politician to tweet about the evening. Hillary Clinton also shared congratulations, although they were aimed at Lady Gaga, not Tom Brady. I'm one of 100 million #SuperBowl fans that just went #Gaga for the Lady, & her message to all of us. https://t.co/8AoNqjwr1b — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 6, 2017 \nOther celebrities shared their amusement, shock, and pride at the win by the Patriots. OH MY GOD GREATEST SPORTING EVENT OF MY ENTIRE LIFE!!!! CONGRATULATIONS NEW ENGLAD PATRIOTS!!!! — Chris Evans (@ChrisEvans) February 6, 2017 That comeback was crazier than a movie. Congrats to both teams on an amazing game. Unreal. #SuperBowl — Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) February 6, 2017 Tom. Brady. — Justin Timberlake (@jtimberlake) February 6, 2017 That was 1 of the best games I've EVER been to! Wow. I was high-fiving Pats fans all over the place! Much deserved. Congrats Patriots! #SB51 — Jordin Sparks (@JordinSparks) February 6, 2017 Two weeks ago I said never bet against Tom Brady. I picked Atlanta because I thought the teams were even. Congrats to my friend Bob Kraft! — Larry King (@kingsthings) February 6, 2017 \nAs celebrities tweeted their excitement, other viewers turned to memes to express themselves. Most notably, fans used Lady Gaga's halftime performance to usher in savage memes .
