State-backed TEDCO is trying to fill a funding void for African American business ideas. McKeever \"Mac\" Conwell, a deal team coordinator at TEDCO, said one of the reasons there aren't as many successful startups and entrepreneurs in Maryland's black communities is that it can be difficult to access capital to help build on a good business idea. Mac Conwell is heading up TEDCO's new pre-seed funding effort to provide early capital… more Courtesy of TEDCO \"In talking with other entrepreneurs, we noticed a trend in the black entrepreneurial community, that there is this lack of friends and family funding,\" Conwell said. \"There are a lot of reasons for this, but mainly, there is a wealth gap issue.\" Most entrepreneurs, before seeking seed funding to bring their ideas to market, fund the initial build-out of whatever product or business idea they have with help from their own circles of friends and family. But minority communities often don't have many high-wealth individuals or friends with expendable capital to draw on to help them get their ideas off the ground, Conwell said. The Minority Business Pre-Seed Fund is aiming to fix that. The fund will provide $40,000 to each of 10 entrepreneurs over four quarters. Half of the funding will come from TEDCO and the other half will come from Baltimore's black-owned Harbor Bank's in-house community development corporation. The first few rounds will serve as a pilot test of this new funding model for TEDCO. “The [fund] is designed to be TEDCO’s initial attempt to grow entrepreneurship in underrepresented communities, with the goal of fueling innovation and economic development in Maryland,” TEDCO President John Wasilisin said in a statement. The concept for the fund was born out of new diversity initiatives TEDCO launched last year. Data from between Jan. 1, 2012 and July 1, 2015 showed that once they applied, black businesses were just as successful as actually earning funding through TEDCO's venture fund. The problem was that there weren't as many African American applicants. Wasilisin said the data pointed to a \"funneling issue.\" TEDCO created a diversity outreach work group last year to try and figure out why its programs were not attracting more diverse applicants and how the organization could fix the problem. The work group hosted two listening sessions at Morgan State University and Bowie State University to gather critiques and suggestions from minority entrepreneurs. The new pre-seed fund represents a step in the direction of fixing funding disparities in the black innovation community, Conwell said. \"We are very serious and very intentional about helping the community of tech entrepreneurs in Maryland succeed as a whole, no matter what color, creed or demographic,\" he said. \"We want to see people succeed and be able to grow job creation in the state and we are trying to get better at that every day.\" Harbor Bank's development corporation has been working on its own initiatives to help support minority businesses — including the building of a new incubator in some of its unused office space — and Conwell said the company seemed like the ideal partner for the project. Unlike TEDCO's other, larger funding initiatives, which usually require a company to demonstrate a more developed product and business plan, the pre-seed fund will put money into \"just good ideas,\" Conwell said. People will be able to start applying to the fund on March 1 and groups of TEDCO and outside reviewers will decide which ideas to start funding this year. If the pilot proves successful, Conwell said the program could be expanded in the future to include other minority groups and demographics too.
