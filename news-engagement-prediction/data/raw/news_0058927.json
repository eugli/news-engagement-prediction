Kichcha Sudeep has different looks in this film with hair style going viral among his fans. Before the surgical strike of India (Military confrontation on 29th September 2016) on Pakistan, this cinematic surgical strike was shot six months prior. S Krishna has shown Kichcha Sudeep as Captain Ram a Para commander in the film. This is the highest budget cinema in the career of Kichcha Sudeep made in eight months duration by humble producers SRV Raghunath and Umapathi Films Umapathi. ‘Hebbuli’ with top star of Kannada cinema V Ravichandran playing an important cop role is also elder brother to Kichcha Sudeep in the film. The rabble rousers are Ravishanker, Ravikishan and a few others. For the first time the beautiful Amala Paul is female lead in this film. Arjun Janya music has already hit on top with Sundari Sundari….taking as much of rating what the title song has taken for this film. The much expected film ‘Hebbuli’ with biggest hype in the market has also Kabhir, Sampath Raj, Avinash, Chikkanna and others in the cast. Director and ace cameraman S Krishna from the days of ‘Mungaru Male’ is striking with great sensibilities on silver screen. His debut film ‘Gajakesari’ as director was super hit in the box office. For this ‘Hebbuli’ Krishna is not holding the camera. It is Karunakar doing the most important task of cinematography, Deepu S Kumar editing, Ravi Santhehaklu art work, Harsha in dance direction, Dr Ravi Verma and Vijay in stunts, Saikrishna as designer of posters and others have contributed their expertise for this film.
