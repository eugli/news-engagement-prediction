Gophers forwards Justin Kloos and Tyler Sheehy were able to make the most of the five-minute advantage, each scoring a goal to tie the game 4-4. \nAfter Ohio State grabbed the lead once again in the third period, Minnesota tied it at 5-5 with Vinni Lettieri’s second goal of the night. \nThe Gophers claimed the lead for the first time with Bischoff’s goal with 4:26 to play. The sixth power-play goal of the night set a new school record for the most PPG scored in a single game. \n“It was one of those games we felt like we were never out of it, and the power play got humming when we needed it to,” Gophers head coach Don Lucia said after the game. “It was just one of those nights that pucks were going in.” \nIt was a much-needed victory for Minnesota after it fell 5-4 to the Buckeyes on Feb. 10. With eight regular-season games remaining, the Gophers need to maintain their high level of play to remain in contention for a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. \nOhio State drops to 14-8-6 overall and 5-6-1-1 in the Big Ten after the loss. \nMinnesota will travel to Penn State on Feb. 17-18 for a series against the Nittany Lions, who are fresh off a sweep of the Wisconsin Badgers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T11:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T12:14:12.237+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
