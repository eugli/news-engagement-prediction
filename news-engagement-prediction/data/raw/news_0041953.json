There were eight former Appalachian State players on NFL rosters in 2016, which ties an Appalachian State record for simultaneous players in the NFL (The other season in which Appalachian had eight players in the NFL was during the strike-shortened 1987 season). \nAppalachian State’s 2016 NFL success began in the offseason as Ronald Blair became Appalachian State’s first NFL draft pick since 2013. Blair went on to play all sixteen games for the San Francisco 49er’s, registering 16 tackles, 8 QB hits, and 3 sacks. \nAfter the draft, five Appalachian State players signed undrafted free agent contracts. Unfortunately, all but one of those undrafted free agents were cut after their rookie mini-camps. The lone survivor was Doug Middleton, who was nearly a draft pick by the Philadelphia Eagles , who ended up being one of the NFL’s greatest “Rudy” stories for the New York Jets. \nDespite not being drafted, Middleton made it all the way to the final round of cuts after an impressive preseason that included an interception, a fumble recovery, and 14 tackles. Though he was eventually released during the final round of cuts after his release he was immediately added to the Jets practice squad. After a year of hard work on the practice squad, he was promoted to the active roster for the final four games of the regular season. In that short time, he recorded six tackles, a pass deflection, and scored his first NFL touchdown in the final week of the season on a bizarre kickoff recovery in the end zone against the Buffalo Bills. \nThe NFL offseason wasn’t just good for Appalachian State’s newcomers to the NFL, but it was also good time for former Appalachian State players in free agency. Former Mountaineer Travaris Cadet was resigned to a one year deal with the Saints, and his former teammate Brian Quick was also resigned by his team, the LA Rams, to a one-year deal. \nCadet and Quick both had career highs receptions with Cadet hauling in 40 passes and Quick catching 41. Brian Quick also had the first Rams touchdown since since the team’s return to LA. Cadet finalized his season by scoring touchdowns in the final three consecutive weeks of the season. The NFL offseason wasn’t just good for Appalachian State’s newcomers to the NFL, but it was also a good time for former Appalachian State players in free agency. \nAlthough 2016 held many positives for form App Alumni in the NFL the news wasn’t all perfect. Two former Appalachian State defensive backs failed to make final rosters or practice squads after making preseason rosters. Former Mountaineer cornerback Joel Ross was cut by the Bears several weeks into the preseason, and Demetrius McCray, a former 7th round draft pick, was also a preseason cut by the Jaguars. McCray has worked out for several teams, including the Panthers, and was recently signed to a future-reserve contract with the Seattle Seahawks. \nTwo former app state offensive linemen had no need to worry about preseason cuts after their impressive play in previous seasons. Former Mountaineers Kendall Lamm, Texans, and Daniel Kilgore, 49ers, both continued their impressive play, and had significant roles with their teams. Kilgore started 13 games for the 49ers before tearing his hamstring and suffering his second season ending injury in three season. Kendall Lamm started three games and played in all but one of his teams regular season games, and Lamm is one of two App State alumni that made the playoffs (Lions punter, Sam Martin, is the other). \nLions punter Sam Martin had by far the most impressive season of any Appalachian alumni in the NFL. Martin nearly set the NFL record for highest net punting yards average in a single season (he ended up tying for 2nd all time), and his punting average for the 2016-2017 season was also good enough for 20th all time. Sam Martin was also named the NFC special teams player of the week in week 12. \nTony Washington was the last Appalachian State Alumni to make a NFL roster as he made the Jaguars active roster with just two weeks to go in the regular season. In those two weeks the second year pro proved to be impactful as he made his first career catch in the final week of the season. \nKendall Lamm, Sam Martin, Daniel Kilgore, Doug Middleton, and Ronald Blair are all under contract with their current teams. While Tony Washington, Travaris Cadet, and Brian Quick will all enter into free agency during the offseason. \nThe Apps will look to add to their number of alumni in the NFL ranks this offseason. Marcus Cox and Kennan Gilchrest have both been rated as 7 round/UDFA prospects by CBSSports.com, and both had one extra game to prove their skills. Cox played in the East-West Shrine bowl game, where he had three carries for zero yards and two catches for 14 yards, and Gilchrest played in the NFLPA bowl. Cox and Gilchrest were not the lone seniors that participated in postseason bowls, senior punter Bentlee Critcher was joined by fellow Mountaineer seniors Tyson Fernandez and Barrett Burns in the Tropical Bowl. These players will be with other App State seniors and NFL prospects, such as John Law and Alex Grey, at Appalachian’s pro day in the hopes of impressing NFL scouts, and being selected in the NFL draft or signing an undrafted free agent contract with a NFL team after the draft.
