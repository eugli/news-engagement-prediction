The restaurant today announced plans for its second location, set to open at 2620 Lebanon Pike in the spring of 2018. More than 13,000 square feet will be renovated in the building, formerly home to Johnson's Discount Furniture. The new Party Fowl spot will include two outdoor patios, an upstairs dining area called \"The Coop\" and an upstairs event space, according to a news release. A rendering of Party Fowl's new location on Lebanon Pike Courtesy of Party Fowl Party Fowl is part of a flock of hot chicken restaurants that have popped up in Nashville over the past several years, capitalizing on Nashville's tourism boom and hot chicken's reputation as the city's signature dish. The news release says the Donelson spot will offer a menu crafted by chef Bart Pickens that will be \"consistent\" with the Gulch location, including not only similar \"elevated\" chicken dishes but also a sizable craft beer selection and \"a highly-touted brunch menu.\" Donelson, located northeast of downtown Nashville and close to the airport, has grown into a hotspot for Nashville-area residents looking for slightly more affordable home prices and rents than you can find in trendy spots like nearby East Nashville. “I have a lot of heart and soul invested in Donelson and am very excited to bring Party Fowl to the community,” Austin Smith , Party Fowl's operating owner, said in the news release. “Growing up in the area made me appreciate what it has to offer, and when the opportunity arose to acquire this building in such a central location, I just couldn’t pass it up. We are thrilled to be a part of the revitalization of the downtown area.” Eleanor Kennedy covers Music City's tourism, hospitality and music business industries.
