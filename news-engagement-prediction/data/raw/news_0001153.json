So many times that didn't happen this season,\" Guardiola said. \n\"We were strong in both penalty areas. In terms of the intensity and high pressing it was good. From 2-0 we controlled the game.\" \nGuardiola admitted this week he may have been too quick to assume his players fully understood his football philosophy. \nBut City had taken advantage of the wide-open spaces of the London Stadium to run West Ham ragged in their 5-0 FA Cup victory last month. \nThey picked up where they left off with a devastating counter-attack to open the scoring in the 17th minute after Caballero repaid Guardiola's faith by keeping out Michail Antonio's stinging strike. \nDe Bruyne pounced on Aaron Cresswell's wayward pass on the halfway line, accelerated clear and slipped the ball to Jesus on the right side of the penalty area. \nCarrying on his run without being checked by the negligent Hammers rearguard, De Bruyne looked up to see Jesus guiding a pass back towards him and the Belgian side-footed beyond Darren Randolph with a cool low finish. \n- Sumptuous - \nIt was a sumptuous move that underlined the gulf in class between the teams and City weren't finished yet. \nJust four minutes later, Leroy Sane produced an impudent piece of skill, leaving Sam Byram trailing in his wake with a nimble nutmeg before racing away from Jose Fonte. \nSane made sure not to squander the opening, clipping a cross to the far post, where Silva had been left unmarked to slot into the empty net from close-range. \nHammers boss Slaven Bilic insists his squad are more formidable without Dimitri Payet because they have been united by a determination to prove they can win without the France playmaker, who this week got his wish to rejoin Marseille after effectively downing tools to force the move. \nBut this wasn't the kind of performance to make that sale look a shrewd deal. \nCresswell should have reduced the deficit when Andy Carroll sent him through on goal, but the defender's woeful miscue encapsulated West Ham's deepening gloom. \nAny doubts City would coast to victory were erased in the 39th minute when another rapier thrust cut West Ham apart. \nSane, in sublime form, crossed to Sterling and he unselfishly teed up Jesus for a simple tap-in as West Ham's bewildered defenders looked in vain for an offside flag. \nCity made it four in the 67th minute after Fonte, enduring a debut to forget, responded to Sterling's incisive raid with a clear trip. \nToure converted the penalty to seal City's biggest league win since October and send West Ham's fans scurrying to the exits.
