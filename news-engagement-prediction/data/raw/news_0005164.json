It was Jones who, in the wake of the recent election, poignantly spoke of the \"whitelash against a changing country\" that resulted in the current administration.A former Obama aide forced to resign amidst controversy in 2009, Jones has since then rebuilt his reputation through his work as a speaker, activist, commentator and host of \"The Messy Truth\" on CNN. In addition to serving on several activist charity boards, he's currently the president of The Dream Corps, an organization \"designed to uplift and empower the most vulnerable in our society\" through advocacy projects such as #YesWeCode and Green For All . 3 Tamika Mallory | Civil Rights Activist and Organizer J.
