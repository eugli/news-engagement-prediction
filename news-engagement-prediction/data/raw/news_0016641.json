I trained in Bristol, I was at the BBC in Bristol. \n\"If I stayed living in Bristol, my little boy would still be alive.\" Anne Diamond thinks her son would still be alive if she lived in Bristol (Photo: ITV) Stacey Solomon broke down at her statement (Photo: ITV) She was really sad about it (Photo: ITV) Anne told her not to cry (Photo: ITV) \nStacey then looked really upset by Anne's comments, and teared up. \nBut Anne told her: \"Don't get upset!\" \nSpeaking to the Mirror recently, Anne said: \"Now, 25 years on, my little boy would be a strapping lad like his brothers and I know exactly how he’d look. \n\"The musings of a bereaved mum, maybe. But the pain of loss is nearer the surface than I sometimes think.\" Anne sadly lost her son 25 years ago (Photo: ITV) She said the pain never goes away (Photo: ITV) \nIt came as she welled up on Loose Women just mentioning the anniversary of his death. \nShe continued: \"Once a mum who had lost her child many years before to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome told me, 'After time the pain goes, but the love never does.' \n\"I’m not sure the pain ever does go, actually. Nor the sense of injustice. Because, as I later learned, Sebastian didn’t have to die. We could have saved him – the trouble was, we weren’t living in either New Zealand or Bristol.\" \n*Loose Women continues on ITV1 weekdays at 12.30pm Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T20:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T15:45:06.322+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
