PUBLISHED: 20:19, Fri, Feb 24, 2017 | UPDATED: 20:29, Fri, Feb 24, 2017 GETTY Jean-Claude Juncker wants Britain to agree a 'hefty\" divorce settlement before talks begin \nSeveral member states, including Germany, Italy, France and the Czech Republic, are demanding the eye-watering figure is agreed before discussions over Britain's future relationship with the EU start. \nWith Prime Minister Theresa May hoping to trigger Article 50 next month, Brexit negotiators on both sides are getting ready to battle over what could be a bitter and acrimonious split. \nAnd high on the list of demands from the European Commission is that Britain's settles outstanding payments for EU projects it had committed to before the referendum vote on June 23 last year. \nSome forecasters have put the bill at around €60bn, or £50bn.
