A Penang Botanic Gardens staff member retrieving the AED in response to the emergency situation. \nThe ambulance arrived 15 minutes after they received the call and the medical personnel took over the resuscitation of the ‘patient’ from the staff member before sending him to hospital. \nTask force chairman Dr Luah Lean Wah said Penang Botanic Gardens was one of the ‘hot spots’ with a record of one collapse reported every few months. \n“Sudden cardiac arrests can also happen to normal healthy people. \n“If emergency life-saving skills (such as CPR) are not performed within four minutes, the patient risks brain damage and brain death,” she said recently. \nPenang Botanic Gardens general worker V. Sivakumaran, who had been working there for the past 11 years, said he had encountered three people who collapsed last year. \n“This is a basic emergency response but if we could provide immediate aid on spot, even if it is a minute earlier, this could make a difference between life and death,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:00:30.738+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
