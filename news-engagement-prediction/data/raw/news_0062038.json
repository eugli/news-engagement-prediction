The bear had diarrhoea and her teeth were rotting. \nShelling could be heard in western Mosul, where Iraqi forces are still fighting against Isil, as the volunteer term tended to the animals. \nFour Paws said that after initial treatment it planned to give the zoo owner enough food and medicine for the two animals to last a month, giving him time to find funds to resume caring for the beasts. \nDr Amir Khalil has treated animals in conflict zones across the Middle East Credit: AFP PHOTO / SAFIN HAMED T his is not Dr Khalil’s first experience of extreme veterinary work. The 52-year-old doctor flew into Iraq after the 2003 war to rescue lions at one of Saddam Hussein’s former palaces in Baghdad. \nHe also treated animals in Gaza during the 2014 war between Israel and Hamas, which he described as “the worst in the world”.\n\"These animals were kept in captivity because of us,” Dr Khalil said. “And they don't have the luxury to escape. And they deserve that somebody cares for them”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:28:12.346+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
