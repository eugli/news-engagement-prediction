Key points: General HR McMaster will replace disgraced former national security adviser Michael Flynn The highly regarded military tactician is known for questioning authority Acting adviser General Keith Kellogg to serve as national security council chief of staff \nMr Trump continued to make key appointments in unconventional ways, performing the announcement from a luxurious living room at his Palm Beach club Mar-a-Lago. \n\"He is highly respected by everybody in the military and we're very honoured to have him,\" Mr Trump said of General McMaster. \n\"He's a man of tremendous talent and tremendous experience.\" \nGeneral McMaster is a highly regarded military tactician and strategic thinker, but his selection surprised some observers who wondered how the General, who is known for questioning authority, would deal with a White House that has not welcomed criticism. Michael Flynn's resignation from national security post has the potential to threaten careers all the way to the top. \nHe wrote a book critical of US generals for not taking a tougher line with their political masters during the Vietnam War. \nRetired Army Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg, who had been Mr Trump's acting adviser, will now serve as the national security council chief of staff. \nThe President said John Bolton, a former US ambassador to the United Nations, would serve the administration in another capacity. \nMr Trump spent the weekend considering his options for replacing Mr Flynn. \nHis first choice, retired Vice Admiral Robert Harward, turned down the job last week. \nThe national security adviser is an independent aide to the president and does not require confirmation by the US Senate. \nThe role has varied from administration to administration, but the adviser attends National Security Council meetings along with the heads of the State Department, the Department of Defense and key security agencies. Trump's inner circle may be hard for McMaster to deal with \nGeneral McMaster, 54, is a West Point graduate known as \"HR\" with a PhD in US history from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \nHe was listed as one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people in 2014, partly because of his willingness to buck the system. Steve Bannon, former head of Breitbart News, was appointed Donald Trump's senior counsellor and chief strategist in 2016. His fingerprints are all over the President's immigration ban. \nA combat veteran, he gained renown in the first Gulf War — and was awarded a Silver Star — after he commanded a small troop of the US 2nd Army Cavalry Regiment that destroyed a much larger Iraqi Republican Guard force in 1991 in a place called 73 Easting, for its map coordinates, in what many consider the biggest tank battle since World War II. \nAs one fellow officer put it, referring to Mr Trump's inner circle of aides and speaking on condition of anonymity, the Trump White House \"has its own Republican Guard, which may be harder for him to deal with than the Iraqis were\". \nThe Iraqi Republican Guard was ousted dictator Saddam Hussein's elite military force. \nGeneral McMaster's fame grew after his 1997 book Dereliction of Duty criticised the country's military and political leadership for poor leadership during the Vietnam War. \nIn an interview from July 2014 with the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer in Georgia, where Fort Benning is located, General McMaster, then the base commander, said: \"Some people have a misunderstanding about the Army. \n\"Some people think, hey, you're in the military and everything is super-hierarchical and you're in an environment that is intolerable of criticism and people don't want frank assessments. \n\"I think the opposite is the case … And the commanders that I've worked for, they want frank assessments, they want criticism and feedback.\" \nThat attitude was not always shared by his superiors, and it led to his being passed over for promotion to brigadier general twice, in 2006 and 2007. \nOn General McMaster's third and last try, General David Petraeus — who took himself off the list last week for Mr Trump's national security adviser position — returned from Iraq to head the promotion board that finally gave General McMaster his first general's star. \nABC/wires First posted February 21, 2017 07:12:58 The Trump presidency", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T03:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:25:20.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
