Editor Advertisement \nAnother rich man that comes from a rich family is to be charged in courts for drug-related offences. This time, the man, Ong Jenn, is a grandson of the founder of Metro, and son of the of its former group managing director. \nOng was first charged on Nov 1, 2014 with trafficking in cannabis, as well as possession and consumption of the drug. All these rich people who comes from a rich family, seems like they got too much moeny and time on their hands, thus dabbling in all these nonsense. Their fathers and grandfathers had built an empire from all the hard work, and the third generation have nothing better to do but destroy the good name of the family. \nRich and privileged. These is what the elites are dabbling in. \nDanny Soh \nA.S.S. Contributor Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
