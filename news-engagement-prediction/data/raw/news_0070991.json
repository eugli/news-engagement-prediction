This super simple trick can make a jar of the store-bought stuff taste like you’ve been working on it all day. \nAccording to Sheela Prakash at The Kitchn , all you need to do is simmer the pasta sauce on the stove so it reduces slightly. Pour the jar into a small saucepan, bring it to a boil, then lower the heat and let it simmer for about 10 minutes. You can prepare the pasta and other dishes in the meantime. Reducing the sauce in a small saucepan concentrates the flavor and thickens the texture a bit. You can also add some of your favorite vegetables if you want it to taste even more like homemade. Finish it off with a little bit of the pasta water and you’re all set for a quick and tasty meal.
