She's a Grammy winner and she's ready to party. \nMorris said backstage at the Grammy Awards, after winning for best country solo performance for My Church , that she was going to worship at a different temple for the evening. \n\"I’m going to have my first drink in a month. I fit into the dress and now I’m going to throw down,\" Morris said, wearing a dress by Jenny backstage. Morris said she was with her boyfriend, Ryan Hurd, and her family. The clan was headed to her label's Grammy after-party following the show. \nIt was big night for Morris, nominated four times with one win. And she made it up the stairs without a Jennifer-Lawrence-like fall to accept the award when she was wearing a flowing Michael Costello dress and House of CB heels. \nThat walk was more nerve-wracking to Morris than her fiery duet of Once with Alicia Keyes. \n\"I was more nervous about walking up those steps with those heels and not falling over my dress. That did not happen. But the night is young,\" Morris said. \nSingers Alicia Keys and Maren Morris during The 59th Grammy Awards.
