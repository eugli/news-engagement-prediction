President Rodrigo Duterte and Environment Secretary Gina Lopez attend a meeting in Cebu on January 25, 2017. File photo by Richard Madelo/Presidential Photo \n  Dispelling notions of a rift between Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III and Environment Secretary Gina Lopez, Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Salvador Panelo said Cabinet members only want to \"protect\" Lopez from possible accusations of mining companies. \nPanelo admitted there was some \"arguing\" about the closure of mining operations in the 12th Cabinet meeting but said officials like Dominguez also had Lopez's interests in mind. \nPanelo recalled telling Lopez, \"Secretary Sonny just wants to protect you so that when the mining company sues you, you're going to win.\" \n\"So Sonny Dominguez is just very protective of her,\" he told Palace reporters   14, in a mix of English and Filipino. \n\"She didn't understand it initially but now she realizes that all of us are trying to protect her,\" he added. \nAfter the Cabinet meeting, Malacañang released a statement saying the Cabinet emphasized the importance of following \"due process\" in implementing the order of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) to close 23 mining operations nationwide. \nOn February 9, Lopez and Dominguez met with the Mining Industry Coordinating Council (MICC), in which both agreed to follow due process. \nLopez has insisted from the start that she followed the proper guidelines \"every single step of the way,\" even as some mining companies said they were caught off guard by the closure orders. \nThe Chamber of Mines of the Philippines (COMP) formally opposed Lopez's appointment as Environment Secretary. The group, representing the country's major mining firms, submitted its position paper to the Commission of Appointments (CA) on Monday, February 13. \nThe group said it thinks it will never have a \"productive and rational dialogue\" with Lopez. \nOn Tuesday, the DENR chief announced the cancellation of 75 mineral production sharing agreements (MPSAs) in watersheds all over the country. \nUnfazed by the criticism, Lopez said she will not change her position just to please the powerful CA. \nLopez strongly opposes open pit mining and mining inside watersheds.
