In some cases the cats even have problems picking up food because of their flattened ‘grumpy’ faces.\nA recent study by researchers at the University of Edinburgh concluded that flatter-faced cats were more likely to have breathing problems and that the breathing difficulties were also associated with increased tear staining and a more sedentary lifestyle.\nPersian cat at the Supreme Cat Show at Birmingham NEC Credit: Geoff Pugh/The Telegraph T he problems associated with flat faced or brachycephalic cats have become more common as the breeds have grown in popularity.\nTheir prominent eyes and downturned mouth - making them look as if they are smiling or scowling - have made flat faced breeds the cat of choice.\nKim Kardashian, Paris Hilton and Georgia May Jagger are among the celebrities who have been photographed carrying one.\nFigures from the pet microchipping database Pet Log show that flat-faced British shorthair and Persian cats are among the top ten most popular breeds in the UK, with more than 77,000 registered between them.\nA Scottish fold cat pictured during a show in 2016 Credit: Getty Images B ut the result is growing numbers of such cats suffering from conditions such as tear fluids which can’t drain properly, or infections around the folds of the flattened nose and across the face.\nNow charities are calling for an end to the breeding of the facial characteristics which create such health problems.\nAnimal welfare campaigners want a change in welfare regulations to make the breeding of extreme, unnatural facial features illegal.\nA Persian cat pictured during a world cats show contest organized by the World Cat Federation (WCF) on October 16, 2016 in Istanbul Credit: OZAN KOSE/AFP/Getty Images C laire Bessant, chief executive of International Cat Care, said: “It is very depressing to see the life that has been deliberately dealt to some breeds of cats because of a human desire to develop a certain look.\n“I urge cat lovers to speak out and help others to understand that this is not something we should be doing to cats and not something we should be tolerating.”\nShe added: “One of the best and most beautifully naturally designed animals – the cat – would not normally have any of these problems; we have created them through selective breeding. We should not be encouraging people to breed these cats by calling them 'cute', by being amused at their facial characteristics, or by the fact that they snore. We should never deliberately breed cats for any feature or characteristic that impairs their welfare.”\nThe calls follow similar fears over flat faced dogs\nReality TV star Kim Kardashian holding her flat faced cat, before finding out she is apparently allergic to cats.
