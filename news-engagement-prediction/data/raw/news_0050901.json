Describing his actions at a press conference this morning as 'improvised and not planned', he said the tourist had tried to stop several vehicles and steal a motorbike to head towards the sea before taking the truck laden with gas canisters. The trace of at least one gunshot was visible on the windscreen of the truck, which was small The vehicle, carrying dozens of butane canisters, rammed several cars before it was finally stopped on one of the road's exits A Swedish man identified as 32-year-old Joakim Robin Berggren has reportedly been arrested Respected Catalan newspaper La Vanguardia said Berggren had been arrested in his native Sweden for possession of drugs and drink-driving. It is not known if the reported arrests ended with convictions. It is understood he had flown to Moscow from the Danish capital Copenhagen a day before arriving in Barcelona, and was originally planning to travel to Madrid before changing his mind at the last minute. The unnamed friend he jetted to Barcelona with is thought to have already left Spain. Berggren is being held in a psychiatric centre while Spanish police await information from their Swedish colleagues on whether he has any criminal convictions there. They are also awaiting the results of toxicology tests to determine whether he consumed drugs as well as alcohol before his alleged rampage through Barcelona. Officers started chasing the truck after the driver failed to obey orders to stop from police who had seen it driving at high speeds and dropping part of its load A regional police spokeswoman said the truck was travelling in the wrong direction along a highway near the north eastern Spanish city's famed harbour around 11am The vehicle, carrying dozens of butane canisters, was finally stopped on one of the road's exits The incident was treated as a terrorist incident initially although local authorities confirmed afterwards they had ruled out terrorism as a motive. Catalan Interior Minister Jordi Jane said he believed Berggren ended up taking the truck with the gas cylinders on it only because the driver had left the keys in the ignition. He revealed that when he reached his unnamed hotel in Barcelona with his friend, he told a receptionist he planned to leave the same day on a flight to Madrid before changing his mind. 'His stay in Barcelona opened up new possibilities of night-life, of enjoying a different day and he decided to stay and spend the night in Barcelona.' Berggren is being held in the psychiatric unit at the city's Hospital del Mar. Mr Jane said: 'We are dealing with an individual whose state of mind was affected by his night out and wanted to drive any vehicle he could find at the time. 'Stopping vehicles he tried but failed to get his hands on a motorbike, and finally the truck with the gas bottles on it which he could easily take because the keys were in the ignition and the door was open. Therefore, no planning. At the time it was not known whether the incident was an attempted attack or just a plain robbery Around 20 police officers and at least six police cars were on site, and several gas bottles were lying on the ground Several cars were hit during the attempted escape after the truck was stolen earlier in the day in a nearby district 'Just as he ended up taking the truck, he could have made off with any other vehicle.' Witnesses said the driver - with a shaved head and wearing a green bomber jacket - was 'laughing like a maniac' during the chase. Mr Jane praised police, saying they had 'put their lives at risk with their quick, exemplary and efficient actions' and revealing they saved the life of a Brazilian woman who an officer pulled out of the truck's path as she listened to music on her headphone while she walked near a public square. Last July, a lorry ploughed down the packed seafront promenade in Nice during Bastille Day celebrations, killing 86 people and injuring hundreds of others. A Christmas market in the heart of Berlin was the scene of a similar terrorist atrocity in December, when 12 people died after a truck packed with steel was driven into crowds.
