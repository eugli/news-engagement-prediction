According to the Massachusetts-based songwriter, both tracks feature keyboard synthesizers, samples, synth bass, drums and percussion.\nHowever, it may be a stretch proving that one in court as a great many songs use all those instruments in one form or another.\nCasey pointed out her Ring The Bell was popular (more than 800,000 streams and counting) and was favorably received by Rolling Stone magazine.\nJustin recorded Sorry for his fourth studio album, Purpose, and released the track on October 23, 2015.\nChill: The singer pictured out in Los Angeles back in December", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/PS7l3CEFBfc", "http://www.tmz.com/2017/02/16/justin-bieber-faked-illness-missed-deposition/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/SrjRED1qlKg", "http://www.tmz.com/2016/05/26/justin-bieber-skrillex-sorry-lawsuit/"], "published": "2017-02-17T06:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T18:19:17.613+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
