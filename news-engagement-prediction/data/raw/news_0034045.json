The spin-off from the The LEGO Movie fell short of that movie's $69 million start, but it was in good company. Fifty Shades Darker , which opened at number two with $46 million, a little more than half of the $85 million Fifty Shades of Grey banked two years ago. \nThe third sequel to open this weekend, John Wick: Chapter 2 , may have landed third place, but it was the only one to improve its franchise's performance. It bowed in with $30 million, more than double the $14 million John Wick earned its opening weekend in 2014. It also marks Keanu Reeves' highest opening since the Matrix trilogy, tying with 2008's The Day the Earth Stood Still which also debuted at $30 million. \nAfter three weekends at number one, Split dropped to fourth place under the weight of the newcomers, but not before crossing the $100 million mark. That's a nice number to pass when you consider that over the last ten years on average fewer than 30 movies a year hit that mark. \nFor the full weekend top ten, check out the chart below: 1.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T01:37:04.413+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
