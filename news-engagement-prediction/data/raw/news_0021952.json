Slot to Georgia Links (Photo: Ross Martin/CarolinaBlue, 247Sports) \nWith Georgia head coach Kirby Smart waiting less than 24 hours to replace defensive line coach Tracy Rocker with Tray Scott , Bulldogs' fans are scouring to learn all they can about the new assistant. \nDawgs247 reached out to someone very familiar with Scott. Nathan O'Neal, a defensive line trainer with VIP Training, has helped develop over 40 defensive linemen for college football and has trained dozens of NFL players as well. One of O'Neal's clients is North Carolina defensive end Tomon Fox . As a true freshman in 2016, Fox had a fumble recovery against Georgia in the season opener and four tackles, a sack, and a fumble recovery against Illinois the following week before suffering a season-ending knee injury. \nO'Neal gave his initial thoughts on the addition of Scott to Georgia's staff. \n\"That's a great hire. Coach Scott, number one, he comes from one of the best defensive line coaches of all time as his mentor, and that is Pete Jenkins ,\" O'Neal said. \"Coach Jenkins has developed so many guys who are currently defensive line coaches in college football and the NFL.\" \nScott spent the last two seasons coaching the defensive line at North Carolina, helping develop defensive end Nazair Jones into a two-time All-ACC selection. \n\"He spent last year learning from Gene Chizik , a great defensive mind,\" O'Neal said. \"With one of my guys - Tomon Fox , being there, I have had the opportunity to learn from Coach Scott. From a development standpoint, with the guys at Georgia, Coach Scott is going to do a phenomenal job. He is extremely passionate about how he teaches - they are going to love what he brings to the defensive room. I would be really excited if I was one of the defensive linemen at Georgia.\" \nAccording to O'Neal, Scott will have an easy transition into the Bulldogs' defensive scheme. \n\" Kirby Smart , as a defensive coordinator at Alabama, had defensive line coaches with Pete Jenkins ties,\" O'Neal said. \"So everything they want to do defensively, Coach Scott has learned from the best source in how to develop guys for that system. It's a perfect fit.\" \nWhile Scott has only had two years recruiting as an on-the-field coach at the FBS level, O'Neal feels he has a chance to become a stout addition for Georgia. \n\"He is a young, hungry guy,\" O'Neal said. \"He is very honest and up front with his recruits - which is really becoming the common factor on that Georgia staff. He is going to help Kirby Smart lock down the state of Georgia for Georgia.\" Not a member?

The Seminoles' commitment will likely be hearing from Scott soon. \n\"I absolutely expect Coach Scott to come after Robert,\" O'Neal said. \" Kirby Smart loves Robert Cooper , so he will make sure Coach Scott gets on that quickly, and knowing what Coach Scott looks for in his defensive tackles, nose tackles, Cooper fits that to a 'T.\" \n(What's next for the Bulldogs?
