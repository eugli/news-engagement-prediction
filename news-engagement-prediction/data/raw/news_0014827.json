Could   \nA cancer sufferer who decided to plan his own funeral after he was given 18 months to live has talked of his joy after he was left with no trace of the disease after taking a new “wonder drug ”. \nBob Berry agreed to be one of just 12 people in the world to take part in a trial for the new drug, which is the first time it has been tested on humans. \nAnd after a year on, Bob, a former machine operator from Stockport, has just celebrated his 60th birthday – a milestone which he was told he would not reach. \nThe once growing tumour has now vanished from the screens. \nBob is one of just three people to take part in the trial at The Christie Hospital in Manchester. \nHe was diagnosed with lung cancer three years ago, after suffering pains in his shoulder and numbness. An X-ray was ordered which revealed a tumour.

I was going to call the undertakers and prepare everything. \n“But now thanks to this - what I call 'wonder drug' - I can cancel that for a bit. \n“When they told me about this drug, I thought 'Well, I've got nothing to lose and if it doesn't work on me it might help someone else'. \n“I've been on it for 12 months now and I've never felt ill throughout it. \n\"Now I'm living life like every day is my last. He has been left with no trace of the disease (Photo: Handout) \n“I celebrated my 60th birthday four weeks ago and I never thought I'd be alive to do that. \n“It's not cured the growth but it has shrunk it down so they can't see it on the screens any more - which is amazing. \n“I hope the drug becomes readily available now.” \nThe study into the drug which is combined with immunotherapy, which has not been named, is taking place at only six centres worldwide. \nBob, who takes his great great-nieces to their ballet class every week, \nsays the trial has extended his life.

Anyone who is offered a clinical trial should seriously consider it.” \nBob’s consultant at The Christie, Dr Matthew Krebs, said: “Bob has had a phenomenal response to taking part in this clinical trial. \n“His most recent scans show that he’s had a complete response with no apparent trace of tumour in his body. Bob with Dr Matthew Krebs at the Christie, Manchester (Photo: Manchester Evening News) \n“We will need to monitor Bob closely with regular scans to assess how durable this response will be. \n“As it is a combined study with a brand new drug, we still have a lot of further research to do before we can establish how these findings can help more patients like “Bob in the future as cancer is a complex disease and not every patient responds as well as this.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T06:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:36:40.913+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
