The manager said Beesly was sneaking drinks. He added , \"She is not welcome at this restaurant chain ever again.\" \nBeesly owes her Chili's access to the actress who played Beesly, Jenna Fischer. On Monday, she tweeted a photo of herself in front of a Chili's with the question, \"Should I try to go in?\" The next day, Chili's issued a news release, announcing the ban was no longer.
