Bradley Walsh jumps to Jenny Ryan’s defence as contestant on The Chase calls her ‘chubby cheeks’ \nAccording to BroadcastNow , The Family Chase will see a team of four relatives gearing up to win a cash pot – a welcome contrast to the strangers that contestants are usually paired up with. \nIt will reportedly air in a Saturday teatime slot, and ITV bosses are hoping that it can bring a new ‘dynamic’ to the hugely popular show. \nMichael Kelpie, an executive producer on The Chase, said: ‘They know each other’s strengths and weaknesses, they’ve discussed a strategy beforehand but of course, that can all mean nothing when they go face-to-face against one of the UK’s finest quiz brains.’ \n‘The Family Chase complements both the daytime weekday and celebrity primetime shows. With even more fun and banter between Bradley, chasers and the families, it still delivers all the core values that has made The Chase a firm favourite with the viewers.’ \nITV are yet to formerly confirm the show – but we’re seriously hoping that this happens and have contacted them to find out a bit more \nWe think this is a dazzling story and so do you!
