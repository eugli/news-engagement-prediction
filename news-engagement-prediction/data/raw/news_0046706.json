Not least the arthritic tadpoles that shuffle around his scrotum, clutching their tiny hearts every time they hear Jerry’s voice, muffled by his adult nappy.” \nLast year Boyle hit out at the newspaper for deleting parts of a column which described the 85-year-old media mogul as struggling “to sire another generation… by squeezing out his sperm like stale toothpaste.” Related...

Imagine the adrenalin surge of feeling responsible for a huge election upset.” Rex Features Rupert Murdoch with his wife Jerry Hall \nPresident Trump has launched a series of attacks on the US media, labelling news outlets that question him “the enemy of the American people.” \nLast week he took part in one of the most extraordinary White House press conferences in political history in which he ranted about “fake news” outlets, goaded journalists and lied about the extent of his election victory. \n“Looking back,” Boyle suggests: “ the Harambe situation is the closest working model we have for a Trump presidency.” \nIn July Boyle had another column pulled from the Guardian because of a single word, on the grounds of taste.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T20:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T16:15:04.891+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
