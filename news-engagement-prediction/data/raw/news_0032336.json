(KABC) -- Nearly 200,000 people who were ordered to leave their homes out of fear that the Oroville Dam spillway could collapse may not be able to return home until the barrier is fixed, officials said.At a Monday news conference, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea did not specify how long the repairs would take and offered no timetable for when the evacuation order would be lifted.Meanwhile, water levels dropped Monday at Lake Oroville, stopping water from spilling over the 770-foot-tall dam's emergency spillway, slightly easing the fears of a catastrophic spillway collapse.But with more rain expected later in the week, time was running short to fix the damage ahead of the storms.

This is why 188,000 residents from three counties were told to evacuate .As of late Sunday night, no more water was flowing over the emergency spillway. Also late Sunday, Gov. Jerry Brown issued an emergency order to fortify authorities' response to the emergency at the dam and help with evacuations.The hole started out small last week, but the problem grew worse. \nEngineers spotted this hole on the concrete lip of the Oroville Dam's emergency spillway. When asked if the spillway was supposed to handle far more water, Bill Croyle, the acting head of the California Department of Water Resources , said he was \"not sure anything went wrong\" on the damaged spillway.Croyle said sometimes low-flow water can be high energy and cause more damage than expected. His comments came after officials assured residents for days that the damage was nothing to be concerned, then ordered everyone to get out in an hour.The sudden evacuation panicked residents, who scrambled to get their belongings into cars and then grew angry as they sat in bumper-to-bumper traffic hours after the evacuation order was given.Officials said crews will continue releasing as much as 100,000 cubic feet per second from the main spillway to try and reduce the dam's level by 50 feet ahead of storms forecast to reach the area Wednesday and Thursday.\"The idea behind that strategy was to reduce the erosion and stop the erosion, and now the site is starting to de-water and drain out,\" Croyle said.

It's not clear how damage to the two spillways will affect long-term water releases from the dam. The Associated Press contributed to this report.
