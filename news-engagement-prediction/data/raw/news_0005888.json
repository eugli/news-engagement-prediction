This is the first Black History Month formally celebrated with Donald Trump as president. \nAnd, yeah, it’s going about as well as expected so far. \nWednesday began with a “ listening session ” at the White House, with guests like Trump’s two black friends, Ben Carson and Omarosa Manigault. During the event, Trump gave some… remarks, I guess you’d call them? \nIn these remarks, Trump honored Martin Luther King Jr…. by talking about the media mistakenly reporting that Trump had removed his bust from the Oval Office. Here is a transcript of President Trump's comments on Dr. Martin Luther King at his Black History Month gathering this morning. pic.twitter.com/qHq9i1Ligg \n— Daniel Dale (@ddale8) February 1, 2017 \n(For the record, the reporter who said that quickly corrected his report and apologized. His apology was accepted by Press Secretary Sean Spicer.) \nTrump spent a significant amount of his Black History Month remarks complaining about “fake news.” The president did make an attempt to mention great figures in black history. \nThis included Frederick Douglass , the 19th century abolitionist. \nExcept that based on how Trump spoke, it sounded like he has absolutely no idea who Douglass was, and actually believes Douglass is still alive. He said, \nDouglass is an example of somebody who has done an amazing job that is being recognized more and more, I notice. \nPlease note the present tenses in “who has,” “that is” and “I notice.” Here is the full clip. Decide for yourself if Trump knows that Douglass has been dead for over 100 years. I could go either way. pic.twitter.com/EQZUhI1Xrq \n— Leon Wolf (@LeonHWolf) February 1, 2017 A whole lot of folks on Twitter sure seemed to notice Trump’s use of the present tense on Douglass. Twitter Twitter Some were almost comforted by this revelation that Trump may think Douglass is a living person. Twitter Some were inspired to write some neat fan fiction. Twitter And others had some fun prank ideas somebody should probably pursue. Twitter Even the New York Times had to get in on the trolling. Twitter Press Secretary Spicer was asked about Trump’s comments on Douglass on Wednesday afternoon. \nIn case you wanted one prime example of why it’s important to have diversity on your team, just check out Spicer’s answer in the video. \nA reporter asked him to explain exactly what Trump meant by saying Douglass was being recognized more and more. \nSpicer responded, \nI think he wants to highlight the contributions that he has made, and I think through a lot of the actions and statements that he’s going to make, I think the contributions of Frederick Douglass will become more and more. \nSo, uh… kind of seems like Spicer doesn’t know who Douglass is — or that he’s been dead for over 100 years — either. Even if Trump did just make a grammar mistake when speaking about Douglass, it wasn’t exactly the most inspiring Black History Month speech from a president. \nI mean, Trump’s list of historical figures and their achievements reads like a second grader in a heavily white town. \nHe’s going to have to try harder if he really wants to be a president for all Americans. \nLuckily for Trump, there’s a whole month ahead filled with programming around black history. Maybe he can learn something. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
