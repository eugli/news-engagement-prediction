Hollingworth ignored psychiatric advice: report \nThe commission found that in July 1993 Elliot admitted to the then Archbishop of Brisbane, Dr Hollingworth, that he abused BYB and his brother. \nDr Hollingworth met with BYB the following month. \n\"We are satisfied that during this meeting BYB told Dr Hollingworth that Elliot was a paedophile and Elliot had abused him over a number of years,\" the commission's report details. \nDr Hollingworth also contacted psychiatrist John Slaughter to provide a psychiatric assessment of Elliot. \n\"By the the second consultation with Elliot he [Dr Slaughter] had formed an opinion that Elliot was a paedophile and that his personality type was untreatable,\" the report details. \nLater that year Dr Hollingworth permitted Elliot to continue in his role as rector of Dalby until his retirement in 1998. \n\"We are satisfied that Dr Hollingworth's decision to permit Elliot to continue in the ministry was a serious error of judgment which focused overly on Elliot's needs to the exclusion of those of BYB and his family and of the need to protect children more generally,\" the report found. \n\"We are also satisfied that, in making this decision, Dr Hollingworth failed to take into account the advice that Dr Slaughter had given him.\" Inappropriate and insensitive letter \nThe commission also found a letter written by Dr Hollingworth to BYB's brother in 1995 was \"inappropriate and insensitive\". \nDr Hollingworth was responding to BYB's brother questioning as to why he had allowed Elliot to continue in the ministry.
