The blindfold is then released as the wrestler sits up, face-first, into the naked butt of another wrestler. \nStubbs, who has a sophomore son on the team, said he was helping with drills at practice when the incident occurred. He said he took the video to the school administration this past Monday, and they suspended Johnson at that time. He has since been fired. \n“There are some people that are even upset that I took the video and that I have the video,” Stubbs said. “There’s people that are like, ‘Boys will be boys, that’s okay.’ That’s the head coach that’s instigating it, and he got suspended from the team. But they let him back in and he was addressing the students (on Thursday) in a tirade that someone’s trying to ruin his life with this video. I heard him up there (in the wrestling room) yelling and screaming, so I went up there and pulled my kid out of that team meeting.” \nHans released a statement Friday afternoon. “This is very concerning and the Douglas County School District does not tolerate inappropriate conduct by staff members. Upon learning of this incident, we immediately contacted law enforcement and began our own investigation. The Chaparral High School wrestling coach is no longer employed by the Douglas County School District. The safety and well-being of our students is our priority and actions of this nature will not be tolerated.” \nStubbs said that both he and his son have received backlash for his role in filming, and then releasing, the video. \n“I was going to deal with it through the school and all that, but my son has started to get threatening social media posts,” Stubbs said. “The social media message that the team captain sent to my son says, “You and your dad are lame excuses for men. You better avoid me and my family like the plague.’ So I just got a real problem that I don’t think this is being taken seriously.” \nStubbs said the Chaparral administration talked to the student who sent his son the threatening message, but that no further action was taken. Stubbs also said the administration took the video to the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office, where they were told “there’s nothing on that video that they can press charges for.” \nStubbs said the incident captured on video is indicative of a tangible culture shift under Johnson, who was in his first year running the program. \n“It’s a huge change from last year—he berates kids, and yells at them, and makes them not want to wrestle anymore,” Stubbs said. “Now, because of the backlash, my kid can’t go to wrestling practice anymore. How is he supposed to go to practice now when the team captains and the coach are the ones doing the prank?” \nCalls and messages to the Chaparral administration were not returned. \nThe Douglas County School District released the following statement Friday afternoon: \n“This is very concerning and the Douglas County School District does not tolerate inappropriate conduct by staff members. Upon learning of this incident, we immediately contacted law enforcement and began our own investigation. The Chaparral High School wrestling coach is no longer employed by the Douglas County School District. \n“The safety and well-being of our students is our priority and actions of this nature will not be tolerated.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:10:04.107+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
