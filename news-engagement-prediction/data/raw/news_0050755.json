'Big mistake' \nMPs are expected to give the scheme the final seal of approval this week when it returns to the Commons from the Lords. \nBut the libertarian lobby group says government-managed large infrastructure projects have a poor record of being delivered on budget, with one project in the USA overrunning by 190%. \nIn the UK, the Jubilee line extension was forecast to cost £2.1 billion, but the bill rose to £3.5bn, partly because of huge cost overruns during construction. Channel Tunnel costs swelled by 80%. \nJohn O'Connell, chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: \"All the evidence shows that big government projects are delivered way over budget and almost never to deadline, so to allocate tens of billions of taxpayers' money to this white elephant is a big mistake.\" \nIn a 2014 paper , Bent Flyvbjerg, Professor of Major Programme Management at Oxford University, laid out what he called the iron law of megaprojects: \"Over budget, over time, over and over again.\" 'Big infrastructure rarely delivers' \nFriends of the Earth, who support high-speed rail when it diverts people from flying, say HS2 is the wrong scheme. \nThey complain it doesn't join up to HS1 - the line that joins London to the continent - so doesn't provide the possibility of getting on a train in the North and getting off in Brussels or Paris. Image copyright Reuters Image caption The plan has attracted criticism from local and national groups \nCraig Bennett, FoE's director, told BBC News: \"We think the money would be much better spent on a range of much smaller sustainable transport infrastructure projects to deliver real improvements to regular commuters and other train travellers over a far quicker timescale.\" \n\"Big infrastructure rarely delivers on its promises. That's why we think Hinkley C nuclear station is also a waste of money. 'Tough grip on costs' \n\"For the Hinkley subsidy, you could fund the mother of all national energy efficiency retrofit programmes for millions of homes. That would deliver carbon savings far quicker, would make a real improvement to peoples' lives.\" \nThe former Chancellor George Osborne kick-started the drive towards major projects as a way of creating jobs. HS2 is widely supported by councils in the North of England and has received backing by MPs across the parties. \nThe Department for Transport said: \"HS2 will become the backbone of our national rail network - creating more seats for passengers, supporting growth and regeneration and helping us build an economy that works for all. \n\"We are keeping a tough grip on costs and the project is on time and on budget at £55.7bn.\" \nFollow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T07:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T02:31:31.769+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
