I don't know, I'll just have to see what's best for me and my career and also for my family. ROB JEFFERIES/GETTY IMAGES \nMalakai Fekitoa on the charge against the Hurricanes during last year's Super Rugby campaign. \n\"But I love it down here, it's been fun.\" \nFekitoa, who will play his 50th game for the Highlanders against the Chiefs in Dunedin on Friday night, said \"a few\" overseas clubs had been in touch with him and his management regarding a change next year. \n\"I can't say much about it, but the door has been knocking, yeah.\" \nSmith, who recently rebuffed a huge offer from French side Pau to stay in New Zealand through to 2020, said Fekitoa represented what the Highlanders are about. Ad Feedback \n\"I'd love to see Malakai sign for another 20 years,\" he said. \"He's awesome and he's great for the Highlanders.\" \nHowever, as good as he was his first two years with the team after moving south from the Blues, Fekitoa hit a speed bump last year. \nUnforced errors crept into his game and his ability to break teams open with his raw power mostly escaped him. \nIt resulted in him battling for game time in the black jersey during last year's end-of-year-tour, with Chiefs midfielder Anton Lienert-Brown unseating him in the pecking order. \n\"Obviously it didn't go well last year towards the end,\" Fekitoa said. \"The [British and Irish] Lions are coming up, now I have an opportunity to start again tomorrow against the Chiefs. \n\"Hopefully I can do my job and get my confidence back and enjoy my footy.\" \nFekitoa will be matched up with Lienert-Brown under the roof in the season opener, and is relishing the opportunity to test himself against a player he said has got certain skills other midfielders in the country don't have. \nBut Tongan-born Fekitoa, who has played 23 tests for the All Blacks, has been busy during the off-season working on the new and improved version of himself. \nHe said increasing his speed was a \"massive work-on\" during the break, while he had also been focussing on improving his footwork. \nï»¿ \"I've always wanted to be the best in the world at what I do as a midfielder, as a centre,\" Fekitoa said. \nFekitoa said reaching the 50-match milestone was something he was proud of, and he would celebrate with friends and family post match.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T11:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:43:40.667+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
