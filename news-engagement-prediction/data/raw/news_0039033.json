The 57-year-old gets up in the dark to open his family newsagents in Edinburgh at 3am every day.\nSo he was over the moon in April 2015 when the Government said over-55s could cash in their entire pensions.\nDavid, who began working in the shop aged 17, had saved £8,740 into a Friends Life pension in the Nineties and early 2000s.\nThe new rules meant he could use the money to finish the home improvements he'd been working on — and even bring forward his retirement by a few years.\nSold a bad deal: Edinburgh newsagent David Borthwick saved £8,740 into a Friends Life pension in the Nineties and early 2000s\nBut when David asked for the money, he found the insurer had tied him into an extraordinary Catch-22 situation.\nIt turned out that years of high charges had eaten away most of his savings.\nHis £8,740 pot was worth around £2,268 and getting smaller by the day. Friends Life was deducting an astonishing £400 a year for management and 'service' fees.\nThe charges were so high that the insurer admitted his pot would be worth nothing by his 65th birthday.\nHOW THIS IS MONEY CAN HELP How much do you need to save for retirement: Use our pension calculator and get free guides When David saw a '£0.00' future pension estimate in the documents the company sent him, he tried to withdraw everything.\nBut under a clause in the contract, Friends Life barred David from cashing in his pension for another seven years.\nHe was locked into the shoddy deal until his 'retirement date' — June 2024 — which was determined when he signed up in 1992.\nIn a final blow, David couldn't even switch to a cheaper plan that would leave some money left.\nFor all those years, they never told me they were gradually taking all the money I had paid in and I could never get anything back — it's daylight robbery In theory, moving to a low-cost plan with a firm such as Hargreaves Lansdown or AJ Bell would have cut his fees to £10 a year.\nBut Friends Life told him the entire fund would be 'reduced to zero' if he switched.\nSo David's pension was worthless to him — yet provided a tidy £400 a year income to his insurer, which is owned by Aviva.\nHe says: 'I was horrified to see how little my savings were worth. For all those years, they never told me they were gradually taking all the money I had paid in and I could never get anything back — it's daylight robbery.'\nMillions of savers were sold pension plans in the Nineties with clauses that said they couldn't access the cash until retirement.\nSTEVE WEBB ANSWERS YOUR PENSION QUESTIONS My state pension forecast says I'm due full £155, but surely it's wrong because I contracted out? I feel like I've been conned out of a full state pension: how do I know if Government calculations of what I am due are correct? My wife has a short time to live and we are trying to make sure I get as much of her state and private pensions as possible - how do we keep hold of her savings? Must older married women wait for husbands to reach retirement age to get state pension? I had to forfeit my late wife's pension just because I remarried - how is this fair? Should I transfer my £16k local government pension pot into a private scheme? I don't pay tax but do contribute to a pension - can I get tax relief on my payments? I divorced in 1972 and became a single working mum - how did this affect my state pension? Will my wife get a state pension increase if I die before she does? The high-charging plans were flogged by doorstep salesmen, who pocketed giant commissions.\nOften the contract also included a so-called exit penalty if the saver tried to switch to another company before they retired.\nDavid was sold his plan by local financial adviser Dundee & Edinburgh Insurance Services.\nHe paid in £8,740 between 1992 and 2003 — but only realised the value was shrinking in November 2015, when he received a statement from Friends Life.\nExamining the charges, he saw deductions of £4.40 for a 'monthly service fee' and £28.68 because he had stopped paying in.\nThis fee was being applied because a clause in the contract says David has to pay in £5,000 annually for 32 years or face 'additional charges'.\nBeing a small business owner, David says his income was never going to be predictable. He says he was never aware of the onerous clause, either.\nFriends Life was also levying a 1.25 per cent 'annual management charge'. That meant in total the deductions came to £425.11 a year.\nThe exit penalty, that appears to have been calculated using a complex formula, was so large that it would have wiped out the fund if he moved it to another firm.\nBy December 2016, the fund had fallen another £341 and was worth around £1,900 — even though the stock market had risen 14 per cent in the intervening months.\nDavid complained to Friends Life about the fees, but was told his complaint was about mis-selling and should be directed to the financial adviser who sold him the plan.\nDundee & Edinburgh Insurance Services is no longer trading, so Friends Life suggested he go to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme for redress, or the ombudsman, which rules in disputes between companies and customers.\nFormer pensions minister Baroness Ros Altmann said policies such as the one David was sold should be outlawed\nWhen Money Mail intervened, Friends Life sprang into action. Its owner, Aviva, now accepts the pension's terms and conditions may not have been properly explained to David by his financial adviser.\nIt has recalculated the charges without the penalties and given him a new fund value of £16,249.\nDavid must still pay an exit penalty of around 2.4 per cent, which will leave £15,851 if he wants to move to another provider.\nHe plans to do this and take out some of his tax-free cash to put towards a glass balcony he is building for his home.\nBaroness Ros Altmann, the former pensions minister, says: 'These type of policies should be outlawed completely.\n'They're an outrage and I hope the Government will clamp down on insurers.'\nOn April 1, the Government will introduce a 1 per cent cap on charges when over-55s exit their old workplace pensions.\nAviva says it has now made changes to the policy, and David's exit fee will be even less if he waits until April to withdraw his cash.\nBut Aviva would not say whether the cap would have applied if David's policy terms had remained unaltered.\nA spokesman for Friends Life says: 'The customer was required to commit to a specific level of saving per year as part of the policy contract, with additional charges incurred should customer premiums reduce or cease.\n'Having reviewed this customer's specific situation, we have identified that his retirement plan was not set up in the most relevant way for his circumstances.\n'We will therefore amend his retirement plan to ensure he is not financially disadvantaged.\n'We accept that this should not have happened and we apologise to Mr Borthwick.'\nmoney.mail@dailymail.co.uk\nDeals Of The Week Top rate: 5% on up to £2.500 FlexDirect 1.1% easy access rate Top savings deal Spend £10, get £15 bonus in ANY store New members only Best buy low rate card 5.85% APR £7+ in monthly rewards Blue Rewards", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=", "http://www.moneysupermarket.com/current-accounts/details/?productCode=CUR_nationwide_FlexDirect_Tier01_1_2500&index=5&count=11&selectedProductId=CUR_nationwide_FlexDirect_Tier01_1_2500&gid=CUR_OVERDRAFT&page=&source=THISMO1", "http://www.moneysupermarket.com/credit-cards/details/?productCode=CC_AA_TRANSFER_PLUS_CARD&index=3&count=106&selectedProductId=CC_AA_TRANSFER_PLUS_CARD&gid=CC_ALLCARDS&page=&source=THISMO1", "http://www.moneysupermarket.com/current-accounts/details/?productCode=CUR_barclaybnk_BankAcc_BlueRewards_tier_01_0_0&index=2&count=11&selectedProductId=CUR_barclaybnk_BankAcc_BlueRewards_tier_01_0_0&gid=CUR_OVERDRAFT&page=&source=THISMO1", "http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/pensioncalculator", "http://www.quidco.com/ref?cid=4831&utm_source=ThisisMoney&utm_campaign=ThisisMoney_AffiliateArticle&utm_medium=AffiliateArticle", "http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/pensioncalculator/index.html", "http://www.moneysupermarket.com/shop/third-party-promotion-click/?product_sku=SAV_RCIBANK_48F18975BBD543A59694F181F61CBE1C&source=TM1&channel_id=116"], "published": "2017-02-15T00:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T02:12:54.298+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
