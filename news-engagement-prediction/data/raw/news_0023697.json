are all alive and living in prisons across the US, where they are fighting the death penalty or just living out their life sentences.\nMost of them are just ordinary looking men with no hint of the terror they caused or the grisly deeds they did with their victims’ bodies.\nSome of them killed only women, others only men and a handful killed their way through genders and across different age groups.\nDozens of serial killers are incarcerated and largely forgotten, except by their victims’ families.\nThese are just a few of the men who wreaked havoc in local communities until they were

Aged 12, he moved to Miami to live with his sexually abusive father, Gustavo.\nRORY Conde’s life as a serial killer is believed to have begun eight years after he married at 21 to a 15-year-old girl.\nThe couple moved to a condominium off the Tamiami Trail, the southernmost section of Highway 41 between Tampa and Miami and had two children.\nOnce noted for its scenic vistas of Florida wildlife, the Highway just outside Miami runs into a strip of low rent motels, porn shops and strip bars.\nIt was along here that Roy Conde, the man who would become known as the Tamiami Trail Strangler would lurk.\nWhen his sex life with his wife petered out, Conde began to disappear at night and developed an addiction to prostitutes he picked up on Highway 41.\nWhen his wife found out about Conde’s prostitute habit, she left him, taking the children.\nSoon afterwards, at the age of 29, in September, 1994, Conde began to kill.\nHis first known victim was transvestite prostitute, Lazaro Comesana, who Conde killed because he only found out that Lazaro was male during sex.\nNecole Schneider fell victim to Conde in 1994.

When police found a second victim strangled, redressed and her body abandoned they suspected a serial killer.\nConde was apparently extremely paranoid he would be discovered, and the killings had attracted wide coverage on television and in local newspapers.\nBut his rage at losing his family drove him to kill again.\nIn November, he killed prostitute Charity Fay Nava.\nConde blamed prostitutes for the breakup of his marriage and took his revenge out on them.
