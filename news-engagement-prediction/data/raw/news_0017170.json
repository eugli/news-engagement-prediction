Marchers carried the Iran ian flag and banners saying: “Thanks Mr. Trump for showing the real face of America.” \n“America and Trump cannot do a damn thing. We are ready to sacrifice our lives for our leader”, a young Iran ian man told state TV in a reference to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. \nLast week, Trump put Iran “on notice” in reaction to a Jan. 29 Iran ian missile test and imposed fresh sanctions on individuals and entities. Iran said it will not halt its missile program. \nIran ian leading religious and political figures, including Pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani had called on Iran ians to join the rally on Friday to “show their unbreakable ties with the Supreme Leader and the Islamic Republic”.

VIGILANT \nIn a speech marking the revolution’s anniversary, Rouhani urged Iran ’s faction-ridden elite to seek unity amid increased tensions with the United States. \n“Some inexperienced figures in the region and America are threatening Iran ... They should know that the language of threats has never worked with Iran ,” Rouhani told the crowd at Azadi Square. \n“Our nation is vigilant and will make those threatening Iran regret it ... They should learn to respect Iran and Iran ians ... We will strongly confront any war-mongering policies.” \nThe rallies were rife with anti-U.S. and anti-Israeli sentiment. Some carried pictures of Trump , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and British Prime Minister Theresa May captioned “Death to the Devil Triangle”. \n“This turnout of people is a strong response to false remarks by the new leaders of America,” Rouhani told state TV , which said millions had turned out at rallies across Iran . \nU.S. flags were burned as is traditional although many Iran ians on social media such as Twitter and Facebook used the hashtag #LoveBeyondFlags to urge an end to flag-burning during the anniversary. \nThey also thanked Americans for opposing Trump ’s executive order banning entry to the United States to travellers from seven mainly Muslim countries, including Iran . Trump ’s travel ban is being challenged in U.S. courts. \nSome marchers carried banners that read : “Thanks to American people for supporting Muslims”. \nBoth U.S.-based social media sites are blocked in Iran by a wide-reaching government censor but they are still commonly used by millions of Iran ians who use special software to get around the restrictions. Iran ian officials, including Khamenei, have Twitter and Facebook accounts despite the ban. \nTrump has criticized a nuclear deal reached between Iran , the United States and other major powers in 2015 aimed at curbing the country’s nuclear work. Most of the sanctions imposed on Iran were lifted last year under the deal. \nRouhani defended the deal, which his hardline rivals oppose as a concession to pressure from Washington, saying it protected the Islamic Republic’s rights to nuclear power, ending Iran ’s political isolation and crippling economic sanctions.
