Cheltenham, which is attended by more than 260,000 racing fans over four days, is introducing the limit after two professional footballers were pictured urinating into plastic cups last year, with one then throwing his over the balcony. Those hoping to buy a round of several pints will be limited to just four at a time. The cap will apply to all alcoholic drinks, including wine, beer and spirits Last year, 265,000 pints of Guinness, 120,000 bottles of wine and 20,000 bottles of champagne were purchased from its 26 bars. Mr Renton told The Times: ‘It’s not want we want, it’s not the sort of publicity we want for the racecourse. We want to ensure all can enjoy their race-going unhindered by people drinking irresponsibly. ‘We are reinforcing our standard procedures – increasing the training of staff and briefing of managers, and ensured that every member of bar staff has to have watched a video on responsible drinking.’ Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T08:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T07:16:59.735+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
