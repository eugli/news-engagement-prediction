The data found that growing wheat for bread had the biggest influence on producing greenhouse gases, mainly through the use of fertiliser.\nThis was followed by milling and the bakery stage of the process.\nThe researchers say there needs to be shared responsibility for the environmental costs of making bread, including fertiliser producers, farmers, millers, bakers, retailers and consumers.", "external_links": ["http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4CBE/production/_94864691_thinkstockphotos-55842520.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1853E/production/_94864699_thinkstockphotos-507633388.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-27T21:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:37:08.182+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
