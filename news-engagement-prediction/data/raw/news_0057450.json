Here is our latest batch of reviews-in-a-nutshell.\nGreat Good ★★★★\nFair ★★★ Bad ★★ Bomb ★\n‘Virginia Woolf’ is an emotional voyeur’s delight ★★★★\nWhat would Lady Macbeth have become if she had failed in goading her husband to commit regicide? No doubt some medieval version of Martha, the vicious, alcoholic harridan in “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” Yet to call Edward Albee’s 1962 play misogynistic would be to miss the playwright’s scathing indictment of all humanity, and particularly of the “Leave It to Beaver” illusions of 1950s WASP society.\nThis is a playwright who takes no prisoners, and Space 55 Ensemble does justice to Albee’s serrated wordplay and stygian melodrama in an intimate production that gives the audience a fly-on-the-wall view of the emotional carnage. Shari Watts plays Martha with the over-the-top intensity that is absolutely essential to the role, while Duane Daniels deftly distills the complex cocktail of cynical erudition and smoldering nihilism in her husband, George, whose pecked-rooster routine turns out to be a classic rope-a-dope in their 20-year war of words. Equally effective are supporting players Megan Holcomb and Paul Kolecki as a young couple caught in the verbal crossfire — even if they hardly live up to the Normal Rockwell ideal themselves.\nMORE ARTS: 'Riders of the Purple Sage' is Arizona Opera's first-ever world premiere | Top 13 musicals and plays for February in Phoenix | Arizona Women's Orchestra aims to empower female musicians, foster representation \nBottom line: Brutally funny and provocatively cerebral, “Virginia Woolf” relentlessly ratchets up the tension so you barely notice the 3½-hour running time (with two intermissions). OK, maybe your backside will notice.\nDetails: Reviewed Sunday, Feb. 19. Continues through Sunday, March 5. Space 55, 636 E.

The production has its flaws. Trimmed to 80 minutes, it moves so fast it’s sometimes hard to follow, and student actor Quinn Johnson doesn’t quite turn the dial of Titus’ insanity as high as it needs to go. But the performance is never boring, and it succeeds at what seems to be its aim: to force theatergoers to squirm at their own laughter.\nAs an ironical add-on in a play that climaxes with cannibalism, the production also includes an element of “food design”: a selection of candies with ancient Roman flavor profiles, including an olive marshmallow, served to the front row during the performance and to the rest of the audience in a box before the show.\nBottom line: It’s tragically delicious.\nDetails: Reviewed Friday, Feb. 17.

In one, a pair of actors enact an uncomfortable exchange between strangers by holding thought bubbles over their heads. In another, a young woman playing on a giant faux smartphone is harassed by a pair of creepy puppet eyes admonishing her, “Come on, smile!” At the Camelback Road stop, a couple of skittish bunnies make friends with a dragon that turns out not to be as scary as it seems. The makeshift nature of the venues sometimes makes it hard to see and hear what’s going on, and, as in a lot of children’s theater, the tone might be a bit didactic for the adults who come along for the ride. But there’s so much joy and imagination on display that you’d have to be a real humbug not to crack a smile.\nBottom line: It’s not world-changing art, but sometimes the journey is more important than the destination.\nDetails: Reviewed Sunday, Feb. 19. Continues through Sunday, Feb. 26. On Central Avenue starting at the Roosevelt Street stop.

The latest example is a bit of a curveball: a 15-minute short that Broadway innovator Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote in between his hip-hop hits “In the Heights” and “Hamilton.” He created it for public radio’s “This American Life,” based on the true story of a high-school kid with a crush on a girl who turns out to be an undercover police detective out to bust drug dealers. The actual story is kind of depressing, but the telling is fresh, fun and funny as the young cast sings wry rhymes such as “Everybody’s got a cousin / Who can hook him up with sumpin’.” To make an evening out of it, there’s more entertainment in the lobby between performances, including poetry readings and freestyle rap battles by cast members who, you should be warned, are brand-new to the art form. “8 Mile” it ain’t, but it’s all in good fun.\nBottom line: A 15-minute musical makes more sense on YouTube than as a night out, so this event feels more like a fund-raiser than a full-fledged production.\nDetails: Reviewed Saturday, Feb. 18.
