Hidden Figures went into Sunday night's Oscars up for three awards, including the top prize of best picture, where some suspected the film about African-American women working at NASA could pull off an upset. Well there was a surprise with the best picture winner , but it wasn't that Hidden Figures won. That film just last month won the SAG Awards' equivalent of best picture in best cast, over best picture winner Moonlight and almost-winner La La Land , which wasn't nominated for the ensemble award. Also going home empty-handed after this year's Oscars were Lion , up for six awards; Hell or High Water , nominated for four awards; Jackie , up for three; and two-time nominees Deepwater Horizon, Florence Foster Jenkins, Kubo and the Two Strings, Moana, Passengers and Rogue One . Meanwhile, eight-time nominee Arrival only won one award, for best sound editing, after receiving eight nominations, tied with Moonlight , which won three awards, for the second-most nominations this year. In terms of individual awards, Denzel Washington lost the best actor award number of pundits expected him to win, particularly after Washington nabbed the SAG Award for best actor, which predicted the winner in the equivalent Oscars category for the past 13 years in a row. Casey Affleck instead took that prize. There's also a reason why it didn't seem too shocking when La La Land was initially ( and mistakenly ) announced as the best picture winner â€” many pundits had the film as the likely winner of the Oscars' top prize. It received 14 nominations and the other films that received that many ( All About Eve and Titanic ) also won the top prize and it had previously won top prizes at the Golden Globes, BAFTA, Critic's Choice and Producers Guild Awards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T13:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T08:42:21.278+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
