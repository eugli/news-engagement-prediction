Tonight, scratch-built 4x4s are clawing up paths that would make mountain goats nervous in the Vision X Shootout, which you can watch in real time from the comfort of your computer! What a time to be alive. \nIf the embed here isn’t working, try watching directly on the Ultra4 website .

Enjoy this rock-crawling action tonight, and get stoked for similar insanity right up until the main event on Friday. \nThe event has been growing for years, and they’ve messed around with lives streaming before, but this is the first time I’ve seen live video of this kind of event captured in such glorious clarity! I can’t wait to get out to this dry lakebed on Thursday. And I hope you can join me. But if you can’t, hang out from your house via livestream!
