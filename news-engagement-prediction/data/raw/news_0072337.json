The second would be, and in a throwback to the Assembly election of 2014 and the Kalyan-Dombivali Municipal Corporation election in 2015, to form a post-poll alliance with each other. Create line charts \nIt must be borne in mind that to touch the magic figure of 114 seats (to be the ruling party), even if the BJP or Sena was to tie-up with the MNS (seven seats), NCP (nine seats), ABS (one seat) and four Independents, the party would still fall short of the magic number. The Samajwadi Party's six seats and AIMIM's three seats do not figure in the equation since neither of these parties would ever tie-up with the Sena or BJP. \nAnd so, at present, the second option — a post-poll Sena-BJP alliance — appears more likely.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T13:36:35.533+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
