The Queens musician posted a flick with the Canadian superstar on her Instagram on Wednesday morning (February 1). \nAbout 15 minutes after the first post, Nicki followed up the explosive picture of her and Drake with one of them and Lil Wayne at a studio, taken by Young Money president Mack Maine . A photo posted by Mack Maine (@mackmaine4president) on Feb 1, 2017 at 8:42am PST \nDrake posted both photos to his own account too, although with him being busy on tour in Europe, chances are that these shots weren’t uploaded the same day they were taken. \nObviously this was a big deal because Minaj was posting a pic of herself and her ex-boyfriend Meek Mill’s rap enemy following a messy break-up . The Philly rapper’s years-long feud with Drake reportedly sullied the working relationship between the two Young Money artists but now it appears that all is forgiven. \nThough Meek Mill is currently off IG for now, he was staying busy posting pictures of big booty women and relegating his ex to a ring girl for a theoretical boxing match between him and Drake. \nThe Game even poked fun at the situation by reposting the picture and quoting lyrics from Drake’s Meek Mill diss “Back To Back,” crowning the OVO boss “Twenty 6 SAVAGE.” A photo posted by The Game (@losangelesconfidential) on Feb 1, 2017 at 8:37am PST \nThe picture was also re-posted by Birdman with the caption “#lifestyle.” Clarity on the status of Wayne and Birdman’s relationship and the release of one of this generation’s most highly-anticipated albums, Tha Carter V, remains unclear. While Birdman says fans will hear it, Wayne says otherwise . \nThe Grammy Award-winning superstar has been spotted in the studio quite a few times these past months despite Tha Carter V delays, fights and leaks . In November, he was seen with Grammy Award-winning producer Scott Storch and the following month he was seen making music with Taylor Gang artist Sosamann . \nWeezy F. Baby’s Facebook account hinted January 3 that at least three projects are in the works . \n“CV. Funeral. D6. Young Money,” Lil Wayne captioned along with a picture of himself, 2 Chainz and Gudda Gudda at the club. Although headlines mostly ignored the Young Money part of his Facebook caption, it could be an indication that Wayne is working on a followup to 2009’s We Are Young Money.
