By Sara Boboltz \nAlan Rickman and Emma Thompson’s storyline was perhaps the most heartbreaking of the 2003 ensemble “Love Actually.” When Harry (Rickman) attracts attention from his young secretary ― spoiler! ― his wife and the devoted mother of his children, Karen (Thompson), finds out after realizing a necklace he’d bought wasn’t a gift for her. Instead, she’d received instead a decidedly unsexy Joni Mitchell CD, and their marriage is left strained. \nUnfortunately for fans, the upcoming mini-sequel to the hit film won’t fill us in on what Harry and Karen have been up to. \nAccording to director Richard Curtis, the new script won’t include Thompson or a tribute to Rickman, who died in 2016, per Digital Spy . It’s just too tough. \n“You know, dealing with Alan is very complicated,” Curtis told the Press Association, so a tribute is “not really” part of the plan. He also confirmed the actress won’t be able to participate. Michele Gregolin / Reuters Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson embrace at the Venice Film Festival in 1997. \nThe project, announced last week , will be made in celebration of Red Nose Day, a biennial event that supports the British charity Comic Relief that Curtis co-founded in 1985. Original cast members including Hugh Grant, Keira Knightley, Colin Firth, Bill Nighy, Liam Neeson, Andrew Lincoln, Thomas Brodie-Sangster and Rowan Atkinson are all set to appear ― so at least we’ll find out what happened after that creepy nighttime cue-card scene between Juliet (Knightley) and her husband’s best friend, Mark. (Lincoln, who played Mark, has said his character “ is a stalker .”) \n“It’ll certainly be a nostalgic moment getting back together and recreating their characters 14 years later,” Curtis said in a statement last week. \nIt’s set to air March 24 on BBC One and May 25 on NBC.
