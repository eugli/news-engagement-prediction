Dr Richard House, a psychologist, said: ‘These communication technologies are almost certainly having long-term and possibly dramatic impacts on family life. ‘It is potentially catastrophic for the human relational values that underpin family life at its best, with real, face-to-face communication being increasingly displaced and sidelined by the machine.’ However, it is not always the youngsters of the household who are to blame. Our cartoonist's take on the subject of mobile phones in the household Dipti Shah, family therapist at London Child and Therapy centre, said: ‘Technology makes keeping in touch easier. But sometimes children complain it is their parents who are on the phone too much.’ The study found that a third of us worry that family members have become ‘lazy’ because they spend too much time playing video games. But whilst these findings would fill many of us with horror, eight out of ten still say that technology has had a positive impact on their lives. Those who think technology has improved their lives value activities such as online shopping and the ability to stream TV shows on Netflix and the BBC iPlayer. More than a quarter also valued the peace of mind technology brings, whilst six out of ten say that it has become easier to stay in touch with family and friends. Lindsey Rix, of Aviva, said there was evidence that ‘the “always on” culture is making it difficult for people to switch off, and in some cases is causing people to become stressed’. She added: ‘Households with children in particular suggest that technology can at times be intrusive, with people communicating via their phones rather than in person, and at inappropriate times such as during family meals.’   Most watched News videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T08:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T05:23:07.047+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
