Guess we'll have to watch and find out where all this is going down. \nWatch the video clip, below: \nCan we talk about Miguel's best man speech, though? #BestManGoals, #ToastGoals, and honestly, that montage gives us #MarriageGoals. \nPlease just tell us how Jack died; this is cruel and unusual punishment. PHOTO: NBC \nAs for photos from the set, Mandy Moore (Rebecca Pearson) posted a super cute wedding snap on her Instagram, which shows off the surprisingly chic '70s looks.
