The current H-1B minimum wage of $60,000 was fixed in 1989 and has since remained unchanged.Such protectionist stance by the US could also spell more trouble for IT firms that are already facing strong headwinds from currency fluctuation and cautious client spending.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T13:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T08:43:09.430+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
