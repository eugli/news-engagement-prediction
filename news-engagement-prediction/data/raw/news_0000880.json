The residential brokerage held its 2017 Real Estate Market Outlook conference on Wednesday at the Downtown Miami Hilton. EMW presented a report on the market in Miami-Dade and Broward counties, plus an outlook on the economy and transportation. 4 photos Ron Shuffield, president and CEO of EWM “We have a pretty good indication of what is going to happen in pricing down the road,” Shuffield said. “There will be pressure to reduce asking prices. We have had a lot of success in last six months or so with sellers coming to the realization that they need to reduce prices.” The oversupply is mostly in the high-end market, Shuffield said. Homes priced under $300,000 are still moving quickly in both counties, although there’s a limited supply of them for sale. Miami-Dade has the largest supply of $1 million-plus condos on the market in its history at 2,549 as of Dec. 31. The previous year-end high was 1,849 in 2006 — as the last real estate boom was peaking before the recession. Inventory surged 75 percent over the past two years, including 19 percent in 2016 alone. Sales plummeted 22 percent. As a result, inventory in the $1 million-plus condo market represented 55 months of supply at the current sales pace. Many of the new condo developments in Miami-Dade have focused on the high-end market, as builders keep pushing the envelope on price per square foot in areas like Brickell, Miami Beach, Edgewater and Sunny Isles Beach. The new luxury construction will further increase inventory levels and put negative pricing pressure on neighborhoods such as Brickell, which already has a 36-month supply, Shuffield said. Prices have already started to come down in some buildings, but there probably won’t be widespread major discounts because most of the buyers don’t have mortgages. Since fewer buyers will be compelled by lenders to sell on the cheap, it could take longer to eat through this condo inventory than the aftermath of the last recession, Shuffield said. The report said the most compelling factor for the luxury sales decline was the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar that reduced the buying power for people from countries such as Brazil, Argentina, Russia and Venezuela. It’s expected that the U.S. dollar will remain strong in 2017, the report said. Once Brazil and the global economy recovers, that should greatly benefit South Florida real estate, especially in Miami-Dade, said J. Antonio Villamil , principal of the Washington Economics Group . He expects Brazil’s economy to pick up in late 2017 and 2018, but BREXIT could bog down Europe this year. The good news is continued growth in the U.S. economy and domestic migration to Florida should bring more buyers, Villamil said. Payroll growth in South Florida has been especially impressive, especially in Broward. However, homebuyers who depend on a mortgage could have less buying power. Villamil said interest rates are expected to increase 75 to 100 basis points by the end of 2017. Shuffield said that would cause more price decreases, as every 100 basis point increase reduces the mortgage amount a buyer could obtain for the same monthly payment by 11 percent. More $1 million-plus single-family homes have also hit the market in Miami-Dade, with a 55 percent increase over the past two years. Yet, sales fell 10 percent in 2016. The supply in the luxury market was 26 months, giving buyers plenty of choices. Villamil said the business deregulation and taxation policies of President Donald J. Trump should be very positive for the U.S. economy and could lead to accelerated growth in 2018. Yet, he’s concerned that Trump’s proposed trade policies, especially imposing big tariffs on Mexico, and restrictions on H-1B visas for workers could negatively impact the economy. “The fundamentals for South Florida are positive going forward,” Villamil said. In the overall Miami-Dade home market, inventory was up 14 percent in 2016 and sales declined 11 percent. That means it shifted more thanks a buyer’s market. The supply was six months for single-family homes and 14 months for condos. Supply was much tighter for properties under $1 million than for luxury properties. By comparison, the Broward market was more stable. Housing inventory declined 3 percent in 2016 while sales inched down 1 percent. However, sales had been increasing in recent years. Prices leveled off following several years of increases. Supply was fairly balanced, at four months for single-family homes and six months for condos. The inventory of $1 million-plus condos in Broward jumped 23 percent in 2016 yet sales dropped 28 percent. The supply of 29 months was a buyer’s market, but not as dramatically as in Miami-Dade. Broward had one-sixth the number of luxury condo listings as Miami-Dade, so its prices were lower. Few new condo projects in Broward have exceeded the $1 million average asking price. For $1 million-plus single-family homes in Broward, inventory increased 13 percent as sales fell 7 percent. The supply was 22 months, a bit less than in Miami-Dade. Median prices for $1 million-plus properties declined in both counties. Alice N. Bravo , director of transportation and public works for Miami-Dade County, encouraged developers to pursue affordable homes along public transit corridors, both existing and future. Under the SMART Plan, the county has identified six new public transit routes it plans to build and they need increased density along those corridors to increase ridership, she said. Indeed, the EWM report showed demand was robust at lower prices. Single-family homes priced below $300,000 represented 48 percent of sales in Miami-Dade and 45 percent in Broward. The supply of inventory for both counties was 2 months, so prices have increased. The inventory of condos below $300,000 was seven months in Miami-Dade and five months in Broward. The EWM report also broke down the sales by submarket. In single-family homes, sales increased strongly in Homestead, Hialeah Gardens, North Miami, North Miami Beach, Northeast Broward, Plantation and southwest Fort Lauderdale. Sales fell especially sharply in Miami Beach, Biscayne Park, Bal Harbour, Florida City, Key Biscayne, Miami Shores and Surfside. For condo sales, there were sharp declines in Miami, Miami Beach, Miami Lakes, Aventura, Bal Harbour, Bay Harbor Islands, North Bay Village, Sunny Isles Beach, Surfside, Doral, Hialeah Gardens, Key Biscayne, Northeast Fort Lauderdale, Southeast Fort Lauderdale and East Hollywood. Condo sales increased in relatively few submarkets where prices were generally less expensive, including North Miami, Opa-Locka, Sweetwater, and Northwest Hollywood. Markets with the highest months of supply for single-family homes were Golden Beach (54), Key Biscayne (36) North Broward/North Lauderdale (36), Sunny Isles Beach (26), Doral (24), Miami Beach (24), Central Hollywood (24), Tamarac/Sunrise/Lauderhill (24), North Broward U.S. 1 to Dixie Highway (20), Aventura (18), and Davie (18). On the other hand, cities with relatively low supply included Weston (2), Miami Gardens (2), Hialeah (3), Homestead (3), and Northwest and Southwest Hollywood (3). For the condo market, many of the coastal and urban areas in Miami-Dade have buyer’s markets for inventory. The submarkets with the highest months supply of inventory were Sunny Isles Beach (28), Surfside (24), Miami (20), Bay Harbor Islands (20), Bal Harbor (20), Aventura (19), Key Biscayne (19), and North Bay Village (17). Supply was relatively tight in the less expensive markets of Hialeah (3) and Northwest and Southwest Hollywood (3). Brian Bandell covers real estate, foreclosures and health care.
