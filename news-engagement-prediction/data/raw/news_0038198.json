Grant Hackett is not the first high-profile sportsperson to struggle to adjust to life in retirement. \nHackett admitted then he had become reliant on sleeping pills. \nEarly last year, he was forced to apologise for clashing with a passenger on a domestic flight, notoriously known as the nipple-tweaking episode. \nThe Olympian denied suggestions he had struggled without the structure of elite swimming. \nBut Craig Hackett said it was clear to the family his brother needed help. \n\"Nobody can do it â€” we can't do it. We're pleading for people to help us, we really are,\" he said. \n\"This is now a chronic problem and it looks like it's not really going to go away in a hurry so from a mental health perspective I hope something can be done, I really do.\" \nCraig said he and his parents had tried for years to help, but had not gotten to the bottom of what was troubling him. \n\"We've got to get an actual medical diagnosis, until that happens we're just guessing,\" he said. \n\"But we all know, the community knows, everybody knows that there's something that needs to be done. \n\"It's coming to the point now where he's dangerous. At times he is dangerous. Photo: Grant's father Nev Hackett said he would support his son through his recovery. (AAP: Ed Jackson) \n\"He's a danger to himself, he's a danger to the community and poor Mum and Dad have tried to look after him so much I'm concerned for their welfare. \n\"If there's anybody out there at all who can help him, you know we're all for it. But I think we've reached the end of the road at this point.\" End of career help needed for athletes \nOlympic swimmer Julie McDonald said the sports world was becoming more aware it needs to support stars like Hackett after their careers end. \nMcDonald said high achievers could experience extreme lows when they are no longer involved in elite competition. \n\"There is a lot more information out there now, obviously a lot of people are starting to learn, but at the end of the day the athlete has to admit they have got a problem.\" \nNev Hackett said his son would now receive help from the best doctors they could find. \n\"We've got a long road ahead of us, Grant's got a long road ahead, but we'll support him the whole way,\" he said. \n\"It is alcohol and I suspect, perhaps from time to time, there could be prescription drugs, but I wouldn't know that for sure. \n\"We'll do anything to help him, anything at all. But it's hard for people with this sort of problem, not just Grant but across the board. \n\"I was a police officer for 40 years and I've seen this sort of thing but it's entirely different when it happens at home.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T03:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T03:37:02.824+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
