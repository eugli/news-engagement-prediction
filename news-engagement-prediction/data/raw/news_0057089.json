Murphy said she couldn’t stand the “favoritism” that Eye has received in the UFC. “I don’t have anything personal against Jessica Eye, it’s just what the f*ck — if you’re on a four-fight losing streak, how the f*ck do you still have a UFC contract?” Murphy said in the video.” And how the f*ck are you still in the rankings? Four. Fight. Losing. Streak. Did you see the list of guys they cut last week? Some of them were on a one-fight losing streak. “F*ck man. It’s just not fair. It’s crazy how unfair it is.” On Tuesday, Eye responded to Murphy on Twitter, and the two had a back and forth. That actually reall funny cause I am told the bitch is cut from the ufc so I don't why she keeps flapping her mouth https://t.co/UVapvACGak — Jessica Eye (@jessicaevileye) February 21, 2017 Lol you lying again, Jess. Im not cut. Ive been tellin the truth since day one- u dont deserve to be in the UFC on a 4 fight losing streak. https://t.co/V6nwJwxNnZ — Lauren Murphy (@LaurenMurphyMMA) February 21, 2017 @LaurenMurphyMMA do yourself a favor & quit trying to talk yourself into a fight that you're fighting ability will never be able to get you. — Jessica Eye (@jessicaevileye) February 21, 2017 you're right...I should have aimed higher than picking a fight with someone who lost their last 5 out of 6. I'm setting the bar too low... https://t.co/BvwXPla9gb — Lauren Murphy (@LaurenMurphyMMA) February 22, 2017 The 33-year old Murphy is coming off of a loss (unanimous decision) against Katlyn Chookagian at UFC Fight Night 91 in July. Before then she had defeated Kelly Faszholz via third-round TKO. The former Invicta FC bantamweight champion has gone 1-3 in the UFC, with a narrow split-decision loss against Sara McMann and a loss against Liz Carmouche in April 2015. Eye has lost four straight, and five out of six. She last competed at UFC 203 in her native Cleveland, where she dropped a split decision against Bethe Correira. Her lone victory in the UFC came against Leslie Smith at UFC 180 (TKO, doctor stoppage) in 2014.
