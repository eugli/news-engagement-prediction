(Courtesy of Carolyn Rizza) \nTwo fire departments in Hunterdon County are using social media to recruit volunteers and spread their message of staying safe. \nClinton Township's Annandale Hose Compnay posted a video on its Facebook page this month in which members talk about the rewards of helping their neighbors and urge others to join the cause. It has already garnered more than 10,000 visits. \nIn East Amwell Township, Carolyn Rizza, a 20-year old volunteer firefighter and first responder in the Amwell Valley Fire Co., created a public service announcement about the dangers of texting and driving. \nThe YouTube video, posted on the department's Facebook page and website, is part of Rizza's application for a college scholarship. \nIn the two-minute Annandale video, firefighter Brandon Bundt, a four-year member of the department, explains, \"I wanted to make a difference in the community. We can go out on people's worst days and try to make it better. That's a feeling you can't recreate anywhere else.\" \nThe video shows the firefighters and trucks in action at the scene of fires. \nAnnandale Fire Chief Robert Emery said Tuesday the video, posted on Feb. 2, has drawn \"an overwhelming response as far as Facebook hits go.\" \nBut, \"As far as I know, there have been no applications for volunteers\" as a result of the video, Emery said. \nHowever, the fire department isn't done with the online effort, Emery said. It plans to post two more videos, one at the end of May and the other in the fall. \n\"Obviously, we're in need of volunteers. You can't just sit and do nothing. At some point, you have to take a chance. People don't know who we are,\" Emery said. \nClinton Township comprises 34 square miles and the Annandale Hose Co. serves that entire area, which is also served by eight post offices. Some people \"don't know where they live,\" Emery said. \nThe department has 46 volunteers on its roster, but only 25 are active and many are unavailable for duty during the day, he said. \n\"I'd be happy if we could get six more guys,\" he said, noting that two recruits completed the training this year. \nAs far as the video is concerned, Emery said, the department got the idea from the Clinton First Aid and Rescue Squad which also posted a video. \nRizza made her three-minute video with help from her firefighter father, James Rizza, her two brothers who are emergency medical technicians and others who serve in the fire company and the Amwell Valley Ambulance Corps. \nTitled \"Don't Text & Drive,\" it opens with two young women walking with their cell phones, gossiping and laughing, while a man of about 50 shakes his head and mutters, \"Kids\" while getting into his truck. \nLater, however, the man is seen texting while driving. The screen shows statistics reporting that those who text while driving are 23 times more likely to be involved in a crash. \nAmwell Valley emergency responders rush to the scene after hearing the dispatcher's message: \"Overturned motor vehicle, on fire with an entrapment.\" The man is determined dead after he is placed in the ambulance. \nRizza says, \"As a young driver and a first responder, I would like to remind you that accidents have no age. Stay alive and don't text and drive.\" \nRizza said she came up with the concept for the video in consultation with her father. She said she wanted to make the point that not all texting accidents are caused by young drivers. \n\"Just driving around the street you see a lot of adults texting and driving,\" she said. \"People are always fidgeting with their phones.\" \nLooking at the video, \"You think the girls will be involved in the accident, but actually it's a 50-year-old man,\" she pointed out. \nRizza decided to make the video as part of a competition for a college scholarship. She will be graduating from Raritan Valley Community College this spring and entering the more expensive The College of New Jersey in the fall. \nAfter entering TCNJ, Rizza plans to continue living at home and volunteering as a firefighter. \"I like to do things to give back to the community,\" she said. \nRizza added that many of her friends \"went away to college and joined sororities and fraternities,\" but the fire department \"gives me my own set of friends.\" \nBen Horowitz may be reached at .
