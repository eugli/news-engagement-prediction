The case for continuity at Arsenal is diminishing by the day under Arsene Wenger \nAnd 1971 Double-winner Wilson, a staunch Wenger supporter who worked as the Frenchman's goalkeeping coach until his retirement in 2002, is now among those wondering whether his old boss' reign is coming to an end. \n\"He's such an intelligent man and he can only take so much,\" Wilson said. \"He cares for the club, he lives his life for the football club and has done for two decades now. \n\"I am asking myself this morning: 'will the manner in which there was a collapse at the end of that game tip him over the edge because he doesn't have a contract beyond this season? The Arsenal manager says the loss of Laurent Koscielny to injury cost his team dear in Munich, as the Gunners went down 5-1 to Bayern \n\"Do the club need to take him out of the firing line? He's such an honourable man he's never going to walk away from the club - you won't find that - so there are big decisions to be made.\" \nAsked if he would advise Wenger to leave, he said: \"I wouldn't do that. You're talking about such an amazing guy, someone with an incredible brain who changed the face of the game in England from the time he arrived. \n\"You're talking about a guy who is very capable of coming up with the right decision.\" \nThe Bayern result was Arsenal's second 5-1 defeat at the Allianz Arena in as many seasons, and Wilson acknowledged a \"fragility\" and lack of leadership in the current side. \nBut he said: \"It's the players' fault. If you're a professional footballer from the day you sign your contract you should have within you three letters - W-I-N. Win. Alexis Sanchez scored Arsenal's goal in the Allianz Arena \n\"Okay, the manager plays a part as regards the tactical side of it, but if you're playing for Arsenal Football Club you're playing for the badge, the fans, the club, yourself and your family. \n\"Everyone's going to turn round and say it's the manager's fault. I don't go with that at all.\" Also See: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T19:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T14:23:57.522+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
