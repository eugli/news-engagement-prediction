(HT File Photo) \nThe family of seven-year-old Ghazal Yadav, who died in the school hours of DPS World School in Noida Extension , has approached National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) to intervene and find out the events that led to the girl’s death. \nGhazal’s parents said that there was a delay in the investigation by the police, due to which they decided to approach NCPCR. They said that the truth will be revealed only after an investigation is ordered by a judicial magistrate. \n“Since January 31, I am running from pillar to post to seek justice for my daughter. I want to know the sequence of events that led to her death. The school management’s version is suspicious. Statements have been changed several times by the school,” Lal Chand Yadav, Ghazal’s father, said.

Since then, her family has been demanding the sequence of events that led to her death. \nFollowing an uproar by Ghazal’s parents, a case of negligence was registered against the school at the Ecotech-3 police station in Greater Noida. However, Ghazal’s parents allege that no strict action has been taken. \n“I was told Ghazal started bleeding profusely from the nose when she was being taken to the hospital. A teacher informed me that she had tried to call me but the management had stopped her. The truth will emerge only after a thorough probe,” Lal Chand said. \nGhazal’s mother, Savita, in a letter to the chairman of NCPCR mentioned that many school children told her that Ghazal had complained of a severe headache to her teachers, but no attention was paid to her. \n“We are holding the school responsible because they have made different statements. Moreover, young children cannot manipulate the truth. Her classmates and other children had seen her complain to teachers and also saw her bleeding from the nose. We don’t have evidence and we are not authorities. A fair investigation will bring out the truth,” Savita said. \nGhazal’s parents had started a Facebook campaign to garner the support of parents and residents. The parents are also hopeful that the district magistrate will take cognizance of the issue. \nDPS World School, in a statement to the media, mentioned that the CCTV footage of all events on January 31 has been handed over to the police and the management is cooperating with the police for the investigation. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T18:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:33:55.381+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
