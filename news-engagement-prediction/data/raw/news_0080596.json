We were just 12 and I remember everyone telling William he played the game of his life. But his dad bent down and said, \"Don't believe anything they say, you were shit today.\" William didn't play much after that. \nSocceroos coach Ange Postecoglou is one of the high-profile people to share a story of how sideline issues affected them as children. \n\"We must have been 10 or 11 and the parents started arguing and fighting amongst each other,\" he says in a video to be rolled out with the campaign. \n\"Both teams just huddled together in the centre circle, each of us frightened. \n\"The people arguing and fighting outside the field forgot why they were there, because why they were there was their kids, and their kids were scared and huddled together.\" External Link: Ange Postecoglou on the Let Kids Be Kids campaign \nPostecoglou is joined by a number of identities from across the sporting world, including cricketers Usman Khawaja and Ellyse Perry, AFL footballer Nick dal Santo, rugby league player Sam Thaiday, and netballer Caitlin Thwaites. \nIt builds on similar initiatives in the US and UK that attempt to stop not just abuse, but also derogatory or overly critical comments that detract from children's fun. \nIt comes just two months after the ASC's inaugural AusPlay report found participation in junior sports starts to decline rapidly when kids reach 11 years old . \nThwaites said poor sideline behaviour could be a contributing factor. \n\"If it is not enjoyable and they are feeling that pressure I think at that young age for kids it just translates into not enjoying it and not having fun,\" she told ABC News Breakfast. External Link: Kids share their stories for the Let Kids Be Kids campaign \nThwaites said this did not just mean parents yelling at players, but also trying to be overly instructional and focusing too much on winning. \n\"I think that is definitely one that is a bit more common rather than seeing full-blown fights on the sidelines,\" she said. \n\"It just adds to that pressure of the kids not wanting to make a mistake â€¦ I think kids are going to learn those things anyway. \n\"It doesn't need to be forced on you or the kid being hounded at, that they have had a loss or a win.\" \nThe campaign material will be officially launched today on the Play By The Rules website , which provides information, tools and free online training courses for volunteers involved in junior sport.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T03:16:18.950+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
