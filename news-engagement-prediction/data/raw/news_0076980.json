Not ever. \nDay 16: Take The Day Off \nSit on the couch. Play Xbox. Eat junk food if you want to. Let your mind switch off. Do the lazy stuff that you want to do every other day. Let it all out. Why? Because you have to give yourself room to be imperfect. You have to give yourself room to be a mess. It’s natural. \nDay 17: Write An Emergency Plan \nWhat’s your biggest fear? For me, it’s suffering a permanent injury that would stop me from working. In order to counteract that fear, I’ve spent time developing checklists and processes for what would happen in an emergency like that. What would happen if I had to go to Hospital. I keep these checklists on my laptop, and I’ve given instructions to the people who know me best about how to access those lists. \nSounds over the top, right? It gives me a sense of security and preparedness that makes me feel ready to take on risks. Any risks at all. \nDay 18: Face The Facts…The People Who Hate You Aren’t Worth Your Time. \nGuess what. Some people are always going to think you’re an asshole. That’s just the way it goes.– Doesn’t matter what you do.– Doesn’t matter how you do it.– Someone will always hate you. \nPeople find reasons and ways (and somehow time) to hate Mother Teresa. People will find the energy to hate you too. \nSo you have to accept that those people are not fucking worth your time. Who cares about them. You shouldn’t, for starters. \nDay 19: Cut Out The Junk Food (but not completely) \nOne of the best decisions I ever made was to start reducing the amount of junk food I consumed on a daily basis. Way back when I used to live next door to a McDonalds’ I’d eat there every day. I’d eat there every chance I got. I’d eat there like I was a damn shareholder. \nAnd it got to me. It affected my moods. It affected everything about me. It affected my weight (of course) but it also stopped me sleeping. It drove my depression right up. It stopped me from being productive. \nNOTE…one of the worst things I ever did was quit eating junk food completely . Because my body craved it. And I was always, always denying it, and that craving didn’t go away and eventually I snapped and swung too far back the other way and ate so much crap I felt terrible for days. Don’t get extreme. Give yourself room to be imperfect. That should be my motto, I say it enough times. \nDay 20: Change Your Surroundings \nI think it’s always important to be vigilant of what you’re doing and aware of your surroundings. — Leona Lewis \nThe rooms you live and work in have a massive impact on your moods, your health and your productivity. A massive impact. My business almost failed when I had a messy office with trash everywhere and an old milk crate stool. My business picked up when I splashed out on a proper desk, a proper chair and a Batman print for my damn wall. \nStart thinking about the way your surroundings are impacting your life and who you are as a person, and if there are negatives — look at making small changes. Adding a picture to your desk. Lighting a candle. Doesn’t matter, as long as it shakes it all up. …The Next 40 Days \nDay 21: Start Doing Volunteer Work \nDay 22.

Wait, Though. I’ve Read This Post, Why Should I Listen To Any of It? \nBecause I’ve followed this 60 day checklist myself. \nI created it — day by day — during the worst periods of my diagnosed depression when I was swinging between taking medication and just not even getting out of bed. When I was drinking. A lot. When I was broke. When I had nothing. When I hated myself. \nI’m a different person now, and I’ve worked hard to become that. Honestly, this process has made an incredible difference. And if you follow it, what have you got to lose? I’m not charging you for it. It’s just my idea of how you can improve yourself. \n[This post by Jon Westenberg first appeared on Medium and has been reproduced with permission.] Note from Inc42: The views and opinions expressed are solely those of the author and does not necessarily reflect the views held by Inc42, its creators or employees.
