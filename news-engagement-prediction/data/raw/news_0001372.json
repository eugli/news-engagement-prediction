External Link: Riders in the 1928 Tour de France \nFast forward to present day and two mates have attempted to cycle that same route — on the same metal bikes — to honour a unique Australian-New Zealand foursome that made history in the race 89 years ago. \n\"I've always had a fascination with stories about underdogs,\" said one of the cyclists, Phil Keoghan, who is perhaps best known as the host of The Amazing Race. \n\"I found this great book about the history of cycling in New Zealand and they wrote about a guy called Harry Watson who was from my hometown of Christchurch. \n\"I started reading and realised he was the first New Zealander to ride in the Tour de France and a member of the first English-speaking team to ride in the Tour.\" \nWatson was joined by three Australians — Sir Hubert Opperman, Ernie Bainbridge and Percy Osborne — who together made the six-week trip by sea to Europe for their historic ride.

After that he and Mr Cornell set about tracing the original route by car to see if it was actually possible to follow it. Photo: Retracing the steps of the 1928 race.

Still, they found a way through. \nThey averaged 240 kilometres a day for 26 days, cycling the circuit around the edges of France and across both the Pyrenees and Alps mountain ranges. \nThey confronted their own challenges — not least the \"death stage\" that took them 23.5 hours to complete. \n\"The feeling of satisfaction now, with all the reflection, is not just going over those legendary climbs in the middle of the night, but knowing that these humble men who lived in a time where you didn't skite, you didn't show off about your achievements, that their achievements will not be forgotten now,\" Mr Keoghan said. \n\"They should be celebrated.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T10:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T07:28:45.540+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
