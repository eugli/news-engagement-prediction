Reuters Adele won five awards in total at the GRAMMYs including Album of the Year, Song of the Year and Record of the Year \n\nIn her acceptance speech for Album of the Year – awarded for ‘25’ – however, the Hello singer shocked fans when she announced she didn’t deserve it . \nShe said: ““The ‘Lemonade’ album is monumental, so monumental, so well-thought-out, so beautiful and soul-baring.” \nIt turns out she may not be the only one who feels that way. \nWhile Adele fans are delighted with the wins, Beyoncé’s legions of avid supporters are furious that their idol was snubbed for the coveted award . 2 A pregannt Beyonce performed at the awards ceremony last night \nOne outraged tweeter said: “How can Beyoncé only win 1 award at the grammys and Adele beat her for Album of the year? Woman had over 9 nominations & better album.” \nAnother twitter user weigh up the argument: “Beyonce album was better but you can’t ignore the fact that Adele album sold more in 1 week than Beyonces sold in the whole year.” How can Beyoncé only win 1 award at the grammys and Adele beat her for Album of the year?
