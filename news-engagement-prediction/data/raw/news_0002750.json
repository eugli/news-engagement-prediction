Article continues below ￼“He will play Sunday and if he plays magnificent, he will play against Hull City in the next match. It’s simple,” Mourinho said.\nWhile Martial didn’t score during the 4-0 demolition of Wigan, he had a very good game - demonstrated by his brilliant assist for Henrik Mkhitaryan’s goal. Article continues below ￼Surely he deserved a start against Hull on Wednesday.\nWell, not according to Mourinho who started Martial on the bench for the visit of Marco Silva’s side. Not only that, but he failed to bring him on during the 0-0 draw, bringing on both Juan Mata and Wayne Rooney instead. \nIt was a decision that angered United fans as they believed Martial’s directness and pace would have brought the goal they desperately needed. How Martial reacted \nWhile we know how the supporters reacted, we also know how Martial himself reacted to being an unused substitute. \nThat’s because a report in the Telegraph has detailed how Martial felt after Mourinho’s latest snub. They state that he believed he had done enough against Wigan to keep his place and was left “bitterly disappointed” by Mourinho’s decision. \nDuring the game, many people noticed that Martial failed to warm-up on the touchline - something that United have denied there was anything untoward going on. \n￼But Martial was “deeply frustrated” to be left out of the starting XI and must be wondering what he needs to do to play regular football at Old Trafford this season. \nAt least Martial will be aware that Mourinho will need him this season. With the Red Devils still in the FA Cup, in the EFL Cup final and in the knockout stages of the Europa League - not to mention fighting for a place in the top four - Mourinho will require every member of his squad for the remainder of the campaign. \nMartial will just be hoping he’s named in the starting line-up more often, rather coming on as a sub - or not even coming on at all. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
