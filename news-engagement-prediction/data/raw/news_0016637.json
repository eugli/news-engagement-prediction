Article continues below \n\"In my conversations with him in January, it became clear that Alastair felt a huge amount of energy, drive and determination was needed to drive the team forward over the next 12 months,\" England's director of cricket told the BBC. \n\"You are the only one who knows how much gas you have left in the tank and how much the many demands of being England captain are taking out of you.
