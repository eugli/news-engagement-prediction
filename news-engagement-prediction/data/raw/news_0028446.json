Advertisement \nFederal Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce urged WA Premier Colin Barnett to reconsider. \n\"He should seriously consider whether he thinks that this is a good idea or whether he's flirting with a concept that would put his own side and Liberal colleagues in opposition,\" he said. \nBut the Liberal party has shifted its view on One Nation since John Howard's decree that the party be put last on any ballot paper, nearly 20 years ago. Mr Howard has been contacted for comment. \nThe Queensland LNP, which does not have the same problem as its WA colleagues, having formally merged its Liberal and National parties in 2008, is likely to preference One Nation in some seats, as it seeks to unseat the minority Labor government. \nThat move has the support of federal colleagues, including George Christensen, who said he would like to see One Nation preferenced ahead of Labor. \nThe most recent News Corp poll found One Nation is on track to win one-in-four votes at the upcoming Queensland election, expected to be held later this year, and is likely to do better than the 11 seats it won at the peak of its popularity in the 1998 state election. \nFormer prime minister Tony Abbott, who was a key player in the defeat of One Nation in the late 1990s, early 200s, said he believed Senator Hanson was a \"different…[and] better person today than she was 20 years ago\" and recommended placing One Nation ahead of Labor on the ballot. \nIndustry Minister Arthur Sinodinos described the second coming of One Nation as more \"sophisticated\" on Sunday . \nThe following day, Trade Minister Steve Ciobo echoed the praise. \n\"If you look at, for example, how Pauline Hanson's gone about putting her support in the Senate, you'll see that she's often voting in favour of government legislation,\" he said. \n\"There's a certain amount of economic rationalism, a certain amount of approach that's reflective of what it is we are trying to do to govern Australia in a fiscally responsible way. One Nation has certainly signed up to that much more than Labor.\" \nBut Labor has maintained its opposition to the party, both at a federal and state level. \n\"To have senior ministers on the television and on radio describing these views as sophisticated is quite frankly shocking and they should take a good look at themselves and stop this 24-hour parameter that defines the Turnbull Government. Just take a step back and look at the national interest,\" shadow infrastructure minister Anthony Albanese said. \n\"Australia's national economic interest is not served by xenophobia. \n\"We are in a region whereby we have to engage with the economies of our region and with the people in our region and we have to engage on the basis of respect.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T11:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T06:45:09.559+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
