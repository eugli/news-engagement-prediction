So 1,000 refugees — with migration down and a higher vacancy rate — shouldn't be a big deal for the city, he added.\nAgencies and front-line workers agree that Calgary can accommodate more newcomers if the resources and funding are in place.\n\"Even when we were receiving large numbers, we were able to manage,\" said Anoush Newman, a refugee resettlement co-ordinator at the Calgary Catholic Immigration Society.\n\"But it's not a matter of just taking refugees. It's about what services we have in place, because if we don't have the resources, it's going to be difficult for both the front-line workers and the new Canadians.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T06:52:57.299+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
