The company gradually expanded, opening other stores in the Midwest. In the 1970s, the company changed its name from Zondervan to Family Bookstores, and continued to add locations. \nIn 2012, Georgia business executives bought the company from a private equity firm, which wanted out of years of losses, and the company transitioned from a for-profit enterprise to a nonprofit organization that gave away Bibles and gospel tracts around the world and made donations to groups that care for orphans and widows. \nBut, three years later — citing competition from online merchants — the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. \nAt the time, the company said its sales had fallen 29% from 2008 to about $216 million. \nLast year, Christianity Today reported that Send the Light Distribution, the largest distributor of Christian products, had announced plans to wind down operations because of online competition and Family Christian's bankruptcy, which was a big customer.
