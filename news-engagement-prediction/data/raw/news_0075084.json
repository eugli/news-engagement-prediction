I have watched 4 times in a row and I want to watch it again! All the trolls make me smile! Trolls (2016)...not a good movie by Miguel the Stone Jaguar Slayer Imagine \"A Troll In Central Park\". Now take that film and put it in a nightclub surrounded by blacklight. That's exactly what you get with Trolls. The biggest issue with the film is the complete lack of focus on the writing or character development. Not to mention that the message of happiness, and the tone feel very forced in there somehow, and the writing is just a huge mess. Even when the characters too are just a bunch of sellouts, meaning, instead of having any sort of personality, hey only appear to only sell merchandising. But, if there's anything that works about the film is actually the animation is creative, colorful and the designs and textures are well done. Although the animation is not enough to make the film passable. And it only resulted into DreamWorks' version of The Smurfs. Like how Home is DreamWorks' equivalent to Disney's Lilo and Stitch. Not saying that Home is bad or Lilo and Stitch is bad, I just had to give a good example of some comparisons. IT WAS AWESOME!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T04:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:19:11.655+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
