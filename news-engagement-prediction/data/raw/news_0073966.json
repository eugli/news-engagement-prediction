Drivers diverted to the Patullo and Alex Fraser bridges to avoid paying the Port Mann toll, causing revenue projections for the bridge to be sharply scaled back.\nThe Transportation Investment Corporation says the Port Mann is now expected to turn a profit 10 to 15 years from now.\n\"At first when we introduced tolls people tried out the alternate routes. This region is unique because there are a number of un-tolled alternate routes,\" said spokesperson Greg Johnson. \"But we're seeing people come back now.\"\nAn artist's rendering of the proposed $3.5B toll bridge to replace the George Massey Tunnel.
