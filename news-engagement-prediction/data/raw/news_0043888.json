The film, which will be released on Netflix, is based on author and human rights activist Loung Ung’s book of the same name recounting her suffering under the horrific regime of Khmer Rouge. \n“This country means a great deal to me. This country has been through so much,” Jolie said. “Forty years ago this war affected every single individual here, and I wanted to understand [it] myself. I don’t know much of my son’s [Maddox] birth parents, but I believe they would’ve gone through this war. I wanted to understand him and his culture in a deeper way, and I wanted to bring this story to this country in this country’s language, and I wanted to tell the story of Luong Ung, who’s a dear friend of mine.” \nJolie, who is also special envoy for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, further addressed an op-ed article she wrote for The New York Times about refugee policy. “To use fear tactics and summarize groups of people based on their backgrounds based on their religion and to accuse them all of being people we should be afraid of is policy based on fear and is not nearly close to the reality of what is happening and who these people are,” she said. \nWatch Jolie in the video above.
