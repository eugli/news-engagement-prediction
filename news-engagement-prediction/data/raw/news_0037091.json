In November 2015 Carolyn, who was an IT consultant before Florence was diagnosed, took her to A&E with a 'rock hard' stomach. A few weeks later she was diagnosed with stage 4 neuroblastoma aged just 16 months old, and a scan revealed a 11cm by 9cm tumour on her left adrenal gland. She had 12 rounds of chemo and it dramatically shrunk before an operation in March 2016 removed 80 per cent of the mass. Remarkably an online funding campaign set up by the Florence's parents managed to raise £255,091 in just 11 days from 8,501 donations, including one anonymous payment of £45,000 More than 8,400 friends, family and complete strangers donated in a bid to help the tot But the rest was left behind and she had five weeks of radiotherapy and months of high dose chemo before she was allowed to go home with Carolyn, 47, Rodney, an estate agent, and sister Charlotte, five. But a scan in November revealed the tumour had grown again and last month the family were told it had spread into her stomach, was wrapped around her blood vessels, and was too dangerous to remove. The family claimed world-class Dr Michael. P. La Quaglia in New York was able to operate in similar situations in the past and started fundraising. More than 8,400 friends, family and strangers donated in a bid to help the tot. Commenting on their generosity, Rodney said last month: 'It's humbling to see how many want to help, it has taken our minds off what's going on to a certain extent. 'It has been a huge help. So many friends, family and complete strangers are rallying around to help us and help little Flo out, it is amazing. 'Despite everything, Flo is still fighting on. 'We just want to say thank you to everyone that has helped. It is just amazing what everyone is doing for us.'
