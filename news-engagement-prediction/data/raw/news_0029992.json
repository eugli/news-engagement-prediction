Trump had been “reviewing and evaluating this issue on a daily basis trying to ascertain the truth,” explained Spicer, noting that Trump's first priority was to determine whether Flynn had broken any laws before deciding whether he could still trust him in the job.\nSpeaking to reporters, Feb. 14, White House press secretary discussed the events leading up to the resignation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn from the Trump administration. Here are some key moments from that briefing. (Reuters) There's an incongruity there, however. Trump has sold himself to the public as the decider, the guy willing to make the tough calls in short order — just the opposite of the lily-livered, namby-pambiness that has infected Washington politicians. That image doesn't square with the fact that Trump has known for weeks that his national security adviser wasn't telling the truth concerning what he had talked about with the Russians during the transition period.\nPresented with that sort of information about a contestant on “The Apprentice,” Trump would have brooked no discussion — he would have simply fired the person on the spot. He didn't do that as president. Why?\nOne clue comes to us from this Politico story about the process that led to Flynn's ouster:\nOne person who frequently speaks to Trump said the president was reluctant to ditch Flynn because he doesn't “like to fire people who are loyal.” Even Monday evening, Trump was still pondering the decision, the person said.\n“He has this reputation of being a 'you're fired' kind of guy, but he really didn't want to have that conversation,” the person said.\nThat quote is amazing, right? Trump, who has literally built his brand on being confrontational and firing people, didn't want to fire Flynn. That's a big change from this :\n\nThat Trump took his time in making up his mind about Flynn is not necessarily a bad thing. Personnel issues are often complicated and a look-before-you-leap approach is often necessary. But Trump — and Spicer — don't get to have their cake and eat it, too. If Trump is the decider in chief, it simply doesn't square with the fact that he took several weeks to make up his mind about Flynn, despite evidence that showed that the former security chief misled about his conversations with Russia. If Trump did take his time to gather information, talk to people and then arrive at a decision, then he isn't the most unbelievably decisive person the world has ever known.\nIt's one or the other. It can't be both.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:13:56.542+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
