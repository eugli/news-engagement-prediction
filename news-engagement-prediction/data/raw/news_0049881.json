(PTI) \nFollowing the controversial vote of confidence in the Tamil Nadu assembly, the DMK moved to the Madras high Court against E Palaniswami. The Madras High Court is to hear the petition against the Chief Minister on Tuesday. Meanwhile, it was also reported that O Panneerselvam, who had controversially resigned from his post as Tamil Nadu Chief Minister, is also to go to the High Court against the Chief Minister. After a much heated special Assembly session in Tamil Nadu today, chief minister Edappadi Palaniswamy and his faction of AIADMK, at last, won the vote of confidence as all six division of MLAs voted in his favour. \nHowever, the starting phase of the session witnessed some upheaval and rift and was later adjourned twice. As the morning floor test proceedings started, it looked like it would be concluded on an easy note. But soon, massive fights for secret ballot erupted and DMK leader MK Stalin was forced evicted along with other DMK MLAs. As per the constitution, the MLAs who disturbed the house can be expelled and by a resolution and their seats can be declared vacant. Meanwhile, speaker P Dhanapal was heckled by the DMK leaders as E Palaniswami had proposed a confidence motion. \nAlso watch: \nOpposition leader M K Stalin had heated arguments with the Palaniswami and the speaker of the house asking for a secret ballot for the vote of confidence motion to be conducted. However, Speaker Dhanpal, however had stood his ground and had informed the legislators that they could not interfere with his powers. He further questioned the urgency with which the vote of confidence motion was asked for, especially when the governor had given 15 days to Palaniswami.
