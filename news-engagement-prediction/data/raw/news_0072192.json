Our investigating team is still working on it. We have to wait for our Forensics Unit to conduct an analysis.\n“If we find something, we will liaise with the Chemistry Department for confirmation,” he said at Ampang Jaya yesterday.\nComm Abdul Samah said police were also probing whether the chemicals were produced locally or had been brought into the country from abroad.\nHe also said that the police were waiting for a report from the Chemistry Department to determine if chemicals other than the VX nerve agent were used in the assassination of Jong-nam.\n“We are still looking into this. We haven’t come up with anything. We have never said that this poison, or chemical, was brought in from elsewhere.\n“What has been clearly identified these few days is the type of poison or chemical used. But we did not say where it came from. Let the facts be clear,” he added.\nThe Star reported that a Hazmat team from the KLCC fire station was called to participate in a drill with the police at the police aca­demy in Cheras on Thursday.\nThe team was then brought to a condominium in Jalan Klang Lama, where police seized various chemicals, several pairs of gloves and shoes from one of the units in the investigation of Jong-nam’s assassination.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:39:00.171+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
