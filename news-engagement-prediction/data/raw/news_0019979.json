Article continues below \nThings got off to a great start for Arsenal. They created several opportunities early on but eventually broke the deadlock through Alexis Sanchez just after the half hour mark. \nThe Chilean was somewhat fortunate that referee Mark Clattenburg and his assistant failed to notice the ball coming off Sanchez’s hand before it crossed the line. Article continues below \nNot that Arsenal will care. Sanchez bagged his 16th league goal of the season, equalling the total he scored in 2014-15. Togetherness \nThe reaction to Arsenal’s recent form has been typically fierce, with more and more fans joining the chorus of cries for Wenger to quit the club. But while supporters may be split on their opinion of the manager, they all can agree that Arsenal’s players need to show some togetherness. \nOne way in which that used to be achieved at Arsenal was through the captain’s decision to choose the length of the sleeves the players wore during matches. It’s a long-standing tradition that, according to Museum of Jerseys , dates back to the 1966-67 season. The tradition has been forgotten \nBut over recent years, it seems as if the tradition has been forgotten. In 2013, Mathieu Flamini cut the sleeves against Manchester United, and was told not to do it again. \nAnd fans on Twitter noticed that Theo Walcott was also wearing a different sleeve style to that of Gunners’ skipper Laurent Koscielny. \nCheck out the pictures below. Arsenal fans react \nSome are wondering if Walcott decided to roll the sleeves of his jersey up. It’s pretty hard to tell. \nArsenal fan account @DailyCannon even contacted someone at the club to investigate. Principles \nOf course, some will excuse the importance of it. Personal preference and all. \nBut Arsenal’s heroes of yesteryear might just be wondering what’s happened to the club’s principles. Does it really matter if a player breaks the sleeve tradition?
