'It's not about what we need this year, or next year, it's about the future,' said Internet Australia CEO Laurie Patton in a media release. 'It's about our ability to compete in a digitally-enabled world where other countries have high speed broadband networks that already leave us behind.' Australia ranked number 46 in a 2015 global survey of internet speeds - below Thailand and New Zealand. Emma Gilmour, corporate public affairs manager for NBN, told Daily Mail Australia that Mr Morrow's comments were 'taken out of context' in some media reports. She clarified that NBN actually offers one-gigabit per second speeds to 1.5million households, but that broadband retailers have chosen not to make the option available to consumers. She said market research shows that most customers don't even take advantage of 100-megabit per second speeds. Today, 80 percent of customers have opted for 25-megabit per second or less broadband connections, Ms Gilmour said. National Broadband Network CEO Bill Morrow said there isn't a 'big demand' for top-speed broadband ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T07:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T12:00:11.359+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
