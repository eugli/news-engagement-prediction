My uncle modeled for me the Buddhist virtue of always helping others. \nThat is why I am risking the well-being of my family still in Tibet, where I left behind my mother and 6-year-old daughter, to come here to speak publicly of my uncle’s murder and to call upon the UN to pressure China to conduct a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding his conviction and ultimate death. \nThroughout his years in prison, my uncle’s rights were grossly violated. He was repeatedly beaten, kept in isolation, denied his rights under Chinese law to regular visits from his family and denied medical treatment and medical parole. \nNow, I ask, if my uncle died of cardiac arrest, as the Chinese authorities claim, then why do they not provide us copies of the death certificate or medical records? \nWhy did they not conduct a post-mortem exam to determine the cause of death? \nWhy did they deny us the body for proper Buddhist burial and insist the cremation be done immediately? \nWhy did they detain my mother and me for more than two weeks after my uncle’s death and, insist, as a condition of our release, that we make no accusations against the Chinese authorities that he died of poisoning? \nAfter many months of my family being under surveillance, with a CCTV camera being placed outside the gate of our home, visitors to our home being arrested, Chinese officials and security personnel watching us constantly and my freedom of movement severely restricted, I decided to flee to India to appeal to the international community for assistance in our case and to bring attention to the cause of the many political prisoners in Tibet sill being subjected to the same fate as my uncle. \nChina, a member of the UN Human Rights Council, has been the illegal occupier of Tibet since 1949. In the nearly 70 years since, China has trampled the rights and freedoms of the Tibetan people, denying us our right to practice our religion and preserve our language and cultural traditions, closely monitoring our day to day activities, destroying our environmental resources, and curtailing our freedom of movement. China is known for trying to silence its critics, even at the UN. \nToday, there are thousands of Tibetan political prisoners, victims of China’s widespread practice of arbitrary detention. Among these is Tashi Wangchuk, whose sole crime was advocating for greater Tibetan language education, and now, like my uncle, stands accused of inciting separatism. Tibet’s prisoners are routinely subjected to brutal torture and their health deteriorates quickly due to the harsh conditions. \nSadly, the world is silent in the face of these abuses. Not only has the UN’s highest human rights body failed to produce a single resolution, special session or inquiry on gross abuses in China, but the Communist regime sits there as a member, judging others. \nIt is my sincere hope that my being at the Geneva Summit today, and speaking out on behalf of my people, will help bring China to account for the situation in Tibet — and for my uncle’s death. \nLhamo is a Tibetan activist who today addresses the Geneva Summit for Human Rights, an annual gathering of dissidents who defy dictatorships.
