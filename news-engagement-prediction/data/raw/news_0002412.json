Slot to Georgia Links \nMost Georgia fans are still smiling about the group of players Kirby Smart and his coaching staff brought in on Wednesday. The Bulldogs signed a total of 26 players, adding three of them on National Signing Day and having six enroll early (in January) to the university. \nSmart believes the Bulldogs became a bigger, faster, and more physical football team with this class, but one thing that really impressed him about the current group was its loyalty. \n\"This class was unique to the fact that I think there were 12 to 13 kids who only visited one place,\" Smart said on Wednesday. \"In today’s day and age, that’s really unique when it comes to official visits. If you’ve got 12 or 13 guys who said, ‘that’s where I’m going,’ I don’t even need to go visit anywhere else.” (Photo: UGA Athletics: Jon Paul Van Wert) \nThe benefits of having half the class never waver in its commitment are many. It certainly prevented more sleepless nights. When you consider all the moving parts with visits, roster spots, meeting needs, and things of that nature, not having to worry about half of your class visiting other schools is major. \nThe biggest benefit, however, may not be seen until a year or two from not. \n\"That’s always the key to getting a good class is how fast can you get started on the next class?\" Smart said when discussing the benefits of having so few commitments take additional visits. \"Meanwhile, while we were recruiting this class we were able to see some 2018 and 2019 guys out there.” Not a member?

It's an opportunity to take a flight to a place a prospect may not have a chance to see otherwise. Ameer Speed , a signing day addition for UGA, flew from Jacksonville, Fla. all the way across the country to Eugene, Ore. the final weekend before National Signing Day. \nThat's pretty common. With all the hard work and dedication it takes to become an athlete successful enough to earn a full scholarship, many players feel like it's a right -- maybe even a duty -- to get the most out of the experience. \nSmart believes that so many in the Bulldogs' 2017 class elected to give up that opportunity for a couple of reasons. \n\"You could make the case that ‘oh, they only went one place because you’re the only one that wanted them.’ I certainly don’t think that’s the case,\" Smart said. \"I think a lot of these kids, they knew what they wanted to do. A lot of them were really close to us, so they didn’t have to go other places, they could just stop by here and do what they wanted to on the weekend. It was always important to keep those guys as a tight-knit group. They put a lot of pressure on each other to not go places. Sometimes peer pressure gets to them more than any. We’re obviously thankful to get that group that didn’t go anywhere. \n(What's next for the Bulldogs?
