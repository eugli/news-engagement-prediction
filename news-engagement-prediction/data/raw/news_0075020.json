When he got out of the cart to collect payment, the victim told police the third person, later identified as Parry, hit him on the head and left the scene in the cart. \nPolice were later called to a hit and run collision nearby, where responding officers found the golf cart crashed into a gate. Officers later found Parry on the sidewalk, apparently drunk, according to police. \nHe was arrested on suspicion of robbery, auto theft, criminal damage, resisting arrest and driving under the influence, according to police. \nThe 6-foot-2, 300-pound lineman was a fifth round draft pick for the Colts in 2015. In his first two seasons with the team, he has started every game and has been in on 49 tackles, including four sacks. \nMessages left with the team were not immediately returned Monday night. \nThis story will be updated. \nCall IndyStar reporter Holly Hays at (317) 444-6156.
