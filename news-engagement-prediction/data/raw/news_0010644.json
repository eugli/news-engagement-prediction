It was recorded for a new Target ad, which will air during the 59th Grammy Awards next week. Listen to a snippet of their version below. \nIn a new interview with Entertainment Weekly , Jepsen also briefly discussed her new album. The follow-up to her 2015 album E•MO•TION apparently has a Donna Summer influence on it: “That would be the disco inspiration that’s leading the pack at the moment,” she said. “That said, some of the songs that have surprised me have not been in the disco realm as much. I can’t really put my finger on what it is, but that’s exciting too.” Jepsen is currently working with Robyn producer Patrik Berger and Miike Snow’s Pontus Winnberg on her new material.
