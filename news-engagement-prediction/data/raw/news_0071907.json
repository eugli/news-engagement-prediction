Maloney’s initiative gained traction after it was posted to Reddit and it has since garnered international media attention. \nSegel hasn’t responded to this challenge (as of this writing), but the How I Met Your Mother actor’s sister tweeted about it. \nREAD MORE: Leah Remini: Tom Cruise could ‘end’ Scientology if he wanted to \n“theres a man on youtube whose brand is eating photos of my brother on video & my 1st reaction was: how do i get someone 2 eat pictures of me,” Ali Segel wrote. theres a man on youtube whose brand is eating photos of my brother on video & my 1st reaction was: how do i get someone 2 eat pictures of me \n— Ali Segel (@OnlineAlison) February 17, 2017 \nMaloney eats many of his Segel photos at home but he’s also been recorded eating a photo while walking through Toronto’s Kensington Market. \nHe has also been recorded eating a photo of the Forgetting Sarah Marshall actor while getting Segel’s name tattooed on him. \nREAD MORE: Lindsay Lohan claims she was ‘racially profiled’ while wearing headscarf \n“Essentially we think he’s seen it and if anything he’s going to give it a few days or something,” Maloney said in reference to Segels sister’s tweet, while speaking to Toronto radio station 102.1 The Edge on Feb. 21. \nWhen asked if he was going to “up the game,” Maloney said, “We have a lot of different ideas. Yesterday we went to the Eaton Centre and I stood up on a table. We had to do that really quick before security came, so we’re trying to do as many different things as we can, keep it fresh and just do a bunch of different things.” \nMaloney also believes that it’s going to be much harder to do anything crazier than the “JASON SEGEL” tattoo. He also said the only thing that will stop him from eating the actor’s face every day is if Segel eats the photo of him. \nPeople on Twitter have been discussing the #EatMyFaceSegel videos — some supported the initiative, while others derided Maloney. #EatMyFaceSegel is the best thing to ever come from Woodstock \n— Serena Boudreau (@serenadeanb) February 17, 2017 @zestynoah You are BLOWING UP!
