LeBron took exception and called Chuck a “hater”. \nMore words were said, but in today’s day and age, social media blew it up into a viral story. \nEarlier today, one of LeBron’s best friends Dwyane Wade offered his support of his former teammate and agreed that it was time for him to put Barkley in his place. \nHere were his exact words, via K.C. Johnson of the Chicago Tribune. \nWhile some people might view those comments as a bit hypocritical considering Wade’s current situation in Chicago, it’s obvious that he had LeBron’s back 100 percent. \nCarmelo Anthony, also a close friend to LeBron, also chimed in to support his buddy. \nYou can sense that he was really speaking from the heart there and that a little bit of that statement was him talking about himself, but he also defended LeBron in the escalating battle. \nFor years, Barkley has been offering his blatantly honest options as an NBA analyst for Turner Sports. Known for his direct and unforgiving takes, he captivates fans and viewers every time he speaks because he’s not afraid to say anything. \nBecause of his style, he often times comes off as being harsh or overly critical of certain players and for whatever reason, LeBron has always been someone that Barkley has criticized. \nTherefore, LeBron, who clearly pays close attention to what the media says, had enough and finally snapped. \nJudging by the responses of D-Wade and Melo, this was something that has been bothering King James for a long time. \nIt remains to be seen whether or not more NBA players will speak out in defense of either man. \nUntil then, we can only eat up the drama in what is currently the juiciest fight happening in the NBA.
