Likewise, Islamic agencies like Jais and Jakim and even mainstream media are invariably pursuing the proselytisation angle. \nBut this cannot justify his abduction which was professionally executed in under 40 seconds, according to those who have seen the CCTV recordings... \nFor the rest of this story and more, subscribe for only RM150 a year.
