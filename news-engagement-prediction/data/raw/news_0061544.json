Styles says the theory should not be discounted. \nDuring Tuesday’s episode of Talking Smack on WWE Network, Smackdown Live general manager Daniel Bryan asked Styles if he wanted to talk about being a “flat Earther.” \n“I’m not a ‘flat-earther’,” Styles said. “I’m just saying there is some stuff about it that makes sense. I don’t think you can handle it.” \nBryan explained to Styles that the Earth was a sphere and host Renee Young talked about how the earth spins on its axis. More Kyrie Irving!
