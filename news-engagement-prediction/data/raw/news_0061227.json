MAARTEN HOLL/FAIRFAX NZ \nErin Buckland works on her training drills at the Basin Reserve. \nErin was the first female to join the all-male Levin Old Boys Cricket Club team in 100 years and was recognised for her passion by the ANZ Dream Deliveries promotion, which promotes cricket across the country. \nREAD MORE: \n\"This will be a day she won't ever forget,\" her mum Nicola Buckland said. Advertisement MAARTEN HOLL/FAIRFAX NZ \nLevin's Erin Buckland is presented a bat from Black Caps Tom Latham, left, Tim Southee, Ross Taylor and Mitchell Santner. \nErin originally wanted to start cricket about three years ago, Buckland said. \nHowever \"I actually discouraged her, I said let her brother do it. I would like him to do something without you going in and being fantastic at it.\" \nBut once she started \"she just took to it naturally and loved it\". \n\"She could do it every night.\" \nBuckland helped found an all girls cricket coaching clinic in her region with Central Hinds coach Mikaela Greig and dreams of one day joining the White Ferns. \nSpin bowler Santner was picked out as a favourite by the gaggle of girls gathered at the Basin. \n\"Obviously, when I was in school if the Black Caps rocked up I'd be like, what is going on,\" the Hamilton all-rounder said. \nHe said it was great to help see girls' presence growing in the game and \"quite cool to interact with them and see their love for the game just like us.\" \nIn addition to the training session, Erin received a kit bag, and a bowling machine and gear bag for the girls' cricket coaching clinic. \n\" [Erin] is so clearly an inspiration to the girls in the region, and we hope that by giving her and her teammates a once-in-a-lifetime experience, we will only continue to inspire her to achieve,\" ANZ head of sponsorship and corporate marketing Sue McGregor said. \nIt will be back to school for Erin on Friday, but she will go back with a one in a lifetime experience. \nThe Black Caps are in Wellington ahead of their third one-day international match against South Africa at Westpac Stadium on Saturday.
