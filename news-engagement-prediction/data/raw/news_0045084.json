The US market overtook the UK during the 20th century, and has since ballooned into the world's dominant stock market, representing 53.2% of global capitalization at the end of 2016. But, Japan had the world's largest market for a hot second: At the start of 1990, it made up almost 45% of the world index, above the United States' 30%, according to Credit Suisse's data. \n\"Our 23 countries accounted for 98% of world equity market capitalization at the start of 1900, and today they still represent some 91% of the investable universe,\" the team wrote. \nAs an interesting aside that Credit Suisse did not go into, the relative size of stock markets somewhat mirrors the relative geopolitical power of a given country on the global stage. \nFor example, the UK's stock market was the largest at the end of 1899 near the end of Queen Victoria's reign and the \" Britain's imperial century .\" But its relative size shrank after the two World Wars and during the Pax Americana . \nIn any case, check out the two charts (Note: \"Smaller Yearbook\" includes countries from among those listed above who had small enough markets to be grouped together, while \"not in Yearbook\" represents mostly emerging market countries for which the team did not have data going back to 1900.) \nCredit Suisse ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:07:50.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
