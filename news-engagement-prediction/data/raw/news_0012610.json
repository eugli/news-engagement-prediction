The parade will start at 11 a.m. ET, and the Patriots will make their trip around the city and take the familiar ride in the famous duck boats. \nFor anyone who has forgotten what a Patriots parade looks like check out some of the highlights from the 2015 event. And if Bostonians thought that win, sealed by Malcolm Butler’s interception of Russell Wilson’s pass at the goal line was dramatic, it almost pales in comparison to Sunday’s comeback against the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI in Houston.
