Yes, our seemingly progressive state is lagging behind the standard of brutality that is de rigueur in the Northern Territory youth justice system.\nAnd this week the Andrews government announced a bold plan to rival our northern counterparts. Youth justice, which has been the domain of health and human services, will now be transferred to the Department of Justice and Regulation, and all youth justice facilities will be managed by Corrections Victoria.\nIn November, the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service fought hard alongside the Human Rights Law Centre and others to keep Aboriginal children and young people out of adult prisons.\nJenny Mikakos denies losing control of youth justice in Victoria Read more \nWhile that was a short-term victory, the news that a new high-security detention centre run by Corrections Victoria is to be built demonstrates a long-term planning failure in the area of youth justice, and an underhand move to treat children and young people like adult inmates.\nThis decision coincides with the gazetting of the use of capsicum spray, tear gas and extendable batons on top of frequent 23-hour lockdowns, separation and isolation.\nIt’s as if this government wants a royal commission, akin to that of Don Dale.\nThe building of this new, high-security centre is a decision based not on fact, but on fear.\nContrary to the scaremongering that suggests teenagers are on a criminal rampage, the Sentencing Advisory Council recently released data showing the number of children and young people sentenced for offences had steadily declined each year – nearly half of the sentenced offences recorded in 2008.\nYet the rates of reoffending remain high – 40% of children reoffend within two years and 61% reoffend within six years.\nWhy is this?\n'We can’t lock young people up': Victoria warned on tough youth justice measures Read more \nThe recent Youth Parole Board annual report states that 63% of young people in youth justice are victims of abuse, trauma or neglect. Many come from broken families subject to family violence. At least 40% have an adult family member in prison.\nAt least 80% are only on remand, waiting for an agonisingly slow “justice” system to process their cases, and are often denied bail because they simply have nowhere to go. \nMany reoffend for the same reason – they are out on the streets, to escape family violence, abuse and neglect.\nThese are children who need counselling, education and community support – not to be locked in a room 23 hours a day, subjected to capsicum spray and tear gas attacks, fearful of heavily armed baton-wielding guards. \nThe Andrews’ government, however, says that of the 224 beds in the new “fit-for-purpose, high security” youth justice system, only 12 will be for mental health patients.\nThat means, despite the Youth Parole Board stating that 62% of children and young people in detention have suffered abuse, 30% have mental health issues and 18% have a history of self-harm and suicidal tendencies, less than 6% of the beds in the new detention centre will be for mental health patients.\nYouth prison with 'highest security Victoria has seen' to be built by 2021 Read more \nHigh security? Yes. \nFit for purpose? Definitely not. \nCreating the next generation of adult offenders? Certainly.\nIf the Andrews government is serious about reducing youth offending and stemming the flow of adult incarceration, it needs a drastic rethink of its new high-security prison.\nTherapeutic sentencing options that resolve to address the root causes of youth offending are necessary, and are recommended by the Youth Parole Board. \nMore batons, lockdowns, isolation, sprays and gases will only add to a child or young person’s trauma – it certainly will not decrease it.\nWhat Victoria needs is a solution to young offending based on fact, not fear. \nOtherwise we are well on the way to a Don Dale-style royal commission.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T06:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:55:27.767+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
