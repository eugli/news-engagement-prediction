It has been shifted to a different date, but in an unusual move, Paramount, the studio behind the undead adventure, did not provide a new release date. Nor did the studio offer up timing for when “Friday the 13th” will grace screens, beyond saying that the horror reboot will no longer debut in October. Paramount did reveal that “mother!,” a new film from Darren Aronofsky and Jennifer Lawrence, will hit theaters on October 13, 2017. That was the date when “Friday the 13th” was originally slated to premiere. It also should put “mother!” in the heart of the awards season race. “World War Z 2” was originally slated to debut on June 9, 2017, which would have put it against “The Mummy,” a horror adventure with Tom Cruise that will also try to attract younger crowds. The extra time will be used to develop the script. Paramount is hoping to release the film in 2018 or 2019, according to an insider. “mother!” will face off against “The Snowman,” a thriller with Michael Fassbender; “The Commuter,” an action film with Liam Neeson; and “Marshall” a historical drama with Chadwick Boseman about Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. The first “World War Z” was one of the biggest hits of Brad Pitt’s career, earning $540 million globally. Watch trailers , movies and more on Yahoo View , available now on iOS and Android .
