He said within a month parents will see results.\nPOWERING OFF DURING THE SCHOOL WEEK \nFor busy mom of four Jenn Lapkin, keeping the television and tablets off, and kids focused on old fashioned activities is a priority.\n\"Starting from when the kids were really young when they had TV early in the day, they would lose their minds,\" said Lapkin.\nTwo years ago the family cut out screen time during the school week.\nLapkin thinks it’s important for kids to keep up with technology, but is also aware of a growing body of medical research pointing to screen time being addictive.\nLapkin said at first the transition unplugging was a challenge, and there are exceptions to the rule. Her 13-year-old son goes on the computer for half an hour on school nights. The others can use screens if it's for homework.\nSCREENS IN THE CLASSROOM \nAt Lakewood School, grade four and five students are learning augmented reality, stock motion and math with iPads.\nOn average they spend about 30 minutes a day on the devices.\nThe St. James-Assiniboia School Division has about 2000 iPads in circulation for students.\nAddictions expert Nicholas Kardaras doesn't think tablets have a place in the classroom. He said students can figure out how to use them when they're older.\n“The tech industry has given a false narrative that screens are educational,” he said.\nBut teacher Nadia Cantafio said having them in class doesn't just give students an edge, it's also instilling healthy living habits.\n\"If we can teach them those tools early when to take it out, when to put them away. We do talk about at bedtime, ‘are you keeping your cell phone and iPhone in your bedroom? Or are you charging them in the family basket downstairs? Out of sight out of mind,\" Cantafio added.\n\"The message to our teachers is everything doesn't have to be with a computer,” said Rob Carnegie, IT director with the St. James-Assiniboia School Division. “At school I don't it's think it's as big an issue as it is for parents struggling with it at home. The time that kids are clocking in, that excessive time is really in the evenings and weekends.”\n\nHELPING KIDS UNPLUG \nJulie-Anne McCarthy researches kids’ screen time and promotes mental health.\nAccording to her data, some kids spend as much as eight hours a day in front of a screen.\n\"Have a look at how much time their child is really spending in front of a screen and then designate specific places and times they will not have access to their electronics,\" McCarthy added.\nShe said the most important thing is for kids to have fun without electronics, and recommends powering down at meal time and keeping devices out of the bedroom.\nHOW MUCH IS TOO MUCH? \nThe Canadian Pediatric Society discourages screen-based activities for children under two.\nDr. Grant MacDougall said three hours a day is too much for little kids.\nAddictions expert Nicholas Kardaras said parents should wait until kids are at least 10 to expose them to portable screen time.\nKardaras, who treats screen addictions, said they can be harder than beating a drug addiction, because unlike drugs or alcohol it's virtually impossible not to engage.\n\nPhotos The Lapkin family cut out screen time during the week two years ago.
