The student’s description of the white male in question was fairly detailed: 20 to 30 years old, average height, athletic build, bad body odor, unkempt appearance and intoxicated with slurred speech. \nPolice soon characterized the claim as ethnic intimidation, and outrage on campus that began after Trump’s election intensified. \nBut after Ann Arbor police looked into the matter further — with help from the FBI and campus police — they concluded the student made it up . \n“Investigators conducted witness interviews and reviewed multiple surveillance videos of the area in question,” the updated report read. “During the course of the investigation, numerous inconsistencies in the statements provided by the alleged victim were identified. Following a thorough investigation, detectives have determined the incident in question did not occur.” \nSteven Hiller, chief assistant prosecutor, told the College Fix the office “will not comment further on this case.” \nAfter the hoax was uncovered in December, police said the unidentified woman could be charged with filing a false police report, MLive reported . \n“Sending it to the prosecutor’s office is standard procedure when the investigation has revealed the incident as reported was false, and the person who reported knows it’s false,” Ann Arbor Police Detective Lt. Matthew Lige told the outlet. \nA felony charge also could have been filed against the woman since the crime she reported — ethnic intimidation — is itself a felony, MLive added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T01:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T20:42:58.318+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
