But the world has changed and businesses need to increase their opening hours to fit in with modern lifestyles. \nPenalty rates will be one of the controversial issues considered by the Productivity Commission in its sweeping review of industrial relations this year. While the Abbott government has committed to not changing penalty rates, business groups and unions have strongly held views on their place in the modern workplace. SHARE The role of penalty rates divides workers and businesses. Photo: Michele Mossop \nWe hear from two people affected by penalty rates – a business owner who thinks current penalty rates are too tough on employers and a worker who relies on penalty rates to make ends meet: The business owner: Penalty rates are too high and too complicated \nJon Page, bookstore owner Share on Twitter TWEET Link Whether to pay workers penalty rates for public holidays, or shut for the day, is a vexed issue for employers. Photo: Chris Hopkins \nEvery small business owner wants to pay their workers a fair wage and wants to compensate them for doing extra hours or working outside what is considered normal hours. But it is about getting the balance right to make it work for the business owners, the consumer and employees. \nPenalty rates need to reflect what is happening in society. The growth of ecommerce means consumers' expectations are to be able to shop at any time, regardless of the day of the week or the date on the calendar. People's work habits have also changed and weekends for a lot of people aren't necessarily a Saturday or Sunday. Unfortunately penalty rates as they are today do not reflect this change nor have any flexibility. Advertisement \nIn recent years there has been a dramatic increase in penalty rates in a bid to try and get uniform penalty rates across the country. Unfortunately this change did not take into consideration different business conditions that exist between states nor did it take into consideration the change in consumer behaviour over the past 20 years. \nWhen we first opened our bookshop in 1995 we would only open a half day on Sunday as this was the quietest day of the week. Sundays are now one of our busiest days. Being busy does not equate to being profitable when costs we cannot control are too high. Sunday is now one of our least staffed days as we battle to keep those costs down. SHARE Owner of Pages and Pages Booksellers Jon Page. Photo: Michel O'Sullivan \nIn the past we used to employ a high number of casual staff. It gave us flexibility and fitted in with the university students and others we employed who also needed to be flexible with their time. With the higher penalty rates we now rely on full time staff on a salary rather than an hourly rate. This is the best way we can keep control of our wage costs but has the effect of removing opportunities for students and others who can only work on weekends. \nPenalty rates are an important right, even more so in the modern world. However they do need to reflect the modern world of business, of the changed consumer behaviours and the broader changes in society, not reflect yesterday's values and behaviours. Basically penalty rates are too high and too complicated and this needs to change. \nJon Page owns and runs Pages & Pages Booksellers in Mosman \n**** The worker: I need penalty rates more than ever \nPatrick Cullen, retail worker \nIf penalty rates were to be abolished or decreased, thousands of Australians including myself would find ourselves in seriously dire straits. \nI'm 26 and I've just completed a three-year advanced diploma on top of my previous communications degree. While studying, my financial security has been completely dependant on my ability to work for penalty rates in retail on weekends and nights. Because the truth is working in retail sucks. It does. And while it's a lot more fun than laying bricks in Baghdad, the pressure and the manual labour included in the job is really not taken into account by either the employers or customers. Retail assistants are expected to be oracles, charities, counsellors, self help guides, life coaches and stylists - all for meagre pay and monotonous work. \nI'm well aware that I am lucky to have a job at all, and am really thankful to my employer for giving me the gig. But, at a base rate of $19.83 an hour and up to thirty hours a week of required classes and study combined with a weekly rent of $240, the weekly budget is a tight one. Without the addition of time and a half on Saturdays and double on Sundays I wouldn't be able to afford my home and could find myself as one of the thousands of young homeless Australians. \nThis is a situation people across Australia are finding themselves in, especially here in Sydney. And it's not just young retail workers – employees of all ages in hospitality, nursing, the emergency services, manufacturing and more all rely on compensation for working odd hours. \nRent is outrageously expensive. The cost of living is high and for the most part it has increased without real relevance to wages. \nIf that wasn't concerning enough, with the government's proposed higher education reforms, young Australians already under financial pressure are staring down the barrel of staying home until they're 30 or choosing not furthering their education at all. \nI have a close friend who lost his job and was kicked out of home in the same week. This incredibly bright guy found himself living on the streets for close to two years. It was only thanks to a friend getting him a job stacking shelves and the University of Western Sydney's student housing program that he was able to get himself back on his feet. \nSadly that is not an uncommon story, and if these changes come into effect it's only going to get worse. \nPatrick Cullen is an actor who also works in retail.
