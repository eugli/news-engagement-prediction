Published February 3, 2017 \nBy Frank Miniter, Fox News \nCan the mainstream media have it both ways, even with the Super Bowl? \nMany in the media like to feign being above the political fray as they talk about about the partisan divide separating not just political parties, but also so much of America into red- and blue-leaning precincts. \nBut then they step on what is a great coming together for America, the Super Bowl, by playing up the politics. \nReporters noticed that New England Patriots’ quarterback Tom Brady, who will be playing in his seventh Super Bowl on Sunday, had a “Make America Great Again” hat in his locker earlier this year and have never let it drop since. President Donald Trump, as someone running for president will, did keep the story alive by boasting about Brady’s support on many occasions. \nBrady, however, has declined to get political. Earlier this week he told USA Today: “If people want to take sides, you know, they can obviously do that. It’s everyone’s right. They have a right to do that. And I have a right to stay out of it, too.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:41:32.432+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
