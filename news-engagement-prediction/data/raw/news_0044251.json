Initiative overload \nBut the MPs say that there is no clear long-term plan to address this - and they suggest there should be greater efforts to keep teachers from leaving the profession and moving to other jobs. \nFigures last year showed that almost a third of new teachers who had started jobs in English state schools in 2010 had left within five years. \nThe MPs want measures to tackle problems that make people leave teaching - such as an \"unmanageable workload\" or a lack of professional development. \n\"The government needs to do more to encourage teachers to stay in the profession by raising the status of teachers, improving the opportunities for good quality training, and by doing all it can to help reduce teacher workload,\" said Neil Carmichael, who chairs the committee. \nHe said the government could consider \"holding fire\" on policy changes that added to the pressure on schools. \nAnd he suggested schools needed time to support staff development without constantly being \"distracted by the demands of the latest Whitehall directive\". \nMalcolm Trobe, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union said: \"The crisis in teacher supply has a direct impact on the education that schools are able to provide to their pupils. \n\"It means that important subjects like maths and science have to be covered by teachers who are not specialists in these subjects and that schools have to increasingly rely on supply staff.\" \nMinisters have argued that they have kept teaching as an attractive profession in a competitive jobs market. \nThere have been a series of high-profile advertising campaigns for teaching and there are financial incentives focused on attracting recruits into shortage subjects. \nA Department for Education spokesman said: \"There are more teachers in England's schools than ever before, with secondary postgraduate recruitment at its highest since 2011. \n\"We are investing more than £1.3bn in recruitment over this Parliament and have recruited more trainees in key subjects like physics and maths than last year.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T03:06:18.742+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
