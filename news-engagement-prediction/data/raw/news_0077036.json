(Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP) kabc   06:48PM HOLLYWOOD, LOS ANGELES -- The 2017 Oscars is starting off with an upbeat tone, along with a healthy serving of political jokes, but the award show also made history Sunday night as it handed out its first award to Mahershala Ali for best supporting actor, making him the first ever Muslim to win a gold statuette.Singer Justin Timberlake kicked off the Academy Awards with a politics-free performance of his Oscar-nominated song \"Can't Stop the Feeling.\"Kimmel didn't stray entirely from politics. He took a shot at President Donald Trump, saying his policies had made the Oscars seem \"less racist.\"He also struck an irreverent but sarcastic tone, singling out best actress nominee Meryl Streep, whom Trump previously called \"overrated\" after her fiery Golden Globes speech last month. Listing some of her credits, Kimmel said she \"phoned it in for over 50 films.\" He also led a standing ovation for the actress before telling her: \"Nice dress, by the way. Is that an Ivanka?\"The host then said Trump was sure to tweet about the Oscars at 5 a.m. \"during his bowl movements.\"The night's first winner was Ali for his performance in \"Moonlight.\" He thanked his wife for \"being such a soldier\" while being pregnant during the making of the film. The couple welcomed their daughter four days ago. The Associated Press contributed to this report.
