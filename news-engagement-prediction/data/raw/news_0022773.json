The principle opposition party has demanded that the PM apologise to Singh for saying “people should learn from Dr Singh how to bathe in bathroom wearing a raincoat ” , alluding to his blemish-free reputation while heading a ‘scam-riddled’ government. \nTop Congress leaders huddled on Thursday morning and decided to stall proceedings in Rajya Sabha and stage protests in the lower House. \nIt’s not clear if the protests would lead to a washout of the rest of the session in the Rajya Sabha, but the disruptions are likely to disrupt a large part of the budget session.

He enjoys an aura and respect from the party’s rank and file. Even as the UPA 2 administration was marred in corruption charges, the Congress leadership -- especially party president Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul -- stood like a rock beside Singh. \nThe party has reached out to other Opposition outfits to garner a united onslaught against the BJP over the PM’s remarks. \n“On one hand, Modi seeks cooperation from all parties to run the House and push bills. On the other hand, he attacks Manmohan Singh who is an epitome of cooperation. Singh had always believed in consensus politics. So, he (Narendra Modi) actually doesn’t want cooperation,” said Md Selim, politburo member of the CPI(M). \nDuring his intervention in the debate on President’s speech, PM spoke about how Singh had been involved in the economic policy-making of India for almost 35 years. \n“There have been so many scams. But he has maintained an unblemished image. People should learn from Dr. Singh the art of bathing in bathroom wearing a rain coat,” Modi quipped. \nHe recalled how Singh had said “organised plunder and loot” to describe demonetisation and added, “If someone used such words, then he should also be ready to hear the reply.” tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T20:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:53:49.776+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
