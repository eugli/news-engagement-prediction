Remember when we used to derive “full forms” out of the names of our friends, in the fifth grade? Well, apparently all politicians in India seem to have turned into fifth-graders, starting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who in his first rally in Uttar Pradesh after the state polls were announced, asked the people in Uttar Pradesh to \"rid the state of SCAM - S for Samajwadi (party), C for Congress, A for Akhilesh (Yadav) and M for Mayawati\". We can do without the acronymistis, and so can Uttar Pradesh. [Photo: Indiatoday.in] This is not the first time that the prime minister has used ridiculous acronyms. RSVP (Rahul, Sonia, Vadra, Priyanka), SABKA (SaPa, BaSaPa, Congress), USTTAD (Upgrading Skills and Training in Traditional Arts/Crafts for Development), are just a few of the many, many crummy acronyms that the Modi government has come up with. But what made things worse – if possible – is how the SP-Congress alliance chose to retaliate. Akhilesh Yadav, the SP scion, corrected the acronym and said that it stood for \"Save Country from Amit (Shah) and Modi\". If that weren’t bad enough already, Rahul Gandhi made it worse. \"S infact stands for 'service', C for 'courage', A for 'ability' and M for 'modesty',\" said the Congress vice-president. \"Whenever Modi is nervous, he starts giving labels PPE, ABC, DEF, GHY. Now this SCAM.... A person, who is in the wrong, sees scam everywhere because this is his reality”, said Rahul Gandhi, while addressing a joint rally here with Uttar Pradesh. This bizarre series of acronyms has sent the social media on a frenzy, with people coming with their own versions of SCAM and NDA among other things.
