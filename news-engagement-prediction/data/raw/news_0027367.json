His latest creation, a balloon-powered organ, sounds like a delicate ocarina from a tiny origami world. \nZholner mainly worked on making engines until his wife suggested a music box, he wrote on a papercraft forum . That inspired him to take a more musical approach to this project. Unlike his past builds, he wrote that he's not planning to make templates available; it's too difficult to recreate, since each pipe and paper thickness have to be tuned perfectly. \nThe organ operates using a balloon attached to a series of pipes and valves, made entirely of paper except for a plastic window to see the folded paper springs moving inside the pipes.
