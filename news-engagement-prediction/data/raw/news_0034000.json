The French multi-national company said the chef did not hear Mr Tomlinson ask to pay later and he should have gone to a manager to get authorisation. Father-of-three Mr Tomlinson said: 'I am not and have never been a thief, I wound never steal anything, I can guarantee that. The father-of-three, pictured with a similar sandwich, has now been reinstated after staff threatened to go on strike over the matter 'It felt so bad to be called a thief, it rested heavy on my heart, it was a really dark time. 'But I had so many people in my corner to fight for me and so many of my colleagues came out to help me. 'Without them I don't know what I would have done, they were the only thing giving me hope. 'They tell me now I can go back to work, I can't believe it, it's great. I can't put into words how happy I am. 'Words can't express how I feel, I just want to say thank you to everyone who helped me.' A Sodexo spokesman said: 'We received an appeal, reviewed the situation and offered the employee reinstatement, which he has accepted. 'We look forward to seeing him back at work on Monday.' Michael Dooley, GMB union representative for the Redbridge branch said: 'There was an appeal process scheduled for Wednesday but as part of that appeal they have asked us to drop the protest while they look at the appeal. 'They have said he will be reinstated but we still have to get confirmation to make sure there's not going to be any catches like he gets moved to a hospital on the other side of London.' Speaking before he was reinstated, Mr Tomlinson said: ''When they told me I lost my job I couldn't stop crying. 'I can't even think about what's going to happen, I'm just thinking about my kids at the moment and about how I'm going to support after my family. Hundreds of co-workers also signed a petition demanding Mr Tomlinson, pictured, be given his job back 'It's literally so stressful, I don't know how I'm going to cope, it's a nightmare. 'I've never been accused of stealing in my life, I pay my own way.' Mr Tomlinson was originally sacked for gross misconduct by a disciplinary panel in line with its zero tolerance policy on February 7. It concluded: 'The management stated that you had been seen taking food from the restaurant without paying for it, two witness statements one stated that you had asked for a fried egg, serving yourself other items from the counter in a takeaway box and made a tea, not hearing what you said, walked away and past the till not paying. 'The other witness on the till stated that you had approached to obtain a knife and fork only.' It noted he had apologised and in mitigation 'stated that you had said that you were hungry from dealing with a domestic issue the night before and that you had arrived realising you had no money to pay. Sodexo, which runs catering services at the hospital, pictured, said it had received an appeal over the sacking and had offered Mr Tomlinson his job back 'Additionally you stated that there was no evidence to suggest there had been other occasions, you had stated to the chef and received a nod that you took as an indication you could pay later. 'You also stated that it is normal for colleagues to assist each other in need and that the amount was not significant but acknowledged a breach of trust and confidence could exist between the parties and requested leniency. 'You stated that you did not wish the humiliation of asking colleagues to borrow money and stated you felt less embarrassed to deal with things in the manner described. 'It is clear that there was a misunderstanding although on balance the panel believes that the misunderstanding was yours in that a cursory comment and nod could be interpreted as requesting permission and receiving permission and confirmed.' It added his 'request was not directed at somebody in authority.'
