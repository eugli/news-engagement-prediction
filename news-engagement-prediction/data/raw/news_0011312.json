to inform him of his intentions.\nThe conservative South Australian said he resigned from the party because of 'public disenchantment with the major parties'.\nMr Bernardi criticised the 'political class' for being out of touch in his address to the Senate at Parliament House in Canberra on Tuesday afternoon.\nScroll down for video\nConservative backbencher Cory Bernardi has informed the Senate he has quit the Liberal Party\nMr Bernardi is pictured being greeted by One Nation's Pauline Hanson on Tuesday afternoon\nMr Bernardi addressed the Senate about defecting from the Liberal Party\n'I stand here today, both reluctant and relieved,' he told the senate.\n'Reluctant because this decision has weighed heavy on my heart, but relieved because whilst it is difficult, I believe it is the right thing to do.'\nMr Bernardi said it was perhaps the most difficult decision of his political career but has decided it's how best he can best serve the national interests.\n'The level of public disenchantment with the major parties, the lack of confidence in our political process and the concern about the direction of our nation is very, very strong,' he told the Senate.\n'It is not in the interests of our nation to yield to the temptation of personality politics which shrink the debate to the opinion of a few, whilst compromising the good sense and values of the many,' Mr Bernardi told the Senate\nAt a press conference shortly afterwards, Mr Bernardi said he wanted to be a credible and sensible alternative to major parties\nMr Bernardi told a press conference afterwards the Liberal Party was 'foolish' to have a revolving door of prime minister\n'This is a direct product of us, the political class, being out of touch with the hopes and aspirations of the Australian people.'\nMr Bernardi could be seen shaking hands with One Nation leader Pauline Hanson after delivering the speech.\nGeorge Brandis then told the Senate it was 'a sad day for the Liberal Party'.\n'It is a sad day when someone leaves the family. Senator Bernardi will have to account to the Australian people and to his own conscience about how he can continue to sit in this Parliament having been elected as a Liberal, but that is a matter for him,' Mr Brandis said.\n'The level of public disenchantment with the major parties, the lack of confidence in our political process and the concern about the direction of our nation is very, very strong,' Mr Bernardi told the Senate\n'This is a direct product of us, the political class, being out of touch with the hopes and aspirations of the Australian people,' he said (pictured with Mathias Cormann)\nMr Brandis said the government expected Mr Bernardi to continue supporting government policies given they were the policies he stood for when elected.\nThe government will now need the support of nine of the 10 independent cross benchers to ensure any of its legislation clears the Senate against opposition from Labor and the Greens.\nLabor's Penny Wong said the government was 'bitterly divided' and 'coming apart at the seams'.\n'This resignation is a consequence of the failure of leadership by the prime minister,' she said.\nGreens leader Richard Di Natale then said if Mr Bernardi was serious about standing up for his beliefs, he would have left the Liberal Party before the election instead of securing six years in the senate.\nMr Bernardi is pictured waiting to announce his defection from the Liberal Party\nPauline Hanson of One Nation is pictured listening to Cory Bernardi announce his defection\nGreens leader Richard Di Natale was scathing of the new independent.\n'In Senator Bernardi we have 6.5 foot of ego but not an inch of integrity. Not an inch,' he said.\nAt a press conference shortly afterwards, Mr Bernardi said he wanted to be a credible and sensible alternative to major parties.\nHe said there was a growing disconnect between politicians and the public, and it was 'foolish' of the Liberal Party to oust prime minister Tony Abbott in 2015.\n'I did warn my party that what we condemned in Labor in a revolting door of prime ministers was foolish to repeat in our own circumstances,' he told reporters on Tuesday.\nLiberal Democratic Senator David Leyonhjelm listens to Mr Bernardi announce his defection\nLabor's Penny Wong said the government was 'bitterly divided' and 'coming apart at the seams'\nMinister for Employment Michaelia Cash listens to her former colleague defect\n'And there are those amongst us who say that was some kind of virtue to change leadership.\n'The transaction cost of that is still being felt today.\n'We want politics to be a force for good rather than mocked and ridiculed by most Australians.\n'After the last election I said there was a problem. We need to fix it,' he told reporters.\n'When the pollster says the base doesn't matter, when the election campaign is lacklustre and we hang on by one seat and trumped it as a great victory and no-one is investigating it, we have got a problem.'\nSenator Bernardi insists he hasn't approached any other MPs about joining his party.\nHe denied betraying Liberal voters, arguing his principles had remained consistent.\nEarlier in the morning, Mr Bernardi formally called Mr Turnbull to state his intention to resign from the Liberal Party.\nThe South Australian will sit on the crossbench as an independent, and will form a breakaway party called Australian Conservatives, Laurie Oakes told the Today Show .\nMr Bernardi appears to be getting bankrolled by mining magnate Gina Rinehart.\nWHAT SENATOR CORY BERNARDI TOLD PARLIAMENT\n'I stand here today, both reluctant and relieved. Reluctant because this decision has weighed heavy on my heart, but relieved because whilst it is difficult, I believe it is the right thing to do.\n'When as a younger man I joined the ship of state, I was in awe of its traditions and the great captains that it guided us on our way, but now as the seas through which we sail become ever more challenging, the respect for the values and principles that have served us well seem to have been set aside for expedient, self-serving, short-term ends.\n'That approach has not served our nation well.\n'There are few in this place or anywhere that can claim the respect for politicians and politics is stronger today than it was 10 years ago. In short, the body public is failing the people of Australia. It is clear that we need to find a better way.\n'The level of public disenchantment with the major parties, the lack of confidence in our political process and the concern about the direction of our nation is very, very strong.\n'This is a direct product of us, the political class, being out of touch with the hopes and aspirations of the Australian people.\n'Politics at its best has always been the shared contribution of men and women of conscience who bring their skills to bare for the benefit of the nation.\n'It is not in the interests of our nation to yield to the temptation of personality politics which shrink the debate to the opinion of a few, whilst compromising the good sense and values of the many.\n'For many years, I have warned of the consequences of ignoring the clear signs. I have spoken of the need to restore faith in our political system and to put principle back into politics.\n'I regret that too often these warnings have been ignored by those who perhaps needed to hear them most. It really is time for a better way. For a conservative way.\n'The enduring beauty of the conservative tradition is it looks to the past, to all that is good and great, to inform the future. It is a rich paradox where the established equips up for the new.\n'So today I begin something new, built on enduring values and principles that have served our nation so well for so long.\n'It is a political movement of Australian Conservatives. A community of individual Australians who will share their unique gifts and talents to chart a better way for our nation.\n'We will be united by the desire to create stronger families, to foster freedom of speech, to limit the size and scope and reach of government while seeking to rebuild confidence in civil society.\n'We will give hope to those who despair at the current state of Australian politics and who demand a better way for themselves, for their children and for the nation.\n'The journey ahead will not be for the feign of heart, but worth while ventures rarely are and every journey begins with a first step.'\n is pictured at the ecumenical church service to mark the start of the parliamentary year at St Christopher's cathedral in Canberra\nMr Turnbull, his wife Lucy and Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce are pictured on Tuesday\nIn the phone call, Mr Bernardi told Mr Turnbull the 2015 leadership coup against Tony Abbott was a key driving force behind his resignation from the party, Sydney Morning Herald reported.\nHe told the prime minister there were talks to challenge his leadership.\n'There's talk about doing it again and I want no part of it,' Mr Bernardi told Mr Turnbull, colleagues told Fairfax.\nMr Abbott, backbencher and former prime minister, could be seen smiling at a Coalition joint partyroom meeting at Parliament House on Tuesday.\nMr Oakes said the senator had timed his resignation 'to inflict maximum damage' on the prime minister, on the first day of the parliamentary year.\nCory Bernardi shared this selfie posing in a Donald Trump 'Make Australia Great Again' hat last year\nMr Turnbull is pictured delivering a reading during the ecumenical church service to mark the start of the parliamentary year at St Christopher's cathedral in Canberra\nMr Turnbull arrived at the ecumenical service at St Christopher's cathedral in Canberra with his wife Lucy on Tuesday morning and refused to answer questions as he arrived for the service in suburban Canberra.\nInside, he read from Psalm 15: 'Lord, who may dwell in your sacred tent? Who may live on your holy mountain.\n'The one whose walk is blameless, who does what is righteous, who speaks the truth from their heart.'\nPeter Dutton - regarded as the leading conservative inside Mr Turnbull's cabinet - didn't hold back on criticising Mr Bernardi.\n'I think people will be angry about any defection, angry about the betrayal of the Liberal Party values,' the immigration minister told ABC radio.\nMr Abbott, backbencher and former prime minister, could be seen smiling at a Coalition joint partyroom meeting at Parliament House on Tuesday\nIn the phone call, Mr Bernardi told Mr Turnbull the 2015 leadership coup against Tony Abbott (pictured on Tuesday) was a key driving force behind his resignation from the party\nMr Dutton said he didn't believe other coalition MPs would follow Mr Bernardi who is tipped to announce the formation of the Australian Conservatives party when he publicly reveals his future to the Senate later on Tuesday.\nOn Twitter, Defence Minister Christopher Pyne said the 'honourable course' was for Mr Bernardi to resign and recontest as an independent because he was elected as a Liberal.\n'Those most hurt by Cory Bernardi are the hundreds of thousands of SA voters who voted Liberal in the Senate only to be let down by him,' Mr Pyne wrote on Twitter.\n'The Liberal Party's values are not limited to conservatism. We are Liberals because we are open to new ideas; tolerant of difference; ... modern and forward looking; we believe in reward for effort and sharing Australia's good fortune with those in need.'\nLiberal MP Craig Kelly wants Mr Bernardi to think again.\n'You can do a lot more inside the Liberal party, working for, arguing those things that you believe in, than actually outside the tent,' he told the ABC.\nMr Turnbull refused to answer questions as he arrived for the service in suburban Canberra\nMr Bernardi's decision is set to dominate the first day of federal parliament for the year.\nBut cabinet minister Arthur Sinodinos denies it will be a distraction.\n'Not if we and the press focus on what's important to our fellow Australians,' he said.\nFellow coalition MPs, who are usually not willing to talk politics on sacred grounds, were happy to give their two cents worth on Mr Bernardi at the service on Tuesday.\n'He should be honourable and he should resign from the Senate and run as an independent,' Liberal backbencher Jane Prentice said.\nKen Wyatt offered a more charitable view.\n'On principle I'd like to see Cory remain with us but if he's made that decision then I'm not going to begrudge him making that decision,' the minister told reporters.\nMr Turnbull is pictured with a portrait of former prime minister Tony Abbott at a Coalition joint partyroom meeting on Tuesday\nMr Abbott and Immigration Minister Peter Dutton are pictured at the meeting at the Parliament House in Canberra on Tuesday\nTreasurer Scott Morrison was in a reflective mood as he went to pray for the year ahead, turning his mind to South Australian Liberal party members who supported Senator Bernardi at the 2016 election.\n'They're the ones he made the promise to, to be a Liberal,' Mr Morrison said.\nThe traditional display of political unity across the aisle was short-lived, as Labor leader Bill Shorten sought to remind everyone that a government that could not govern itself could not govern the nation.\n'It is long overdue for the government to focus on the jobs of other Australians,' he said as he left the service alongside his wife, Chloe.\nDeputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce did not appear too fussed by the distraction.\nCory Bernardi has called Malcolm Turnbull to confirm he will defect from the Liberal Party (Mr Bernardi pictured in August last year)\n'Everything is always interesting in this job, eh,' he said.\nAnd his advice for Senator Bernardi?\n'Pray. Pray hard.'\nConservative Queensland government backbencher George Christensen said Mr Bernardi had never asked him to leave the Liberal National Party.\n'At this point in time I'm very loyal to Barnaby Joyce - I sit within the National Party - it's a party I've been a member of for more than two decades,' he told ABC radio.\n'I'm going to continue here for as long as the party - and I believe the National Party always will be - in tune with conservative values and in tune with regional electorates.'\nSean Edwards has more reason than most to be angry with his fellow South Australian.\nOn Twitter, Defence Minister Christopher Pyne said the 'honourable course' was for Mr Bernardi to resign and recontest as an independent because he was elected as a Liberal\n'It would be a gross departure as to - certainly six months into a six-year term - what people would have expected,' said the former senator who lost his seat at the 2016 election.\nMr Edwards, who was number five on the SA Senate ticket behind Mr Bernardi running as number two, said he would be disappointed if he left.\n'I would prefer to see Mr Bernardi stay within the Liberal party and do the work that all the members that preselected him in preference to members like myself (expect),' he said.\nChanges to way senators are elected would make it harder for Liberal renegade Cory Bernardi to retain his Senate seat, one crossbencher warned.\nCory Bernardi has been told by one his of soon-to-be fellow crossbenchers he risks losing his Senate seat if he quits the Liberal Party to sit as an independent conservative.\nLiberal Democrat David Leyonhjlem told reporters in Canberra on Tuesday he had a simple message for the renegade government senator: 'Don't do it.'\nChanges to way senators are elected would make his South Australian seat much harder to retain, he warned.\nBut Mr Bernardi would make a good replacement on small-L liberal economic issues after Family First senator Bob Day quit parliament.\nGovernment senator James Paterson said his thoughts were with Liberal voters in South Australia who would be feeling disappointed.\n'I hope if Cory does go to the cross bench that ... he bears in mind he was elected on a Liberal Party platform,' he told reporters.\nSupport for the federal government is at its lowest point since ousted Tony Abbott, Newspoll revealed on monday.\nLabor leads 54 to 46 per cent on a two-party preferred basis, according to the poll published in The Australian newspaper.\nThe survey of more than 1700 people showed the Liberal party's primary vote slipped four points to 35 per cent over the holidays.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/cory-bernardi-warns-malcolm-turnbull-of-fresh-leadership-talk-in-defection-phone-call-20170206-gu6wrr.html", "https://twitter.com/9NewsAUS/status/828713974782779392", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-07T03:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T09:38:50.740+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
