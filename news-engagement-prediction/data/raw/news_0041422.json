ITV \nSadiq Khan has suggested he is open to banning driving in London on certain days in a drastic bid to cut deadly air pollution. \nThe Mayor said “nothing is off the table” when asked whether he would consider a ban on driving as part of his crackdown on toxic air. \nIn an interview on ITV’s Peston on Sunday programme, Mr Khan said tackling air pollution was “a matter of social justice” and around 9,000 Londoners die each year because of poor quality air. \nThe comments come just days after he announced a new £21.50 T-charge for diesel cars to drive into central London during weekdays . Fumes: Traffic pollution in north London earlier this month. (Jeremy Selwyn) \nThe toxicity levy, which would see drivers pay double their current Congestion Charge fee, is expected to hit up to 10,000 vehicles with the worst emissions. \nWhen asked by broadcaster Robert Peston whether he would consider banning some driving on certain days, the Labour mayor said: “Nothing’s off the table. I want to address the issue of poor quality air 365 days a year.” Some Londoners are considering leaving the capital due to air pollution levels \nHe added he wanted to tell the Government they “have to do much, much more”. \nHe said: “You [the Government] need to do a national diesel scrappage fund. We need a Clean Air Act fit for purpose for the 21st century. \n“The government has got to step up to the plate.” \nScientists believe up to 9,400 people in London die from toxic air every year. Revealed: diesel 'T-charge' zone which comes into force from October \nMore than 220 doctors, including at least 100 in the capital, signed a letter to Prime Minister Theresa May last week urging her to begin phasing out diesel vehicles as soon as possible. \nMr Khan was also asked if he felt the decision to move Donald Trump’s proposed state visit to Birmingham instead of the UK capital was a “slap in the face” to London. \nThe mayor said: “I think this ban from the seven Muslim majority countries is cruel and shameful and in these circumstances we shouldn’t be rolling out the red carpet.” More about: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T18:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T13:44:31.210+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
