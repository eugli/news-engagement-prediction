With the XZs, Sony wants to entice consumers which are looking for a top-notch phone that is not in the \"big phablet\" category, so let's see how the specs of this new handset compare to some of its most popular rivals like the Apple iPhone 7 and the Samsung Galaxy S7. First off, it's worth pointing out that the Xperia XZs borrows a lot of features from last year's high-end XZ model. This might disappoint some, as one would expect more from a $699.99 priced 2017 flagship. Still, the Snapdragon 820 system chip and 4 GB of RAM that the XZs sports won't have too much trouble handling even the most intense present-day applications. Although many of its characteristics scream \"2016\", the Xperia XZs does host some interesting modern components. Sony has incorporated its latest 19 MP sensor on the device, which is capable of shooting super slow-motion video at 960 fps. Another nifty addition is the inclusion of dual SIM support, which you won't be able to find on XZs' competitors. So, how does the trio match up? Let's take a look at the specs comparison right below.
