According to The Information, the combined value of the shares sold in the two 2012 funding rounds, worth $US15.2 million at the time, are now roughly $US3.2 billion. (We don’t know which of the two rounds the school invested in.) \nSo what’s a school doing investing in a messaging app that had (at the time) a reputation for sexting? It’s down to one of the fathers of a student at the time — Barry Eggers, founder of another early Snap investor Lightspeed Venture Partners. It was Eggers apparently who got the app on the radar of SF Growth Fund, the private school’s investment fund. \nThe school did not immediately respond to Business Insider’s request for comment, which was sent outside of US business hours. \nOn its website, Saint Francis High School says it “serves Catholic families and all families who wish to experience a Catholic, Holy Cross education. In the Holy Cross tradition, Saint Francis High School serves students with a variety of abilities and backgrounds and unites them into a community where the gifts and talents of each person are appreciated.” It charges $US16,000 a year for tuition. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T03:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T11:48:39.880+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
