These were attacks that Trump claims were either not reported or underreported, but the inclusion of the likes of the Orlando and San Bernardino attacks, which had wall-to-wall, 24/7 coverage for weeks , supports the speculation that it's all about distracting the media from a story that's not going Trump's way. \nDonald Trump claimed incidents, such as the San Bernardino attack, were underreported by the media.

There is sufficient evidence on the public record now for us to appreciate that Donald Trump loves Donald Trump very much, and that this love can only be expressed in big numbers, like those who didn't quite make it to his inauguration. \nTrump wasn't merely upset; he was infuriated by media reports that his inauguration crowd was just a fraction of that which turned out for Barack Obama in 2009; and of that which turned out for the women's protest the day after the Trump inauguration. \nThe president barked at the National Parks Service for tweeting images that showed the big Obama crowd side-by- side with the much lesser crowd for Trump. And Sean Spicer made a right hash of his first outing as presidential spokesman, by following Trump's order that he mount an absurd attack on the media's Shameful, dishonest reporting of the Trump crowd. \nHold that thought as you read Spicer's effort to recast Trump's charge that the media are accomplices to terror – \"He felt members of the media don't always cover some of those [terror] events to the extent that other events might get covered,\" Spicer said. \n\"Protests will get blown out of the water, and yet an attack or a foiled attack doesn't necessarily get the same coverage.\" \nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer pushed Trump's message on the media's reporting on terror attacks.

In all that, a key objective in Trump's diatribe on Monday was to punish the press for, as he sees it, dissing him on his inauguration day. \nAs a former adviser to four US presidents, political analyst David Gergen has been around the traps – and he was astonished by Trump's unfounded attack on the media. \n\"It's beneath the dignity of the presidency,\" he told CNN. \"I think it tears at the fabric of what holds us together as a people, when we can't trust each other, we can't trust the White House, and he's telling us we can't trust the press. This is the way democracies come unravelled.\" \nStrangely there were no attacks in Israel on Trump's list and there was no mention either of non-Islamic attacks, like that of the white supremacist Dylann Roof, who killed nine people in a Charleston, South Carolina church in 2015. \nAll of which prompted this in an editorial in The New York Times : \"There was, in fact, a terrorist attack shortly after Mr. Trump issued his immigration order: a white supremacist, officials say, armed himself with an assault rifle and stormed a mosque in Quebec City, slaughtering six Muslims during their prayers. Mr. Trump has not said a word about that massacre — although he was quick to tell America on Twitter to \"get smart\" when, a few days later, an Egyptian man wielding a knife attacked a military patrol in Paris, injuring one soldier.\" \nTrump sees terrorism only as perpetrated by Muslims - and all Muslims are complicit. \nAnd attacks in which the victims are Muslims don't seem to rate. Barely mentioned on the Trump list were countries most affects by terrorism from Islamist extremists. \nAccording to the State Department, nearly three quarters of all deaths from terrorist attacks in 2015 happened in five countries — Afghanistan, Iraq, Nigeria, Pakistan and Syria, according to the State Department. The White House list was silent on attacks in Iraq, Nigeria and Syria. And two others were cited just once — a knife attack in Pakistan in which an American citizen was wounded; and a suicide bombing in Afghanistan in which 14 Nepali security guards died. \nIn terms of Muslim victims, analysts suggest as many as 95 per cent are Muslims, though they caution that reports on attacks don't dwell on the beliefs of victims. \nThe Global Terrorism Database, as reported by the Voice of America , says most attacks, as many as 98 per cent between 2001 and 2015, were executed beyond the US and Western Europe, contrary to the impression conveyed by the White House's list and the administration's rhetoric. \nBy the count of The Washington Post , attacks in the Middle East, Africa and Asia accounted for \"nearly 50 times more deaths from terrorism than Europe and the Americas\" in the 18 months from early 2015. The Post reports that 658 people were killed in 46 attacks in Europe and the Americas, compared 28,031 deaths in 2063 attacks elsewhere in the world. \nThe deadliest attacks in the Post analysis were 292 killed in a suicide bombing in Baghdad, 208 killed in a tribal attack in Ethiopia and 224 killed in the bombing of a Russian aircraft – with only the airline crash getting a mention on the White House list. \nThere's logic in the speculation that Trump took his charge against the media from InfoWars.com – that's where he gets many of his conspiracy theories. Trump has actually been on-air with InfoWars founder Alex Jones. \nDonald Trump has previously appeared on-air with InfoWars founder Alex Jones.

A year into office, you'll be saying, \"Wow, I remember that interview. He said he was going to do it, and he did a great job.\" \nAnd here's a selection of InfoWars headlines on the media and terror: \"FAKE NEWS: MAINSTREAM MEDIA WHITEWASHES ISLAMIC TERROR IN BERLIN: Propagandists desperate to hide the obvious\" - December 20 \"SCANDAL: MASS MEDIA COVERS UP TERRORISM TO PROTECT ISLAM\" - July 29 \"GERMANY COVERING UP TERROR PLOTS TO PROTECT MUSLIM MIGRANTS\" - June 24 \"MEDIA CAUGHT COVERING UP ISLAMIC TIES IN MUNICH ATTACK\" - July 24 \"VIDEO: TERROR IN GERMANY – THE TRUTH THEY HIDE: Mass media deception to conceal what's really happening\" - July 25 \nSimilarly, InfoWars was in on the ground-floor with other crazy stuff – the nonsense theory of millions of illegal votes; the birther conspiracy against Obama; the \"lock her up\" campaign against Hillary Clinton; and the Muslim masses in the US celebrating the September 11 attacks. \nFor a president who casts himself as the font of all truth, attacks like those that he mounts on the courts and the media also serve to discredit or delegitimise conventional sources of truth, despite their flaws and failings. If they are knocked down as a check on the truthiness of the president, then he can get away with any load of old cobblers. \nSo what you have is a White House team that spent its first day in office running in circles to prove the impossible – that Trump's inauguration crowd was bigger than Barack Obama's. \nAnd since and before the September 11 attacks, the world's media has reported relentlessly on terrorism, with dozens of journalists dying in the process, but this White House does circles again, producing a nonsense list which it claims proves a nitwit conspiracy theory that a complicit global media is under-reporting or not reporting terrorism. \nThis kind of stuff can't be simply reported as \"the president says…\" \n\"We had a wonderful election, didn't we?\" Mr Trump told the military brass at Central Command. \"I saw those numbers, and you liked me, and I liked you.\" \nSeriously, has any other US president uttered such inanities?
