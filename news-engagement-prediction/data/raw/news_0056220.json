Photo: Egg is 14 weeks old and many people rallied together to help find the pug. (Facebook: NSW Police) \nThe man even gave very detailed descriptions of the alleged assailants as being of Mediterranean or Middle Eastern appearance and in their 30s. \nAt the time of the alleged dognapping, police said the owner was \"extremely distraught\" and could not face media. \nThrough their investigations, which involved looking at CCTV in the area, police found the story did not stack up. \nLast night they issued the owner with a notice to appear in court for making a false representation resulting in police investigation. \nA NSW police spokeswoman told the ABC she could not imagine why someone would invent such a tale. \nMany people banded together to find Egg, even creating a 'Help find kidnapped Egg the Pug' Facebook page to provide updates. \nThe whereabouts of Egg is still unknown and police still want people to keep an eye out for the puppy and report any information to Crime Stoppers. \nThe owner will appear in Burwood Local Court on April 6.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:45:20.646+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
