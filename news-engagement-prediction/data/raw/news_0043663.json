It didn’t look good. He had a wife and two children, 12 and 13 years old. He wasn’t yet 50.\n“You wonder if you going to get through, or for how long,” he said. “But my wife and my family have been supportive all through this. And they are now. They know that what I’m doing means a lot to me.”\nRehnke teaches cancer prevention courses and does other work for the Firefighter Cancer Support Network.\nHe not only works to make individual firefighters and their departments more aware of the dangers they face and the methods for fighting them, but he’s also there to support the inordinate number of firefighters who fall victim to all sorts of cancer.\nTo that extent, he recently got involved in trying to convince the Arizona Legislature to pass two bills – House Bill 2410 and HB 2161 -- that would add a number of cancers, as well as heart disease, to the current list of occupational diseases that would qualify firefighters for workers’ compensation.\nDangers linger long after the fire “Firefighting, like a lot of occupations, has long-held traditions,” he told me. “But not all of them are safe, you find out. I try to bring to light that the way we did business in the past may sometimes put us at increased risk. One of the reasons is that what is burning now is very different from what was burning 30 or 40 or 50 years ago. We’ve also learned a lot about exposure to all kinds of chemicals, even some of those we thought were our friends but are not. And we’ve learned a lot about exposure to smoke. How it can literally penetrate you.”\nPolitics isn’t something he expected to be involved with.\nHe was interested in the fire service. It’s all he wanted to do. It’s what he loved. Now, he speaks out about cancer danger, he’s done video , he’s testified before elected officials, he does whatever he can to protect others on the job. And he wants to make sure politicians understand that firefighters aren’t looking for any special treatment.\n“I think we’re a pretty fact-based group,” he said. “It’s not like we were lackadaisical or that people were violating any safety policy. It’s just that we are continually learning about the long-term ramifications of the different things we come into contact with. So far, the feedback I’ve been getting (from politicians) has been pretty positive.”\nNews from the doctors hasn’t been quite as good. His cancer is at stage four.\n“I had a short span of remission after my original diagnosis,” Rehnke told me. “But then the cancer came back and forced me to retire. I’m hanging in there. It’s the only option I’ve got. I’ve gotten through six years and I’m grateful for that. I still get out when I can to do the courses. If we can prevent even one other firefighter from going through this it would be worth it. My family has been great. They know how important this is to me. It takes its toll, but it’s worth it.”\nTechnically, Rehnke is no longer employed in the life-saving business.\nJust as technically, however, he is still saving lives.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T05:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T08:47:40.932+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
