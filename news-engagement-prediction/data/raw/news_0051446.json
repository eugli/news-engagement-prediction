Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nDesperate Paul Nuttall has spent three hours giving a witness statement to the Hillsborough police inquiry as he tries to regain voters’ shattered trust. \nThe UKIP leader – dubbed the ‘Purple Pinocchio’ after a string of false claims – told a BBC Radio 5 Live hustings he spent three hours giving a witness statement to Operation Resolve this week. \nHe also finally condemned UKIP mega-donor Arron Banks - a full week after he said he was \"sick to death\" of hearing about the stadium disaster, people were \"milking it\" and \"accidents happen\". \nLast week Nigel Farage refused to disown \"good friend\" Mr Banks' comments and said he was \"entitled to his own views\".

The UKIP leader ducked questions on the row after a tearful speech last week (Photo: REUTERS) \nHe revealed he will not quit as leader even if he loses to Labour. \nMr Nuttall hopes that by putting his experience on record, he can dispel \"smears\" that he lied about being at Hillsborough when 96 fans died. \nBut he admitted he was “negligent” in allowing false claims onto his website that close friends died in the tragedy. \nAnd yesterday his own party's branch chairman in Liverpool quit over the party's handling of the row. \nMr Nuttall said: \"I hold my hands up. I didn't check something that went up on my website. I didn't write it. \n\"But it's my responsibility, it's my website, I should have checked it. \n\"However it is part of a wider smear campaign which started last Friday, whereby there was a claim in a newspaper that I wasn't actually at the Hillsborough disaster – even though I provided witness statements that I was there, even though I spent three hours yesterday morning in Operation Resolve giving a witness statement.\" Claims Mr Nuttall lost \"close personal friends\" in the disaster were false (Photo: PA) \nHe added: \"Look, I got it wrong. But I want to put this is perspective, right?. I didn't check something that went up on my website. \n\"It's not as if I've taken illegally from the public purse. It's not as if I've said something racist. It's not as if I've sent people to war illegally.\" \nAnd he said: \"Of course I'll apologise to the people of Liverpool.\" \nLast week Mr Nuttall ducked questions about Mr Banks' comments. \nToday, a full week after they were made, he said: \"I wasn't over the moon, put it that way. I wasn't happy. It wasn't fair, it wasn't right. Ukip's donor Arron Banks claimed he was \"sick to death\" of hearing about Hillsborough (Photo: PA) \n\"That certainly isn't the feeling in Liverpool. And I condemn absolutely what he said.\" \nBut he added: \"I haven't spoken to him. Arron Banks isn't a member of UKIP. I can't kick him out of an organisation that he doesn't belong to.\" \nAnd he dismissed questions of whether he should quit if he fails to overturn Labour's 2,500 majority in Stoke-on-Trent Central. \n\"It will only be 12 weeks into my leadership at the end of this by-election,\" he said. \n\"What we've got here is a long-term project going forward.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:27:56.890+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
