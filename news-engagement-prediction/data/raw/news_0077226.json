Who’ll give her a hug when I’m not here?” \nToday, our sister paper the Daily Record backs Alison’s battle and her plea to not put a price on life. \nAlison knows she will probably require effective-but-expensive drug Kadcyla to extend her life but it is currently not available on the NHS other than by individual patient treatment requests – and only a handful of women have successfully been approved under this scheme.

I waited until I had my next period but the lump was still there but not quite as painful. \n“I went to my GP and saw a locum, who said that although he could feel the lump, he didn’t think it was anything sinister. He told me to come back at a different time during my menstrual cycle to check it again. \n“I made an appointment two days after I returned from holiday and saw my regular GP. She seemed really concerned and got me an emergency referral at the breast clinic.” Read More Biopsies and scans revealed Alison had breast cancer which had spread to her liver (Photo: Getty) \nBiopsies and scans revealed she had breast cancer which had spread to her liver. \nAlison said: “I was aware afterwards the consultant had said it was ‘treatable’ and not curable.” \nShe began chemotherapy but her first dose made her so ill that the strength was reduced for the remaining doses. Later this week, she will have her ninth dose, which she hopes will be her last. \nFor at least a week after her treatment, Alison is desperately ill. \nShe said: “The Monday after chemo feels like the end of the world but by Friday, I’m back on my feet. \n“The chemo makes you really fatigued and you’re staring at the same four walls for days until you are well enough again. Even then, you have no energy and no desire to engage with people. \n“It is hard not to feel resentful of people going about their daily business. The effort to be normal is sometimes overwhelming.” \nAlison’s hair has begun to thin again after a period of regrowth. \nShe said: “Ellen said to me recently, ‘I can still see it’s the same person in your eyes’ but she misses the person I was – coming in from work in my dress and with my hair quite long. It is hard for her seeing someone different.” Read More Childhood sweethearts fight for more time together after brain tumour shock just a year since reunion Alison is fighting to have the drug made available on the NHS (Photo: Getty) \nAlison is currently on Herceptin and Pertuzumab and while the former is available on the NHS, she has only been able to access the latter because of her private medical insurance. \nHer insurers have agreed to fund it for a year but after that Alison will have to find £3000 to pay for it herself or hope her health board agree to pick up the tab. Ultimately, Alison believes she will need Kadcyla. \nShe said: “I know it is a treatment for HER2+ and I’m very interested in it. It’s currently under review in England and Wales, and I know it will be a treatment option one day. To know it is available would give me a sense of relief, knowing there is more of a future for me. \n“It would enable me to live a bit more and be able to support people around me a little bit better. I know nothing is a sure thing but it would give me a bit more hope. \n“Being there for Ellen is everything. There is just the two of us. Her dad and I split up when she was about 14 months old and he lives in Australia.” Alison wants to see Ellen grow up (Photo: Daily Record, George McLuskie) \nShe added: “One of the first things Ellen said when we were with the breast support nurses was, ‘You might not be at my wedding’. \n“The other thing was, ‘Everybody that I love leaves me’. That was hard to hear. \n“The age she is at and going through her exams it’s a terrible time for this to have happened – not that there is ever a good time. \n“There is so much going to be happening within a relatively short time for her – leaving school, going to university and finding a job in whatever she decides to do. \n“There are a lot of big milestones for her and I don’t want her to be doing them on her own. It upsets me whenever I say it. \n“There are things I want to celebrate with her, to give her a hug when things don’t go so well and I don’t know who she is going to have for that. Who will give her a hug and tell her everything will be ok if I’m not here. \n“I’m a single parent and if I’m not here, Ellen will be on her own. I don’t know how she’ll cope. I’ve been the only constant in her life. \n“It is one thing imagining her dealing with that in her mid-20s but thinking about that for her now breaks my heart.” \nAlison appealed to the SMC: “It’s not just about the patient, it’s about their families. If there are targeted therapies available, there must have been a demand for them so to withhold them seems wrong. \n“I don’t value my life over anyone else’s but women like us have dependents. The hoops some people have had to jump through is terrible. I just don’t know how the SMC can say, ‘No’. \n“They are not only saying, ‘No’ to me but also to Ellen and my mum and dad, too.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T14:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T09:58:55.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
