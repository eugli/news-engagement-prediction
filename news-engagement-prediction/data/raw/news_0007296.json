Since May had promised she would speak frankly with Trump when meeting him last Friday, what happened? \nMay retorted the given the number of resignations Corbyn has had from his frontbench, many of his MPs will have read Dalyell’s book. She continued that her meeting with Trump enabled her to build on the UK’s relationship with its most important ally, and crucial among her aims was to secure Trump’s 100% commitment to Nato. \nCorbyn then pressed May over reports that she had received advance warning by the White House that the executive order on travel was imminent. May replied that everyone had advance notice on Trump’s intentions, since they were clearly stated in his presidential campaign. “The question is how to respond. The job of government is not to chase the headlines, or to take the streets in protest, it’s to protect the interests of British citizens and that’s exactly what we did.” \nAlluding to Neville Chamberlain, Corbyn said he had written to May on the issue and “I hold in my hand her piece of paper”, and that it contained no condemnation of Trump, or reference to the Geneva convention’s pledge to admit refugees regardless of race, religion or country of origin. May said Britain could be proud of its support for refugees. \nCorbyn followed up by saying that in her eagerness to strike a trade deal with Trump May had not ruled out the prospect of opening up the NHS to private American healthcare companies. May said she could give a detailed answer, but the question deserved a straightforward reply: “The NHS is not for sale and it never will be.” \nCorbyn concluded by running down Trump’s praise for torture, incitement of hatred against minorities and attacks on women’s rights, before asking May what more he had to do before she would listen to the 1.8 million people who signed the petition for his state visit to the UK to be withdrawn . \nTo cheers, May replied that since Labour foreign policy was to “object to and insult the democratically elected head of state of our most important ally”, he would not have been able to protect British citizens affected by the travel ban, secure a trade deal or get a commitment to Nato. “He can lead a protest, I’m leading a country.” Snap verdict \nStrong and effective performances from Corbyn and May. Corbyn started with a superb, short zinger, and for the first four questions of the exchanges, as he quizzed May over Trump, he clearly had the upper hand. He asked a good question on the NHS and a UK-US trade deal too, but May was about to knock this back with a reply that was convincing rhetorically, if not necessarily technically and legally. (What on earth does “the NHS is not for sale” actually mean?) May only really got the upper hand with her final answer, when she powerfully accused Corbyn of leftish grandstanding and of being unable to accept the realpolitik necessity of maintaining cordial relations with someone like Trump. This is key to how she sees herself, while Corbyn rates ideological integrity much more. Both of them will be pleased with how PMQs turned out.
