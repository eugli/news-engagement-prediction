That's not good news for the rest of the season but the likes of Liverpool can eye up their transfers for the summer. \nJurgen Klopp would have had some strong hopes for his team going into this summer and early on it looked like he would have been right. \nEven at the turn of the year things were going pretty well but a terrible start to 2017 has seen them win just one game and get knocked out of the EFL and FA Cups. \nOne of the contributing factors was the loss of Saido Mane to the African Cup of Nations and that has highlighted the need for better strength in depth at Anfield. \nSo it's no surprise that Jurgen Klopp is looking at attacking players but somewhat more surprising that Calcio Mercato are reporting that the Reds have already held talks with Middlesbrough over the signing of Gaston Ramirez. \nThe 26 year old attacking midfielder recently handed in a transfer request towards the end of the January transfer window. \nThat was after Leicester City showed interest towards the Uruguayan and tried to sign him. However Aitor Karanka rejected the request and Ramirez is back into the squad. \nRamirez has made 14 starts in the league for Boro so far this season and has scored two goals and set up two for his teammates. \nPreviously Ramirez had trouble at former club Southampton and was desperate to make a move to the Riverside Stadium where he helped them gain promotion to the Premier League. \nEarly reaction by some Liverpool fans suggests it wouldn't be the most popular move for the Anfield club to make: Joe Heart throws to Chilwell, plays it into Gaston Ramirez who slots Troy deeney through straight on goal nd liverpool stay 15th - moneyball fc (@JOZ9T9) February 9, 2017 Went from being linked to Aubameyang to Gaston Ramirez.
