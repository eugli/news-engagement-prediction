(Photo: George Widman, AP) 4 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nMajor League Baseball and its players’ association officially killed the intentional walk as we know it on Wednesday. \nThe union agreed to MLB’s request to empower managers to order an intentional walk via a signal from the dugout, the least-intrusive of several initiatives to speed up the pace of play that Commissioner Rob Manfred seems intent on implementing. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred: Union may have no say in 2018 rules changes \n\"As part of a broader discussion with other moving pieces, the answer is yes,\" MLBPA executive director Tony Clark wrote Wednesday in an email to The Associated Press. \"There are details, as part of that discussion, that are still being worked through, however.\" \nThe agreement comes in the wake of a series of news conferences held by Manfred and Clark, the final one coming Tuesday when the commissioner expressed anger at Clark’s indifference to his pace-of-play initiatives, and said he planned to utilize a unilateral implementation of the rules – including a possible pitch clock – in 2018. \nClark certainly took exception to Manfred’s comments and said rule changes already are expected to be implemented this season. There are plans for a two-minute limit this year for instant replay reviews. And there will be pace of game warnings and fines. \nThe rancor comes less than three months after MLB and the union ratified a five-year extension of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. The first victim will be the intentional pass, a four-pitch process that on the surface seems redundant, but also a part of the game’s fabric that ardent fans find endearing. \nHowever, Manfred has expressed overriding concerns about the game’s growth and its ability to appeal to the casual fan. Pace of play seems to be his avenue to expanding appeal. Last year, the average time of a nine-inning game again hit the 3-hour mark.
