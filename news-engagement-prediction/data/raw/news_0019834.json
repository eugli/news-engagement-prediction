Spurs have lost 15 of their 24 visits to Anfield in the Premier League (W2 D7) – they have only lost more often at Old Trafford (20) and Stamford Bridge (16). Mauricio Pochettino has never beaten the Reds as Spurs manager (D3 L3), including losing a League Cup fourth round tie earlier this season. However, when he was manager of Southampton he won two of three games (L1) against them. Only against Newcastle (88) have Liverpool scored more Premier League goals than against Spurs (83). There have been nine own goals in Premier League meetings between these sides – more than in any other Premier League fixture. Tottenham Hotspur haven't won at Liverpool since Rafael van der Vaart (left) was on the scoresheet in a May 2011 2-0 victory at Anfield Liverpool have scored 12 penalties against Spurs in the Premier League – the most by a team against an opponent in the history of the competition. The Reds have scored more penalties than any other Premier League side this season (6), with all six converted by James Milner. Liverpool have won just one of their 10 games in all competitions in 2017; this is their worst start to a calendar year since 1993, when they mustered just one win in their opening 11 matches. Spurs have conceded the fewest goals from open play in the Premier League this season (7). Indeed, Liverpool have shipped more goals from open play (18) than Spurs have in total this season (16). Harry Kane has been involved in all three of Spurs’ goals in their last two Premier League games at Anfield, scoring twice and assisting once. No player has more Premier League goals in 2017 than Harry Kane (6 - level with Romelu Lukaku). He is the only player to score 20-plus Premier League goals in the last two calendar years (27 in 2015, 22 in 2016). Four of Spurs’ last five away Premier League wins have seen them score four goals, most recently a 4-1 win at Watford on New Years’ Day. However, they’ve never scored more than three goals in a game at Anfield. Jurgen Klopp has an identical record to Brendan Rodgers in his opening 54 Premier League games as Liverpool boss (W26 D16 L12).
