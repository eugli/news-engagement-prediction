The contract is pending a team physical. \nWieters, who could make up to $21 million according to MLB Network's Ken Rosenthal, will reportedly make $10 million in 2017 and has an $11 million opt-out for the following season. The Baltimore Orioles have not yet confirmed the transaction. \nWieters -- whose unsigned stature so late in spring was puzzling -- spent the previous eight seasons with Baltimore, which took him with their first-round choice in the 2007 Draft. The backstop could have hit free agency for the first time last season, but instead opted to accept the Orioles' one-year $15.8 million qualifying offer for 2016.

He later underwent season-ending Tommy John surgery. He played in 75 games in '15 and completed his comeback last season, playing in 124 games and posting a .243/.302/.409 slash line. \nHe hit 117 career homers with Baltimore and, while O's fans clamored for a return, Baltimore instead signed free agent Welington Castillo in mid-December. Castillo, who also has a two-year deal that includes an opt-out in the second year, will make a guaranteed $13 million if he opts into the second year. has covered the Orioles for MLB.com since 2010.
