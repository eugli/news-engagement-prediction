Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nChelsea are planning to hijack Real Madrid’s £75million summer swoop for Sergio Aguero , with the Argentinian star not prepared to be a second-choice striker at Manchester City . \nEuropean champions Real have held a long-term interest in prolific Aguero and are on red alert now the explosive arrival of 19-year-old Brazilian Gabriel Jesus has clouded the Argentinian’s future. \nBut Chelsea would also be major bidders if Aguero decides his career at the Etihad has run its course next summer. \nManager Antonio Conte and his runaway Premier League leaders are still unclear whether 28-year-old top scorer Diego Costa sees his future at Stamford Bridge.

He ended up staying in January, but this could still be Costa's final season at Chelsea (Photo: Getty) \nThat was negotiated to protect the club’s interests more than Aguero’s, although he was happy to put pen to paper. \nSince then, though, he’s been at odds with new boss Pep Guardiola over the role that’s expected of him in the new regime. \nThat has alerted Real Madrid, with sources close to the Spanish giants claiming Aguero is high on their summer wish-list. \nAguero shot to fame across the Spanish capital at Atletico Madrid, where he scored 101 goals in 234 games in five seasons after moving from Argentinian side Independiente.

(Photo: AFP/Getty) ...and the rumblings are louder since the arrival of young Gabriel Jesus (Photo: Kent Gavin/Daily Mirror) \nHe has bettered that ratio at City, with a record of 154 goals in 233 matches since his £38million transfer in 2011. \nAlthough the striker is on record saying he would like to play in Argentina once his contract is over at City, that was before his future at the Etihad became more complicated. \nCity will be in no rush to sell Aguero, but Guardiola’s power at the club means it’s now he who decides who he wants or doesn’t. \nAnd if he favours Jesus over Aguero in the remaining months of the season, that could open the door for a summer exit. poll loading Will Sergio Aguero be a Manchester City player when the summer transfer window closes? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T00:55:26.237+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
