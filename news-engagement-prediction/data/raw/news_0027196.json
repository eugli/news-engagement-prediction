Faith Hill and Tim McGraw Tease New Details About Their Upcoming Joint Tour at the 2017 Grammys By \nFaith Hill and Tim McGraw are gearing up to hit the road! \nBut before they embark on their upcoming Soul2Soul tour later this year, country music's hottest couple caught up with E! News' Ryan Seacrest on the 2017 Grammys red carpet. \nAs for what longtime fans can expect from Faith and Tim's incredible concert experience, the lovebirds played pretty coyâ€”though it seems the pair is definitely hard at work. McGraw explained,\"We're in a mind bender right now because we've been rehearsing, the band's been rehearsing and working on a set list.\" \nThe country crooner admitted creating a set list is the \"toughest thing\" to complete when curating the perfect performance, and Faith couldn't help but agree. \n\"Imagine working on a set list with this guy alone!\" Hill gushed of her hubby of nearly two decades. \"If it was just him, without me included, he's had like 50, 60-something No. 1 records. Honestly, I could just be in the audience.\" Photos \nGrammys 2017 Red Carpet Arrivals \nIt's not like Tim is in poor company! Faith has five Grammy awards of her own, not to mention she's sold more than 40 million albums across her decades-spanning career. When it comes to McGraw, his hit single \"Humble and Kind\" just won the 2017 Grammy Award for Best Country Song. \nThe 49-year-old edged out Keith Urban , Maren Morris , Thomas Rhett and Miranda Lambert for the coveted honor. \nBack on tour talk, Tim also dished, \"It's been 10 years since we've been on the road together doing a tour so we're pretty excited about presenting some new stuff and some of the old stuff in a different way, which is fun.\" \nEnjoy the evening, you two!
