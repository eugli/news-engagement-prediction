The pair is now heading east to complete the cross-country journey, ending in St. John’s in about two months. \nDuring the trek across Canada, Mavriik says he’s been greeted by people in the cities and towns he travels through. \n“I have been greeted… by people that have come out to say, ‘thank you, I would like to offer you a shower, offer you a room,'” Mavriik told Global News. \nHowever, the journey has not been easy. Mavriik said he and Nymeria have slept outside in the cold, often next to the highway where they’ve walked for days. \nREAD MORE: Ontario youth with mental illness waiting months for help, auditor general finds \nBut he says the struggle they face isn’t the same as what some youth and their families can go through when living with mental illness. \n“The siblings, the family members… I mean, imagine a brother and a sister, imagine what their life is like, their life suffers in everything too.” \nWhile never formally diagnosed, Mavriik said he has his own connection to mental illness. \n“One thing I’ve never been able to handle, and that is what was really hard for me in school, is routine and the monotony of the routine,” he said. \nREAD MORE: More Canadian kids visiting ERs for mental health issues: report \nMavriik’s journey is something New Brunswick youth therapist Jason Jones supports. \nAccording to Jones, more young people are hospitalized for mental health issues in New Brunswick than anywhere else in the country, so it can be helpful when anyone raises awareness for such an important cause. \n“I think for a long time the focus has been adult mental health issues and more and more recently we’ve seen that youth suffer from these issues too,” said Jones, who works at the Atlantic Wellness Centre in Riverview, N.B. \nAt the completion of his journey, Mavriik said he plans to write a book about the adventure which, in addition to being a walk for the kids, has also been a healing one for himself. \n“It’s probably, hopefully, a cure for my own mental health.” © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
