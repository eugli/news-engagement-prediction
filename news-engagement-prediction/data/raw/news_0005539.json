(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) On Tuesday morning, the “war room” at the progressive group American Bridge was working away at opposition research on President Trump’s cabinet nominees. Stephen Mnuchin, Trump’s pick for Treasury, had been damaged by a Columbus Dispatch investigation into how, despite denials, his OneWest Bank frequently used “robo-signers” in foreclosure cases. Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), the nominee to run Health and Human Services, was dinged by the latest Wall Street Journal story into his stocks.\nBoth were expected to be moved ahead in Senate committees Tuesday. But as the “war room” watched from afar, Republican committee leaders angrily reported that Democrats had boycotted the mark-ups, delaying the votes. The researchers burst into cheers.\n[ Democrats boycott confirmation hearings for Price and Mnuchin, blocking votes ] \nTuesday’s delays, which are unlikely to stop final confirmation votes for Trump’s nominees, were welcomed by a left that had become increasingly angry about the Senate Democrats’ strategy. They were especially potent on a day that will end with the president nominating his pick for a Supreme Court seat, one that progressives consider stolen from former president Barack Obama.\n“I certainly applaud the Democrats who stood up and performed their advice and consent responsibilities in an admirable fashion,” said Nan Aron, the founder of the Alliance for Justice, which is gearing up a campaign to stop Trump’s court pick. “We’ve seen the Republicans intent on rubber-stamping Trump cabinet appointees as quickly as possible to avoid public scrutiny. Around our office, people were thrilled to see the Democrats standing up.”\nThe Senate Democrats’ move scratched the same itch that House conservatives had eight years earlier, when they surprised the majority by denying even a single vote to the 2009 stimulus package. Then-Minority Whip Eric Cantor celebrated that vote with a video set to Aerosmith’s “Back in the Saddle,” a message to the party’s disgruntled base that Republicans would fight whatever they could. Then, Republicans had gotten even moderate members to vote no; on Tuesday, even Finance Committee members from states won by Trump joined the boycott.\nStill, there was little 2009-style triumphalism from Democrats on Tuesday morning. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), one of the plotters behind the committee boycott, said in an interview that he had worked phones until 11 p.m. Monday before the plan cohered. But on Tuesday, swarmed by reporters, he pushed back on the idea that Democrats had a new opposition strategy.\n“You guys are all assuming this is delay, and tactics, and politics,” said Brown. “They lied to the committee. You can write your story however you want, but they lied to the committee about things that affect peoples’ lives in a direct way. We’re just saying, bring ’em back in, let them explain themselves.”\nBut to the left, the delays represent the first real effort by Democrats to trip up Trump and Republicans. Activists celebrated as Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn denounced the “hissy fit” and Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch called the effort “stupid.” It mirrored what they’d watched Democrats do for eight years, sputtering in the vain hope that voters would punish Republicans.\n“I think it’s a good move, hopefully foreshadowing a far more assertive role for congressional Democrats going forward,” said Norman Solomon, a left-wing writer and activist who now leads the progressive Bernie Delegates Network of 2016 primary veterans. “If they act like doormats, they’ll keep getting rolled — and the country will descend further into a pit of dominant intimidation from Trump and his wrecking crew.”\nSince Jan. 20, Democrats who had enjoyed strong relationships with their base, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), had been surprised by protests at their votes for Trump nominees. The court fight, coupled with Monday night’s firing of the acting attorney general who refused to defend the administration’s executive orders, were becoming rationales to oppose everything Trump did.\n“Republicans have broken all kind of norms in their pursuit of power and we must check them,” said Rep. Ruben Gallego (R-Ariz.) in a Tuesday afternoon statement. “By blockading an accomplished, centrist jurist in Merrick Garland, Senate Republicans disregarded the norms that sustain American democracy. But instead of invoking the so-called ‘nuclear option’ or making a recess appointment to the court, Democrats dithered while Republican won a major victory.”\nBut Gallego would have no say in the court fight; Senate Democrats who would, generally, were cautious about how they described it. The 11-month blockade of Garland’s nomination had led to some confusion in how Democrats ranked their responses to a Trump pick. There had been attaboys from the left after a Politico story about how Democrats would filibuster the pick; there had been rage when CNN reported that Democrats were cracking.\n[ On the death of the Senate and its long history as the world’s greatest deliberative body ] \nBy Tuesday afternoon, what was clear was that Democrats would frame their opposition to a Trump pick as more considered than Republican opposition to Garland. After some criticism for saying she wanted hearings and votes on the nominee, Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) clarified that the “votes” she was referring to were cloture votes — i.e., that she supported a 60-vote threshold for any nominee. (“No hearings, no votes” was a slogan for the Garland impasse, made real by Senate Republicans.)\n“Why would anyone think that because I support confirmation hearing and [a] 60-vote threshold for Supreme Court nominee, that means I’m folding to Trump?” McCaskill asked on Twitter.\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) told reporters Tuesday that he would consider any Trump nominee “based on the merits,” which was hardly as volcanic as the language from the left. But when he clarified what that meant, he opened the door to a four-year filibuster.\n“One of the unfortunate consequences of the Garland obstructionism has been to show that, in fact, the Supreme Court can function with eight members,” said Blumenthal.\nBlumenthal’s colleague, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), was less cryptic about his willingness to stop Trump nominees.\n“What happened today is exceptional,” Murphy said of the committee vote boycott. “I think we are rising to what is a truly exceptional moment. We don’t have 50 votes; there’s only so much to do. But I am prepared to shatter precedents to make it clear we are not going to stand for what Trump is doing.”\nNone of those plans had been clear on Monday night, when Democrats rallied with supporters outside the Supreme Court. At 9 p.m. Tuesday, a coalition of liberal groups, from the Alliance for Justice to MoveOn, will hold their own rally with a more direct theme.\n“This Administration has already shown how dangerous it is, taking fundamentally unconstitutional actions within the first 10 days,” the organizers wrote to supporters. “We need to be ready to immediately raise our voices in opposition and call on senators to reject Trump’s nominee.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:20:15.292+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
