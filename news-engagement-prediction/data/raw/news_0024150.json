Tamir Kalifa for The New York Times Here in the southernmost point on the border with Mexico, the fence serves as the backdrop of everyday life. It forms the back of bus stops and cuts alongside schools and an old golf course. One day in this city of 180,000, two horses grazed in a rural area while tied to the fence’s steel beams – with the border fence as a hitching post. Tony Zavaleta, a Brownsville community leader, stands on land that belonged to his family before the government took a portion of it to build the fence. Tamir Kalifa for The New York Times Tony Zavaleta Brownsville, Tex. The fact that the construction and the investment of billions of dollars is going to begin again is almost laughable. Tony Zavaleta, 69, drove his pick-up truck here on a dirt road. He stopped and looked out toward an empty spit of overgrown brush and trees, with a border fence – a line of vertical spikes atop a solid concrete base. This used to be his late father’s land, until the federal government seized it to build the fence during the Bush administration. His family was paid $3,500 for roughly three acres. “They put the border wall right through the middle of it,” he said. “The federal government didn’t ask me. They could have made a call, sent a letter. No, they just sued us. It’s not a good feeling.” Mr. Zavaleta is opposed to Mr. Trump’s wall. “The fact that the construction and the investment of billions of dollars is going to begin again is almost laughable,” he said, adding that he preferred the current transparent fencing to any potential solid wall. “When you have a solid wall, there’s no question that you have the feeling of being boxed-in.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T19:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T14:32:27.737+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
