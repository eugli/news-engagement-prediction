Photo: Luke Sharrett/Getty Images It is not clear whether it’s a trial balloon, a diversionary gesture, or a sign of things to come, but Politico has gotten hold of a “discussion draft” of House provisions repealing (on a staggered timetable) and partially replacing Obamacare, a chore Congress must take on sooner rather than later as part of a budget plan put into motion a week before Donald Trump took office.\nHere’s Politico ’s own summary of its find:\nThe legislation would take down the foundation of Obamacare, including the unpopular individual mandate, subsidies based on people’s income, and all of the law’s taxes. It would significantly roll back Medicaid spending and give states money to create high-risk pools for some people with preexisting conditions. Some elements would be effective right away; others not until 2020. The leaked draft was dated February 10, so it may have already been superseded. But it is more detailed than previous publicly available material on what Republicans were up to.\nMuch of what is in the draft reflects immediate changes in the Affordable Care Act that have long been expected: substitution of an incentive for “continuous coverage” for Obamacare’s purchasing mandate, and money for states to set up “high-risk pools” to help the otherwise uninsurable. As Sarah Cliff points out in her take on the draft, there’s a lot more money for high-risk pools, and steeper penalties for letting coverage lapse, than in past GOP schemes. A ban on the use of federal funds by abortion providers like Planned Parenthood would apparently take effect immediately, too.\nMany of the other provisions would be phased in or delayed until the beginning of 2020. Those include the elimination of Obamacare’s minimum benefit package; cancellation of the higher federal dollar match offered in the ACA for expanding Medicaid; and replacement of Obamacare’s means-tested purchasing subsidies with new tax credits ranging in value strictly based on age, which is treated as an acceptable indicator of health needs. Also repealed is Obamacare’s limits on insurance company price discrimination against old folks. So when it’s all phased in, older people not yet eligible for Medicare could face sharply higher premiums, but receive some tax subsidies not limited by their own incomes.\nThe Medicaid provisions are very complicated, but it looks like states that expanded Medicaid under ACA will have until 2020 to keep their higher federal-match payments — but then they are gone. And then all states will have to cope with a per capita cap on the total amount of dollars they receive from Washington for the Medicaid population. That big fiscal hit (bigger in the “out years”) will presumably be matched with “flexibility” for states to run Medicaid as they wish, with little or no guarantees of coverage for any specific individuals — in other words, it will no longer be an “entitlement.”\nAnother big feature of the draft is that Obamacare’s various taxes are repealed and then replaced with the long-standing GOP idea of limiting the tax deductions businesses receive for providing employee health insurance. Like Obamacare’s highly controversial and congressionally delayed “Cadillac tax,” the new provision would expose high-cost employer-sponsored premiums to taxation. When GOP presidential nominee John McCain proposed that in 2008, Barack Obama very effectively accused him of favoring a tax increase .\nThe inclusion of this potentially toxic provision may help explain some of the plan’s omissions, too, like money for that perennial conservative favorite, Health Savings Accounts to cover routine medical expenses. It could be this draft was really aimed at testing the revenue, spending, and health-coverage consequences the Congressional Budget Office will deduce when the actual bill is sent to CBO for “scoring.” HSAs could be held back temporarily to address (at least theoretically) some big hole in coverage. Or maybe this draft is already ancient history. We will know soon enough, but in the meantime, it’s interesting to see all the loose talk about Obamacare repeal and replacement reflected in legislative language.\nTags: obamacare repeal-and-replace tax increase congressional budget office House Obamacare Repeal Draft: Dangerous Work in Progress Trump’s Rollback on Transgender Bathroom Rule Is Just the Beginning Trump Can’t Stop Undermining His Claim to Represent the Workers Party Trump’s Health-Care Nightmare Is Only Just Beginning Most Viewed Stories This Obscure News Story, Which Should Be Huge, Shows How Trump Gets Away With Corruption Customs Agents Check Passengers’ IDs on Domestic Flight at JFK Trump Condemns FBI Leakers for Leaking That He Asked Them to Leak Connie Britton Leaves Nashville Fans With the Cold Comfort of a Heartfelt Coda After That Momentous Episode Trump’s Health-Care Nightmare Is Only Just Beginning Vulture’s Final 2017 Oscar Predictions for Every Category Video Games Are Better Than Real Life 15 Stars Reminisce About the Actors Who Used to Beat Them Out for Roles Trump Can’t Stop Undermining His Claim to Represent the Workers Party Trump’s Counterterrorism Adviser Sebastian Gorka Has Links to Anti-Semitic Groups Most Popular Video On Daily Intelligencer The Wildest Moments From Donald Trump’s Press Conference Latest News from Daily Intelligencer 6:19 p.m. New York City Recorded Its Lowest Number of Traffic Fatalities in 2016 A small dip from 2015, but the third-straight yearly decline under Vision Zero.\n6:13 p.m. Democrats Make a Risky Pick for Response to Trump’s Big Speech to Congress Former Kentucky governor Steve Beshear is an out-of-work centrist representing a party that’s energized on the left.\n6:04 p.m. Leaked House Obamacare Repeal Draft Shows Dangerous Work in Progress A leaked document shows House Republicans mulling controversial ideas like ending Medicaid as we know it and a new tax on employer-provided insurance.\n5:42 p.m. Leaked DHS Report Undermines Trump’s Argument for His Travel Ban It says citizenship in the Muslim-majority countries included in the ban is an “unlikely indicator” of a terrorism threat.\n4:50 p.m. GOP Tax Cut Waiting for Trump to Decide on Policy He Clearly Doesn’t Understand Don’t feel bad for Paul Ryan, he’ll end up getting a big tax cut for the rich in the end.\n4:31 p.m. A Bunch of Cities Are Sweating Through the Hottest February Day on Record It’s been a hot month, with nearly 4,500 record highs set, compared to 29 record lows.\n3:51 p.m. Kansas Suspect Allegedly Said ‘Get Out of My Country,’ Then Shot 2 Indian Men The White House denied any links to President Trump’s rhetoric.\n3:39 p.m. White House Bars New York Times , CNN, and Politico From Press Briefing Earlier in the day, Trump explained that the media isn’t the “enemy of the people” — but the fake news media is .\n2:40 p.m. Trump Expected to Pick Man Known For Bad Economic Advice As Top Economic Adviser Kevin Hassett once co-authored a book imploring investors to enter the stock market — just before the dot-com bubble burst.\n2:37 p.m. Trump Offers Conservatives the World — in Exchange for Their Principles Is the mainstream right ready to replace its traditional values with pure nationalism?\n1:04 p.m. Trump’s Rollback on Transgender Bathroom Rule Is Just the Beginning It looked like Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s warm-up act in loosening protections for all minorities.\n12:57 p.m. Trump Praises First Amendment, Calls for Media Suppression and Fewer Protests The president told CPAC the media “shouldn’t be allowed” to cite anonymous sources, and suggested people shouldn’t protest after an election.\n12:23 p.m. Trump Can’t Stop Undermining His Claim to Represent the Workers Party “We will not answer to donors, lobbyists, or special interests … now here’s another story about me answering to special interests.”\n11:56 a.m. Trump’s Security Adviser Sebastian Gorka Has Links to Anti-Semitic Groups This may be the lowlight of a week that also saw him make an unhinged phone call to a critic that got recorded and published.\n11:51 a.m. Trump: U.S. Has ‘Fallen Behind’ on Nukes, Vows to Return to ‘Top of the Pack’ This isn’t the first time the president has appeared to advocate for nuclear proliferation.\n9:44 a.m. Trump Condemns FBI Leakers for Leaking That He Asked Them to Leak The White House asked the FBI to leak exculpating details about Trump’s ties with Russia.
