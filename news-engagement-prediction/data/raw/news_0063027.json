By: FE Online | Patna | Published: February 24, 2017 12:27 PM Rabri Devi claims her statement was blown out of proportion. (ANI) \nRashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) supremo Lalu Prasad’s wife Rabri Devi has claimed that people of Bihar want to see her son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav as state’s chief minister, a report by ‘The Indian Express’ has said. She said this while reacting to questions on growing demand among RJD MLAs for installing Tejashwi as the CM as RJD is the larger party with 80 seats in Bihar’s ruling alliance with JD(U) and Congress . \nHowever, Rabri Devi later clarified that she was speaking about 2020 assembly elections in the state. She further said that Nitish Kumar would remain the leader of the alliance and CM. “Janta ki maang hai (it is people’s demand),” she told journalists before budget session of the state assembly. \nShe, later claimed that her statement was blown out of proportion. “Nitish Kumar is the leader of the Grand Alliance till 2020. What will happen in 2020 polls would be decided by people,’’ the former CM clarified. JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said Devi has the right to say whatever she wants. He added that Prasad and Devi have accepted Nitish as chief minister. \nFew days back, Commenting on ‘achche din’, Lalu Prasad said, PM Narendra Modi talks about ‘achche din’ but ‘achche din’ was during the Congress rule. On demonetisation, Lalu compared the new Rs 2000 notes with ‘Churan ki Pudia’. While these remarks by the former Bihar CM tickled the funny bones of those present in his rally, Lalu made a shocking allegation against PM Modi and asked as to how Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s health deteriorated suddenly. \n“Atal ji is on bed. It should be probed as to who is responsible for his condition. What medicine was he given? Rajnath Singh couldn’t even keep his own secretary. This the condition they have been subjected by Modi,” Lalu had said. \nYou may also like to watch this video \nThe RJD chief also commented on expelled SP leader Amar Singh, saying the latter is experienced in breaking families apart.
