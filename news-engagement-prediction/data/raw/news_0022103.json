T+L Newsletters \nFind drinks with a view—even in the depths of winter. \nFor city-dwellers, summertime means sunny days and rooftop revelry . But in winter, all those breezy terraces with skyline views get shut down, thanks to colder temperatures and pesky inclement weather. \nThe Envoy Hotel in Boston , however, has come up with a seasonally-appropriate approach to drawing in rooftop drinkers: constructing \"igloos\" at their Lookout Rooftop & Bar —and keeping the party going despite the winter chill. \nThe futuristic-looking structures aren't actually made of ice, of course. Instead, they're build from lit-up plastic panels with heated interiors to keep patrons cozy. Revelers will be able to order cocktails by pressing a button for service, all while taking advantage of the unique perspective on a wintry city night in Boston's Seaport District. \nThis isn't the first time a rooftop bar has put up igloos for patrons; Manhattan's 230 Fifth has been going strong with its own little village of pop-up spaces in winter since 2014, a seasonal development that has proved popular over the years. \nThe Envoy, meanwhile, will have six igloos, each seating eight to 10 people at a time, and will be open only on weekends.
