Anything can happen until the end. We must continue to work in this way, to fight, to try to win in the same way we tried today.” \nConte was unhappy with the result, even though Burnley had won seven of their previous eight home games.

But sometimes you must understand that there are tough games, and this game was very tough. \n“I’m pleased because we tried to win. I’m disappointed for the points, not for commitment, work-rate, will to fight, will to win. \n“I’m disappointed because I like to win. I always like to take three points and my players are like this.” \nConte also praised Thibaut Courtois for making two fine stops after Robbie Brady had cancelled out Pedro’s opener and claimed his side stood up well to Burnley’s long-ball tactics. \n“For sure, our goalkeeper stays there to make a save sometimes,” he said. \n“Today we tried to play football. We tried to create situations. We found a team that tried to disrupt our football, to play these long-balls and to fight for the second balls. \n“I have great respect for every type of football. I don’t like to judge the other.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T00:47:13.359+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
