[They] locked the referee room until police arrived in order to escort them to their vehicles.”\n \nHockey #Edmonton reminding parents to be respectful during games. 5+ parents suspended this past month, adding that's unusual. #yeg #Hockey pic.twitter.com/Cz3XIGd0Gi \n— Angela Jung (@AngelaJungCTV) February 26, 2017 Stefan Brown, the chair of the North Zone Referees Committee, told CTV News that screaming at officials does not help their performance.\n“They don’t want to come to the arena to be abused on a daily basis when things go array.” Brown said. “I think parents need to realize it’s just a game and officials are part of the game. It’s not productive yelling and screaming at the officials.”\nDoran told parents that these incidents give credence to the “typical hockey parent” belief.\n“This type of behavior not only puts a black eye on our sport but puts you in the spotlight as well,” Doran wrote in the email.\nParents who get suspended are not allowed inside arenas. They have to drop their player off and wait in the parking lot until the game is finished.\nDoran told parents Hockey Edmonton “[loses] a number of Officials every year because of threats made by parents and coaching staff towards them. We can’t afford to lose these folks; they are integral part of our game. \nBrown believes that suspending parents will help reduce the number of unacceptable incidents in youth hockey.\n“I think it sends a clear message that these sorts of behaviour are unacceptable and won’t be tolerated.”\nWith files from Angela Jung \nPhotos Hockey Edmonton says they have suspended a number of parents following \"unacceptable incidents.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T02:49:47.227+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
