Saha, Head, Air Pollution Monitoring, CPCB. He added that the agency only calculated average figures because there was tremendous variation within a year among cities, mostly on account of rainfall. \nThe numbers come on the back of international research reports attributing about a million deaths in India to air pollution. The Environment Ministry has said these mortality figures were “extrapolations without due scientific validation” but hasn’t countered with numbers of its own. It is, along with the Health Ministry, working on a study to assess ‘official’ mortality from air pollution. \nKey directives by the Centre to the States to control particulate matter pollution include promoting public transport, improving fuel quality and fuel efficiency standards and banning burning of leaves, biomass and municipal solid waste.
