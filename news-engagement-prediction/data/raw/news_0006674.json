We are supposed to praise her for her honesty, her bravery in revealing to the world her ample, generous flesh and her generosity in letting us into her innermost of inner sanctums. Because, of course, Beyonce would argue none of this has anything to do with self-publicity. Or, for that matter, with the fact that she may or may not have gone just a tiny bit bonkers from living in a world where importing 70,000 rare orchids from Thailand for a wedding is considered normal. Or because she is desperate to show her husband what he would be missing were he ever to dare step out of line, and wants the entire world to bear witness. No, Beyonce is doing this because she is a generous and caring superstar who loves her adoring public so very much and just knows how special and precious and, yes, inspirational these pictures of her will be for her fans. 25 YEARS OF FAME-HUNGRY MUMMIES Actress Demi Moore paved the way in 1991, while TV presenter Myleene Klass struck a pose in 2007. Supermodel Claudia Schiffer followed in 2010, and Superstar Mariah Carey bared her bump in 2011. The fact that all this will have been achieved thanks to armies of minions slathering tub-loads of organic mango butter into those thighs to make them look perfectly smooth; that hair and make-up will have been meticulously applied and re-applied; that endless stylists and lighting experts will have been drafted in to create just the perfect image of perfection possible is by-the-by. For we ordinary mortals can now worship at the altar of this bump. Or must we? Are we perhaps not just a little bit entitled to feel irritated by this self-aggrandising spectacle, with its narcissistic symbolism and excess of cliches. Big sister Blue Ivy kissing the sainted bump, a bunch of roses in her hand; Beyonce reclining on a bed of blooms as her daughter, somewhat awkwardly, hands her a white flower? Joining in the photoshoot was Beyonce and husband Jay Z’s daughter — big sister-to-be Blue Ivy, 5 Beyonce floating in a swimming pool, as Osun, an African deity of water, love and fertility. Are we really supposed to take this nonsense seriously? How many more times are we expected to glory in photos of so-called celebrities, in various states of undress, cradling their precious baby bumps, as though they were the first women ever to get pregnant? With Demi Moore, posing on the front of Vanity Fair back in 1991, at least she had the benefit of novelty. Since then, countless have followed in her wake and copied the pose, maybe with a billowing sheet here, a set of pearls there. And later, when there wasn’t a magazine shoot forthcoming, there came picture-sharing social media Instagram, where they could thrust their fecundity and splendour into the laps of millions instantly. And what do they say about familiarity breeding contempt? I must confess, I always greet these pictures with a groan and a roll of the eyes. Do I really want to see all that again? There is nothing wrong with taking a few pictures of one’s pregnancy. Every mother likes to look back to that time as something a little bit magical and special, to remember how it felt to be carrying a new life (in my case, rather hot and uncomfortable, but you know what I mean). But, rather like holiday slides, or children’s school play videos, they are only really of any interest to the immediate participants. Anything else is just pure vanity. Next time, Beyonce — if indeed there is a next time — just buy a photo album. I think we know what your — or anyone’s — pregnancy looks like now. POEMS FOR A PRIMADONNA Second planet from the sun, I wake up on her foamy shore. She wants to take me to meet my children. I’ve done this before, I’m still nervous. Mother is a cocoon where cells spark, limbs form, Mother swells and stretches to protect her child Mother has one foot in this world and one foot in the next, Mother, black venus. I look at photographs of my mother When she was pregnant with me, Does she feel how I feel now? Venus falls in love, Love touches her, This is how she is reborn. I’m watching life inside me grow; There’s life growing inside of me And I’m beside myself with dreams.
