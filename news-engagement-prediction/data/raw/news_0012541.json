Story Continued Below \nThe Justice Department is expected to file an emergency stay motion as soon as Saturday night. \nThat motion would go a three-judge panel, likely consisting of Richard Clifton (a George W. Bush appointee), William Canby Jr. (Jimmy Carter) and Michelle Friedland (Barack Obama). \nOne potential hurdle for the Trump administration: temporary restraining orders are not ordinarily appealable. Usually a party who wants to appeal has to wait until the next stage in the process, a preliminary injunction. \nIf the 9th Circuit declines to step in and block Robart's order, the Justice Department could seek a stay from the Supreme Court. Such stay requests are usually referred to the full court, which remains shorthanded at the moment with just eight justices. That raises the prospect that the high court could deadlock, which would leave any 9th Circuit ruling in force.
