It’s been a long time in the making, as hinted on 2001's “Right Now & Later On” record , but Fabolous ’ famous chipped tooth is no longer his signature look. As TMZ reports , the Brooklyn rapper spent nearly $40K to get his teeth fixed recently as a birthday treat to himself. Apparently, Fab got all the work done before New York Fashion Week, where he got a set of 10 new veneers on his top grill. He got the work done with NY dentist Mojgan Fajiram, who charges $4k per veneer, so the math adds up to a light $40K. TMZ was somehow able to get their hands on the before & after pictures, and there’s definitely a major upgrade. Check it out for yourself in the gallery (above), but beware the before is pretty bold & in-your-face. < class=\"robots-nocontent\" rel=\"\"> Feb 23, 2017 at 04:27am 448 Views \nInstagram has rolled out a new feature allowing users to upload 10 pics/videos into one post.
