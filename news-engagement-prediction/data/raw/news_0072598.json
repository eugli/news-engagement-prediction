We travel all over the world, we build families, we construct stories, we build life that cannot be divided,” Bernal said.\n“As a Mexican, as a Latin-American, as a migrant worker, as a human being, I’m against any form of wall that wants to separate us.”\nBreaking from his own tradition, President Trump refrained from live-tweeting the Oscars this year. (Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP) Trump, who refrained from live-tweeting the award show like he has in the past, came up several times throughout the night, including host Jimmy Kimmel’s opening monologue.\n“Maybe this isn’t a popular thing to say, but I want to say thank you to President Trump,” he said. “Remember last year when it seemed like the Oscars were racist? That's gone, thanks to him.”\nSend a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T06:14:07.632+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
