The company announced it was laying off 430 people from its headquarters in Mooresville. Lowe’s will also cut an additional 70 support positions in its Wilkesboro location and about 25 corporate support jobs located in other facilities. “It is always very difficult to make decisions like these that impact our people, and we did so only after careful consideration and with the understanding that our actions today were needed to position Lowe’s for the future,” the company said in a statement. This is the second round of layoffs for Lowe’s this year. In January, it cut 2,400 managers in an effort to shift its focus to customers. The company’s third-quarter profits and sales report in Nov. 2016 missed estimates by analysts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:33:57.667+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
