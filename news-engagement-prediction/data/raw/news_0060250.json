Mumbai: It turned out to be quite a roller-coaster ride for BJP spokesperson Atul Shah. And it's unlikely he will forget this win or the number 5496 in a hurry. That's the exact number of votes both Atul Shah and Shiv Sena 's Surendra Bagalkar polled and it meant their votes had to be counted at least twice before Election Commission officials decided to let lady luck take the final call. As the results of all other wards kept trickling in, ward no. 220 was stuck on a tie. The tie-breaker was a chit that would eventually decide the winner, picked by a five-year-old girl. Yashika Salunkhe, the granddaughter of the security guard Keshav Phanaswadikar at Gilder Lane Municipal School, Mumbai Central, was summoned to decide the first ever tie in the history of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections. In pictures, the girl is seen on a stage with civic chief Ajoy Mehta and other BMC officials, picking a chit out of a metal container. The girl is then seen to be opening the chit and showing it to the audience. Atul Shah was seen erupting into a victorious cheer following the tie-breaker. The BMC elections held on February 21, saw the highest voter turnout in the past 25 years (55.28 per cent). Counting of votes and declaration of results has now put the Shiv Sena at 84 and the BJP a close second with 82 seats. Congress and NCP fared poorly, bagging only 31 and 9 seats respectively.
