Key points: House voted 235-180 to scuttle regulation to extend background checks NRA, gun advocates supported overturning legislation Republicans employing rarely used tool to roll back some of the Obama administration's rules \nThe Senate gave final approval to a measure eliminating a rule to prevent coal mining debris from being dumped into nearby streams, while the House backed a separate resolution doing away with extended background checks for gun purchases by some social security recipients with mental disabilities. \nThe Senate's 54-45 vote sent the repeal of the stream protection rule to President Donald Trump. The gun measure awaits Senate action. Australia is learning the hard way that Donald Trump is in office every bit the rule-breaker he promised to be on the way to the White House, writes Greg Jennett. \nThe issue was an Obama rule extending background checks for disabled social security recipients mentally incapable of managing their own affairs, which the House voted 235-180 to scuttle. \nUnder the rule, the Social Security Administration had to provide information to the gun-buying background check system on recipients with a mental disorder so severe they cannot work and need someone to handle their benefits. The rule, also finalised in December, would have affected an estimated 75,000 beneficiaries. \nAfter the 2012 school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, former president Barack Obama directed the Justice Department to provide guidance to agencies regarding information they were obligated to report to the background check system. \nIn Newtown, 20 children and six educators were shot to death when a gunman entered the Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012. The gunman had earlier killed his mother inside their home, and he used a gun and ammunition that she had purchased. His mental health problems have been extensively reported since the shooting. \nGun rights groups and advocates for the disabled supported the repeal effort. \n\"There is no evidence suggesting that those receiving disability benefits from the Social Security Administration are a threat to public safety,\" Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Bob Goodlatte said. \n\"Once an unelected bureaucrat unfairly adds these folks to the federal background check system, they are no longer able to exercise their Second Amendment right.\" \n\"These are people with a severe mental illness who can't hold any kind of job or make any decisions about their affairs, so the law says very clearly they shouldn't have a firearm,\" Representative for the Democrats Mike Thompson said. \nThe NRA said overturning the regulation would protect a broad class of vulnerable citizens from Government overreach. Senate votes to eliminate coal mining rule \nAs the House voted on gun regulation, the Senate gave final approval to a measure eliminating a rule to prevent coal mining debris from being dumped into nearby streams. \nThe White House said on Thursday night (local time) that Mr Trump supports both measures and is likely to sign them. \nThe Interior Department, which announced the rule in December, said that it would protect 9,656 kilometres of streams and 52,000 acres of forests, preventing coal mining debris from being dumped into nearby waters. \nRepublicans and some Democrats say the coal mining rule could eliminate thousands of coal-related jobs and ignores dozens of federal, state and local regulations already in place. \nDemocrats called the vote an attack on clean water and a clear win for big coal-mining companies and other polluters. \nThe Senate's 54-45 vote sends the repeal of the stream protection rule to Mr Trump. \nRepublicans are employing a rarely used tool to roll back some of the rules issued in the final months of Obama's tenure. \nThe Congressional Review Act provides a temporary window for a simple majority of both chambers to invalidate a rule. \nThe President has to sign the disapproval measure for the regulation to be deemed invalid. \nThe law also prevents the executive branch from imposing substantially similar regulations in the future. \nAP/Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T11:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T07:01:56.717+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
