Mira Rajput invites Shahid Kapoor's ex on his pre-birthday bash? – check out pic \n“Outstanding”, “fabulous”, “passionate” are the only kind of reactions we’re getting to hear from whoever has watched Shahid Kapoor, Kangana Ranaut and Saif Ali Khan’s Rangoon so far. Director Vishal Bhardwaj, who hosted for a couple of special screenings for the critics and Bollywood celebrities is being showered with praises for his brilliant execution and so are the actors being appreciated for their hard hitting performances. Renowned filmmaker Aanand L Rai is so impressed by Rangoon that he tweeted, “Luved Julia portrayed by Kangana, Shahid Kapoor is 1 of d most fearless actors we have. Saif sir it’s so easy 2 fall in luv wid u. # Rangoon. You can only describe Rangoon with one word, Passion. Complex characters dealt in a very passionate way, Vishal Bhardwaj forte.” Now if this doesn’t some up the phenomenal film like Rangoon then I dunno what will. Other celebs who have reviewed Rangoon include Randeep Hooda, Suneil Shetty, Kriti Sanon to name a few… \nWhile Rangoon is all set to hit the screens tomorrow (Feb 24). The film basically revolves around a love story that can be called epic in every sense of the word. Giving you a gist of the plot, it has a beautiful movie actress who lands in the jungles of India-Burma border in 1944 to entertain Indian and British army troops. Julia abhors handsome Indian soldier Nawab first but falls for his charm eventually. There’s a love affair that’s forbidden yet pure. However, she soon learns about the truth of Indian independence. But things get ugly, dark, brutal and bloody when her rich lover Rusi discovers about their affair and wrecks havoc. Will Julia and Nawab’s love story get a happy ending or was it a short-lived affair? Watch the film to find out.
