The sketch, a remake of the 1987 thriller movie Fatal Attraction, plays on CNN’s recent decision to not let the real-life Conway on air after she repeatedly referenced a non-existent massacre. In it, Tapper – played by Beck Bennett – comes home to find McKinnon-as-Conway has broken into his apartment wearing just a negligee.\n“I just want to be part of the news, Jake,” McKinnon-as-Conway pleads, later pulling out a knife.\nTapper himself seemed to feel uncomfortable about the whole thing:\n  Their defence? “I guess, knowing the Constitution?”\nBaldwin, as Trump, refuses to tell the truth in court (“I’m good”), insists he signed a “tremendous” travel ban (“I didn’t read it, but I signed it”) and calls Russian President Vladimir Putin as a shirtless character witness. (“This man is my great friend. He’s my little American Happy Meal,” says Putin, also played by Beck Bennett).\nViewers loved it:\nBut the cold open on Saturday went to Melissa McCarthy who did an encore round as White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer. “First of all, I just want to announce that I’m calm now,” McCarthy begins. “This is the new ‘Spicy.’”\nSeconds later, “Old Spicy” is screaming their head off yet again. When the “dumb babies” (i.e. reporters) ask about “extreme vetting” of immigrants, Spicer once again whips out the “dollies” to explain how it all works (“We know she’s OK because she’s blond!”)\nMcCarthy’s impression of Spicer has been on the air under two weeks, yet she’s caught much of the attention online from SNL fans and reviewers.\nWith files from The Associated Press \nBut the cold open on Saturday went to Melissa McCarthy who did an encore round as White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer. “First of all, I just want to announce that I’m calm now,” McCarthy begins. “This is the new ‘Spicy.’”\nSeconds later, “Old Spicy” is screaming their head off yet again.
