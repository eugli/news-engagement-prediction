Come September, we may see no less than 3 new iPhone models, possibly named iPhone 8 , iPhone 7s , and iPhone 7s Plus . While the 7s and 7s Plus are direct successors to last year's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus , the iPhone 8 is expected to be the star of the bunch. We already heard a lot of interesting things about the iPhone 8, including the fact that it should feature a curved 5.8-inch OLED display and an \"all glass\" design. According to JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall, another notable feature of the iPhone 8 will be a 3D laser scanner for facial recognition. Reportedly, the presence of a facial recognition scanner means that Apple will do away with Touch ID on the iPhone 8. This kind of makes sense, as the iPhone 8 allegedly doesn't have a physical Home button. However, last month, we heard that the new iPhone would feature both face recognition, and a fingerprint scanner embedded into its screen, though JPMorgan's analyst doesn't seem to agree. JPMorgan's Rod Hall believes that the 3D laser scanner will be more secure than Touch ID, while also eliminating the frustration that iPhone users sometimes feel when fingerprint scanners don't work (for example, under wet circumstances). The laser scanner could also pave the way for future augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) endeavors that Apple may be pursuing, though these aren't likely to be revealed before 2018. As reported earlier today, the iPhone 8 might cost at least $1,000 . The handset could have the same overall size as the regular 4.7-inch iPhone 7s, since it's basically all-screen on the front, while the iPhone 7s probably has thick bezels around its screen (similar to the iPhone 7 - pictured above). All in all, pretty much all rumors and educated guesses are suggesting that the iPhone 8 should be the most interesting iPhone model to date. Are you excited about its launch?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T06:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:33:17.502+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
