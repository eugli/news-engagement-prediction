Winger Joseph Molongoane and left back Tsepo Masilela had half chances to grab the lead. \nMasilela should have doubled the lead shortly before the break but the defender failed to hold on to the ball inside the opposition box after being perfectly set up by Molangoane while Franklin Cale had the best opportunity to get on the score sheet for the visitors. \nCheifs’ livewire Siphiwe Tshabalala delivered an inch perfect corner kick aimed at Ramahlwe Mphahlele, who flicked the ball onto the path of Gordinho for the central defender’s fourth league of the season to join Tshabalala and Willard Katsande on top of the Chiefs top scorers list. \nThe Lions of the North should have equalised in the 66th minute when Khethukuthula Zwane’s firt-time drive forced keeper Itumeleng Khune into a spectacular save. \nHighlands coach Gordon Igesund has managed just one win in his 13 matches since taking over the reigns in October. \nIgesund's record now reads seven draws, five defeats and just one win in the 13 matches the former Bafana Bafana coach has overseen since replacing sacked Allan Freese. \nHighlands remain rooted in second spot from bottom with just 14 points from 18 matches. \nIgesund’s charges are yet to win a match in 2017 following a 3-0 thrashing at Cape Town City in their first match of the year and a 1-1 draw at home to Polokwane City on Sunday. \nChiefs will look to continue their winning run when they travel to Ajax Cape Town in their next league encounter of February 25 while Highlands will be at home to title contenders SuperSport United on the same day. \n- TMG Digital ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T20:31:52.761+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
