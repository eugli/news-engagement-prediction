(ABC News: Sallese Gibson) \n\"[Legislation] protects the interests of recreational fishing and indeed the significant contribution [it makes] to our local economy.\" \nTasmanian Association for Recreational Fishing (TARFish) chief executive Mark Nikolai welcomed the move, saying fishers wanted long-term protection for the industry. \n\"Putting it in legislation, as opposed to just having it sitting there in the management rules for the particular fishery, strengthens that protection,\" he said. \n\"Now, it's got to go to Parliament and both sides of Parliament have to agree to make those changes, so the ability of a minister or for anybody to put those changes into place is significantly more difficult into the future.\" 'Commonwealth ban needed' \nBut Nobby Clark from Game Fish Tasmania Sports Fishing Club said the move was a \"stunt\", as state waters only extended around five kilometres offshore. \n\"From five kilometres out to 200 miles is Commonwealth waters,\" he said. \n\"The majority of recreational offshore fishing takes place outside state waters ... and that's where we've been seeking protection.\" \nMr Clark said any meaningful change required a total ban on trawling in Commonwealth waters. \n\"It's the protection of the adjacent Commonwealth fishery that we've been seeking, so unfortunately it just seems a little bit hollow, to be honest,\" he said. \nCurrently, super trawlers longer than 130 metres are banned from fishing in Australian waters by regulation. \nMr Rockliff said the State Government had written to Federal Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce, pushing for the federal ban to be strengthened by legislation. \n\"We haven't heard back yet from the Federal Government but we anticipate a response in the near future,\" he said. \nMr Nikolai said TARFish was also lobbying for change at a Commonwealth level. \n\"We've been having those same discussions at a Commonwealth level since 2012,\" he said. \n\"It's extremely important that the Commonwealth Government listen to the recreational fishing sector â€” not just in Tasmania but across Australia.\" \nThe Federal Government said it banned super trawlers over 130 metres in length in 2015 by regulation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T06:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T01:55:05.160+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
