(Photo: ITV) Danny Miller, who plays Aaron Dingle (Photo: Getty Images Europe) Aaron is due to be sentenced to 12 months imprisonment (Photo: ITV) “There’s a lot of news issues around prison life and the challenges people face. We thought it would be a good opportunity to explore some of that using a really well-liked group of characters.”\nThe episode will air “in the not too distant future” according to Iain, and will be a deep dive into Aaron’s storyline.\n“I’ve yet to see it but the scripts were really fantastic. I say it’s about a day in the life of Aaron, but it’s as much as a day in the life of that family, what’s it like for somebody who’s loved their husband to prison, what’s it like for Liv losing her older brother/father figure to prison.”\nA special episode will focus on Aaron's life in jail (Photo: ITV) Read More Danny Miller leaving Emmerdale?
