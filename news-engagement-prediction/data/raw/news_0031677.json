While Westbrook finished 47 points and eight assists, he also had 11 turnovers. According to ESPN, on the seven plays Durant guarded Westbrook, Westbrook went 2-of-5 from the field for eight points with one turnover. \nOne some occasions, it went great for Westbrook. \nOther times, it led to Westbrook taking heat-check three-pointers with 17 seconds left on the shot clock. \nIt’s a ruthless ploy by Kerr to pit Westbrook’s emotions against him. It also could have risked throwing off Durant, having to guard an explosive scorer like Westbrook, his former teammate, while visiting the arena he called home for eight years. \nHowever, tactically, it worked for the Warriors, who, despite being outscored by five in the quarter, built such a big lead early on that they were able to maintain a sizable advantage through the quarter. Sure, Westbrook hit some shots, but he also appeared to get caught up in the moment and his blend of one-man offence wasn’t enough to help the Thunder make an actual push. \nFollow Business Insider Australia on Facebook , Twitter , LinkedIn , and Instagram .
