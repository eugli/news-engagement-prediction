A man facing trial for possession of narcotics broke down at the court saying he did not commit any crime deliberately. The 35-year-old Arab national claimed drugs found in his bag at the Sharjah International Airport were given to him by a friend. At a Sharjah court hearing, presided by judge Hussain Al Ousofu, the defendant, said: \"I am here not because I committed a crime or sin, but because of an unwise decision.\" The accused, O.P., told the court that one of his friends promised him a job in the UAE. While he was packing the bags to come to the UAE, his friends, acquaintances and neighbours came to greet him. One of his friends wanted him to hand over some tablets to his sister who has been using the medicine. The friend also told him they will contact him to collect the medicine. However, when he arrived at the Sharjah International airport last November, a customs officer stopped him and asked him to open the bag. He was stunned to hear from the officials that his bag contained narcotic tablets. The case has been adjourned to March 2.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T15:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T08:32:39.236+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
