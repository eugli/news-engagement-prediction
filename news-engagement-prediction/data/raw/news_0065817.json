What did Mr Trump say? \nSpeaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday, he sought to justify his crackdown on immigration by criticising the effect it had had on some European countries. Media caption Five things we learned about President Trump from his address to conservative activists. \nHe singled out Paris, mentioning a friend called \"Jim\" who used to be a regular visitor to the city but had stopped going in recent years because \"Paris is no longer Paris\". \n\"Take a look at what's happening to our world, folks, and we have to be smart... We can't let that happen to us.\" Mr Trump went on. \nAre things as bad as Trump says? What was the French response? \nMs Hidalgo stressed the inclusivity and energy of Paris, tweeting a picture of her launching a tourism campaign at the Eiffel Tower. Image copyright Anne/HidalgoTwitter \nShe also challenged the suggestion that tourist numbers from the US were in decline, saying reservations were up 30% in 2017. \nMr Hollande, meanwhile, said Mr Trump's remarks were no way to behave towards an ally. \n\"It is never good to show the slightest mistrust towards a friendly country,\" he said. \n\"That is not what I would do towards a friendly country and I would ask the American president not to do it to France.\" \nIn a reference to France's tighter gun control laws, Mr Hollande said: \"There are no weapons circulating here. There are no people who take weapons to shoot into the crowd simply for the satisfaction of causing drama and tragedy.\" So are tourists really deserting the City of Lights? \nAccording to figures published by the Paris Office of Tourism (in French) , 7,356,945 foreign tourists arrived at hotels in the city of Paris between January and November 2016, 11.9% fewer than in the same period the previous year. \nAmong American tourists the decline was only slighter smaller - there were 1,387,191 hotel arrivals, down 9.9%. \nIn the same period there was a slight rise in the number of tourists from other parts of France, of 0.3% to almost six million.

How does it compare with New York? \nAccording to the New York mayor's office , the city welcomed 60.3 million visitors in 2016, up by 1.8 million on 2015. \nThis was the \"seventh consecutive year of travel and tourism growth for the city\", the statement said. \nOf these, 47.6 million came from within the US and 12.65 million from abroad. Both figures were all-time highs, the mayor's office added.
