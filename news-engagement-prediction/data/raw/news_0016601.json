Son of a Hungarian immigrant and a French mother of Greek-Jewish origin; grew up in Paris Began his political career as mayor of the affluent Paris suburb of Neuilly from 1983 to 2002 Nicknamed president \"bling-bling\" by critics for his flashy leadership style As president, pushed through reforms including raising the retirement age from 60 to 62 and relaxing the 35-hour working week.
