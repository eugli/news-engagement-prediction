So, today we will suggest you a few things which are a must to pack before you set out on a sojourn. \nHere are few essentials which one must carry while travelling to make the journey a comfortable one: \nFirst Aid Kit: This one is the most important of all the essentials! One must have a first aid kit ready while you pack. This will help you out if in any case you fall ill or need any instant medication. Also, you can help fellow travellers, if need be. To ensure your safety while packing the bag don't forget to pack a first aid kit. \nDocuments: One must need to check all the relevant documents you need if you are travelling abroad. You might need them in a foreign land. \nClothes: The most obvious must-pack item. You must pack clothes which will keep the luggage light and are essential for you while travelling. Don't overload your small bag with stuff you don't need. Travel light! \nWater: Always carry a water bottle with you while you explore the new destination.
