By Cathal McNaughton/Pool/Getty Images. Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith, has only one higher power to answer to. Other than God’s divine authority, Queen Elizabeth has absolute dominion over her lands and subjects. (Well, also, there’s Parliament and the prime minister and stuff, but whatever.) So when one has a pressing matter, a noble cause, that one wants desperately to reach the Queen’s ears, one has very few options as to who can be one’s advocate. Of course you can try to go through the Queen’s family. Perhaps cozy up to Prince Charles at some event by talking about salmon fishing or Burnley F.C. Or you could hand Prince Harry a manila envelope full of long-lens 8-by-10 photos and watch as his face sinks with recognition and horror, knowing then that he’ll do whatever you ask. You could activate your sleeper agent, ensconced deep in Buckingham Palace, but the C.I.A. is probably not quite ready to blow Duchess Kate’s cover quite yet. Past that, there is really only one other option. That option, of course, is Pamela Anderson. So it’s no surprise that a Russian faux-fur company has teamed up with the Barb Wire star to urge the Queen to stop using real black-bear hair to make the Buckingham Palace guards’ big fuzzy hats. Page Six says that one Canadian black bear dies for each hat, which is insane. The last time I killed a Canadian black bear—lost and frightened after my plane crashed high in the Sawback Range—I got at least two hats out of the deal. No, I’m kidding. What’s insane is a tradition of a majestic black bear needing to die so some ceremonial guards can look silly. That’s bad! Anderson has long been an animal-rights activist, and she’s apparently been hanging out in Russia a lot lately. So it makes a strange kind of sense that she’d be working with a Russian company to plead with the Queen to stop killing bears. The Queen might listen! If Elizabeth II can be persuaded by anyone besides her most trusted family and advisers, it’s bound to be Pamela Anderson. The company Anderson is working with, Only Me, is said to be sending some hat samples to the Palace. If they’re good enough, and Anderson makes her case compellingly enough, maybe this bear carnage will finally end. Help them, Pamela Anderson. You’re their only hope. (Seriously, good luck.) Of course, Palace guard hats are not the only royal-related items that use animal products. Every member of the family is given a beautiful set of ivory false teeth, hewn from the finest elephant tusks, at birth. (Sometimes Prince George will put the false teeth in and give his sister quite a fright.) All official royal proclamations are issued on gilded eel skin. (Though, at least the rest of the animal is used to make delicious eel pies in the enormous kitchens deep under the Palace.) And, of course, Prince Phillip is actually just a series of trumpeter swans they’ve been dressing up in Gieves & Hawkes suits all these years. So there is a lot to be addressed by the royal family, vis–à–vis animal rights and animal protection. Miles to go. But the black-bear hats are definitely a good, actionable start. Hopefully at this very moment the Queen is being alerted to the issue and has raised her wizened head and asked, with grace and authority, “What does Pamela Anderson think?” 1 / 30 Crowning Glory Hubba hubba! For a 1954 royal tour of Australia—taken the year after her coronation ceremony—the young queen wore slim white lace and gloves and actually carried a parasol to go with her wide-brimmed “cartwheel”-style straw hat. It’s all very New Look–ish—perhaps proof that at least at one point, she flicked through Vogue like the rest of us. Photo: From News Ltd/Newspix/Rex USA. Animal print and red lipstick on the Queen—watch out, Joan! With a soft pea-green velvet crushed beret and matching bouclé coat of the same color—prepare to see this concept reiterated—the Queen kicked it up a notch with an ocelot-fur scarf in 1958. Photo: From Rex USA. For the Royal Horticultural Society’s annual Chelsea Flower Show—the traditional May kickoff to the English summer social season—the Queen takes extra care to inspect the fragrance quotient of a carnation in her bandeau hat, printed to match the collar of her swing coat. This photograph dates from 1958, when bandeaus and swing silhouettes were the height of chic. Photo: By Npa Rota /Rex USA. The beginning of the floral-cap years, our personal favorites: Elizabeth wore a white-petaled hat ( made en vogue at one point by Elizabeth Taylor ) over sea-green bouclé and a diamond brooch for the Epsom Derby, held every June in Surrey. The year, 1962, was the first Jubilee-like celebration for the Queen, as it marked her 10-year anniversary on the throne. Photo: By Reginald Davis/Rex USA. With her fox-fur headband, a tweed coat, and a softly lopped scarf held in place with a brooch, the Queen’s cushier, more pastel elder style is a sharp contrast to her primary-color turbans of the 1970s. Here, she clutches a yellow rose while celebrating Christmas at Sandringham, her other country estate, in 2010. Photo: By Geoffrey Robinson/Rex/Rex USA. For the occasion of the royal wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, the Queen wore the ultimate shade of optimism—primrose yellow—topped with a crepe hat featuring handmade yellow-silk roses and warm apricot-colored leaves. The beading at the neckline of her coatdress—designed by her longtime go-to dressmaker, Angela Kelly—reportedly mimicked the rays of the sun . Photo: By Tim Rooke/Rex/Rex USA. Throughout 2012’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations, the Duchess of Cambridge (the former Kate Middleton) has joined Her Majesty for a variety of engagements across England. They’ve apparently grown quite close—and seem completely in step here, in Leicester, wearing hats perched at an angle. The Queen is in fuchsia and black wool felt with button trim; Kate wears a dark James Lock hat with her L.K. Bennett jacket and dress . Photo: By David Hartley/Rupert Hartley/Rex/Rex USA.
