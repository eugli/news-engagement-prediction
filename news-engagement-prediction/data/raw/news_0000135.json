What was made known were two iconic landmarks. The contractor thought the tree would be a great landmark and he went out of his way to choose the type of the tree,” he said. \nZaini explained that the RM180,000 covered the cost of buying the 3.5m tree and transporting it from Brazil. \nA second Ceiba chodatii tree, which is scheduled to arrive in six months, will be planted at another entry point to the township. \nZaini said that apart from the two trees, the 100ha land would also be planted with local trees and plants. \nNearby residents who have seen the tree gave it their thumbs-up. \n“It’s a beautiful tree. I am sure it will be an attraction some day and the spillover would be enjoyed by the local traders when we have many visitors,” said Noor Azirah Wahab, 27, from Kampung Bukit Bayas. \nMohd Zulkifli Abdul Rani Zaki, 33, a trader from Kampung Gong Datok, Gong Badak said it was a pity that the tree had drawn bad publicity as he felt that it would capture the hearts of many. \nNor Haslinda Ali, 26, a mother of two from Gong Badak here said the state government and its agencies should not feel worried. \n“We can’t satisfy everyone,” she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:45:37.830+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
