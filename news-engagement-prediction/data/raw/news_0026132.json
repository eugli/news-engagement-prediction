Not surprisingly, Xiaomi also unveiled a special edition of the Redmi Note 4X based on the iconic character. \nDubbed the Redmi Note 4X Hatsune Miku Special Edition, this particular variant of the device comes with the character’s signature blue colour; each phone also comes with a unique code and Hatsune Miku’s signature on the back. Aside from that, a limited edition Mi Power Bank and casing based on Hatsune Miku will also be bundled along with the device. \nXiaomi also revealed several key specifications of the Redmi Note 4X, including a 5.5-inch 1080p display, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor – much like the new Redmi Note 4 launched in India – as well as a 4,100mAh battery and 13MP shooter. It’s also worth noting that the Redmi Note 4X seems to sport the same design as its predecessor. \nThe Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X will be officially introduced on 14 February next week; the Hatsune Miku variant will also be available for purchase on that day in China.
