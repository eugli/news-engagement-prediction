Peter Gronow has damaged his Mercedes Coupe because he has to manoeuvre around an Ausgrid pole at the top of his driveway.

You just don’t want to risk moving it. Lisa refuses to use the driveway now. \n“I’ve already scratched one of the wheels on brickwork because I was concentrating on missing the pole. It’s costing me $200. I’m asking Ausgrid for the money.” The pole at the end of Peter Gronow’s driveway. Picture: Craig Wilson Source: News Limited The Ausgrid pole in front of Peter’s driveway.
