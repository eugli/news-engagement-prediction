Rec There are different ways for college football recruits to announce a commitment to whichever school they choose. A simple Twitter announcement is common these days. Hat ceremonies have not gone out of style. Professionally produced videos work, too. The entire process leaves a lot of room for surprises . But I think this might be my favorite commitment scene of the 2017 recruiting cycle, courtesy of three-star Oregon signee Cyrus Habibi-Likio, of Mountainview, Calif. A beautiful unforgettable moment. The entire Oregon staff and almost all of @cyrri3e family in home for his @oregonfootball commitment pic.twitter.com/X9Iv6sOkFt — Aremon Habibi (@Aremon45) February 4, 2017 Habibi-Likio is a running back/linebacker/safety prospect who’d become a top priority for Willie Taggart’s Oregon staff. The Ducks proved as much by sending what looks like pretty close to their entire coaching staff to Habibi-Likio’s house, just a few nights before Wednesday’s Signing Day. (In-home visits before Signing Day are a staple of national recruiting, as teams try to close strong.) Related Inside Taggart's 1st NSD at Oregon, where everything sounds new Anyway, I think this is cool. It’s not common to get video of a player celebrating his commitment with a coaching staff, because coaches can’t post anything too specific about prospects until they’ve signed, and most Signing Day ceremonies are done at high schools or someplace else while coaches hunker down at the team facility. Watching Habibi-Likio and Taggart hug it out in this moment is a neat window into recruiting. Also, Oregon defensive coordinator Jim Leavitt is really excited. @Aremon45 on Twitter Habibi-Likio publicly committed to Oregon on Jan. 26. He’s the No. 47 prospect in California and the No. 25 athlete in the class of 2017, according to the 247Sports Composite.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T06:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T01:34:49.402+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
