When asked about Ivanka and her father’s tweet on Wednesday addressing her issues with Nordstrom, Kellyanne shared, “This is a very successful business woman twice. Obviously she’s stepped away from it now, but in the past she’s helped to run her family’s real estate empire. On the side, she developed another fully, unbelievably entrepreneurial, wildly successful business that bears her name.”\nShe addressed Ivanka’s critics, saying, “I do find it ironic that you’ve got some executives all over the Internet bragging about what they’ve done to her and her line, yet they’re using the most prominent women — she’s his daughter — who has been a champion for women empowerment, women in the workplace to get to him. So I think people can see through that.”\nIn her closing remarks, she delivered a message that’s making waves across the Internet. “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff is what I would tell you. I hate shopping; I’m gonna go get some myself today.”\n“It’s a wonderful line. I own some of it,” she continued. “I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody.”\nKellyanne Conway, from the White House: \"Go buy Ivanka's stuff!\" pic.twitter.com/81QfBQpiWD\n— Justin Green (@JGreenDC) February 9, 2017\nMany took issue with the Counselor to the President directing viewers across the nation to buy products from the Ivanka Trump brand, believing the action was unethical and a serious conflict of interest.\nLawmakers and public officials were quick to point out Conway’s possible legal flub on Twitter.
