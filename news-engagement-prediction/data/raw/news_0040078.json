apparently finished the job,' said the paper, referring to the woman seen wearing a top with LOL emblazoned on the front. Security camera footage reportedly shows the same woman wearing a dark-coloured glove on her left hand as she walked towards the taxi stand. By the time she reached the taxi area, she was no longer wearing the glove. There are suggestions that the glove might have been laced with poison when it was wiped across Kim's face. He had headed to the washroom immediately after the attack, but had then turned back to the information counter to seek help complaining of pain in his eyes. DID 'CARELESS' FACEBOOK USE LEAD TO KIM JONG-NAM'S DEATH? Kim Jong-Nam's 'careless' use of Facebook and emails may have led to his assassination, it has been reported. The 46-year-old half-brother of Kim Jong-un, poisoned to death by two female operatives in Kuala Lumpur, posted numerous pictures of himself online along with comments. His Facebook page was under the name 'Kim Chol', the same name used on the passport he had in his possession when he died on Monday. Kim Jong-Nam's 'careless' use of Facebook and emails may have led to his assassination, it has been reported. He is shown in one of his Facebook photos The 46-year-old half-brother of Kim Jong-un, poisoned to death by two female operatives in Kuala Lumpur, posted numerous pictures of himself online along with comments Jong-nam's Facebook profile shows a squirrel along with a French flag filter - possibly added in solidarity with Paris in the wake of the November 13 ISIS terror attacks South Korean intelligence chiefs say he was poisoned by agents from the North as he walked through Kuala Lumpur International Airport on his way to board a flight. Asian news websites are now reporting that the Facebook profile is that of the estranged relative of North Korea's dictator who had been living in exile in Macau. But a former intelligence secretary to South Korean President Lee Myung-bak claims that his 'careless' use of emails and social media may have prompted his assassination. Cha Du-hyeogn told NK News Jong-nam was known to have used commercial e-mail addresses to communicate. He said: 'Open activities like these do not look like they are coming from a person who is constantly under the death threats. A former intelligence secretary to South Korean President Lee Myung-bak claims that his 'careless' use of emails and social media may have prompted his assassination In 2010, he added another photo where he was posing in front of the five-star hotel Wynn Macau. He said of the image: 'Nice place!' His profile suggests he studied at the International School of Geneva and at the Lycée français de Moscou 'I think it is possible that Kim (Jong-nam) was careless, leading to his unsuspecting death.' Jong-nam's Facebook profile shows a squirrel along with a French flag filter - possibly added in solidarity with Paris in the wake of the November 13 ISIS terror attacks. One of his photos posted in October 2008, shows him standing on a yacht with an unknown man. Five years later he commented on the photo, saying: 'I miss Europe!' In 2010, he added another photo where he was posing in front of the five-star hotel Wynn Macau. He said of the image: 'Nice place!' His profile suggests he studied at the International School of Geneva and at the Lycée français de Moscou. A number of his Facebook friends use French language to comment on his photos. The paper said it had seen footage of Kim, who was wearing a dark blue polo T-shirt, light blue jeans and brown shoes, slumped in an armchair. 'His eyes were shut and he appeared to be grimacing in pain.' And in a startling claim the New Straits Times said it had been told there was a likelihood that one of the assailants who approached Kim - one from the front to distract him, the other to grab him around the throat from behind - was a man disguised as a woman. The paper said the man police might be looking for could be a 40-year-old agent from the North Korean intelligence agency known as the Reconnaissance General Bureau. It was reported that Kim had high blood pressure when he died. Following an autopsy, his tissue, urine and blood samples have been sent to a laboratory for analysis, which might take a week. Kim, 46, died on the way to hospital after telling staff at Kuala Lumpur International Airport that a woman had sprayed, or wiped, a liquid on his face. He had collapsed shortly after revealing the incident. Other new reports in Malaysia suggested today that the woman might have been duped by the four men and the other woman into playing the 'joke' on Kim, after which they had abandoned her. This might explain why, dressed in a white top bearing the letters LOL, she had turned up at the airport again a day later to catch a flight back to Vietnam, perhaps unaware that her 'prank' had proved to be an assassination. The Star newspaper said today that all six people had been staying at a hotel not far from the airport, but after the attack on Kim then others had abandoned her. It was then that she had decided to take a flight home. The woman, pictured on CCTV, has been arrested the suspect, has been named as 28-year-old Doan Thi Huong, of Vietnam, although Malaysian authorities believe it may be a false identity Kim Jong-nan, pictured, was half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and was open critical of his siblings regime 'Her story opens up the possibility that the other five had been the real killers who had planned the execution while the arrested woman was the pawn in their plot,' said The Star. North Korean diplomats tried to prevent pathologists carrying out an autopsy on Kim, perhaps because they feared that if it was found a poison had indeed killed him it could be traced back to Pyongyang. The post-mortem examination went ahead anyway, but the results have yet to be made public. Possible poisons are ricin, found in the seeds of castor oill plants, or tetrodotoxin, extracted from pufferfish. Ricin is slow acting, so it is less likely to have been used than tetrodotoxin, which can paralyse and kill victims quickly. Deputy Police Inspector-General Rashid Ibrahim said today that investigators were 'not ruling out the possibility that more suspects will be picked up in the coming days.' Her light blue Dior handbag, with its long strap slung over her left shoulder, was searched by police, who allegedly found a bottle containing a liquid that might have been the poison. JONG-NAM 'PLEADED FOR HIS LIFE TO BE SPARED' The half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un pleaded for his life to be spared after a failed assassination bid in 2012, lawmakers briefed by Seoul's spy chief have claimed. Jong-Nam, the eldest son of the late former leader Kim Jong-Il, was once seen as heir apparent but fell out of favour following an embarrassing botched bid in 2001 to enter Japan on a forged passport and visit Disneyland. He has since lived in virtual exile, mainly in the Chinese territory of Macau, while Jong-Un took over the isolated, nuclear-armed state after the death of his father in December 2011. The North in 2012 tried to assassinate Jong-Nam - known to be a supporter of reform in Pyongyang - Seoul lawmakers said following a closed-door briefing by the chief of the National Intelligence Service, Lee Byung-Ho. The half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un pleaded for his life to be spared after a failed assassination bid in 2012, lawmakers briefed by Seoul's spy chief said today 'According to (Lee)... there was one (assassination) bid in 2012, and Jong-Nam in April 2012 sent a letter to Jong-Un saying 'Please spare me and my family,'' Kim Byung-Kee, a member of the parliamentary intelligence committee, told reporters. 'It also said 'We have nowhere to go... we know that the only way to escape is suicide',' he said, adding Jong-Nam had little political support at home and posed little threat to Jong-Un. Jong-Nam's family - his former and current wives and three children - are currently living in Beijing and Macau, said another committee member, Lee Cheol-Woo. 'They are under the protection by the Chinese authorities,' he said, adding Jong-Nam had entered Malaysia on February 6, a week before his death. Jong-Nam's murder is the highest-profile death under the Kim Jong-Un's regime since the execution of the leader's uncle, Jang Song-Thaek, in December 2013. Jang, known to be close to China and an advocate of economic reform in the North, was charged with treason. Jong-Nam, believed to have ties with Beijing's elite, was a relatively outspoken figure, publicly criticising Pyongyang's political system. The 45-year-old said he 'personally opposed' the hereditary power transfer in his own family, during an interview with Japan's Asahi TV in 2010. One of his sons - Han-Sol - also described his uncle, Jong-Un, as a 'dictator' in a rare interview with a Finnish TV station in 2012 while he was studying in Europe. Kim Jong-nam had lived with the threat of death for years, since fleeing North Korea in fear of torture and execution. There had already been one botched attempt on his life. He travelled with bodyguards on his regular trips in Asia and occasionally Europe, usually on a false passport, in this case under the name of Kim Chol. But a brief lapse in his personal security between arriving at the airport and proceeding to passport control for his flight to Macau, where he lives in exile, left Kim Jong-nam alone, giving an assassin the chance to strike in the shopping concourse. One of the women is believed to have grabbed his face from behind — possibly placing a poison-laced handkerchief on his mouth — while the other sprayed toxic liquid on him or injected him with poison. According to U.S. sources, a 'fountain pen' may have been used — a device previously associated with North Korean assassinations. Former North Korean leader Kim Jong Il (bottom left) poses with his first-born son Kim Jong Nam (bottom right), in this 1981 family photo in Pyongyang, North Korea Kim Jong-Nam was once considered heir apparent but fell out of favour with his father Kim Jong-Il following a botched attempt in 2001 to enter Japan on a forged passport and visit Disneyland An agent arrested on a mission last year revealed how he was equipped by North Korean Intelligence with what looked like a Parker pen, but contained a retractable needle for administering a fatal dose of a toxin described as 'more potent than cyanide'. It caused muscle paralysis, breathlessness, suffocation and death, and was the method of choice for covert killings. Cheong Seong-Chang, of the independent Sejong Institute in Seoul, South Korea, said the assassination was 'unthinkable without a direct order or approval from Kim Jong-un himself'. Jong-nam's killing was probably motivated by a recent news report that he had sought to defect to the EU, the U.S. or South Korea as far back as 2012. 'LITTLE GENERAL' WHO FELL OUT OF FAVOUR WITH PYONGYANG They used to call him the 'Little General' but Kim Jong-Nam - once heir-apparent to his father and North Korea's then-leader Kim Jong-Il - fell from grace in 2001 after a spectacular blunder. On Tuesday, after more than a decade in exile from the North, Jong-Nam - the 45-year-old half-brother of current leader Kim Jong-Un - was widely reported by South Korean media to have been assassinated in Malaysia. Born from his father's relationship with actress Sung Hae-rim, Jong-Nam is known to have been a computer enthusiast, a fluent Japanese speaker and a student in both Russia and Switzerland. He lived in Pyongyang after finishing his overseas studies and was put in charge of overseeing North Korea's information technology policy. But the chubby eldest son of the supreme leader was already seen by Seoul experts as something of a political lightweight when in 2001 he fell out of favour. Jong-nam (pictured) was reportedly close to his uncle Jang Song-Thaek, once the North's unofficial number two and political mentor of the current leader He was embarrassingly detained at a Tokyo airport, trying to enter Japan to visit Disneyland on a false Dominican Republic passport, accompanied by two women and a child. Jong-Nam and his family afterwards lived in virtual exile in Macau, Singapore and China. Jong-Nam's half-brother Jong-Un took over as North Korean leader when their father died in December 2011. In an email exchange with a Japanese journalist published in 2012, Jong-Nam spoke disparagingly of Jong-Un, saying he lacked 'any sense of duty or seriousness' and warned that bribery and corruption would lead to North Korea's eventual collapse. In another exchange with the same reporter in 2012, Jong-Nam said: 'Anyone with normal thinking would find it difficult to tolerate three generations of hereditary succession.' Kim Jong-Nam was once dubbed the 'Little General', but fell out of favour with his father In October 2012 South Korean prosecutors said a North Korean detained as a spy had admitted involvement in a plot to stage a hit-and-run car accident in China in 2010 targeting Jong-Nam. In 2014 Jong-Nam was reported to be in Indonesia - sighted at an Italian restaurant run by a Japanese businessman in Jakarta - and was said to be shuttling back and forth between Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and France. In 2012 a Moscow newspaper reported that Jong-Nam was having financial problems after being cut off by the Stalinist state for doubting its succession policy. The Argumenty i Fakty weekly said he was kicked out of a luxury hotel in Macau over a $15,000 debt. Jong-Nam's son Kim Han-Sol studied at university in Paris. Back in 2012, when at school in Bosnia, he labelled his uncle Kim Jong-Un a 'dictator' in an interview. 'My dad (Jong-Nam) was not really interested in politics,' Kim told the interviewer when asked why his father was passed over for the dynastic succession in favour of his younger brother. Just days after the international condemnation of North Korea's 'game-changing' latest ballistic missile test, the assassination on foreign soil has prompted further outrage. Adding insult to injury, North Korean officials are attempting to block the autopsy on Jong-nam as they demand to take the body back to Pyongyang. For 33-year-old Kim Jong-un, the burial of his half-brother will bring to a triumphant end to a long-running saga of jealousy, paranoia and, ultimately, fratricide that would not have seemed out of place in Ancient Rome. Kim Jong-nam was once the heir apparent of North Korea, the eldest, albeit illegitimate, son of the 'Dear Leader', Kim Jong-il, by a South Korean actress (who died in mysterious circumstances in Moscow in 2002). His existence was kept secret by his father for many years, and he was not allowed to mix with his siblings from Kim Jong-il's other affairs and marriages. North Korean ambassador Kang Chol pictured inside the mortuary of the Kuala Lumpur Forensic Department. North Korea has ordered Malaysia to hand over the body A North Korea embassy official sits inside his car beside armed police outside a morgue at Kuala Lumpur General Hospital where Kim Jong-nam's body was taken However, he wanted for nothing, living in a mansion, surrounded by the latest toys from Europe and being driven on jaunts around the North Korean capital in a black Mercedes. At the age of ten he was sent abroad to study at the International School of Berne in Switzerland, where he became fluent in French. On his return to North Korea aged 17, Kim Jong-nam enrolled at a university. But his relationship with his father had deteriorated and he blamed his younger half-brother, Kim Jong-un, for taking advantage of his father's loneliness while he was out of the country. But Kim Jong-nam was a young man whose European experiences had filled him full of 'dangerous ideas', such as free market reforms to end rampant poverty and starvation in his home country. These suggestions outraged his father and caused apoplexy among the ruling elite. 'I was viewed with suspicion,' he admitted. The playboy half-brother of Kim Jong-Un (pictured, centre) was killed by two female assassins with poisoned needles at an airport in Malaysia, it has been claimed Reports, citing multiple government sources, said two women hailed a cab and fled immediately after Jong-nam fell sick His spell in Switzerland had also introduced him to life's luxuries — and to sex. Despite Japan being a sworn enemy of the regime, he would regularly fly to Tokyo using a false passport to indulge his playboy lifestyle in nightclubs, casinos and the city's red-light district. The tubby Korean, just 5ft 2in tall and weighing 14st, was a regular at an establishment known as Soap Land, where hostesses charge clients up to £300 an hour for their services. In 2001 he was caught in Tokyo on a false passport, on a trip to Japan's Disneyland. Retribution was swift and he was imprisoned for three days by his father before being banished from North Korea for ever. He lived in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and France, acquiring two wives and a son, before settling in the Chinese territor of Macau, where his lavish lifestyle was bankrolled by China — a huge power behind the scenes in North Korea. Beijing saw the exiled brother as a useful asset should they ever need to attempt to replace the 'Supreme Leader' with another member of the dynasty. When Kim Jong-un came to power in 2011 after the Dear Leader's death, his half-brother never lost an opportunity to attack his regime, claiming that without reforms North Korea would collapse and decrying the herditary transition of power, and he recklessly encouraged speculation that he could one day replace his half-brother. North Korea has so far made no comment about a murder that is making headlines around the world. Significantly, the death of a close relative of the ruling family in such strange circumstances has not merited a single word in the state-controlled media. THE ILLEGITIMATE CHILD OF A DICTATOR AND AN ACTRESS It was a secret affair that was so sensitive it was air-brushed from history in reclusive North Korea. Kim Jong-il, the country's late dictator started a relationship with married actress Song Hye-rim - a star of her time - in the 1960s. He wanted to keep the affair from his father and founder of North Korea's ruling dynasty Kim Il-Sung. But Jong-Il would go on to father a son with the actress in 1971, naming him Kim Jong-nam. Intelligence sources have verified reports of Kim Jong-il's liaisons with Song, Song Hye-rim, who died in exile in Russia in 2002. She was one of the country's first big movie stars, with legions of fans including film buff Kim Jong-il. Another star of the day, celebrated dancer Kim Young-soon - who escaped to South Korea in 2003 - has revealed how she was jailed for 'gossiping' about the affair. Kim Jong-Nam is pictured dressed in an army uniform as a child and posing with his maternal grandmother in January 1975. His mother was famed 1960s actress Song Hye-rim One day, she met Song who said she was moving into a place in Pyongyang called 'special residence number five' - a home reserved for the family of the ruling Kim clan. She knew what it meant. Her friend was to become Kim's wife. In other words, not only was Kim Jong-il forcing a woman six years older to divorce her husband to move in with him but, more riskily, he was rejecting the communist revolutionary his father had chosen for him to produce heirs for the ruling dynasty. Kim Young-soon became a criminal by repeating the story, losing her family, her privileged status and living for decades at the mercy of the North's security apparatus. She had not realised just how far Kim Jong-il would go to keep the relationship secret. Kim Jong-nam (pictured) was the illegitimate son of Kim Jong-Il and 1960s movie star Song Hye-rim In August 1970, Kim Young-soon was interrogated and forced to write her entire life story, including a line in one of the dozens of notebooks she filled about the conversation with Song. She later speculated an informant had tipped off security about the marriage and her written statement confirmed it. She was jailed for nine years and it was not until 10 years after she was released - after Kim Jong-il had apparently lost interest in Song - that she was told by a state security agent why she landed in prison. 'He told me that Song Hye-rim was not Kim Jong-il's wife and to forget what I might have heard about them having a child.' By that time, Kim Jong-il had two other sons with a former dancer named Ko Young-hee, including current dictator Kim Jong-un. 'Once Kim Jong-il took up with his new wife Ko Young-hee, (also known as Ko Yong-hui) they went on to erase any remembrance of Song Hye-rim,' Kim Young-soon said. Kim Jong Nam was quoted as saying in a 2012 book by a Japanese journalist: 'My father was keeping highly secret the fact that he was living with my mother who was married, a famous movie actress, so I couldn't get out of the house or make friends. 'That solitude from childhood may have made me what I am now, preferring freedom.'
