Photo: Reuters The Star/ANN Thursday, Feb 23, 2017 \nKUALA LUMPUR - Even the location of the office of Air Koryo seems to be a big question mark. \nThe North Korean airline has suddenly emerged on the public radar with the revelation by Malaysian police that one of its employees was a wanted man in the investigation into the death of Kim Jong-nam. \nAn employee of a virtual office hosting Air Koryo's representative office here refused to divulge information about the airline. \n\"No, it's not here,\" the male staff member at the reception area said, then shrugged and immediately shut the door when asked about Air Koryo yesterday. Photo: AsiaOne \nIt is learnt that the virtual office host, Worldwide Highsky Sdn Bhd, located along Jalan Ampang, had also taken off the Air Koryo sign, despite the airline being listed on a wall panel as one of 24 companies which the host services. \nIt is unknown whether the removal was done under the instruction of the airline representative or by the virtual office itself to avoid further media enquiries. \nWhen pressmen approached employees seen there, they gave a standard reply when asked about Air Koryo: \"No comment\". \nLater, a broadcast journalist from South Korea started to shoot videos of the office. \nRead Also: Kim Jong Nam's death: Doctors say no sign of heart attack or puncture marks \nThis prompted two receptionists working there to flee at once. \nEmployees of other offices in the building were surprised when asked if they had seen Air Koryo staff there. \n\"It was here? I never knew,\" a South Korean businessman said, looking surprised when told about the presence of the North Korean airline here. \nAnother Malaysian businessman who declined to be named said he was unaware about it too. \nTwo security guards and a cleaner approached said they had never seen any North Korean airline employee around. \nBased in Pyongyang, Air Koryo is the national flag carrier airline of North Korea. \nThe airline, which has a regional office here, is said to have an employee named Kim Uk-il, 37, who is wanted by police. \nHe is one of the seven remaining suspects in the murder case of Jong-nam.
