Credit Lynn Saville Thomas Lux , a poet who used spare, direct language to express the absurdities and sorrows of human life, and whose 1995 collection, “Split Horizons,” won the Kingsley Tufts Poetry Award, one of the most lucrative prizes in American poetry, died on Feb. 5 at his home in Atlanta. He was 70. The cause was lung cancer, said his wife, Jennifer Holley Lux. Mr. Lux showed a rare gift for blending comedy and disturbing surrealist images in his early collections “Memory’s Handgrenade” (1972), “The Glassblower’s Breath” (1976) and “Sunday: Poems” (1979). A character in the poem “Five Men I Knew” dreams he is reading “Duino Elegies” by Rilke “ aloud, / in German, at a racetrack in Florida,” when suddenly “the flamingos are drained of their color / and collapse.” His early manner, according to the reference work Contemporary Poets, was “tormented and tortured, full of complex and disjointed images reflecting an insane and inhospitable world.” With time, Mr. Lux gravitated toward a taut, precise realism, finding his subject matter in seemingly mundane events to which he applied an often comic twist, reflected in titles like “Attila the Hun Meets Pope Leo I” and “Like Tiny Baby Jesus, in Velour Pants, Sliding Down Your Throat (a Belgian Euphemism).” In “Refrigerator, 1957,” the depressing contents of a midcentury icebox — “boiled potato in a bag, a chicken carcass under foil” — give way to a wondrous jar of maraschino cherries, “heart red, sexual red, wet neon red, / shining red in their liquid.” In “Motel Seedy” he expressed the soul-destroying décor of a cheap hotel room: To put this color green — exhausted grave grass — to cinder blocks takes an understanding of loneliness and/or institutions that terrifies. In a 1999 interview with The Cortland Review , Mr. Lux said: “Making poems rhythmical and musical and believable as human speech and as distilled and tight as possible is very important to me. I started looking outside of myself a lot more for subjects.” His work was gathered in more than a dozen collections. Two compilation volumes were published in the mid-1990s — “The Blind Swimmer: Selected Early Poems, 1970-1975” and “New and Selected Poems: 1975-1995.” Thomas Norman Lux was born on Dec. 10, 1946, in Northampton, Mass., where he grew up on a dairy farm run by his grandfather and uncle. His father, Norman, delivered milk for the farm. His mother, the former Elinor Healey, answered telephones at a local Sears store. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
