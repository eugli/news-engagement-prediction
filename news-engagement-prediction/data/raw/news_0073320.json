Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nTheresa May's office has refused five times to send a message to 165,000 victims of a disability benefits shake-up. \nA Downing Street spokesman repeatedly ducked the question today as anger mounts over changes to Personal Independence Payment (PIP) - which helps disabled people with their day-to-day living costs. \nMinisters sneaked out emergency laws last week to stop 165,000 people getting more PIP, as recommended by two independent tribunals. \nCharities and Labour were outraged at the decision, which the government justified by saying expanding the scheme would have cost £3.7bn by 2022. \nYet today Downing Street insisted the changes \"haven't been brought in to make any savings\" - despite saying the benefit needed to be \"sustainable\".

No10 policy chief George Freeman expressed \"regret\" for his comments about the row (Photo: James Maloney) \nThe spokesman ducked questions on whether the Prime Minister thought those losing out were \"in need\" - or whether the tribunals were wrong. \nHe claimed the government was still committed to \"parity of esteem\" between mental and physical illness - despite warnings the move will hit the mentally ill. \nHe added: \"People aren't losing out from this. There is no cut to the PIP.\" \nThe exchange came minutes after Mrs May's No10 policy chief George Freeman expressed \"regret\" for saying the changes would ensure cash goes to the \"really disabled\". \nConditions expected to be affected include autism, dementia, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress and depression. The move specifically affects people who can't leave home alone without serious distress, or can't take their medication without help. \nHoping for a Tory rebellion, the Liberal Democrats today filed a bid in the House of Commons to block the emergency laws - which were not sent to the Social Security Advisory Committee watchdog for approval. \nLeader Tim Farron said the government is in \"real trouble\", adding: \"I am calling on Labour and Conservative backbenchers to sign this motion and help us block these deeply damaging cuts.\" The move affects people who can't go out without distress, or take medication alone (Photo: Rex Features) \nTory MP Heidi Allen, who has rebelled against previous government disability cuts, signalled she would join any attempt to block the law. \n\"The courts are there for a reason,\" she said. \n\"If they came up with this ruling that says this criteria should be expanded then I believe we have a duty to honour that.\" \nShe dismissed claims the victims were not in need, pointing out most of those hit can't go out alone due to \"overwhelming\" psychological distress. Tory MP Heidi Allen said: \"The courts are there for a reason\" \n\"That’s not the same as just being a bit uncomfortable. That sounds like somebody who suffers from severe mental health problems,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \nBen Harris-Quinney, chairman of the Bow Group - a Tory think tank - added: \"This is the very behaviour that gives the Conservative Party a bad name, attacking the most in need and kicking people when they are down.\" The exchange with 10 Downing Street in full \nJOURNALIST: What does the Prime Minister make of comments that people with autism and dementia aren't \"really disabled\"? \nNO10 SPOKESMAN: My understanding is that George Freeman has actually apologised this morning for the language he used around these payments. Obviously the government is committed to ensuring the welfare system is a strong safety net for those who are in need of it. Around £50bn a year is spent on supporting people with disabilities and health conditions which I think is around 6% of GDP. \nThere's 164,000 people affected who need help to go out alone so they don't suffer overwhelming distress. The other 1,000 need help to take medication. Are those people 'in need'? Is this simply a case of saving money? \nI think, you know, the government has been clear on the parity of esteem we want to see in terms of between mental and physical health. In terms of the PIP assessment criteria, these were developed in collaboration with disabled people and independent specialists and health and social care and disability to ensure the benefit is more responsive to the needs of those with mental health conditions. And the changes that were brought about are working. People with mental health conditions are receiving higher rates of both PIP components. \nSo, two tribunals said that those carefully-developed criteria were wrong. Does the government think those tribunals were wrong? Does the government have contempt for the tribunals? \nI think, you know, what we do, what we do now is sort of restoring the, erm, you know, the original, er, intention of, er, the PIPs, which was to ensure there was a sustainable benefit to provide continued support to those who face the greatest barriers to living independent lives. I would point out the actual spending on disability benefits has increased by £3bn since 2010. \nSo can I read from that there's naturally a trade-off between need and cost to the taxpayer here? \nThe point of these amendments is to restore the original aim of the policy. It's not been brought in to make any new savings. We're not going to see any - no claimant is going to see a reduction in the amount of PIP. \nWhat's the Prime Minister's message to the 150,000 disabled people who are losing out because of this? \nNobody is losing out because of this. There is no - the amendments haven't been brought in to make any savings. Nobody's going to see a reduction in the amount of PIP they receive. The point of these amendments is to restore the original aim of the policy which is to give a sustainable benefit to those with the greatest need. \nSo what's the Prime Minister's message to the 150,000 people who are no longer entitled to what they were entitled to a week ago? \nWhat the point of this is is to restore the original criteria. \nI know, but what's the message to-? \nThe tribunal sort of broadened out the way that assessment criteria are interpreted. So in effect, what this amendment does is just restore what the original PIP plan was. \nYes, I understand exactly what it does, but I'm asking what her message is to all the people losing out as a result. Does she not have a message? \nPeople aren't losing out from this. There is no cut to the PIP. \nSo no message of sympathy? Nothing? \nAs I say, nobody is losing out.
