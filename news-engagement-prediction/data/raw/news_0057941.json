Actually, it rarely is and Thursday night against visiting USC, Arizona got a slight preview of what’s to come on Saturday night when No. 5 UCLA comes to McKale Center.\nWhile USC likes to run, UCLA likes to sprint.\nAs Arizona coach Sean Miller said his team has to play with “effort and togetherness” and with so much more in order to get by UCLA, just as it did in its 90-77 win over the Trojans.\n“That’s what is so exciting to be able to play a team like them here for what’s at stake,” Miller said, in talking about Saturday’s game while looking back. “It’s an immense challenge and in order to beat them you really have to play great. That’s what we’re going to try and do.”\nKind of like it did Thursday night against USC where it was able to recover from an early deficit and then turn it on in the final five minutes of the first half and then continue its momentum in the second half.\nOn Thursday — Every. Player. Mattered.\nIf it wasn’t for Allonzo Trier’s season-high 25 points where would UA have been? Had it not been for Rawle Alkins’ 12 points and four assists could UA have pulled it off? How about Dusan Ristic’s 10 points and Lauri Markkanen’s 11 points and seven rebounds? And, well, how about Parker Jackson-Cartwright’s 10 points, five assists, two steals and, well, that big block late in the game? (more later on PJC)\n“We had a lot of players contribute and a lot of players step up,” Miller said.\nAllonzo Trier and Arizona's offense had a big night against USC Thursday at McKale Rick Scutari/AP The point is, Arizona is playing well – at least offensively – at the right time as it heads toward the end of the regular season and with the Pac-12 Conference tournament looking.\n“We had some good ball movement,” Miller said.\nThen he rattled off the numbers. And, boy, does he love numbers.\nArizona hit 11 of 20 3-pointers.\nIt went 15 for 17 from the free-throw line.\nIt had 16 assists to eight turnovers.\nSeven steals. And 10 second shots.\nArizona finished 32 for 63 from the field.\n“That’s a prolific offensive night,” he said. “I think we’re really happy. At times we played some really good defense and sometimes we didn’t. You’re only going to go as far as your excellence on both ends. It can’t just be one. We have to be good on both sides. To beat UCLA that’s going to be required.”\nTrier, who looks in midseason form but wants better from himself, agreed, saying UA needs to get better defensively and “we understand that.”\nHe later added: “We can’t try to play better defense, we have to play better defense. They (the Bruins) have the best offense in the country and it will be a challenge. We’re looking forward to it.”\nIn looking back, Miller said he knew it would be tough. USC is an NCAA tournament-worthy team and plays like it. In fact, USC had UA on its heels for the first 15 minutes before Arizona regrouped and took over.\n“Their pace caught us off guard,” Miller said. “We certainly had plenty of break downs and that’s to USC’s credit. They challenged our defense.”\nBut Arizona challenged theirs.\nAmong Arizona’s laundry-list of standouts, Miller was quick to point out his pint-sized point guard PJC, who started for the third consecutive time. He went 3 for 4 from beyond the 3-point line.\n“He wasn’t shooting the ball well for a long time,” Miller said. “I’ve never seen a player who shoots it as consistently as he shoots it every day not translate into a game. His recent play sparks our offense.”\nIt was the spark that Arizona needed, making sure Saturday’s game will be one of importance and perhaps one for the ages.\nRELATED: Arizona/USC postgame breakdown Edit", "external_links": ["https://res-5.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/jb2guufqqrwjegrqjp6v", "https://res-5.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/jb2guufqqrwjegrqjp6v)"], "published": "2017-02-24T08:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T06:52:09.837+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
