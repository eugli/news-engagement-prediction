Mix textures. \nThe key to nailing this trend is to make sure that you're mixing textures, so don't be afraid to pair a chiffon summer dress with a bulky shearling or a silky floral slip dress with an oversized wool military coat. The end result that comes from wearing a warm-weather piece of clothing with something that's meant specifically for chilly temperatures will make this outfit feel, in a word, cool .

Even that (with the right accessories) can work in the winter. If you'd prefer not to show excess skin, layer a turtleneck underneath. Facebook \n3. Break out your boots. \nMixing a floaty dress with a solid pair of boots is one of the easiest ways to nail the styling aspect of the trend. Over-the-knee suede boots, ankle boots, chunky lug soles—anything goes. PHOTO: Getty Images \n4. Don’t be afraid of color. \nYes, you're getting dressed in the middle of the winter, but resisting the urge to only wear black is what makes this trend stand out. Pastels, primary brights, stripes, florals—they all work, despite dated fashion \"rules.\" PHOTO: Timur Emek/Getty Images \n5. Top off your look with winter accessories. \nTo drive home the point that this look was, indeed, intentional and not a case of season-rushing, finish off your outfit with appropriate accessories like a slouchy beanie, an oversized scarf, or even a pair of jeans underneath. Besides scoring style points, you’ll also probably make your mom happy you bundled up. After all, it’s cold out there.
