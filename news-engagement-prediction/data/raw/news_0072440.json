Credit: ITV Wales A north Wales animal charity is being investigated by the Charity Commission after reports from members of the public.\nCapricorn Animal Rescue and Sanctuary, which is based near Mold, takes in animals that have no homes, are injured or neglected, and tries to rehouse them after they have recovered. The Charity Commission says it has received a number of complaints about Capricorn last year and it initially provided regulatory advice and gave trustees guidance on how to improve the charity's governance.\nThe commission monitored the charity’s compliance with this guidance and visited the charity in October 2016 and subsequently inspected the charity’s books and records. Our engagement established that there were clear and on-going serious regulatory issues relating to the administration of the charity by the trustees. These included inadequate financial controls, failure to safeguard and properly account for the charity’s assets, potential unauthorised trustee benefit and the trustees’ failure to act on regulatory advice.\n– Charity Commission statement An official inquiry, which was launched on February 9, will examine:\nthe administration, governance and management of the charity, whether there has been any unauthorised benefit to the charity's trustees, whether the trustees properly exercised their duties and responsibilities under charity law in the administration of the charity and in particular their duty to account for the charity's funds. The commission says that there have also been concerns about the welfare of animals at the site, which are outside its remit and should be directed to the RSPCA. A report will be published once the inquiry has concluded.\nLast updated Wed 22 Feb 2017 North Wales", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:23:09.317+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
