I repeatedly asked on what ground they were kicking me off the flight, no-one could give me an answer.\"\nMuslim teacher escorted off plane to US: 'Everyone was looking at me' Mr Miah said he has a British passport and does not have dual nationality. His family's ethnic background is Bangladeshi.\n\"I can't think why they wouldn't want me on the plane, apart from maybe because I'm a Muslim,\" he said.\nHe added that he had never been to any of the seven Muslim-majority countries included in an executive order signed by US President Donald Trump, temporarily barring people from those places.\nA federal judge in Seattle has since suspended the ban nationwide - a ruling which was later upheld at an appeals court hearing in San Francisco.\nMr Miah, who teaches maths at the 700-pupil school, said he was also denied access to the US Embassy in Reykjavik.\nHe said if he was not given a reason for what happened, he \"would like someone to put their hand up and say 'sorry, we made a mistake'.\"\nA council spokesman said: \"No satisfactory reason has been provided for refusing entry to the United States - either at the airport in Iceland or subsequently at the embassy.\n\"Understandably he feels belittled and upset at what appears to be an unjustified act of discrimination.\"\nThe Muslim Council Wales said it was \"deeply troubled\" by what had happened, adding that such incidents \"undermine equality and civil life\".\nThe Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it was \"providing support to a British man who was prevented from boarding a flight in Reykjavik\".", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1830C/production/_94748099_7f3adfbf-c2eb-47fc-b70e-f5e4f8710b40.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38927175"], "published": "2017-02-21T16:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:50:08.866+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
