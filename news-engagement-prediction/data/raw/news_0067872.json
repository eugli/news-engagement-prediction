Politics \nPerhaps the most shameful parents you'll ever see in public are politicians who drag their kids up on stage with them, or pose with them for the covers of women's magazines to soften their image. \nIt's bad enough the poor little sods have to live with you: don't publicly humiliate them by involving them in your sordid lifestyle. \nThey're never going to live this down, and may well get beaten up — which, if it causes their parents to stop staging photo-ops with them, is probably worth it. \nPoliticians who use their family for publicity purposes just come off as creepy anyway, rather than values-oriented. \nAs for ordinary citizens involving their kids in politics, I'll simply say this: if your child can't write their own placard for the protest march, leave them at home. 5. Sport \nWe're all familiar with the phenomenon of the nightmarish tennis parent: Damir Dokic, Stefano Capriati and Jim Pierce all became infamous for the intolerable pressure they placed on their children to succeed. \nWe consider men like that to be monsters, but at least they were making a fuss over games that mattered. Photo: Not pictured: A parent berates their child for running too slowly. (Pixabay.com) \nYour kid's weekend football couldn't matter less, so stop acting like every mistake they make is a hammer-blow to your eternal legacy. \nThe sight of a parent berating their child for dropping a ball or spraying a kick is nauseating and tells onlookers far more about how the parent's life and career are going than they intended. \nYou won't make your kid a better athlete through abuse: all you'll make them do is hate you. 6. Movies \nThe choice of what movies to take your kids to see should always involve the principles invoked regarding TV above. Photo: If your kids start making noise at the movies, shut them up. (Pixabay.com) \nBut the act of going to the movies involves some serious parental responsibility, to wit: shut your kids up. \nIf they start to make noise, stop them. If they won't stop, take them out of the theatre. I don't care if you'll miss the rest of the movie; you are ruining it for everyone. \nIdeally you will have instilled a sense of social responsibility and respect for others in your youngsters before you head to the cinema. \nBut if you haven't got around to that yet, you have got to at least be ready to threaten violence. In the end, I don't care how you do it, just shut. Your. Kids. Up. 7. Zoos \nA zoo is a wonderful place to teach children about the animal kingdom. A good parent will allow this teaching process to take place without shoving their ignorant fatheaded oar in. \nI once stood next to a man at the zoo who told his son that the lions were \"panthers\".

(Reuters: Cincinnati Zoo (file)) \nBefore you take your child to the zoo, you need to know two things: each animal's enclosure has a sign beside it containing interesting facts about the animal and — crucially — what the animal is called; and monkeys and apes are not the same thing. \nIf I had my way, anyone caught in a zoo telling their children that gorillas are monkeys would be banned for life and forced to do a course in zoology before they're allowed custody again. \nAs long as this law is not enacted, I simply implore all parents: if there's any chance you're a hopeless ignoramus, keep your mouth shut.
