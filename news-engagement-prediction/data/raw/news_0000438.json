She’s the reigning Miss Curvy Nigeria, a beauty cum modeling pageant for the plus-sized women. In this interview with Star Tracker, the graduate of University of Nigeria, Nsukka, who grew up in Edo State tells us why plus-sized models may be taking over from the traditional skinny models in the modelling business. \nBy AYO ONIKOYI, Entertainment editor \nYou are the winner of Miss Curvy 2015, what is it all about? \nIt has to do with discovering women who are plus- sized models. You don’t have to be very fat anyways, more of being curvy and be in shape and how you can actually rock your body. This is because most of these modeling agencies look out for people who are slim and skinny but we want to prove them wrong that we can do what the slim people can do with their body. \nWhat does being curvy means? \nIt is the look of an African woman. An African woman is not slim or skinny, she has a pronounced butt and hips. She is a complete woman. Gone are the days where we talk about slim women, we want to celebrate women with the African looks. \nWhat qualities gave you the crown in 2015? \nI wasn’t the curviest but we were in the camp for two weeks. There were other qualities they were looking out for at the camp; intellect, attitude towards others, among other things that make a queen. We were also given some tasks and were graded accordingly at the camp. \nAfter winning the crown, what has changed about you? \nA lot has changed about me. My perception about certain things has changed. I have met many people since then and the way I relate with people has also changed. I am now mindful of places I go to thereby reducing my outings. I don’t want to be seen just anywhere. The way people relate with me has also changed; people try to get closer to me now. Sandra Anthony \nWere you given a prize? \nYes, I was given a landed property in Ajah. Miss Curvy is also like Miss Nigeria where the tenure of a queen last for two years. \nCan you take us through your acting journey? \nI’ve done a couple of acting. The industry is a bit challenging. I might be on a location for weeks which means I have to suspend every other thing. \nYou seem to love flaunting your body, what do you think is special about your body? \nI like my eyes, lips, curves , height and everything about my looks. \nHas this brought you any trouble? \nI don’t think so. \nAre you in a relationship? \nI don’t discuss my personal life on the pages of the newspaper. \nWhat is the naughtiest thing a man has ever done to you? \nI get so many compliments from men that make me uncomfortable. \nWhat can make you fall in love with a man? \nI don’t talk about things like that. \nWhat’s your connection with “Lady’s hub”? \nI have a year contract to be their ambassador. As their ambassador, I have to advertise their product, talk about it to people and encourage people to visit their site. \nWhat do you think is the future of plus-sized modeling? \nWe don’t have only the slim people in the world. When having a fashion show and you only showcase slim girls, a plus-sized lady will not know what she will look like in such outfits. When you do an online shopping and you just advertise only slim girls, it means you are leaving out the big ones. \nDo you see plus-sized models taking over from the slim ones in the nearest future? \nI am not asking everybody to be slim but for every 10 women, you will get one plus-sized lady. I am not saying plus-sized models will take over the industry, I only want to see where plus-sized models would also be taken seriously. \nCan you ever consider going on a dieting programme to get very slim? \nNo, I don’t like being slim. You don’t have to be big but having flesh where necessary. \nMany people believe that slim ladies are sexier than the plus-sized ones, how true? \nThat’s not true. I’m sure you have heard about thick ladies. People get more attracted to plus sized ladies. The slim ones are undergoing surgery to add butts, they want to look like Nikky Minaj, Beyonce and the rest. \nSome men believe slim ladies are more active in bed than plus-sized, your take? \nI don’t know. \nModeling comes with doing the out of the ordinary things, can you go into nude modeling? \nI can’t do that unless I want to use it for my personal use. I mean I can’t do nude modeling for a brand. \nWho is your role model in the modeling industry? \nI love Kim Dashy, Naomi \nWhat can a man do to win your attention? \nHe needs to be himself and be a man. \nDo you believe in love or money? \nThey both go hand in hand. \nIf a man credits your account with a million naira, will you go on a date with him? \n(Laughs) That means the man is buying my love and attention. \nWhat was your growing up like? \nMy growing was okay, I got everything I wanted. I was the second to the last girl in the family.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T03:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:52:12.171+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
