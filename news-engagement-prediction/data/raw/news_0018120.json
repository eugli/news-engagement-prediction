Bala Murugan, 44, was taken into custody on Monday by police officers from the North Klang district police headquarters.\nHis family members claim that no explanation was given for his detention. \nAccording to lawyer Gerard Lazarus, Bala was only arrested because he was found with two other men, one of whom was wanted by the police. \n\"The police were actually aiming to arrest another guy, and Bala was with them in the car, so they arrested him as well. \n\"After they arrested him, they realised that Bala was 'Apoi' from Gang 18 over 20 years ago,\" Gerard on Wednesday. \nHe claimed that Bala was beaten while in detention and when brought to court to be remanded on Tuesday was bleeding severely from his mouth. \n\"When I tried to clean him up and asked him to drink some water, he ended up vomiting blood, and the magistrate saw all of this.\n\"That was when he called the investigating officer of the case and asked for Bala to be released or at least taken to the hospital immediately.\n\"The investigating officer agreed and said he would do so. However, police officers later told the family that they needed to take Bala to the police station first before releasing him,\" said Gerard.\nHe said that he was then informed by an inspector from the North Klang station that the head of investigation had ordered for Bala not to be released. \n\"The next thing, I received news that Bala was dead. I was told by a friend that the rumour (of his death) was ongoing in police WhatsApp groups. \n\"True enough at 6am today we got confirmation that Bala had died in custody and I found out that there was no report of a re-arrest, which means Bala was held illegally (after the magistrate ordered for him to be released) and he died in custody,\" said the lawyer.\nHe said Bala's younger brother had gone to the Tengku Ampuan Rahimah Hospital in Klang at 9am on Wednesday to identify the body.\n\"He said the face was badly bruised and was bloody but he was not allowed to see anything else.  He had all of three minutes to identify the body,\" Gerard said.\nHe said the family would lodge a police report on the case on Wednesday.\nGerard added that the family was not satisfied with the post-mortem which was conducted.\n\"They will not be claiming the remains and I will be filing for a second post-mortem to be carried out,\" he said.\nWhen contacted, a senior officer from the North Klang police headquarters said Bala's death was being investigated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T12:50:21.135+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
