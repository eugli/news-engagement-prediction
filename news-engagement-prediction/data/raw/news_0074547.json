More Obama administration policies will be tossed out. When the president addresses a joint session of Congress on Tuesday, Democrats will find almost nothing to cheer. (Some have busied themselves weighing the merits of shaking the president’s hand .) At the same time, the protests have left Republicans with a more urgent challenge as they seek to demonstrate the fruits of one-party control in the White House and on Capitol Hill: determining whether the fury directed at lawmakers is more than anecdotal, and how to react accordingly. Around every corner, it seemed, the resistance lurked last week, searching for a fresh target. Constituents swarmed safe Republican turf — in Tennessee and Iowa, Georgia and Montana — even packing a coffee shop in Fargo to heckle a North Dakota congressman who recently won re-election by 45 points.

One woman in Kentucky achieved a special kind of catharsis: shouting down Senator Mitch McConnell , the majority leader, over health coverage for coal miners. “ I hope you feel better now ,” Mr. McConnell said, smirking. The woman said she did. Perhaps most significant, Republicans have begun to acknowledge the depth of public concern about efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, a shift that could affect the prospects of their long-promised repeal. At a raucous town hall, Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, a fierce critic of the law, allowed that the measure “has helped Arkansans.” Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa said it was clear that the party had to proceed with care. “There’s more of a consensus among Republicans now that you got to be more cautious what you’re going to do,” he said after one spirited event. Others Republicans worried that their peers were beginning to lose their nerve. “There are, in my opinion, a significant number of congressmen who are being impacted by these kinds of protests, and their spine is a little bit weak,” Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama told a local radio station. “And I don’t know if we’re going to be able to repeal Obamacare now, because these folks who support Obamacare are very active. They’re putting pressure on congressmen, and there’s not a countereffort to steel the spine of some of these congressmen in tossup districts around the country.” Mr. Schumer noted that just weeks ago Senate Republicans had hoped to pick off red-state Democrats in their effort to overhaul the health care system. That talked has faded, at least somewhat. \n  He placed the odds of the health care law ’s survival at “significantly greater than 50 percent.” Looking further ahead, leaders of the Democratic Party , eager to harness the energy they have done little to generate themselves, say they are seeing uncharacteristic constituent interest in local races — including among citizens hoping to run as candidates themselves — at every level. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said it had held more than 100 “meetings or serious conversations” with potential recruits for the 2018 cycle. Since January, the group said, 1.2 million new people had been added to an online donor list. Officials predicted that this degree of engagement would persist, but at this point their confidence is born more of hope than long-term evidence.
