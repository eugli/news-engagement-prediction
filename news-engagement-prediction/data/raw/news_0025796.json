He knows the crowd is at the arena to watch hockey, but that doesn't mean he can't have some fun too. \nAfter Andrew Shaw and Torey Krug got into a fight during Sunday's game in Boston, McCauley put serious emphasis on \"FIGHTING\" during the penalty announcement. \nSeriously, this was remarkable. — Marina Molnar (@mkmolnar) February 13, 2017 \nBest of all, this wasn't even McCauley's best work. During the playoffs last year, he built up the anticipation with the most dramatic goal call we'll ever hear . — NHL on NBC (@NHLonNBCSports) March 29, 2016 \nNever change.
