Ruth Negga, nominated for her role in Loving , channeled the proverbial Queen of Hearts, topping her trademark close-cropped coif with a ruby tiara that was perfectly calibrated to her burgundy lips and eyes. Emma Stone tucked soft, coppery waves behind one bedecked ear, eyes edged in gold, lips coated in crimson, channeling the sirens of Old Hollywood.

The slick center part found fans in Jessica Biel and Naomie Harris, whose modern takes on glamour were red carpet standouts. And Best Actress nominee Isabelle Huppert elevated her aspirational brand of French insouciance with shimmering lids and a shoulder-spilling auburn mane offset by a gleaming silver ear cuff.
