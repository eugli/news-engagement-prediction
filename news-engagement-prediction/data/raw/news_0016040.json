The kit will consist of videos, audio recordings and background information on how to conduct three-minute mediation sessions during lessons.\nThe a £40,000-a-year co-educational school’s newly appointed director of creative learning, Thomas Godber, said: “Simple mindfulness techniques like asking children to feel themselves sitting in the chair, feel their feet and the sensation of their socks and shoes on their feet – this will allow them to concentrate and feel more relaxed.”\nHeadmaster Richard Cairns Credit: Paul Grover T he school has also bought over one hundred chairs on wheels, so that children more easily move around the classroom during lessons.\n“We are building experimental classrooms, where all the furniture will be on wheels,” Mr Godber said.\n“The chairs we have bought have a bit of give in the back so people can rock a bit as well.\n“We are throwing out some of the old, traditional notions that children have to sit in straight lines and listen for hours on end.”\nMr Godber, who was educated at three different Steiner schools, said the initiative “plays to the idea that children are naturally fidgety” and allows them to sit in different constellations during the course of the lesson.\nHe added: “It is tempting for teachers to say ‘sit still’. But young people have a lot of energy.\"\nThe flexible-backed wheely chairs, which were inspired by those used at schools in Singapore, will be introduced in a new block of classrooms that are being specially designed to accommodate creative learning techniques.\nEvery teacher in the school will be given a mindfulness kit F our cameras will be installed in each of the new classroom so that teachers can watch their lessons back, and view every corner of the classroom and reflect on the pupils' reaction to their lessons.\n“Often you think you know what is going on, but in the back row unbeknown to you children aren’t listening,” Mr Godber said.\n“Four different camera and microphones will be installed to capture crystal clear sound. I will encourage all teachers to use them.”\nLast Easter Mr Cairns led a delegation of teachers on a tour of schools in Finland, California and Singapore to research learning techniques.\nWe are throwing out some of the old, traditional notions that children have to sit in straight lines and listen for hours on end Thomas Godber, director of creative learning at Brighton College M r Cairns, who was named Tatler’s public school headmaster of the year in 2012, said: “I have always tried to create an education that looks forward rather than one that just tries to deliver the education I had at school. The purpose of my travels during the Easter break last year was to find examples of best practice globally.”\nIt is not the first time the school, funded in 1845, has introduced progressive measures. Last year Brighton College scrapped its uniform code in order to accommodate boys who identify as girls outside school and vice versa.\nIt was “reacting to a changing society which recognises that some children have gender dysphoria and do not wish to lose their emotional gender identities at school”.\n“Public schools are usually seen as bastions of conservatism but Brighton College feels it is time to break ranks,” the school said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T00:24:12.965+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
