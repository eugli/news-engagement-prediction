Madeline Buckley , madeline.buckley@indystar.com 3:31 p.m. ET Feb. 23, 2017 Parents pushing for resolution that affirms commitment to students regardless of immigration status Buy Photo (Photo: IndyStar) Buy Photo 1 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nRecently, Manny Martinez's two children have begun to tell him about their classmates' fears that their parents will be deported. \nHis boys, 9 and 5, attend Theodore Potter, a Spanish Immersion school on the city's east side. Martinez and his children are U.S. citizens. But in the school that has a student population that is a majority Hispanic or Latino, some classmates — or some of their parents are undocumented. \nAmid President Donald's Trump's efforts to toughen the country's immigration policies — which could mean more aggressive enforcement tactics and an increase in deportations — students and parents are uneasy. As the news stories and rhetoric trickles down to school children, Martinez said, the result is an untenable learning environment that leads to chronic absenteeism and fearful students. \n\"They're worried about their grandparents,\" Martinez said of the students. \"They're scared their parents aren't going to be home when they get home from school one day.\" \nMartinez hopes Indianapolis Public Schools will take a concrete step to ease the fears of students and parents Thursday night. The school board is expected to vote on a resolution that that would reaffirm the district's commitment to creating a safe and healthy environment for students, regardless of their immigration status. \nIf passed, the resolution, among other things, would affirm: The schools will continue their practice of not requiring social security numbers for enrolled or enrolling students. The schools will not ask students or parents about their immigration status. IPS employees will not assist immigration enforcement efforts unless they are legally required to do so. \n\"(The resolution) is calling on the district to step up and take more leadership in helping parents understand their rights, and do what they can to address fears,\" said Justin Ohlemiller, executive director of Stand for Children Indiana, an organization that has worked with families who fear deportation. \nParents are hesitant to fill out school documents, Martinez said, which in some cases means students are missing out on extracurricular activities, financial aid and other school opportunities. Martinez has pushed for the resolution, spurred to action on behalf of parents who do not want to draw attention to themselves due to their immigration status. \nHe hopes the resolution passes, and helps foster a better environment for students. \n\"Students and parents would become more involved and have less fear,\" Martinez said. \nIPS Superintendent Lewis Ferebee has already signaled some support by signing a petition that asks elected officials to protect law-abiding students, graduates and teachers from the threat of deportation. The petition has been signed by more than 2,000 education leaders, including superintendents of school districts in Houston, Denver and Baltimore. \nThe petition was also signed by IPS Board of School Commissioners president Mary Ann Sullivan. \nIPS is not the only district to consider such a resolution. Chicago Public Schools officials on Tuesday told principals to not allow immigration authorities on school property without a warrant. \nThe district has already undertaken some educational initiatives for teachers, parents and families. \nLast week, the district hosted a \"Know your Rights\" forum to prepare parents for incidents such as immigration raids, said Jessica Feeser coordinator of the IPS English as a Second Language program. It has also brought in immigration attorneys, as well as a staff member from Catholic Charities, to educate staff members. \n\"We want them to be equipped with the facts,\" Feeser said. \"We also want students to know they are welcomed and loved.\" \nCall Star reporter Madeline Buckley at (317) 444-6083.
