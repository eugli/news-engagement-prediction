You can shake your doormat, however, but only before 8am in the morning.\nYou can wear anything to Parliament... except a suit of armour (Photo: PA) Causing a nuclear meltdown Quite rightly it is illegal under the terms of the Prohibition and Inspections Act of 1998 to cause a nuclear explosion.\nActing a bit fishy with some salmon It's illegal to handle salmon in suspicious circumstances, according to the Salmon Act of 1986.\nWhile this is clearly related to selling fish gained through illicit means, the law is oddly broad in its wording.\nSetting an alarm without leaving a key nearby It is an offence under a provision of the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 to leave your property with a burglar alarm activated, unless you have named a “key-holder” responsible for shutting it off if you are away.\nRead More UK wages will rise 2.5% in 2017 despite Brexit impact, claim experts Beeping your car horn in anger It is a commonly-held belief that a horn should not be sounded when stationary on a road at any time, other than at times of danger due to another vehicle on or near the road.\nBut, in fact, the law says: ”A horn should only be used when warning someone of danger, not to indicate your annoyance at a manner of driving” … whether or not the car is parked.\nA horn should only be used when warning someone of danger (Photo: Mirrorpix) Jumping the queue when buying a tube ticket Under the terms of a bye-law, it is illegal to “jump” the queue in the tube ticket hall.\nAny person directed by a notice to queue (or when asked to queue by an authorised person) shall join the rear of the queue and obey the reasonable instructions of any authorised person.\n  Politics Newsletter Follow @DailyMirror Subscribe to our Politics   Comments Show more comments More On Easter Houses of Parliament Brexit Minimum wage Burglary Politics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T05:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:26:21.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
