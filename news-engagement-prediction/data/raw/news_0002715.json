Article continues below \nEngland's top order began to make strides towards the target when they took to the middle, with useful contributions from Morgan, Joe Root, and Jason Roy, but the chase soon fell apart completely. \nYuzvendra Chahal's legspin was the main downfall of the England batsman as he took a brilliant 6-25 as the tourists lost their final eight wickets for just 8 runs. A staggering collapse that began on 119-2 and ended with Jasprit Bumrah's dismissals of Liam Plunkett and Tymal Mills leaving England 127 all out in just 16.3 overs. Article continues below Adam Lallana reveals exactly what he eats in 24 hours - and it's ridiculous \nThe win means India have defeated England in the test, one day international and t20 series this winter. \nAnd, it appears as though England's most vocal celebrity fan has identified a solution to the lack of batting success in recent games. \nHere's what Piers Morgan had to say following the loss: \nObviously Piers, and many other England fans, would love to see Kevin Pietersen return to international cricket but that ship has long sailed and really it's time to move on. \nPietersen has expressed desire to play for England again but the 36-year-old's exile is not likely to end anytime soon with the same ECB hierarchy in place that cast him into the wilderness over three years ago now. \nMorgan has always been a rather boisterous fan on social media and often expresses his desire for Pietersen to return to the national scene, but come on Piers, even you must recognise one man wouldn't have flipped the series' results on their head! \nEngland have simply been outplayed by a superior team this winter in all formats, and there is no shame in that as this current crop of Indian players is a special one that could dominate world cricket for the next few years, particularly in their home conditions. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
