I will use the Herzberg award to help perpetuate excellence in battery research at Dalhousie University long after my own retirement,” Dahn said in a statement. \nDahn was born in Bridgeport, Conn., and moved to Nova Scotia in 1970 with his family. \nThe university says it is the third time in four years that a Dalhousie researcher has won the Herzberg prize. Dahn also won the Governor General’s Innovation Award last year. © 2017 The Canadian Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T19:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T03:06:53.373+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
