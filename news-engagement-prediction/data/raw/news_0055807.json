This video helps to explain why. Advertisement \nPart of the reason is triage: the concept of sorting people according to how time-sensitive their problem is. Even if you have a serious illness or injury, if you’re unlikely to get worse in the next few hours, you won’t be at the top of the list. “First come, first served” doesn’t apply here—the person who walks in an hour after you might see the doctor before you do. \nAnother part of the reason is simply that the emergency department is connected to the rest of the hospital.
