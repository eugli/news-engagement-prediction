Key points: Hundreds of volunteers had just re-floated scores of stranded whales when the second group became stranded About 100 surviving whales were re-floated with volunteers forming a human chain to prevent them beaching again Farewell spit has been the site of several previous mass-strandings \nIn total, more than 650 pilot whales have beached themselves along a five-kilometre stretch of coastline over two days on Farewell Spit at the tip of the South Island. \nAbout 335 of the whales are dead, 220 remain stranded, and 100 are back at sea. \nDepartment of Conservation Golden Bay Operations Manager Andrew Lamason said they are sure they are dealing with a new pod because they had tagged all the re-floated whales from the first group and none of the new group had tags. \nThe news was devastating for hundreds of volunteers who had come from around the country to help with the initial group of 416 stranded whales that was found early Friday , many of them already dead.

Macabre clean up \nOfficials will soon need to turn to the grim task of disposing of hundreds of carcasses. \nLamason said one option was to tether the carcasses to stakes or a boat in the shallow tidal waters and let them decompose. \nThe problem with towing them out to sea or leaving them was that they could become gaseous and buoyant, and end up causing problems by floating into populated bays. \nFarewell Spit, a sliver of sand that arches like a hook into the Tasman Sea, has been the site of previous mass strandings. Sometimes described as a whale trap, the spit's long coastline and gently sloping beaches seem to make it difficult for whales to navigate away from once they get close. \nAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T17:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T12:51:47.756+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
