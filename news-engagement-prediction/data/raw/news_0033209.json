What's the real story behind The Moorside? (Photo: BBC) But what was the real story behind The Moorside? \nShannon Matthews was reported missing on the afternoon of 19 February 2008 in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, England when she was aged nine years old. \nLed by Detective Superintendent Andy Brennan, the search for her became a major missing person police operation and was even compared to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. \nThe West Yorkshire Police questioned 1,500 motorists and searched 3,000 houses. \nBy 5 March, more than 250 officers and 60 detectives were involved in the investigation, about 10% of the West Yorkshire force's operational strength.

Karen has been released from prison since (Photo: Phil Spencer) \nShe was given a new name for use in public, although authorities did not consider her mentally capable of maintaining a completely new identity and she will retain her real name for engagement with officials. \nMeanwhile, Shannon was placed under police protection and cared for by the social services. \nShe ceased to be subject to police protection on 17 March 2008, and, since then, she has remained in the care of Kirklees Family Services on a voluntary basis. \nOn 15 March the police reported that Shannon Matthews had begun to recover after her ordeal, with specially-trained officers questioning her to establish what had happened. \n*The Moorside concluded on BBC One tonight at 9pm Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T03:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T23:02:47.528+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
