She described it as a “very difficult time,” but also said that they will always be a family. \nAngelina did not want to say much, but at the end of all this, she just hopes that it makes them a stronger family. “Many, many people find themselves in this situation,” she said when interviewer Yalda Hakim asked her about how she’s coping. “My whole, my family… we’ve all been through a difficult time. My focus is my children, our children… and my focus is finding this way through. We are and forever will be a family. I am coping with finding a way through to make sure that this somehow makes us stronger and closer. It’s been a difficult few months.” \nAngelina, Brad, and their kids have been through a rough four to five months since the announcement of the divorce. There were talks about Brad’s parenting style , the women involved in his life , and even an incident that happened inside a plane with the kids . Since then, the couple has decided to deal with their divorce privately.
