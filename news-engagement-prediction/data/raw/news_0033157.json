Others among them say that Syonan was a painful fact of history, and we should call it what it was.”\nThe gallery, which was formerly known as Memories at Old Ford Factory, was renamed after a year-long revamp by the National Archives of Singapore (NAS). To date, it has received more than 400 public donations , with items ranging from personal letters, diaries and photographs to war artefacts and maps.\n“The reactions show us how indelible an imprint those three-and-a-half years had left on their lives and on Singapore,” added Dr Yaacob. “Younger Singaporeans did not have the same indelible life experience as their parents and grandparents. But I hope this gallery will give them a sense of what it was like to live through that dark period, and inspire all of us to build and defend our nation.”\nDr Yaacob also said the exhibition, which captures the dark and painful years after Singapore fell, reminds Singaporeans to \"ever again take our peace, harmony and sovereignty for granted.\"\nThe Minister added that terrorism continues to be a significant threat facing the world today, as he cited incidents in Orlando, Paris, Nice, Sydney and Jakarta that occurred last year.\n“Today, threats and challenges to our way of life continue to come in all shapes and sizes, and in increasingly diverse forms,” he said. “The true test of having remembered and learnt the lessons of war is that we live lives of courage and of resilience, every day, today. Far beyond having a strong defence force, we need to all do our part to build community, and to build harmony.\"\nA traditional weapon presentation ceremony was also held for the Singapore Armed Forces recruits from the 2nd Battalion, Singapore Infantry Regiment at the former Ford Factory to “demonstrate the young soldiers’ commitment to defence”, the Ministry of Defence said.\nThe building was gazetted as a national monument in 2006.\n- CNA/xk\nEmail More", "external_links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=#&title=&summary=&source="], "published": "2017-02-15T21:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T08:01:31.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
