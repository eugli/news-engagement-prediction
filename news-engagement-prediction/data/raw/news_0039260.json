We are well aware that the only way to escape is suicide,” Kim Jong-nam said in a letter to Kim Jong-un , one of the lawmakers said.\nKim Jong-nam was assassinated. But was it on his brother’s orders? | Aidan Foster-Carter Read more \nKim Jong-nam, 46, died after an attack , possibly with poison, at Kuala Lumpur airport on Monday. US and South Korean government officials have said they believe he was assassinated by agents from the North.\nThe eldest son of Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-nam was hidden from public view for years because his father and actress mother were not legally married. He was not shown to his grandfather, North Korea’s founding president Kim Il-sung, until he was five years old.\nKim Jong-nam spent nine years at an international school in Geneva.\nWhen he returned to Pyongyang, he joined the government. His father became leader in 1994 and Kim Jong-nam was expected by some eventually to succeed him.\nHowever, in May 2001, Kim Jong-nam was held at Tokyo’s Narita airport for using a false Dominican Republic passport. He was accompanied by his wife, another woman believed to be a nanny, and a four-year-old boy, his son, according to media reports.\nHe said the family wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland. All four were deported and went back to North Korea via Beijing.\nHis father was embarrassed and after that, Kim Jong-nam’s star was on the wane.\nKim Jong-nam’s mother Song Hye Rim ended up living in Moscow, away from him, and died there after struggling with depression for years. Kim said he often visited the mother’s grave in Moscow.\nAfter the Disneyland incident, much of the rest of Kim Jong Nam’s life was spent overseas, first in China and then in Macau.\n\nSouth Korea’s intelligence service said he had wives and children both in Beijing and Macau, according to lawmakers.\n“Because I was educated in the west, I was able to enjoy freedom from early age and I still love being free,” he said in notes to a Japanese journalist, Yoji Gomi, who wrote a book on Kim Jong-nam in 2012. “The reason I visit Macau so often is because it’s the most free and liberal place near China, where my family lives.\nSouth Korean politicians said the spy agency told them that young, unpredictable Kim Jong-un had issued a “standing order” for his half-brother’s assassination after he took power, and that there had been a failed attempt in 2012.\n“Kim Jong-un said: ‘I just hate him. So get rid of him,’” Kim Byung-kee, one of the lawmakers, cited the spy agency as saying about the standing order.\nSome analysts have said Jong-un believed his brother could be used in any overthrow of his regime.\nAfter that, Kim Jong-nam did not stay long in any place, and travelled frequently between various cities in south-east Asia and China.\nNorth Korean spy chief sacked in latest purge, says South Korea Read more \nKim Jong-nam had not kept his disdain for his brother a secret.\n“I’m his half-brother, but I’ve never met him so I don’t know,” he said in another note to Gomi.\n“I’m concerned how Jong-un, who merely resembles my grandfather, will be able to satisfy the needs of North Koreans. Kim Jong-un is still just a nominal figure and the members of the power elite will be the ones in actual power. The dynastic succession is a joke to the outside world.“\nHe added: “The Kim Jong-un regime will not last long. Without reforms, North Korea will collapse, and when such changes take place, the regime will collapse.“\nNumerous North Korean officials have been purged or killed since Kim Jong-un came to power. Those include his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, who was considered the country’s second most-powerful person and was believed to have been close to Kim Jong-nam, who he had helped raise.\n“I was raised getting special love from the aunt and uncle and I am not denying that they are even now taking special care of me,” Kim Jong-nam said in a note written to Gomi before his uncle was killed .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T08:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T04:14:26.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
