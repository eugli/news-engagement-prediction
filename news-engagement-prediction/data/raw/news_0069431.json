Mariah Carey knows people are going to ask her about New Year’s Eve and her now well-known disastrous performance in Times Square. So, when Rolling Stone brought up the infamous night during a new interview , she got right to the point about what she described as a “chaotic mess.” \"This was out of my control, and had everything not been such a total chaotic mess, then I would have been able to make something happen,” she told the magazine. Carey’s team placed the blame on Dick Clark Productions for reportedly not taking action after learning that Carey’s in-ear monitors didn’t work. In her comments to Rolling Stone, Carey said that many players could have stepped in that night when they realized something had gone awry. “Even the dancers should have stopped dancing and helped me off the fucking stage,” she said. “I'm sorry. It was a mess, and I blame everybody, and I blame myself for not leaving after rehearsal.” When Vanity Fair spoke to Carey’s manager Stella Bulochnikov on a call last month, she said that D.C.P. could have intervened to distract from Carey’s onstage mishap and cut the camera to another scene. “I'm saying that once it happened there were handfuls of things they could have done to fix it,” she said, “But to keep the cameras rolling? It’s like a bad scene from Anchorman, like when Will Ferrell is like, ‘Stay on the car chase.’ It's not cool.” Dick Clark Productions denied involvement in Carey’s flubbed performance, releasing its comments in a statement obtained by Billboard , following New Year’s Eve. “As the premier producer of live television events for nearly 50 years, we pride ourselves on our reputation and long-standing relationships with artists. To suggest that D.C.P., as producer of music shows including the American Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards, New Year’s Rockin’ Eve, and Academy of Country Music Awards, would ever intentionally compromise the success of any artist is defamatory, outrageous and frankly absurd.” Carey has since moved on from the debacle. She performed a new single on Jimmy Kimmel Live last week and is preparing for a tour with Lionel Richie next month. 1 / 8 Instagrams of the Rich and Egocentric: James Franco’s Little Mermaid Party, Mariah Carey’s Stripper Heels Justin Bieber Now if Jay-Z ever quotes Justin Bieber, the universe will have come full circle.
