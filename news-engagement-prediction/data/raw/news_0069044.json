What should you do? Hook it out of their mouth or pat their back? \nSadly, some parents are faced with even more serious issues than a bit of fruit going down the wrong way - \nChannel Mum has teamed up with St John Ambulance to launch a first aid course for parents, releasing a series of videos to inform mums and dads of what to do in an emergency situation. \nOver 60 children die in accidents in the home every year – but a quarter of parents have NO first aid knowledge whatsoever. \nA new study of 2,000 parents reveals millions of children’s lives are at risk because their mums and dads don’t have the appropriate life-saving skills.
