One said of the keep fit fanatic, who ran a building firm: 'Gutted to hear about Daryl Bhandal. My thoughts are with his family and friends. RIP mate.' Graphic designer Brad Mulock added: 'Daryl Bhandal. Unbelievable. Totally and utterly unbelievable. RIP mate.' Friends took to social media to pay tribute to Mr Bhandal, from Woolwich, south east London, today Friend Richard Specter said: 'RIP Daryl Bhandal. Absolute pleasure knowing you. Top bloke and a brilliant father. I know a lot of us are in shock and rightfully so. 'And for everyone paying tributes, I'm sure it'll be a huge comfort to his family to know he'll be missed by so many people. Sleep tight big guy.' Another Facebook post, written before the tragedy in the early hours of Saturday morning, revealed how Mr Bhandal had gone out with his young son and daughter on Boxing Day to hand out warm clothes to the homeless. Quality Solutions Group, the firm he was a director of, said it was footing the bill for all the clothes. Police on the island were not immediately available this morning to comment on the two arrests. The man detained over Mr Bhandal's death, who was reportedly held by local police as he tried to flee the scene, is understood to have received hospital treatment for minor facial injuries. His partner was held on suspicion of throwing the wet floor sign at Daryl during a verbal row which led to the violent altercation. The British building firm director was rushed to a hospital in the south of the island with severe head injuries but died around 3am on Saturday morning. A local judge has been put in charge of the case.
