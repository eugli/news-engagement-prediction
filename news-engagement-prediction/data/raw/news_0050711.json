The Samsung Galaxy S8 was already rumored to cost more than last year’s flagship from Samsung based on a leaked image from a Ukrainian retailer , so although it hasn’t been confirmed yet, a rumor from a different source would seem to suggest that Samsung is planning to launch the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus at a higher cost than last year’s phones. If true, this could be due to any number of reasons, although there is no way to know for sure if the costs will actually increase or if they will increase in every single region where Samsung is planning to launch the device. \nAccording to the tweet, which comes from a user named @mmddj_china, the Samsung Galaxy S8 will cost about 6088RMB in China which is around the cost of $887 USD. Keeping this in mind, the conversion rates are generally not an exact reflection of how much the cost will be, so if the price of the Galaxy S8 in China is correct or even close to that amount, chances are that the U.S. version will be a little bit more or a little bit less, but it’s not likely that it would be exactly $887 or $886.40 which is the exact conversion rate for 6088RMB. \nAnother thing to consider is that even if the cost of the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus is higher than last year’s Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge, the phone’s actual price in each region will also vary by retailer, and each wireless carrier is likely to have a price for each phone that is slightly different from other carriers, though probably not by a vast amount. Samsung has confirmed that they would not be unveiling the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus at this year’s Mobile World Congress so it will still be a little while before the official costs are known, but Samsung is rumored to be unveiling the launch date for the Galaxy S8 at their press conference, which may give people an idea of when to expect information from them on the price.
