The administration’s lawyers are asking an appeals court to lift a lower judge’s restraining order that has defanged most of Mr. Trump’s Jan. 27 executive order imposing the new vetting policy. The lawyers said immigration law gives Mr. Trump expansive powers to decide whom to let into the U.S. and whom to block, and said that while people who reach the U.S. do have some rights, those who are applying from overseas have no claims. They also said the State Department has the power, “at any time,” to revoke visas, and foreigners don’t even have a legal right to go to court. “Aliens outside the United States have no due process rights with respect to their attempt to gain entry into this country,” the lawyers wrote. They were responding to a challenge brought by Washington and Minnesota, states that have argued businesses, colleges and residents within their borders were being hurt by the Trump vetting policy. \nThe 9th Circuit Court of Appeals will consider the arguments of both parties more fully at 3 p.m. PST Tuesday, when a three-judge panel scheduled oral arguments to be heard by phone in the case. \nThe panel of judges set to hear arguments and consider whether to keep the executive order on hold are William Canby Jr., an appointee of President Carter; Richard Clifton, an appointee of President George W. Bush; and Michelle T. Friedland, an appointee of President Obama. \nMr. Trump’s executive order imposes a 90-day halt on visitors from seven majority-Muslim nations, and a 120-halt on the U.S. refugee program. That policy imposes a 90-day halt on visitors from seven majority-Muslim nations, and a 120-day halt on the U.S. refugee program. Judge James L. Robart on Friday sided with the states, saying Mr. Trump likely overstepped his powers — though the judge didn’t provide any detailed legal analysis of his decision. The Trump administration asked a federal appeals court over the weekend to stay Judge Robart’s ruling but that court declined, instead ordering a speedy briefing schedule. The states filed their brief Sunday and the Trump administration replied Monday night. Trump lawyers said national security is at stake. They said Mr. Trump made a judgment that current screening procedures aren’t good enough to weed out potential terrorists, and the pause gives the government a chance to improve its vetting. The halt on visitors from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Libya and Yemen expires in 90 days , while the halt on refugees lasts 120 days. The one exception is Syrian refugees, who are blocked indefinitely. “The potential national-security risks and harms resulting from the compelled application of procedures that the president has determined must be reexamined, for the purpose of ensuring an adequate measure of protection for the nation, cannot be undone. Nor can the effect on our constitutional separation of powers,” the lawyers said. Even if some states are harmed by the vetting policy, the administration lawyers said Judge Robart’s ruling should have been limited only to states that complained. The case has become a major test of the extent of presidential powers when it comes to immigration. It’s also serving as an early test for the political forces vowing to resist Mr. Trump, many of whom have filed briefs in the case siding with opponents of the president. Ten former top U.S. security officials and diplomats called the executive order an “ill-conceived, poorly implemented and ill-explained” plan that “could do long-term damage” to American national security and foreign policy interests. The ban could harm American interests by endangering U.S. troops abroad, serving as a recruitment tool for the Islamic State, and undermining relationships between American Muslim communities and local law enforcement, wrote the coalition of former officials including Madeleine K. Albright, Avril D. Haines, Michael V. Hayden, John F. Kerry, John E. McLaughlin, Lisa O. Monaco, Michael J. Morell, Janet A. Napolitano, Leon E. Panetta and Susan E. Rice. Nearly 100 technology companies, including Apple, Google and Microsoft, also filed an amicus brief in opposition to the order, arguing that it “inflicts significant harm on American business, innovation, and growth.” Attorneys general from 15 states and Washington, D.C., argued that businesses, tourism, medical institutions, and universities were harmed by the order. In one example highlighted in the brief, the attorneys general wrote that nearly 1,000 citizens from from the affected countries were studying in New York on temporary visas in 2015 and collectively contributed $30.4 million — through tuition payments and living expenses — to the state’s economy. Dozens of law professors also filed an amicus brief, arguing that not only would American universities be harmed by a travel ban that would keep thousands of students from traveling to the United States for school but that the executive order constituted a violation of nonimmigrants’ due process rights and a violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Administrative Procedure Act. “Nonimmigrants who have been granted visas and are already living in the United States have due process rights to stay here; those who are abroad have a due process interest in proper adjudication of their rights to be in the United States,” the law professors wrote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T06:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:48:54.233+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
