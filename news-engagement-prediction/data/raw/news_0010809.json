Did the shots kick in? \nDid she forget her room number and they name of the bloke she’d just met and married? \nWas it cold feet? \nOr does Lauren from the Shire — the bride who did the bolt on national television — just really like tall guys? \nThat’s one of the theories from the Andrew, the reality TV groom whose new “wife” left him high and dry at a pub after their Married At First Sight wedding. \nMarried At First Sight psychologist says the bride comes clean in an upcoming episode of the show but says basically the bride was “overwhelmed” by the day and commitment to a man she had onyl just met. \nHowever Andrew, the blindsided groom, is adamant he saw no sign of that. \nAndrew thought he and his new bride were getting along famously ... right up until she ghosted from the bar they were drinking at after their nuptials. \nHe’s still searching for answers, telling TheFix he has ”no idea” how it all went so pear-shaped. \nHowever he did venture his theories on her shock disappearance, saying he suspected he wasn’t her “ideal look”, and that may have played a role in her decision to go AWOL leaving all her belongings in their hotel room. \n“She does like tall guys. I go between 5-foot-11-and-three-quarters and 6-foot. In heels, she would tower over me,” he said. “Maybe she just likes tall guys”: blindsided groom Andrew.

We both had a really good time,” said the 38-year-old firefighter. \nHe said his new “wife” gave him no hint of the disappearing act to come, progressing from ceremony, to reception, and back to the hotel where the pair changed before heading out to a local pub to continue the celebrations. \nLauren was nervous about telling him she had an 11-year-old-son, but they’d moved past that, and had even managed a few kisses ahead of their ill-fated late-night bar hop. \n“I turned around and Lauren had vanished ... she was gone ... didn’t say goodbye, didn’t say whether she was going and that was literally the last that I spoke to her,” Andrew said. \nA confused Andrew went back to the room hoping she would return but woke in an empty bed even after multiple calls to Lauren’s mobile — which went unanswered. \nThe hunt for Lauren is set to play out tonight with Married At First Sight ’s relationship experts as eager as Andrew to get their hands on Lauren for a full explanation. \nLauren has some explaining to do, Dr Aiken told the Today show. \n“We test them, we interview them, we put all their results together and we put them forward ... what we can never predict is how they’re going to cope when they lock eyes on each other at the altar,” he said. \n“With Lauren, basically it became way too overwhelming for her. Also as solo mum, I’m not sure that she really knew what she was getting herself into.” \nLauren explains herself when he gets the duo together in an episode to play out on Tuesday night. \n“I get them together, and she’s going to really come clean as to what went on. ... but it was really overwhelming,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T02:31:17.415+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
