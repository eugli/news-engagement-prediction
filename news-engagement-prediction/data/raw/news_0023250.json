Isaiah J. Downing/Isaiah J. Downing-USA TODAY Sports Feb 9, 2017 at 3:18p ET 0Shares \nMinnesota Wild captain Mikko Koivu says body language and rebound control are two of the keys to goalie Devan Dubnyk’s success. \nKoivu opined on Dubnyk’s recent dominance in an essay for the Players’ Tribune , noting that — from his perspective as a defensive-oriented forward — Dubnyk’s calmness can boost the team’s spirits on the ice. \n“When you’re scrambling on a penalty kill, or pinned in your own end, and you look back and see your goalie make a calm, collected save, it gives you so much confidence,” Koivu said. “…it makes a big difference.” \nHis control, Koivu said, sometimes leads to rebounds that look more like passes. \n“When an opposing player takes a shot, he knows exactly where we want the rebound,” Koivu said. “He knows where our defenders are and where to send the puck after it’s been shot at him.” \nThe piece also digs into Koivu’s early days in North America, including his stint with the AHL’s Houston Aeros, a Wild affiliate that eventually moved to Des Moines to become the Iowa Wild. \nMinnesota, writes Koivu, is home. \n“I’ve been part of this club for 16 years, and I’ve cherished every second,” he said. “I bought my first home here, my wife and I love it here, and both our kids were born here. It’s a very special place to me.” 0 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T22:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:53:57.693+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
