He wore a suit with an overly-long red power tie and mocked Trump’s hair by wearing a stuffed animal on his head. \nStewart mocked Trump’s flurry of executive orders by reading faux proclamations from the president, including demanding China immediately send the U.S. the Great Wall in order to secure the Mexican border. \nStewart turned more serious at the end of the bit, saying the country has never faced what he called Trump’s “purposeful, vindictive chaos” before. \nStewart is an executive producer of the “Late Show.” Advertisement ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T18:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T04:17:03.821+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
