'Lion' is nominated in six categories at the Oscars including Best Supporting Actor and Best Film and is based on his book 'A Long Way Home'. Dev Patel plays the grown up Saroo while Sunny Pawar plays the younger version. The film directed by Garth Davis also stars legendary actress Nicole Kidman as his adoptive mother.\nSaroo united with his mother after 25 years of separating from his family at the age of five. He now lives in Australia with his adopted parents. The lion heart spoke exclusively to timesofindia.com about the film, his life and his reel counterparts: Dev Patel and Sunny Pawar. Excerpts from the interview:\nLife has come a full circle for you. You wrote the book ' A Long Way Home ' and now the film 'Lion' has been made on it. How has been the experience revisiting those memories?\nYes, it has come a full circle. I think if you go to watch the movie, it's painful at times but it's not painful to the point that you walk out stressed and feel deranged. My story has been known for many years. It doesn't drive you to the point that it challenges your psychology but it does make you feel emotional as emotions just sort of go wild. It just has a natural effect on people.\nLion Review\nWhat was the response of the two families when they saw your journey again, this time on-screen? Was it like seeing it with their own eyes?\nMy biological family hasn't seen the film yet but my adopted parents have watched the film a couple of times. They just get emotional so quickly watching a child that they have raised up as their own and given love, and have heard stories, which I told them about myself. But it's a visual now which they actually get to see, it's another dimension. They realized after the movie that their child has gone through that much and we hugged and cried for about 30 minutes. The movie really makes a lot of people question of who we are as a human being.\nWhat has changed in your life after you found your Indian family?\nNothing much, just that I have two mothers now. Both of them love me a lot. I keep in touch with my mother in India. I have already visited India about 15 times to meet her and will continue to do so.\nCould you see yourself in Dev Patel? He is nominated for the Oscars.\nHe is a fantastic actor. He is very serious towards his acting and puts in his best into bringing a character alive. But Sunny Pawar is just awesome. He is the hell of a kid and is just a wonderful talent.\nYou are in awe of Sunny Pawar. Did you see your childhood in the film?\nHe is a power house. He is so organic and original; he doesn't need to do much to sink into the character. He has done a wonderful job in the film. He looks so much like me when I was a kid.\nDo you miss losing your Indian childhood, identity and language?\nI was just five when I got separated from my family and then I was adopted by the family in Australia. I don't remember much of it before that and have grown up here. English is my language and my family is my identity.\nWhat's home - India or Australia?\nHome is Australia definitely. I have grown up here. It's my heritage. My family is here.\nWhat do you think about the film's chances at the Oscars?\nThe chances seem good since it has been getting a lot of appreciation. However, I really want 'Lion' to get the Oscar for the Best Adapted Screenplay.\nDev Patel nominated in Oscars! 00:21", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T13:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:56:37.192+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
