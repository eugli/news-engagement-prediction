The phone also has improved capacity to process data over a network.\nThe ZTE Gigabit phone makes it possible for the user to make a 4K video, VR video as well as 360-degree video, all on the go. The phone also has instant cloud storage capacity, which makes it a winner. Along with it, the Gigabit phone has a quick cache of music and films and an instant app which makes it unnecessary to download or install apps. At the Mobile World Congress, ZTE unveiled a 5G IT baseband unit (BBU), based on architecture by Intel. The new technology which has been developing and being tested is over the 4G LTE, and not really the 5G or fifth generation of network.
