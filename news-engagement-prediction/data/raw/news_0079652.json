A modern variant of the iconic Nokia 3310 was announced at MWC 2017 today , and should be released in select markets starting the second quarter of the year. Like the original Nokia 3310 from 17 (!) years ago, the new model (which has the exact same name) is a feature phone with an alphanumeric keypad and an \"incredibly durable\" body. Moreover, the phone packs a removable 1200 mAh battery capable of providing up to 22 hours of talk time, or up to 31 days of stand-by time. Unfortunately, it seems to us that the new 3310 doesn't quite have the charm of the original model - there's something a bit too quirky about it design. Moreover, there's hardly anything modern about the rest of the phone's features, which include a 2.4-inch QVGA (240 x 320) screen, a 2 MP rear camera with LED flash, FM radio, MP3 player, 16 MB of storage space, and MicroSD card support. Another not-so-great detail is that the new Nokia 3310 does not have Wi-Fi or 3G, being a 2G-only device (and it might not work in the US at all, seeing as its international specs page doesn't list US-compatible 2G frequencies).But enough with the criticism. The new Nokia 3310 will be sold for just $49 / â‚¬49, and that's a price that many may be willing to pay for a reliable back-up phone. But would you, our dear reader, pay $49 for this handset?
