Banned Wenger has had to watch the Watford and Chelsea losses from the stand (Photo: Reuters) \nMesut Ozil’s recent form has been a major concern, with the Germany midfielder struggling to return to his standards of earlier in the season. \nAlexis Sanchez, the Gunners' other star, was clearly frustrated after the defeat at Chelsea and the atmosphere at the training ground has been downbeat. \nMirror Sport understands even the players and coaching staff have no idea whether Wenger is going to stay on, with his £8m-a-year contract due to expire at the end of the season. \nThere is a two-year contract on the table and Wenger has confirmed he will make a decision on his future based on the mood around the club and the fans.

They hope a good run will quickly change the mood. \nBut it is clear they will have to keep an open mind on Wenger’s future if the 67-year-old Frenchman does decide to go. \nBorussia Dortmund boss Thomas Tuchel, Bayer Leverkusen’s Roger Schmidt and Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim could all be potential contenders.

But there is a growing belief at Paris Saint-Germain that they will be able to lure Sanchez to the French capital this summer. \nPSG are also interested in prolific Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero, but Sanchez is their No1 priority and they are growing in confidence because the Gunners are still a long way from agreeing terms with the Chilean forward.

Arsenal have offered another £50k on top of that, but he wants a rise to in excess of £1million per month. \nThere have been overtures from China, Italian champions Juventus and Spanish heavyweights Atletico Madrid, but PSG would appear to be in pole position. \nArsenal are sweating on whether right-back Hector Bellerin will be available to face Hull on Saturday after his concussion against Chelsea. \nMidfielder Francis Coquelin has also been nursing a hamstring problem, but Mohamed Elneny is now back from Africa Cup of Nations duty with Egypt to provide an option there. poll loading Who will advance to the Champions League quarter-finals? 1000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:07:38.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
