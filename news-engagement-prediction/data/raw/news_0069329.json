Female doctor and paramedic 'also attacked' \nPolice said Deacon also attacked a female doctor who stopped to help at the roadside and was violent towards an off-duty paramedic who tried to help. \n\"I don't need to be told by anybody that when the defendant is intoxicated he becomes extremely violent in context of the charges he's facing,\" Magistrate Thacker said. \nShe told Deacon he was too dangerous to be released on bail. \n\"There is too much evidence that you are an unacceptable risk of reoffending,\" she said. \n\"They're all very serious allegations against you. \n\"For the safety — not just of the victim but also for other road users and members of community — you've been refused bail.\" \nDeacon was remanded in custody to appear in the Brisbane Magistrates Court again on March 20. \nPolice are still trying to speak to the doctor involved and have appealed for her to contact them. \nThey also want to hear from anyone who has information about the incident last Sunday, especially if they have dash-cam footage of what took place.
