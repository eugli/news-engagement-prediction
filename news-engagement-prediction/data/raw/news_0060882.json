Fans questioned the need for the censorship, particularly as it was broadcast after the 9pm watershed, and Brits Awards host Dermot O'Leary had moments earlier introduced the performance by saying ‚Äúeveryone go bats**t crazy for Skepta.\" \nWhy is Skepta getting his audio muted when the white presenters have sworn numerous times? #BRITs2017 \n‚Äî Caino (@redcain81) February 22, 2017 When skeptas the only performance you're looking forward to and it's audio muted üòäüòäüòä\n‚Äî mez (@Mezzziee) February 22, 2017 Brits - Let's invite Skepta \nBrits - let's mute him when he swears pic.twitter.com/KX8AsdFn94 \n‚Äî Lawrence James (@DJLawrenceJames) February 22, 2017 'Audio muted' - this offends me more than the potential language. So irritating. #BRITs \n‚Äî Claire Craig (@blondeC) February 22, 2017 Our favourite lyric of Skepta's - \"Shut Down\" is \"Audio Muted\".

His performance at this year's awards featured an audio skit referring back to that night, in which a female voice complains about watching a group of black men \"all dressed in black, dancing extremely aggressively\" on \"prime-time TV\". \nITV has been approached for comment.\nWatch | Skepta wins Mercury Prize 2016 00:54 Brit Awards 2017 nominees In brief | Controversial Brits moments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:19:01.875+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
