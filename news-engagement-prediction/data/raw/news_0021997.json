A Feb. 15 speaking engagement for Shkreli is listed on a Facebook page for the club, which didn’t return messages seeking comment. In a Feb. 3 Facebook post, Shkreli said he would be “giving a discussion on investing.”\nShkreli, formerly the chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals, drew intense criticism after the company purchased the rights to a decades-old drug called Daraprim, which treats a rare parasitic infection, and raised the price from less than $17 to $750 per pill.\nGet Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news, delivered weekdays.

Shkreli has pleaded not guilty to securities fraud charges in an unrelated case.\nThe Harvard Financial Analysts Club offers students finance education and gives them a chance to help manage the club’s mutual fund. The event description posted on the club’s Facebook page said it would be open only to people with Harvard-issued identification.\n“This is not a partisan event. If you disagree with Mr. Shkreli or his policies, we celebrate your right to do so,” the event listing said. “We only ask that you express your grievances with respect for your fellow peers and through the appropriate channels,” such as the Q&A session accompanying Shkreli’s talk.\nAdvertisement\nShkreli’s appearances have caused controversy at other campuses. A joint appearance at the University of California-Davis with far-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos was canceled last month after large protests.\nThe pharmaceutical industry has sought to distance itself from Shkreli and similar drug-price controversies. President Trump is among the critics of high drug prices, saying at a recent press conference that pharma companies were “getting away with murder.”\nShkreli has fired back, compiling a list of high-priced drugs offered by major pharma companies. Among the examples is Cambridge-based Biogen Inc., whose new treatment for a rare disease costs $750,000 per patient in its first year and $375,000 per subsequent year.\nCurt Woodward can be reached at curt.woodward@globe.com .
