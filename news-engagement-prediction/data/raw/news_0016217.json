That whole thing he did with slavery? Really yuuge! What a super-classy guy (even though he’s been dead for almost 122 years). \nThen Reuters reported the federal program titled, “Countering Violent Extremism” will now be called “Countering Islamic Extremism,” and will no longer focus on non-Islamic murderous terror groups in the United States such as white supremacists who’ve killed and bombed. Black History — what? \nKellyanne Conway, that other genius, talked to MSNBC’s Chris Matthews Thursday night about a Bowling Green Massacre, which never happened but that she said was perpetrated by Iraqi refugees. Who told her this? Dead Frederick Douglass? Maybe Kellyanne Conway heard about the fictitious \"Bowling Green Massacre\" from dead Frederick Douglass. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images) \n“Most people don’t know (about it) because it didn’t get covered,” she said. \nThe press hid a giant terrorist attack? Damn main stream media! \nThe only massacre that ever occurred at Bowling Green, N.Y., was of a statue — in 1776. William Martin, mega best-selling author of “The Lincoln Letter” and “City of Dreams,” told me, “When New Yorkers tore down the statue of King George, they told the world that Americans would never accept the rule of a king, a dictator, or any other kind of despot, benevolent or otherwise.” \nNation taunts Kellyanne Conway for 'Bowling Green' blunder \nDid anyone tell Trump about those restrictions before he took office? \nThen there’s the incredibly dangerously dumb leanings of Betsy DeVos, who will soon be confirmed as secretary of education — despite never having attended a public school, nor having had a child who attended one. Hell, she even lied to the Senate about her involvement in her family’s foundation, which gave millions of dollars to a group that advocates gay conversion therapy. \nDeVos is also the backer of the Neurocore centers, which promise the desperate “mind makeovers” to supposedly help autism, ADHD, depression, anxiety, Alzheimer’s and dementia by hooking them up to electrodes and making them watch movies. The New York Times reported that clients watch movies like “Frozen.” When a client’s mind drifts, the video appropriately freezes. \nDid they invent this therapy while being forced to watch “A Clockwork Orange” with their eyes pinned open? \nNew Yorkers hold vigil at Bowling Green for 'massacre' victims \nYet horrifyingly this woman will almost surely be put in charge of our American children’s education. Zaaaap. I mean, this brilliant mind will be helping our children turn not-gay, and ADHD and autism-free. Zaaaap. Betsy Devos backs the Neurocore centers, which promise “mind makeovers” to supposedly help autism, ADHD, depression, anxiety, Alzheimer’s and dementia by hooking people up to electrodes and making them watch movies. (Bros/Hawk Films/REX/Shutterstock) \nTopping off a week that you thought couldn’t get more dumb and dangerous, the GOPs in the House voted to overturn a rule that helps keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill. \nHell, why shouldn’t violent spree-killing nutjobs have the same gun rights as the nutjobs in the House? \nFinally, the U.S. military posted a video to prove that the massively failed raid in Yemen that killed one American, wounded three, and left a $75 million aircraft destroyed was actually a success. Too bad that video was 10 years old and has been online for years. \nWe’ve gone from alternative facts to alternative reality. A draft of an executive order on religious freedom would have encouraged discrimination based on faith. (Aude Guerrucci / POOL/EPA) REALLY OUT OF ‘ORDER’ \nLast week, a daft draft of a religious freedom executive order was leaked to the media. \nThis latest bit of Trump democrazy would not have just allowed but encouraged discrimination based on religion. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner reportedly talked Trump out of signing it. \nThat it was even considered is horrifyingly backward. It would have given exemptions to federal laws, inviting total chaos and informed bigotry. \nReject Betsy DeVos: Trump's unqualified education pick \nIt stated, “Americans and their religious organizations will not be coerced by the Federal Government into participating in activities that violate their conscience.” \nCivil rights attorney Norman Siegel notes that the courts have already determined that you cannot discriminate against someone based on race, religion or sexual orientation. Period. \nSo far, Trump’s reams of executive orders, which he erroneously believes are enforceable law in a democracy, are being halted just as quickly. \nOn Friday another federal judge issued another restraining order, this one of the nationwide travel ban. It was done by a judge appointed by President George W. Bush. \nEven the right is saying Trump’s wrong. EXPRESS LINES \nProof of the adage that when things aren’t adding up, you should start subtracting: The economy added 227,000 jobs in January, which caused unemployment to rise from 4.7 to 4.8%. What? \n... A man in Mississippi was told he was just fat when, in fact, he had a 130-pound tumor which had been caused by, yes, an ingrown hair. He didn’t need a doctor, he needed Nair. \n... The revolution will be televised — and played on the radio. Big Sean rapped about murdering the President on Hot 97 and his new song “No Favors” features Eminem rapping that “Trump’s a bitch.” Not exactly in the vein of protest music like the gentle “Blowin’ in the Wind,” it’s more like violently blowing someone away. Rao's co-owner Frank Pellegrino was a dear pal. (Ethan Miller) A FRIEND LIKE ‘NO’ OTHER \nYou’ll hear many stories about my dear pal, Frankie Pellegrino, the genius behind Rao’s who passed away last week. \nYou’ll hear that he was nicknamed “Frankie No” by “French Connection” cop Sonny Grosso because Frankie’s answer to all reservation requests at his 10-table East Harlem joint was just “no,” always “no,” no matter what. \nYou’ll hear about how stars and Presidents (if they could get a table) hobnobbed there with Louie Lump Lump, Johnny Roast Beef and Joey Cupcake. You’ll hear that at charity auctions people bid $50G for a one-night Rao’s reservation — not including the food. \nBut you’ll never hear the one about how “Frankie No” couldn’t get a table himself. A couple of years ago, Frankie, his wonderful wife Josephine, my husband and I went to a movie on New Year's Eve in Rockville Centre, L.I. We figured we’d ring in midnight at a local pub. Too bad we were turned away at every one. They told us and Frankie: “No.” They were full. So, we went to a diner. \nThing is, “Frankie No” never said no to me. I had my first book party at Rao’s and the last chapter of my next novel, “Book Of Judas” ends with Frankie “No” singing “My Girl.” \nFrankie was like a gorgeous woman who doesn’t use her beauty as power. He said “no” to everyone, but it wasn’t about power, it was about loyalty. You had a table, you had a table, “no” matter who you are. \nIf you were his friend, he had your back. (But it didn’t mean you had a table!) R.I.P., my dear and loyal pal. The city is so much dimmer without your light. Chelsea Clinton walked into a fight with Kellyanne Conway. (Stephanie Keith/Getty Images) CHELSEA PICKS WRONG OPPONENT FOR A TWITTER FIGHT \nChelsea Clinton, apparently trying to prove she might actually one day hold down a job (the White House) that her parents didn’t get her, started tweeting mediocre thoughts about politics and immediately got into a blood brawl with Kellyanne Conway. \nChelsea obviously didn’t learn by her mother’s example that you don’t walk into a room with a loaf of white bread when your enemy’s holding the bread knife.
