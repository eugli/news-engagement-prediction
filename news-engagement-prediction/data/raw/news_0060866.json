Mr Netanyahu thanked Australia for defending his nation against UN resolutions.\nThe tone struck by Mr Rudd in his Facebook post was a marked contrast.\nMr Rudd said he was a life-long supporter of Israel and had publicly campaigned against anti-Semitism. But he added that \"to support the state of Israel does not mandate automatic support for each and every policy of Mr Netanyahu\".\n\"The boundaries, internal security, external security, public finance and governance of a Palestinian state have been elaborated in detail in multiple negotiations with the US under the Clinton, Bush and Obama Administrations, most recently in the Kerry Plan,\" Mr Rudd wrote.\n\"Mr Netanyahu knows these formulations like the back of his hand. Mr Netanyahu also knows he has torpedoed each of them, often at five minutes to midnight, often by changing the goalposts, to the enduring frustration of both Republican and Democrat Administrations.\"\nThe former prime minister also referred to a diplomatic incident in 2010 where four forged Australian passports were used in the murder of a Hamas operative in Dubai.\nMr Rudd's government expelled an Israeli diplomat over the affair. \"No apology has ever been received for that action,\" he said.\nA rally protesting against the Mr Netanyahu's visit is expected to be held in Sydney on Thursday night.", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-39047638", "https://www.facebook.com/MrKRudd/", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10145459", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/488A/production/_94807581_gettyimages-643588808.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-23T10:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T10:18:21.191+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
