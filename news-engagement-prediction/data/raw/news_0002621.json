I rushed out and saw my mother sprawled on the grass...with blood coming out from her ears,\" she said when met at her house here. \nMaisuri said several villagers told her that they saw the flying tyre hit her mother before crashing into a motorcycle and wrecking a sundry shop located 50 metres away. \n\"The tyre was so big. It needs more than six men to move it onto a police lorry,\" she said. \nMaisuri said she and her husband returned to her parents house yesterday to join the family's convoy to send off her newly-wed sister, Mazni, 27, to her groom's house tomorrow. \"It seems that my mom's wish to join the convoy to the groom's house will forever remain as a dream. We are deeply saddened but we have to accept the tragedy as fate,\" she said. - Bernama ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T18:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T13:04:27.354+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
