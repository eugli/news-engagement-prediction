In his executive order, Mr. Trump threatened to withhold discretionary federal funds from cities that do not comply. Mr. Gimenez has disavowed the sanctuary city label, an amorphous, highly politicized term.

Credit Joe Raedle/Getty Images “We never consented to be a sanctuary city,” Mr. Gimenez said. “I think people are overreacting; this takes Miami Dade County back to the same spot it was in in December 2013.” As for the federal dollars, “It’s quite a bit of money,” he said, adding, that the sum is worth protecting. Miami-Dade County is not alone in wrestling with the policy. In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott has taken a page from Mr. Trump’s playbook and has denied the Travis County sheriff, Sally Hernandez, $1.5 million in funds for declining to comply with federal immigration detainer requests, a position he called “reckless” and “dangerous.” Sheriff Hernandez, a Democrat elected in November, said last week that she would not honor the requests unless the person was arrested on a serious felony, like capital murder, or human smuggling. In St. Paul, the county sheriff faces pressure from Republicans to abide by the detention request. And two Republican members of Congress from Pennsylvania have introduced bills to carry out Mr. Trump’s order by withholding community development grants from sanctuary cities. Many other sanctuary cities and counties with large numbers of immigrants, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and Boston, have chosen not to cooperate with the presidential dictate. In choosing to honor the detainer requests, Mr. Gimenez now faces a possible county commission vote on the issue next week and could be courting a flurry of expensive lawsuits, legal experts said. Several courts around the country have found the detention policy unconstitutional because people can only be detained for extended periods with permission from the courts. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “Multiple court decisions found that holding anyone for any amount of time longer than normal did not meet constitutional standards,” said Lena Graber, special projects attorney for the Immigrant Legal Resource Center in San Francisco. “The Miami-Dade mayor’s decision is on really thin constitutional ground.” Photo Bilal Karakira prayed during the protest on Tuesday. Credit Scott McIntyre for The New York Times Complicating matters is that not everyone who is flagged for detention are necessarily illegal immigrants; some are naturalized citizens, Ms. Graber said. Many in Miami worry that Mr. Trump’s order could lead to increased collaboration between the local police and immigration officials, something that immigration activists say could discourage immigrants from reporting crimes or sharing information. The order revives a program to deputize local law enforcement to act as immigration officers on the street, a role that Miami-Dade rejects. In 2009, dozens of police and sheriff departments around the country took part in the program, which ran into legal trouble in some places, most notably in Phoenix , when officers began conducting traffic patrols to try to nab illegal immigrants. Typically, most law enforcement officers, including in Miami-Dade, do not meddle in immigration matters or ask a person’s immigration status either on the streets or in jails.
