Like Adele, maybe?\" \nWe did some research, and it does appear there is a secret committee, but from what we can gather, the committee is designed to knock out embarrassing nominations -- like, say, Milli Vanilli. However, once the nominations are locked, the voters have the final say ... at least that's what we've found. \nWe reached out to The Recording Academy for comment ... so far no word back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T06:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:29:39.832+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
