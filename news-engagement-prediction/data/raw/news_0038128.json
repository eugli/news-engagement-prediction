(Source: Kehke Pehno/Twitter) \nTiger Shroff is back in news after the first look of his next film Munna Michael was released recently. Shroff, known for his impeccable dance moves, is reportedly paying a tribute to Michael Jackson through the film. But that’s not the only reason that the film’s first look is being talked about so much. The young actor seen in mid-air, seemingly in the middle of a dance move wearing a red check shirt, jeans and bandana, has caught the attention of Twitter users, who did not spare any time to start captioning the photo. \nFrom calling him the 105th missile that India is sending to space, to calling him ‘Ninja Chacha’ — Twitterati has left no stone unturned to crack people up with their captions. Others have called him Bidu Beta Launch Vehicle or BBLV ( a take on PSLV). Yes, the captions are nothing less than a laugh riot.
