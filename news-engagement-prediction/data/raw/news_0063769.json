In many parts of the world, glaciers have been in retreat, creating dangerously large lakes that can cause devastating flooding when the banks break. Climate change can also increase rainfall in some areas, while bringing drought to others.\nHira Ali \n5/11 Smoke – filled with the carbon that is driving climate change – drifts across a field in Colombia.\nSandra Rondon\n6/11 A river once flowed along the depression in the dry earth of this part of Bangladesh, but it has disappeared amid rising temperatures. \nAbrar Hossain\n7/11 Sindh province in Pakistan has experienced a grim mix of two consequences of climate change.\r “Because of climate change either we have floods or not enough water to irrigate our crop and feed our animals,” says the photographer. “Picture clearly indicates that the extreme drought makes wide cracks in clay. Crops are very difficult to grow.”\nRizwan Dharejo \n8/11 A shepherd moves his herd as he looks for green pasture near the village of Sirohi in Rajasthan, northern India.\r The region has been badly affected by heatwaves and drought, making local people nervous about further predicted increases in temperature.\nRiddhima Singh Bhati \n9/11 A factory in China is shrouded by a haze of air pollution.
