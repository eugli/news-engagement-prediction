(Photo: Sean Rayford, Getty Images) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWASHINGTON — Corporations with big interests in federal policy contributed millions to help underwrite President Trump’s recent inauguration, federal records show. \nPfizer, Dow Chemical and Bank of America gave $1 million apiece to the inaugural committee, which raised private funds for the balls, receptions, parade and other events celebrating Trump’s Jan. 20 swearing-in. More than a dozen companies have reported giving a little more than $7 million total through Dec. 31, a USA TODAY tally of recently filed lobbying reports show. \nInaugural organizers have said they collected about $100 million for last month’s event — a record sum that’s nearly double the $53 million in private money President Obama took in for his first inauguration. Obama did not accept corporate donations for the 2009 event but did take corporate funds for his second inauguration in 2013. \nA full accounting of Trump’s inaugural fundraising and spending isn’t due until April, but recent filings with Congress from lobbyists and the companies that employ them offer a snapshot of the efforts by corporate America to support Trump once he captured the White House. \nPfizer, which spent nearly $9.8 million on federal lobbying last year, made its $1 million inaugural donation on Dec. 21, records show. \nCompany spokeswoman Sharon Castillo said Pfizer has contributed to inaugural committees “on both sides of the aisle” in the past and “decided to make a financial contribution to the presidential inaugural committee this time around.” \nPfizer did not donate to Obama’s 2013 inauguration, according to public records, and Castillo declined to discuss why the company did not provide financial support then. \nIndustries are bracing for big change under the Trump administration — from moves to roll back so-called Dodd-Frank regulations on the financial sector to efforts to drive down drug prices. Shortly before he took office, Trump said pharmaceutical companies were “getting away with murder” and pledged that he would allow Medicare, the federal insurance system for the disabled and elderly, to negotiate prices with drug makers. \nIn a Jan. 31 meeting with pharmaceutical executives at the White House, Trump was less critical and said he would cut taxes and streamline regulations as a way to drive down prices, a move applauded by the drug makers. \nBank of America, which donated $300,000 to Obama’s 2013 inauguration, gave $1 million on Dec. 19 for Trump’s festivities, records show. \n“We consider it part of our civic responsibility to pitch in,” Lawrence Di Rita, a Bank of America spokesman, said in an email about the donation. “We supported prior inaugurals at meaningful levels, just as we did this year.” \nRecords show other Trump inaugural donors include ExxonMobil, Amgen, Florida Crystals Corp., tobacco giant Altria and Microsoft, each of which donated $500,000. Half of Microsoft’s donation took the form of in-kind products and services. \nOther companies previously have announced contributions to the inaugural committee. Boeing, which faced a Twitter attack from Trump in December over the cost of the company’s work on the next generation of the Air Force One fleet, donated $1 million to the Trump inaugural festivities , matching the amount it gave to the Obama events in 2013. \nTrump has since met several times with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg and on Friday, traveled to South Carolina to celebrate the launch of Boeing’s newest aircraft, the Dreamliner 787-10, and tout his message of preserving American jobs. \nRead more: Pro-Trump lobbyist lands big clients for new D.C. office \nThose who gave $1 million to Trump’s inauguration received an array of special perks, including tickets to a black-tie candlelight dinner at Washington’s Union Station attended by Trump and his family, admission to the Inaugural Balls and VIP seating along the Inaugural Parade route. \nTrump and his allies also raised private funds to help pay staff and other costs associated with his presidential transition. \nThose donations are capped at $5,000 per donor. The lobbying reports analyzed by USA TODAY show about two dozen lobbyists, their employers and political action committees reported contributing to the transition effort through Dec. 31. Their spending totaled nearly $100,000. Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
