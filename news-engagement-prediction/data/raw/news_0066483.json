The White House was said to have invited press organisations to the event. \nREAD MORE: * Bannon declares all-out war on 'corporatist' media \nThe three major broadcast networks – CBS, ABC, and NBC – were invited to the briefing, as were several news outlets that play to a conservative readership, such as Breitbart, The Washington Times and One America News Network. \nThe manoeuvre threatens to cut off some of the nation's most prominent and esteemed news organisations from a daily event that has for years been seen as ingrained in the White House press beat. \nIt also puts a metaphorical barrier between a \"gaggle\" that allows for the dissemination of information by the President of the United States to the world and the public that elected him to the office. \nCNN's Sara Murray described the incident on air: \"We lined up. We were told there was a list ahead of time, which is sort of abnormal, but we put our name on a list. And then when we went to enter, I was blocked by a White House staffer, who said we were not on the list for this gaggle today. \n\"Now, normally, if you were going to do something like this – an extended gaggle, off camera – you would have one person from each news outlet. As you know, we have multiple people from CNN here every day. So, if you're going to do something beyond a pool, which is sort of the smallest group of reporters that then disseminates the information, you would have one person from every news outlet. Ad Feedback \n\"That is not what the White House was doing today. \n\"What the White House was doing was handpicking the outlets they wanted in for this briefing. So Breitbart, the Washington Times , the One America News Network – news outlets that maybe the White House feels are more favourable were all allowed in, whereas I was blocked from entering, Politico was blocked from entering, the New York Times , the LA Times . \n\"All of these news outlets were blocked from going to a gaggle.\" - AAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T04:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:18:31.569+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
