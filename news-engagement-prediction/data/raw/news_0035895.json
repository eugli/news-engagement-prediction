The production version -- Baleno RS will be launched on March 3.(AP file photo) \nMaruti Suzuki is all set to launch Baleno RS, the sporty version of the premium hatchback, on March 3. The car will feature a one-litre Boosterjet engine which the company claims would “punch far above its weight to deliver amazing power and road speed”. \nHere are five things to know about the upcoming new car: \n1) Maruti Suzuki first launched Baleno in October 2015, and continues to sell an average 8,600 units from the Nexa showrooms every month, the best seller among the automaker’s premium models. \nThe Baleno RS Concept was first showcased at the Delhi Auto Expo in February 2016. The concept was an upgrade of the production model, with a large chrome honeycomb grille, Bi-Xenon LED headlamps and beefed-up bumpers. While the Baleno RS would remain as long (3995mm) and wide (1745mm) as the Baleno, it will be 10mm taller at 1510mm. \n2) The USP of the Baleno RS would be its powerhouse – a 1.0 Boosterjet engine, a newly developed direct-injection turbo petrol engine by Suzuki Motor Corp in Japan for international markets. \nThe 998-cc, three cylinder engine will be mated to a 5-speed manual gearbox, though there’s no word on the automatic variant yet.

The present Baleno borrows the two variants of its engines from the Swift: \n1.2 litre K-Series petrol | 85PS power @ 6000 rpm | 115Nm of torque @ 4000 rpm \n1.3-litre DDiS diesel | 75PS power @ 4000rpm | 190 Nm of torque @ 2000 rpm \nThat makes the Boosterjet engine significance: 200cc smaller, but pumps out 27PS more. \n4) The Baleno will take on the Volkswagen Polo GT and the Fiat Abarth Punto. While 1.2-litre TSI petrol Polo GT starts at Rs 9.13 lakh, the 1.4-litre T-Jet petrol Abarth Punto comes Rs 9.98 lakh onwards. \n5) Maruti Suzuki has been on top of its game with aggressive pricing, be it the Vitara Brezza or the Ignis. \nSince the Baleno RS may be available only in the top trim, Alpha, expect this hot hatch to come at around Rs 8.5 lakh.
