Some people took to Twitter to protest the immigration theme of the 60-second \"Born the Hard Way\" spot, starting a boycott campaign on Twitter. Matthew Hurst / Wikimedia Commons \"Get ready to #boycottbudweiser for playing politics with their pro immigration super bowl ad,\" one tweet said. Others responded to the boycott campaign in support of the ad's message. \"Boycott Budweiser for recognizing the truth? Nope. Drink up,\" another tweet said. The Budweiser ad was still one of the most watched ads ahead of the game, according to the Associated Press, which named the spot as one of the advertising winners of this year's Super Bowl. The Budweiser ad likely cost $2 million to $3 million to produce, according to Adweek, which cited people familiar with campaigns of this size. Super Bowl network Fox charged $5 million-plus, a record, for a 30-second spot, so the brand might invest as much as $15 million in the minute-long ad. Angela Mueller covers health care.
