By Karan Shah | Published: February 2, 2017 8:45 pm Salman Khan, Aamir Khan, Jacqueline Fernandez, Saif Ali Khan: Celebs spotted at airport \nWe told you earlier how the makers of Judwaa 2 are planning to recreate two iconic songs – Oonchi Hai Building and Chalti Hai Kya Nau Se Barah from the original movie. Yes, we will see Varun Dhawan , Jacqueline Fernandez and Taapsee Pannu groove to these numbers in the sequel. However after a few recreated songs like Humma Humma ( OK Jaanu ) and Teri Fariyaad (Tum Bin 2 ) failing to live up to the expectations, everyone have now become against this trend. So Varun, Jackie and Taapsee will have to recreate the right moves and the makers will have to hit the right notes to make these two iconic songs successful. \nIf recreating two iconic hits from the 90s was not challenging enough, Varun and team Judwaa 2 have to fill the shoes of Salman Khan , Karisma Kapoor and Rambha. All the three actors had put up really energetic and tremendous performances in Judwaa , so it will be difficult for Varun, Jackie and Taapsee to match them. However, it isn’t impossible! Here are a few things we want them to get right in Judwaa 2 : \n# Energy \nIf you see Oonchi Hai Building and Chalti Hai Kya Nau Se Barah , you will realise that Salman, Karisma and Rambha dance with a lot of energy. Varun, Jackie and Taapsee will have to match up to that level of energy to keep up with the fast beats. Difficult but not impossible. \n# Expressions \nSalman showcases a range of expressions and emotions in both the songs. Mind you, Salman had to play two contrasting characters and behave accordingly too. While Varun has a lot of talent, he will have a hard time recreating those complex set of expressions.

This caught the audience’s attention and made the dance numbers big hits. Varun, Jacqueline and Taapsee will have to come up with some new and unique moves too. ALSO READ – Not Just Salman Khan, Karishma Kapoor will also have a cameo in Varun Dhawan-Jacqueline Fernandez’s Judwaa 2 \nJudwaa 2 goes on floor tomorrow and they will shoot for Chalti Hai Kya Nau Se Barah first. Well, we can’t wait to see the trio recreate the two iconic hits.
