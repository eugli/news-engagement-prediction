A loveable pocket saucepot, she lit up lightweight television comedies such as Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps and Gavin and Stacey.\nHaving got her break, though, she proved capable of far more – slaying the critics, first, with a brilliant combination of singing and dancing in the musical stage version of Legally Blonde, and then with a heart-breaking performance as Doris in Terence Rattigan’s wartime tragedy Flare Path. The moment she blew her brains out as Hedda Gabler at the Old Vic in 2012, the comparisons to Barbara Windsor died a death, too.\nThe nation hasn’t taken its eyes off her since. ITV cast her in star vehicles about Charmaine Biggs, the train robber’s wife, and Cilla Black. In the BBC’s adaptation of Lisa Lynch’s bestselling memoir The C Word, she shaved her head and channelled every woman’s fear of breast cancer. She was nominated for a Bafta for that performance (to go alongside the Bafta she won for Mrs Biggs and her two Olivier awards).\nSheridan Smith: life and career in pictures B ut cancer has also cast a shadow over Smith’s life. Last year, she was forced to pull out of her critically acclaimed run in Funny Girl in London after appearing to slur her words on stage. It was later revealed that she was suffering from stress and exhaustion after learning that her father had terminal cancer.\nBut it is Smith’s honesty and sensitivity that makes her such an exceptional performer, and those qualities led to another scorching performance tonight in the opening episode of The Moorside (BBC One).\nChronicling the notorious kidnapping of nine-year-old Shannon Matthews , who disappeared from the Moorside estate in Dewsbury in 2008, the two-part drama, written by Neil McKay, shone a torch into a dark story from a sideways angle: the can-do crusade of neighbour Julie Bushby (Smith) to mobilise the community and demonstrate its moral worth to the police and the media. “Love,” Julie insisted, “is what makes the world go round.”\nSiân Brooke, Sheridan Smith and Gemma Whelan in 'The Moorside' T he facts of the case will be familiar to many – how it eventually emerged that Shannon’s mother, Karen, had conspired with an accomplice to hide her daughter and share a £50,000 reward for finding her. Both culprits were imprisoned. But the first episode warned that some poetic licence had been taken.\nThis showed in the odd editorial signpost, while Julie’s set-tos with her gobby son felt a little too entertaining. Director Paul Whittington’s stylistic flourishes sparkled among the grimness: a line of high-vis coppers appearing over a hill; pastel-hued balloons taking flight.\nBut The Moorside derived its stark power from stripped-back performances anchoring the story in reality. Wearing not an ounce of make-up on blanched, puffy cheeks, Smith exuded fiery faith in working-class bonds of loyalty in the face of society’s censure. Her searing intensity, a charismatic ability to pull focus, is what makes her a compelling presence in musical theatre: she seems to walk in her own spotlight.\nA nd, in The Moorside, it was as if her Julie, an attention-seeking, rabble-rousing loudmouth working for a higher cause, was forever attempting to hit the back wall.\n“We know we’re as good as anyone!” she cried like a Shakespearean tribune of the people. “We stand shoulder to shoulder with one another!” And yet there were other moments where Smith allowed the camera to find the still detail, never more than in the final scene when the scales fell from her eyes and her entire belief system threatened to crumple on impact with tawdry truth.\nT he Moorside isn’t all about Smith. Siobhan Finneran shone as the firm but fair family liaison officer DC Christine Freeman, and Siân Brooke (recently dazzling as Sherlock’s sister) stood out again as the gimlet-eyed neighbour who smelled a rat. As feeble-minded Karen Matthews, Gemma Whelan was given licence to bounce off the walls.\nBut what ensured that The Moorside was no exercise in finger-wagging voyeurism was Smith’s pugnacious integrity.\n“All I’m saying is I wouldn’t go raising people’s hopes,” said Finneran’s detective.\n“And all I’m saying is f--- off. No offence.”\nSmith’s performance said far more than that.\nSheridan Smith profile", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:23:37.472+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
