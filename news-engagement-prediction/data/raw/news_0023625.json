And it will soon be made available for other users as well, the company said. \nThe live stream feature, which can be accessed through the company's mobile application, will have the same features as the existing YouTube videos. \n\"Mobile live streaming has been built directly into the YouTube mobile app. All you have to do to start streaming is open YouTube, hit the capture button, and you?re live! Streamed videos will have all the same features as regular YouTube videos,\" the company said. \nCreators from more than 20 countries including India can also earn money from their live streaming videos using a new monetisation tool named 'Super Chat'. \nFor the viewers, the tool would be useful in \"standing out \" from the crowd and get a creator's attention by purchasing chat messages that are highlighted in bright colors'. \nThe chat message will then stay pinned to the top for up to five hours, it said. \nThe monetisation tool will be available to viewers from more than 40 countries to purchase chat privileges.
