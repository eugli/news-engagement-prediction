He did not feel as if he was \"back\" until last week against the Hawks and his mentor, Dwight Howard. Capela had 22 points in 31 minutes that night, scoring on drives, jump hooks and lobs. But more than scoring, he said he was running as he had before the injury forced him to miss 15 games. \n\"Conditioning-wise, I feel good now,\" Capela said. \"Against the Hawks I felt so. I was back to running. I felt really good. I sprinted the court. My legs felt good. I was trying to get offensive rebounds. I was able to get back (defensively) and talk. I was feeling really good about that. The legs feel good, too.\" \nIn last week's back-to-back against the Hawks and Bulls, and full-sized centers Howard and Robin Lopez, Capela averaged 18 points on 16-of-19 shooting. His 63.7 percent shooting this season is fourth in the NBA. He has had at least nine rebounds in his past three games after getting nine rebounds just once in his first eight games after returning from his injury. \nThe Rockets expect to be at full strength as center with Nene cleared to practice on Monday after sitting out Friday's game with a sore groin. Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said the lighter schedule will allow him to determine his rotation without factoring in rest for Nene, but will generally try to get Capela, Nene and Montrezl Harrell into games. \n\"That will mean someone won't get to play as much,\" D'Antoni said. \"A lot of times that falls on Montrezl. He probably doesn't like it. We're going to try our best to play all three. All three have been good. We need different things from all three of them. We'll have to kind of hit and miss. That's when you try to talk to the guys and say, 'This is the way it is. It's not the best in the world.' But they understand.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:33:12.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
