The constitution doesn’t (apply to) 97 or 98 percent of people, and the other two percent can be discriminated against.” \nHe noted that Sally Yates, who until late Monday served as acting U.S. attorney general under Trump before she was fired, refused to defend the order because she believed it was without legal merit. \nWashington state’s attorney general became the first this week to declare plans to file a lawsuit against Trump. San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court Tuesday challenging Trump’s executive order that directs the federal government to withhold grants and other funding from jurisdictions considered sanctuaries for undocumented immigrants that limit cooperation with immigration authorities. \nWithout providing specifics, Becerra said he was willing to wage the war with unconventional tactics. \n“There are no rules with Donald Trump. Even if there were, he’d sucker punch you below the belt, so if you’re going to play by the rules, you’re already behind the game in the way this administration plays,” Becerra said. “I’m not interested in the president of the United States sucker punching the people of California. That’s how I feel, so that’s how I’ll act. We have an understanding that we’re dealing with someone who doesn’t play by the rules.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:27:48.698+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
