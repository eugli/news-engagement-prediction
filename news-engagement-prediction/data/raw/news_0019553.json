Successive defeats to Watford and Chelsea have left Arsenal 12 points off the pace and facing a perennial scramble to remain in the top four. \nThe 24-year-old will return to London Colney for assessment tomorrow to determine whether he is ready to return to the starting line-up against Hull on Saturday. Central midfield reinforcements are badly needed. Neville has 'overstepped mark' with attack on fans, say Arsenal Fan TV \nAlex Oxlade-Chamberlain produced a few bright moments at Stamford Bridge but it was not a convincing audition for an extended run in the middle of the pitch, as he craves. \nHull do not possess Chelsea’s power, but the sight of Oxlade-Chamberlain and Francis Coquelin being overwhelmed at times by Antonio Conte’s side will surely force Wenger to look elsewhere, especially with next Wednesday’s Champions League last-16, first-leg clash at Bayern Munich in mind.

Statistics show Arsenal have been outrun in their last nine League matches, averaging nearly three miles fewer than their opponents. \nArsenal tend to dominate possession, so those figures have a notable caveat, but there is a need to inject some fresh dynamism. \nElneny is understood to have suffered no ill effects from a quick return to action in Sunday’s final against Cameroon following a calf injury sustained earlier in the competition. Mentally, he might need a little longer to move on. He scored the opening goal but saw Egypt concede an 88th-minute winner. Premier League standings after 24 matches \nThe biggest problem created by Santi Cazorla’s ongoing absence is a lack of quick forward distribution from midfield and the more pedestrian the pace in Arsenal’s passing, the less effective Mesut Ozil, Alexis Sanchez and Theo Walcott become. \nElneny has not been an unqualified success since his £7million move from Basel just over a year ago, but with Aaron Ramsey sidelined with a calf problem, Cazorla several weeks away from returning, Jack Wilshere away on loan and Granit Xhaka serving the last game of a four-match ban, his return is a welcome sight. \nElneny gave an interview during his time away in which he claimed he wants to become an Arsenal “legend”. Now would be a perfect time to start building that legacy.
