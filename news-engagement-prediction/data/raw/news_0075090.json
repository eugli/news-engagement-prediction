Jurgen Klopp sends warning to his Liverpool flops after Leicester loss \nIt paid off, with Fabregas – making his 300th Premier League appearance – scoring one and setting up another in a 3-1 with for the Blues. \nConte explained afterwards that, aware that Swansea play a compact game, Fabregas’ superior passing ability was the reason for the change. \n‘Swansea play very, very compact,’ Conte told Chelsea’s official website. Cesc Fabregas celebrates after opening the scoring (Getty) \n‘Probably in this game it was difficult to find the space to play between the lines. I’m very happy, for Cesc, but also Nemanja. \n‘When I called him to play off the bench, he played really well. N’Golo is playing fantastic. This is why we are top of the league – all my players are playing very, very well.’ A post shared by Cesc Fàbregas (@cescf4bregas) on Feb 25, 2017 at 10:39am PST \nThe lack of starts for Fabregas this season has led to speculation that the former Arsenal player will look to move on. The game against Swansea was just the sixth time this season the 29-year-old had been named in the starting line-up. But despite concerns of upsetting his players, Conte has hinted he will continue to rotate his players. \n‘For me, it’s always difficult to make these decisions. But I have to do this. Sometimes I make a mistake, but I try to do the best for the team because I want to win. \n‘Against Swansea I decided to start with Cesc, but don’t forget Matic is playing a fantastic championship, Kante the same. \n‘We must continue in this way. Our target is more important than a single player.’ To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Chelsea fixtures \nWest Ham (A) – Mon 6 Mar Manchester Utd – FA Cup (H) – Mon 13 Mar Stoke (A) – Sat 18 Mar Crystal Palace (H) – Sat 1 Apr Manchester City (H) – Wed 5 Apr Bournemouth (A) – Sat 8 Apr Manchester United (A) – Sat 15 Apr ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T16:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:53:41.170+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
