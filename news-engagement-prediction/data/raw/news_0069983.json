Small The city of Atlanta's new transportation plan will focus on reducing people's reliance on cars for their main form of transportation, the city planning commissioner said. Speaking at a public meeting on the transportation plan Tuesday (Feb. 21) in Buckhead, Planning Commissioner Tim Keane said the Atlanta area is expected to grow by 2.5 million over 25 years. “We think that the city’s growth over the next 25 years will be much more substantial than it has been the last 25 or 50 years,” said Keane i n a Reporter Newspapers story . The city of Atlanta is updating its transportation plan with a focus on reducing reliance… more Byron E. Small “The reality is that it is very important that many, most or maybe all of those 2.5 million people drive a lot less than we do or the congestion will be unbearable,” Keane said. “We will not grow and the city will not thrive if we don’t ensure a lot of the people coming here do not drive.” Residents at the public meeting on “Atlanta’s Transportation Plan” voiced a mix of skepticism and hope for more details and action. About 30 people who went to the meeting at the Atlanta International School. The series of public meetings are an effort to update to the Connect Atlanta Plan adopted in 2008. The city’s needs have changed greatly since then, Keane said. The economy is far different today, population has increased and development permits are being issued more often. Consultant Paul Moore , who is working with the city, presented the plan’s basic concepts. Project proposals will come later. One of the plan's main focuses is reducing the reliance on cars as people’s main form of transportation. Cars are a much less efficient use of space on roads than public transportation or biking, so Moore said a priority would be making buses and MARTA more convenient and improving bike paths. Adding sidewalks in needed areas is planned to encourage walking. The plan will also adapt to and anticipate new technology including self-driving cars and ride-sharing services, Moore said. Among the interactive exhibits at the meeting was a list headlined, “Which of the following would discourage you from driving?” Some of the choices included increased gas prices, decreased parking, traffic calming and reduced speeds and increased parking rates.
