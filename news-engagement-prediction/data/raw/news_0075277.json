Dr. Edward Diethrich , the founder of the Arizona Heart Hospital & Foundation, lost his battle with brain cancer on Feb. 23 at the age of 81. The cardiovascular surgeon was a pioneer and innovator in heart treatment, inventing a tool years ago that continues to be used in open heart surgery today worldwide. Enlarge Dr. Edward Diethrich, founder of the Arizona Heart Institute & Foundation. When he finished his book last January — \"The Serendipitous Life of Edward Diethrich \" — his cancer was in remission. But the disease came back, putting him in hospice care most recently. Julie Frisoni , a former producer for KPNX-TV Channel 12 who now owns her own public relations firm, has been working with Diethrich on his book over the past two years, most recently recording and publicizing it. \"It has been one of the greatest honors of my career to work with him over these last two years,\" Frisoni said. \"He was the most brilliant person. People know Dr. Diethrich in Arizona for the amazing work he did with the Arizona Heart Hospital and the Arizona Heart Foundation and the Arizona Heart Institute, which are legacies that will live on long, long after today.\" But his work is international, she said. \"The people he's touched and the innovations he has created will live on long past today and help millions more people,\" she said. Diethrich was a perfectionist, she said. \"He wanted and expected excellence and greatness from people who worked for him because he expected it of himself,\" Frisoni said. \"That's who he was. He was an amazing person and I'm greatly honored that he chose me to work with him these last two years.\" While he sold the Arizona Heart Institute in 2010, he continued to serve as its medical director for a few years until he left it in 2013 , but continued to run his foundation. The Arizona Heart Institute and the Arizona Heart Hospital are operated by Abrazo Community Health Network, which is owned by Tenet Healthcare Corp. (NYSE: THC). Frank Molinaro, market CEO for Abrazo, said Diethrich's passing is a significant loss for the Valley, the nation and the international cardiovascular community. \"Dr. Diethrich was a pioneer whose knowledge and considerable talents advanced cardiovascular care in unimaginable ways,\" Molinaro said. \"We look forward to continuing his legacy of excellence at Abrazo Arizona Heart Hospital and throughout the Abrazo network.\" Angela Gonzales covers health, biotech and education.
