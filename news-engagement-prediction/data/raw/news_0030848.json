Eddie Howe has some renowned and stubborn all-footballing principles, but with his Cherries only sitting six points above the dreaded drop zone, things are getting a little uncomfortable on the south coast. Article continues below \nHowever, they have spent a fair bit of cash since reaching the Premier League promise land. \nIn fact, the unfortunate Mings cost £9.5 million last season and other big money deals included Benik Afobe (£11.3m), Max Gradel (£8.5m) and Lewis Grabban (£8m).

This time, Liverpool starlet Jordon Ibe was the headlining addition to the ranks at a cost of around £15m. \nYes, £15m. The same amount of money it cost to purchase Alan Shearer - a bona fide world-class forward - just 20 years earlier, could now get you an unproven, yet promising, young English winger. \nThings haven't quite gone according to plan for Ibe since he made his switch to the Vitality Stadium, though, and the speedy wide man has some quite appalling stats. \nIn 19 appearances, the 21-year-old has zero goals, zero assists and just one shot on target. \nBournemouth and their fans could be forgiven for expecting a better return on their money than that, but Liverpool's fanbase took to Twitter last night to revel in Ibe's failings. \nAs you can see, Ibe is not missed on the red half of Merseyside. \nThe England under-21 international does have plenty of potential if he can just find an end product. He is comfortable dribbling at opponents and has all the pace and power in the world, but without some production at the end of his endeavours, he'll never live up to his price tag. \nBut, as you can see by these tweets below, Liverpool fans didn't always hold Ibe in such low regard. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
