Watch out for diversions AP /London Filed on February 24, 2017 | Last updated on February 24, 2017 at 10.30 am Share Vote London's Heathrow Airport said about one in 10 flights was cancelled. Rain, snow and strong winds of more than 90 mph (145 kph) from a weather system dubbed Storm Doris closed UK roads, canceled flights and for a time halted train travel to and from Euston Station, one of London's main terminals. Heathrow Airport said about one in 10 flights was cancelled. An Icelandair flight from Reykjavik declared an in-flight fuel emergency after aborted attempts to land at both Manchester and Liverpool airports in northwest England. It eventually landed successfully in Manchester. The Amsterdam flight also landed safely. Nobody was injured in the heavy landing at Schiphol Airport. Video shown on Dutch news sites showed the right landing gear of the twin-prop airplane operated by Flybe collapsing as it touched down. Schiphol said in a statement that 59 people were on the plane. Flybe confirmed \"an incident\" at Schiphol involving flight BE1284 from Edinburgh to Amsterdam. \"We can confirm that there are no injuries and all passengers have been bussed to the airport terminal,\" the carrier said in a statement. The landing came as powerful winds battered the Netherlands, causing traffic chaos and blowing roofs off some buildings but no other major incidents. Britain's weather agency, the Met Office, said a top wind speed of 94 mph (151 kph) was recorded at Capel Curig in Wales. The wind even halted filming of outdoor scenes on Britain's long-running soap opera \"Coronation Street.\" Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T16:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T08:53:51.356+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
