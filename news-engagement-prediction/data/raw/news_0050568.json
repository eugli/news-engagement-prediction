The show has witnessed the debut of the worlds’ finest of cars and concepts peeking into the future of automobile. Which means, every year you will get to see the fastest of the cars and the most luxurious of them strutting their stuff. With the show starting on March 7, here are a few eye-candies you need to look out for to find your next wallpaper.\nPagani Huayra Roadster\nThe Huayra is probably the most beautiful car to be built these days and now we will get to see one in the roadster avatar. And if you thought roadsters are heavier than coupes, you have been taught wrong. Because the roadster weighs more than 50 kg less and then you have the added horsepower from the bespoke turbocharged V12 engine.\nLamborghini Huracan Performante\nLamborghini claims that this Huracan can better the Porsche 918 at the mecca of supercars – the Nurburgring. This one counts ten cylinders in V belting out close to 640bhp of power. The Performante is the fastest Huracan and Lamborghini will make sure it looks its part with the added aero-props, the rear wing and a whole lot of aggression.\nRenault Alpine\nRenault had acquired the French race car maker back in the day and since then it is home to the Renault’s performance arm. The Alpine brand was put on the revival list earlier this decade and is now set to grace the roads. The petite beauty is marked by its quad headlamps setup in the front and the rounded lines.\nFerrari 812 Superfast\nWhat could possibly outdo the Ferrari F12? One of the most powerful grand tourer from the stable of the prancing horses will now be replaced by the Ferrari 812 Superfast. If you still can’t guess it, the 812 is even more powerful. It gets a larger 6.5-litre V12 churning out 789bhp of power and 718Nm of torque flying past 100kmph in just 2.9 seconds.\nBentley Continental Supersport\nBentley has built a new generation Continental GT and because it is the fastest Bentley ever, it gets the SuperSport badge. The best part is, despite the all new engineering, the British marque hasn’t left behind its lithic charm, the regal design. While the who’s who will not have to crib about the good old days, we will have a beauty to look out for.\nItaldesign V10 Supercar\nThe sportscars from the 60s to almost the end of the last century that really made a mark for themselves were either penned by Sergio Pinninfarina or Giorgetto Giugiaro. Giugaro’s Italdesign is now a part of the Lamborghini, VW Group and is out to reveal its own supercar in Geneva. It gets the Huracan V10, the underpinnings of the Aventador and a whole lot of Italian madness.\nPinninfarina Fittipaldi\nHow could be Pinninfarina be left behind? Well, they are neck to neck with a supercar of their own. Called the Fittipaldi EF7 Vision Grand Turismo, the car is will employ a carbon-fibre monocoque chassis, a carbon-fibre body and V8 engine to keep the weighing scale from tipping the tonne. The teaser images do reveal an outrageous design and you should not miss it.\nZenvo TS1 GT\nZenvo is the Danish take on the whole supercar hullabaloo and the ultra-rare supercar has had its share of fame. Zenvo say the TS1 GT will be powered by a 5.8-liter twin-supercharged V8 engine that produces over 1,150 horsepower and a top speed of, wait for it, over 400kmph. Only 15 TS1s have been built till date so the GT will certainly be unique for quite some time to come.\nTamo Concept car\nThis one is a home-boy. With Tata Motors engineering a turnaround for themselves in their backyard, just like they did with Jaguar-Land Rover. And so we Indians might get the first real sports car of our own. With partners like Microsoft coming in, we expect a geek fest wrapped in evocative curves that peeked out of the teaser images.", "external_links": ["https://imgd.aeplcdn.com/642x361/cw/ec/27230/Ashok-Leyland-Stile-20132015-Exterior-91210.jpg?wm=0"], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T13:45:05.150+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
