Dressed to the nines in a pink suit, the celebrated DJ/producer sat alongside Chance The Rapper and Hip Hop mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs , and revealed the title of his follow up to Major Key — Grateful. The title, most likely inspired by the October 2016 birth of his son, was announced via Instagram, which he teased on Wednesday (February 8). A video posted by DJ KHALED (@djkhaled) on Feb 8, 2017 at 4:14pm PST \nHe also (jokingly?) said his infant son Asahd will executive produce the record as Chance deflected questions about features included on Grateful . Diddy also led the audience in a prayer later as the discussion came to a close. The conference comes just ahead of the 59th Grammy Music Awards, where both Khaled and Chance are nominated for Best Rap Album — Major Key and Coloring Book , respectively. The Grammys air Sunday (February 12) at 5 p.m. PST.
