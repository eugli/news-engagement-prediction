What is going on there – totally out of control. Chicago needs help! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 24, 2017 \nOnce again, it seems that Trump is making a knee-jerk response to media reporting and capitalizing on violence that has plagued Chicago in recent years. His tweet comes on the same day that The Chicago Tribune reported that homicides in the city are already outpacing last year’s numbers. \nTrump’s post is only the latest sign that he remains fixated with violence in Chicago. Last month he shot this tweet out suggesting that he’s open to sending “feds” into the city: If Chicago doesn’t fix the horrible “carnage” going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017 \nWhile Chicago has become a nice talking point for Republicans, including Trump, who like to blame the city’s tight gun laws for the increasing violence, it is loose gun laws in neighboring Indiana – Mike Pence’s state – that drive violence in the Windy City. \nIf Trump is really serious about reducing violence in big cities (and small towns) across the United States, he should consider doing something that study after study shows is most effective: tighten gun laws. \nUntil then, his promise to save Chicago is nothing but bluster.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T08:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:07:45.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
