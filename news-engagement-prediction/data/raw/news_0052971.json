(Elizabeth Chiu/CBC) Related Stories \nA family doctor in Nova Scotia, who was accused of secretly recording an explicit video of a woman using the washroom at the clinic where he worked, is allowed to practise medicine again. \nDr. Rafid Al-Nassar was arrested in November at the Westside Medical Clinic in New Glasgow and charged with voyeurism. It's alleged he \"surreptitiously\" recorded the woman in the staff washroom and captured images of her genital and anal area in March, according to a court document. \nThe College of Physicians and Surgeons of Nova Scotia suspended Al-Nassar's licence following his arrest. Restrictions \nOn Friday, the college announced it lifted the suspension, with some restrictions in place: Al-Nassar is required to have a chaperone present for all patient encounters, except those that occur in the operating room. A sign about the chaperone requirement must to be placed in all waiting rooms and examination rooms where patients are seen. \nThe college's spokesperson was not available for comment Friday. \nUnder the terms of Al-Nassar's release from police custody, he must follow a series of conditions including staying away from telecommunications devices and notifying police of any changes in address or employment. \nHe is due back in court March 5. \nIt isn't known if Al-Nassar has resumed practising in New Glasgow or anywhere else in the province. \nHe received his Nova Scotia medical licence in November 2011.
