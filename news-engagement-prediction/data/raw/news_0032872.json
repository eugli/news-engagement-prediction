She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted.”\nPerry, who repeatedly stumped for Hillary Clinton and performed at fund-raisers to support her campaign throughout 2016, hasn’t been shy about expressing political opinions at public events — and she delivered during her Grammys turn. As the song wound down, Perry was backlit by a projection of the US Constitution.\nSkip Marley, who raps one verse on “Chained to the Rhythm,” joined Perry for the performance. “We gonna call this era Purposeful Pop,” Perry tweeted about the song on Friday.\nRelated Who wore what at the Grammys Beyoncé storms Grammys stage with a regal performance Katy Perry shows solidarity with Elizabeth Warren in Grammys performance\nIsaac Feldberg can be reached at isaac.feldberg@globe.com , or on Twitter at @i_feldberg .", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Farts%2Fmusic%2F2017%2F02%2F12%2Fkaty-perry-shows-solidarity-with-elizabeth-warren-grammys-performance%2FbQELYNgy4aZBCfRsu6u0DM%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&title=Katy", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Farts%2Fmusic%2F2017%2F02%2F12%2Fkaty-perry-shows-solidarity-with-elizabeth-warren-grammys-performance%2FbQELYNgy4aZBCfRsu6u0DM%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%26s_campaign%3dsm_gp%26hl=en-US", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Farts%2Fmusic%2F2017%2F02%2F12%2Fkaty-perry-shows-solidarity-with-elizabeth-warren-grammys-performance%2FbQELYNgy4aZBCfRsu6u0DM%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&t=Katy", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Farts%2Fmusic%2F2017%2F02%2F12%2Fkaty-perry-shows-solidarity-with-elizabeth-warren-grammys-performance%2FbQELYNgy4aZBCfRsu6u0DM%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%3Fevent%3Devent25&tKaty", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Katy", "http://twitter.com/i_feldberg"], "published": "2017-02-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T09:42:23.301+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
