Mitchell, Detroit Free Press) Buy Photo 2 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThe Detroit Lions showed off its upgraded cellular and Wi-Fi service today at Ford Field, highlighting a technology that required installing new copper and fiber optic cable throughout the stadium and that the franchise hopes will fix connectivity problems and improve the experience at games, concerts and other events. \n\"We recognize that access to technology and social media plays an integral role in the fan experience at NFL games,\" said Rod Wood, the team president. \"It is imperative the we provide optimal connectivity for everybody at Ford Field.\" \nThe Lions, who have been vowing for months to fix problems, have faced complaints from frustrated fans who said they could not connect to the Internet — and wireless phone service — to access apps and social media, replay clips, see fantasy football updates and even send text messages and make phone calls during games. \n►Related: Ford Field Wi-Fi will be available to all Lions fans, Verizon says \nTo address the problem, Verizon — the wireless carrier that put in the system in 2012 — said it has quadrupled capacity in the 65,000-seat stadium. It drilled into the concrete walls, pulled cables throughout the stadium, and added antenna systems, some of which are mounted to the silver handrails in the aisles. \nThe wires are hidden inside the handrails and run underneath the stadium.

The upgrades also are expected to provide more tech opportunities for guests, including augmented and virtual reality. \nLions officials said it's too early to talk about what those new tech features or devices would be like, and how fans would use them while watching the game, but they are likely in the future — and the more reliable, higher speed connections likely would be essential in order for them to operate. \nUntil the improvements, access had been limited to Verizon customers because — as the company said when it installed it — it was seeking investment from other phone carriers to help cover the initial $4-million cost to build the network. \nVerizon and the Lions said the upgrades cost millions of dollars, but declined to be more specific. \nThe Lions said that the upgrade cost would not be passed along through increased ticked prices. \nFord Field was the first major stadium in Michigan, and the ninth in the NFL, to offer fans wireless Internet service. \nIn 2012, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said the league wanted Wi-Fi in all the stadiums so that fans could have access to the same information they would at home, including highlights, social media and fantasy football. \nThe next year, the Lions started hyping its Wi-Fi services, which the team said it needed to help compete with the home viewing experience. \nBut, one of the problems with wireless phone connectivity in stadiums, and places where many people are gathered, is that it doesn't work well when many people are trying to use it all at once. \nIt's almost like a traffic jam, and installing systems that worked was more complicated than the carrier initially thought. \nIn addition to improving Wi-Fi, Verizon also is installing new equipment to handle and enhance cellular service through the stadium. For Verizon customers, especially those on unlimited data plans, the upgrades give fans two ways — Wi-Fi or through the carrier's network — to send and receive information,engineer Doug Kwiatkowski said \nContact Frank Witsil: 313-222-5022 or fwitsil@freepress.com 2 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:48:44.213+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
