By Hayley MacMillen Albert L Ortega / Simi Valley Police Department Advertisement - Continue Reading Below On Feb. 27, the former MMA fighter known as War Machine, born Jon Koppenhaver, will go on trial for attempting to murder his ex-girlfriend Christy Mack in August 2014. He stands accused of a horrific physical attack and attempted rape that left the adult star with 18 broken bones, a broken nose, a fractured rib, a ruptured liver, and missing and broken teeth that have taken years of recovery and tens of thousands of dollars of treatment . Recently, the judge overseeing the case, Clark County District Judge Elissa Cadish, gave Koppenhaver's defense permission to present evidence that Koppenhaver and Mack discussed a rape fantasy before the attack. A photo posted by Christy Mack (@christymack) on Sep 14, 2014 at 10:56am PDT The idea that a couple's shared fantasy could help the case of an accused assaulter — especially one who insists that he's innocent, as Koppenhaver (who has said that he acted in self-defense ) continues to do — is infuriating. The implication that a woman's sexual activities or interests could in any way mean that she \"invited\" or \"deserved\" an attack, meanwhile, is horrifying. It seems to be par for the course for Koppenhaver's defense lawyer Brandon Sua, who at one point argued that Mack's porn career meant she had the \"desire, the preference, the acceptability towards a particular form of sex activities that were outside of the norm.\" Do attempted murder or attempted rape count as \"outside the norm\"? Are those the activities that Mack's professional choices implied she \"desired,\" \"preferred,\" and \"accepted\"? Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Neither the prosecutor nor the judge were having this argument either: \"Because she consented to those acts through her course of employment does not mean the defendant is then entitled to think he can do that to her,\" Chief Deputy District Attorney Jacqueline Bluth responded , while Judge Cadish stated that she didn't \"see how any of those activities that she did in adult movies would ever show her consent to the acts with the defendant that he's charged with.\" And yet, Judge Cadish decided that the former couple's rape fantasy has a role in this court case after Sua asked Mack on the stand if she had ever acted out a rape fantasy with Koppenhaver. \"I did actually ask him to play out a rape fantasy one time but it never came to fruition,” she replied , according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal . She added that rape fantasy is \"role play\" and a \"fetish\" in which \"very specific set of guidelines and rules would be set down and laid out before the acts are actually done, for safety reasons and consent reasons\" — which is an eloquent summary of a healthy approach to BDSM . Mack added that she \"wouldn’t want to have an actual rape happen.\" Rape fantasies are common , and prevalence aside, having one in no way means you actually want to be sexually assaulted , and I almost can't believe we still have to go over this in 2017 — or that Mack had to explain her desire to not be raped under questioning from a lawyer. Koppenhaver's defense appears to be attempting to construct a reality in which it's OK to beat porn stars nearly to death because they're porn stars, or in which sexual interests translate to some kind of an invitation to assault. When Koppenhaver's trial begins later this month, this twisted, slut-shaming worldview must not win out. Follow Hayley on Twitter .
