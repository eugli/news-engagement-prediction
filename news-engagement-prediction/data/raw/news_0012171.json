Parxsys Technologies, which installed docking stations at six Metro stations in 2011, gave up and shifted focus to private campuses because of the high annual licencing fee that it has required to pay to Metro Rail. \n\nTenderSURE projects and Neighbourhood Improvement Plans incorporate cycling lanes that could encourage more people to commute by cycling but the city lacks an overall infrastructure that could make this more feasible. \n\nDULT wants to provide cycles, lay down cycling lanes and also set up docking stations across the city , Jain said. \n\n“These point-to-point docking stations will come with smart cards for users and cycles will be given out on an hourly basis,“ he said. \n\nDULT has planned a pilot project at HSR Layout for a 22-km network of cycling lanes at a cost of about Rs 18.5 crore. \n\n“There are a good number of cyclists at HSR Layout. 300-400 cyclists use bicycles as a mode of transportation. This is way this place was selected for the pilot project,“ said Kavitha Reddy ,a resident of HSR Layout. \n\nSyed Haseeb Arfath , a cofounder of Parxsys, said for DULT's plan to succeed, cycling lanes and docking stations should connect every part of the city. \n\n“The authorities should establish docking stations at every bus stop. If every bus stop and every housing colony has one docking station, commuters won't mind cycling the short distance and taking a bus,“ said Arfath. \n\n“A city like Bengaluru needs at least 3,000 cycles and 300 docking stations.“  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T17:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T08:20:17.155+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
