Save Carlos Becerra / Anadolu Agency / Getty Images \nEarlier today, the Venezuelan government cut CNN en Español's signal, shutting off its television broadcasting in the country shortly after it aired a report on fake passports. Not to be deterred, the news network has taken its programming to YouTube and posted links to news reports on its Spanish-language site . Apparently, the Venezuelan government doesn't know that you can't stop the livestreaming signal. \nThe report that sparked the ban, \"Passports in the Shadows,\" alleged passport fraud at the Venezuelan embassy in Iraq. Over a week after it aired on February 6th, the government's National Telecommunications Commission (Conatel) ordered CNN's broadcasting ability be immediately suspended, accusing the network of attempting to \"undermine the peace and the democratic stability\" of the country, according to the BBC. \nThe report linked Venezuelan Vice-President Tareck El Aissami to the granting of 173 passports, including to Hezbollah, which the US and other Western powers have deemed a terrorist group. CNN chose to stand by its reporting.

The network's Spanish-language YouTube channel is currently livestreaming their programming, as promised, and can be seen below. \nAnother Twitter user allegedly recorded the moment Venezuela cut off CNN en Español's signal: Fuera del aire @CNNE en cableras venezolanas.
