ADVERTISEMENT \nTo qualify for the PSEi, companies must have a public float of at least 12 percent and must be among the top 25 percent by median daily value per month or for at least nine out of 12 months. They must be among the top 30 companies in the exchange based on market capitalization. \nAs of Wednesday, Puregold (which trades under the ticker PGOLD) was valued by the stock market at around P122.78 billion while Emperador (ticker:EMP) – which is part of the Andrew Tan group of companies – was valued at P114.45 billion. \n“The inclusion of PGOLD in the main index is expected to lead to an upward pressure on its share price as funds tracking the index accumulate the issue. Meanwhile, the reverse is expected for EMP,” online stock brokerage COL Financial said in a research note on Wednesday. \nCOL has a “buy” rating on Puregold with a fair value estimate of P51 per share and a “hold” rating on Emperador with a fair value estimate of P7.75 per share.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T13:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T09:50:35.221+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
