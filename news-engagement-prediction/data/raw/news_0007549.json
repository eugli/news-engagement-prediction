Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017 \nU.S. District Court Judge James Robart, the judge Trump insulted playground style, was appointed by George W. Bush and confirmed 99-0 . The American Bar Association rated this “so-called” judge “Unanimously Well Qualified” for the nomination. \nThis is the rule of law in action. \nBut not for Donald Trump. The self-described “law and order” candidate and now president doesn’t think laws apply to him. He’s special, you see. If a judge doesn’t see things his way, and by his way he means an inept, bungled expansion of the executive office powers that would embarrass even W., then Trump responds by questioning the judge’s authority. \nSo the president with a dubious academic record (why won’t he release those transcripts? Trump offered $5 million for Obama’s transcripts, so this is obviously a thing he thinks presidents should do) is taunting a man who graduated from Georgetown University Law Center in 1973 as being a “so-called” judge. \nI would put money on the “so-called” Judge knowing more about the law in his little finger than Trump knows even with the help of his closest confidantes, a cheat sheet, and a lifeline, because look at the evidence. But Trump is embarrassed and he doesn’t like having his decisions questioned, so we are being subjected to yet another crazy Trump tantrum. \nIf that isn’t bizarre enough, the President lashed out again at the New York Times this Saturday morning, so he’s obviously enjoying the weekend vacation that you’re funding in part, to to tune of $3 million dollars : After being forced to apologize for its bad and inaccurate coverage of me after winning the election, the FAKE NEWS @nytimes is still lost! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017 \nThese are the things that obsess the new president: How to beat the New York Times into submission, while neener-neenering a federal judge for doing his job as his unquestioned qualifications see fit. Rule of law, bad! \nIt is, of course, Donald Trump who is the “so-called” person in this scenario. He is the person who is uniquely unqualified, unprepared, disinterested in learning, and got into office with the aggressive and illegal help of a hostile foreign agent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T21:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T16:44:43.911+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
