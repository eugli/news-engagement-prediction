and cities across Britain on Monday as MPs debate whether US President Donald Trump should be allowed to make a state visit to the UK. \nThe House of Commons will today debate two petitions relating to Trump's proposed that received over 100,000 signatures. \nA petition calling on Trump's state visit to be blocked received 1.85 million signatures, while one demanding the President's visit to go ahead got just 311,000. \nAt the same time, protestors nationwide will take part in a national day of action organised by the Stop Trump Coalition to highlight the contribution of migrants to the UK and the widespread opposition to the \"hatred, racism and division\" incited by Trump. \nThe main protest is scheduled to take place in Parliament Square, London with demonstrations also set to take place in E dinburgh, Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle and Cardiff. \nMonday's protests will have a particular focus on migrants' rights and coincide with a day of action organised by the One Day Without Us movement designed to raise awareness of the contribution that immigrants make to Britain's economy and society. \n\"The planned state visit should clearly be cancelled – and the invitation binned,\" Caroline Lucas, Green MP for Brighton Pavilion, said. \n\"On Monday evening I will be joining thousands of others in calling out Trump’s islamophobia and racism – and making clear that we expect our Government to stand up to bigotry, not meekly back away from confronting it.” \nPresident Trump sparked global outrage earlier this month when he imposed a 90-day ban on people from seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the US. The move triggered mass protest both in the US and abroad, including in cities across the UK. \nThe debate in Parliament will kick off at 16:30 p.m (GMT) with a statement from petitions committee member Paul Flynn MP, with a response from Foreign Office minister Alan Duncan. Theresa May still intends to welcome Trump to the UK later this year despite mass protests and the petition against it receiving nearly two million backers. \n\"HM Government believes the President of the United States should be extended the full courtesy of a State Visit. We look forward to welcoming President Trump once dates and arrangements are finalised,\" the Foreign Office said last week. \n\"HM Government recognises the strong views expressed by the many signatories of this petition, but does not support this petition.\" \nHouse of Commons speaker John Bercow made international headlines earlier this month when he announced his intention to ban Trump from addressing Parliament in Westminster Hall when he makes his state visit. Bercow does not have the authority to block a foreign leader from making a state visit but can decide who is invited to carry out the customary honour of speaking to MPs in Westminster Hall. Barack Obama was the last US President to do so. \nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron and a host of other MPs backed Bercow but a handful of Tory MPs have publicly supported a proposed motion of no confidence started by James Duddridge MP. \nLondon mayor Sadiq Khan said on Sunday that he supported the petition calling on Trump to be banned from visiting the UK, citing his \"cruel and shameful\" immigration policies. \"I think this ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries, ending the refugee programme is cruel and it’s shameful. \n\"In those circumstances, we shouldn’t be rolling out the red carpet,\" Khan told ITV's Robert Peston. \nToday's debate will not the be the first time that MPs debate whether Trump should be banned from visiting the UK. \nIn March, Parliament voted against a petition calling on the then Republican candidate to be blocked from visiting over comments he made about Muslims. The debate was a fiery affair, though, with MPs using words like \"wazzock\", \"buffoon\" and \"fool\" to describe the divisive leader.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T17:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T13:08:16.368+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
