Photo: Zach Alan Photo Photographer captures epic scenes throughout Texas by painting light around his modeling girlfriend 1 / 21 Back to Gallery \nTo answer your question, no, the light displays in the photos above aren't Photoshopped in. \nHouston resident Zachary Smidt teams up with his girlfriend, Juli, to create these epic photos featuring a technique called \"light painting\" all across Texas. \nFrom the hill country to the bay area to some of Texas most beautiful state and national parks, the couple has been creating the creative portraits in different locations throughout the Lone Star State. \nLIVE FREE: 33 ways to live it up at Texas state parks \nBy using a simple process involving a wireless remote and either a fluorescent light tube, a flashlight or a home-made torch, Smidt is able to create the light designs behind his girlfriend as the camera's exposure is open for no more than 2 seconds. \n\"The biggest question I get is usually, 'Is this Photoshopped?' To which the answer is no! The light shapes you see are all created by hand and Juli is lit only by the light I create.,\" Smidt told Chron.com through email. \"The only Photoshop work is to tweak the coloring and to sometimes enhance the sky.\" \nHis technique is fully understood through a video Smidt created about the photo shoot he and Juli had at Texas' Pedernales Falls State Park . \nHouston photographer takes incredible photos with light throughout Texas Media: Zach Alan \nAWESTRUCK: Photographer captures the majesty of the national parks in black and white \nThe technique he uses for the designs behind his girlfriend is called light painting and he gets his largest inspiration from his friend and fellow photographer Eric Pare , who is a French-Canadian light painter who popularized the method Smidt uses. \nSmidt admits that he not only gets his inspiration from other artists, but also the great city he lives in. \"The number one thing I love about Houston is the incredibly diverse array of so many different talented people you can find here,\" Smidt said. \"There's not a problem you can't solve in this town, as there's always someone around the corner to collaborate with.\" \nTo see the beautiful photography captured by Smidt throughout Texas, click through the gallery above.
