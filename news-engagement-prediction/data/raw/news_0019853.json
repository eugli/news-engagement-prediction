Spurs will harry Liverpool high up the pitch, would could make it difficult for the hosts to play out from the back, as they like to do.\nThe power and energy of Mousa Dembele in the Spurs midfield could be crucial at Anfield\nThe relentless energy of Vincent Wanyama and Mousa Dembele, coupled with the dynamism of the three behind Harry Kane, should see Spurs trouble Liverpool in midfield - but if the Reds can break through that press their dangermen will cause the defence problems.\nThe power of that midfield, and their ability to drop deep to collect the ball while ball-playing defenders beat the onrushing forwards with clever passing, is one of the key ways Spurs can break Liverpool's zonal pressing.\nAttack vs Defence\nThis game features the Premier League's best attack and the league's best defence, but there is a reason that neither is challenging for the title - they both struggle at one end of the pitch.\nTottenham boast the meanest defence, having conceded only 16 times this season - Liverpool's 30 is almost twice as many!\nLiverpool are the league's top scorers, but Hugo Lloris and Spurs have conceded the fewest\nBut Spurs haven't been brilliant going forward. Their 46 goals scored is the lowest in the top five, while their only goal in the past two league games was a penalty. Without Kane, and without spot kicks, they would really be in trouble.\nLiverpool, in contrast, are the league's top scorers, with 52, the same number as Arsenal, but they let far too many in. In part it is their system to blame, but individual defensive and goalkeeping errors have also cost them.\nWithout Harry Kane's goals Tottenham might be in trouble, but they are defensively solid\nContrast in form\nOn New Year's Day, Liverpool were four points ahead of Tottenham, having just beaten Manchester City and on a run of four straight wins.\nSpurs were beginning to recover from a winter blip in November and December, but were still some way off the pace.\nFast forward six weeks and Liverpool haven't won in the league since, while Spurs are flying. Nine wins and two draws in their last 11 games for the north London side have seen them up to second, while Liverpool's three points from five games in 2017 have resulted in a slide to fifth.\nLiverpool have picked up just three Premier League points in five games in 2017\nKey battles\nToby Alderweireld vs Roberto Firmino\nLiverpool's attack relies on plenty of fluid movement, whether Firmino leads the line or Klopp opts for another striker. Whether Alderweireld tracks the Brazilian, or hands him on to one of the deeper midfielders, could dictate the shape of Spurs' defence.\nKyle Walker vs Philippe Coutinho\nAnother question to be asked of the visiting side - will Walker, one of the best right backs in the league this season, be able to cope with Coutinho? The Brazil star loves to come in off the left, but if Walker goes forward, as he loves to do, Coutinho may not be the best man to track him. This could be the most intriguing match-up of the contest.\nKlopp will rely on Philippe Coutinho to provide the spark, especially if Adam Lallana is out\nHarry Kane vs Joel Matip\nSo much of what is good about Spurs is typified by Kane - work ethic, efficiency and passion in abundance. But in their last four games, Tottenham have only managed two goals not scored by Kane, and he assisted one of those, so keep him quiet and they may struggle. Matip has had a woeful 2017 - missing out on Cameroon's Africa Cup of Nations triumph, and not recording a win with Liverpool. He will have extra motivation to turn it around, and will have his hands full on Saturday.\nSadio Mane vs Ben Davies\nLiverpool's attack sorely missed Mane's pace and direct running while he was in Gabon last month, but his return hasn't yet sparked the turnaround they would have hoped for. But with Danny Rose out, Mane might sense an opportunity to get Liverpool going again. Expect Wanyama and Dembele to spend a lot of their afternoon helping Davies out.\nJordan Henderson vs Victor Wanyama\nLiverpool's midfield has not been great in recent weeks, with Emre Can coming under pressure for his place alongside Henderson. Whether Georginio Wijnaldum comes in or not, the home side will have a tough time against Spurs' deep-lying duo of Wanyama and Dembele. Unless they can escape the Tottenham shackles, Klopp's side may struggle to get their game going at all.\nJordan Henderson and Emre Can must step up against a strong Tottenham midfield", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T12:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:46:10.651+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
