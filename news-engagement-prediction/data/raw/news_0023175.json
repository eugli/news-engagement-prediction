Now it’s time to kick your lifesaving quest up a notch and sign up for the National Marrow Donor Program , which helps match potential donors with patients fighting leukemia, lymphoma and other deadly diseases.\nHere are five reasons to throw your name in the hat, if you needed some convincing:\n1. Signing up is easy, even if you’re lazy. You can join in person by stopping by a registration drive or by spending a few minutes on BeTheMatch.org . Either way, you’ll get a registration kit to provide a cheek swab, which the organization uses to identify tissue type and match with a patient.\nPeople aged 18 to 44 hit the sweet spot, as they’re called upon 90% of the time — the younger the donor, the smoother the recovery for both patient and donor, said Lauren Wollny, the New Jersey/New York community engagement representative for the nonprofit Icla Da Silva Foundation. The 45- to 60-year-old crowd can still sign up, albeit for a $100 tax-deductible fee that helps the nonprofit cover costs.\nBradley Cooper urges public to join bone marrow registry \n2. Your odds of being called to duty are slim. Just 1 in 430 volunteers ever even get a call to begin the donation process.\n3. If you do match with someone, the process is relatively undemanding of your time and effort. Once you’re identified as a match, you’ll submit to a blood test, physical exam and pregnancy test, all free of charge. A doctor will then recommend one of two procedures: a nonsurgical peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) donation (75% of the time), or bone marrow donation (25%), which involves surgery and anesthesia but isn’t nearly as horrifying as you’ve heard.\nFor PBSC, the most common method, you’ll receive an injection of the drug filgrastim for five days leading up to the donation. On the big day, you’ll head to a clinic or blood center to have a needle draw blood from one arm, pass it through a machine that isolates the blood-forming cells, and return the blood to the other arm — voila. Depending on the size of both patient and donor, it can take four to eight hours — which you might use to reflect on what a terrific thing you’re doing for a total stranger.\nFor bone marrow donation you’ll head to the OR, where a doctor will siphon liquid marrow from the back of your pelvic bone with a needle. The anesthesia will keep you numb, and though you may later feel back or hip soreness, fatigue and other side effects, you should be back to your normal routine within a week.\nEXCLUSIVE: Bone marrow recipients to meet FDNY donors \n33 photos view gallery Stars who have battled cancer “This is the one that gets a really bad rap,” Wollny told the Daily News. “It’s not as bad as people make it out to be.”\nAll in all, the average length of the donation process from start to finish is about 20 to 30 hours over a month or two — and your own personal case manager will see you through the entire thing.\n4. Minorities are welcome — and sorely needed. People are most likely to match with someone of the same ethnic background since the tissue types used for matching are inherited — and the registry is starved for donors who are black or African American, Hispanic, Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, Asian, Alaska native, Native American and multiracial. If one of those describes your ancestry, go be a hero, please.\n5. People like Briana Lopez. The Fort Lee, N.J., 12-year-old was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia last year, undergoing several rounds of chemo and a bone marrow transplant from her mom before eventually being pronounced cancer-free. But after a relapse in November, Lopez is fighting for her life once again — and desperately in need of another bone marrow transplant.\nNew York tries to increase organ donations to those in need \nThe Long Island City-based Icla Da Silva Foundation will hold combo registry drive/fundraisers for the tween in New Jersey (Fort Lee and Union City), Georgia, Texas and Florida this Sunday. If you’re free and in good health, you should go.\n“We hope to find Briana a match, and if we find other people a match as well, fantastic,” Wollny said. “It’s so simple to save a life — if it was you, wouldn’t you want someone to do that for you?”\nTags: cancer Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T12:33:00.287+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
