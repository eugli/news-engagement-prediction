And every year Tom Brady and Bill Belichick keep forcing the answers to be altered.\nWhen NFL fans consider how much longer the Brady-Belichick duo can keep going in the Patriots’ organization, the remarkable longevity of each is only underscored. The run is sure to end at some point, but no one is really sure when that point will arrive.\nEven former Patriots linebacker Tedy Bruschi, now an ESPN analyst, remains unsure. When asked on Tuesday in the buildup to Super Bowl LI, here’s what Bruschi had to say:\nTom still looks healthy. The game is designed for him to stay healthy. And he just takes it so seriously. It’s an obsession with him in terms of his durability. I think he even said it today in the press conference about his combine and how he’d crush it now. And that’s just his mentality. He’s better than he was, and he’ll continue to get better. So, I’m not going to give him a four or a five, so I’ll say three.\nAnd Coach Belichick, I just don’t see him slowing down anytime soon. I think that he mentioned it today with Steven and Brian being there with him, his sons. I mean I have sons, but it’s a different dynamic. To have them there in the building, I can only assume how energizing it is when you work with them. I’ll give you an example: As a player, when I’m there and staying late, taking care of my body and watching film, I’d stray sometimes and think about my young sons who are at home. And you feel that pull of, ‘OK, let’s hurry up and get this done so I can get out of here.’ But his sons are in the building, so I’m sure that provides a little bit more energy for him. Maybe that gives him an even longer career because he wants to develop them. Obviously, they might possibly have goals of being accomplished coaches in the NFL, so I don’t see why he wouldn’t stick around here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T04:12:05.388+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
