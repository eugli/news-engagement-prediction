He doesn't care that some people think these games \"don't really count.\" He doesn't subscribe to the laissez-faire attitude of Spring Trainings past. In the sixth inning of Sunday's Dodgers-Brewers tilt, Phillips expertly maneuvered around the tag at home plate to give his team an 8-7 lead. \nMLB.com's Adam McCalvy asked manager Craig Counsell if the slide was something the team works on in practice: \"No, we don't practice that one,\" he said with a laugh. \"He's having fun out there. It was a great slide.\" \nAnd Phillips added his take on the play: \"With [third-base coach] Eddie [Sedar] sending me home, it looks like it's going to be a bang-bang play. I'm just looking at where the catcher is, and my first, initial slide, I'm not necessarily trying to hit the plate. I'm just trying to dodge the tag. I mean, I go out there to play to win. I don't care if it's Spring Training.\" \nUnfortunately for Brett, L.A. won the game, 10-8 . Still, that is a man that is hungry for the W no matter what time of year it is. That is a skill that can't be replaced.
