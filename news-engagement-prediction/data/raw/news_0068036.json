Sharon contacted the out-of-hours GP straight away and was told to take him to Doncaster Royal Infirmary immediately. MJ's condition worsened and he was transferred to Sheffield Children's Hospital - but doctors were unable to save him and he died in the early hours of May 18. Sharon said: 'I just sat there and thought 'why?' Why us, why little MJ? He didn't deserve any of this.' Following an inquest into the MJ's death in February 2016, Coroner Nicola Mundy said MJ died from an infection which led to septic shock which caused his organs to fail. Sharon is now one of the many people backing plans to install hi-tech equipment to diagnose the killer disease within a matter of hours - giving better survival rates. Sharon's plea comes after Louise and John Done shared a heartbreaking image of the moment their baby Harry died in their arms after being 'ravaged' by meningitis they thought was a common cold Doncaster and Bassetlaw NHS Teaching Hospitals Trust, the organisation running Doncaster Royal Infirmary, is planning to install equipment which could detect and diagnose meningitis a lot faster. Sharon added: 'Anything that can save lives, children like MJ, then we're fully behind the hospital in bringing this equipment in.' The Â£30K-a-year equipment would diagnose meningitis-like conditions within an hour - instead of current testing which can take up to seven days. The Done family had to make the painful decision to turn off little Harry's life support after doctors told them the infection had left him brain damaged Sharon's plea comes as heartbroken parents Louise and John Done from Bolton yesterday shared images of their baby son who died from the disease. The family had to make the painful decision to turn off little Harry's life support after doctors told them the infection had left him brain damaged. Louise said: 'We didn't want him to suffer anymore. We had a priest come to bless him and then they took him off the machines and we held him. That was the moment he passed away. He passed in my arms. 'Meningitis ravages them before your eyes. It's unbelievable what it does. It eats you away.'", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T15:12:09.879+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
