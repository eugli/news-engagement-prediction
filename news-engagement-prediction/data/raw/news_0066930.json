'Playing Doel-Doel with my brother Ronald, if he was stranded on halfway, I had to get it over him to score, you had to be accurate over a long distance. 'But it was also like Dennis had Velcro on his feet. My quality as a passer and his quality as a finisher, it was the perfect goal.' De Boer was capped 112 times for Holland during a glittering career which ended in 2006 The former Holland assistant manager reflects fondly on his childhood with brother Ronald De Boer, now 46, uses coffee cups and salt shakers to recreate the moment over breakfast in a west London hotel. His point is this - practice makes perfect. With force, he announces: 'I ask my players, 'How are you ever going to score from a free-kick if you don't practise? You might get lucky one time, but you should be hitting 50 balls over the wall every day. It's about being the best you can be'.' De Boer's quest for perfection is the motivation behind his current break from management, much like the one-year sabbatical Pep Guardiola enjoyed between Barcelona and Bayern Munich. He won a record four-straight titles at Ajax but stood down in May of last year before an ill-fated 85-day reign at Inter Milan, which ended in November. 'Leaving Ajax after 25 years as player, coach and manager was hard, but sometimes you are saying the same things, you need a new challenge, like Pep,' says De Boer. 'But at Inter I had to deal with so many things away from football, you lose energy. De Boer replaced Roberto Mancini as Inter Milan boss last summer and hoped for a long stay But a disastrous start to the season in Serie A and in Europe led to his departure after 85 days De Boer is now contemplating his next move in management and feels he has plenty to offer 'Every time you thought, \"Finally, a good result, everything has calmed down\", then comes Mauro Icardi's book (in which the captain criticised the club's Ultras) or Marcelo Brozovic is in the discotheque and you have to punish him. We only had three months but honestly, it felt like a year.' A Rangers fan interrupts to ask if De Boer - who played alongside his brother for the Glasgow club in 2004 - wants to return as manager. It isn't the only request he has fielded from these shores in recent months. Hull and Swansea have made contact, while there were offers from Liverpool in 2012 and Newcastle in 2015. 'I would love to manage here,' he says, 'but the project has to be right. I told Liverpool I was honoured but I was only one year in at Ajax, it was too soon. I needed to achieve more, and I did.' The former sweeper played for Rangers in his career and he has been linked with the vacancy The 46-year-old turned down the chance to take over at Liverpool in 2012 due to bad timing Sometimes you need a new challenge, like Guardiola did De Boer's family home is in Amsterdam. He is married to Helen, who he met on a camping trip at 15. She is the daughter of former Ajax star Arnold van Haren and the couple have three daughters. 'She is my first and only love,' he says. 'Footballers are very popular and it's very easy to go out hunting. You have to stand strong in your relationship.' De Boer - capped 112 times by his country - did not leave Ajax until he was 28. He had won five Dutch titles and the Champions League before joining Barcelona in a Â£22million deal which also included Ronald. Have they always done everything together? 'Pretty much,' he smiles. Born in Grootebroek to father, Cees - a footballer with Alkmaar - and mother, Gitta, the boys have an older sister, Anja. The defender won five Dutch titles and the Champions League before joining Barcelona A family tragedy before the brothers were born shaped the destiny of Dutch football But it is during conversation about his childhood that, for the first time, De Boer reveals the family tragedy which shaped the destiny of he and Ronald. 'We had another sister who was two years older but after just three days she died suddenly in her cot,' he says. 'You can imagine, maybe after two children my parents would say that is enough. Maybe that was fate for us, you never know how things go in life.' De Boer the football man is intense - his humour is subtle - but there is a warmth about his recollection of those early days. De Boer tracks Ronaldo at the '98 World Cup and he was voted the tournament's best defender De Boer admits having a twin brother was extremely advantageous as a player in his childhood 'We have video of us kicking a ball as toddlers and our father was goalkeeper,' he adds. Our first game was at seven years old. We went there on our bikes and I remember we were nervous. 'We started in the fifth team. I scored five and Ronald scored five and we won 10-0! We were soon in the firsts.' So who was better? 'Ronald was actually the defender and I was a left-winger!' he says. 'So they always said me because I scored all the goals, 38 in one season. Our father inspired us. If you were sitting on the couch he'd say, 'Hey, what are you doing? Go outside and play football'. 'We used the garage door - one goalkeeper, one shooting. It made an awful noise when you scored - maybe he regretted sending us out! But I realise now how much it helped having each other - you could always practise. 'We were always together and he is still my best friend. If someone says Frank to him, or Ronald to me, then we turn and listen, we have that instinct.' They were by each other's side as Ajax lifted the Champions League in 1995 thanks to Patrick Kluivert's late goal to beat Milan. The De Boer brothers (pictured) were part of Ajax's Champions League winning team of 1995 Holland's Total Football of the 1970s inspired his style of play and a generation of Dutchmen After winning the World Club Cup in Tokyo six months later, the De Boer brothers, Edwin van der Sar, Jari Litmanen and Danny Blind spoke on the flight home of keeping the team together and winning multiple European titles. 'Then came the Bosman ruling and everything collapsed,' says De Boer, who admits the Champions League win was the highlight of his career. There is, however, regret. Again we journey back to the summer of 1998. After victory over Argentina, Holland were beaten on penalties by Brazil in the semi-final. Even now De Boer is agitated, angry even. 'Our team was as good as the great Holland sides of '74 and '78,' he declares. 'I watched the Argentina game recently. I analysed it tactically, we were so good - Jaap Stam and me in defence, Bergkamp, Kluivert, Marc Overmars, my brother, Edgar Davids the bulldog in midfield. De Boer the manager still has a point to prove and he is desperate to do so here in England De Boer scribbled his fantasy team down for Sportsmail... and he had to make a few amendments to get ex-Barcelona man Carles Puyol in... (4-2-1-3): Van der Sar; Puyol, Stam, Rijkaard, Numan; R de Boer, Xavi; Bergkamp; Figo, Van Basten, Rivaldo 'If we'd realised we could have been champions, then we would have been. 'I played at Euro 92 and USA 94. I remember nothing about them. But I had a fantastic feeling in '98. I wanted to show everyone what I was about and I was voted the tournament's best defender. 'If we had that focus as a team - not just as individuals - then you can achieve great things. Like the penalties, too many thought, 'Yeah, it's okay to lose against Brazil'. 'We were good enough to win that World Cup, we just realised it far too late.' He is equally scathing of his time at Barca, four years which brought just one La Liga title. 'We didn't have a fantastic team, we had fantastic players - Rivaldo, Figo, Kluivert, Guardiola,' he says. 'Not everyone realised you also have to work hard to win.' De Boer enjoyed plenty of success as a player at club level but the national side failed to deliver The 46-year-old highlighted the importance of discipline for every good aspiring manager Over the course of just a few hours, a picture of De Boer the standard-bearer emerges. Call him Holland's answer to Gary Neville, only with the management C.V. to back it up. Within a month of taking charge at Ajax, De Boer had lost Luis Suarez to Liverpool. They recovered to win the league and he built a new side which included current Spurs trio Christian Eriksen, Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld. His preferred playing style has its roots in the Total Football made famous by the Holland team of the 1970s. 'Attractive football and dominating in the opposition half, winning the ball back as quickly as possible. This is what I stand for,' he says. But what about the dirtier side? De Boer becomes animated when pressed on his approach to trouble-makers. 'Discipline is everything, but it's about knowing when,' he says. 'One player at Ajax, Mounir El Hamdaoui, he stayed in the toilet for 10 minutes at half-time then gave me the big mouth. You think, 'If I don't do something here, they're going to play with my balls'. That was it, 'Okay, you're off'. You either win the group or lose it. They need to respect you.' It is hard not to respect what De Boer has achieved in the game. But De Boer the manager still has a point to prove. And he wants to do that here in England.
