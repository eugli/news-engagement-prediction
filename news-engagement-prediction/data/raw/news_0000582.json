Not me! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2017 \n“We are working day and night to protect Iran ’s security,” head of Revolutionary Guards’ aerospace unit, Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency. \n“If we see smallest misstep from the enemies, our roaring missiles will fall on their heads,” he added. \nDespite the heated words, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Saturday he was not considering raising the number of U.S. forces in the Middle East to address Iran ‘s “misbehavior”, but warned that the world would not ignore Iran ian activities. \nWATCH: ‘Single biggest state sponsor of terrorism in the world’: Mattis on Iran \n\nIran ‘s Revolutionary Guards is holding the military exercise in Semnan province on Saturday to test missile and radar systems and to “showcase the power of Iran ‘s revolution and to dismiss the sanctions,” according to the force’s website. \nIran ian state news agencies reported that home-made missile systems, radars, command and control centres, and cyber warfare systems would be tested in the drill. \nIran has one of the Middle East’s largest missile programmes and held a similar exercise in December to showcase its defence systems, including radars, anti-missile defence units, and short and medium-range missiles. \nTehran confirmed on Wednesday that it had test-fired a new ballistic missile, but said the test did not breach the Islamic Republic’s nuclear agreement with world powers or a U.N. Security Council resolution endorsing the pact. \nIran has test-fired several ballistic missiles since the nuclear deal in 2015, but the latest test was the first since Trump entered the White House. Trump said during his election campaign that he would stop Iran ‘s missile programme. \nThe United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on Tuesday and recommended the missile testing be studied at committee level. The new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, called the test “unacceptable”. \nREAD MORE: US ambassador to UN says world should be ‘alarmed’ about Iran missile test \nThe Security Council resolution was adopted to buttress the deal under which Iran curbed its nuclear activities to allay concerns they could be used to develop atomic bombs, in exchange for relief from economic sanctions. \nThe resolution urged Tehran to refrain from work on ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons. Critics say the resolution’s language does not make this obligatory. \nTehran says it has not carried out any work on missiles specifically designed to carry nuclear payloads. © 2017 Thompson Reuters ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T20:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T15:17:53.553+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
