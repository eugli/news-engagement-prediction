Mining tax not to blame: Holt \nMr Holt denied that the National Party's proposed controversial $5 production tax on the nation's biggest iron ore miners constituted its own ploy for political survival. \n\"It's a policy that is the only real policy to help address our budget woes,\" he said. \n\"The Labor Party certainly haven't got a plan and the Liberals will be relying on the sale of Western Power â€” interestingly, One Nation do not support the sale of Western Power so that will be an interesting dilemma for them.\" \nHowever, Mr Holt said One Nation could attract significant support in rural seats. \n\"I think they'll probably poll relatively well, I'm not sure why people from outside Perth want to vote for a Queenslander but that's their choice, they should have the choice if they want to make it that way. \n\"I would suggest to them they think about putting the Nationals in there because of our record in delivering royalties for regions to their communities.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T09:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T05:07:00.344+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
