But in police documents released in October from evidence in the case, Brown admitted to abusing his ex-wife — calling himself a sex-addicted “deviant” and a “God,” with her as his personal “slave.”\nThe Giants dismissed him soon after the case files were made public.\nSitting down with ABC News’ Paula Faris, in an interview that will air Thursday morning, Brown admitted to the abuse but claimed he “never hit” his ex.\n“I had put my hands on her,” Brown said. “I kicked the chair. I held her down. The holding-down was the worst moment in our marriage.”\nBut, he claimed, “I never hit her. I never slapped her. I never choked her.”\nFaris asked about this apparent discrepancy, to which Brown replied, “Domestic violence is not just physical abuse. We’re talking intimidation and threats, the attempt to control, body language.”\nBrown added, “An abuser is going to abuse to a certain degree to acquire some kind of a reaction.” He said he was “fully accountable” for his behavior: “What I did was wrong. Period.”\nAccording to the documents, Brown’s ex-wife told police he had been repeatedly physically abusive, and the two have since divorced.\n“I have been a horrible husband and stepfather,” Brown wrote in a journal he kept before his 2015 arrest. “I have abused my wife.”\nIn the handwritten admissions, Brown said his inability to empathize with women stemmed from being physically abused from an early age. In a letter to friends dated March 2014, Brown wrote, “I have been a liar most of my life.”\n• Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?
