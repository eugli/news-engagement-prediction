Furthermore, users will not have to wait for it as the first three AMD Ryzen 7 desktop processors will be released throughout the world starting from 2 March 2017. \nAccording to AMD, the pricing of the processors will be as follows: \nAMD Ryzen 7 1800X: USD 499 (about RM 2,222) AMD Ryzen 7 1700X: USD 399 (about RM 1,777) AMD Ryzen 7 1700: USD 329 (about RM 1,465) \nHowever, the Malaysian price will likely to be different though as pointed here at RM 2,599, RM 1,899, and RM 1,599 respectively.
