Photo: Bloomberg \n\"Conservative, liberal or otherwiseâ€¦that's what makes a democracy a democracy versus a dictatorship. I think there is a vastly different model when it comes to government and what should be expected, and that's on both sides.\" \nSpicer had nailed himself in advance. \nA former GOP presidential spokesman Ari Fleischer threw up his hands: \"The problem for Spicer is that he already clearly articulated his views on excluding media outlets from access at the White House: Since it's a publicly funded operation, it shouldn't happen.\" \nAs the tempo of the media war rises, the unthinkable becomes possible. \nThe White House is playing with fire. It was instructive that several news organisations that were approved to attend the Spicer briefing, Time magazine and the Associated Press - protested by not attending unless all media were welcome. And, pleading it was not aware of the exclusions, The Wall Street Journal said it would not attend future briefings from which others were excluded. \nThe risk in continuing down this road is that Trump and Spicer could end up with a briefing room full of patsies. \nLeaks cut both ways \nThe leaks are driving Trump mad. But \"sad!\" to know, as the president would say, leaking and anonymous sourcing cuts both ways. \nCNN is reporting that Trump's Chief of Staff Reince Priebus has been gnawing at the FBI bosses, pleading for them to anonymously brief reporters to push back The New York Times and CNN's recent reports on the Trump campaign's contacts with Russian intelligence officials. \nAnd the Homeland Security officials who briefed reporters this week on Trump's migrant crackdown insisted on anonymity. \nOn Thursday, Trump's chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, used CPAC to rail against the media and on Friday, Trump was the main act, using the first 10 minutes of his speech for a rerun of his claim that \"fake news\" organisations are \"the enemy of the people\". \n\"They are very smart, they are very cunning, they are very dishonest,\" Trump told the delegates packed into a convention centre near Washington. \"It doesn't represent the people; it never will represent the people.\" \nDemanding that the media cease quoting unnamed sources, he said: \"A few days ago, I called the fake news the enemy of the people because they have no sources - they just make it up.\" Lest he was misunderstood, Trump declared that criticism \"doesn't bother me\". \nBut this is all very confusing, because during last year's campaign Candidate Trump regularly did no-name, background briefings for reporters; and in the past, he was known to call the New York tabloids, posing as his own PR agent, to plant stories about himself. \nThe administration's acknowledgement that Priebus had discussed what the FBI knew about the Trump campaign's contacts with Russians prompted protests by former FBI agents. \n\"The White House appears to have violated accepted protocols and procedures,\" said former special agent Ali Soufan told The Guardian . \nDemocratic Senator Ron Wyden, who sits on the Senate intelligence committee which, like the FBI, is investigating Trump's ties to Russia, told reporters: \"If, as Priebus claimed, the FBI not only discussed this issue with the White House but coordinated the White House's public statements, the American people would also have reason to doubt the impartiality both of the Bureau and the Department of Justice to which the FBI is responsible. These claims deserve further investigation.\" \nReports say that despite dismissing the substance of T he New York Times ' February 14 report, the FBI resisted Priebus' requests for the agency to make a public statement to that effect. That prompted a request by Priebus to quote anonymous senior intelligence officials in rebutting the Times report, which FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe apparently okayed.
