Video: Arthur Sinodinos says Pauline Hanson's party is a \"different beast\" to 20 years ago. (ABC News) \nSenator Wong said it was not One Nation that have changed since the late 1990s, but the Liberal Party. \n\"Is it Senator Hanson's plan to scrap the GST and replace it with a 2 per cent tax on everything including pensioners and the poor; or One Nation's plan to force everyone to sign a prenuptial agreement; or her plans to fingerprint everyone in the nation and then force them to provide their fingerprint before they can access Medicare?,\" she asked. \nFormer prime minister John Howard decided in 2000 that One Nation should be placed last on all Liberal Party how-to-vote cards, claiming Ms Hanson was fanning \"racist sentiment\". \nSenator Wong said Mr Howard had more conviction and principles than the current Liberal leadership. \n\"This is a government that is prepared to sell out on its principles and to do what John Howard was not prepared to do; to trade with One Nation and Senator Hanson,\" Senator Wong said. \n\"They are desperate to govern with them and they now believe they will not be elected without their support.\" 'You have what is bordering upon an unhealthy obsession' \nSenator Brandis defended the One Nation leader and told Senator Wong to \"get used\" to her influence in the Upper House. The success of the Liberal Party's preference deal with One Nation in WA could hang on how many support staff are available on election day, a political analyst says. \n\"I know you have a sensitivity about One Nation. I know that you have what is bordering upon an unhealthy obsession with Senator Hanson, but Senator Wong, get used to it,\" he said. \n\"There any many issues — I dare say most issues — in which I profoundly disagree with Senator Hanson but nevertheless, unlike Senator Wong, I do find it perfectly easy to treat her with professional courtesy.\" \nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten accused the Prime Minister of \"cuddling up\" to One Nation earlier on Monday. \nThe Liberals and Nationals in Western Australia have a more antagonistic relationship in WA than they do in the eastern states. \nThe two parties are in power together, but they do not govern in a formal coalition. \nThe deal has angered Nationals heavyweights in Canberra, who are increasingly concerned about the electoral challenge that a resurgent One Nation poses in regional areas. 'Get out your tissues', Hanson tells Labor \nSenator Hanson said Labor's attack on the preference deal was \"pathetic\" and said her policies would be judged by the Australian electorate. \n\"Here you are in this chamber talking about One Nation and the preference deal, that is a state issue and has nothing to do with federal [politics]. I think it's a pathetic, I really do,\" she said. \n\"You should be absolutely ashamed of yourself. \n\"The fact is you should get out your tissues, tears running down your cheeks, because you haven't been able to preference deals with us,\" she said. \nSenator Hanson said she had been validly elected to the Senate and the people of Australia would judge her policies accordingly. \n\"If I say anything extreme they will judge me, but you actually judge me because you are afraid you may lose your seat to One Nation.\" \nThe One Nation leader said the preference deal was not an attempt to \"prop-up\" the Colin Barnett Government, and said how-to-vote cards were only suggestions to voters. \n\"The fact is I will not apologise for being a patriotic Australian and standing up for Australian values and the Australian people,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T14:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T09:59:48.624+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
