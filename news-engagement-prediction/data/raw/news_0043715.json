While parts of the interview have already made the rounds, specifically Jolie’s quotes about her divorce from Brad Pitt , the newly released segment shows the actress, director, and humanitarian enjoying a unique activity with her children. For the BBC interview, Jolie and twins Knox and Vivienne removed the fangs from tarantulas and fried them up with scorpions and other bugs to make a meal. “How do you flip a scorpion?,” Jolie joked. Knox seemed less than enthused about the dish. “It’s like dry chips; like flavorless chips,” he remarked after having some. Jolie was in Cambodia to screen her new film, First They Killed My Father , an account of the Khmer Rouge genocide told from a child’s perspective. Jolie adopted her oldest son, Maddox , from Cambodia in 2002. She told the BBC that traveling to the country to film Lara Croft: Tomb Raider in 2001 led to an “awakening.”“I came to this country and I fell in love with its people and learned its history, and in doing so learned, how little I actually knew about the world,” Jolie, who is now a U.N. refugee agency special envoy, said. In a 2003 People interview , Jolie expanded on her connection to the country. “Somebody told me that if you’re going to adopt an orphan, you should adopt from a country you love, because that’s the only history you’re going to share with them,” she said. Jolie’s new film focuses on the country’s recent history, specifically the Khmer Rouge regime, which led to an estimated two million deaths. “I thought that this war that happened 40 years ago, and what happened to these people, was not properly understood,” Jolie told BBC News . “I hope it helps the country speak more.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:57:49.196+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
