We have that again and we’re super excited to get started. \n“[2016] was a challenging year but what we went through made us stronger. What we went through would have torn a lot of teams apart but it didn’t hurt us at all. Yeah, we were upset we weren’t performing well but we still joked around, still had fun, and we smiled through it all. \n“It was a character-building year, and it showed me there is zero ego on this team. It’s easy to be all happy when you’re winning but the true measure of people comes when times are tough. We’re tough.” \nTo pick up her third title in four years, Enders will have to find a way to beat the KB Racing outfit. It won’t be an easy task, as KB Racing teammates Jason Line and Greg Anderson won 16 out of 24 races during the 2016 season. \nHowever, even if she can’t get it done, Enders still knows that there will be a reason to smile after the the nitro has dissipated in November. \n“This year is gonna be great because I already know what we’re capable of and so does everyone else,” adds Enders. “At the same time, I learned we don’t need win lights and trophies to be fulfilled. Being a family, having each other’s backs no matter what, being together through it all, that’s what matters.” 0 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T18:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T03:47:55.167+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
