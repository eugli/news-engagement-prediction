Manju Kapur 's latest book, Brothers begins with the climax! The chief minister of Rajasthan, Himmat Gaina, has been murdered by his brother, Mangal Gaina. Mangal's wife Tapti is grieving more for the dead brother rather than her own husband's plight in jail. The nature of her grief points to an affair - the possible motive for murder ?\nSounds familiar? Of course it does! When Pramod Mahajan was shot fatally by his younger brother Pravin, media openly spoke of an affair between Pramod and Pravin 's wife, Sarangi. Pramod had personally picked his brother's bride at a college function where he was the chief guest. In an unapologetic reflection of real life incidents, Manju's protagonist Himmat also picks his younger brother's wife from a college function.\nJust like Sarangi and Pravin in real life, Tapti in the book goes on to lead a successful public life, while Mangal despite the best use of his brother's contacts, fails miserably at whatever he does. Frustration builds and a time arrives, when he buys a gun, which becomes a point of discontent between the husband and wife. Pravin Mahajan too had bought a gun that Sarangi took away from him and returned under duress. In both real life and fiction, the same gun is then used by the younger brother to kill his elder brother in a bold early morning attack when he storms into his house!\nNeed we labour the point any more?\nWell, this is the kernel of the story. Around it, with her usual deftness, Manju Kapur weaves a tapestry of India - her history, society and polity. The family saga rocks back and forth as she traces three generations of a Jat family in Lalbanga, near Ajmer across seven decades. In that time frame, against the backdrop of World War II, the Freedom Struggle, the Post Independence years, through the Emergency and on to 2010, the Gainas move from rural to the urban landscape, and rise from landlords to political masters. Their connect to the land is never lost, with emotions as well as part of the family always stationed there.\nManju Kapur depicts the complexities of caste politics in both village and city, draws attention to the plight of women, the empowerment of education and the criticality of right contacts. The big dreams of the men lead them beyond their village into towns and big cities. While Himmat's story is one of perseverance, determination, strategy and chicanery, his younger brother Mangal remains mainly his shadow, a thankless cur who is unable to take advantage of any help thrown his way, but bares his fangs at perceived slights. His sense of entitlement to his brother's success and efforts is his true downfall.\nMost of the female characters in \"Brothers' are feeble images dancing at the periphery of the men's lives - existing only to fulfill the men's needs and bear them children. But Tapti rises above the rest as an educated woman with unwavering ambition and an intuitive understanding of what she wants from life. Though a strong chemistry throbs between her and her brother-in-law from the start, her reasons for succumbing to infidelity so late in life and also for consciously stepping away from it later remain somewhat open to conjecture.\nThe mood of the novel is heavy, even arduous, and life seems to hang like a burden, with success and happiness always just beyond reach - and when attained, snatched away quickly.\nAs his uncle says to Himmat, \"You can see how difficult it is to change the condition you were born to. I tried to enter politics. Even though I had gone to jail for my country, it made no difference, and I remained a small shopkeeper. Your father - he fought for the British, went to Afreeka, went to Burma, lost his health, but what did that get him? He is still a farmer. People like us cannot waste a single opportunity.\"\nIt is this heaviness that drags its steps in the book. The story with its scale, its depiction of human struggle, ambitions and raw emotions is mesmerizing, but you walk away with a feeling of the futility of life and high ambition. If one man's ambition and drive helped an entire family to rise above their situation, that man's tragic killing plunges them in a situation more hopeless than they rose from.\nAnd you walk out of the book with many more questions than you walked into it with. For, the author never meant to answer any questions. All she did was depict the intricacies and complexities of familial spaces - as is Manju Kapur's wont in all her books...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T14:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:39:36.477+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
