Here's what we'll be watching. \nIt's President's Day weekend, a holiday originally designed to commemorate the birth of our first president, George Washington. Take a moment to think about that bro, and how great he was. He was a pretty great bro, but also not great, because he owned slaves. Never meet your heroes. EDITORâ€™S PICK Steven Yeun and Nick Jonas Have Your Weekend Style Sorted \nAnd that's all we're going to say about presidents here. Want to watch some TV with us? \nDid you know Planet Earth 2 premieres this weekend? In America, at least. Nature fans across the pond got their fill months ago. But that's okay, because Netflix is streaming the breathtaking original miniseries in its entirety, and it is totally worth kicking back with tonight while you prep for Saturday's premiere. Watch all of it, watch some of it, or just watch this YouTube clip of baby polar bears like 32 times. \nIf you like Chinese cinema: One of the strangest movies to debut this year, The Great Wall is a complicated film that will mostly leave you jonesing for a good Chinese action film. May we suggest Hero , the excellent film by The Great Wall director Zhang Yimou, or the Ip Man trilogy starring Donnie Yen (of Rogue One fame)? The first is beautiful wuxia filmmaking at its finest, and the latter is a set of biopics that play fast and loose with history to turn Ip Man, the World War II-era martial artist who went on to train Bruce Lee, into a freaking superhero . \nIf you are hungry: Remember Chef's Table ? It is back , with six new episodes taking you from South Korea to Moscow to Peru, all of which will make you very hungry, and start rethinking about how you Instagram your food. Watch now: Iman Shumpert and Teyana Taylor can't keep their hands off each other", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:13:11.891+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
