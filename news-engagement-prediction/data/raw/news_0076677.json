Also plays back row and will play 80 minutes. \nNathaniel Roache ($143,600) \nA Panthers favourite with an awesome workrate and plenty of offloads. \nJesse Bromwich ($463,700) \nHis stats speak for themselves. Won’t play Origin. \nSam Tagataese ($188,500) \nMakes the Cronulla 17 every week and very cheap at $188,500. \nPatrick Kaufusi ($152,100) \nThere are forward minutes up for grabs at the Cowboys and he will be valuable over Origin when Matt Scott is out. media_camera Tyrone Peachey is a key player for MG’s Marvels. \nBACK ROW \nI didn’t own him from the start last year and paid the price. \nBryce Cartwright ($497,200) \nA SuperCoach gun whether he’s at lock, right edge or five-eighth. And he’s a Panther. \nTyrone Peachey ($387,700) \nPlays every position but will start at centre, where he had a great season last year. \nSia Soliola ($326,400) \nOne of the unsung heroes of Canberra’s pack. \nTony Williams ($263,200) \nNow at the Sharks and looking for redemption - and what better way to do it than in my SuperCoach side? \nNat Butcher ($160,400) \nStarts cheap. Young gun coming through the grades at the Roosters. \nHALFBACK \nShaun Johnson ($464,300) \nIn for a big year. Has to perform if the Warriors are to make the eight and will form a great combination with Roger Tuivasa-Sheck. \nAta Hingano ($165,400) \nHas the five-eighth spot locked in until Kieran Foran returns. \nFIVE-EIGHTH \nCody Walker ($444,900) \nOne of my great success stories from last year. I even picked him captain a few times and he was great in the Charity Shield. \nJarryd Hayne ($244,700) \nAt the price, it would be silly not to. \nCENTRE/WING \nHad him for most of last year and he scored big even when injured. \nDean Whare ($143,600) \nWill start the year in the Penrith backline. Very cheap for an international centre. \nKalyn Ponga ($122,600) \nIt’s a gamble because he may not start the year but Ponga is in for a breakout season. \nBraidon Burns ($122,600) \nGreat in the Charity Shield. \nRobert Jennings ($143,600) \nBrother of Michael Jennings. Hoping he scores a backline spot at the Rabbitohs. \nBrian Kelly ($122,600) \nElectric runner who is gunning for a backline spot at the Sea Eagles. \nNick Cotric ($122,600) \nHeard only good things about this youngster and the exit of Edrick Lee opens to door. \nFULLBACK \nI’m backing RTS and Johnson to form an electric combo this year. \nMatt Dufty ($122,600)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T11:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T06:36:50.044+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
