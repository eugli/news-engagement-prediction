Back in 2003, Ricky Ponting averaged 100.20 in Test cricket and Watson believes Kohli is fuelled by the same hunger and desire that powered the former Australian captain to such lofty heights. \n“What I know is that Virat hates losing, it’s as simple as that,” Watson told foxsports.com.au, “the only person I know that hates losing as much as him is Ricky Ponting. media_camera Virat Kohli is the world’s form batsman. \n“They both understand that losing is part of the game, but they’ve got a tremendous inner drive to do everything they can to be on the right side of the game more often than not. \n“The reason he scores so many runs is because every time he goes out to bat, no matter how well he played in the game before, he is just going to do everything he can to take his team to victory. \n“That drive, that intensity, is how he plays every single time, and that’s why he continues to churn out the runs. He certainly never rests on his laurels whatsoever.” \nWatson wasn’t always on such friendly terms with Kohli — at least not on the field, with the pair regularly trading barbs when the all-rounder was still playing for Australia. The rivalry they once had has been replaced by mutual admiration, with the 35-year-old in awe of the Indian’s work ethic. \n“We used to go pretty hard at each other because we’re both very competitive and in a way our personalities are quite similar. \n“Now, seeing how he goes about his business is incredibly impressive and there’s no secret to the reason why he is as good as he is. \n“He leaves no stone unturned. He’s always pushing himself to the limit to reach greater heights, not just as a batsman, but as person and a leader as well … I think he’s only going to continue to evolve.” media_camera Shane Watson got to watch Virat Kohli up close in last year’s IPL. \nSCALING NEW HEIGHTS \nKohli has scored double-centuries in each of his four past Test series, so the idea that he is still improving is frightening. More frightening is the fact that is entirely possible. Each and every year Kohli has improved a facet of his game, whether it be developing a new stroke, stepping up his fitness or turning simple Test-centuries into matchwinning ones as he has in the past 18 months. \n“I think somewhere down the line I’ve realised that as cricketers and as sportsmen, we already limit ourselves as to how much we want to do without even knowing how much we can do,” Kohli told Nasser Hussain in an interview on the BCCI’s website. “I’ve always wanted to explore more until I understand what my max ability is.” media_camera Virat Kohli: I’ve always wanted to explore more until I understand what my max ability is. \nNowadays, Kohli scores runs at will but that wasn’t always the case. \nIt took him over a year to notch his first ODI ton and in the Test arena he averaged 22.44 across his first five matches. When he touched down in Australia in 2014-15 — just over two years ago — his average sat at a modest 39.46 across 29 matches. \nLast year was only the second time he averaged above 50 across a calendar year in Test cricket and it was only in December that his career average climbed above 50. He may have all the talent in the world but Kohli is, has and always will be a work in progress — and that’s a good thing. \nRahul Dravid has known Kohli for more than a decade now, captaining the batting phenom when he was still a 19-year-old at Royal Challengers Bangalore. Now, as the coach of India’s ‘A’ and under-19s team he urges all of the country’s youngsters to follow Kohli’s example — to constantly look for ways to take their games to the next level. \n“Sometimes the impression people get about Virat is he can be a bit brash ... the impression is he’s an extrovert who is a bit of a party animal, likes to go out, likes the nicer things in life,” Dravid told the Ring Side View . “If you strip away all of that, actually there’s a guy who’s desperate to succeed, and has got a great hunger and desire to do well in all formats of the game in all conditions. \n“He’s figuring it out, he’s challenging himself, he goes out and improves. If he’s got particular weaknesses in certain areas and they’ve created issues for him … you see him six months later, he will be better at dealing with it. \n“Every time Virat came back to RCB or I saw him in the Indian team, whether it was his fitness, whether it was his skills, whether it was the shots that he played, everything seemed to get better and better.” media_camera Rahul Dravid has watched Virat Kohli develop from a brash 19-year-old to being the world’s best batsman. \nFINE-TUNING THE MACHINE \nThat desire to improve was laid bare after a dire tour of England in 2014, where his love of the cover drive hurt him badly. Regularly nicking off to the outswinger, Kohli finished the campaign on the wrong side of a 3-1 loss with an average of 13.40 and a top score of 39. \nIn his next Test series, in Australia in 2014-15, he scored four centuries and averaged 86.50. Seemingly, effortlessly he was back on track to greatness. But behind the scenes a mountain of work was done. \nAlongside putting too much pressure on himself mentally to perform, Kohli believes a simple problem in his trigger movement was what undone him in England. As he saw it, his toes were directed at cover rather than point, setting himself up to play the inswinger but leaving him weak against the outswinger. \nIt’s the smallest of details but Kohli worked tirelessly to iron it out before arriving in Australia with his toes aimed straight at point with a widened stance that pushed him into a forward press to counteract the moving ball. \n“It’s become natural now (but) it wasn’t easy,” Kohli said. “I was batting about three hours non-stop every day, I had cramps in my forearms by the end of the week. I did that for about 10 days. \n“Just like in golf, they say you have to hit the same shot about four to five-hundred times before you can actually perfect that shot, so it was more about precise practice. I wanted to tune my head to play that way.” \nFor the Australians to stand any chance in India they must find a chink in Kohli’s armour but even if they do it may not be there for too long.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:35:27.766+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
