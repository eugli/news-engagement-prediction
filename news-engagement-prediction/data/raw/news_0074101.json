PHOTO | EVANS HABIL By DENNIS ODUNGA, @dennis_odunga \nA Senator found himself in trouble when he referred to US President Donald Trump as a rogue president in the presence of a visiting delegation from International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank. \nElgeyo-Marakwet senator Kipchumba Murkomen made the remarks when he rose to welcome the delegation that was seated at the Speaker’s gallery in the Senate chamber. \nThe legislators were divided on whether it was in order for Mr Murkomen, who is the deputy majority leader in the House, to describe a sitting president of a friendly nation in such a manner. \nGarissa Senator Yussuf Haji, who brought the matter to the attention of the Speaker Ekwee Ethuro, demanded that the senator withdraws and apologises for demeaning a sitting president of a friendly nation. \nBut Mr Billow Kerrow (Mandera) defended Mr Murkomen saying what he had raised was already in the public domain as the Republican president has been criticized in so many platforms that has been widely captured through the media. \n“Even the US Senate has referred to the president as a rogue president,” Mr Kerrow said as the visitors monitored the unfolding debate, for some moments, before leaving the gallery. \nMr Murkomen maintained his stance on the matter saying America cannot dictate to other countries how they should conduct their affairs. \n‘ROGUE’ PRESIDENT \n“America can’t lecture us on matters democracy because the country itself is under siege,” Mr Murkomen said, before the Speaker interrupted him. \nSenate minority Leader Moses Wetang’ula (Bungoma) said parliament should interrogate its rules of procedure saying referring to someone as rogue does not necessarily imply, discussing the personal conduct of that person. \nDr Boni Khalwale (Kakamega), however, took advantage of the opportunity to challenge the IMF and World Bank to consider how governments in Africa spend foreign assistance before approving further disbursement of funds. \n“For four years, Jubilee has overborrowed to the extent that we have debts,” Dr Khalwale said. \nMr Ethuro agreed with senators infuriated by the Mr Murkomen’s portrayal of the US president and demanded that he apologises for the wrong impression created. \nHe said any lawmaker is expected to seek a substantive motion at least three days, in advance to be allowed to discuss such a matter. \nThe Speaker declined a move by Mr Murkomen to only apologise for the impression the use of the word ‘rogue’ had created saying, he must apologise for the whole statement against the US president.
