The change was intended to help voters who could not obtain identification for a variety of reasons, including disability or illness, lack of transportation or conflicts with work schedules.\nThe revelations come as President Trump has made frequent claims that the nation's voting systems are vulnerable to fraud.\nAn Associated Press analysis of roughly 13,500 affidavits submitted in Texas' largest counties found at least 500 instances in which voters were allowed to get around the law by signing an affidavit and never showing a photo ID, despite indicating that they possessed one.\nQuestionable affidavits were identified in over 20 counties around the state.\nTarrant County alone had at least two dozen. In Bexar County, home to San Antonio, the top election official estimated that a large chunk of the nearly 600 affidavits submitted should have been declined and voters instructed to cast provisional ballots instead.\nElection officials were not permitted to question a voterâ€™s reasoning for signing an affidavit, under a court order issued last year.\nNearly 9 million Texans cast ballots in the presidential election, according to state data, and Trump defeated Hillary Clinton by more than 800,000 votes statewide. That means the hundreds of disputed ballots could never have made a difference in the outcome at the top of the ticket.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T06:54:45.271+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
