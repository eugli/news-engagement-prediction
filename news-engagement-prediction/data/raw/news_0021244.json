By Colby Itkowitz By Colby Itkowitz February 8 at 6:02 PM Follow @colbyitkowitz Georgetown law professor Heidi Li Feldman with two students outside Capitol Hill on Feb. 7. (Courtesy of Heidi Li Feldman) \nHeidi Li Feldman had settled in for the night Tuesday when Twitter started to light up with the news t hat Republicans had banned Sen. Elizabeth Warren from speaking during the remainder of a debate about Sen. Jeff Sessions on the Senate floor. \nShe pulled up a C-Span clip of Warren reading a letter written by Coretta Scott King, the widow of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., in opposition to Sessions’s 1986 nomination — now President Trump’s pick for attorney general — to be a federal-district court judge. Then she saw Warren being silenced. \n“It was an instinctive reaction,” Feldman said. “Here was a woman using another woman’s words to question a man and being told to sit down by a man.” \nSo Feldman printed her own copy of King’s statement and headed for Capitol Hill just before 10 p.m. She stood outside the Senate and began reading King’s words aloud. She shared what she was doing on Twitter and was joined by about a dozen others — who in the darkness had only the glow of their smartphones —and they took turns reading and rereading King’s condemnation of Sessions. \nAs the Senate prepared to cast its final vote for Sessions Wednesday evening, the Georgetown law professor returned to the same spot at 5 p.m. to do it again. \nFeldman, 51, who volunteered on Hillary Clinton’s 2008 and 2016 presidential campaigns, hoped her small effort would inspire others to take a stand when they believe something is unjust. \n“By showing up and doing what you can do, you’re not only participating, you’re keeping collective action alive,” she said. “So people say they are desperate to do something — it’s not that hard to do something meaningful. What I realized is whether it’s one person, hundreds, or thousands, if we have the opportunity to speak up, we should exercise it.” \nIt seems Feldman’s action, which garnered a lot of attention on social media, may have already inspired others. A group planned to gather outside Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s Capitol Hill home Wednesday night to read King’s letter as well, according to DCist. In fact, after reading the letter several times outside the Capitol, Feldman tweeted that she was joining that group at McConnell’s home. \nShe was moved by the positive response it received, with people on Twitter sending her messages of encouragement throughout the night. \nShe also hopes her instinctual act will show that civic engagement comes in all forms, Feldman said. While she believes people should make a habit out of going to rallies or meetings, she said it can also be a spur of the moment decision “like you’re going out for a cup of coffee.” \nRead more Inspired Life:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T06:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T02:07:58.268+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
