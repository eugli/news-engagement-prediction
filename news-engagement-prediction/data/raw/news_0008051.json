His son, Felix, is tipped to be named prime minister in a forthcoming power-sharing government. \nALSO READ: Togo goalkeeper Agassa flees Africa Cup of Nations after thugs attack his home \n\"The information is confirmed. The (party) president is dead,\" the spokesman for Tshisekedi's Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS) party, Augustin Kabuya, told Reuters. \nA pivotal figure in Congo, whose history has been marked by foreign intervention, civil war, coups and authoritarian rule, Tshisekedi's stalwart activism meant he could draw huge crowds. \nHis death comes at another inflection point in the country's history following Joseph Kabila's failure to step down when his constitutional mandate expired in December. \nDozens have died since 2015 in anti-government protests over alleged efforts by Kabila to cling to power and international powers fear tensions could spark a resurgence of civil wars that lead to the deaths of millions between 1996 and 2003. \nAs word of his death spread in the capital Kinshasa, clashes broke out near his house in the Limete district between stone-throwing UDPS supporters and dozens of police, who fired teargas and made several arrests, a Reuters witness said. \nTshisekedi served as a minister under Mobutu before founding the UDPS, the first organized opposition platform in Zaire, in 1982. \nHe was named prime minister four times in the 1990s as Mobutu contended with pro-democratic currents in the country, but Tshisekedi never lasted more than a few months as he repeatedly clashed with the charismatic autocrat. \nALSO READ: AFCON: Le Roy, man with Midas touch chasing Afcon glory \nHe finished runner-up to Kabila in the 2011 presidential election. International observers said the vote was marred by fraud and Tshisekedi's supporters have referred to him ever since as the \"elected president\". \n\"A baobab (tree) has fallen,\" Albert Moleka, his chief of staff during the 2011 election, told Reuters. \"The baobab protects you from the rain and the sun ... people like that can't be replaced.\" \nTshisekedi returned to Congo's capital, Kinshasa, last July to a hero's welcome after two years in Brussels for medical treatment. The UDPS said he returned to Brussels last week for a checkup.
