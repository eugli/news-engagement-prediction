Even back in 2012, when critics treated a Trump presidency like a bad joke, he was using the stunt on Mitt Romney , the 2012 Republican nominee. When Trump met Friday with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, he naturally pulled the same thing.

After struggling to escape Trump's iron grasp for roughly 20 seconds, he finally pulled away, then offered an eye roll that seemed to say, \"Ow!\" and also \"Who is this guy?\" Screengrabs via MSNBC \"Presumably some type of power-executive move Trump uses to demonstrate dominance over his handshaking partners, the pull-in is Trump‚Äôs go-to handshake, regardless of whose hand he‚Äôs shaking,\" Dan Amira wrote for New York in 2012. \n\"You can see that the pull-in turns into a brief, jerky arm-wrestle if the person on the other end decides to offer resistance.\" \nIt makes Trump look like a bully or a weirdo, generating headlines like \"Amazingly, Donald Trump still doesn't know how to shake a hand,\" but it also puts the other handshaker in a position of mutually assured awkwardness. \nWhat could Abe do to look cool or powerful while Trump jerked his limp-looking hand to and fro? Not much. That perfect eye-roll is what saved it for him. \nAnd the internet loved it.
