The nomination of Mr Sessions was eventually defeated.\nMr Spicer was asked about the incident involving Ms Warren, who was told she was technically in violation of Senate rules for “impugning the motives” of Mr Sessions. Observers pointed out that senators frequently said far worse and that several male senators were able to read the famous letter.\nJeff Sessions presses Sally Yates on her need for independence from the White House Mr Spicer told reporters “if she was still with us today”, Ms King, who died in 2006, may have changed her mind about Mr Sessions.\n“We have a lot of respect for her and the sacrifices that she made and the sacrifices that frankly she endured in her life,” he said, according to the Associated Press.\nInsideGov | Graphiq “But I would respectfully disagree with her assessment of Senator Sessions then and now.”\nHe added: “His record on civil and voting rights I think is outstanding and like the late Arlen Specter I can only hope that if she was still with us today that after getting to know him and to see his record and commitment to civil rights that she would share the same view that Senator Specter did.”\nPlease RT! # CorrettaScottKing 's letter in Tweets to @SenateMajLdr .
