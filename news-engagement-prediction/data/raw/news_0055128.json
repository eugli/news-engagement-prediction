He was taken to hospital, but later died of his injuries. \nA 17-year-old, who cannot be named because of his age, appeared at Belfast Crown Court on Friday. \nHe denied murder but said he was \"guilty to manslaughter\". \nWhen another charge was put to the teenager of attempted grievous bodily harm with intent on Mr Quinn's twin brother Michael, the defendant replied: \"Not guilty, but guilty to attempted Section 20 (grievous bodily harm).\" \nThe judge adjourned the case for four weeks. \nGerard Quinn was stabbed in the front garden of a house at Milldale Crescent in the Currynierin area of Derry. \nA court heard last year that the results of a post-mortem examination revealed that he had died from a single stab wound to the throat caused by a broken glass.
