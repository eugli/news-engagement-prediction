Blush & Whimsy lipstick will be included in the gift bags California-based promotion company Celebrity Connected is putting together for the nominees and presenters at this year's Oscars, taking place this Sunday. The business is not affiliated with the awards show, but will give the products to celebrities. Blush & Whimsy, a local makeup startup, will have its line of lipsticks in gift bags… more Photo by Billy Nguyen, Styled by Mandy Garrison Brown expected to receive her first batch of flower-and-gold-flake-infused lipsticks in mid-March. With the Oscars taking place in a matter of days, she's ramped up the production of about 200 products. The product will also be featured in a separate gift suite for next year's Oscars, according to Jasmine Padilla , brand manager with Celebrity Connected. Aside from the awards show, Brown has pre-sold $3,000 worth of her product. When she first conceived the idea last July, she sold 200 samples of her lipsticks. \"I thought, 'If the samples are selling out in four hours, maybe I should make my own brand,'\" she said. While Blush & Whimsy is her current project, it is not her first one. She previously spent much of her time creating events , such as the Diner en Blanc and Christmas at Hogwarts, as president of Heritage Productions. She also founded StartupABQ, among other things. Her Whimsy lipstick line, which is clear in the packaging but applies as a unique shade on each wearer depending on their lip color and pH, will be included in every gift bag given to the event's A-list celebrities. The gift suite next year will have Brown set up a booth where she can promote her product in-person and snap some pics with various star invited to the showcase. She anticipates that that exposure, and Blush & Whimsy's feature next week, will help boost her company right out the gate. \"Celebrity endorsements cost upwards of $50,000 just to get a photograph or a verbal statement, so the optics are massive,\" she said. \"To be participating in this and to get photos and video and audio and potential social media posts is massive.\" Blush & Whimsy is partnered with the Adelante Development Center for product quality control and fulfillment. Brown is working with a manufacturer in Taos, which she declined to name, for her lipsticks. She is also working with manufacturers in Florida and Korea for future products. There are skin cosmetics and more in the works, so she sees next year's Oscars participation as good timing. \"I'm thrilled now that they said I'm in for 2018 because it gives me more time to develop the other products,\" she said. Celebrity Connected is not the only such service present at the Oscars. Distinctive Assets, also unaffiliated with the show, give \"swag bags\" every year as well. Last year's bag was worth $232,000 and included multi-night stays at hotels that cost upwards of $1,100 a night, according to KOAT . A deal between the IRS and the Academy make the recipients pay taxes for the lavish gifts if they are worth more than $600.
