Some of them bad, but a few of them flourish and get passed on to future generations. Listen carefully, and you can hear the music evolve.’ Not surprisingly, the heretical suggestions have drawn the ire of Beatles fans, including music expert Paul Gambaccini who blasts Prof Leroi as ‘preposterous’, threatening to ‘dissect him like a fly’ in a head-to-head debate. Leroi will be presenting his controversial findings in The Secret Science Of Pop, to be aired on BBC4 at 9pm on Tuesday The academic, from Imperial College London, used computer algorithms to analyse singles from every major band between 1960 and 2010 to see how they deviated from the musical norm. And he plotted each on a vastly complex network diagram, with each band linked to who they influenced and colour-coded by genre. After crunching the data, Dr Leroi concluded that the creators of Yesterday, Eleanor Rigby and I Am The Walrus, ‘musically weren’t that important’. Instead, he said it was The Kinks, The Who and The Rolling Stones who had the most influence, paving the way for punk. He said: ‘The London bands dragged aggression [levels] up and transformed the musical landscape. Meanwhile, Lennon and McCartney were writing ditties for prepubescent girls. The Beatles sat out the British revolution.’ He will be presenting his controversial findings in The Secret Science Of Pop, to be aired on BBC4 at 9pm on Tuesday.

FAN'S VIEW BY PAUL GAMBACCINI DJ and leading music expert This is preposterous. Any suggestion that the Beatles weren’t influential is completely ridiculous. Professor Leroi strikes me as a scientist who doesn’t know music. I would happily go head-to-head with him in any public forum and I would dissect him like a fly. The Beatles were the most important musical figures of the 20th Century. And if Prof Leroi is calling Strawberry Fields Forever and I Am The Walrus ‘ditties’, I would like to hear his nursery rhymes! The Beatles made more breakthroughs than any other artists, including the first use of guitar feedback on a record and slowed down, spliced together tapes. They changed pop music more than anyone else.
