By Alex Suskind Planet Earth This enthralling 11-part series captures the last vestiges of untouched wilderness across the globe. Narrated by the ever-erudite David Attenborough, “Planet Earth” acts as both a comprehensive nature lesson and a dramatic thriller. By employing high-definition cameras and complex riggings typically used on major Hollywood productions, the series offers rare and impossibly rich footage, including aerial looks at wolves hunting caribou and wild dogs hunting impala, and the first-ever intimate footage of the elusive snow leopard. Add to Watchlist Life What measures do animals take to survive? That’s the question behind this BBC documentary from 2009. The answer, unsurprisingly, is quite a bit. Just look at the snow monkeys in the Japanese Alps, climbing through the mountains in search of thermal pools to stay warm; or the Antarctic seals navigating their way around floating ice blocks, using their agility and determination to avoid a killer whale attack. Spread across 10 episodes, this series isn’t a complete study as much as it is a selection of vignettes on how creatures of all shapes and sizes eat, procreate and endure. Add to Watchlist Frozen Planet Made by the filmmaking team behind “Planet Earth” and “The Blue Planet,” this series documents each of the four seasons in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, where winds can travel up to 200 miles per hour and the temperatures drop as low as minus 94 Fahrenheit. Though it avoids the politics of climate change, the results are still stunning: male polar bears fighting each other for the right to mate; wolves traversing the wintry plains in search of food; and time-lapse cinematography that gives viewers a glimpse of the transformation the polar regions undergo during the spring –– notably in Greenland, where its massive ice sheets give way to a landscape of sapphire-blue pools. Add to Watchlist Human Planet As John Hurt tells us in his narration for this series, only one creature has made itself adaptable to every terrain on earth: us. “Human Planet” studies our species’ resilience in overwhelmingly harsh natural terrains, where people are not only surviving, but thriving. Take the Brazilian jungle, where tribes drop noxious plant juice into their eyes to sharpen their senses before hunting for canopy animals; or the Sahara, where a young boy and his cattle race against a herd of elephants in a quest for water. But this isn’t a one-sided story. The series is as much about how nature adapts to and transforms around us as it is about how we cope with nature. Add to Watchlist Africa A thorough portrait of wildlife across the African continent, this six-part series aims to be more than just an in-depth safari ride as it moves from the plains of Amboseli in East Africa to the Congo Basin, south through the Kalahari toward the Cape, then back north, up to the Sahara. “Africa” has all the hallmarks of a typical nature documentary –– swelling music, far-flung locations, David Attenborough –– but its uniqueness lies in its exploration of the country’s vast ecosystem, from lizards hunting for flies on the backs of lions to the gorillas marooned atop the Mountains of the Moon, the source of the Nile River. Add to Watchlist Isabella Rossellini's Green Porno Live! Part nature documentary, part performance art, this series from actress Isabella Rossellini uses paper cutouts, costumes, sock puppets and an assortment of props to help illustrate animal reproduction. The result is a quirky and surprisingly instructive tutorial on the finer points of things like how snails release sperm and why male ducks have corkscrew-shaped genitalia, all brought to exquisite life by Rossellini. Originally conceived as a series of educational shorts that aired on Sundance, it has since spawned a book and one-woman show. “Green Porno Live!” combines a bit of all three, giving viewers a behind-the-scenes look at the creative process and the performances themselves. Add to Watchlist Indochina’s Wild Heart After the Vietnam War, Vietnam became one of the most bio-diverse locations on earth –– and the setting for the second episode of this National Geographic documentary that explores the fauna of Southeast Asia. The series specifically looks at how enormous bomb craters left during the war went on to foster an abundance of sea life in Vietnam. Later, we head into Hang Toi Cave, where we’re treated to views 20-foot-tall rock formations and to a hunt in the dark between bats and cave racer snakes with heat-seeking receptors. Add to Watchlist Wild China Though it covers some of China’s most captivating wildlife –– the boars of Manchuria, red foxes outside Beijing –– the lasting images of this 2008 documentary are of people: Mongolian children racing on horseback, fishermen in ancient Manchuria biking across ice-covered rivers, and a Miao family cultivating rice on terraced paddy fields. Co-produced by BBC and CCTV and aired in the run-up to the Beijing Olympics, “Wild China” is an eclectic look at the coexistence of modern and ancient cultures –– and how both continue to adapt and thrive amid China’s consistently shifting ecosystems. Add to Watchlist India’s Lost Worlds The obscure regions of India are the subjects of this documentary, as filmmakers discover the hidden behavior of the country’s animals and the customs of its ancient tribes. Starting at the base of the Himalayas in the north, where bharals crawl along jagged rock lines to avoid snow leopards, all the way to the jungle of the Western Ghats in the south, where a Rudyard Kiplingesque land of elephants and golden monkeys make their home, “Lost Worlds” paints a dense and vibrant portrait. Add to Watchlist The Blue Planet The BBC spent $10 million and five years to produce this enthralling, gorgeous examination of our planet’s largest and most mysterious landscape: the ocean. “The Blue Planet” offers a fully submerged look at life under the sea, showing off never-before-seen creatures like the terrifying hairy angler and the gulper eel, as well as the more recognizable and colorful coral reefs of the Tropics. The show truly shines during its quieter moments, however, when the camera shadows a vast array of species diving through the ghostly abyss.
