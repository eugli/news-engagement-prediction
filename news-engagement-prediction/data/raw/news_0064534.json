Take a look here: A post shared by Shahid Kapoor (@shahidkapoor) on Feb 23, 2017 at 6:09am PST \n“Last day madness,” he captioned the pic on his Insta handle. Doesn’t he look cute AF? Like I mentioned before that he has shared a couple of videos initially too but I think this one is the best of them all. Rangoon is releasing tomorrow on March 24 and there is much anticipation about the film. Vishal Bhardwaj, who has given us films like Kaminey and Haider, has helmed Rangoon which also stars Saif Ali Khan and Kangana Ranaut in lead roles. The film is set in the backdrop of Second World War when Japanese forces attacked India from the Northeast frontier of the country. As the tagline suggests, Rangoon is based on Love, War and Deceit. The film explores a love triangle between Shahid, Kangy and Saif’s characters. The movie screening was held yesterday and Aanand L Rai, Randeep Hooda, Suniel Shetty are all praise for the film. Kareena Kapoor Khan too has watched the film already two days ago and well, she was all praise for hubby Saif and Kangana and Shahid’s performance. \nWe don’t know if Rangoon will be a big hit or no, but what we sure do know is we would love to see more such video Shahid.. Keep’em coming! <3", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:26:41.286+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
