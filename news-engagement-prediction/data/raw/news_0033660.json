To suggest Australia can reach a different conclusion is quite unbelievable.\" \nThe animal welfare scientists, Dr Jean-Loup Rault and Professor Paul Hemsworth of the University of Melbourne, have reportedly been satisfied with the revised draft paper. \nBut that's not enough for Dr Goodfellow. \n\"What we're not satisfied with is that the standards still do not reflect the science,\" he said. \n\"Yes the support paper for cages has now been revised including an acknowledgement that the hen welfare cannot be met in a barren battery cage. \n\"But the draft standards do not reflect that conclusion.\" \nIt's a period of major change for the egg industry, as it responds to a consumer shift to free range. \nThe share of caged eggs sales last year fell below 50 per cent for the first time. \nThe RSPCA is now threatening to quit the process unless an objective scientific review of cages is done, and the phasing out of cages is begun. \n\"If the standards are not based on current science then the RSPCA will reconsider whether it plays a role on setting the animal welfare standard,\" Dr Goodfellow said. \nWhen asked directly if the RSPCA would walk out, he said \"potentially\". \"Eggshaustive\" process says egg farm lobby \nCaged egg farmers last year spoke out and said their production method was misunderstood and demonised . \nThe industry lobby group Egg Farmers of Australia has defended the process of reviewing animal welfare as independent and run by government departmental secretaries. \nWith an exaggerated emphasis on eggs, Egg Farmers of Australia chief executive John Dunn said the process was \"eggshaustive, and important\". \n\"It's facilitated by state and territory governments from across Australia and will involve discussion with industry, government and animal welfare,\" he said. \n\"It's a collaboration and we think it's robust.\" \nMr Dunn said egg farmers would continue with caged production, because it was cheaper for consumers. \n\"We still have 24 per cent of supermarket shoppers who always buy caged eggs,\" he said. \n\"It's important to understand their motivation as it's the cheapest form of protein it continues to be an important staple in a healthy diet.\" \nAnimal Health Authority, the project manager for establishing the new guidelines for poultry welfare, said it was keen to keep the RSPCA at the table. \n\"The process isn't flawed from the start, and the science is robust, and caged eggs was part of this process,\" chief executive Kathleen Plowman said. \n\"There was a concern that they did raise and I do believe that it has been sufficiently reviewed. \n\"And in fact one of the scientists who originally brought this to our attention, Dr Rault, he was involved in the revision of the supporting paper to address these concerns, to make sure the latest scientific evidence on caged systems was included.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T21:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T05:38:07.159+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
