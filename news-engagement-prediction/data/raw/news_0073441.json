Listed below is the release date for the set, the box art, and all of the special features you can feast your eyes on because, remember, Blu-Rays are built on special features. \nLet’s get the marquee news out there (hat tip to Screen Rant ): Rogue One hits Digital HD on March 24 and then a physical release arrives just over a week later on April 4. Before you get to grips with the bounty of special features, check out the nifty-looking Blu-Ray box art. Pretty cool, right? \nThe special features range from extended profiles of the Rogue One’s motley crew, to an in-depth look at how those CGI characters were brought to life (if you haven’t already seen it) and even a magnified look at any Easter eggs you may have missed. \nThere’s are still things missing that you’d come to expect from a physical release at this point: There’s no director’s commentary and no sign of any deleted scenes, despite extensive reshoots - and the trailers including roughly a billion shots not found in the final cut.
