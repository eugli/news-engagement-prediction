As much as the first fall was scary, the second one is hilarious — provided the cheerleader wasn’t injured any further.\nShe was reportedly receiving medical attention after being carried off the court. Hopefully all involved, including the arena employee who appeared to trip on a stray photographer seating pad, can laugh about the mishap later.\nMore on Yahoo Sports:\n• Tiger Woods suffers another setback\n• Raiders say they still have financing to move to Las Vegas, but who is paying for it?\n• Is there a Trump connection to a group possibly buying the Miami Marlins ?\n• NFL mock draft: Four QBs in Round 1", "external_links": ["https://yhoo.it/2kbnftT&quot;", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/UCLA?src=hash", "https://yhoo.it/2lwQh3z", "https://t.co/FM7WbZ7LCR", "https://yhoo.it/2kbnftT", "https://yhoo.it/2kcUkks", "https://yhoo.it/2kcUkks&quot;", "https://yhoo.it/2lwQh3z&quot;", "https://yhoo.it/2kcEF4C&quot;", "https://yhoo.it/2kcEF4C", "https://twitter.com/SportsFunhouse/status/829907379470925824", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/eOg3gGtGf1POYLur.Nl56w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzEyO2g9NDE4/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/f8b9df2881c6a0128d138461e0f7b799"], "published": "2017-02-10T12:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:21:11.046+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
