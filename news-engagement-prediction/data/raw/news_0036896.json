Sources say Kardashian has been constantly fighting with his fiancée after Chyna moved out of their shared home with their newborn daughter, Dream , over the holidays. \n“Rob thinks it’s the right decision,” an insider says of the latest fallout. “Chyna has disappeared for days at a time without communicating or providing any updates. This won’t end well.” 14 Photos » \nAnother source adds that Chyna has been “yelling and screaming about how his family doesn’t like or support her, and his insecurities.” \nOn Valentine’s Day, Chyna only shared a photo of her mom with rose pedals arranged into the shape of the heart. The mother-of-two did not specify who had sent the flowers. A post shared by blacchyna snapchats (@blacchynasnapchats) on Feb 15, 2017 at 5:37pm PST \nBreakup rumors started swirling earlier this month when Chyna was spotted getting cozy with another man at a Super Bowl viewing party in Los Angeles.
