On his show Thursday night, Fallon didn’t hold back with a sketch lampooning Trump’s combative, falsehood-filled press conference earlier in the day.\n“First of all, you’re all fake news, I hate you all very much, and thank you for being here,” Fallon said. “First question, ‘No.’ Next.”\nIn between responses to questions about his administration’s first month in office and its ties to Russia, Fallon took sips of water from a comically tiny hand.\nBy the end of the sketch, Fallon resorted to using a random answer generator.\n“You know what, for this question, I’m going to have to get out my Magic Trump 8 ball,” Fallon said, pausing to shake the ball for guidance his canned answer. “Fake news, fake news, big league, big leaks, bigly big leaks, China, all signs point to sad. One more shake, and this is going to make the ratings go through the roof, faux news.”", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/qkoVHY43HkU?feature=oembed"], "published": "2017-02-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T22:33:57.368+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
