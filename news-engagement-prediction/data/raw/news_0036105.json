It's not a fair question,\" Trump said, interrupting Turx mid-sentence. \"Okay, sit down. I understand the rest of your question.\"\n\"I am the least anti-Semitic person you have ever seen in your entire life,\" Trump added. \"I am the least racist person.\"\nTurx tried to follow up on his original question, but he was rebuffed each time with an order to be \"quiet.\"\n\"See? He lied about he was going to get up and ask a very straight and simple question. So, you know, welcome to the world of the media,\" Trump said. \"I hate the charge. I find it repulsive. I hate even the question because people who know me, and you heard [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu] yesterday … he said, 'I've known Donald Trump for a long time,' and then he said, 'Forget it.'\"\n\"So you should take that instead of having to get up to ask a very insulting question like that,\" he added.\nTurx, for his part, maintains that he in no way meant to imply that Trump was responsible for the uptick in anti-Semitism. Rather, he meant only to ask the president for his thoughts on the matter.\n\" President Trump clearly misunderstood my question. This is highly regretful and I'm going to seek clarification,\" Turx said later on social media .\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Shep Smith defends media against Trump \nFox News anchor Shepard Smith went off-script during his Thursday afternoon show to defend reporters after President Trump lambasted the media at a press conference earlier in the day.\n\"It's crazy what we're watching every day. It's absolutely crazy. [Trump] keeps repeating ridiculous, throwaway lines that are not true at all and sort of avoiding this issue of Russia as if we're some kind of fools for asking the question. Really? Your opposition was hacked and the Russians were responsible for it and your people were on the phone with Russia on the same day it was happening and we're fools for asking the questions? No, sir. We are not fools for asking these questions and we demand to know the answer to this question,\" Smith\nBy Anna Giaritelli • 02/16/17 5:15 PM The sad thing is that this was plainly evident from Turx's questioning. It'd do the president some good to listen more closely next time, and to resist the urge to assume the intentions of others.\nTop Story President Trump unleashed Trump's aggressive stance toward the media and freewheeling campaign style is back.\nBy Sarah Westwood • 02/16/17 1:18 PM Share Tweet Mail Print SMS More Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T21:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:29:34.157+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
