Mr Odinga on Tuesday announced that the alliance will hold rallies across the country, with the first stop being Bomet. He said the rally will be held on Mr Ruto's request. “We will be guests of Governor Isaac Ruto,” Mr Odinga said when he announced the formation of the alliance. WORK WITH ALLIES On Tuesday, Mr Ruto was quoted saying he would work with his allies to deny the Jubilee Party breathing space in the South Rift and beyond. He spoke in Emurua Dikirr constituency, where he joined MP Johana Ngeno and his Narok West counterpart Patrick Ntutu to launch the construction of the Murkan-Chebara-Soget road and distribute funds to women's groups. \"We welcome Nasa because it is their democratic right to campaign anywhere in the country. South Rift is not a preserve of some political outfits that lack respect for the electorate and elected leaders,\" said Mr Ruto. \"We will ensure we suffocate Jubilee in Bomet and Narok counties. They have shown us clearly that they have no value for us,” he said. ONCE BITTEN The governor said Jubilee has nothing in terms of development for South Rift residents and urged voters from the region to support a party that had a clear development plan for them. \"We have always told President Uhuru Kenyatta that we support him. \"But he might be in for a rude shock during the August general election if he continues sending us political brokers to intimidate, abuse and disrespect us,\" said Mr Ruto. He added that the South Rift people will not be taken for a ride again and told Jubilee to brace for tough times in the region if the president does not heed their call. \"All that we are demanding is respect. The political brokers working with the President have always felt too big for us. We will not allow this to go on,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T16:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T15:42:34.576+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
