But an official whistled Celtics guard Marcus Smart for a questionable foul with 0.9 seconds remaining, and Butler drilled both free throws to send Boston to a 104-103 loss .

I ran on the court,‚Äù point guard Isaiah Thomas said after the game, via The Boston Herald. ‚ÄúI might have been the first one on the court, and then you see (the ref) raise his hand up like it was a foul.‚Äù \nThe ref‚Äôs late call was bad enough to make normally subdued head coach Brad Stevens say a naughty word. @ALawRadio Right reaction from Brad Stevens after the game was stolen from the Celtics‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/jtJREWrkzw \n‚Äî Dan Jensen (@djenott) February 17, 2017 \nThomas, who finished with a game-high 29 points, insisted even the Bulls thought they had lost after Butler missed his shot. \n‚ÄúThe Bulls were even shocked,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs horrible, man, when it costs you a game you should have won. That‚Äôs a bad call.‚Äù \nHe apparently still was stewing about the call after leaving the arena, too. SMH \n‚Äî Isaiah Thomas (@Isaiah_Thomas) February 17, 2017 \nSmart didn‚Äôt say either way whether he hit Butler‚Äôs elbow, but he was as puzzled and frustrated as the rest of his Celtics teammates. \n‚ÄúWhen Jimmy shot the ball I heard him scream, ‚ÄòNo foul?‚Äô‚Äù Smart said after the game, via the Herald. ‚ÄúAs soon as he said that the whistle blew and I looked. And I saw him raise his hand up with the foul. And I just couldn‚Äôt believe it. \n‚Äú‚Ä¶ It was a big letdown. Especially for me. I‚Äôm one of the best defenders in this league. I played helluva great defense right there. I know I did. I moved my feet. I did everything right. My hands were up. I got punished for playing good (defense), I guess.‚Äù \nThumbnail photo via Dennis Wierzbicki/USA TODAY Sports Images \nHave a question for Darren Hartwell?
