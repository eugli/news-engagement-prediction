(Tyson Koschik/CBC)\n\"This is amazing for Winnipeg — to experience world-class sculpture and to realize that our climate attracts this kind of talent.\"\nOriginally from London, England, Kapoor is famous for his iconic works like Cloud Gate — the silver sculpture in Chicago's Millennium Park nicknamed \"The Bean\" because of its shape — and Orbit , a metal tower that featured prominently in the 2012 London Olympics and is Britain's largest public art piece.\nAnish Kapoor creates warming hut for Winnipeg river trail The sculpting team for Stackhouse was led by Italian-born Norwegian architect Luca Roncoroni, whose recent creations include the Victorian Apartment at Icehotel in Sweden.\n\"We were thrilled when Anish Kapoor and his studio agreed to participate in warming huts,\" said Peter Hargraves, the competition's producer.\n\"First a Frank Gehry and now an Anish Kapoor — both done in ice and disappear — it confirms for us that Winnipeg's unique setting holds significant intrigue even in the minds of the greatest artists in the world.
