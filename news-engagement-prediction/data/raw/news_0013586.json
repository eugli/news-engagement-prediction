Elizabeth Warren on Monday blasted the process Republicans are using to get Betsy DeVos confirmed as the next education secretary, and complained on the Senate floor that DeVos is the worst choice imaginable for the job.\n\"It is difficult to imagine a worse choice to head the Department of Education,\" she said on the Senate floor. \"Betsy DeVos doesn't believe in public schools. Her only knowledge of student loans seems to come to her own financial investments connected to debt collectors who hound people with student loans.\"\nWarren argued that in her confirmation hearing, DeVos showed she was \"embarrassingly unprepared\" to enforce federal education laws. That has \"terrified families\" that DeVos might not do enough to enforce laws that ensure people have equal access to education across the country.\nAside from having \"no experience\" with federal education law, Warren said DeVos is pushing to stay connected to companies that profit off federal education policy.\nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox.\nSorry, there was a problem processing your email signup.
