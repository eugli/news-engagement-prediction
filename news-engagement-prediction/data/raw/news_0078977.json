A few of them had extremely tiny penises (like micropenis status),” one young woman said. \nHowever, the co-operative lady was keen to find ways around the issue if she felt strongly for the individual. \n“I ended things with them for entirely different reasons. I definitely would have been willing to work around the small penis if I really felt a connection with either of them,” she added. GETTY These women posted their experiences to Reddit ‘Personality matters’ \n“If I met them and grew to know and like them for their personality, humour and a nice body would def [sic] help. I think I could enjoy it,” one woman wrote. ‘If it does’t feel good don’t do it’ \nOne woman was much more realistic. She said: “I’m going to say what no one else seems to be willing to: sometimes sex IS make or break.” \nShe added: “I would say give it a shot, but if it really isn't working and if it really doesn't feel good, then it's probably not worth your time continuing on with a relationship with this individual. At least not a romantic one. Sex is a HUGE part of intimacy and intimacy is a huge part of any romantic partnership.” ‘Depends on your angle’ \n“I slept with a guy who had a very small penis,” one woman wrote, who enjoyed the experience immensely. \n“He put me into some positions I'd never been in before and it was great!

Do you recognise the symptoms? \nA buried penis is when the shaft of the penis is partly or completely hidden by the bulk of the body. In other terms it looks as though the penis has retracted back into the pubic fat. \nIt was first described in 1919 as when the “when the penis, lacking its proper sheath of skin, lies buried beneath the integument of the abdomen, thigh or scrotum.” \nIt can effect infants congentially and adults - but in adults it is usually caused later in life and is down to another condition.
