The sex abuse case against the men centres on a decision by May, when she was home secretary, to strip the men’s citizenship “for the public good.”(Reuters) \nFour men convicted of grooming girls for sex in a case that fuelled racial tensions in Britain face deportation to Pakistan after a judge on Thursday upheld a government decision to strip them of British citizenship. \nThe ruling by an immigration tribunal clears the way for the men, all of Pakistani nationality, to be removed from Britain. They acquired British citizenship by naturalisation. \nThey were among nine men of Pakistani and Afghan descent convicted of luring girls as young as 13 into sexual encounters using alcohol and drugs. They were based in Rochdale, in northern England. \nAmong the four facing deportation is ringleader Shabir Ahmed, sentenced in 2012 to 22 years in jail. The other three are Adil Khan, Qari Abdul Rauf and Abdul Aziz. \nAhmed, who was convicted of rape as well as other charges, remains in custody, while the other three men have been released on license to serve their sentences outside of jail. Highlights A judge upheld a government decision to strip them of British citizenship They were among nine men of Pakistani and Afghan descent convicted in the case They lured girls as young as 13 into sexual encounters using alcohol and drugs The five victims of the gang who gave evidence in the 2012 trial were all white \nKhan, Rauf and Aziz were convicted on conspiracy and trafficking for sexual exploitation charges. Aziz was not convicted of having sexual intercourse with any child. \nThe judge at the hearing in the upper tribunal of the Immigration and Asylum Chamber, Mr Justice Bernard McCloskey, described their crimes as “shocking, brutal and repulsive.” \nHis decision rejected claims concerning human rights laws and a complaint of “disproportionate interference” with their rights. \nThe case centres on a decision by Prime Minister Theresa May, when she was home secretary, to strip the men’s citizenship “for the public good.” \nThe five victims of the gang who gave evidence in the 2012 trial were all white, and spoke of being raped, assaulted and traded for sex, being passed from man to man, and sometimes being too drunk to stop the abuses. \nThe men, ranging in age from 22 to 59, used various defences, including claiming the girls were prostitutes. \nThe decision on Thursday was the first step in what could be a drawn-out process, and the Home Office must fulfill a number of steps before the men can be lawfully deported. The four men can apply for permission to appeal the judge’s decision. \nMcCloskey told the hearing that the road to removing the men from Britain “involved all of the formalities, procedures, rights and protections which decisions of this kind entail.” \nRochdale lawmaker Simon Danczuk said the four men who appeared at the tribunal on Thursday should be deported to Pakistan as soon as possible. \n“Foreign-born criminals should not be able to hide behind human rights laws to avoid deportation,” Danczuk said. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T04:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:53:36.543+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
