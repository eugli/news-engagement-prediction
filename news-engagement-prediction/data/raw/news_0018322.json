Check it out in the player below! \nRELATED: New Logan Trailer: Hugh Jackman Slices and Dices the Post-Apocalypse \nSet in the near future, the film follows a weary Logan (Jackman) as he cares for an ailing Professor X ( Sir Patrick Stewart ) in a hideout on the Mexican border. But Logan’s attempts to hide from the world and his legacy are up-ended when a young mutant arrives, being pursued by dark forces. \nLittle else is still known about the film’s plot despite its trailer, though we know that the primary villains for the film will include The Reavers as well as Wolverine’s favorite group, Weapon X. The film also has a role for the comics’ Wolverine clone, X-23. She’s played in Logan by Dafne Keen, but it remains to be seen exactly how closely the big screen version of the character will stick to the source material. \nAlso starring Eriq La Salle, Stephen Merchant , Elise Neal and Elizabeth Rodriguez, Logan is coming to theaters on March 3, 2017. Directed by James Mangold ( Walk the Line , The Wolverine ) and scripted by David James Kelly, the new film will mark the ninth (and said to be final) time that Jackman has played the Marvel Comics character on the big screen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T07:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T04:42:50.777+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
