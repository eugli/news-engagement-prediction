It’s just time for her to get off Facebook and just chill. Just chill in her chair. There’s still gonna be a lot of support out here, with my sister and mum and I’m still gonna be here for her.”\nHe closes the video by saying “for now it’s goodbye”, and giving his Nan a kiss on the cheek.\nOf the dance video that went viral last year, Jarryd said it was originally intended just for family.\nHe posted it to them with the words “she can’t remember much but she still knows how to move”.\nmedia_camera Jarryd Stoneman and Nan embrace as the dance begins.

The pair share a long hug.\n“She can’t walk but she can dance,” says Jarryd, as he returns to his feet and the song continues.\n“Still got it, hey Nanny.”\nWhen the song ends, he retrieves her walking frame, kisses her gently on the head, and they head off for breakfast.\nThe love between the pair shines through.\nOriginally published as ‘You’re getting tired hey, my Nan’", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/jarryd.stoneman?pnref=story", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/49c404e8b85a41e0519a83ec30be2d73?width=650", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/17156708359e7bec712ac3860b06e60a?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storybody/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FHahanatv%2Fvideos%2F1576077479378718%2F&show_text=0&width=400", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/740053d7183c96f3864649429110c6fa?width=650", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/its-time-for-nanny-to-retire-from-facebook-fame/news-story/17156708359e7bec712ac3860b06e60a"], "published": "2017-02-22T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:54:39.572+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
