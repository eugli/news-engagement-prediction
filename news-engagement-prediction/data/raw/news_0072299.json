McGinnis Miuccia Prada is known for pulling together disparate references, and her Fall 2017 collection did not disappoint on that front. Among the looks on her runway in Milan tonight were a series of prints pulled from paperback novels of the ‘60s, drawn by renowned illustrator Robert E. McGinnis. Looks 30 to 34 featured McGinnis’s depictions of bombshells in various states of alluring undress, each featured on the covers of mid-century books by Brett Halliday (and one by Erle Stanley Gardner) with salacious titles like Murder and the Married Virgin and Never Kill a Client . Titillating! McGinnis’s artwork was also featured in Prada’s set this season, with some of his famous works collaged in the Via Fogazzaro show space alongside modern photography and maps. If these pinups seem familiar, it might be because in addition to having a fruitful career illustrating paperback covers, McGinnis is also the artist behind a vast majority of James Bond book covers and the iconic Breakfast at Tiffany’s movie poster. The art for Breakfast at Tiffany’s was the now-91-year-old McGinnis’s first-ever film poster job. In the years since, he made the posters for films as varied as Barbarella and The Incredibles . He’s also an accomplished painter, the subject of a documentary, and a member of the Society of Illustrators, but those are just the facts. What really resonates about McGinnis’s work is his fluid, candid depictions of female sexuality—an idea both he and Mrs. Prada love to plumb for inspiration.
