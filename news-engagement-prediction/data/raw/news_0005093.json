14:17 EDT Barramundi fishermen are keen to start their season. - ABC \nFishermen in northern Australia had a spring in their step as they headed out to their fishing grounds early for the start of barramundi season this week.The season starts at noon on Wednesday after a four-month closure to allow the fish to spawn and recruit new stocks.After several dry years in northern Australia, rain returned at the start of the year, causing rivers to burst their banks.Gulf of Carpentaria commercial fisher David Lane, who has been fishing gulf waters for the past 30 years, said the running rivers should make for better fishing.\"Talking to a couple of people the other day, they're all quite excited because of the rain,\" Mr Lane said.He said there needed to be more rain across February and March to keep the season going.\"Hopefully in the next couple of weeks, going on what the [Bureau of Meteorology] is saying, the monsoon will come back over us and we'll get some more rainfall,\" he said.Low barramundi catches in recent yearsWith dry weather in recent years, barramundi catches have been down, and last year fishermen returned to port early because it was not worth fishing.Mr Lane said he had to cut down on costs to pull through the past years.\"We've been down on catch quite significantly compared to the rain periods,\" he said.\"But we've managed to survive by just cutting costs and doing things like that.\"James Cook University professor Dean Jerry said long periods of dry weather restricted barramundi habitats.\"Often if you've had a couple of years of dry spell, there hasn't been the opportunity for the interconnection of waterholes and lagoons which may house barramundi,\" he said.Big wet in the west Commercial barramundi fisherman Mark Douglas, who is based out of Wyndham in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, said his fishing grounds had experienced , which would make for a great 2017 on the water.\"We've had some significant rain over the last two months which is breaking records all around the Kimberley, so it's looking like being a good season,\" he said.\"The last few years have been a bit of a drought on land, which is a drought at sea, so I'm expecting a cracker season.\"Mr Douglas said orders from customers were flooding in and he was keen to get out on the water as soon as possible.\"I haven't seen so many prawns in the waterways like this for at least five years,\" he said.\"Prawns usually equals plenty of fish, and there's salmon everywhere at the moment, so everyone should be getting into it.\"Restocking waterways on east coast to increase catchOn the eastern seaboard, commercial and recreational fisherman have taken to restocking their waterways with barramundi fingerlings to increase their catch.Terry McGeachin, from the Townsville Barramundi Stocking Society, said the society relied on a great deal of help from commercial fishing businesses and the local council.\"I think they see the benefit in doing it. It's a fishery, it keeps local industry going and I think the place needs all we can get,\" Mr McGeachin said.The restocking program also received a boost from a group of commercial net fisherman and seafood retailers who donated $1,500 to the society to put into barramundi fingerlings.Commercial fisherman Nathan Rynn said the money had been donated to take some pressure off Mother Nature to spawn new barramundi fingerlings.\"We've had four consecutive dry years up here. This is just going to take a bit of pressure off Mother Nature in producing barramundi for us,\" Mr Rynn said.He said it was important that commercial and recreational fishermen gave back to the barramundi stocks.\"It does show a lot of unity among all sectors and uses a resource here in Townsville which important,\" he said.\"We all take from the resource so it's important, especially from a commercial point of view, that we put fish back into the water.\"Best catches could take timeProfessor Jerry said barramundi catches normally peaked about two years after a big wet season.\"Basically because it takes about that amount of time for the barramundi to become legal size to catch both commercially and recreational,\" he said.However, he said there could be some handy catches for fishermen early in the season this year.\"A big wet opens up and interconnects those habitats and allows those barramundi which may be a couple of years in age to move down into the main river systems,\" he said. - ABC", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T21:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T06:15:53.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
