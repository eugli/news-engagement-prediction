The late Friday quake roused residents from sleep in Surigao del Norte province, sending hundreds to flee their homes. AP MANILA, Philippines — President Rodrigo Duterte has visited Surigao City on Sunday afternoon to personally check on the affected residents and oversee the rescue operations. In his speech, Duterte said that the city was lucky the magnitude 6.7 earthquake was not as strong as in other places. He said it could have been worse if it reached magnitude 7. He also mentioned other topics in his speech including corruption, closure of mining companies and the Communist Party of the Philippines. Homepage   The magnitude 6.7 quake hit Surigao City on Friday night killing at least six individuals and leaving over 100 people injured.
