Remy Ma suggested that Nicki Minaj and Trey Songz had hooked up in the line \"Only time up touch a trigga's when you fuck Trey Songz .\"2. Following the line, Twitter users unearthed some old tweets from Meek Mill which seemed to confirm the rumor, though the 2015 tweets also found Trey denying it all as an \"urban legend.\" @MeekMill 😳 Urban Legend...I'ma just presume that autocorrect put the S at the end of Songz tho. My nigga Meek wouldn't do that. — Trey Songz (@TreySongz) January 30, 2015 \n3. Trey caught wind of the retweets and made a vague comment about getting pulled into drama. Even when you stay out of the way they will have ya name all in some shit. Wake up to new comedy everyday. Focus. — Trey Songz (@TreySongz) February 25, 2017 Bruh I ain't even heard this shit yet lmao. I open my twitter and see old ass retweets from 2015 🤷🏾‍♂️ https://t.co/oBOrLcwXu1 — Trey Songz (@TreySongz) February 25, 2017 Listen the internet aka mass general public is so stupid. I learn that more and more everyday hah I'm in Charlotte tonight fwm — Trey Songz (@TreySongz) February 25, 2017 \n4. Nicki called Trey out for not getting out in front of the claim and denying that he and Nicki had ever hooked up. She also brought up the hits she feels she's earned him through their collaborations. The tweets were later deleted. Yikes. Nicki had two responses for Trey but none for Remy :/And deleted them with the swiftness. pic.twitter.com/Z9rh9AQnYR — Lauren Chanel Allen (@MichelleHux) February 25, 2017 \n5. Trey responded to Nicki suggesting that he had already cleared up the rumors on his Instagram and that Nicki was simply \"mad\" following the Remy diss. He made sure to make it clear that he still has love for Minaj and made an offer for her to hop on a new track. @NICKIMINAJ you need to be mad at Remy Nicki. 😞 — Trey Songz (@TreySongz) February 25, 2017 @NICKIMINAJ cause if you check my Instagram feed I already denied it on video so words didn't get misconstrued. — Trey Songz (@TreySongz) February 25, 2017 @NICKIMINAJ I didn't post anything indirect. I gathered a understanding of events and then spoke my piece. You just mad. I still love you — Trey Songz (@TreySongz) February 25, 2017 @NICKIMINAJ I love you! https://t.co/f7fiPjg0Cy new music every Thurs 9pm - Tremaine The Album - 3.24.17 - get me some more plaques babe — Trey Songz (@TreySongz) February 25, 2017 \nAnd that's that, as for Remy's claim that Nicki cheated on her \"man\" with Ebro Darden of Hot 97, we may not get any answers until Monday's Morning show.
