No charges have been filed. The two officers involved have been reassigned to desk duty per Amtrak policy, spokesman Marc Magliari said.\n“Amtrak is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Chad Robertson,” Magliari said. “Amtrak is cooperating fully with the Chicago Police Department and State’s Attorney’s office as they conduct an independent investigation.”\nDuring an hourlong layover on a Megabus trip from Memphis to Robertson’s hometown of Minneapolis, the officers were “aggressive” when they walked up to him and two other riders inside Union Station, before following them as they walked outside to a restaurant, the suit says.\nThe officers stopped them again and started searching them, the suit says. Robertson “feared for his life” and started running.\nPolice cordon off streets near Union Station after a shooting on Feb. 8. | Sam Charles/Sun-Times\nOne officer who has not been identified “calmly dropped to one knee, removed his gloves, unsecured his weapon” and fired a shot from about 30 feet away that missed, according to the suit, which says the second shot hit Robertson in the back. He was taken to Stroger Hospital in critical condition.\nThe officer gave no commands but “calmly stated, ‘It’s a gun out. It’s a gun out,'” the suit says.\nChicago Police said Robertson was shot in the shoulder and that he was carrying cash and drugs. His attorney said he had “an insignificant” amount of marijuana, and that the father of two has no criminal record.\nDoctors weren’t able to remove the bullet from Robertson’s spine, who was left quadriplegic in his final days, the suit says.\n“When he found out about his condition from the doctors, he was heartbroken,” his sister, Nina Robertson, said at a press conference last week . “He just said, ‘The police ruined my life.’”\nMagliari said Amtrak would review the suit but declined to comment Wednesday night. Chicago Police had no updates on the investigation.\nRobertson’s family said his two companions who witnessed the shooting were set to appear before a grand jury last week. Representatives for the Cook County state’s attorney’s office declined to comment.\nAn autopsy on Robertson was scheduled for Thursday.\nThe nine-count civil rights suit claims the officers used excessive force and searched Robertson illegally.
