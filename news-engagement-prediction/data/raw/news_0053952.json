He was acquitted on the rape charge. \nRangitonga went on to abduct an intoxicated woman for sex from a Mt Maunganui Burger King drive-thru and was jailed for four years in 2014. \nThe decision to drop the original wounding charge outraged some police. In an internal memo, officer in charge Detective Sergeant Darryl Brazier wrote: \"I believe it was clearly the wrong decision by the Crown ... This has resulted in a violent [offender] walking free from the court.\" \nFor Trainor, the outcome was devastating. She drank heavily and had frequent brushes with the law, finally being jailed for six months in 2011 for an assault on her mother. \nAfter her release she got her life back on track, focused on her four children, and began investigating ways of getting justice. \nShe wrote to the solicitor-general, asking that a new wounding charge be laid against Rangitonga. \nDeputy solicitor-general Brendan Horsley wrote back saying although technically possible, \"it would be entirely inappropriate to relay a charge that the prosecutor had told Mr Rangitonga would not be proceeded with\". \nHe said although Rangitonga had admitted in court to losing his temper, slamming Trainor against a tree and \"smacking you over\", a fresh prosecution would have little chance of being successful as Rangitonga could use a number of legal avenues to have the charge dismissed. \nTrainor made contact with Shannon Parker, president of the New Zealand Police Conduct Association, which helps people with complaints against police. \nThe two began working on a private prosecution. \n\"I'm at a loss to understand why the Crown withdrew the charge in the first place when there was so much evidence. I cannot understand why the police didn't relay the charge after the offender made an admission in 2012,\" Parker said. \nIn 2014, a judge ruled that a charge of injuring with intent could be accepted by the court and a summons was issued to Rangitonga. \nTrainor, who had automatic name suppression lifted so she could talk publicly about the case, said she could hardly believe it. \n\"I've felt extremely saddened by it over the years and those feelings just would not leave me alone. It was never over for me. \n\"Maybe the worst thing that's happened to me in my life has led to one of the best things, because this is really empowering.\" \nShe paid tribute to Parker and the police officers who supported her, especially Brazier, as well as the lawyers who worked on the case, Paul Davison, QC, Marc Corlett QC and Craig Tuck. \nRangitonga has been remanded for sentencing. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T11:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:43:21.214+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
