This bodes well for LG who has had difficulty with success on their previous flagship from 2016, the LG G5, which sought to do something different by introducing a modular component to the makeup of the phone with the “Friends” attachments that were announced alongside the phone at last year’s Mobile World Congress event. \nValeur hails the LG G6 as “an ideal fusion fusion of beautiful shape and clever solution” while also stating that it provides a great user experience. While all of these are opinions of one individual and others may very well feel differently, it seems clear that LG has gone above and beyond to ensure that a majority of consumers are happy with not just the outward-facing design of their 2017 flagship, but also the inward-facing design that shines through the user interface thanks to LG’s UX 6.0 software that will be layered on top of Android 7.0 Nougat. On a more specific level, Valeur is noted as having highlighted some of his key favorite elements about the phone, pointing out that the FullVision display helps keep people focused on what’s in front of them while saying that “the eye is naturally drawn to it.” Valeur believes that LG’s design choices here have provided users with a phone that carries a screen with unnecessary distractions, which leaves them with more time to enjoy the device that they’re using. In addition, he states that great industrial design takes the user into consideration alongside the visual appeal, something which many people will no doubt agree that LG has achieved with the G6 once they’re able to see it and get their hands on it. \nLG is slated to announce the G6 at their official press conference during Mobile World Congress, dubbed LG G6 Day, which takes place on February 26th. While there are certainly some unknown factors of the device, much of what is to be expected has already leaked out and this includes the design of the phone itself as well as many of its features. Leading up to the press conference LG has even been teasing specific traits of the device recently, like the phone having a waterproof and dust proof build.
