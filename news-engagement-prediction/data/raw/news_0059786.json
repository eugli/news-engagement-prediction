(Rawpixel Ltd/Getty Images/iStockphoto)  45 PM \nWe don’t win anymore. \nLife expectancy in 35 industrialized countries is projected to increase across the board for people born in 2030, according to new research released Tuesday — but the United States’ paltry growth in longevity puts it on the same level as Mexico and the Czech Republic. \nWomen in South Korea and men in Hungary were expected to see the largest gains in life expectancy for those born from 2010 to 2030, said the study, which was funded by the EPA and UK Medical Research Council and published in The Lancet . \nThe researchers expect the spike in life expectancy to be highest in South Korea — where women are projected to live to a record 90.8 years — and lowest in the U.S., Sweden, Greece, Japan, Serbia and Macedonia. \n“Notable among poor-performing countries is the USA, whose life expectancy at birth is already lower than most other high-income countries, and is projected to fall further behind such that its 2030 life expectancy at birth might be similar to the Czech Republic for men, and Croatia and Mexico for women,” the authors write. \nAmong high-income countries, the U.S. boasts the highest BMI, homicide rate, and child and maternal mortality rates, the authors noted — not to mention it was “the first of high-income countries to experience a halt or possibly reversal of increase in height in adulthood, which is associated with higher longevity.” \nThe Land of the Free is also the sole nation in the intergovernmental Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development not to offer universal health care, the study said. \n“Not only does the USA have high and rising health inequalities, but also life expectancy has stagnated or even declined in some population subgroups,\" the authors added. \nDon’t get tired of winning yet, dear Americans.
