This is evident in what we find remaining in early Mesopotamian, home to some of the first creators of perfume. Throughout the ancient world, evidence of perfume and its vessels are found as part of burials, from ancient Egypt, to the Fertile Crescent, to Palestine. In many cases, certain compounds did double duty as both a fragrant ‘mask’ for the scent of the deceased, and to help preserve the body. Egyptian carving of a figure smelling a water lotus, an image always associated with perfume and scent. \nThe Egyptians, in particular, were adept at creating vessels out of wood and clay to hold resins, plant material, and embalming ingredients. Others were made of carved alabaster, a stone that is naturally cool to the touch, and so helped to preserve their inner materials. These vessels often took the form of animals such as ducks, cats, or rams - common animals that also embodied special spirit forms. What the Eastern ancients knew was that these perfuming materials required protection from light, temperature, and oxidation. Their preservation methods up to this point worked fairly well, although it was labor intensive to carve stone to create jars. \nStill, the world was waiting for the invention of glass to create the perfect solution for holding perfume. The discovery of glass is still up to some debate: There are records from Pliny who says the Phoenicians inadvertently invented glass by observing the shining substances left over from their campfires, where some silica had combined with the right chemicals and had begun to form glass under extended heat. Etruscan perfume vessel, in the shape of a European Roe Deer \nIt wasn’t actually discovered as a component of its own until the Egyptians began using it around the late Bronze Age (approximately 1500 BCE.) At that point, it was strictly utilized for clay glazes, for making small objects like beads, and for other protective coatings on tiles. It was some time later in this period that glass emerged as objects in their own right, when the technology had widened and creators had learned how to rope threads of glass around poles and smooth them out into what would then become small vessels. \n\"Ancient glass vessels are very unlike glass as we know it now. They were opaque, full of seeds of undissolved sand and full of bubbles trapped in the melting process. Nevertheless, Man was on the path to developing what was to be a common part of even our daily lives.” \n- W. Joe Wheeler of the American Scientific Glassblowers Society, “History of Glassblowing, Who was First?” \nIn the first and second centuries CE, glass formation continued to develop but remained a product only affordable for the very wealthy. Glass blowing as a particular technique was invented in the first century CE in the Eastern Roman Empire. It was these first Roman glass bottles that are the precursors to today’s modern perfume bottles. Small, personal-sized bottles that were blown into mold shapes were becoming more common for people to use to carry scent with them. But the more common use of glass and glass objects spread steadily into the third century, when it was used for wine bottles and holders for common liquid concoctions. It can be inferred that with the spread of glass blowing as a more common manufacturing technology, perfume was easier to transport as well, and can explain the further distribution of fragrance, as balm, incense, and oil, over the Eastern world and the rest of Europe. The knowledge of glass making increased continuously, moving world cultures closer and closer to that now well-known idea of the modern perfume bottle. 3rd-century unguentarium (oil and perfume container) Roman glass, 4.5 inches tall, found in what is today’s Israel \nThe Greeks lent a particular flair for glasswork that is unmatched to this day. Some glass bottles, amulets, trinkets, and drinking goblets were produced with blowing techniques that are non-reproducible today, much to the chagrin of modern glassblowers who would like to unlock those secrets. Advancements in glasswork arrived simultaneously to greater competition for these markets, along with a sharp decrease in the price of glass. Soon, silver, gold, and cobalt were being added to glass to bring out deep and fiery color. Explorations in material to enhance the strength, resilience, and clarity of glass (and decrease its brittleness) made the competition even stronger. The center of glass innovation moved to Venice in the Fourth Century. There are tales that the secrets of Venetian glass were so vital and precious that glass makers were kept as virtual prisoners in the island city so as not to spread their knowledge outside. Bohemian glass, 19th Century \nBut technology has a way of distributing itself around the globe, and it wasn’t long before the glass of Murano was now leader of the world, followed by places such as Bohemia, Medieval France (known for its spectacular cathedral windows.) As Europeans moved to the so-called New World on the other side of the Atlantic, they found themselves in an environment with sand of excellent quality for use in glass making. Production became an important part of the economy of the US, particularly with the invention of the pressed mold, through which glass could easily be reproduced into many like-sized shapes. It was a new take on the Roman blown-mold idea, used many centuries before. Soon entire forests were depleted in the effort to keep the glass manufacturers operating, which meant having to move sites often to meet the demand for timber. French glass blowers late 19th Century \nThe Industrial Revolution had an enormous impact on the evolution of modern perfume and its bottles. French perfumery had established itself as the center of the art, and the perfume houses responded to a dual need: High-end perfumes for the wealthy, and everyday perfumes for everyone else. This also meant that glass was being produced at a higher output than ever before, and glass factories, already busy in the bottling of wine and liquor, grew to encompass the ever growing fragrance industry. Lalique Epines bottle, 1920’s \nSome glassmakers were intent on finding ways to mass produce affordable glass bottles that could carry these scents easily and attractively, while other glassmakers like France’s Lalique sought to make the most unusual and unique of glass and crystal vessels to hold scents. This model, though having tilted more to the side of mass production, has more or less remained intact til today. \nIt was in the Nineteenth Century that a cultural shift also changed the place of the perfume bottle in everyday use. Up to a certain point, perfumes were held in containers created for them often as part of toiletries sets, but designed by glass houses, not for perfume houses. Perfumers realized the marketing potential of making the glass as much a part of the “sell” as the scent, and soon a bottle’s shape, dimensions, color and character became part of the perfume’s whole personality. Companies like L. T. Piver saw this opportunity and created some of the most remarkable bottles and packaging of the late 19th - early 20th centuries. L.T. Piver bottle for Le Trèfle Incarnat \nIt was this shift in approach that brought about the creativity of the modern perfume bottle as we know it today. Still, as that occurred, different trends emerged. Some perfumers brought new fragrances to market in distinct bottles, where the bottle was part of the design of the scent and its identity. Others streamlined their products to show a uniformity of creative vision; a sense of comfort through repetition. Good examples of this contrast in approach range from the broad glass bottle catalog of Guerlain , to the sleek, regimented proportions of Chanel . \nIt is fascinating to think that in the 2000 plus years that glass has been actively used as a material to hold perfume, no superior material has surfaced to replace its durability, dependability or strength. It has remarkable endurance and we can look at an ancient perfume bottle much the same as when it was first created. This is true despite numerous trends in many directions, toward luxurious packaging, or more simple and linear designs. We are currently in a state between extremes when consumers have not quite decided if they want all their goods to be recyclable, or if they want special bottles for each new perfume they buy. Some companies, like Le Labo , are offering refill programs for their glass bottles (where they charge less for refills when the buyer returns with the original bottle.) Modern glass blowing and shaping \nWhat's as true now as it was in Medieval Europe is that perfume moves. It’s created to move from exotic regions and travel long distances. This is an enormous part of its appeal. Just as travelers on the Silk Road or Crusaders returning from the East found out, they needed vessels to contain the strange and fascinating essences they’d encountered along their journeys. Not much in that regard has changed across millennia. And glass is still functioning much the same as it has since the very beginning.
