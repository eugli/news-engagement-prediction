The win was emotion for the siblings because of the album’s connection to their late father, who died in 2013 . \n“Oh my God, I’m going to try not to make it a habit to cry every time,” Joy Huerta said on behalf of the group “We want to thank God, our fans, the Academy. This means so much to us. The name of the album ‘Un Besito Más’ is a song we wrote for our daddy who passed away.” \nAnd ahead of the live ceremony that was filled with messages of political resistance , Jesse & Joy dedicated their Grammy to Hispanics and marginalized groups in the United States. \n“We are so proud to be Mexican-American, so this goes to all the Hispanics out there in this country,” Joy Huerta said. “To every minority group, we are with you, we stand with you.” \nJesse & Joy shared a video of their speech on their Instagram, with a Spanish and English caption that read: “ This is for all the #Latinos all over the world!!!
