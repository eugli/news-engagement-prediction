'We are going to win this argument.'\nScroll down for video\nVice President Mike Pence vowed to fight a Washington state judge's block on Donald Trump's Muslim travel ban on Sunday. Pence said he would use 'all legal means' to get it overturned\nThe block was placed by judge James Robart (pictured), who deemed it unconstitutional. A Justice Dept attempt to get the block lifted will be delayed until at least Monday\nTrump 's executive order forbidding citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries - Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen, Iran and Somalia - lasted just a week before Robart knocked it down.\nThe case was brought before the Seattle-based judge after a case was filed by the states of Washington and Minnesota.\nIssuing a command to stay the order - essentially indefinitely postponing it, pending a successful appeal by the Justice Department - Robart said the president could not impose such a wide ban.\nThat was a claim that Pence told Fox News he adamantly disagreed with.\n'Under statutory law and under the Constitution, that authority belongs to the president,' he said.\nBut the 9th Circuit Appeals Court in San Francisco does not agree with the VP, and early Sunday morning it declined a request by the Justice Department to immediately overturn Robart's block.\nThe court said that the states must have an opportunity to respond to the appeal, and that the Justice Department must file a counter-response to them by Monday afternoon.\nEven then, however, the government faces a tough challenge to get the executive order restored through the course.\nFor one, the 9th Circuit of Appeals is one of the most liberal in the US, with 18 judges named by Democratic presidents, and only seven by Republicans.\nDonald Trump blasted Robart on Saturday, promising that the 'ridiculous' opinion would be overturned. However, the appeals court refused to instantly overturn it\nCalifornia Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, told Fox News Sunday that she believed the case would go all the way to the Supreme Court.\nBut even that may provide scant relief for the Trump administration, as it will need a majority vote of five to overturn Robart's block.\nThe Supreme Court is currently tied 4-4 between Democrat and Republican judges while Trump's replacement for Antonin Scalia, Neil Gorsuch, awaits confirmation hearings.\nRobart's blocking of the ban, which was a cornerstone of Donald Trump's campaign, led to the president blasting him on Twitter.\n'The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!' he tweeted.\nHe also claimed that 'Bad people are very happy' about Robart's decision.\nThe appeals court is asking for both sides to make statements by Monday afternoon. Even the Supreme Court may not help, however, due to a 4-4 split between Dem and GOP judges\nOn Sunday Pence swerved around saying that the U.S. is 'morally superior' to Russia when asked about it on CBS's 'Face the Nation.'\nPence said he saw no 'moral equivalency' when Trump defended Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nHost John Dickerson said that President Barack Obama was often criticized by Republicans for not projecting American exceptionalism, and that perhaps President Trump's statement comparing Russia to America was a more blatant example of anti-American exceptionalism than what Obama was called out for during his time as president.\nOn Sunday Pence swerved around saying that the U.S. is 'morally superior' to Russia when asked about it on CBS's 'Face the Nation'\nDickerson asked Pence, 'Do you think America is morally superior to Russia?'\nPence said: 'What we have in this new president is someone who is willing to engage the world, including Russia, and saying where can we find common interests that will advance the security of the American people, the peace and prosperity of the world, and he is determined to come at that in a new and renewed way.'\nDickerson made further attempts to get pence to answer the question and again asked, 'Shouldn't we be able to just say yes to that question? That America is morally superior to Russia?'\nBut he dodged answering again offering a final response without addressing Russia, 'I think it is without question, John, that American ideals are superior to countries all across the world.'\nOn Sunday Pence also defended President Trump's decision to keep an order protecting the rights of LGBT workers during an interview on This Week with ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos.\nHe said Trump made it clear during his campaign that 'discrimination would have no place in our administration'.\nStephanopoulos asked the Vice President's response of social conservatives to Trump's decision last week to keep intact President Obama's 2014 executive order barring discrimination against LGBT employees of federal contractors.\nStephanopoulos referred to the reaction of Bob Vander Plaats of the conservative group The Family Leader.\nHe said: 'Our base would want to know who is responsible for what we believe is an issue of religious liberty â€” that would be of concern to us.'\nStephanopoulos asked Pence what the answer was.\n'He was the very first Republican nominee to mention the LGBTQ community at our Republican National Convention and was applauded for it. And I was there applauding with him.\n'I think the generosity of his spirit, recognizing that in the patriot's heart, there's no room for prejudice, is part of who this president is.'", "external_links": ["http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/02/05/pence-will-use-all-legal-means-at-our-disposal-to-reinstate-immigration-ban.html", "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mike-pence-lgbt-rights-discrimination-place-trump-administration/story?id=45273812", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-05T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T04:29:22.210+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
