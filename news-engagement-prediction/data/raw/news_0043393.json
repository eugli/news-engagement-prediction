The help they sought? More prayer in schools. \nTo that end, the ministers asked the Indiana House Education Committee to support House Bill 1024, which seeks to prevent public schools from discriminating against students for their religious beliefs and how they express them. It calls for allowing students to pray aloud and engage in religious activities during school, including the creation of a \"public forum\" for religion and allowing students to wear clothing, jewelry and other accessories that bear religious messages. \n“I believe that school prayer may cause students to acknowledge a power greater than themselves, on which they can rely for comfort and help in times of trouble,\" said the Rev. David W. Greene, Sr. , president of the Concerned Clergy of Indianapolis, who testified in favor of the bill. \"This will lead to decreased reliance on drugs, alcohol, sex and dangerous amusements.\" \nAlso speaking in support of the bill was Mary Carmen Zakrajsek, a Carmel High School student whose anti-abortion group found controversy when it posted a pro-life sign in school. \"Student voices are being silenced,\" she said, \"and it's time to take a stand.\" \nHowever, it wasn't readily obvious how the bill's provisions differ from how schools already accommodate religious expression. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, students in public schools already have the right to pray individually or in groups and express their religious beliefs in their homework and artwork, where those beliefs relate to their assignment. They can read religious literature during student activities and form religious clubs. They can also wear T-shirts with religious messages. \n\"We really believe this bill is trying to recodify or in some way reaffirm things that are already in place,\" said David Sklar, government affairs director with the Jewish Community Relations Council. Sklar said the JCRC opposes the bill, which he said seems to be a solution in search of a problem. He said the burden shouldn't be placed on students — or their parents — to \"extricate\" the child from unwanted religious instruction at school. \n“We believe as a community that prayer is taught in our religious institutions,\" Sklar said. \"It is up to us as parents to make sure that our students, our children, receive that religious education as we see fit.” \nRead more: Cities' appeal denied in RFRA 'fix' case \nThe bill calls for schools to make \"reasonable accommodations\" for students who don't wish to participate in religious instruction. That could simply mean \"free time,\" according to the bill's author, Rep. John Bartlett, D-Indianapolis, but what to do with the students would be left to schools. \nBartlett said similar prayer bills have been adopted in Texas, Tennessee and Mississippi. He was inspired to bring it up in Indiana because of the problems he sees in his district, which covers the southern half of Lawrence Township and includes some high crime areas. \"You've got 12, 14-year-old kids going to school with a gun. When I was going to school, that did not happen,\" he said. Instead of believing in \"me and my gun,\" he'd prefer to see a belief in a higher power. \nBartlett, who is Christian, said he's open to students of other religions expressing their faith in schools, as well as students of no religious belief. \nThe discussion included nostalgic remembrances, from witnesses such as Rev. Wayne Moore , pastor of Olivet Missionary Baptist Church, who recalled an era when teachers led prayer in school and students spent several hours each week receiving religious instruction during school time. But Morris Klapper, an Indianapolis attorney, had more uncomfortable memories of that era. As a Jewish boy, he was forced by a teacher to bow his head for a Christian prayer, and later asked, along with other Jewish children, to get up and leave during such activities. \"It was demeaning,\" he said. \nDebate on school prayer is scheduled to continue in the education committee on Tuesday, the final day for House bills to leave committee. \nThe testimony on religious expression in school followed a more wonkish debate in the education committee on how struggling private schools are held accountable when they accept taxpayer-funded vouchers. Currently, when such schools receive D or F grades, in subsequent years they are no longer allowed to accept new students who rely on the choice scholarships, or vouchers. \nOn a party line vote, the education committee voted 8-4 to approve House Bill 1384, which allows schools that accept the vouchers to ask the state for a waiver that would enable them to continue receiving the state money as they try to raise their grade. \nCritics of the bill said it lowers the bar of accountability for schools that are supposed to be good alternatives to public schools. Supporters say it allows parents to continue to keep that school as a choice option. They also say such private schools now risk quicker closure for poor performance than traditional public schools, who can perform poorly for four years or more before they face closure. \nHB 1384 now moves to the House floor. \nCall IndyStar reporter Robert King at (317) 444-6089.
