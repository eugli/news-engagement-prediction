Our in-house film critic Sreeju Sudhakaran is watching the movie and the first half just got over. Here is what he has to say about how Bogan is so far… \nThe first question that came to my mind when I entered the theatre to watch Bogan is – will Jayam Ravi and Arvind Swamy recreate the magic of their previous venture, Thani Oruvan? I am sure even you would be also having the same doubt in your mind. And as I watched the first half of the movie, the first thought that came in my mind is – so far so good. Despite hiccups in the initial proceedings, Bogan manages to invoke enough curiosity into the premise, that we are easily anticipating the next scene as to what the lead characters will do next. Also Read: Bogan movie review, box office collection, story, trailer, music, lyrics, Hansika, Arvind, Jayam \nThe story is like this – Nearly first half of the movie is dedicated to setting up the romance between Vikram, a honest cop played by Jayam Ravi and Mahalakshmi, a bubbly girl played by Hansika Motwani . While time feels stuck as you watch their romance blossom into marital bliss, enters the saviour of the movie, Adithya, played in debonair style by Arvind Swamy. He is a playboy and a thief, and his entry scene is something that is straight out of a male fantasy. He is brilliant mastermind and he has a secret way in which he manipulates people to do his bidding. When Adithya’s father becomes one such victim, Adithya decides to bring the culprit behind the bars. But the power that Adithya holds is something that is beyond his own imagination. \nThere is no doubt that Bogan is completely Arvind Swamy’s show the moment Roja star makes his entry. Though there is a fear that he may get typecast in such roles in future, no such doubts exists as you watch his smooth performance. Jayam Ravi gets a massy entry through Damale Damale song that later transcends into an action scene, that’s deftly choreographed. Even later, he proves himself to be an able performer in the dramatic scenes. Hansika Motwani surprisingly does well in the lighter portions of the movie, and her chemistry with Jayam Ravi is terrific. However it is the cat and mouse game between Jayam Ravi and Arvind Swamy’s characters that remain the best part of the thriller. The interval reaches when Adithya gets to control Vikram. A really interesting first half. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T20:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T10:11:38.185+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
