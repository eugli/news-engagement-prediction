The interior ministry figures 3,533 attacks on migrants and asylum hostels in 2016 2.545 attacks on individual migrants 560 people injured, including 43 children 988 attacks on housing (slightly fewer than in 2015) 217 attacks on refugee organisations and volunteers \nBut the number of asylum seekers arriving in Germany in 2016 was 280,000, a drop of more than 600,000 from the previous year, following the closure of the Balkan migrant route and an EU deal with Turkey. \nThe issue is expected to feature heavily in parliamentary elections this September. Image copyright AFP Image caption The left is urging the government to focus more on attacks by far right groups \nSunday's interior ministry figures, which are preliminary, were released in response to a parliamentary question. \nThere was no comparison with previous years because the crimes only started to be counted as a separate category in 2016. \nIn its statement, the interior ministry said it strongly condemned the violence. \n\"People who have fled their home country and seek protection in Germany have the right to expect safe shelter,\" the statement read. \nSwedish asylum shelter hit by blaze \nMP Ulla Jelpke from the leftist Die Linke party said that the government was too focused on a perceived security threat from migrants while the real threat was coming from the far right. \n\"Do people have to die before the rightwing violence is considered a central domestic security problem and makes it to the top of the national policy agenda?\" she said, quoted by the Funke media group. \n\"Nazis are threatening refugees and therefore our democracy.\" \nA note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.
