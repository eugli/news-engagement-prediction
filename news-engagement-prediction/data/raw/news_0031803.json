(Photo: AP) Bijnor: Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati on Saturday said her government, if voted to power, would concentrate more on the development of Uttar Pradesh and welfare of the people rather than constructing more memorials and statues.\n\"I promise that, henceforth, no statues, memorials and museums would be constructed because these works were completed during my last tenure itself. And my government would solely focus on the welfare of the people and the development of the state,\" Mayawati said while addressing a rally in Bijnor.\nThe BSP Supremo's comment comes at an interesting juncture, as she was being called out by the Opposition for her elitist lifestyle and self-promoting demeanor, taking her agenda of serving the people completely off-track.\nMayawati further asked the voters not to 'waste' their vote on the Samajwadi Party and said that voting for the party, which is brindled with infighting, would serve no purpose and would only benefit the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\n\"In the upcoming Assembly polls, don't vote for the Samajwadi Party, as the faction within the party will try to cut each other's voter base. Hence I ask the people, especially minorities, note to vote for them. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would gain if you vote for them. Cast your vote for the BSP which is the only party that has the capacity to defeat the BJP,\" she said.\nShe also asked the voters to be wary of the assurances made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and reminded them that the promises made during the 2014 General election were not fulfilled.\n\"Among the many important promises Prime Minister Modi made during the 2014 elections, is that he promised to give 15 to 20 lakh rupees in the bank accounts of each and every poor household and also promised that loans given to farmers would be waived off. Similar promises have also been made in the assembly elections as well, these promises like the General elections, are nothing but a jumla,\" Mayawati said.\nThe former Uttar Pradesh chief minister also said, that once her party is voted to power, all the schemes which were stopped by the present dispensation in the state would resume.\nIn Uttar Pradesh, polling is underway for the first phase of Assembly Elections in 73 constituencies in 15 western districts of the state.\nOverall 52.9 percent votes were polled till 3 PM. Voting began at 7 AM and will end at 5 PM. Nearly 2 crore 60 lakh people are deciding the political fate of 839 candidates, including 77 women today.\nSecurity arrangements are in place with heavy deployment of the Central Para Military Forces with the local police and security staff maintaining strict vigil on the roads.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T02:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T02:06:07.139+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
