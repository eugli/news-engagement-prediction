Offset added: \"That's because the world is fucked up.\" Quavo also suggested that Makonnen's coming out somehow contradicts with the subject matter of his music. \"That's wack, bro,\" he said. Peep the full exchange, straight from the feature , here: \"All are wildly different MCs, illustrating the 'diversity' that Quavo says is one of the things he most loves about Atlanta. And so I'm surprised by Migos' reaction when I mention iLoveMakonnen, the local MC who just came out as gay on Twitter. 'Damn, Makonnen!' Quavo bellows after an awkward interlude. I mention support I saw online for Makonnen's decision. 'They supported him?' Quavo asks, raising an eyebrow. 'That's because the world is fucked up,' says Offset. 'This world is not right,' Takeoff says. 'We ain't saying it's nothing wrong with the gays,' says Quavo. But he suggests that Makonnen's sexuality undermines his credibility, given the fact that 'he first came out talking about trapping and selling Molly, doing all that.'\" Reps for Makonnen declined to comment. Reps for Migos did not immediately respond to Complex's request for comment.
