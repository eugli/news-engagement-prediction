Officials warn residents to use extreme caution when around any body of water. Watch California National Guard chopper crew rescue man, 81, from Plumas County flood waters Flood waters in Plumas County nearly claimed an 81-year-old man Friday afternoon. The Indian Valley resident tried to drive across Arlington Bridge near Crescent Mills despite several inches of water on the bridge surface. When his vehicle stalled he stepped out of it and was immediately swept downstream, said Plumas County Sheriff Greg Hagwood. Hagwood was 30 seconds away in an Air National Guard helicopter assessing flood damage and the need for evacuations in Indian Valley. The helicopter swooped down over Indian Creek and lowered a trained rescue officer to the man, who was clinging to a willow tree 100 yards below the bridge. Cosumnes Fire crews rescue two people stranded after flood waters sweep truck 50 feet off road The water rescue occurred near where New Hope Road crosses Grizzly Slough between the Cosumnes and Mokelumne rivers. As water began submerging the truck, the two occupants sought refuge on the top of the vehicle, said Julie Rider, a Cosumnes Fire Department spokeswoman.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T11:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T06:56:51.202+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
