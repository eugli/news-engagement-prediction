Photo: AP \nGiven references in some reports to the existence of transcripts of the Flynn-Kislyak calls, the changed explanation by Flynn can be read as him belatedly realising or, perhaps, having been informed, that the detail of his conversation is known in Washington because the US intelligence services were listening in - as, of course, they would be to a call when one of the parties is an ambassador whose country is about to be whacked with sanctions. \nPence, reportedly, is unhappy. Current administration officials are saying that, in explaining himself to the Vice-President before Pence defended him several times, Flynn had parsed the call as an exchange of pleasantries - happy Christmas and all that. \nOminously for the administration, the Post is reporting that the FBI is investigating Flynn's communications with the Russian, either as a standalone probe or as part of an ongoing, wider investigation into Russian interference in the election and/or the links between Trump's campaign and Moscow. \nAnd, while Democrats are demanding all sorts of action, including that Flynn's security pass be cancelled, Republicans are staying silent - not so much out of support for Flynn as a belief by some that Flynn always was destined to self-immolate. \nQuestions abound: \n• Can Trump afford to retain the services of a national security adviser who \"can't remember\" what he discussed with the ambassador for such a key world power? \n• Why did Flynn repeatedly deny the substance of his call to the Russian ambassador unless he knew all along that it was inappropriate - and possibly illegal? \n• How could Flynn not have stopped before picking up the phone to consider the likelihood that the call would be recorded by US intelligence? \n• If no less than nine senior and current officials were willing to hang Flynn out to the Post , what sort of loyalty and respect does he command within the administration? \n• Did Trump, as president-elect, sanction the call? \n• If Flynn was prepared to undermine the then US president on the questions of sanctions, what was the extent of his other communications with the Russian ambassador - and what was discussed? \nThe Trump-Flynn relationship was always going to intrigue, because national security is such a hot button issue for Trump and because of a contradiction at the heart of a recent considered explanation by Flynn of how security policy might be conducted. \nOn the one hand, he scoffed to The Washington Post's David Ignatius about micromanagement by previous administrations, which he likened to a \"5000-mile screwdriver\", arguing that cabinet agencies should be allowed to do their jobs. On the other hand, he referred to Trump as the chariot driver in Ben Hur , urging his horses forward. \nIn January, when Iran tested a new missile, Flynn was quickly wheeled out to warn that Tehran \"was on notice\". But on Sunday morning, Flynn was conspicuously absent from the airwaves. \nDespite steady attacks and questioning, Trump has been loyal to Flynn. But much of that was based on Flynn's performance during the campaign - as a lone security establishment figure who would deign to share a stage with Trump, even leading the \"lock her up!\" chants. Flynn had great value. \nNow that Trump is in office, Flynn might well have reached his use-by date. During the campaign Trump had no hesitation in getting rid of his campaign manager Paul Manafort when awkward questions were being asked about Manafort's Moscow connections. \nAnother reason for Trump to rethink Flynn's tenure is last week's story of Trump calling Flynn in the middle of the night to ask if the US wanted a strong or weak dollar. Trump is furious about leaks from the administration - but surely that damaging leak had to have started with Flynn telling someone about the call from the President in the middle of the night? \nIt's likely this thing has a way to go. \nThe President's weekend claim that he knew nothing of The Washington Post's bombshell report from nine sources sounded disingenuous. At the same time his undertaking to \"look into it\" ought to cause discomfort for Flynn. \nPerhaps a greater warning to Flynn was the administration's failure - perhaps, \"refusal\" is a better word - to field more talking heads for the round of Sunday morning TV talk shows. \nThe only administration official to make an appearance was senior policy adviser Stephen Miller - and just hours after the North Korean missile test, Miller refused to say if Trump still had confidence in Flynn. \n\"It's not for me to tell you what's in the President's mind,\" Miller told NBC's Meet the Press . \n\"That's a question for the President. Asked and answered.\" \nAnd asked if the White House had given him any guidance on Flynn's position, Miller said: \"They did not give me anything to say.\" \nOn ABC's This Week , Miller joshed: \"I don't have any news to make you today on this point … \" \nBut that no-news answer is news, because the White House is not taking Flynn at his word, as Pence had. \nMiller was not sent out to defend Flynn, which has to be read as hesitation by Trump and others on Flynn's reliability. \nThat they didn't give Miller a script speaks volumes. Here's an administration that is seriously sophisticated in mounting blizzard media appearances to defend itself or to change the debate. Instead, it opted to leave empty seats on the shows' panels that were taken by Democrats who tore at Flynn's credibility - leaving the image of a carcass hanging in the breeze. \nAnd in not defending Flynn, Miller's performance earned an elephant stamp from the President, who tweeted: \"Congratulations Stephen Miller on representing me this morning on the various Sunday morning shows. Great job!\" \nYup, there's blood in the water - and in these parts, sharks abound.
