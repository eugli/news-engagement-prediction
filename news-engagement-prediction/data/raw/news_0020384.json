The list was narrowed down from over 3,000 applications.\nCanadian Space Agency narrows astronaut candidates down to 72 Leuschen said his love of space came early, while growing up on a farm in Bruno, Sask.\n\"I'd climb up to the top of the granary to watch sunsets, or [go] out snowmobiling out in the dark and you'd see the entire sky almost like you were in outer space,\" said Leuschen.\nChildhood dream The idea of becoming an astronaut was cemented for Leuschen after meeting Marc Garneau at the Canada-Wide Science Fair.\n\"Canada's first astronaut came and spoke to us. I had the certainty of a 12-year-old, where I knew that's a job I wanted to do,\" said Leuschen.\nNext up for Leuschen is a round of physical and aptitude testing to determine if he'll advance to the next round of the process.\n\"I feel I like I've got a good shot at it and if nothing else, even if I don't get selected, it's going to be a lot of fun to go through the tests and get to meet the other candidates.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T21:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:37:33.141+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
