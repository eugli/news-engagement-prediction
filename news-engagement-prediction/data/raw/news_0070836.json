Reputable antivirus and protection tools enclose a built-in definition updater to make sure users get the latest signatures, provided their PC is connected to the Internet. However, even if an Internet connection is not available, having the signature database updated is a must. Specifically designed for such situations, Norton AntiVirus Virus Definitions deploys a package containing the latest virus signatures issued by Symantec, which can be manually installed for various security products. These virus definitions are applicable to all Symantec security software utilities, such as Nortin Security, Security with Backup, AntiVirus / Internet Security, 360, Endpoint Protection, Protection Engine, Mail Security for Domino, and Mail Security for Microsoft Exchange. You just have to make sure you get the right package for your system's architecture (32 or 64-bit) and Symantec product version (see the Features section for more info about the External mirrors ). The Symantec Intelligent Updater requires no user feedback, as you just have to launch it and wait for the definitions to be installed. Any available Symantec program is automatically recognized and a log file is created to store information about the definition update. Advanced users can type the name of the installer in the command line, alongside '/?' to get specific options for different Symantec programs, which enables them to avoid deploying all the updates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T16:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T12:29:41.367+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
