REUTERS/Aziz Taher \nBEIRUT Marine Le Pen, presidential candidate for France's far-right National Front party, cancelled a meeting on Tuesday with Lebanon's Grand Mufti after refusing to wear a headscarf for the encounter. \n\"You can pass on my respects to the Grand Mufti, but I will not cover myself up,\" Le Pen told reporters. \nThe press office for the Grand Mufti said that Le Pen's aides had been informed beforehand of their requirement for her to wear head covering for the meeting. \nLe Pen has been visiting Lebanon as she seeks to bolster her presidential credentials. \nOpinion polls say Le Pen is likely to get the highest score in the first round of voting in April, but then lose to a mainstream candidate in the decisive second round vote in May. \n(Reporting by Simon Carraud and Angus McDowall; Writing by Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by John Irish) Next In World News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T15:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T10:56:37.075+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
