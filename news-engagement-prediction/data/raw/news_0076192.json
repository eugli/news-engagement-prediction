Maricopa County Superior Court \nDelia Mary Flores (Photo: Maricopa County Sheriff's Office) \n24 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 4 COMMENT EMAIL MORE A Scottsdale woman accused of shooting her boyfriend in the genitals told police she thought he was having an affair, officials say.\nDelia Mary Flores, 53, is suspected of shooting her boyfriend seven times with a .32-caliber revolver, firing one shot into his penis and two shots into his scrotum, police said in court documents.\nThe man, whose name was not released, was expected to survive his injuries.\nHe told officers that he had been sleeping upright in a chair around 8:30 p.m. Saturday when he woke up to what he thought were fireworks until he felt \"excruciating pain in his lower extremities.\"\nFlores made the 911 call and told the dispatcher she didn't know how her boyfriend had been shot, only that he asked her to get help, police said.\nPolice said Flores met officers outside as they arrived to the home she shares with her boyfriend in the 7400 block of East Parkview Lane. At first, Flores said she didn't know what happened, but she then \"quickly changed her answer without prompting and told officers that she had shot her boyfriend after learning that he had been having an affair,\" police said in court records.\nThe couple had been dating for two years, and she moved in with him last year.\nIn an interview with the patient at HonorHealth Scottsdale Osborn Medical Center, the man told police he wasn't having an affair and didn't know why she would have shot him. He didn't think Flores even knew how to use a gun, police said.\nA revolver was found beneath the chair he had been sleeping in when he was shot. Among Flores' clothes was a .32-caliber handgun box in a Victoria's Secret bag, along with a receipt that showed the gun had been purchased 10 days before the shooting, according to police.\n\"The fact that there were gunshots directed at the victim's neck near his head, and that the victim was sleeping at the time of the shooting and no argument was taking place, it is believed that the defendant intentionally planned to shoot the victim with premeditation,\" police concluded in court documents.\nFlores was being held Monday in a Maricopa County jail and is facing charges of attempted first-degree murder and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. A judge set her bond at $750,000.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T03:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:07:34.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
