As well as concerns about the overall picture, there have been worries that a new formula for allocating cash has still left some schools without adequate budgets. \nA number of Conservative backbenchers have called for a rethink on the funding plans.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:27:38.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
