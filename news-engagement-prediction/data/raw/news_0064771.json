That was also because it did not have the product variety it has now. It was also setting up manufacturing facilities. \nThe company is planning to start manufacturing refrigerators in 2018. “We will also spend 10% of our revenue on promoters, advertising and consumer finance,” said Sharma. Panasonic’s consumer business is worth Rs 4,500 crore.

Soap to shampoo and cement to automobiles, the cash crunch is punching red marks on their balance sheets, even as they continue to put on a brave face on hopes for “long-term gains from this short-term pain”. \nAn analysis of the latest quarter results of listed firms shows that the government’s ambitious exercise of withdrawing old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes led to adverse impact on businesses across the sectors, though not many have publicly criticised the move and the likes of Rajiv Bajaj are only an exception. \nThough most of the companies said that the note-ban has caused short-term financial impact -- it is a ‘new normal’ for businesses. Large corporations and their owners agreed. \n“Pace of domestic demand growth slowed down due to demonetisation of old currency notes during the quarter. However, demand is expected to revive as the effects of demonetisation are absorbed and the economy readjusts to the new normal,” said Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries (RIL) in a statement, according to agencies. \nIn an investor presentation, Aditya Birla Group’s UltraTech described the note ban as “short-term pain and long-term gain” and listed a number of short-term adverse impact such as “acute liquidity crunch”, reduction in purchase volumes as also impact on GDP and currency rates. \nTata Group firm Titan Company, in a quarterly update for third fiscal quarter, said all its consumer-facing businesses witnessed a “drastic slowdown for a few days”. \n( With inputs from PTI ) ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T00:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:13:15.936+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
