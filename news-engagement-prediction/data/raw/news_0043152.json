They are telling stories that are not only diverse, they are tackling serious issues . We've got books coming out this year that delve into race, gender, sexuality, immigration and way more, all unflinchingly honest and raw in their depictions. Another crucial topic authors are delving into? Mental health . \nThere has been a stigma around mental health for as long as it has been acknowledged. Not only have people with mental health conditions often been told just to \"Cheer up!\" as if they can control their anxiety or depression, many have viewed mental health as something other; dangerous or scary. Now more than ever, it is crucial for us to understand the daily struggles of those who deal with mental health conditions, so that we can demand the proper health care coverage for everyone who needs medication or therapy or some other treatment for their condition... regardless of their job status or salary. \nIf 2017 is the year of resistance, it's also the year of learning. Now is the time to put ourselves in others' shoes, walk around in them a little, and learn to understand experiences that are different from our own. These nine books all grapple with some form of mental health, from anxiety to OCD to trauma. 1 'History Is All You Left Me' by Adam Silvera \nAdam Silvera's sophomore release follows Griffin, a teen who is not only dealing with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, but who is also going through the trauma of losing his best friend and former boyfriend, Theo, in a drowning accident.

To add to her troubles, her mom — the only one who really gets what Maeve goes through — is leaving for six months, so Maeve will be sent to live with her dad in Vancouver, which brings a slew of new fears. But Maeve finds brief moments of calm (as well as even more worries) with Salix, a local girl who doesn’t seem to worry about anything. Between her dad’s wavering sobriety, dealing with her pregnant stepmom, and her bumbling courtship with Salix, this summer brings more catastrophes than even Maeve could have foreseen. \nClick here to buy. 5 'Goodbye Days' by Jeff Zentner (March 7, 2017) \nJeff Zentner's Goodbye Days deals with anxiety and trauma following Carver Briggs, who was behind the wheel of the car when it fatally crashed, killing his three best friends, Mars, Eli, and Blake.
