What’s big about 10,000? \n“Turns out in 1960 in Japan they figured out that the average Japanese man, when he walked 10,000 steps a day, burned something like 3,000 calories and that is what they thought the average person should consume. So they picked 10,000 steps as a number.” \nHe argues following arbitrary goals could have a negative effect overall. \n“Imagine everyone thinks they have to do 10,000 steps but if you are not actually physically capable of doing that, you could actually cause harm or damage by doing so.” \nIt’s not the first time fitness apps have been called into question. \nA study last year found tracking your steps doesn’t actually improving your chances of losing weight. \nBut Dr Hager insists step-counters are indicative of a wider problem. \n“You’d like to believe that many of these apps have a science base that relates to them,” he explains. \n“But in many cases it’s not clear what the relationship is between what we know in terms of scientific evidence and what’s actually built into these apps.” \nFind us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat Share This:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:15:09.298+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
