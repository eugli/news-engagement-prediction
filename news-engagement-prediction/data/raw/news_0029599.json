That's why many lovers chose to spend their sweet time in hotels instead of going traveling,\" said Chen Xiaotian, director of business development of the accommodation business at Ctrip. \nHe added the room price decrease after the Lantern Festival led to the surge in reservations for Valentine's Day. \nIn addition, this year's Valentine's Day saw an increase in the number of parents choosing to take their children traveling, as young children are still on their winter vacation. \nWarm and coastal cities are popular destinations. Coastal cities such as Sanya and Haikou in Hainan province, in addition to Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Kunming and Hangzhou, have welcomed a greater number of tourists. \nFor outbound tourism, Southeast Asian locations such as Bangkok, Singapore and Phuket were favorite destinations for lovers. \nCheng Yu contributed to this story. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T20:33:35.951+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
