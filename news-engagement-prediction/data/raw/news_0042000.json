But why is 10,000 steps important? What’s big about 10,000?” he said, according to Sky News. \n“Turns out in 1960 in Japan they figured out that the average Japanese man, when he walked 10,000 steps a day, burned something like 3,000 calories and that is what they thought the average person should consume. So they picked 10,000 steps as a number.” \nDr Hager went on to condemn the one-size-fits-all fitness plans some apps promote, saying following the apps could “amplify issues” for some users. \nFor example, he pointed out that not everyone will be capable of completing 10,000 steps per day if they have an underlying health issue, but the apps won’t necessarily address this. In addition, we may be failing to complete exercises relevant to our personal needs while fixating on the 10,000 steps. \n“I think apps could definitely be doing more harm than good. I am sure that these apps are causing problems. Without any scientific evidence base, how do you know that any of these apps are good for you? They may even be harmful,” he said. \nDr Hager is not the first to question the benefits of fitness trackers.
