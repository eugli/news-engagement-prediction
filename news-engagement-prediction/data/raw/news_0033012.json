Video by Chris Solari/DFP Michigan State head coach Tom Izzo questions a call with official Pat Driscoll during the second half of MSU's 74-66 win Tuesday at Breslin Center. (Photo: Mike Carter USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nEAST LANSING – Tom Izzo’s hatred of Twitter is about as well-known as his raspy voice. \nMichigan State’s coach, who famously does not use social media, used the first few minutes of his interview with reporters following the Spartans’ 74-66 win over Ohio State to fire back at disparaging comments from the past few weeks from one tweeter in particular. \nDan Dakich. \nDakich was Public Enemy No. 1 at Breslin Center on Tuesday night after comments and replies he made about and to MSU fans on Twitter following the Spartans’ 86-57 blowout loss at Michigan a week earlier. Dakich broadcast that game as well for ESPN, and his son, Andrew, is a senior basketball player for the Wolverines who is redshirting this season. \n“Danny owes our fans and our students an apology,” Izzo said of the ESPN analyst, who broadcast MSU’s game for the second straight week. “I probably won’t get it. I always got along with Dan. But as you know, it seems like this year, a lot of people have been mad at me. But I would have loved to get in that Izzone and join those chants. If I was on Twitter – thank God I’m not, thank God some of my friends are.” CLOSE x Share Lansing State Journal sports columnist Graham Couch and Detroit Free Press / LSJ MSU beat writer Chris Solari break down the Spartans' 74-66 win over Ohio State Tuesday night at Breslin Center. Graham Couch / Lansing State Journal \nSome of the tweets sent by the elder Dakich, a former player and coach at Indiana, called MSU fans whiners. One said “MSU always worried about UM.” Another accused a Twitter user of only going to MSU because he did not get into Michigan. And many others. \nDakich and play-by-play announcer Dan Shulman returned to East Lansing on Tuesday, and the Izzone repeatedly unleashed venomous chants of “We hate Dakich” throughout the broadcast, specifically during time-outs and Ohio State free throws. \nIzzo communicates often with the Izzone about sportsmanship and things that are said that he does not like. He said the chants were bothering him during the game. \nESPN broadcaster Dan Dakich (Photo: Julian H. Gonzalez DFP) \nAt first. \n“Until I got in the locker room. I asked, ‘What was that all about?’ And somebody read me his tweets,” Izzo said, dragging out the next three words: “The SOCIAL media.” \nAnd then, Izzo really went into attack mode. \n“If I would have known that before the game, I would have embarrassed myself almost as much as he embarrassed himself, and I would have led the chants,” Izzo said, his voice slightly cracking. “Because calling us whiners and that is kind of unprofessional. Classy broadcasters, like George Blaha and everybody else, wouldn’t have even thought to do something like that on TV. But saying our students couldn’t get in there? And he’s doing games for Michigan when his son is there? That is a disappointment, and that is ridiculous. Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
