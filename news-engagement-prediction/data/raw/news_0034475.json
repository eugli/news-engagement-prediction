He does not face any immediate suspension. PCB's ACU has also questioned Shahzaib Hasan and Zulfiqar Babar.\" \n\nIrfan, at 7f 1in (2m16) the tallest international cricketer ever, has played four Tests, 60 one-day internationals and 20 Twenty20 matches since making his debut in 2010. \n\nHe was part of Pakistan's one-day squad on last month's tour of Australia but returned home after the death of his mother. \n\nPSL chairman Najam Sethi said the probe will continue. \n\n\"All three players will continue to play while the ACU will remain vigilant and continue to protect the PSL from the menace of corruption,\" said Sethi. \n\nIslamabad United left out Irfan from their team for their match against Lahore Qalandars on Saturday which they lost by six wickets. \n\n\"Emotionally and physically, the team has been through hell, to be honest. It is not the greatest preparation coming in to a match,\" Islamabad coach and former Aussie great Dean Jones told The National newspaper. \n\n\"Coming here, the boys wanted to get out and have some fun. Unfortunately, it hasn't worked that way. \n\n\"But now we will get together and just move on. And well done to the PCB. I think they have handled everything over the past 24 hours very well. \n\n\"We are here to keep this great game clean, and we will do everything we can to help out the ICC and PCB in everything they do.\" \n\nHasan, who featured in Pakistan's World Twenty20 winning team in 2009, plays for Karachi Kings while Babar represents Quetta Gladiators. \n\nBabar has played 15 Tests, five one-day and seven Twenty20 internationals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T17:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T07:00:02.929+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
