They were about to take off from Reykjavik in Iceland when he was removed from the plane.\nBritish Muslim teacher denied entry to US on school trip Read more\nMiah, who had valid visa documentation, was escorted from the plane by security personnel. “Everyone was looking at me,” Miah said. “As I was getting my luggage the teachers and kids were confused. I couldn’t believe this was happening. I was being escorted out. It made me feel like a criminal. I couldn’t speak, I was lost for words.”\nThis comes after a US appeals court upheld a decision to suspend Donald Trump’s executive order. Trump had tried to impose a temporary ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries entering the US.\nThe school trip went ahead as planned, but without Miah, who flew back to the UK.\nShare your experiences Have you had similar problems entering the US since the travel ban was announced?
