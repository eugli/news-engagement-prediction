For the 70 guestsÂ and staff stranded at the Esalen Institute, aÂ self-help retreat center for one-percenters Â (and those who are will to shell out hundreds of dollars to hole upÂ in a sleeping bag onsite), The Esalen Institute, being rained in could be worse. \nOn February 21, The Guardian reported that Big Sur's wettest season on record decimated the Esalen Institute's road access. Those holed up inside will likely be evacuated via helicopter next week, after the rain eases up. In the meantime, the five dozen entrepreneurs, artists, and spiritual healers who remain are taking advantage of whatÂ the retreat center has to offer. \nThose awaiting evacuation enjoy ratatouille, Thai curry soup, quinoa, and vegetables plucked from the garden and prepared in the center's newly renovated dining hall . A supply of rice, beans, and kale will sustain them when their other food stores dry up. \nWorkshops have been put on hold since February 12, butÂ employees are still being paid, Gordon Wheeler, Esalen's president and CEO, told The Guardian. A post shared by Veronika Vogler (@mooodenkind) on Jan 3, 2017 at 3:38pm PSTÂ on Jan 3, 2017 at 3:38pm PST \nThe Esalen, founded in 1962 by two former Stanford students, offers 600 workshops and programs a year devoted to \"cultivating deep change in self and society,\" according to the website . It has served as a haven for artists and philosophical types since its founding. Today, approximately 17,000 visitors come every yearÂ to unplug and \"re-energize a sense of purpose.\" \nOver the years, the Esalen has attracted major influencers, including American psychologists Carl Rogers and B.F. Skinner, wellness guru Deepak Chopra, and photographer Ansel Adams. The center even got a nod in the series finale of AMC's \"Mad Men,\" when Don Draper escaped across the country to an eerily similar coastal commune, in search of himself.

Chip Conley, who left his roleÂ as head of global hospitality at AirbnbÂ in January, leads programming Â forÂ CEOs andÂ founders on-site. \nWeekend programs start at $405 for sleeping-bagÂ accommodations and $790 for standard rooms; seven-day programs start at $900 and $ 1,700 , respectively. \nWorkshopsÂ may resume as early as March 3, according to a post on the groups' Facebook page.
