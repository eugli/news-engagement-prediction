(Photo: Benjamin Sakwa/Standard) \nOne of the soldiers killed in a terrorist attack on a Kenyan military camp in Somalia had told his wife, a day to the attack, that he was contemplating quitting. \n\"Life is hard in Somalia. We don't know when the enemy will strike. When my contract expires I will quit KDF,\" were the last words Victor Shipiti told his wife Purity Kendi. \nHe was among KDF officers killed during the Al Shabaab attack on Kulbiyow military camp. \nMr Shipiti, 33, had defied a request by his father, James Iravonga, to resign from the military last year. \nThis was the third time he was in Somalia to fight Al Shabaab. Last year, he narrowly escaped death after the militia group attacked them along the Kenya-Somalia border. \nALSO READ: Oparanya wants KDF withdrawn from Somalia \n\"Last time he visited us at home I asked him to resign but it seems he did not want to do so. He kept quiet only to tell me he signed a contract to serve the country,\" said Mr Iravonga. \n\"He did not tell me when he went back to Somalia. I just got information from his wife that their camp in Somalia was attacked and he was among those who perished.\" \nMourners have been streaming into the family's home in Kapsotik village, Vihiga County, to condole with them as they struggle to come to terms with the sudden death of their loved one. \nIravonga said he will miss his son who used to send him money for family upkeep and paid fees for his siblings. \n\"He was supportive of the family. He did not neglect anyone. I am in a dilemma and I do not know what to do next,\" said the father. \nHis mother, Rosemary Ayuma, said: \"He had a lot of plans but they are gone with the wind. He was a happy and disciplined son. I will miss him.\" \nMs Kendi said raising her two children, who are in lower primary school, without her husband will be hard for her.
