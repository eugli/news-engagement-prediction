Elvira (Evanston Police Department) Pioneer Press Staff report \nEvanston police arrested two men Thursday in connection with an early morning burglary at a local specialty grocery store. \nNicholas A. Economos, 29, of the 2800 block of West Glenlake in Chicago, and Alejandro J. Elvira, 21, of the 9200 block of Fairway Drive in Des Plaines, were each charged with felony burglary after police said they broke into the J.D. Mills Health Food store. \nPolice responded around 5:20 a.m. Thursday to a call that two men had broken a glass door at the store, which is located in the 600 block of Chicago Avenue, said Evanston police Cmdr. Joe Dugan. \nThe pair allegedly entered the store and then were seen leaving, fleeing in a SUV that police said they had been given a description of. \nAccording to a news release police issued late Thursday announcing the charges, an officer who responded to the scene noticed a vehicle matching the description given and tried to stop the driver near Sheridan Road and Jarvis Avenue. \nPolice said the two men in the vehicle – later identified as Economos and Elvira – did not stop. Police caught up with the vehicle again in the 1300 block of Estes Avenue, according to the news release, but the men got out of the vehicle and ran. \nThe men were captured by police following a short foot chase, according to the news release. \nAccording to police, the owner of the store reported that the cash register was \"significantly damaged\" after the suspects tried unsuccessfully to open it. However, nothing was reported stolen from the store, police said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T12:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T08:03:24.956+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
