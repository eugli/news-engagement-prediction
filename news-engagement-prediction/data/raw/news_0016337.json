Now, 30-plus women have signed on to that complaint.\nOne woman, who claimed she also fathered a son from Contin, told investigators that the priest also encouraged her to have sex with a horse andbeat her twice in the church's rectory.He was also allegedly using wife-swapping sites to lend his lovers out to other men.\nContin initially denied the allegations, butpolice ended upfinding hard drives of porn andvideo evidence of the bacchanals,filmed by another priest namedRoberto Cavazzana,in his possession. According to the Sun , the sex parties appeared to have taken place in the church's rectory, or clergy residence , rather than on the altar next to the crucifixor whatever. Regardless, both men reportedlyadmitted to the allegations and came cleanto the parish's bishop,Monsignor Claudio Cipolla,last week.\n\"The behavior of Father Andrea was in complete contrast with the commitments he made to the church,\"Cipolla said at a press conference . \"He had an objectionable lifestyle and, as such, is not eligible to exercise the priestly ministry. His actions have also compromised him to such an extent he can no longer represent himself as a priest, even after his repentance.\"\nContin also supposedly had more than 30 loverswho he took to fancy dinners andon retreats to a nudist camp in France, so the guy was keeping busy. \"He always carried a briefcase full of vibrators, sex toys, masks, and bondage equipment,\" one of his accusers reportedly told authorities.\nOf course, Catholic priests take a vow of chastity when they receive their holy ordersso he's at least guilty of breaking that rule, if not several others. Police are now investigating Contin forpsychological and physical assault,as well as facilitating prostitution, although he reportedly hasn't been arrested yet.\n\"Even if, at the end of this affair, there are no legal consequences, we have a duty by canon law to take disciplinary action,\" Cipolla said, who has already started the process to get Contin defrocked.\nContin's filmmaking counterpart,Cavazzana,will likelynot face expulsion from the church, Cipolla says, because his involvement was \"partial and occasional,\" though still \"unacceptable.\" Two other priests are also thought to have engaged in the orgies, which is almost certainlynot the way the Catholic Church wants its ministers to come together.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T06:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:01:40.253+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
