Public Health Minister Ferozuddin Feroz said 41 people were wounded, including 10 in critical condition.\nRELATED CONTENT Obama leaves complicated legacy in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria In restoring a century-old palace, a step toward rebuilding Afghanistan’s independence No one immediately claimed the attack, which bore the hallmarks of the Taliban. The insurgents have been at war with the U.S.-backed government for 15 years and have increasingly targeted the judiciary since the execution of six convicted insurgents last May.\nShortly after the executions, a suicide bomber targeted a minibus carrying court employees in Kabul during the morning rush hour, killing 11 people in an attack claimed by the Taliban, which called it an act of revenge.\nIn June, three Taliban fighters stormed a court building in the eastern Logar province, killing seven people, including a newly appointed chief prosecutor, before being shot dead by police.\nElsewhere in Afghanistan, a roadside bomb killed a top district official in the western Farah province as he returned home from a mosque, local police spokesman Iqbal Baher said.
