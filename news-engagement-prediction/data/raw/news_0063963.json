I was aware of former football players, legends who I grew up watching, suffering from dementia. \n\"Could this affect football and footballers too? The more I read about it, the more I felt this was a subject that could no longer be ignored.” Read More Alan Shearer has headed the ball for years (Photo: BBC) \nAlan will meet footballers and their families affected by dementia before turning himself over to science. \nHe will undergo a variety of cutting edge medical tests, including bio marker blood tests and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to uncover what condition his body and brain is in. \nThe science is not straightforward and there have been calls for more tests. \nAlan will seek out scientific opinion that casts doubt on a direct link between dementia and brain damage caused by heading the ball. Alan Shearer will take part in the BBC documentary (Photo: BBC) \nHe will also challenge football’s governing bodies on this potentially growing problem that is causing outrage in footballing communities as an issue that’s been ignored and neglected for years. \nThe one off documentary was one of a host of new factual programming announced by the BBC on Thursday.
