The inaugural edition is scheduled for September 22-24 at the O2 Arena in Prague. The following year, it moves to the United States.\n\"The idea is to absolutely have a tough tournament, tough matches, the better man wins, that's the idea of the Laver Cup,\" Federer said on Monday.\nTo promote the competition, Federer played some rallies against Tomas Berdych on a boat cruising the Vltava river to a crowd watching from the famed Charles Bridge.\nBjorn Bjorg will captain Europe while John McEnroe will do the same for the opponents. The tournament is to honor Rod Laver, an 11-time major champion who won two calendar-year Grand Slams.\nNo ATP rankings points will be awarded, but Federer insisted that an exhibition \"is not how the captains see it, that's not how Rod Laver sees it. He wants us to represent our part of the world with pride and try our very best and also win for our teammates.\"\nThe teams won't be named until after the US Open, but it's not clear yet if all players who will formally qualify via the rankings will be available.\nWhat is for certain, organizers said, is that Federer and Rafael Nadal , the finalists at this year's Australian Open, will be on the European team.\nWith Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka possibly on the team, Europe seems to be the one to beat.\n\"On paper, we look as the big favorites,\" Federer said. \"We have more depth in Team Europe that we can choose from.\"\nThe tournament will include three singles and one doubles match every day. Federer was clear about his choice of his possible partner for the doubles.\n\"I guess I would love to play with Rafa just because of our rivalry has been so special,\" Federer said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T16:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T05:07:33.168+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
