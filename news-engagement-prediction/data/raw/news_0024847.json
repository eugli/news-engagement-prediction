Johnson/HBO \nThandie Newton is the latest performer to orbit the Young Han Solo movie, which has already begun shooting. \nThe Westworld actress would take an unspecified role in the film, EW has confirmed, which is set several years before we meet the galactic smuggler in that Tatooine cantina in the original Star Wars film. Variety first reported the news of her involvement. \nNewton would join Alden Ehrenreich as Han, Donald Glover as Lando Calrissian, Woody Harrelson as an as-yet-unnamed mentor, and Emilia Clarke as another mystery character. Phoebe Waller-Bridge , the star of the Amazon series Fleabag, will play a performance-capture character. \nNewton recently stole the HBO series Westworld as Maeve, an increasingly self-aware robot who has flashbacks of a different programming life involving a lost little girl. The role earned her supporting actress nominations for both the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild Awards. \nThe LEGO Movie and 21 Jump Street filmmakers Phil Lord and Chris Miller are directing the Young Han Solo film, and the untitled movie is set for release in 2018. \nFor more Star Wars news, follow @Breznican .
