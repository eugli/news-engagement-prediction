This brings a new level of bragging rights to advertising creatives, whose work doesn’t too often reside next to masterful fine art. \nThe call for entries for the 2017 AICP Awards amusingly plays up this perk by pitting giants of art and advertising against each other—in three comic videos that look at who actually has more work in MoMA. \nWe have Susan Credle versus Vincent Van Gogh, Jeff Kling versus Jeff Koons, and Gerry Graf versus Paul Cezanne. In all three cases, the counts are close—Graf actually has as many pieces in MoMA as Cezanne, while Credle and Kling are only slightly behind their adversaries. \nBut the comedy here is of the self-mocking variety (Credle, Koons and Graf each penned their own script), pitting clear lasting cultural treasures against the more goofy, ephemeral nature of even the most lauded advertising. \nCheck out the videos here: \n“The conversation about art and advertising is over—it’s now about Art vs. Advertising as creative rivalries percolate across media platforms,” said Matt Miller, president and CEO of AICP. “The archive at MoMA is a huge achievement, offering unequaled prestige to artists of all walks as they strive for creative recognition.” \nThe concept came from Nick Law, global chief creative officer at R/GA and 2017 AICP Next Awards judging chair, and Jay Zasa, executive creative director at R/GA, along with R/GA creative directors Mike Donaghey and Chris Joakim. \nEnter the AICP Show and AICP Next Awards here. \nCREDITS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:24:51.277+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
