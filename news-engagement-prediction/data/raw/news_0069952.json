For Real Madrid players getting one over on Cristiano Ronaldo must be one of life's greatest pleasures, just ask Marcelo. \nA personal favourite of the little battles was knowing as a full back that all of the goals you conceded came from the other side and being able to smugly acknowledge that \"we concede as a team\" knowing full well it wasn't your fault, it didn't happen very often. Marcelo pays respect to his mortal enemy! \nFellow full back Marcelo, ha as if I've just written that, must get mightily annoyed from having to mark Cristiano Ronaldo during training, Knowing everyday that you'll come up against him in five-a-side and even if you could get near him you can't properly take him out as he's really your teammate. \nSo it's no surprise that when, for once in his life, Ronaldo was on the wrong end of being embarrassed Marcelo took particular delight in it. The Portuguese superstar was nutmegged by Casemiro during training and Marcelo's reaction is a little odd: \n(Credit: Real Madrid ) \nRonaldo seems to take being megged pretty well and you imagine that the scene at Barcelona is similarly triumphant on those few and far between occasions when Lionel Messi gets 'done' in training. \nAnd it's no wonder people are happy to see him get a taste of his own medicine when he's busy doing this kind of thing at the weekend: Ronaldinho, King of ElasticoLeo Messi, King of NutmegCristiano Ronaldo, The King Of Elastico Nutmeg pic.twitter.com/saX5enUsTd \nIt'll be a while till Marcelo gets his own revenge! \nWhich footballer would you most like to get revenge on by embarrassing them for once?
