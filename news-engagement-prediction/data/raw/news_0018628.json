She used to live there alone. \nHer family lodged the complaint at Garfa police station on Wednesday. \n“The family members of the victim alleged that the income tax officer, who is also married drove her to suicide. However, we have to wait till we receive the post mortem report to be sure whether she was murdered, or whether she killed herself. Depending on that we will decide whether to start a case of murder, or abetment to suicide,” said an officer at Garfa police station. \nFor the moment, police has registered a case of unnatural death. \nSaha starred in the October 2016 Bengali film Banchha Elo Firey, which is a sequel to a superhit Bengali film Bancharamer Bagan made in 1980. On Tuesday, her friends reached her apartment in the evening after failing to contact her since afternoon. \nThey broke the door to find her body hanging. \nThe report of the post mortem is expected to reach the police on Wednesday night. From preliminary investigation, the police suspect it was a case of suicide because there were sharp cut marks on both of her wrists. \n“The angle of failed love affair is being probed as her recent social media posts indicate she was suffering from depression,” a police officer said. \nSaha started living alone in the rented apartment a few months ago after she left her home, apparently over her family’s objections to the relationship with the IT officer. \nOn Wednesday, however, her family members claimed that she started avoiding the officer but he continued to harass her. “It was his continuous harassment and pressure on her to continue with the relationship that forced her to kill herself. One cannot even rule out murder,” a member of her family said. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T20:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:55:00.616+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
