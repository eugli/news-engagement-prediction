South Korea placed fourth. \nThe men who could look forward to the longest lives in 2015 were in Switzerland, Iceland and Australia -- all within a few decimal points of an 81 year lifespan. \nFrom 2010 to 2030, South Korean women are set to add 6.6 years to an average lifespan, followed by Slovenia (4.7) and Portugal (4.4). \nAmong men, the big gains will be Hungary (7.5 years), South Korea (7.0) and Slovenia (6.4). \nThe United States will see only a moderate gain over the same two decades, from 81.2 to 83.3 years for women, and 76.5 to 79.5 years for men. \nIn 2015, the five countries with the lowest life expectancy -- ranging from 50 to less than 55 years for men and women -- were all in sub-Saharan Africa. \nOutside periods of war or famine, life expectancy in wealthy nations has risen almost continuously since the 19th century, from roughly 50 to 80 years. \n(AFP) ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T12:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T07:33:31.827+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
