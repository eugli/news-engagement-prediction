Drake and 21 Savage’s “Sneakin'” video found it’s way back into the top 3 Hip Hop singles and videos of the week and Wizkid’s Drizzy-assisted cut “Hush Up The Silence” maintains it’s top position. André 3000 Is GOAT \nAs half of Outkast, André 3000 is one the most treasured Hip Hop figures within the culture. While most people are excited over a 3 Stacks feature, fans and lovers of the genre have yet to experience a solo project from him and for this, many are reluctant to include him in the GOAT conversations. \nIs it warranted?

The Love For Drake & 21 Savage’s “No Sneakin'” Video Reigns Supreme \n“No Sneakin'” is a clear fan favorite as it’s time in the Top 10 list has been cemented since November. \nThe track originally debuted on OVO Radio and the visual was released on Apple Music as a low-res video filmed within the confines of the YOLO Estates. Wizkid’s Drake-Featured Track “Hush Up The Silence” Remains Hot \nNigerian superstar Wizkid teamed up with Drake for another banger, “Hush Up The Silence.” Since it’s release, traffic for this cut has remained high. \nThe two have had major success with VIEWS cut “One Dance,” and this song seems to be doing just as well. \nView the Top 10 most popular singles and videos on DX for the week ending February 3 below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T22:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T01:34:01.270+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
