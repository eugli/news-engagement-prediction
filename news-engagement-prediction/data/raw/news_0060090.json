One of fashion’s busiest women, Teigen juggles regular television appearances and high-profile modeling work (especially for Sports Illustrated ) with writing a best-selling cookbook and running one of the most opinionated social media feeds in the business. Many claim to be multitaskers, but Teigen’s flourishing career has shown the breadth of the opportunities available for models with personality, something she has plenty of. On the set of her first Vogue shoot, her enthusiasm —particularly for legendary makeup artist Pat McGrath—was palpable. “I was just so excited to see her and work with her, because she’s just as amazing as everybody has always said she is,” says Teigen. “Her team is amazing; they’re so ready to learn from one another, which I think is cool. I just love being a part of a team where so many people come together to make something beautiful.” Teigen’s ability to be a team player has made her a staple within the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. Rookies come and go, but the brand’s biggest stars can last decades. With a cover under her belt and her eighth issue hitting stands this month, she’s now among the magazine’s most recognizable faces, but the thrill of the tropical trips and beachfront shoots hasn’t faded. “They’re fun because you get to work with your family. I’ve been with them for eight years now,” says Teigen, who credits editor MJ Day and photographer James Macari with keeping the vibe upbeat. “When you go back with them, and you get to go to this exotic, beautiful location, you can’t say no to that. You know it’s going to be fun.” Though early call times and posing in body paint can be difficult, there’s always a little joy to be found on set. “Everyone goes surfing or does something cool. I go kayaking or whatever. Then you start again at sunset. It’s just a beautiful, beautiful trip. And you end up getting these amazing photos out of it. It’s a win-win for everybody.” The sultry vibe of Teigen’s swim portfolio carries over into her red carpet style, with daring pieces from Balmain and Dries Van Noten garnering headlines. While the sultry looks she pulls out for big events are followed by blogs and fan sites, she admits she’s more interested in feeling good than in making the best dressed list. “I go for comfort. I’m at that stage—my stylist, Monica Rose, will tell you! I take the worst Polaroids. When I put on an outfit, I’m not like, This is sick!” jokes Teigen. “I love to play dress-up, though, so it’s nice to have those moments, but my personal style is very simple.” Preferring athleisure or classic black and white, Teigen keeps things understated.

As hideous as I think those outfits are—and sometimes they are hideous—they make her happy.” Teigen’s candor is refreshing, especially on Twitter, where she isn’t afraid to go toe to toe with haters and professional agitators like Piers Morgan. Where most celebrities carefully curate their feeds with perfectly airbrushed pictures and scheduled tweets, Teigen keeps it real with updates on everything from what she’s cooking to Arthur memes. Her accounts are unfiltered, which according to Teigen is the point of this platform. “I think a lot of people tend to share only the best on social media. It gives everyone this false hope that their lives should be perfect, and everything should be beautiful, and your latte is always going to have a heart in it,” she says. “It’s this weird little dream world for people, and I think it’s important for people to see the reality so they know that they’re not the only ones out there who are going through weird shit.” The balance between the weird and wonderful is something Teigen gets. She’s not your typical supermodel, which is part of her appeal. By embracing her strengths—whether delivering rapid-fire tweets or sharing the best recipe for wings—Teigen has carved out her own niche. Bringing her infectious energy wherever she goes, she’s always ready for the nextadventure—like heading out on tour with her husband, John Legend. “Honestly, I love being on the bus. It’s just like a touring life that’s a family life. You see a sign that says ‘Aquarium Next Left.’ You’re like, ‘Let’s all go to the aquarium!’” Teigen has no plans to slow down anytime soon, and with TV shows, modeling, and a brand-new book all on the horizon, her future looks bright.
