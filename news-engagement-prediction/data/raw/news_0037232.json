But staff at the special care baby unit where he was cared for in the days after his delivery had expressed 'no child protection concerns'. Maternity ward medics did, however, tell the council they were anxious about the couple's long-term ability to care for their baby. Among other things, they said the father had 'expressed unorthodox views about the need for sterilisation of bottles and the benefits of formula milk.' Just before the baby was due to be discharged from hospital into his parents' care, the council rushed to court and obtained an emergency care order. The judge was told that the parents were 'on notice' of the hearing and had 'agreed' to their baby being taken away from them. Kirklees council (headquarters pictured) has been ordered to pay the family £11,250 damages The council also 'forgot to notify Cafcass' (which represents children in family court cases) about the case so there was no lawyer present to represent the baby boy's interests. Mr Justice Cobb said the couple were in fact 'unaware' of the hearing and were 'understandably very upset' when they were told about it. A spate of further hearings followed and the baby was finally sent home to his parents about three months after his removal. In the year since then, the judge said the boy had 'continued to thrive in his parents care'. He added: 'There is no doubt in my mind, indeed it is admitted, that Kirklees Council breached the human rights of a baby boy and his parents. 'I am satisfied that the breaches were serious... the separation of a baby from his parents represents a very serious interference with family life.' The failure to notify the parents of the care hearing was 'particularly egregious' and involved 'misleading the judge no fewer than three times'. Awarding the mother, the father and the little boy £3,750 damages each, the judge said that was 'just and fair satisfaction' for the wrongs done to them. Mr Justice Cobb also ordered the council to pay a substantial of the £120,000 in legal costs run up in the case.
