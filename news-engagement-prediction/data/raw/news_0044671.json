I know this because I took one of their tickets (Richard’s, I like to think), after a schoolfriend won them from the presenters when they decided to give them away on their Channel 4 show. We were 16 and into guitars, eyeliner and pretending to be more miserable than we actually were, but even we figured a day out in the “golden circle” bit of Hyde Park was worth going along to. \nAfterwards, Richard and Judy invited us onto the show to tell them, and the millions of housewives watching, what they had missed. On live television, I lost what little credibility I had gained from three years of reading the NME, and said: “Robbie Williams was actually really good”. Thankfully, YouTube wouldn’t be created for another seven months. That recording remains on a VHS tape in an attic somewhere in Buckinghamshire. \nT hing is, Robbie Williams actually was really good. While I had grown up disliking him, and Take That , purely because my older sister adored his cheeky grin, it was impossible to his curious magic: an alchemy of camp, bravado and vulnerability that has kept Williams firmly in the papers and the charts since his emergence as the naughty one in Take That in the early Nineties. \nBy the time he burst out onto that stage in Hyde Park, nine years had passed since he had been kicked out of Take That. Williams had created several soaring karaoke staples ( Angels , Millennium , Let Me Entertain You ) and sold a $80 million record contract. Aged 30, he was on the cusp of releasing his greatest hits. \nWhile Robbie has had many fallings from grace, he has always managed to remain adored by the public. His drug use and sexual profligacy has been well-documented, not least by him: one of his most famous quotes is the admission that he’s “the only man who can say he's been in Take That and at least two members of the Spice Girls”. Cracking a gag face: Robbie, second from right, with Take That \nR ather, Williams’ most embarrassing moments have been his musical failings his career during the second half of the Noughties was marred by a string of increasingly weak album releases, starting with Rudebox , on which Williams adopted both a Jamaican patois and a West Yorkshire accent, and tailing out with Songbook, a compilation album that was given away for free with the Mail on Sunday. \nAnd yet even these didn’t diminish his sparkle for long. Williams may have announced his retirement from live performance in 2006 – during the opening of a world tour so bad that he offered the audience refunds – but, a decade on, he can still command national headlines after playing a show. When milllions watched him liberally apply hand sanitiser after greeting the crowd during his New Year’s Eve televised performance, he explained himself by saying he uses the stuff even after touching his own family.

Williams is a proven hitmaker, thanks in considerable part to his collaborations with producer Guy Chambers , and, as my teenage self will attest, he is a winning performer , supplying a heady concoction of genuine stage patter, passable vocals and showmanship. It’s not surprising that he continues to return to the swing giants of Frank Sinatra and Fred Astaire : they created the feel-good, effortless performance he has revamped for a 21st-century audience. \nBut above all, the reason why Williams continues to please crowds – and earn more Brit Awards than any other artist, including, in 2017, the Icon Award – is because he possesses the kind of oddity that the British public enjoy in their best-loved stars. Robbie will never have the innovation of Bowie or the sexual magnetism of Jagger, but the three of them share an eccentricity – and the ability to laugh at themselves for it. \nWilliams’ wackiness and refusal to develop a Hollywood gloss, is a big part of why he failed to break America. But it’s exactly why, in the UK, we’ll never quite turn our back on him.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:45:44.915+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
