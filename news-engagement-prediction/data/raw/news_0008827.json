He is a tireless agent of disruption and an unbending force for creative destruction,” the Washington Times gushes.\nWhile revolutions involve a forcible overthrow of power structures, rather than a democratic process however flawed, the actions of the new president via executive fiat are feeding the story of fundamental upheaval.\nThe revolution discourse touches deep into currents at the centre of Trump’s appeal, building on his narrative that he is addressing a crisis, not creating it, that he is upending a rotten system on behalf of the people.\nAnd as this week’s Essential Report illustrates the mood for fundamental change is afoot in Australia, too.\nThinking about our current political and economic system – that is, the structures that set the rules for the way Australian society operates – which of the following best describes your view? Forty per cent of Australian voters agree with statement that “the system needs to be fundamentally changed”. For a nation built on a centrist battle between centre-right and centre-left political parties, this is a significant number, a presage to the rise of political outsiders.\nIt’s worth noting that the majority of voters lending support to the likes of Hanson, Xenophon, independents and minor parties agree with the statement that the system needs to be fundamentally overturned.\nIn contrast, the majority of Green voters prefer to work within the current system than tear it down altogether, a caution to the insurgents seeking more radical politics.\nMeanwhile just 6% of voters say the current economic and political system is working well and does not need to be changed in any substantial way.\nPrevious Essential polling suggests that at the core of these sentiments are three inter-connected veins: cultural panics linked to national security, economic disenfranchisement and a collapse in trust in political institutions.\nTrump has moved swiftly to exploit all three veins. Closing the borders in the name of American security, suspending trade deals in the name of American jobs and undermining trust by personal example.\nSo does the desire for fundamental change mean we are on the road to a Trump-style revolution? Our polling suggests it’s a case of same, same but different.\nOn national security, there’s an argument Australia was well ahead of the Trumpian curve, excising parts of our sovereign borders and suspending our international obligations in the name of border security.\nEven as asylum seekers languish on Manus Island and Nauru, a quarter of Australians think the government’s approach is too soft . Meanwhile half the population warm to Pauline Hanson’s call for a ban on Muslim immigrants . \nOn trust in our institutions, politicians are plumbing new depths of public regard – not just the political parties, but the parliaments and the representative bodies like unions, religious organisations and business bodies.\nHow much trust do you have in the following institutions and organisations? Note : ‘Total Trust’ is an aggregate figure achieved by adding ‘A lot of trust’ and ‘Some trust’ But on trade issues, the Australian public appears to break with Trump’s economic message, with three times as many of us believing that free trade agreements have been for the national good:\n\nGenerally, do you think making free trade agreements with other countries is good for Australia or bad for Australia? A majority also believe that the Australian government should push on with the Trans-Pacific Partnership , despite (or possibly because of ) Trump’s decision to walk away.\nThis doesn’t mean there is widespread support for the current orthodoxy of trickle down economics – corporate tax cuts and service cuts to reign in deficit models – the model of economic management that has become a default of the Australian system.\nAustralia doesn't need to chase Donald Trump on corporate tax cuts | Lenore Taylor Read more \nAustralians tell us they want governments that will stand up to corporations who don’t pay their taxes, even if it risks them not investing here.\nThey tell us they want governments that support industries that create local jobs and who use their purchasing power to support companies who treat their workers decently. But they don’t simplistically want their nation to turn its back on the opportunities of our region and our common responsibilities.\nTrump’s self-styled “revolution” will dominate our political debates over the coming months and years; but it will be the lived example of his brand of systemic destruction that is likely to do more to keep things stable here than any Fabian treatise.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T08:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T05:42:43.853+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
