According to Page Six, the couple have purchased a luxury apartment at One Hundred East Fifty Third Street, and it's really something special. Although the couple did not opt for the penthouse, listed for $65 million, they reportedly went for a unit in the skyscraper building, which is expected to be completed next year. The site reports that George and Amal decided this would be the perfect location to buy an apartment because of its close proximity to the United Nations for Amal, who will also be teaching at Columbia Law School. But of course, the over-the-top \"hotel-like\" amenities did help convince the couple. \nThe first two levels of the building are occupied by French chef Joël Robuchon with a gourmet marketplace and restaurant. There's a wellness facility with a Pilates and ballet room, a yoga room, a sauna and steam room, a 60-foot sunlit swimming pool, and so much more. The building has full concierge services with a \"dedicated lifestyle manager, global travel agents, personal shopping, and priority event access.\" Each residence will have 11-foot ceilings and jaw-dropping views likely to take your breath away. Keep reading to see all the photos inside George and Amal's stunning new NYC building.
