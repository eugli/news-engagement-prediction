(Photo: Susan Walsh/AP) \nAs primetime reality-TV political theater, President Donald Trump’s nomination of Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court Tuesday night was a disappointment.\nThat’s a good thing.\nWhen Trump began tweeting that he would make the announcement from the White House in East Coast primetime, people naturally wondered: Would this be a stunt? When word spread that Trump had summoned Gorsuch and Thomas Hardiman, the other favorite for the pick, to Washington for the announcement, you couldn’t help but wonder: Would Trump trot both out in front of the cameras and hand a gavel to one? Perhaps pull a reversal on his “Apprentice” catch phrase, point to Gorsuch and say, “You’re hired?”\nMORE GOODY: Trump on Dr. Oz: Everything's a reality show? | Trump the TV critic: 'SNL' skit a 'hit job' | Covering Trump's lies no simple task | Criticize Trump, get a mean tweet? \nAs it turned out, with a couple of exceptions, Trump was pretty low-key in his announcement. (And he is not the first president to announce his selection in primetime – George W. Bush did so when he announced John Roberts as his pick in 2005.) He walked up to the podium, said what he had to say and invited Gorsuch to speak. And this is not a man who gives up the microphone easily.\nBut he did, and Gorsuch said all the things one would expect of someone in his position.\nAs for Trump, he did say a couple of things that were a little odd for such an occasion.\n“Was that a surprise?” he asked after the announcement. “Was it?”\nDoes it matter?\nIn this Friday, Jan. 27, 2017, photograph, 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Neil Gorsuch makes a point while delivering prepared remarks before a group of attorneys at a luncheon in a legal firm in lower downtown Denver.   (Photo: David Zalubowski/AP) \nAnd of course the selection “may be the most transparent judicial process in history,” and Gorsuch is “said to be among the finest and most brilliant” (he got a lot of agreement on that front from pundits afterwards).\nThe statement that got the biggest social-media eye roll was, “I am a man of my word. I will do as I say – something the American people have been asking for from Washington for a very, very long time.”\nCable-news networks covered the story like a blanket all day, as you’d expect, and broadcast networks broke into primetime for coverage. Some on social media complained about this – they shouldn’t give Trump the attention, they said.\nThat’s a ridiculous notion.\nRELATED: Defiant Trump mocks Democrats over immigration order​ | Our View: President Donald Trump, our commander in chaos​ | Fact check: Trump’s immigration policy vs. Obama's​ \nWhether you like or hate Trump, he is the president, and he’s carrying out his obligation to nominate a candidate to fill the post. This was not some self-serving justification of his recent immigration ban. (Sorry. “Ban.”) This was important, crucial, information we need to know. It was real news, not the “fake news” both sides have used in attempts to demean media.\nIf you are a news organization, you cover news, no matter who is making it. Trump made it Tuesday night, in surprisingly muted fashion. It’s not a refutation of the fireworks of the last week, but maybe it’s a start.\nReach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontz@arizonarepublic.com. Facebook: facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.
