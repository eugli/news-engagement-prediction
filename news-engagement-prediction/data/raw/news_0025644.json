Watch Whales Get Wild In An Ocean Threesome \nPassengers on a whale-watching tour were treated to a surprise when they spotted not two, but what appeared to be three gray whales mating off the coast of Newport, California earlier this month. The intriguing footage captured the three cetaceans encircling and rolling around each other while dolphins swim nearby. The footage was shot via drone by Mark Girardeau. \nWhat appears to be mating, however, is simply an elaborate courtship in which two males can be seen attempting to mate with a female. \nChristopher Fitzsimmons, an education specialist at the Birch Aquarium at Scripps Institution of Oceanography , explained that mating in pods of three, with two males and a female, is entirely common among gray whales. \n\"This rolling and rubbing we see is believed to be the whales familiarizing themselves with one another and making sure the female is receptive to mating,\" said Fitzsimmons. \nGray whales engage in often elaborate courtship practices before mating. Males will use their pectoral fins to coerce and align females into mating positions. Females have even been observed avoiding the attempts of males for days. \nBruce Mate, director of the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University , confirmed that no actual copulation takes place in the video. One of the males can be seen with his penis out two minutes into the footage, but by turning her back to the male, the female signals a lack of interest. Because gray whales must mate belly to belly, this rolling behavior is the most obvious signal that a female is either uninterested or testing the rigor of the male. \nYou Might Also Like", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T07:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T06:11:16.523+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
