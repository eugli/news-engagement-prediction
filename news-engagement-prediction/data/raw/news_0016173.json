Contact \n\"The 59 affected employees are applicable for redundancy and ABB is engaging the assistance of professional support people who will be regularly on site and providing access to an employee assistance program (EAP) for counselling,\" it said. \n\"ABB will also support employees with CV writing, interview skills training and job search training. Ad Feedback \n\"Efforts will be made to find suitable alternative employment in the wider ABB organisation, where possible.\" \nIt said the closure would not have an impact on its New Zealand customers as the oil-filled distribution class transformers, which had been made in New Plymouth, would be sourced from its regional factory setup in Vietnam. \nIn 2012 the New Plymouth factory underwent a $1.5m extension. \nAt the time, ABB factory sales manager Tania Lindsay said the company could employ another 20-odd people in 2013 if it went ahead with plans to add a third shift to its production. \nIt was also suggested the factory could become a 24-hour operation to keep up with demand. \nABB had secured a new portion of the Australian market which had led to the large expansion, she said. \nIn the past ABB was producing about 2000 transformers each year but increased this to 4000 a year in 2012. \n\"We want to move up to be doing 10,000 per year. To do that we would go to a 24-hour operation,\" she had said. \nIt is unclear what had changed in the market since then and caused the closure, and whether ABB still had the portion of the Australian market that it did five years ago. \nABB produces small distribution transformers for the New Zealand market, as well as internationally for Australia and the Pacific Islands. \nThe power and automation technology specialists owned companies in about 100 countries and employed about 145,000 people. \n\"Going forward, transformer technology and production remains a core business and priority for ABB,\" ABB's statement said. \nTransformer orders would still be placed through ABB Limited, it said, and it would stock them locally to meet customer needs. \nABB had been at its Paraite Rd site in Bell Block under various names since 1959, former ABB Ltd general manager Deane Hogg said in 2012. \nAbout 30 per cent of ABB's revenue came from Australia, 10 per cent from the Pacific Islands and the rest from New Zealand, he said. \nAustralia was a growing market for ABB because production costs in New Zealand were much cheaper than in Australia, he said. \n\"I think oil and gas business over there drives up a lot of the costs,\" Hogg said. \nThe new business in Australia had increased ABB's revenue by about 30 per cent, he said. \nLast year the ABB Group decided to move some production from Australia to New Zealand, he said. \nABB has been asked to clarify what factors caused the closure, as well as how many staff are currently employed at the factory.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T11:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T06:35:32.634+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
