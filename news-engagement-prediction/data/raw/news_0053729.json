His early albums like Aku Penghiburmu (1978), Perasaan (1979), Anak Muda (1980), Lagu Anak Desa (1980) and Lagu Dari Kota (1981) laid the foundations for his illustrious career that took him beyond Malaysia. \nFellow artist Datuk D.J Dave paid tribute to Sudirman, saying that he was one of the greatest, creative and hardworking performers in the country. \nHe recalled one time when Sudirman was very sick in hospital but the entertainer still snuck out to sing for his fans for a wshow. \n“He went against all odds, saying that he had to keep his appointment with his fans. He went for the show even though he was sick. We lost one of the greatest entertainers who had it all,” he said. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T10:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:37:55.459+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
