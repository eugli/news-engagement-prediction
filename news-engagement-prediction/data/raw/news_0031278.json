According to her website , she’s a “singer, actress and vegan health coach.” Is that ringing any bells for anyone? Because I’ve got nothing. \nIt’s unclear how she got an invite to the Grammys in the first place because she’s not on the nominees list anywhere. \nNevertheless, she did apparently somehow worm her way onto the red carpet. And I’ll give her this: This unknown girl knows how to make herself known. Because here’s the dress ol’ what’s-her-face debuted on the carpet: REX/Shutterstock \nYep, that’s a dress that says “Make America Great Again,” aka the slogan from President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign. And the back of her dress read “TRUMP” in sparkly letters. \n— mya 19 (@youngodss) February 12, 2017 She even made it super dramatic by ~revealing~ the dress from under a cape. REX/Shutterstock She proceeded to whip off the cape with a flourish while on the carpet. REX/Shutterstock \nYep. She did that, I guess? Again, to reiterate, no one knows who the hell this lady is. All Wikipedia could tell me about Joy Villa is she has a “failing career” and this dress is a plea for “attention.” Wikipedia \nSounds pretty accurate to me! Unsurprisingly, Twitter had very little patience for this political stunt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T07:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T03:14:41.817+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
