John Edgerton was arrested at the US Capitol.\nA minister at the Old South Church in Boston was arrested on Capitol Hill this week for protesting efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\nThe Rev. John Edgerton, 35, an associate minister at the historic Back Bay church, was among 47 people taken into custody on Tuesday during a demonstration that included other faith leaders, health care workers with the Service Employees International Union, and people who say they depend on the coverage provided by former President Obama’s landmark health reform law.\nAdvertisement\nAs Republican lawmakers consider throwing out the measure with no agreed-upon plan for how to replace it, Edgerton said he was compelled to make sure key senators heard the concerns of those affected.\n“We were trying to communicate very clearly to them that ordinary American people will just not accept a repeal of the Affordable Care Act. It’s too important,” Edgerton said Wednesday, after returning from Washington.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. Sign The arrests happened after demonstrators unfurled a sign that read “What’s your plan?” outside of the office of Utah Senator Orrin G. Hatch and four other Republican senators, a violation of the rules of the Capitol.\nView Story 200 rally for immigration legislation A crowd rallied on Boston Common in favor of a state bill that would prevent police from assisting federal immigration officials.\nIraqis who aided US eligible for visas, State Department says\nThe sign echoed a question the protesters had whispered in unison as they confronted Hatch earlier in the day. Hatch did not respond as one of the protesters shared a story about how the act had helped her children, Edgerton said. Hatch’s office had no comment.\nThe protesters were charged with “crowding, obstructing, or incommoding,” processed, and released, according to US Capitol Police.\nAndy Rosen can be reached at andrew.rosen@globe.com .
