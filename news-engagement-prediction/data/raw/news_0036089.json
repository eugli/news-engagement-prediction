Chance is known to represent his hometown of Chicago to the fullest, defending it all costs. It only makes sense that he would eventually comment on President Trump's questionable comments about the violence in Chicago. Trump was quoted as saying he would send in the \"Feds\" if Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel couldn't fix the issue. \nDuring an interview with theUndefeated alongside NBA player Jimmy Butler , he gave his comments on Trumps many tweets about his hometown. \"I hope he’s coming in to do some type of federal overturn of our state and city budgets in terms of schooling and housing,\" Chance says. \"I’m tired of n****s talkin’ about Chicago like it’s a Third World country. Like, that it’s not a place of booming business with a very successful downtown and all types of new development.\" \nChance then went on to say \"I don’t like to look at s— through that lens.\" { \"position1\" : { \"type\" : \"artist\", \"id\" : 846076, \"name\" : \"Chance the Rapper\" } } A post shared by espn (@espn) on Feb 15, 2017 at 6:46am PST ON AIR: Weekdays 2PM-6PM Angie Martinez is recognized as one of the most influential personalities in popular culture and multi-media. Originally known as “The Voice of New York,” Angie’s nearly 20 years of on-air hosting experience has led her to become the media trailblazer she is today: multimedia host, spokeswoman, actress, recording artist, entertainment personality, author and philanthropist. Known for her signature laid back style of interviewing, Angie is well respected — and praised — for her unique ability to get up-close and personal with larger-than-life personalities. Her storied experience and poise on the airwaves while interviewing such global icons as Bill & Hillary Clinton, Derek Jeter, Spike Lee, JAY Z and Beyoncé resulted in Martinez adding Special NY Correspondent for Extra TV to her current scope of work, where she has (so far) worked alongside Oprah Winfrey, Lady Gaga, Robert DeNiro and more. In addition to her professional work across the media landscape, Angie has become a passionate cultural voice for her community and fan base through HealthyLatinEating.com, which she founded in 2014 to share her love for — and support of — healthy Latin cuisine. And most recently, Angie dedicated herself to training for and completing the 2014 TCS New York City Marathon in support of The PitCCh In Foundation, where her team raised over $200,000 to benefit inner city youth. Fans can tune into The Angie Martinez Show on New York’s Power 105.1, weekdays from 2pm - 6pm, and on Miami’s The Beat 103.5, middays from 10am–2pm. Fans can also access The Angie Martinez Show through iHeartMedia.com and the iHeartMedia app. Contact ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T21:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T03:12:24.440+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
