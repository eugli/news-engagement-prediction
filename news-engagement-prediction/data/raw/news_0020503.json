Orrin Hatch Slams Elizabeth Warren for ‘Constant Diatribe’ Against Sessions by Josh Feldman | 10:59 pm, February 7th, 2017 video \nSenator Orrin Hatch spoke on the Senate floor tonight after colleague Elizabeth Warren was reprimanded for violating Rule 19, expressing that he had a problem with her “constant diatribe.” \nHatch, who was early to call Warren out on Twitter tonight as she read Coretta Scott King ‘s letter slamming AG nominee Jeff Sessions back in 1986 , said, “I find it offensive for either side to be criticizing, as was done here tonight, a sitting member of the Senate.” \nHe defended his colleague Sessions as a fine person who doesn’t deserve to be treated like a “terrible person.” Hatch lamented how much more heated the Senate has become and said this about Warren and her “constant diatribe”: \n“I listened to her for quite a while and she didn’t have a good thing to say about a fellow senator here, and I frankly don’t think that’s right. If we don’t respect each other, we’re going down a very steep path to oblivion.” \nHatch said that a lot of this is just Democrats being sore losers because of Donald Trump ‘s election victory, telling them that “treating a fellow senator with disdain” goes too far. \nWatch above, via C-SPAN 2. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T10:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T06:35:37.080+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
