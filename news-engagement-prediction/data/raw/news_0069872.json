Story continues below \nThursday’s forecast includes a mix of sun and cloud with a 60 per cent chance of showers or drizzle in the morning. \nIt wouldn’t be surprising to see some folks out in shorts and T-shirts as the clouds clear out and the sun makes an appearance this afternoon. \nThe temperature is expected to drop to a night time low of 2 C with showers beginning in the morning and a risk of a thunderstorm. \nHowever, the balmy weather won’t last for very long. Environment Canada meteorologist Mark Schuster told Global News significantly colder air will make its way into Southern Ontario by Sunday. \nToronto residents can look forward to more seasonable weather with a high of only 3 C on Sunday and below freezing temperatures during the evening hours for the first part of next week.
