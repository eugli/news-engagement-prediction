Think again \nSome argue that, far from motivating pro-social behaviours, empathy can push us towards inaction at best and racism and violence at worst Empathy can motivate generous behaviour and is a valuable aspect of relationships. But is it a good moral guide?

Our intuitive tendency to feel what we imagine another person is feeling is called ‘emotional empathy’. Empathy is, among other things, believed to improve our personal relationships , motivate charitable giving and encourage pro-social behaviours . The general consensus is that empathy is crucial to being a good person. \nBut empathy is not without its discontents . In his latest book, Against Empathy , Paul Bloom argues that empathy is actually a very poor moral guide. He compiles evidence from a range of sources to show that empathy can be innumerate, biased, parochial and inconsistent and can push us towards inaction at best and racism and violence at worst. Try it at home \nYou may be able to gain some insight into this controversial perspective by taking two different stances on the following scenario. This is an adapted example from a classic study done by Batson and colleagues in 1995 . In the first instance, read through the story and really try to imagine how the child feels and how it is affecting her life. Try to feel the full impact of what this child and her family have been through. \nSheri Summers is a bright 10-year-old girl who is suffering from a life-threatening condition which has already paralysed her. Unless she receives treatment soon it is likely that she will die. If she receives the treatment the condition can be reversed. However the treatment that could help her is only available via private healthcare and her family can not afford it. They have joined a children’s charity that helps families to pay for expensive treatments for life threatening diseases but she is far down the waiting list. You have the option of moving her to the top of the waiting list but doing so will mean that other children who are higher on the list due to earlier application, greater need or shorter life expectancy will have to wait longer. \nWould you choose to move her to the top of the queue? How about if you had read an interview with her that made clear just how much she was suffering and that her hopes were pinned on receiving this treatment? Now read the scenario again but this time try to take an objective perspective toward what is described. Try not to get caught up in how the child feels; just remain objective and detached. Are you more or less likely to move Sheri to the top of the queue? Empathy and its discontents \nBatson showed that when asked to be objective, respondents prioritised fairness - children who had been on the waiting list longer should be treated first. However, when asked to imagine how Sheri was feeling, to empathise with her, the majority of respondents voted to move Sheri to the front of the queue. \nThis is the crux of the problem with empathy as Bloom sees it. It is a spotlight that shines on individuals. This may work for close relationships but is a poor calculation when dealing with issues writ large that may impact on hundreds or thousands of people, on causes that have no single, identifiable victim, or victims that for whatever reason do not elicit our empathy. \nSecond, Bloom argues that empathy is inconsistent and biased. As you may have experienced in the example above, it sometimes takes just a subtle shift in context for our empathetic priorities to change. Respondents in brain imaging studies showed significantly less empathy if the person they observe experiencing pain belongs to a different race , social class or an opposing football team or political party. \nThird, empathizing with an individual can lead us to be unreasonably cruel to others. In one study , participants were told about a poor student who was competing to win a cash prize. Participants subsequently administered a greater dose of hot sauce to her competitor, although this person had done nothing wrong. The relationship between empathy and aggression has been manipulated on numerous occasions by politicians who ask us to empathise with the stories of victims in order to gain public support for invasion . \nBloom presents a number of other arguments against empathy as a reliable motivator for moral behavior. He acknowledges that it can be a good thing: it leads to greater enjoyment of art, fiction and sports, can be a valuable aspect of intimate relationships and can motivate generous behaviour. What he refutes is the widespread notion that more empathy is all that is required in order for us to become good and moral people. \nInstead, he argues that reasoned compassion, utilitarian cost-benefit calculations and sticking to moral principles are much fairer and more reliable guides to moral behavior. Compassion and empathy may seem to be inextricably intertwined but imaging studies reveal that they activate different areas of the brain. Furthermore, in these studies empathy training frequently led to empathetic distress, a precursor to emotional burnout, inactivity and lack of engagement with those in distress. Compassion training, by contrast, not only predicted moral behaviour on subsequent tasks but also boosted resilience which in turn fostered better coping in stressful situations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T16:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T11:13:00.537+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
