Joanie had just been released from prison (Photo: ITV) \nJust before the incident, Joanie had discovered Lisa and Zak’s renewed romance, which had baffled her after all Zak had put Lisa through in the past. \nShe’d also just found out Zak had issued a legal letter to her while she was in prison, seeking to end their marriage. \nAfter breaking the news about Zak to Joanie, Lisa had said: “I’m still not sure I can trust him but I wasn’t the one who broke up our marriage. I was perfectly happy the way things were.” Lisa had just told Joanie about her and Zak (Photo: ITV) \n“Until you found out he was cheating,” retorted Joanie. \n“Yes,” said Lisa. \n“But despite that you still feel you belong together? Well good luck to you Lisa, you’re a better woman than I am if you can forgive and forget.” \n“As I said, it’s not easy and the truth of it is I don’t know if we’ll ever get there,” admitted Lisa. \n“We are trying, we both are,” added Lisa, “but it’s hard when he takes one step forward and two steps back.” Lisa was referring to Zak sending the legal letter to Joanie. \nJoanie replied: “This is all about him. He believes he has the right to be happy no matter who he has to lie to. I don’t know what I ever saw in him, I truly don’t. I’m sorry I stole him from you.” \n“Likewise,” replied Lisa, who then added: “I didn’t steal him. I never gave him any encouragement. He just wore down my defences.” \n”That’s hardly the hardly the romantic statement of the century,” said Joanie, “you can still change your mind.” \nAnd it seems like Lisa was thinking just that as, just before Joanie died, she said: “I’m going to tell him it’s not working, we gave it a shot but can’t go backwards.” \nLisa had been talking to Joanie when she looked over and saw her dead in the passenger seat of the car. \nWe didn't see anything else on screen - the next thing that happened was Lisa breaking the news to Zak, saying: “I don’t know how to tell you this, but Joanie’s died. I collected her from prison like we planned, we were talking, it was fine, then she keeled over.\" \n\"I called an ambulance, they tried to resuscitate her but she had gone.\" \nZak and Lisa then broke the news to the extended family, saying she'd collapsed on the way home from prison. \n*Emmerdale continues tomorrow at 7pm on ITV Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T03:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:00:40.983+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
