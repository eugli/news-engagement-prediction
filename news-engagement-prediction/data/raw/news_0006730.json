Almost half of British women say they are not getting enough sleep and don't feel well-rested when they wake-up \nB ut while sleep deprivation decreased women’s enjoyment of sex, it did not decrease the frequency they had sex with a partner. Fifty-six per cent of the women surveyed reported being “somewhat” or “very” satisfied with their current sexual activity, while overall 52 per cent reported partnered sexual activity within the last 12 months. \nIt's further proof that a good night's sleep can work wonders for women. Last July, researchers from the Max Planck Institute in Munich, found that sleep can boost women's intelligence . \nProblem is, many of us struggle to get any decent shut eye. According to a study from January 2016, almost half of British women say they are not getting enough sleep and don't feel well-rested when they wake-up. \nThe Reclaim Your Sleep survey found that women are more likely than men to have trouble sleeping, wake up during the night and have trouble getting back to sleep. While Public Health England has said that insomnia particularly affects the over 40s . The study found a relationship between sleep quality and length, and sexual satisfaction \nO ne in three Brits suffers from poor quality sleep - with stress, computers and taking work home often blamed. Regular poor sleep increases the risk of serious medical conditions including obesity, heart disease and diabetes - and shortens life expectancy. \nAll in all, it seems we need to bed down better. Here are some tips to help you drift off ... Tips to get a good night's sleep - and boost your sex life \nEstablish your sleep goal We all need varying and unique amounts of sleep (usually between six and nine hours a night, as a general guide) but it’s important to figure out what’s right for you as an individual - and makes you feel at your best. Note down how much sleep you get and how you feel in the morning to pinpoint your optimum rest period. \nSet a routine Go to bed at roughly the same time every day, even at weekends. Lie-ins might be one of life's pleasures but they make it harder to get to sleep the next night, setting you up for a troubled week. \nDon’t eat before bed Try not to eat a large meal within three hours of your bedtime, as your digestive system will be working overtime, disrupting your sleep. On the other hand, don't go to bed hungry. If you're prone to the midnight munchies, have a small snack before bed with slow releasing energy, such as walnuts or a banana to keep hunger pangs at bay. Turkey, warm milk, honey, camomile and Marmite are also good options. \nBe careful what you drink Caffeine and alcohol can affect your quality of sleep. Our metabolic rate slows as we age and an afternoon coffee could be keeping us awake as late as 10pm. Similarly, a glass of wine might send us off to sleep quickly (and make us feel amorous), but the quality will be poor. \nSwitch off Avoid screens late at night, especially laptops and tablets. The bright, close light tricks your brain into thinking it is earlier in the day. \nRelax Perhaps easier said than done – but try to avoid stressful situations in the lead up to bedtime. Establish a calming routine (herbal tea, hot bath, gentle exercise) and stay away from confrontational phone calls, technology, horror movies or paying bills. Create the right atmosphere Make sure your bedroom is at the right temperature (not too warm), dark and that your bed, bedding and pillow is comfortable . This will promote the production of melatonin, a sleep-inducing hormone triggered by darkness. \nHydrate Keep drinking water. Dehydration is the primary cause of 'shallow' sleep, so while you don't want to wake up needing the loo, take on enough fluids to stop yourself waking up thirsty. \nSee a GP If you have any concerns about your sleep, see your GP and don’t suffer in silence.
