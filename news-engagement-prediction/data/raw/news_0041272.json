Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Wheel has raised a total of $3.2 million in VC funding to date, according to Pitchbook. \nIn an interview with Business Insider, Boukadakis said that discussions with Tinder began a few months ago when he showed the Wheel app to Tinder chairman Sean Rad . \n\"What we were doing with content was all about connecting a young demographic around creating content together,\" he said. \"There was a lot of synergy with what we were doing and what they were doing.\" \nBoukadakis, who will be Tinder's VP of Special Initiatives, said that Wheel was designed to “lower the barrier for entry to content creation” and \"make connecting more comfortable.\" \nArnold Schwarzenegger surprised high school beta users of Wheel by joining their video story last year.
