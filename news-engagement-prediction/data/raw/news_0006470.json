PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 00:01, Wed, Feb 1, 2017 PA/GETTY Remoaners have been warned any attempt to block Brexit would be political suicide \nThe threat provoked a stark warning from Tory veteran MP Sir Bill Cash that Remoaners “will be committing political suicide” if they stop Brexit as he claimed they “do not get the scale of what this revolution involves”. \nFormer cabinet minister Owen Paterson added that there will be “shattering, catastrophic damage to the integrity of the political establishment if this (Brexit) is not delivered.\" \nThe Remoaner plot was revealed as MPs yesterday began a two-day debate on the 137-word European Union (notification of withdrawal) Bill which needs to be passed to allow the Government to trigger the article 50 withdrawal process. Related articles Donald Trump using Britain as 'Trojan Horse' to DESTROY the EU \nA cabal of leading Tory Remoaners including former ministers Anna Soubry and Dominic Grieve made it clear that they hope to force the government to hold a “meaningful vote” at the end of the process. \nThe plot which was supported by Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer and fits in with the Lib Dem plan to have a rerun of the referendum would give MPs the chance to stop Brexit at the end of the negotiations. \nWhile Ms Soubry, Mr Grieve and Sir Keir all said they would support passing the bill to trigger Article 50 they also made it clear that they could support an amendment in the later stages of the bill allowing MPs to reverse Brexit if MPs do not like the final EU deal. GETTY The Prime Minister has made it clear that no Brexit deal is better than a bad one \nA Downing Street spokeswoman for the Prime Minister dismissed the threat and pointed out that the Prime Minister has made it clear “no deal is better than a bad deal”. They are pretty late coming to the democratic party Michael Gove \nIn an emotional speech, Ms Soubry declared that “all options should remain open” at the end of the negotiation indicating that she wants MPs to have the chance to overturn the historic result or run a second referendum. \nUnderlining her commitment to keep Britain under Brussels rule, she said generations to come would not forgive people who have chosen \"not to be true to their long-held views, who have remained mute as our country has turned its back on the benefits of the free movement of people, the single market and the customs union\". \nMr Grieve described the decision by the British people as “an error” and backed the idea of an amendment that mandates a Commons vote on the final deal. \nStroud Tory MP Neil Carmichael said that the Government needs to “keep its options open” and suggested he would press for Britain to have “associate membership” of the EU. \nEarlier, Sir Keir told up to 80 Labour MPs planning to oppose the bill and block Article 50 that they are supposed to be “democrats” and should not oppose the Government. \nHe said: “I wish the result had gone the other way—I campaigned passionately for that—but as democrats we in the Labour party have to accept the result. It follows that the Prime Minister should not be blocked from starting the article 50 negotiations.” \nHowever, significantly, he added that he believes MPs should be allowed to stop Britain Leaving. GETTY Anna Soubry has suggested she would like the option to overturn the Brexit vote \nHe told Ms Soubry: “It is to ensure that this place has a meaningful role that Labour has tabled these amendment, in relation to the final vote, to ensure that the issue comes here first, rather than later.” \nBut former justice secretary Michael Gove , who led the Vote Leave campaign, mocked the Remoaners who are now arguing for the sovereignty of parliament. \nHe asked where they had been “from 1972 until now when thousands and thousands of laws have been forced on the British people” from the EU without being taken through parliament. \n“They are pretty late coming to the democratic party,” he said. Government Loses Brexit Vote Appeal Tue, January 24, 2017 Britain's most senior judges ruled that Prime Minister Theresa May does not have the power to trigger the formal process Article 50 for the UK's exit from the European Union without Parliament having a say. PA 1 of 12 Issued by the Supreme Court of (top row, from the left) Lord Neuberger, Lord Mance, Lord Kerr, Lord Sumption, (bottom row, from the left) Lady Hale, Lord Clarke, Lord Wilson and Lord Hodge, who agreed with the majority decision that the Government could not trigger Article 50 without Parliamentary approval. \nHe also accused the plotters of attempting to “obfuscate, delay and dilute the democratic mandate of the British people.” \nEarlier, Brexit Secretary David Davis had told MPs that they need “to trust the people” and reminded them that by six to one they had voted to give the decision to the British people in a referendum. \nIn an impassioned speech, he warned that the country will not accept brexit being blocked or overturned. \nHe said: “The eyes of the nation are on this Chamber as we consider the Bill. For many years, there has been a creeping sense in the country—and not just in this country—that politicians say one thing and then do another. \n“We voted to give the people the chance to determine our future in a referendum. Now we must honour our side of the agreement: to vote to deliver on the result.” \nIn a significant intervention former minister and constitutional expert Oliver Letwin said it was the “solemn duty” of MPs to vote for the bill and accept the referendum result and state that it is irreversible. \nHowever the case was summed up in an eight second speech by Tory defence select committee chairman Dr Julian Lewis. \nHe said: \"In my opinion, the people have decided and I'm going to vote accordingly.\" \nMeanwhile veteran Tory former cabinet minister Ken Clarke said he would vote for a Scottish Nationalists amendment todayWEDS that will stop the bill and prevent Article 50 being triggered. \nIn a rambling speech he likened Brexit to Alice in Wonderland and suggested that trade deals could be done with the Mad Hatter. GETTY Michael Gove dismissed remoaners who are just now asking for sovereignty \nThe unrepentant Europhile who campaigned for Britain to join the disastrous single currency claimed he had no need to accept the democratic will of the British people. \nHe said: “I personally shall be voting with my conscience content, and when we see what unfolds hereafter as we leave the European Union, I hope that the consciences of other Members of Parliament will remain equally content.” \nMPs will vote todayWEDS to allow the bill to proceed before it goes to later stages in the Commons and Lords.Tory MP Jacob Rees Mogg accused Remoaner MPs of \"monstrous hypocrisy\" saying that they \"cry parliamentary sovereignty to obstruct the will of the British people\" but had \"no interest\" in defending it when power was being dragged away from Britain to Brussels. \nTory MP Jacob Rees Mogg accused Remoaner MPs of \"monstrous hypocrisy\" saying that they \"cry parliamentary sovereignty to obstruct the will of the British people\" but had \"no interest\" in defending it when power was being dragged away from Britain to Brussels.
