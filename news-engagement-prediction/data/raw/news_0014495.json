Jarrod Singh showed off his slick steps after the fight he was called out to police in downtown Oshawa on Sunday night turned out to be a group of University of Ontario Institute of Technology students shooting a music video. “ I saw eight people gathered around one person , so I can see how a member of the public thought it was a fight,” Singh, a constable with the Durham Regional Police Service, said in a statement. “ But when I got closer I could see he was break dancing in the middle and there was someone filming it.” With the cameras still rolling, Singh freestyle battled one of the dancers, 23-year-old Mahdi Tarfi . Watch the full video here: “ I was like, OK, this guy can move ,” Tarfi told ABC News. “He finished and was going to leave and I said, ‘No man, it’s not that easy,’ and asked him to do another dance with me.” Vivid Media Co ., a Toronto-based design company, was recording the students’ video for an upcoming dance competition when Singh danced his way into the shot. The company shared the footage of the impromptu dance-off to Facebook on Thursday. It’s since garnered more than 1 million views. While Singh’s moves have wowed people online, he’s no stranger to boogying down. According to the police statement, he was a member of a Durham College dance troupe that once opened a show for rapper Rick Ross .
