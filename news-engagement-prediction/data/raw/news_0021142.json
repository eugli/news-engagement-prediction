The song has received positive reviews from fans and followers. One thing that many are loving about this revisited version or ‘tribute’, as Varun and Alia like to call it is the fact that it retained the voices of original singers; Bappi Lahiri and Anuradha Paudwal. Also the hook step and the hook tune of Tamma Tamma Loge is still afresh in people’s mind that helped the song become an instant hit among the fans even today.

For all those who wondered why Tamma Tamma Loge from Thanedaar and Jumma Chumma De De from Hum sounded similar? Well that’s becasue both the songs were a copy of this french track by Mori Kanté. The track was an instant hit upon its release. The hook line of the song Tam Tama lobe was lifted and turned into Tamma Tamma Loge. And that’s why the words Tamma Tamma Loge doesn’t make sense. Looks like Bappi Lahiri got little too much inspired.
