In fact, I was an adult the first time I had duck prepared for me. It just wasn’t something we ate in my household growing up. \nNow, I kind of know why because I can’t picture my mom being cool with this horrifying discovery this young woman made. Tiarra Duncan \nTiarra Duncan is 21-years-old and she just wanted to make orange ginger-braised duck for dinner. Instead, she basically wrote the plot to the next season of “ American Horror Story .” \nShe told BuzzFeed News the meat was labeled “frozen duck” at the store. She said, \nI was expecting it to look like how a whole chicken or turkey does when you buy it. No head, no feet. \nThis is also what I would expect. Instead, this poor young woman, got this… Tiarra Duncan \nI would love to know how long in between these snaps Duncan spent screaming because this Snapchat has me rolling. \nIMAGINE this duck’s smug-ass face slowly slopping out of that plastic bag, thumping on the sink like, “OH HEY THERE.” \nI WOULD SCREAM, TOO. “Y’all trying to get ya duck on?” Tiarra Duncan “What do you mean, you lost ya appetite?” Tiarra Duncan \nNeedless to say, the post made a lot of vegans on Twitter angry. \nDuncan said she found someone else to trim the duck, and she still ate it. She admits it was “hard to look at after that.” \nShe said, \nI don’t think I’ll be able to look at meat the same again. \nThis is exactly what the ducks want you to do. They sacrificed one to save many. Soon, they will rule the world. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T09:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:40:49.302+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
