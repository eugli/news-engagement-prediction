One show, stretching across what seemed like an endless amount of hours, brought us great joy – in the form of Beyoncé leaning backward in a chair and Bruno Mars strutting onstage in a purple suit – as well as a more than a few let-downs, mixed with some genuine confusion. No awards show, especially one honoring music, should have as many technical difficulties as we (and James Hetfield) had to endure Sunday night. And as much fun as James Corden is while he’s carpooling with the stars, his “who, me?” schtick struggled to fill a room as big as Staples Center. Now that it’s behind us, let’s break down what worked, what didn’t, and what was just baffling.\nHIGH: David Bowie sweeping. \nOver the course of his entire lifetime, Bowie won just a single Grammy for a music video (and not even Ziggy Stardust); tonight he won five posthumous awards , picking up his first-ever Grammy for recognition of his music and finally getting the sweep he’d so long been denied.\nLOW: Our general boredom. \nAn hours-long awards show shouldn’t be filled with a bunch of down-tempo performances, especially when they all seemed to fill up the first half. The Grammys have the most live-entertainment firepower available to them of all the awards shows. If they can’t translate that into an engaging start-to-finish production, it’s time to change some things.\nRELATED LOW: Ed Sheeran’s endless performance of his nondescript new single. \nCase in point.\nHIGH: Beyoncé hypnotizing everyone. \nWords won’t do what Beyoncé did justice, so we submit:\nLOW: Lemonade only won two awards. \nAdding insult to injury, Beyoncé even lost to Ron Howard’s Beatles documentary for Best Music Film. Dark times, indeed.\nWHOA: Adele dedicating her Album of the Year to Beyonce . Because when Kanye’s M.I.A., someone’s gotta do the honors.\nHIGH: Blue Ivy everything. \nBlue Ivy stopped by your little awards show to cheer on her mom. In between entertaining an audience with Nick Jonas , and salvaging James Corden’s “Sweet Caroline” bit, the eldest Carter progeny reminded us that she was Destiny’s original Child.\nHIGH: Wondering, briefly, if Corden getting stuck wasn’t a gag. \nIn retrospect, Corden’s bumbled-monologue bit foreshadowed a night full of technical difficulties and flubs. But when the show started, the possibility of Corden’s adorable ineptitude being genuine felt like a welcome breath of a reality.\nWHOA: Corden’s Carpool Karaoke segment. \nWe knew no Corden-hosted event would be complete without a segment paying homage to The Late Late Show host’s most popular bit, but we didn’t expect the only reference to Carpool Karaoke to be so haphazard and disappointing. After wheeling his cardboard cut-out of a car down the aisles of the Staples Center, Corden halfheartedly invited everyone from Jennifer Lopez to Faith Hill to join him in singing “Sweet Caroline.” And it may have worked, if anyone in the group other than Corden and Neil Diamond himself knew the lyrics.\nLOW: The AV Team. \nThe tech team inadvertently neutered one of the show’s few high energy performances to that point by having a non-working microphone for James Hetfield during Metallica’s collabo with Lady Gaga. Enter Soundman, more like.\nHIGH: Rihanna’s flask won for best flask. \nRihanna, apparently the smartest attendee, brought a glittery flask. These award shows tend to go long, and Ri came prepared. We’re guessing she removed the cap the moment she saw Corden fake-fall down a flight of stairs.\nLOW: Lukas Graham and Kelsea Ballerini’s performance.\nWho feat. WHO? Did you know (we didn’t) that Lukas Graham isn’t the name of a person, but rather the name of a band? They sang the hit “7 years,” possibly referencing the length of Ed Sheeran’s performance.\nOk, now time for all of us to Google Kelsea.\nHIGH: A Tribe Called Quest’s message to resist. \nYou can channel Hillary Clinton and shout boilerplate messages of peace , or you can call the president “agent orange” and raise the black power fist in a rallying cry for resistance. A Tribe Called Quest and Anderson .Paak went with the latter for their Grammy performance and it paid off: it’s the rare moment from tonight’s marathon you’ll still remember tomorrow morning.\nLOW: Pentatonix. \nAfter winning a Grammy for Best Country Duo/Group Performance (sure) for their cover of “Jolene” with Dolly Parton, the a cappella group came on late in the night to perform a tribute to the Jackson 5. At some point, you just have to draw the line.\nWHOA: Adele re-starting her George Michael tribute. \nThe last time Adele graced the Grammys with her presence, they dropped a guitar on a piano mid-performance and spoiled her whole night. She came back this year for redemption and wound up self-sabotaging her own tribute to George Michael . Suffering from a case of the feels, Adele got choked up, started off in the wrong key, and in a move that violates every Grammy code, said sod it (except she actually cursed), and demanded a do-over. Tears and all.\nNaturally, she then killed it.\nHIGH: Chance the Rapper’s wins . \nThe Grammys as an awards show may be antiquated (there’s a reason you dozed off on anything not Beyonce), but in some ways, its awards are catching up. Adele is still the Grammy queen, but Chance the Rapper – the first artist to ever be nominated for a streaming-only album – pulling off the upset to win Best Rap Album over Drake is a sign the Grammys are listening. (He also rightfully won Best New Artist.) This may be the first and only year SoundCloud gets a shout out on the Grammys stage, but Chance will be immortalized as the vanguard .\nWHOA: Katy Perry’s baffling red carpet interview . \nKaty Perry, clad in a disastrous Tom Ford medley, told Ryan Seacrest about how her new single “Chained to the Rhythm” has “layers” and uttered an expletive far too strong for E!’s censors. New, woke Katy’s a real adventure, everybody.\nHIGH: Bruno Mars’s eyeliner. I mean…. \nLOW: All the commercials for Carly Rae Jepsen’s commercial. This is not the place to discuss the merits of Carly and Lil Yatchy’s “It Takes Two” Target commercial – whatever, it was fun! This is the place where we complain about all the commercials for that commercial that aired throughout the first few hours of the show. We were one shot of red shopping cart away from losing it.\nLOW: Leaving Cynthia Erivo and The Color Purple’s win out of the televised ceremony. \nOf course the Grammys put Hamilton on full display last year , but oddly didn’t have time for musical theater this time around. And why’d we get so little of Erivo and John Legend as they performed their in memoriam tribute? We demand an Erivo-Legend movie musical in compensation for such a slight.\nWHOA: John Travolta can’t see. \nApparently “going clear” has no effect on eyesight. Travolta couldn’t read the teleprompter, so he whipped out some index cards instead. But it really makes you wonder, why doesn’t he have glasses? Is he just worried about looking like a nerd? It’s cool Travolta, you couldn’t look like a nerd if you tried. (Actually, the necklace things were a bit much.)\nLOW: 21 Pilots took off their pants. \nAfter winning Pop Duo or Group Performance, the group stripped down to their boxer briefs. They had a vaguely endearing story about how they were honoring their memories of watching the Grammys in their underwear. But really, some memories are best kept under wraps.\nTags: vulture homepage lede grammys 2017 music beyonce bruno mars james corden awards tv rihanna vulture lists More The Highs, Lows, and Whoas of the 2017 Grammys   Most Popular Video On Vulture The Best Bloopers From Friends   2 mins ago  \n13 mins ago The  \nYesterday at 10:30 p.m. Why Girls Is So Good When It Leaves New York City Outside, everything is clearer, simpler, more candid.\nYesterday at 10:28 p.m. Katy Perry Pays Homage to Hillary Clinton, Elizabeth Warren at 2017 Grammys She wore an armband that said, simply, “Persist.”\nYesterday at 10:13 p.m. The Walking Dead Recap: Turn That Frown Upside Down “Rock in the Road” has one of the show’s greatest zombie slaughter scenes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T08:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T09:09:32.539+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
