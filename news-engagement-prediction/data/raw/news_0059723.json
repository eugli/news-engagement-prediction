CLARY/AFP/Getty Images) \nEven with at least 20 news cameras pointed at his podium, it seemed Yiannopoulos' options as a media figure were quickly running out. \nWith the solemnity of a White House press secretary announcing a national tragedy, Yiannopoulos began reading from a prepared statement. \n\"I am a gay man and a child abuse victim. Between the ages of 13 and 16, two men touched me in ways they should not have. One of those men was a priest,\" he said. \nFor this occasion, Yiannopoulos' formality was appropriate. \nOver the weekend, two freewheeling video interviews — one from 2015 with comedian Joe Rogan; the other dating back to at least July 2016 — regained traction on the internet. \nYiannopoulos had recounted being an underage victim at the hands of adult sexual offenders. But while dissecting pedophilia during those interviews, Yiannopoulos neglected to flat-out condemn his abusers, which swiftly inspired the loss of the book contract. \nThat same day, the 2017 Conservative Political Action Conference disinvited Yiannopoulos as its keynote speaker. \nHowever, during Tuesday's press conference, Yiannopoulos announced that other publishers have already expressed interest in finding a home for his Dangerous book. \nBut things had dramatically shifted since the previous Friday evening, when Yiannopoulos appeared on the HBO talk show Real Time with Bill Maher . \nOn Tuesday, Yiannopoulos was decked out in a blue suit with a red tie. To sit across from Maher, he chose a pearlescent necklace with a matching bracelet. \nDuring the Tuesday press conference, Yiannopoulos apologized. And for a verbal provocateur and self-identified free-speech advocate who's been permanently banned from Twitter, that clarification is actually newsworthy. \n\"I am certainly guilty of imprecise language, which I regret,\" he said. \"But for those statements I did make where I misspoke, I do apologize. \n\"I've never apologized for anything else before. I don't anticipate doing it again. But this particular subject strikes pretty close to home,\" he continued. \nWhile the press conference was held on the 11th floor of an office building, the chants of anti-Yiannopoulos protesters from the sidewalk below could be heard as he took questions from reporters. \n\"The book will come out this year as planned — with perhaps an additional chapter. I'll be donating 10 percent of my royalties to child sex abuse charities,\" Yiannopoulos said. \nThe decision to drop Dangerous comes at a high price. According to The New York Times , Yiannopoulos received a $250,000 advance . \nHis literary agent, Thomas Flannery Jr., says the title was nearing 50,000 copies in advance sales. \nEditor's note : Daniel Kusner is a freelance writer based in Dallas and New York View Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T12:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T09:01:05.699+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
