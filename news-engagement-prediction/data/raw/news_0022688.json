The collective agreement, which began in 2010, expired about two weeks later and the union began striking Jan. 12.\n“The company never did put a formalized offer for us to present to our membership,” said Folk. “I have indicated, almost on a daily basis, that we are willing to come back to the table at any time. The company’s response is ‘give us a time, give us a place, but when you come back, be more creative in what you want to offer us.’ ”\nThompson declined to comment on the specifics of the negotiations for “confidentiality reasons.” But he said a formal offer was tabled before talks came to a standstill.\n“The offer’s been open since the negotiations broke off,” Thompson said. “We’re still at an impasse and right now on our side, our priority is getting everybody back to the table so we can continue negotiating a deal and get everybody back to work to brewing great beer.”\nShould the strike end up being a prolonged one, the company is “ready on all fronts,” said Thompson. He would not rule out replacement workers, but added “that’s not ideal.”\n“The contingency plan is evolving as we speak,” Thompson said. “We had a short-term solution in place and now we continue to look at ‘what if.’ We’ve addressed pretty much every ‘what if’ scenario right now.”\nUnlike the month-long lockout in 1985 of 3,500 workers at the three major breweries — Molson, Labatt’s and Carling O’Keefe — there won’t be a province-wide dry spell anytime soon even if Molson Coors’ distribution eventually takes a hit.\n“Back then, they controlled so much of the volume and the distribution, but that’s just not the case today,” said analyst Robert Carter, executive director of food service at NPD Group. \n“The portfolio of options is just so much more broader, the distribution channels so much bigger that we won’t experience something like what we did in the 1980s.”\nHe said he doubted the strike would have a major impact on the company’s sales. \n“The challenge for someone like a Molson is they’re losing market share on a regular basis to these smaller craft breweries so any negative press is a concern for them overall,” Carter said.\nFolk says he sees “no end in sight” to the strike.\n“It’s been a great job, a proud job. I’ve always been proud to be an employee of Molson and it’s a very sad day,” said Folk, who’s worked as a brewery worker for nearly 35 years.\n“If they bring in replacement workers, I might not ever drink a Molson product again.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T04:18:50.644+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
