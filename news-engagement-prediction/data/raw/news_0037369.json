Rec Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY Sports After missing out on reaching the mark on Tuesday, Sidney Crosby would not be denied again as the Penguins’ captain has hit 1,000 points on Thursday. The point came on an assist during Pittsburgh’s home game against the Winnipeg Jets. Crosby fought the puck away from a Jets’ player before swinging it over to Chris Kunitz for the goal. — nope (@myregularface) February 17, 2017 Hockey fans have been blessed to see both Crosby and Alex Ovechkin hit the 1,000 point mark this season, with Ovechkin reaching the mark one month ago . Crosby, however, has done it in less games due to various injuries, with Thursday’s being his 757th regular season game. Crosby is now the 12th fastest player to hit 1,000 points and the fastest active player to hit the mark. Like most of his points throughout his career, No. 1000 came on an assist. Crosby may not be as prolific a scorer as Ovechkin, but he’s the ultimate set up man and playmaker as his passing is almost second to none in the NHL.
