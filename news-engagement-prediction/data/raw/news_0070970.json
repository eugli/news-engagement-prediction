His death didn’t become known until the next day. \nAs Kotaku has reported, detectives from the Virgina Beach police department are investigating the incident. \nPoshybrid had 7852 subscribers on Twitch , and regularly hosted long streams on little sleep. \nThis is a strong reminder of the importance of employing safe practices if you’re a streamer – try to avoid sleep deprivation, keep hydrated, and don’t be afraid to pull the plug on a stream if necessary. \nOur thoughts are with his friends, family, and fans.
