Stop-and-frisk by New York City police was halted after a federal court ruled it was unconstitutional in 2013. \nIn Milwaukee, the ACLU is seeking a court order to end the practice there, citing studies and officer testimony that said police conduct overly aggressive stop-and-frisk patrols in largely black and Latino neighborhoods, encouraged by quota systems that require a certain number of stops per day. \nTrump, a Republican, repeatedly endorsed stop-and-frisk during his 2016 election campaign and civil rights advocates are concerned that his administration will dismantle policing reforms pursued by Democratic President Barack Obama. \n“This work is even more important now when it doesn’t appear that similar reforms will come from the Justice Department,” said ACLU attorney Nusrat Choudhury. \nDarius Charney, a Center for Constitutional Rights attorney who brought the case in New York, said he expects civil society groups to start intervening in Obama-era police reform agreements if Trump’s Justice Department stops aggressively enforcing them. \nTrump’s main anti-crime action has been an executive order directing the U.S. Attorney General to establish a task force on crime reduction and public safety. \nIn Milwaukee, violent crime per capita was higher in 2015 than in 2007, according to FBI data, even though the Milwaukee police made nearly three times more traffic and pedestrian stops in 2015. \nTracy Grant, a plaintiff in the Milwaukee suit, said her 17-year-old son has been stopped and searched by police officers for no clear reason several times while walking through his neighborhood, beginning when he was 11. \nWhen the ACLU called, Grant said, her son asked her to join the case on his behalf: “He said we can’t just sit back and wait for other people to do something.” \n(Reporting by Julia Harte; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Grant McCool) Do you have information you want to share with the Huffington Post?

The 37-year-old died after her mother called 911 while Anderson was having a \" mental health episode ,\" as described in the family's subsequent lawsuit against city police. Officials say that when officers tried to take Anderson to a treatment facility, she struggled and then went limp. Her family says police slammed her to the ground and put a knee in her back. A medical examiner ruled Anderson’s death a homicide, the result of being \" physically restrained in a prone position by Cleveland police .\" Her heart condition and bipolar disorder were also considered factors.The Cuyahoga County Sheriff's Department began investigating the incident in July at the request of the prosecutor’s office. In a wrongful death lawsuit, Anderson's family alleges that CPD Officers Scott Aldridge and Bryan Myers did not provide medical attention to Anderson as she lay on the ground unconscious.Aldridge had previously been suspended for violating the department's use-of-force policies, according to Northeast Ohio Media Group, and was disciplined in 2012 for his role in the deaths of Malissa Williams and Timothy Russell (see slide #6 in this collection). Aldridge and Myers deny that they caused Anderson’s death and have asked for the case to be dismissed .The month after Anderson was killed, an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice concluded that Cleveland police have a pattern of using excessive force , including against people who are mentally ill, and that they don’t use appropriate techniques to account for mental illness.Mauvion Green, Anderson’s daughter, told Northeast Ohio Media Group last year that she wants to work for conscientious treatment of people with mental illnesses . \"I'm fighting for my mother, but I'm fighting for everyone else, too,\" Green said.
