(CBC)\n\nBut while there are similarities, in one important way this season has been very different, at least so far.\nSee an interactive chart comparing Charlottetown snowfalls here \nBoth seasons got off to an early start and had a long lull in January.\n\nOn Feb. 1, this winter and the record-breaking winter had the same amount of total snowfall. Since Feb. 1 there have been two significant snowfalls with a total of 39 centimetres down this month. The current snowfall could double that.\n\nThe first 13 days of 2015 also saw two significant snowfalls, but they brought a total of 108 centimetres.\n\nBut what about Thursday? \nWe don't know yet what's going to come down this week, with one storm underway and one possible for Thursday.\n\nBut we do know that in 2015, a storm on Feb. 15-16 left behind 86.8 centimetres of snow at Charlottetown Airport, in what may be the biggest single snowstorm in P.E.I. history. White Juan — the storm from the winter of 2004 — dropped only 74.4 centimetres.\n\nYes, we're getting a lot of storms, but they were a lot bigger two years ago. To catch up with 2015 this week, Charlottetown Airport would need to record 147 centimetres of snow.\n\nLet's hope Mother Nature doesn't take that as a challenge.\nMORE P.E.I.
