Ford is building a rolling road aerodynamic tunnel with a series of conveyor belts that will move under vehicles of every size and description—making it more realistic by essentially bringing the road to the vehicle. \"As the technology on our vehicles has been advancing, we need the capability of moving-ground simulation to validate design,\" Shuk said.\n© Motor Trend Staff 2017-Ford-GT-front-three-quarters-1 Each vehicle will be put on a dyno with a moving belt under each of the four wheels and a fifth large moving belt under the center of the vehicle to get proper airflow underneath it. The tunnel will be able to test vehicles at simulated speeds of up to 155 mph with all the belts in motion. Or engineers can turn off all but the big strip of conveyor and unleash 200-mph winds—something Ford didn't really need before it created the GT and returned to racing. Having won the 2016 Le Mans 24 Hours , the team wants to add to the trophy case.\n\"This new wind tunnel facility will not only allow us to test our performance and racing vehicle lineup but will also enable us to share innovations across all our global Ford products,\" said Dave Pericak, Ford Performance global director.\nAfter a couple years of operation, phase two will add an advanced climate chamber that can dip to temperatures as low as -40 degrees Fahrenheit or as high as 140 degrees, said Shuk. Ford is still working on the specs for that portion of the complex.\n© Motor Trend Staff 2017 Ford GT rear end in motion Ford is not first to invest in the latest in aerodynamic testing but neither is it the last. More accurate data, efficiency, and repeatability that can be applied to product development makes it a prudent investment, Shuk said. It will help with design, fuel efficiency and the ability to meet future legislative regulations.\nExisting wind tunnels and climate chambers remain in place for the foreseeable future and there are no plans to retrofit them.\nThe new testing complex is not part of the larger plan to update Ford's many facilities in Dearborn.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.motortrend.com/news/2017-ford-gt-makes-647-hp-550-lb-ft-goes-216-mph/", "http://www.motortrend.com/news/ford-gt-takes-first-third-fourth-24-hours-le-mans/", "http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/gt/2017/2017-ford-gt-first-ride/", "http://www.motortrend.com/", "http://www.motortrend.com/news/fords-has-portable-wind-tunnel-to-test-new-vehicles-at-plant/"], "published": "2017-02-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T06:08:09.178+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
