This was exacerbated by delays in the arrival of additional aircraft to handle the heavy passenger traffic during the holiday season. \nCustomers headed to the North Coast destinations of Lamu and South Coast destinations of Diani and Ukunda were especially affected. \nSome passengers found themselves diverted to the Moi International Airport and were forced to make the rest of their journeys by road. \nSLAMMED \nHoteliers facing revenue loss in a peak period for domestic tourism slammed Jambojet for its handling of the situation. The Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA) said in a December 30, 2016 letter that it would also look into the matter. \nJust before the holiday season, Jambojet had increased flight frequency on all its destinations to take advantage of the travel rush. \nJambojet last month ordered new aircraft to meet rising demand and to avoid a repeat of the December crisis. The airline received a Bombardier Dash 8 Q400, replacing an older, less efficient plane on its fleet. \nThe aircraft is on lease for a year and Jambojet has said that it plans to expand its fleet by one more plane come August 2017. Jambojet operates a fleet of two Q400s and two Boeing 737s. \nThe budget airline serves six routes— Mombasa, Eldoret, Kisumu, Ukunda, Lamu and Diani. The firm is seeking regulatory approval to fly to Entebbe, Mogadishu, Juba and Dar es Salaam.
