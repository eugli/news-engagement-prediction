A spokeswoman from Virgin Atlantic said the man was handed over to the authorities upon arrival into Lajes. Mr Haagman said that passengers were told they could stay on board the plane, but were later asked to disembark as the flight was delayed for four hours. Pictured: letter from Virgin Atlantic apologising for the incident. Alfie Haagman said that Virgin handled the incident very professionally The VS097, from London Gatwick to St Lucia, on Saturday, January 28 was diverted to Lajes in the Azores in order to remove a disruptive customer They were eventually able to get back in the air and Mr Haagman said that Virgin were 'really good' in the way they handled the incident. The spokeswoman added: 'The VS097, from London Gatwick to St Lucia, on Saturday, January 28 was diverted to Lajes in the Azores in order to remove a disruptive customer. 'The safety and security of customers and crew is always our priority and we will not tolerate abusive or threatening behaviour on board our aircraft. 'We always want our customers to have the best experience when they fly with us, and while very rare, it is disappointing when a disruptive individual impacts that experience for other customers.' In a letter issued to passengers affected by the incident, Virgin wrote that a customer aboard the flight began behaving in 'an aggressive and disruptive manner.' They added: 'Our crew are trained to handle and diffuse such situations and made every possible effort to manage this. 'Safety is always our absolute priority, and as the continued behaviour of this individual posed a potential risk to himself and others, we had no choice but to divert and remove the disruptive customer.'
