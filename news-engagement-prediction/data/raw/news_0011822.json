Where there are genuine issues of the ANC Youth League in Gauteng to be engaged with the leadership of the ANC in Gauteng, the ANC calls for the Youth League to raise these within acceptable organisational and societal norms,\" the statement read. \nIt called for the national youth league and the Gauteng ANC to \"strongly reprimand\" the Gauteng ANCYL for their \"inhumane behaviour\". \nThe league later backtracked and withdrew the charges. \nFollowing her appointment in June last year, the party said Sangoni was a longs tanding member who had worked in various roles and structures within the party, its youth league and women’s league. \nShe was also a member of the ANC Gauteng Provincial Executive Committee. \nZuma, who at 25 became the youngest chief of staff in the ministry, on Friday tweeted that spokesperson \"must be an elected NEC member, not an employee\". \n\"Khusela’s statement about the ANCYL GP puts the ANC into disrepute. Unelected officials should not be writing statements on behalf of the org [sic],\" she tweeted. \nOn Sunday, Sangoni appeared to hit back with a Facebook post – complete with a selfie – while on her way to the ANC’s Gauteng lekgotla. \n\"Junior not junior. Elected unelected. Yona leyo [that one],\" she posted. \nOn Sunday, former ANC national media co-ordinator Nomfanelo Kota described Zuma’s comment as belittling. \n\"Khusela Sangoni is a tried and tested product of our movement who has earned her stripes, not only in the progressive Youth Movement, but also in ANC structures. She is an ANC leader, an honour she earned through her sterling work in the movement, not by birth,\" she said in a Facebook post. \n\"Her royalty is also a matter she does not flout [sic] and has never used to her advantage. How one begins to see her as a 'junior' in the ANC Communication machinery remains quite a mystery to me.\" \nKota, who was also a former deputy secretary general of the ANC Youth League, said Zuma’s comment \"defies logic and speaks to a creeping culture of entitlement by birth not by credentials to our body politic\". \n\"Through this negligent and irresponsible attack on Khusi, she has urinated on the public standing of that office by attacking its mouthpiece, opening up the organization to external attacks. \n\"What makes this black on black violence, more brutal is the fact that at a time when she was appointed as a Chief of Staff in a National Ministry under Minister Cwele we were the first to say, she too has a right to serve the people of our country and that her gender, age and family name, should not be used to disadvantage her.\" Join the conversation! \n24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24 .
