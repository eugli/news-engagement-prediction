In this case, we had to build everything up to the skeleton in a renderable way because the cracked skin and extruded bones exposed a lot of the underlying anatomy.\" \nAnd how did they go about digitally creating Batman's home city? \"One of MPC’s largest tasks was to create a digital Gotham City. Creating this vast and complex environment required months of planning and detailed mapping,\" MPC explained on its website. \"The beauty and challenge of urban development is that every city is the product of decades of development and progress. To ensure the city felt realistically developed through time, the team decided to recreate and combine large sections of existing selected city sections and adapt the architecture and layout to fit Gotham’s. Thousands of photographs were put through MPC’s photogrammetry pipeline to create geometry and textures for each city section. This technique ensured that each building and street was completely unique which was made possible to render by MPC’s latest renderer update.\" \nFearing the actions of a god-like Super Hero left unchecked, Gotham City’s own formidable, forceful vigilante takes on Metropolis’s most revered, modern-day savior, while the world wrestles with what sort of hero it really needs. And with Batman and Superman at war with one another, a new threat quickly arises, putting mankind in greater danger than it’s ever known before. \nJustice League is slated for release on November 11, 2017. \nMORE: Awesome Batman v Superman Concept Art Featuring Doomsday / Cool Batman V Superman Concept Art Featuring Alternate Doomsday Designs --- \nHave you seen LEGO Batman yet?
