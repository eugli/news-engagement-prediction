Uniform/official not ours. We expect better from responsible citizens like you.” \nThe author on Wednesday, however, tweeted an `apology' and an advice, which again out De in the dock. \nAfter being trolled on the social media, De yesterday tweeted: “Mumbai/Maharashtra Police, pranaam. No offence intended. M.P. police, consult a dietician,if it's an asli ,undoctored image doing the rounds”. However, her “consult a dietician” advice did not go down well with Twitterati. \nFed up of being body-shamed on social media for the last three years, Jogawat, who is due to retire in 2019, told The Times of India: \"I am planning to consult my lawyer and will think about sending a notice to De. It hurts when I see my photo on social media or when people tell me about it. India is a democratic country and people have freedom to express their views, but it shouldn't hurt or shame someone.\" \nHe further said: \"Shobha De is a big personality and people of such prominence should express or write responsibly. Had she body shamed someone close to him? I am not fat since childhood. I became fat when my gall bladder was removed as it was infected because of stones. She posted my picture on her account but will she pay for my treatment.\" \nJogawat added that he does not know who clicked his picture and circulated on social media. \"It may have been clicked during an outstation duty but I don't who clicked it. It's an old picture when I was a sub-inspector.\" \nJogawat, who joined the police force in 1979 as a police constable with Ratlam police, has rendered his services as a police officer in Shajapur and Ujjain. \nShobhaa De tweets `apology` to Mumbai Police but is being trolled again – Know why \nCurrently, he is posted at police lines in Nimuch. \nHe underwent an operation of gall bladder in 1993 after which he gradually gained weight and became obese.   14:24 More from zeenews", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T11:27:06.386+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
