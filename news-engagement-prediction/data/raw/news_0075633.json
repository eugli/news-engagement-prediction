Nothing is planned at this point.”\nBut on a night when all five members were in the house to remember an excellent era of Pistons basketball, Hamilton gave a hearty endorsement.\n“Our motto was we’re the best five alive before every game,” Hamilton said before his jersey retirement ceremony. \"That was our chant in the middle of the huddle, best five alive.”\n“We all knew that in order for us to be great at what we do, we needed each other. We needed our brothers.”\nRasheed Wallace.

He was an elite-level defender, could guard on the perimeter and in the post, could shoot the ball from three and score in the post, and was a good passer.\n“In a lot of ways, he was the linchpin in that whole thing. But he hadn’t been here as long, so I don’t think he has ever gotten the recognition that those other guys have gotten. Even though people like him here, he maybe did not get the same adoration from the fans the other guys have gotten.”\nHamilton had even more praise for Wallace.\n“I tell people this all the time, Rasheed Wallace is the most talented player I ever played with in the NBA, but he was willing to sacrifice in order for his brothers to get some the glory, too,” Hamilton said.\nPrince was the Pistons’ first-round pick in 2002. He was the fifth option once Wallace arrived, Hamilton said his sacrifice was needed. He said Prince could have been a leading scorer on another team.\nContact Vince Ellis at vellis@freepress.com .
