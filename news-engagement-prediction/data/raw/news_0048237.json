But with the years going by, how could she still remain youthful? \nNow hosting a new show about beauty, Korean pop star Sandara Park gives fans full access to her beauty secrets, particularly on maintaining a young-looking skin. \nThe former teen star who still unbelievably looks young at 32 told Korean entertainment news site Dispatch (as reported by ABS-CBN) during the shoot of “Get It Beauty 2017″ that she prioritizes taking care of her “inner beauty.” By such, she meant inner health which refers to the inner workings of the body, and how it directly affects outer physical beauty. ADVERTISEMENT \nPark recommended the use of supplements such as collagen and vitamins that help boost cellular function and eventually give a suppler, more youthful-looking glow. \nThe former member of the now-defunct Korean girl pop group 2EN1 said her other “beauty secret” is giving her face a good make-up base which she believes is essential to giving her the look she desires. According to the singer-actress, she uses make-up products such as a toner, serum, eye cream and moisturizer before she goes to bed. \nDara, as how she’s known now internationally, said she minimally puts make-up for a day look. She says keeping your make-up not too obvious is the real secret to a youthful glow.
