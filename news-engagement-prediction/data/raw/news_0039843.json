Credit Richard Drew/Associated Press Ashley Graham sauntered down the runway at Michael Kors on Wednesday, her ultracurvy frame swaddled in silver fox. Days earlier, Jacky O’Shaughnessy, 65, walked at Tome, her silver hair unfussily swept off her face. And at J. Crew, too, among a cast of “real people” that included a yoga teacher and a stylist’s mother, was the actress and comedian Sandra Bernhard, vamping for the cameras as she pointedly told reporters that in the current political climate, “It is important that everyone be represented.” Each woman in her way was pleading the case for diversity, a concept that lately has broadened to embrace not just minorities, but people of every gender preference, shape and age. Not your conventional runway stars, they included the 39-year-old African-born Alek Wek, who walked at the Row; the amply proportioned Georgia Pratt at Tome; and Candice Huffine and Marquita Pring at Prabal Gurung, each wearing a waist-cinched midi-dress much like those paraded by the size 0 models. “With all the things happening around us, I could not justify to myself the idea ‘Let me just make pretty clothes, escapist fare,’” Mr. Gurung said. “It all seems to me so tone-deaf.” Besides, he said, as a designer, “I realize I have an audience, and a platform.” “We are a medium that can take the message forward,” Mr. Gurung added.

Parading just one plus-size model on the runway can, after all, seem perfunctory at best. But for many designers, inclusive casting was not a stunt but a visceral response to the current cultural tone. Photo Georgia Pratt at Tome.

Crew.

Honey Dijon, who models occasionally; and Ms. Graham, who made history last year as the first curvy woman to appear on the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition.
