Last weekend at Mar-a-Lago, he expressed to associates and friends that he liked former United Nations ambassador John Bolton for the job, and that he was concerned that Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster had bad-mouthed him during the campaign, according to people who spoke to Trump. \nAt least one person left their conversation with Trump Saturday thinking Bolton was the favorite. \nBut on Monday, Trump was sitting beside McMaster, with the president announcing that he would be the new security adviser. It was unclear what changed his mind, or if he was ever committed to Bolton. One person with knowledge of the decision-making said some of Trump's advisers convinced him Bolton was \"too controversial,\" particularly after the Flynn fiasco. \nChris Christie has told President Donald Trump he is not interested in joining the administration and instead plans to join the private sector after he leaves Trenton next year. | Getty \nTrump often says different things to different advisers and aides, leaving them all a little unsure what will happen. On the day that Flynn was eventually removed as national security adviser, Trump wavered throughout the afternoon, seeking advice from various aides, allies, friends and associates. \nHours before Flynn was out, one person close to Trump said: \"I don't know if he stays or goes.\" Another person who said he talked to Trump said: \"Flynn is definitely out.\" A third person said Flynn could survive. \nSeveral days after Flynn was forced to resign, Trump was still asking friends if he made the right decision, and what they thought of Flynn, according to one person who regularly talks to Trump. Contrary to his public persona, Trump does not enjoy firing people, several allies and advisers said. \n“He wants to hear from everyone all the time,” Sam Nunberg, a longtime aide, of Trump’s practices. \"He is always asking questions.\" \nSunshine said Trump’s hiring instincts were good “because he has a lot of people who have been with him since the 1970s.” But the longtime Trump friend said she was worried about the advice he was getting from others on 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. and is glad he continues to reach out to old friends. \n“He’s a prisoner in the White House,” she said. “He is under the influence of all these people who are giving him the wrong advice.” \nTrump’s search for a secretary of state particularly captured what can seem like a chaotic hiring process. After his advisers had narrowed down the list to a small group of finalists, Trump took a sudden meeting with Rex Tillerson and then decided he wanted the ExxonMobil CEO to lead Foggy Bottom. A number of Trump's friends and advisers said they didn't see Tillerson as a strong candidate, while Trump told others that the CEO was the emerging favorite. By Tara Palmeri \nTrump’s aides have also learned ways to sway his decision-making. After Tillerson had been confirmed, Trump spiked Tillerson’s choice for deputy secretary, Elliott Abrams, a seasoned GOP foreign policy hand. Trump had read Abrams’ critical comments about him last year in a briefing book before meeting with Abrams in the Oval Office — a discovery that didn’t seem accidental. Several people close to Trump say whoever controls the information that gets to him about a nominee has significant power. \n“He remembers slights, but in this case, it was someone who didn’t want Abrams making sure Trump saw those past statements,” said one source familiar with the meetings, noting that Trump has a reputation for a short attention span. “Because we know Trump isn’t poring over every word that’s in those briefing books on his own.” \nTrump also becomes obsessed with hiring certain people, even if they have told him no or if Trump has passed them over for other jobs. \nAfter Rudy Giuliani backed out of the secretary of state race, Trump continued to ask if Giuliani wanted to join the administration, according to a person familiar with their conversations. He had already offered Christie the labor secretary job before he chose Puzder, two people close to Trump said. \nHe has also become fixated on Gen. Jack Keane, whom Trump met several years ago in New York City when both were receiving a \"Man of the Year\" award at a charity dinner. Keane, 75, turned down Trump's invitation to consider the defense secretary job and suggested fellow four-star Gen. James Mattis, who now has the job. \nAs his administration began to search for Flynn's replacement last week, Trump again suggested Keane to associates, even though he'd only months ago said no to a cabinet position for personal reasons, one source close to the administration said. “He's rough and tough and made an impression on Trump,” the source said. \"It's all based on this one initial encounter.\" \nTrump’s obvious deference to decorated military officials, several of whom have joined his administration, has reassured veterans of Washington’s national security establishment who worry about an untested, impulsive commander in chief and a West Wing light on governing experience. \n“There’s a wide sense among longtime Washington people who look at the Trump administration and see a guy like Jared Kushner running it and feel some resentment,” said one senior GOP foreign policy adviser on Capitol Hill. “It’s like, ‘We did our time in the mud and he’s bypassed all that and is in the senior job.’ There’s this wide sense that they aren’t qualified en masse.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:52:54.514+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
