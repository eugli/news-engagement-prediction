Story Continued Below \nTrump’s approval is a slight uptick from where he stood in Quinnipiac’s Jan. 26 survey but 4 points lower than just two weeks ago. Meantime, his disapproval rating has steadily climbed, from 44 percent days after he took office to 51 percent on Feb. 7 and 55 percent Wednesday. \nA majority of respondents said Trump is not honest (55 percent), doesn’t have good leadership skills (55 percent) or care about everyday Americans (53 percent), isn’t level-headed (63 percent), doesn’t share their values (60 percent) and is doing more to divide the country than unite it (58 percent). However, a majority also said they believe Trump is a strong (64 percent) and intelligent (58 percent) person. \n“President Donald Trump’s popularity is sinking like a rock,” said Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University poll. “He gets slammed on honesty, empathy, level-headedness and the ability to unite. And two of his strong points, leadership and intelligence, are sinking to new lows. This is a terrible survey one month in.” \nCongress doesn’t fare any better. Republicans, who hold majorities in both chambers in Congress, have a 31 percent approval rating and 62 percent disapproval rating. And Democrats’ approval rating is 32 percent, while their disapproval rating is 59 percent. \nHalf of the respondents disapprove of the media’s coverage of Trump, but more than 6 in 10 disapprove of how the president responds. Sixty-one percent said they disapprove of the way Trump talks about the news media, which he tweeted last week is “the enemy of the American People!” \nDespite Trump’s critical review of the press, which he repeatedly assails as “dishonest” and calls “fake news,” voters trust the media more than Trump. Fifty-two percent of respondents said they trust the media to tell the truth about important issues, while just 37 percent said the same of the president.
