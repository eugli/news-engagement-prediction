Tim Cook with a student at The Brit School of Performing Arts and Technology Credit: Geoff Pugh for The Telegraph \n“It has to be ingrained in the schools, it has to be ingrained in the public”, said Mr Cook. “There has to be a massive campaign. We have to think through every demographic. \n\"We need the modern version of a public service announcement campaign. It can be done quickly if there is a will.” \nT he rise of fake news was being driven by unscrupulous firms determined to attract online readers at any cost, he said. \n“We are going through this period of time right here where unfortunately some of the people that are winning are the people that spend their time trying to get the most clicks, not tell the most truth,” he said. “It’s killing people’s minds in a way.” All of us technology companies need to create some tools that help diminish the volume of fake news Tim Cook \nT ech firms, which have been criticised for doing too little, also need to up their game, he said. \n“All of us technology companies need to create some tools that help diminish the volume of fake news. \n\"We must try to squeeze this without stepping on freedom of speech and of the press, but we must also help the reader. Too many of us are just in the complain category right now and haven’t figured out what to do.” \nHe said that this crackdown would help providers of quality journalism and help drive out clickbait. “The outcome of that is that truthful, reliable, non-sensational, deep news outlets will win,” Mr Cook said. \n“The [rise of fake news] is a short-term thing, I don’t believe that people want that at the end of the day.” A new approach was required in schools, he said. “It’s almost as if a new course is required for the modern kid, for the digital kid.” But he is optimistic. \n“In some ways kids will be the easiest to educate. At least before a certain age, they are very much in listen and understand [mode], and they then push their parents to act. We saw this with environmental issues: kids learning at school and coming home and saying why do you have this plastic bottle? Why are you throwing it away?”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:27:56.063+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
