One is a rigid lever that makes walking long distances easy and efficient. \nThe other one is a grasping device, much more mobile and less effective at walking on two legs. Fossil feet of early human ancestors are nearly always compared with chimpanzee feet, making knowledge of their foot biomechanics crucial for understanding how the human foot evolved. \nPrior to this research, no one has been able to actually investigate whether differences existed between humans and chimpanzees in how the foot works during walking on two legs. \nTo find out, researchers used high-speed motion capture to measure three-dimensional foot motion in chimpanzees and humans walking at similar speeds. They then compared ranges of mid-foot motion between species. \nContrary to expectations, the researchers found that human feet are more - not less - mobile than chimpanzees walking on two limbs. \nNicholas Holowka from Harvard University in the US, said \"This finding upended our assumptions about how the feet of both humans and chimpanzees work. Based on simple visual observation, weve long known that human feet are stiffer than those of chimpanzees and other apes when the heel is first lifted off the ground in a walking step\". \nHolowka added, \"What surprised us was that the human midfoot region flexes dramatically at the end of a step as the foots arch springs back into place following its compression during weight-bearing\". \n\"This flexion motion is greater than the entire range of motion in the chimpanzee mid foot joints during a walking step, leading us to conclude that high mid foot joint mobility is actually advantageous for human walking,\" Holowka said. \nHolowka further said, \"We never would have discovered this without being able to study chimpanzees with advanced motion capture technology\". \nUltimately, according to the findings, the fact that the traditional dichotomy between humans and chimpanzees has been disproven means that researchers may have to rethink what can be learned from the fossil feet of humans earliest ancestors. \nThe study was published in the Journal of Human Evolution. \n(With PTI inputs) First Published: Thursday, February 9, 2017 - 19:56 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:26:22.143+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
