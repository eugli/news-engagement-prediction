(CDN FILE PHOTO) \nThe plans to operate a Hybrid road train in Cebu City, which was supposed to start on Wednesday, February 15, will have to wait pending the completion of the assessment of its road test held on January 31. \nRafael Yap, head of the Cebu City Transportation Office (CCTO), said ongoing assessment will include the determination of the train’s route and when its operation will commence in the city. \nBut even before the road train could start to run on city streets, members of Piston-Cebu expressed opposition to its operation here.

(This will only fatten the pockets and the coffers of big businesses who will privatize our transportation.)” FOLLOW INQUIRER ON:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T15:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T13:00:14.539+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
