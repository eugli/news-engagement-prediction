DREAM FIGHTS FOR LESNAR \nIt’s clear to see why, Lesnar isn’t going to be around forever and he’s seen as a once in a lifetime athlete; a freak of nature who will be sorely missed when he calls it a day – despite negative feelings fans may have towards him.

Article continues below \nThe former ECW Champion was often seen as the next Lesnar, once the latter had left the company and despite plenty of promise, he was never able to hit the heights and expectations Vince McMahon had set. LASHLEY VS. LESNAR? \nSince leaving, he’s become a much better wrestler and like Lesnar, he’s entered the work of mixed martial arts having competed in Strikeforce and Bellator. \nSpeaking to Sports Illustrated , he’s now reiterated his desire to battle Lesnar, in any sort of fight. \n“I want that fight with Brock Lesnar,” said Lashley. “I don’t care if it’s in the ring, the cage, or in a street fight. \n“Brock is at one of the highest points in the business, so high that they’re trying to bring him down to make other stars. \n“Brock brings legitimacy to the business, and he has Paul Heyman with him to do everything else he can’t do. \n“I’m completely up for that fight.” \nMaybe once the current programme with Goldberg concludes, WWE could try making this happen as it’ll surely be a money-making rivalry. \nWould you like to see Lashley take on Lesnar in a fight?
