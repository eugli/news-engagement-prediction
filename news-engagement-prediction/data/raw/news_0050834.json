(CBC)\nIn addition to the severance package, Martin was given a lump-sum payment of about $4.7 million for a \"supplemental executive retirement plan,\" in lieu of collecting a pension.\nThe benefits paid to Martin, including his 2016 bonus and vehicle allowance, were \"appropriate\" and \"reasonable.\" Paddon concluded.\nShould have known implications He also noted that in the evidence collected for his report, there was nothing found to indicate the provincial government assessed the implications of Martin's departure or severance.\n\"Certainly given Mr. Martin's profile — he was arguably one of the highest paid civil servants in the province and certainly had one of the highest profiles — having some research and some assessment of the circumstances while this was all transpiring perhaps could have saved some time and effort here,\" he said.\nIn a statement, Premier Dwight Ball emphasized that the size of Martin's severance was dependent on a contract signed by the former Progressive Conservative government.\n\"The auditor general has determined that government did not direct Nalcor's board of directors regarding the contract of Ed Martin,\" Ball said in a statement issued by Executive Council.\n\"The contractual obligations owed to the former CEO were negotiated and signed under the former administration.\"\nLast June, former Nalcor board chair Ken Marshall released documents that showed the board warned government that Martin would have to be paid a full severance package, and that Ball and Natural Resources Minister Siobhan Coady were told about the package by email prior to an April 20 board meeting.\n According to Paddon, the Department of Finance used practices consistent with that for other public service pension plan members for determining Martin's pension benefits.\nThe review by Paddon was commissioned by cabinet in May of 2016, after weeks of controversy following Martin's departure from Nalcor and the subsequent resignation of the board of directors.\nWith files from On the Go", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T22:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:28:58.410+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
