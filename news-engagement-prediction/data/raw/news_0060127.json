When did you get interested in photography? \nA. In college, I worked for a university photographer on campus. He made a huge impression on me.

You had other jobs before forming your photography business? \nA. My background is in film editing. I worked at a production company. I became a film editor and edited TV commercials for 10 years. \nQ. What's your favorite place for taking photos? \nA. That would be New Orleans. I love New Orleans. I love the French Quarter and the architecture and the people. \nQ. What are the most difficult photos you've ever taken? \nA. Photograph all the storefronts for the new owners of Market Square. A lot of fog had rolled in. By the time fog lifted, I had less than 24 hours before the scaffolding came up. \nQ. What did you do? \nA. They wanted an aerial shot. I had to climb up a fire escape and up a roof into the clock tower. It was thrilling but a little challenging as well. \nQ. What are the challenges of being a photographer? \nA. I don't find anything to be a challenge. Especially fine arts. That's probably 50 percent of my business. \nQ. What are some photos you're proudest of? \nA. I did a series for the factory that made the statue for the Oscars. I was in such a gritty industrial space watching these factory workers punch in their time clock. There was a sign with how many accident-free days. \nQ. What do most people not know about photographers? \nA. The time I spend editing and post production is always double the photography. Even though the shoot is done, my work is just beginning. \nQ. Any advice for amateur photographers? \nA. Go with your instincts. Be quick to the draw. Don't feel you have to spend a lot of time with a tripod. Use natural light and avoid using a flash. \nTwitter: @reporterdude \nShout Out is a weekly feature in which we get to know and introduce our readers to their fellow community members and local visitors throughout suburban Chicago.
