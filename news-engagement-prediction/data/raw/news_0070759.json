She used her religion to try to strengthen her point about why she was so critical of Islam and Muslims. \n“I disagree with following an ideology that abuses women, kills gays, mutilates female children and murders apostates,” she tweeted .\n\n\n“My view on Islam is not ONLY about their penchant for violence, it's their view on homosexuality, women's worth, polygamy,\" she wrote . \nJameson continued: \"Even moderate muslims [sic] believe homosexuality is a criminal offense, polygamy is the norm, women are considered animals. Shall I go on?\"\nA social media user accused Jameson of \"Jew loving,\" to which she responded, \"I am a Zionist Jew, you cockroach.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:57:48.500+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
