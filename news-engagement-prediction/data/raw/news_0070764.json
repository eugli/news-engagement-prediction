Still, Italy brought \"broad charges\" against her for a plot she says she had no direct part in. \nThe abduction was part of the controversial program, implemented under President George W. Bush, and entailed taking terror suspects to countries where torture is allowed. Omar -- who turned out to be a \"nobody,\" according to De Sousa -- was held at an American military base in Germany before being flown to Cairo, Egypt, where he says he was tortured. \nHe was soon released from prison for lack of prosecutable evidence against him. \nIn 2009, De Sousa, along with 25 other Americans, was convicted in absentia on kidnapping and other charges related to the abduction. Several were since pardoned and not one has done time in prison. The Italians also convicted Omar in absentia of \"criminal association for the purposes of international terrorism\" and sentenced him to six years in prison. \nDe Sousa described herself as a \"scapegoat\" for a program authorized by officials at the highest levels of U.S. government. \nThe former agent, who spent the night in a women's prison near Lisbon after a Portuguese court ordered police to extradite her, said she had hoped President Trump would intervene on her behalf.
