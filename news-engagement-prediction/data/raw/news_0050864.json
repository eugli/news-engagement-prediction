It doesn't feel right to me. \n\"I feel almost like alienated or you're trying to purposely alienate me by making me win rap awards, or either just pacify me by handing me something, putting me in that category, cos it's the only place you can figure out where to put me. \n\"Maybe because I've rapped in the past or because I'm black, I can't figure out why.\" Drake was the world's most streamed artist of 2016 Credit: PA \nDrake is currently touring in the UK on his \"Boy Meets World\" tour. \nHe said the Grammys tried to convince him to cancel two shows in Manchester to attend the ceremony.
