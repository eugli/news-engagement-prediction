Image copyright AP Image caption Some 24 people were reportedly arrested \nSeveral windows were smashed on homes during the rally, police said. \nSome 24 people were arrested, including eight women and six juveniles, according to the Los Angeles Times. \nAnaheim police told the newspaper the dispute arose from \"ongoing issues\" with young people walking across the officer's property. \nDuring the ensuing argument, the officer detains the 13-year-old, whom he says threatened to shoot him.

Image copyright AP Image caption Police arrested two of the boys, but not the off-duty officer \nThe man, still holding on to the 13-year-old, pulls a pistol and a single gunshot rings out, though it is not clear if he fired deliberately. \nPolice arrested two of the boys, but not the off-duty officer. \nA 13-year-old faces charges of battery and making criminal threats. \nA 15-year-old was detained on suspicion of assault and battery. \nThe off-duty officer has been placed on administrative leave, pending an inquiry. \nAn Anaheim woman, who claims to be the 13-year-old's mother, described the video on Facebook as \"devastating\" and \"disturbing\".
