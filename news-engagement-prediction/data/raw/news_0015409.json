The situation has been terrible for so long and it is especially tense now.\"\nOlga, an Avdiivka resident, told Al Jazeera that many of the buildings bore the scars of war and death.\n\"I was sitting on the sofa listening to the radio ... suddenly there was a huge explosion - it was like everything went into slow motion. The windows were smashed in,\" she said.\n\"Later, there was a second explosion which was so loud we lost our hearing for a few seconds. A shell had hit the fourth floor. Thank God, the people who own it weren't there at the time. Otherwise, we would have had to dig them from under the rubble.\"\nAl Jazeera's Charles Stratford, reporting from the town, said that, with rebel positions only a few kilometres away, there was no safe place for the people to seek refuge.\n\"A government agency has set up a camp with a soup kitchen and tents to keep residents warm amid the desperately cold weather,\" he said.\n\"Inside the tents, however, people say more government help is needed.\"\nREAD MORE: Mothers in search of disappeared sons \nLudmilla Voronina, an elderly woman from the area, told Al Jazeera: \"I have no job and no pension, so how can I live? I tried to pick up aid but it was so crowded, I couldn't get anything.\"\nUkraine has been fighting pro-Russian rebels since early 2014 when mass protests brought down a pro-Russian government and replaced it with one seeking closer ties with the EU and US.\nKiev accuses Moscow of direct military involvement in the conflict, as well as military support for the rebels.\nThe Kremlin denies backing the rebels and only admits that Russian \"volunteers\" and off-duty soldiers have entered the war zone on their own free will.\nThe conflict has killed nearly 10,000 people since 2014, more than half of them civilians, and plunged Moscow's relations with the West to a post-Cold War low.\n\nSource: Al Jazeera and news agencies \nTell us what you think", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T15:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T10:30:18.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
