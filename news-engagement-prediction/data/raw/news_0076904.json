While most avant-garde labels rely on celebrities to make them household names, Sacai is building a sisterhood of devotees through other means. by Twitter From The Washington Post/Getty Images. Thanks to a booming interest in celebrity red-carpet dressing and street style, the public’s fashion fluency is higher than ever. Because of stars like Dakota Johnson, Hari Nef, and Margot Robbie, a certain kooky, Old Master portrait aesthetic is identifiable as Gucci to even casual fashion observers. Because of Kim Kardashian West and Rihanna, a deconstructed sweatshirt over lingerie is a look to be emulated—not what you’re embarrassed the neighbor will see you in when you go out to get the morning paper. Francesco Scognamiglio may not be a household name, but because of Beyoncé’s arrival at this year’s Video Music Awards in the Italian couturier’s dress, an off-kilter funnel of pale-blue ostrich feathers framing the face is celebrated as daring and glamorous. While an unusual garment used to land a star on a “worst dressed” page in a gossip rag, celebrities have wielded fashion to turn that thinking around. The public tolerance—and even thirst—for avant-garde, boundary-pushing clothing is at an all-time high. But while many designers are glowing in the halo of these women wearing their clothing—the Rihanna or Lupita Nyong’o effect is a revered phenomenon—some of fashion’s more unconventional voices are building empires without it. Take Sacai, the line designed by Japan’s Chitose Abe, which just released an exclusive capsule collection at Saks Fifth Avenue—the type of sales-floor vote of confidence that marks fashion-establishment acceptance. At a private event for Saks customers last week, a mini-army of women—Japanese and American, short and tall, eccentric and demure, young and old—buzzed around a shy but warm Abe as acolytes might hover around a new saint whose canonization they’ve long been campaigning for. “It’s really sort of become less of a cult following,” says Saks fashion director Roopal Patel of the brand. “It’s really becoming this stateside phenomenon.” Courtesy of Saks Fifth Avenue. Though it has a loungewear vibe—and what doesn’t, these days?—the Saks collection is a succinct bite of Abe’s bread and butter: the lowly cotton T-shirt has a skirt of guipure lace for a back; a stiff terry sweatshirt dress has a hem of prim guipure-lace ruffles. “My collections are about hybridization of different components of classic or traditional items,” Abe tells Vanity Fair , “both from a structural point of view, but also in terms of usage of materials.” In other words, a visual poem that rhymes hard with soft, tough with feminine. On a woman, Sacai pieces are works of intrigue. In an archetypal garment from the Fall 2016 collection, what appears to be a twill trench coat from behind is revealed to be a kind of sleeved cape that cinches over the bodice of a knit wool dress in the front. The unusual interplay creates a current of curiosity that has built the brand’s success, Patel explains: “It’s not so much about celebrity dressing, but it’s actually about women referring the clothing to other women.” And Abe’s creations are actually quite simple to wear, perhaps a testament to the fact that she is a female designer: you put it on and forget about it, until a woman takes notice and invites herself into the sisterhood by asking the wearer about it: “Is that a dress, or a coat? Is it all one piece? And who makes it?,” she might wonder. Another Sacai customer minted. Abe insists she would rather maintain that sense of feminine union than take advantage of the celebrity platform that has propelled other brands to popular acclaim. “I am very conscious of keeping the Sacai identity intact,” she says. “I do appreciate the support of celebrities, but there has to be a genuine interest or a genuine connection or relationship with that individual.” It helps, too, that Abe’s aesthetic lends itself so easily to the athleisure aesthetic that currently has a white-knuckle grip on many designers. Two successful collaborations with Nike helped establish her look with a much larger audience (clearly, the smart collaboration or capsule collection has been a better tool for her than the well-placed celebrity moment). But make no mistake: Abe is not riding anyone’s performance-fabric coattails. When asked about how she reckons with the popularity of athletic-inspired apparel, she is firm but artfully above it all: “I don’t really follow trends.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T12:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T07:19:51.089+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
