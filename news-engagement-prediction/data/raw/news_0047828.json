They were living in a staff house on campus and students would come and hang, just to be around a family. \n“There was one young woman who I loved, I adored her,” the author says, “She started seeing this older guy who I was quite wary of immediately, there was a big age difference, and he had a back-story I found troubling. \n“She came to visit the babies, and she’d been with us maybe an hour when he started hammering on the door, saying, ‘Where is she? Where is she?’ \n“And this young woman immediately said, ‘Oh, I told him I was going to be back in 15 minutes’ – and left.” \nHeyman reflects on the moment like a salutary lesson: “While I did [tell her] at the time that I was instinctively worried about her, I think now that I would be much, much clearer and say, ‘ T his sort of behaviour is consistent with this kind of follow-on behaviour,’ but I didn’t really have the language then.” \nFifteen years later, the award-winning Australian novelist is well-versed in the patterns of domestic violence and male power. She has the language, certainly, but this ability to elucidate is predated by a deeper familiarity with the subject, stemming from her own childhood with a violent father. \nHeyman has already written about this. Her first novel, The Breaking, excavated the layers of male violence and control in a family. She didn’t talk about its autobiographical nature at the time, but it’s all there in retrospect – and now it’s between the lines of her latest novel, Storm and Grace. \n“My father was violent, it’s not secret,” says Heyman. She has written explicitly of the fear of the beatings and the bruises and the tears and the trauma that characterised her parents’ 22-year marriage. \n“When my parents were engaged my father went off to Japan and had an affair with someone and then came back and charmed my mother into staying with him. He pushed her, that’s all, just a push, but it was like, ‘You knew ! But you overrode it’.” \nThis notion of proceeding into danger in spite of niggling instinct is the fulcrum around which Storm and Grace turns, and Heyman remembers the exact moment the idea gelled for her. The Simon Gittany trial should be a wake up call for abusive men | Louise Taylor Read more \n“The Simon Gittany case was happening, and there was all the counting of dead women, and there had been the escalation where the statistics changed – instead of one woman a week killed by their partners or ex-partners, it was two a week. \n“I’d been watching the case, reading everything, and I was particularly obsessed with his new girlfriend, who was, quote unquote, ‘standing by his side’. I couldn’t stop watching her, I was thinking, ‘What the hell is going on there, you know categorically that this man is dangerous.’” \nHeyman is talking about Rachel Louise, who accompanied Gittany to his trial for the murder of his fiancee Lisa Harnum, who a court found was thrown by Gittany from their 15th floor apartment balcony after he discovered she planned to leave him. \n“I kept watching her thinking, ‘You know . You know he’s dangerous, why are you overriding your instincts?’ She knew he was violent. She might have believed that he did not kill her, but she had seen the footage of him dragging [Lisa] inside with his hand across her mouth, so whatever story she was telling herself, she was overriding what she already knew.” \nHeyman had been compulsively reading the Gittany case, and the day after he was convicted – 28 November 2013 – she went scuba diving with her teenage daughter and had a panic attack for the first time after she watched her daughter descend into the murky depths. She had to gather herself, overcome her fear, and proceed with the dive. “It felt connected to these few weeks of being immersed in and thinking about this really horrific violence,” she says. \nReading the news the next day, she saw the story of Nicholas Mevoli – a world champion in freediving, the sport of diving down into oceanic depths on one breath – who died while trying to break the record of diving to a depth of 72 metres without fins. Suddenly she can’t get enough of watching freediving videos. \nHeyman watches the video of Mevoli’s last dive, and is mesmerised by the choices he makes : he goes down, turns around to come back up, then second guesses himself and goes down again – proceeding into danger. \n“Bam!”, she says, and claps a fist into her palm. Everything coalesces. The man pushes a woman up against a wall and she finds him unbearably sexy? Girls see so many versions of that scene Kathryn Heyman \nEnter Storm Hisray and Grace Cain, the characters that materialise in this “perfect meeting” of her various obsessions. He’s a charming egotist and world champion freediver, she a young scuba enthusiast sent to interview the star for a magazine. Their attraction is demanding and obsessive from the start, extreme. \nGrace leaves her home, her friends, her unfinished university degree to follow the man determined to be the best in the world – the man also determined to possess the beautiful young Grace. They travel to his free diving headquarters in the Pacific, where Grace is inexorably pulled into an isolated world that is both seductive and dangerous. \nIf it sounds like bodices should be ripping at this point, you’d be missing the point of Storm and Grace. Yes, the broody alpha male is irresistible to the vulnerable young woman but Heymansteps inside this popular culture trope and tears it to shreds. When it comes to dangerous male power, the bodice-ripping is half the problem. \n“You look at almost any big pop culture film – let’s not even talk about the 50 Shades thing – but there was this thing going around recently, scenes from Star Wars, where Harrison Ford kisses Carrie Fisher and she says, ‘Don’t you ever do that to me again’, and the next thing they’re all over each other. \n“Or that scene where the man pushes a woman up against a wall and she finds him unbearably sexy? Girls see so many versions of that scene, or the scene where the girl says ‘I’ll never kiss you’ or ‘I’ll never be with you as long as I live’ and then bam, guess what? My mother stayed with my abusive father for 22 years. That's a lot of bruises | Kathryn Heyman Read more \n“And we go, ‘Oh god that’s where the energy is, that’s where the sex is,’ we long for that. That’s Heathcliff. That’s fireworks. And boys see it too. Boys see it too.” \nGender stereotypes, the sidelining of female voice and influence, the counting of dead women, dangerous and edgy men romanticised by popular culture – all this fomented a “white hot fury” in Heyman, which in turn compels her plot towards the brutal truth of male violence. \nWhile writing she had an overriding urge to be that maternal voice shouting at the young woman to watch out, to see the signs, to look both ways. Heyman cleverly channels this via a chorus of voices that ushers us through the terrible and compelling story, and it’s not a spoiler to say who those voices are – it’s clear from the beginning. They are the dead women we have been counting. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T07:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T02:38:45.426+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
