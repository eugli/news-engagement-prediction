(Photo: DC) Hyderabad : Kammani Sreenu says that police who used to come to his house late in the night to arrest him, will now come and have chai at his new tea stall. Sreenu, 28, was arrested more than ten times in the last ten years and was even detained under PD Act.\nRecently, he approached Rajendranagar for help in rehabilitation. Police helped him to set up a tea stall which was inaugurated on Thursday. Sreenu intends to educate his daughter to see her become a teacher.\nSreenu, hailing from Vikarabad, studied till Class VII. Influenced by his friends, he started committing house thefts from 2008. He was arrested more than ten times and put in prison. His wife would plead with him to start leading a normal life but Sreenu never paid heed to her. “I was very adamant. But one day, I thought about my daughter and what she will tell about me if her friends ask her. I did not want her to grow up as the daughter of a thief.” Sreenu said.\nHis wife Kasturi said that Sreenu would always promise to stop the crimes. When his father passed away, his family members did not initially allow him to the final rites.\n“They said because of him, my father-in-law was depressed and died. We were put to shame on many occasions even by our family members.” she said.\nIn September 2016 when Sreenu was released from prison after serving one year detention, he realised his aim in life. He wants to give education to his 5-year- old daughter and see her as a teacher.\nACP Rajendranagar K Gangareddy said that they counselled him to change his life keeping in view his daughter’s future. “He will continue to be under watch. If he stays on the right path, we can help him to expand his business.” he said.\nEarlier also Cyberabad police helped three old offenders to reform and start tea stalls. One of them Vamshi Chander kidnapped a 15-year-old girl on the guise of marriage. Police arrested him in December 2016 for kidnap and rape.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T10:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T09:38:33.914+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
