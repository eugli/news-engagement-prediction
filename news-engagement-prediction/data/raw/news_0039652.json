Today's top news stories - February 16 \nThe woman, who has not been identified, is officially the second oldest mum in Spain's history, after the baby boy and girl were delivered by caesarean on Tuesday afternoon. \nA spokesperson from Recoletas Hospital in Burgos said the twins and their mother were expected to remain in hospital for \"four or five days\". \n\"There were no problems, everything went according to plan,\" the hospital spokesperson said. The hospital released video of the birth. Source: Recoletas Hospital \nThe spokesperson said the mother had travelled to the US to undergo IVF treatment before she returned to Spain pregnant. \n\"This is an exceptional case not only for the region, but also for Spain, given the fact that sheâ€™s one of the few women aged more than 58 who has managed to successfully complete her pregnancy with twins,\" the spokesperson said. \nThe oldest mother in history is Indian woman Omkari Panwar, who gave birth to twins at the age of 70. \nFellow Indian woman Daljinder Kaur was a few months shy of Panwar's record when she gave birth at the age of 70 after two years of IVF treatment. \nBritain's oldest mother, Elizabeth Adeney, was 66 when she gave birth to her son after travelling to Ukraine for treatment. \nThe latest birth has sparked controversy in Spain, after local media reported the 64-year-old mother's first child was taken from her by social services. \nRespected Spanish daily El Mundo said that child is now being cared for by relatives after authorities were concerned about the child's hygiene and lack of schooling. \nThe hospital spokesperson said she could not comment on the twins' care arrangements.
