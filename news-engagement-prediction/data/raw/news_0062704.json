And if you don’t, Ulin probably knows you—or more likely the brand/store/website you work for. As President of Men’s for UBM, the behemoth company behind the fashion industry’s leading trade shows, part of Ulin’s job is making sure brands big and small are positioned in the best way possible when buyers and editors from around the globe walk through a show. Not only does that mean Ulin is a busy man (over 500 brands are exhibiting at the Project trade show in Las Vegas at this very moment), it means he has a front-row seat to what brands are making—and selling—any given season. \nIt’s a position Ulin understands from every angle, considering he used to attend the trade shows he now oversees when he was president of J.Lindeberg U.S.A. Working for the tailoring-centric brand also helped Ulin understand how to dress well when work takes you on the road, whether it’s crisscrossing the Atlantic or the U.S.A. as he does now (from the East Coast in N.Y.C. to UBM’s West Coast offices in Santa Monica). Here, Swedish-born exec and avid runner lets us in on the ten stylish staples he’s never without, whether he’s walking a trade show floor for twelve hours or circling the Central Park Reservoir on his daily run. \n1. New Balance 880 Running Sneakers \nI started running New Balance sneakers when I was 18 because that's what my knees liked and nothing much has changed since then. My favorite is the 880 model and every time there's a new version, I order another pair and at this rate, I go through a couple pairs every year. I always pack them—and all my running gear—in my carry-on bag. Should my luggage get lost, at least I'll be able to go for a run when I arrive. \n2. J.Lindeberg Loro Piana Blazer \nClearly I'm a fan of the brand, having worked there for a long time. This jacket was a canceled sample from the Spring 2013 collection. It's a beautiful, beautiful blazer in a Loro Piana linen-blend that, thankfully, fit me. You can dress it up, you can dress it down. It's the jacket I probably wear the most because the more you wear it, the better and better it looks. It even looks good when it gets a little bit wrinkled which is great for when I'm traveling too. \n3. Bowers & Wilkins P7 Headphones \nThese headphones are a solid piece of craftsmanship. Barrow & Wilkins made the speakers that sit in Abbey Road studios back in the Beatles days and they're just singularly focused on making things sound good. These are the best over-ear headphones I've found and since I travel a lot, they let me plug into my phone or watch a movie and feel screened off from the world. They're comfortable enough that I can doze off while wearing them. \n4. Greats Brand G-Knit Sneakers \nI'm a big fan of Greats. I think I have about eight pairs from the brand at home, much to my wife's frustration. It's a nice sneaker, it's well-priced, and they're actually stylish. And this is the first sneaker I've ever gotten compliments on for wearing while walking a show floor—or anywhere, really. \n5. Happy Socks Socks \nBeing Swedish, I'm somewhat biased in liking Happy Socks. It sounds weird, but first I'll figure out what shoe I'm going to wear and then decide which socks to wear with it. Some days it's more of a graphic pattern other days it might just be a solid color. When I was a teenager I used to be very conscious about wearing just black socks, but these days I like having some sort of expression in that area. It's a fun way to inject a little personality into your wardrobe. What's nice is that you can dress up a look with their socks but the rest of your outfit doesn't look too crazy. \n6. Zachary Prell Merino Wool Zip Sweater \nI was at an event with Zachary, saw this sweater, and bought it. It's that simple. The quality is amazing—it's so soft. And it's versatile. You can wear it with a T-shirt or with a button-up shirt. I like having pieces that be made into two or three different outfits so I can limit how much I pack every time. I can wear this with one shirt one day and a different one the next and, even in my field of work, still be dressed appropriately. I think that's as important as having things you feel most comfortable in. \n7. Apple Watch \nThis is a first generation Apple Watch. It was a present to myself when I turned 40 just because. I use it a lot as an activity tracker when I'm out running, which I do quite often. It's also really great for what I would say is looking at your phone but not having to look at your actual phone. And when you by mistake answer your phone on your watch and talk into it, it becomes a little James Bond-esque. \n8. Jean Shop 'Jim' Skinny Fit Jeans \nI discovered these Jean Shop jeans from Eric Goldstein and they fit like a glove. That's really all there is to it. It's a slimmer fit but isn't one of those cuts that make you look like you're wearing leggings. They have just the right amount of stretch in them where they don't become baggy after a few wears—they hold up really well. And the wash is subtle, with just the right amount of fading. You can even take a long flight in them, something I've done many times. \n9. Customized Rhone T-Shirt \nWhen I first ran the New York City Marathon two years ago that people seemed to be yelling names, but I was pretty sure none of those people actually knew who they were yelling for. So I figured I should probably put my name on my shirt. I gave my Rhone shirt to my two kids to design it and lo and behold, when I ran it this year, people seemed to know me too. \n10. MPG Running Shorts \nI discovered MPG at [Project] in New York when the guys behind the brand were part of a run club activity that we set up—and I've been a fan ever since. I just ran the New York City marathon in these shorts. You know, when you're running 26 miles chafing is an issue but that's not an issue in these guys. They're the best shorts I've ever had.
