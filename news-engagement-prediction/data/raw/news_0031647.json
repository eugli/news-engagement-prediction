Some tips Ms Lamberg-Burnet has shared include starting with the cutlery from the outside and working your way to the centre and using your knife and fork quietly. 'Place your cutlery down when in conversation and between mouthfuls and take time eating to avoid finishing well before your date,' she advised. 'Discreetly remove an object of food from your mouth with your thumb and index finger or better still go to the bathroom and remove!' Julie Lamberg-Burnet (pictured) is the founder of the Sydney School of Protocol KNOW HOW TO TAKE YOUR BREAD AND WINE While it sounds simple, there are simple etiquette guidelines when it comes to the early part of the evening. With bread rolls, diners are encouraged to break off one bite-sized portion of the bread roll, butter it and eat - cutting it or breaking it into lots of pieces is not encouraged. Diners are also advised not to butter the bread in mid air and instead take the butter to the plate and then to the piece of bread. And when it comes to wine? 'Hold your white wine glass by the stem and the red wine by the bottom of the bowl,' Ms Lamberg-Burnet said. 'Offer your Valentine’s Day guest a beverage and let your guest decide the choice of either wine, cocktails or non-alcoholic choices. If possible find out their favorite drink prior to the date, so you can order this as a thoughtful surprise.' Drinking too much is also a bad idea and can lead to some post-date embarrassment and regret. 'Hold your white wine glass by the stem and the red wine by the bottom of the bowl,' Ms Lamberg-Burnet said OFFER TO SET THE BILL IF YOU ARE THE HOST While this is often one of the most awkward parts of a date, there is a simple solution. 'Generally speaking the host, regardless of gender, pays the bill unless you have agreed to split the bill,' Ms Lamberg-Burnet said. 'Either pre-arrange payment with the restaurant prior to the meal or during a break from the table, to avoid an awkward close to your meal.' 'Generally speaking the host, regardless of gender, pays the bill unless you have agreed to split the bill,' Ms Lamberg-Burnet said What should you NOT do on Valentine's Day? • Write sexual or risque comments particularly in a new relationship • Overwhelm your date with extravagant gifts in a new relationship • Feel compelled to do something out of character on Valentine’s Day to keep up with others expectations – be yourself! CHOOSE THE PERFECT GIFT Gifts and cards should be chosen with care and everyone should take into account whether the relationship is short or long term. Choose your gift and words based on the stage of your relationship – either a new relationship, longer term relationship, or your spouse/partner,' Ms Lamberg-Burnet said. 'Choose the best florist in your area if you wish to purchase the perfect red roses and keep the message simple – \"Happy Valentine’s\" handwritten in a beautiful card when in a new relationship. 'Add your own genuine words of warmth, happiness and gratitude when in a longer term relationship.' Ms Lamberg-Burnet suggests a gift that can be enjoyed post Valentine's Day and advises people to be thoughtful of different cultures and personal preferences.
