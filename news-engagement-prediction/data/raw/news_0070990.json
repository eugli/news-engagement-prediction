But the scale of his role was exhibited in the moments before kick-off when he led a huddle by issuing an impassioned, fist-pumping gee-up. Schmeichel was shouting more fiercely at Christian Fuchs when the defender’s early header nearly led to an own goal. But the goalkeeper walked the walk too, saving Sevilla’s spot-kick brilliantly and plenty more shots besides. Kasper Schmeichel proved that he is definitely one of Leicester's big leaders on Wednesday Leicester fans still back Claudio Ranieri Leicester fans who travelled to Seville still back Claudio Ranieri. The Italian’s name was sung within a minute of the game starting and again before half-time in a sign that this section at least are grateful for being given chance to watch their side on such a stage. There was also a reprisal of the once-favoured chant that has understandably been put away recently. ‘Champions of England, you’ll never sing that,’ Sevilla were told, tongue firmly in cheek. The mystery of Ahmed Musa The Ahmed Musa conundrum is no closer to being solved. Signed for a then club-record £16million fee last summer, he was one of the few Leicester players with previous Champions League experience but has rarely shown such quality. Musa was the shock starter and produced his usual erratic display. In fairness, he operated at centre-forward for CSKA Moscow but Ranieri uses him on the wing and that only leads to a fragmented feel to Leicester’s play. Sevilla's set up is dazzling Sevilla’s kaleidoscopic approach is dazzling to the eye. Ostensibly set up in an unorthodox 3-3-2-2 formation, rarely can Jorge Sampaoli’s side be identified as such. Every player is capable of bursting into a new position to change the picture and while Leicester were poor, many other teams have also struggled to cope. Should Arsene Wenger leave Arsenal, the Argentinian Sampaoli must be at the top of the club’s wanted list. Jamie Vardy remains a big threat Given service, Jamie Vardy can still score. The England striker was in space on the break numerous times but the balls up to him were not good enough. He gobbled up Danny Drinkwater’s fine cross though to end a run of 748 minutes without scoring. He has only had 11 shots on target in the Champions League and Premier League, suggesting assists are an issue. Demarai Gray could provide the answer. His introduction gave Leicester extra attacking guile.
