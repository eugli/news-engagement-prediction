Now, the junior staff in workplaces can rejoice at the thought that their boss in cold cubicles will have to cough up more tax. \n\nIf demonetisation had brought to the fore the contrast between the haves and have-nots, the Budget has only reaffirmed the differences between the haves and the better-offs. The war against the rich - those earning more than a crore a year - which began a year ago continues with a change in the definition of who's rich. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi is waging a war against ill-gotten wealth by banning notes, his finance minister is narrowing the battle to tax anyone who earns more than Rs 50 lakh a year. \n\nJaitley claims he would make more people pay tax because so many of them escape the taxman today. However, what he proposed in the Budget is to make people who the most tax fork out a little more. Anyone with a salary of Rs 50 lakh or below would now pay an annual tax of Rs 13,12,500 - about Rs 12,500 less. But someone with a yearly salary of Rs 60 lakh will have to pay tax of Rs 17,73,750 - roughly Rs 1.5 lakh extra. \n\nThere is no overtly populist schemes in the Budget. Yet, it's political. Post the cash crunch and hassles that followed demonetisation, lowering corporate tax would have sent out a wrong signal before crucial state Assembly elections. \n\nUnderstandably, Mr Jaitley avoided it, though he did promise a rationalisation of corporate tax in the Budget last year. However, his decision to relax the rules on Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) would benefit power and road construction companies. \n\nThe FM warns that those who deposited their unexplained cash will not have the last laugh. We will have to wait to find out whether the ban on cash deals above Rs 3 lakh would cast the tax net wider. \n\nIt's a Budget that once again tries to drive home the message that the men in Delhi does not represent a \"suit boot ki Sarkar\" but whose heart goes out for the middle and lower-class. For instance, promoters of business houses who hold their shares through trusts will have to 10 per cent tax on the dividend they receive from the companies. Till now they were spared. Last year, the FM had imposed 10 per cent tax on dividend of over Rs 10 lakh earned by individuals, Hindu undivided families and firms. This year it takes a step forward to cover trusts. \n\nOn the other hand, Jaitley tries to satisfy the constituencies that matter without toppling the apple cart: by keeping tax on stock market gains untouched it has managed not to put off traders and investors who had feared a tax on long-term capital gains and a higher securities transaction tax; reining in fiscal deficit will send out a positive signal to credit rating agencies and foreign portfolio investors - in equity as well bonds; millions of low and middle income household will find their disposable income rising Rs 1,200 a month; and countless families in smaller towns can dream of owning a home while small, hit by demonetisation, will get a tax relief if they complete these affordable projects on time. \n\nIf demonetisation was PM Modi's big political gamble, the Budget comes across like a safe bet. \n  More From Budget Jaitley's tax impact: Who pays more, who pays less & by how much Want to know what's costly and what's cheap after this Budget?
