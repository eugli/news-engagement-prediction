He's now in his fourth season in the Belgian top flight, having twice won the country’s Young Player of the Year award. \nThe Premier League's leading goalscorer is friends with the 19-year-old through his brother, Jordan, who was a teammate of Tielemans until joining Lazio last summer. \nAnd the two have grown closer since Belgium boss Roberto Martinez handed Tielemans his senior debut for the national team in November, where he was taken under the wing of Toffees hitman Lukaku. \nLukaku has revealed he offered Tielemans further advice on Friday night while back in his homeland with family, before travelling to Ostende to witness the youngster's magnificent weekend double.

He’s growing on the pitch, and he’s decisive. It’s exactly what he needs to do. \n\"I think he’s ready to go up a level in his career. He already had his passing and his leadership, now he has goals. \n\"We’d already talked about it on international duty, and he’s carried on since. I’m really happy for him.\" \nIt comes after Tielemans last week agreed with the suggestion that a move to a club like Everton is the next step in his career. \nScouts from a host of Europe’s biggest clubs have visited the Constant Vanden Stock to check up on the midfielder over the last 18 months. \nBut on RTBF radio show La Tribune , in a conversation with ex-Belgium international Marc Degryse, it was put to Tielemans that a club such as the Merseysiders - a side not considered a powerhouse, but in a major league - is his next logical step. \n“It’s what’s best to progress step by step,\" agreed the playmaker. \"What Mark says, it’s good to not burn steps and to avoid ending up on the bench and not getting game time. It’s what’s best for every footballer, I think.” poll loading Which Youri Tielemans goal was better? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:09:58.123+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
