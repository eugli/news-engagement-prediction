Sabi naman nya (De Lima) susunod naman sya,” Padilla told reporters before he went to the senator’s office Friday morning. ADVERTISEMENT \n(It cannot be stopped. De Lima already said she will obey the warrant.) \nDe Lima’s lawyers would go first to the Muntinlupa court this Friday morning for a scheduled hearing on a motion to quash they filed before it. \n“And we might go to higher court later on with regards to this particular judgment,” Padilla said.
