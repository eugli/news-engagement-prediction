Rowling have been bickering back-and-forth on Twitter for quite some time now, but the Harry Potter author just delivered a near-fatal blow to her online rival. \nRowling tweeted out some kind words that were previously written about her in the press. \nThe snippet contained the lines including, “Ms Rowling definitely matters” and “by encouraging children to read, feel inspired and be creative, she has had a greater impact on the world than most of the other names on it.” \nIn the tweet, which she posted on Valentine’s Day, Rowling wrote: “Just been sent this! Could the writer let me know who he is? I’d love to thank him!” Just been sent this! Could the writer let me know who he is? I'd love to thank him! #Valentines pic.twitter.com/OQtbxPD6AL — J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) February 14, 2017 \nThe trap had been set. \nPiers Morgan saw the tweet and chastised the author almost immediately. \n“Priceless #humblebrag BS,” Morgan tweeted, “Nobody plays the celebrity game more abusively or ruthlessly than you, Ms ‘Intensely Private Billionaire’.” \nBut here’s the thing ... THE KIND WORDS WERE WRITTEN BY PIERS MORGAN HIMSELF IN A 2010 ARTICLE FOR THE DAILY MAIL. \nAnd the internet lit up with delight: Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. He doesn't realise. This is the best day of my life. pic.twitter.com/fl0lFPHXf5 — Jamie Ross (@JamieRoss7) February 14, 2017 \n“Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. He doesn’t realise. This is the best day of my life,” wrote one Twitter user. \n“My favourite thing on twitter at the moment is piers Morgan getting the absolute sh*t ripped out of him by jk Rowling.” \n“You’ll find she’s just run him over, had him stuffed; he’s now above her mantle #killerblow.” \nIn response to the online mockery, Morgan claimed that he wasn’t fooled for one second: “Relax, quarter-wit, I knew what it was. Just surprised I put her as high as 97th,” he tweeted. \nSorry Piers, but you got owned. Relax, quarter-wit, I knew what it was. Just surprised I put her as high as 97th. https://t.co/HCzx4Ius4E", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T07:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:57:32.526+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
