And whatever Cameroon achieved at the AFCON will not stop us from being at Russia 2018,” he said. \n“I haven’t seen anything special in the Cameroonian team. They do not have what it takes to stop the Super Eagles. \n“No team can stop us from the World Cup.” \nNigeria lead their qualifying group for the World Cup with six points from two matches, while Cameroon have two points. \nZambia and Algeria are on a point each with only the overall winners advancing to next year’s World Cup in Russia.
