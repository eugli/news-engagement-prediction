(He also shows up on the TV show, narrating its final episode.) Last night, Miranda’s enthusiasm for the show’s brothers led him to a Los Angeles release party for the series, and, more importantly, the karaoke after-party that followed . Hot and fresh out the kitchen with @Lin_Manuel , the greatest karaoke night crasher there ever was. pic.twitter.com/7iGgASblal — Liz Kerin (@liz_kerin) February 24, 2017 TFW your best friend duets with @Lin_Manuel at karaoke night at @LostKnightPub . #Hamilton pic.twitter.com/GB3BStuzrY — Alex Regnery (@aregnery) February 24, 2017 \nFans caught a number of clips of Miranda taking the stage, crooning R. Kelly’s “Ignition (Remix)“ with Broadway-honed pipes. Still, the evening’s most exciting moment came when someone had the chutzpah to cue up Miranda’s own “Alexander Hamilton” in front of him; the possible EGOT winner took the dare, hopping on stage multiple times to nail Hamilton’s parts of the song. Crashing someone else’s turn on the mic is usually a karaoke faux pas, but we’re pretty sure this one earns an exception.
