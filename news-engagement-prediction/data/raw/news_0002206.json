The XL Center holds approximately 14,750 for hockey. \n“This is a ready market anxious for an NHL team, eager to fill seats, buy merchandise, and support your team,” they wrote. “Your AHL affiliate is in nearby Bridgeport, allowing quick and easy access to your minor-league players, and represents a footing in Connecticut of the Islander franchise.” \nThe Islanders, who declined to comment, have been looking into building a new home arena in the metropolitan area since Ledecky and Malkin took over control of the team from Wang in July. Islanders Report: Barclays Center wants New York Islanders to go \nNHL commissioner Gary Bettman, speaking at the All-Star Game last weekend, said the Islanders are “committed” to New York. \n  \nSources have said the Islanders have spoken to the Mets about building an arena next to Citi Field in Flushing and New York Racing Association about an arena next to Belmont Racetrack in Elmont. Nassau Executive Ed Mangano said this week he met with Ledecky in November to pitch a return to Nassau Coliseum, which is run by the same group that manages Barclays Center. \nNewsday has reported that the Islanders and Barclays Center can both opt out of their 25-year license agreement next January. The Islanders can choose to leave after next season or the 2018-19 season; if Barclays Center opts out, the Islanders would leave after the 2018-19 season. \nEven if the Islanders secure a site for a new building, experts say it’s all but impossible to have a new arena built by the time they would leave Barclays Center. That means the Islanders, in such a scenario, would either need to find an interim home or work out an extension with Barclays Center. \nThe Islanders, who are in their second year at Barclays Center, have struggled with attendance in Brooklyn; their average crowd of 12,773 this season ranks as 29th in the NHL, ahead of only Carolina. Players have also complained about the ice, which Bettman described as a problem fundamental to the arena and is “not something that can be fixed in the short term.” Nassau Mangano: Islanders talked possible Coliseum return Subscribe to Newsday’s sports newsletter \nReceive stories, photos and videos about your favorite New York teams plus national sports news and events.\nsign up", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T01:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:51:57.176+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
