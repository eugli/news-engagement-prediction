Dean Heller (R-Nev.) said Sunday night he fears President Donald Trump 's executive order on immigration went too far, tweeting out that the order has \"the appearance of religious ban.\" \"I share the president's desire to protect our nation from harm,\" Heller said in a string of tweets. \"I agree that better vetting and border protection measures are necessary. That's why I support the thorough vetting of individuals entering our country. However, I am deeply troubled by the appearance of religious ban. The use of an overly broad executive order is not the way to strengthen national security. I encourage the administration to partner with Congress to find a solution.\" \nSen.
