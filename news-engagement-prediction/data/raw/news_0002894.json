The Lilac Ledge apartment complex in Waukegan. (Luke Hammill / Lake County News-Sun) Luke Hammill News-Sun Privacy Policy \nLilac Ledge Apartments, a 12-story, 203-unit apartment building in downtown Waukegan serving low-income and retired tenants, will be undergoing a $4.7 million renovation over the summer, financed with federal tax credits and tax-exempt bonds intended to encourage the development of affordable housing. \nAndy DeBruler, head of real estate development at the Libertyville -based DeBruler Company, which manages the building, said the company plans to replace 2,400 windows, two elevators and the roof; upgrade the business and fitness centers; and add a full-time social service coordinator and a full-time wellness nurse. DeBruler also wants to install granite counters, new cabinets and energy-efficient light fixtures, he said. \n\"It's time,\" DeBruler said. \"It's 40 years old. We've kept up on the deferred maintenance, but some of the big-ticket stuff … their time is up.\" Waukegan voters from the Nickels and Dimes neighborhood on River Road had a chance to hear from Mayor Wayne Motley and the two people trying to unseat him Thursday night during a candidate forum hosted at Oak Grove Elementary School.\nThe two challengers, aldermen Sam Cunningham, 1st, and Lisa May,... \nWaukegan voters from the Nickels and Dimes neighborhood on River Road had a chance to hear from Mayor Wayne Motley and the two people trying to unseat him Thursday night during a candidate forum hosted at Oak Grove Elementary School. \nThe two challengers, aldermen Sam Cunningham, 1st, and Lisa May,... (Luke Hammill) \nDeBruler said the company hopes to begin the rehabilitation in late June or early July. He said none of the tenants — most of whom qualify for Section 8 housing vouchers — would likely be displaced, though he said there is money set aside if tenants need to be relocated to a hotel for a few days. \nThe Lake County Board last month approved the issuance of $22 million in federally tax-exempt bonds, which DeBruler said will be used to renovate the building, pay for soft costs such as lawyers and finance a $13.5 million sale of the building as part of a reorganization of the ownership structure necessary to qualify for tax benefits. \n\"We're kind of actually selling it to ourselves,\" DeBruler said. \nLake County Finance Director Gary Gordon said the county is only serving as a conduit or pass-through agency, so it assumes no risk associated with repaying the bonds. \n\"It's private money,\" Gordon said. \"They'll be borrowing the money directly from the bank.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T23:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:20:01.585+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
