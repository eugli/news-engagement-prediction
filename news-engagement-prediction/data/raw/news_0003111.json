Case in point: Donald Trump’s nominee for the next SCOTUS justice, Neil Gorsuch, opted for this gem in the 1988 Columbia University yearbook.\nFriend emails turns out Neil Gorsuch was in her class at Columbia, here are yearbook photos pic.twitter.com/H7VPHMNT61\n— Laura Rozen (@lrozen) February 1, 2017\nThe Quote: was confirmed by Jocelyn Wilk, an archivist at the Columbia University Archives .\nIt might have been comedy gold to the budding conservative jurist at the time, but the Quote: takes on a slightly different cast as Gorsuch prepares to undergo the intense scrutiny thrust on nominees for the high court, whose job is to determine the constitutionality of government actions.\nWhile Gorsuch dated the Quote: August 29, 1967, the first confirmed use of it was actually Henry Kissinger quoting himself in 1975, when he was secretary of state under President Gerald Ford. He said it during a meeting with Turkish officials, while discussing a U.S. arms embargo on Turkey that Kissinger was apparently unhappy with. In the meeting, a Turkish official suggested working around the ban by moving U.S. arms to Turkey through Europe. The U.S. ambassador flatly deemed the act illegal. Kissinger’s response:\nKissinger was apparently so fond of the Quote: that during his farewell-from-office ceremony, Deputy Secretary of State Charles W. Robinson jokingly called it a Kissinger “principle.”\nWe don’t know why Gorsuch chose the Quote: and cited that date, or how he intended the Quote: to be taken, but then again how many of us would want to be judged by our yearbook Quote: ? We reached out to the White House and Judge Gorsuch for comment and will update with any response we get.", "external_links": ["http://library.columbia.edu/locations/cuarchives.html", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Even", "https://twitter.com/lrozen/status/826644739902550016", "https://t.co/H7VPHMNT61", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.vice.com%2Fstory%2Fneil-gorsuch-scotus-quote", "https://nsarchive.wordpress.com/2012/03/15/document-friday-kissinger-says-the-illegal-we-do-immediately-the-unconstitutional-takes-a-little-longer-but-since-the-foia-im-afraid-to-say-things-like-that/", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1977/01/20/kissinger-oversleeps-on-his-last-day/506f24e8-e6e8-4b4e-bdb7-da0b03ed1903/?utm_term=.7cb6a6e5855f"], "published": "2017-02-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T06:50:03.477+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
