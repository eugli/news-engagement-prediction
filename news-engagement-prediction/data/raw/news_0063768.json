The company has a production space in midtown Manhattan complete with a kitchen. \n“I am very excited to produce dynamic content for the modern audience,” Zakarian said. “I have a passion for discovering new talent as well as continuing to collaborate with established personalities in food, entertainment and lifestyle.” \nZakarian hosts Food Network’s competition series “Cooks Vs. Cons.” He’s also a regular judge on “Chopped” and has been an “Iron Chef” winner. As a restaurateur he’s known for New York’s Lambs Club and National eateries and Atlantic City’s Water Club. \nKey Group is a PR venture founded by New Line Television alum Jaret Keller. Corner Table already produces Zakarian’s SiriusXM series “Food Talk.” \n“The current media landscape has tremendous potential for big ideas and quality storytelling,” said Keller.
