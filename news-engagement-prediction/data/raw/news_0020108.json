It bars citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries -- Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen -- from entering the US for 90 days, all refugees for 120 days and indefinitely halts refugees from war-torn Syria. The order was temporarily blocked by a Seattle Court on February 3 and is now being considered by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.
