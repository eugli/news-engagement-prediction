Reports this season said he intended to sign a five-year, $209 million contract extension with the Kings. \nAfter being traded, whether or not the change of scenery will be good for him, Cousins seemed upset to be leaving Sacramento. During a farewell party Cousins gave a tearful goodbye to the city and its fans in a video captured by Carmichael Dave of KHTK . \n\"My love for this city will never change,\" Cousins said before getting choked up and turning away. \n\"I'm still looking out for these kids,\" he continued. \"Every family in this city matters to me, every soul in this city matters to me. So, everything's the same, I'm just not in a Kings uniform anymore.\" \nThe Pelicans don't play in Sacramento again this season, but when Cousins does return to Sacramento, it seems like he'll receive a warm welcome. \nWatch the tearful goodbye below: My friend got transferred to another city because of his job. He had some things to say.
