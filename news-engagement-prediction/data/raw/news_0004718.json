In fact, Kaepernick exercising his right to protest to protect innocent Americans is as patriotic a gesture possible. Kaep’s reward for his actions? Vilification, death threats and accusations of hating America.. . .”\nDennis recounts Brady’s chummy relationship with the new president, says it reeks of “white privilege.” He adds that Trump made disparaging remarks about former POW Senator John McCain, and said that suicides among returning vets happens among those who “can’t handle it.” Dennis continued that Brady’s Trump endorsement has been ignored when, “in fact, supporting Donald Trump as President of The United States is far more threatening to America than taking a knee during the National Anthem.”\nThe post, which has been up since Jan. 25 on the online site “Medium” was picked up by news sites Breitbart News, formerly run by Trump’s adviser Steve Bannon, Fox News and Huffington Post.\nDennis said that is not his typical reading audience, though with his writings on everything from politics to professional wrestling, he often gets comments, is called a racist or someone who hates America.\nBecause he is associated with Morehouse, it got a threat.\nA statement from Morehouse says an anonymous caller told a school phone operator that he supported Brady and Trump. He said he and his friends lived in Tennessee and would soon be “loading up their guns and coming here for a football game.”\nMorehouse College released a statement saying that no work of an individual faculty member necessarily represents Morehouse’s views, but that it supports it’s staff members freedom to express their views.\nMorehouse Police Chief Valerie Dalton alerted the Atlanta Police Department and the Office of Homeland Security. The adjunct professor, Dennis, is working with police in their investigation of threats called into the campus and posted online.", "external_links": ["https://medium.com/the-crew/tom-bradys-politics-are-far-more-un-american-than-colin-kaepernick-s-have-ever-been-85f4144c6a2e#.djgkd74w8"], "published": "2017-02-03T20:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T08:21:42.780+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
