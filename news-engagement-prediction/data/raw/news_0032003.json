Second, sometimes when people talk to me and say, ‘why don’t you stop? You don’t need to prove nothing anymore,’ and I respond, ‘because this is my heart. Fighting’s my life.’ \n“And when you go inside the cage I’m back to when I was 30 years old, and just happy. And I just stay happy, because this is my life.” \nIt was quite controversial that Silva was awarded the victory in this fight, as Brunson finished with an 118-54 advantage in strikes landed and completed the only two takedowns of the bout. Yet despite this, he lost on all three judge's scoring cards. Even Dana White had the American winning over the Brazilian. \nYet, Silva was the one who came out of UFC 208 victorious, and, with him turning 42 in April, we'll have to wait and see if we ever get to witness arguably the greatest of all time step inside the octagon to fight again. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
