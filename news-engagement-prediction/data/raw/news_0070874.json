Keith Ellison was the progressive favorite, but failed to generate enough support to beat Perez on the second ballot. A small group of Ellison backers booed vociferously in the wake of the results being announced, according to reports from the scene , and many progressives reacted with outrage at the vote.\nJim Dean, chairman of Democracy for America, a progressive political action committee, said Ellison's defeat was another example of the Democrats prioritizing the establishment over the party's grassroots.\n\"This incredible, disappointing result is another missed opportunity for a Democratic Party desperately trying to regain relevance and proves, once again, how out of touch party insiders are with the grassroots movement currently in the streets, on the phone and at town halls nationwide,\" he said.\nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox.\n  Washington Examiner News Alerts.   alert soon! Dean said the Democratic National Committee may not be leaders in working against President Trump 's policies under Perez.\n\"The Resistance will persist in showing progressive leaders how to unrelentingly take on Trump, with or without the leadership of the Democratic National Committee,\" he said.\nIn the environmentalist world, Friends of the Earth Action President Erich Pica was very disappointed by the result.\n\"The DNC is out of touch with the American public and their needs. Democratic leaders were at a crossroads and today they chose to continue the failed Clinton strategy of prioritizing wealthy donors over the activist base,\" Pica said in a statement.\n\"Friends of the Earth Action will continue to advance a strong progressive agenda and hold both parties accountable to it. In the meantime, those of us committed to resisting Trump and his extreme agenda will continue to look outside the Democratic Party for leadership.\"\nAlso from the Washington Examiner For Democrats, a new chairman but still no answers DNC chair Tom Perez must figure out a path back to power for the Democrats.\nBy David M. Drucker • 02/26/17 12:01 AM Our Revolution, the group founded by Sen. Bernie Sanders to further progressive ideals, didn't congratulate Perez on his victory but called for more action.\n\"While the media has been focused on the race for chair, we have been winning elections within state and local parties,\" the statement read.\n\"This would not be possible without the grassroots knocking on doors, making human connections, and bringing people together. This is a product of everyday people fighting for a party that stands up for middle and working class families, not special interest. We must continue this work.\"\nSanders himself called on Perez to ensure the Democratic Party would change after he assumes his post, because the status quo \"is not working,\" he said.\n\"We must open the doors of the party to working people and young people in a way that has never been done before,\" Sanders said. \"Now, more than ever, the Democratic Party must make it clear that it is prepared to stand up to the 1 percent and lead this country forward in the fight for social, racial, economic and environmental justice.\"\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Border agent assaults on the rise in new fiscal year From Oct. 1-Dec. 31, 2016, agents reported 215 assaults, while 97 took place a year ago.\nBy Anna Giaritelli • 02/26/17 12:01 AM  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T23:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T14:38:25.355+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
