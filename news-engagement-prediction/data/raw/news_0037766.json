We urge the Government to make an emergency injection of funds into social care in the Spring Budget.” Age UK Age UK \nThe report said the number of elderly people left with insufficient care has soared 48 percent since 2010. \nIt found 700,000 people struggle with daily living do not receive any help. A further 487,000 receive help but this does not fully meet their needs. \nIn 2015/16, more than half of all requests for elderly social care were not granted. \nMeanwhile the number of beds in residential homes has dropped, and those providing unpaid care have risen. \nAbrahams said: “Some older people and their families are already telling us that they simply cannot find any carers where they live, and we are also hearing of vulnerable older people receiving council-funded care whose help has been significantly reduced, leaving them to manage alone for many hours at a time.” Age UK Requests for elderly care \nA Government spokesperson said: “We recognise the pressures of an ageing population, which is why we are giving local authorities access to £7.6 billion of new money for adult social care. \n“This Government has gone further to integrate health and social care than any other before it. We have brought budgets together for the first time through the Better Care Fund and given the NHS an extra £10 billion per year by 2020/21 to fund its own plan to build a more responsive, modern health system. \n“But this is not solely about money, which is why we are working to find a long-term, sustainable solution which helps local authorities learn from each other to raise standards across the whole system.” More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T07:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T02:30:21.060+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
