A huge chunk of that money will go to automation tech, including some absolutely incredible robot warriors. \nHere are the most impressive battlefield robots that US taxpayer dollars have bought. Photo by: Boston Dynamics Atlas, the military's humanoid robot \nMeet Atlas. Made by Boston Dynamics and funded by DARPA, the 6-foot-tall Atlas is the military's first serious, public effort toward developing a bipedal humanoid robot. \nIt's designed to perform some pretty incredible tasks. Photo by: Boston Dynamics Oops, robot fell down \nThe military wants Atlas to be proficient in a number of search and rescue tasks that include turning valves, opening doors and walking over rubble. \nAnd it wants Atlas to do all of this without clumsily falling over, which, as this picture attests, is easier said than done. Photo by: John Tlumacki/The Boston Globe/Getty Images Seriously, though. Atlas falls a lot \nIn 2015, DARPA held a robotics competition. The challenge: program an Atlas robot that can complete an eight-stage obstacle course. This particular entrant failed at the \"open a door\" phase. Photo by: DARPA Ever seen a robot drive a car? \nWhen Atlas stays upright, though, it can do some pretty amazing things. In this photo, an Atlas programmed by IHMC Robotics drives a utility vehicle during the 2015 DARPA Robotics Challenge. Photo by: DARPA Atlas, The Next Generation \nOf course, clumsy robots are so 2015 . An upgraded version of Boston Dynamic's bot, epically named \"Atlas, The Next Generation,\" was unveiled in 2016. \nAtlas, The Next Generation uses laser imaging (LIDAR), stereo sensors in its head, and more sensors in its limbs to aid with balance and movement. As such, it's a lot less clumsy than the first-generation Atlas, even in snowy test conditions. Photo by: Boston Dynamics A 3D-printed robot \nIn creating the new Atlas, Boston Dynamics used 3D printing to embed hydraulics in its structure, custom tailoring parts to be smaller and more lightweight. As a result, Atlas, The Next Generation stands 5 feet 9 inches (1.8 metres) tall and weighs just 180 pounds (82 kilograms). Photo by: Boston Dynamics A robot with a grenade launcher \nNot all US military robots carry weaponry but this, the Talon Swords, sure does. It's armed with a six-barrel, 40 mm grenade launcher. Other weapons options for the Talon include an M16 rifle, M240 machine gun and M202A1 Flash incendiary rocket launcher. \nTalon robots were deployed in Iraq in 2007, though their weapon systems were never used. Photo by: Spencer Platt/Getty Images The best defense against IEDs \nTalon robots aren't all about offense; the tech is key in dealing with roadside bombs and other improvised explosive devices. \nThe Talon's seven cameras (including thermal- and night-vision) and long-range shield its operator from threat, allowing them to safely identify bombs from as far as 1,000 meters away. Remote-controlled Talons also assisted in the 9/11 recovery effort. Photo by: Spc. Giancarlo Casem That's one way to test a robot's strength \nThe Talon is designed to cross snow, sand, water and drastically sloping terrain, with a top speed of about 5.2 miles per hour (8 km/hr). It's strong, too, with a towing capacity of nearly 750 pounds (340 kg). \n\"We always demonstrate its strength by having the Talon IV latch onto a soldier's gear and pull a prone soldier through a few lanes,\" Army Sgt. 1st Class Rocky Duran said . Photo by: Maj. Penny Zamora/US Army The next generation of heavily armed robots \nThis is the successor to the armed Talon Swords robot, the Modular Advanced Armed Robotic System (MAARS), currently in testing. Like the Talon, MAARS has both lethal (machine guns, high explosives) and non-lethal modules (warning sirens, tear gas). \nThe US Army is hoping to have the 370-pound (167 kg) bots see action within the next few years. Photo by: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images On patrol with a killer robot \nPer the Department of Defense, MAARS robots cannot make an autonomous decision to use lethal force. Only nearby human pilots can make that call. \nThe idea is to limit collateral damage, as the robot's bullets travel much further than its sensors can detect. Field testing the MAARS \nThe Marine Corps has been researching the use of MAARS to provide extra firepower -- and thus, better protection -- for foot patrols. \nLoaded with a M240B machine gun holding 450 rounds and four M203 Grenade Launchers on a 360-degree turret, MAARS is more than up to the task. Photo by: Lance Cpl. Juilen Rodarte/USMC Building the BigDog \nBoston Dynamic's BigDog, seen here, is arguably the most infamous DARPA robot. The 3-foot-long (92 centimeters), 2.5-foot-tall (76 cm) robot animal was designed to traverse challenging terrain while carrying a 340-pound load (154 kg). Photo by: Boston Globe/Getty Images BigDog: Too loud for service \nWhile BigDog was able to cross snowy hills, rubble, coastal terrain and more with skill, the project was discontinued in December 2015 when it was ruled too noisy to use in combat. Photo by: Boston Dynamics LS3: A bigger, better sequel \nThis is the LS3, Boston Dynamic's successor to the BigDog. It's something of a robotic pack mule, designed to operate through human voice command. It can follow a soldier while carrying up to 400 pounds (180 kg) of equipment. \nLS3 prototypes can run as fast as 7 miles per hour (11 km/hr) on flat surfaces, or between 1 and 3 miles per hour on rough terrain (2-5 km). It's also capable of righting itself without human assistance. Photo by: Kyle J. O. Olson/USMC The LS3, up close \nDespite investing $42 million in developing the LS3, the US Marine Corp decided to shelve the project at the end of 2015 because, like the BigDog, the LS3 was just too noisy. \n\"They took it as it was,\" Marine Corps Warfighting Lab spokesperson Kyle Olsen told military.com . \"A loud robot that's going to give away their position.\" Photo by: Boston Dynamics Military robots in World War II \nRemote-controlled battle robots date back to World War II. In that conflict, Germany used Goliath tracked mines , which were 820-pound (370 kg), 5-foot-long (1.5 meter) mini-tanks designed to hold large amounts of explosives. \nThe tech had an easily exploited weakness, however. Cutting the 650-meter-long command cable that connects the bot to its operator rendered it useless. Photo by: US Army Signal Corps The USSR's first robo-tank \nThe USSR, too, developed its own unmanned weapons in the 1930s and '40s. The TT-38 teletank (right) was a radio-controlled assault vehicle piloted by a human inside a TU-38 (left) up to 1,500 meters away. \nThere were at least two Soviet teletank battalions fighting on the Eastern Front of World War II.
