The company had already worked with clubs like Fulham, and top sportsmen like South African rugby legend Bryan Habana and British Olympian Greg Rutherford, before word spread to Egpyt. ‘Obviously team doctors, sports doctors, talk and that’s how we got a foot into Egypt,’ explains Avi Lasarow the company’s founder, who told Sportsmail about the process of compiling information for the Pharaohs to use. ‘We had to run around the world, get permission from all the clubs, then get the samples in the various locations – Belgium, Portugal, Hull, wherever they are. ‘Once you do all the sample collections that goes to our laboratory, where they do analysis and report back to the national team.’ And that analysis can be extremely revealing. ‘If you look at an individual player, we can tell them things like their power/endurance percentage,’ explains Lasarow. The Pharaohs have been working hard in training this weekend ahead of the crunch clash ‘If you come back as a 70 per cent endurance player, then you should have more endurance type training, whether that’s on the pitch, off the pitch, whatever. That’s one variable that we’d work with. ‘Another very important one is your speed of recovery. So for example if you’re a fast recoverer, you would benefit more from actually doing more intense training and not have to be on recovery phase for as long, whereas if we look at another player, he might actually need longer recovery, and the genetics tells us that, so they would get more time off the pitch in our planning. ‘It’s taking all of that into consideration to make sure the plan is designed for their body, as opposed to what they think is right because we’ve assumed for so long that it’s a one size fits all approach.’ The data compiled, DNAFit then pass on the information to Dr Elelaa and his team, who remain in contact with the company’s Egypt office. ‘We had a preparation camp in Egypt, they visited us and we started implementing more and more information,’ says Elelaa. ‘When I’m here in Gabon I have a file for each player, and I’ve started using some of the information.’ But both men are quick to stress that, however successful the Pharaohs have been here, the goal is long-term, not a quick fix. Cameroon stand in the way of Egypt and a possible eighth Africa Cup of Nations title ‘It’s not a one-hit wonder,’ says Lasarow, whose clients range from a top Premier League club, an NHS Trust, and even the military, to members of the public. ‘It’s about education, depth of understanding, a number of aspects over time. So hopefully they’ll win, and it’ll be a great result for us, but if they don’t it’s always been a bigger project.’ ‘It’s not only for this tournament,’ agrees Elelaa. ‘For this tournament I have of course very useful information, but it’s not just a matter for the tournament. It’s regarding not only the national team, it’s regarding the whole of Egyptian football.’ Either way, there is no question that, in the short term, DNA testing is catching the eye of the sporting world. ‘The national teams deploy the information as best they can, but hopefully what will happen over time is other federations, other teams, will say this is the way forward, and eventually it will become the de facto standard,’ says Lasarow. ‘Since we announced the EFA relationship we’ve had other teams who host these players in their club environment reach out to us. ‘They’re interested in learning more. So what we’re doing is pioneering the way forward, it will become the norm over time.’ Egypt's Argentinian head coach Hector Raul Cuper is hoping to lead his men to glory RELATED ARTICLES ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T13:30:33.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
