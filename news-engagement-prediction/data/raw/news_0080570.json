Close Today's top news headlines - February 28 UP NEXT VIDEO Today's top news headlines - February 28 Today's top news headlines - February 28 \nEdwina Cameron went public with the alleged situation at Maclean High School at Grafton in NSW’s mid north and took to social media to complain about a lack of action after a recent influx of flying foxes. \nShe told 7 News Online parents feared for the health of their children, who would often have to endure stinking conditions caused by thousands of the unwelcome residents. \n“It has become more than a health issue... The stench if overwhelming, especially when it's wet,” she said. Three of Edwina Cameron's four children shelter under their school bags. Photo: Supplied \n“It scares me that a child will have to become seriously sick before something is done.” \nShe posted photos to Facebook on Monday of three of her children walking into school with their bags shielding their heads along with shots of the flying foxes in the nearby trees and sky over the school’s car park. \nSeven News Online has contacted Maclean High School and the NSW Department of Education and Training for comment. \nMs Cameron said the lack of action seemed to stem from the fact that the bat’s resided on council own land, outside of the schools control. \nThe school had in the past, she said, conducted dispersal efforts to move the bats on. \nThey are now back though, and in larger numbers after being driven north by bushfires in the state’s south. \n“Teachers and Students live in this environment every day! Lyssavirus, Hendra, salmonella, toxoplasmosis, dead bats, and the overwhelming stench where it takes your breath away!!” Ms Cameron wrote on Facebook above comments from dozens of supporters also demanding action. \nClarence Valley council has established a bat working group to deal with the problem, however, Ms Cameron said the community was now frustrated with its slow progress. \nBut while many are scared of the risks of lyssavirus or hendra, the president of the Australasian Bat Society said the flying foxes were more nuisance than menance. \nDr Justin Welbergen told 7 News Online the risk of hendra virus was extremely low because it could only be spread from bats to horses and then from horses on to humans. Edwina Cameron said there did not appear to be any official numbers but locals estimated the bats number in their tens of thousands. Photo: Supplied \nLyssavirus presented a more likely risk, however, Dr Welbergen said that virus could not be spread by bat droppings. \nHe warned anyone around bats that the risk of lyssavirus came from direct contact with bats and said no one should touch the animals, regardless of whether they were dead or alive.
