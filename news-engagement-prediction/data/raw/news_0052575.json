REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader 4/4 \nVIENNA An Austrian court on Tuesday granted a request by the United States to extradite Ukrainian mogul Dmytro Firtash over bribery allegations. \nThe court in Vienna overturned a previous Austrian court decision to reject the extradition request on the grounds that it was politically motivated. \n\"The (appeal against the previous decision) has been granted,\" the judge told the court packed with journalists and Firtash's family. \"This does not mean that somebody is being pre-judged as guilty, but rather that it will be decided in another country whether they are guilty or innocent.\" \nFirtash, a former supporter of ousted Moscow-friendly president Viktor Yanukovich who made a fortune selling Russian gas to the Ukrainian government, denies the U.S. allegations. \n(Reporting by Shadia Nasralla; Editing by Catherine Evans) Next In World News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:56:14.333+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
