West Des Moines Dowling safety Jack Koerner has changed his mind on his college future. The 6-foot-1, 190-pound Koerner had previously committed to South Dakota, choosing a full ride from the Coyotes over scholarship offers from UNI and South Dakota State.\nBut something kept eating at him as national signing day drew closer this week. That was a chance to play college football at the highest level. So today Koerner decided to turn down his scholarship offers and pursue a walk-on opportunity at Iowa instead.\n‚ÄúI just couldn't pass up the opportunity to be a Hawkeye,‚Äù said Koerner. ‚ÄúI look forward to working hard to become a scholarship player and having a significant role.‚Äù\nIt was not a decision that Koerner took lightly, of course. There were a number of conversations with his family this week, but ultimately they all led to the same conclusion.\n‚ÄúMy parents and I have talked a lot about this obviously and they just want me to be happy and feel satisfied with whatever I choose,‚Äù Koerner said. ‚ÄúBoth my parents are Iowa alums and my whole family‚Äôs huge fans, so they couldn't be more excited that I have this opportunity.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThey want me to be completely happy and if that means turning down offers and having to work a little bit harder for a goal that I have, then that‚Äôs what they want for me.‚Äù\nWith his decision made, Koerner made the coach to Iowa assistant coaches Reese Morgan and Phil Parker to give them the news today.\n‚ÄúCoach Morgan was very pleased when I told him my decision and said that he thinks I have what it takes to be a successful walk-on,‚Äù said Koerner. ‚ÄúCoach Parker shared his evaluation of me and told me about other walk-on guys' success stories and how I could fit right alongside them.‚Äù\nNow, Koerner will set off to make his own success story as he gets ready to report to camp at Iowa this summer.\nExtremely proud to say that I have decided to continue my education and football career at the University of Iowaüê§ pic.twitter.com/HXfDTBntwj\n‚Äî Jack Koerner (@KoernerJack) January 31, 2017 A first team all-state selection, Koerner finished with 44 tackles and five interceptions this past season as he helped Dowling win their fourth straight state title in Class 4A.\nSee highlights from Koerner's senior year in the video below.\nIowa's Class of 2017 walk-ons:\nJack Koerner - 6-foot-1, 190-pound DB from West Des Moines, IA (Dowling)\nJoe Ludwig - 6-foot-2, 205-pound LB from Middleton, WI (Middleton)\nMarshall Coluzzi - 6-foot-0, 215-pound LS from Naperville, IL (North)\nTommy Kujawa - 6-foot-3, 220-pound TE from Greendale, WI (Greendale)\nBryce Schulte - 6-foot-3, 215-pound TE/LB from Cedar Rapids, IA (Xavier)\nCole Hahn - 5-foot-10, 185-pound K from West Des Moines, IA (Valley)\nKeegan Glaus - 5-foot-10, 215-pound LB from Bettendorf, IA (Bettendorf)\nBen Campos - 6-foot-2, 219-pound LB from West Des Moines, IA (Valley)\nTommy Herrion - 6-foot-1, 185-pound QB from Wilmette, IL (Loyola Academy)\nJack Kallenberger - 6-foot-5, 250-pound DE from Bettendorf, IA (Iowa Central)\nNick Easley - 6-foot-0, 204-pound WR from Newton, IA (Iowa Western)\nYale Van Dyne Jr . - 6-foot-3, 205-pound WR from Stilwell, KS (Bishop Miege)\nEdit", "external_links": ["https://res-2.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/jmnvkbwzufn8lt4uuven)", "https://t.co/HXfDTBntwj", "https://twitter.com/KoernerJack/status/826534747019042816", "https://res-2.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/jmnvkbwzufn8lt4uuven"], "published": "2017-01-31T22:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T17:28:17.355+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
