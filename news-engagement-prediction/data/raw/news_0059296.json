Trump spent most of his time from Election Day on Nov. 8 until his inauguration on Jan. 20 at his penthouse apartment in Trump Tower.\nIn addition to the police protection, the Fire Department incurred $1.7 million in costs during the time period Trump was in New York, according to O'Neill.\nOn days when first lady Melania Trump and the couple's son, Barron, are the only ones in the city, security going forward will cost between $127,000 and $145,000 per day, less than when the president is in residence, O'Neill said.\nWhen Trump is in town, the cost of police protection will go back up to $308,000 on average per day, O'Neill said. It will cost about another $4.5 million per year for the New York City Fire Department to protect the building, he said.\n\"We anticipate these costs will increase significantly whenever the president is in New York City,\" he said.\nTrump has not been back to Manhattan since his inauguration.\nNew York Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney said in a statement on Wednesday that the city's taxpayers should not be forced to pay for a \"national security obligation\" and that \"Congress must provide city taxpayers a full reimbursement.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T09:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:03:11.221+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
