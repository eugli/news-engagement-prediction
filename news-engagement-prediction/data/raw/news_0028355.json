Shot in locations all over Mexico, the latest edition of the cooking competition will include a local San Diego chef in the mix — Claudette Zepeda-Wilkins , who cooked at East Village’s Jsix and Sea180 in Imperial Beach before being tapped as chef de cuisine for the high-profile 2015 launch of Bracero Cocina de Raiz in Little Italy. Zepeda-Wilkins parted ways with Bracero last year and has been traveling the country doing pop-up dinners; most recently, she was tapped to lead El Jardin , a new Mexican restaurant from Rise and Shine Restaurant Group that’s slated to open next year in Liberty Station. The show is reportedly still filming, but Zepeda-Wilkins says,“ Top Chef wasone of the most difficult and mentally exhausting experiences of my life. If I was asked to do it again, I'd do it in a heartbeat.” Check out a preview trailer of the cast from Canal Sony Mexico: Ellos avivarán la llama de #TopChefMx . ¿Estás listo para ver subir la temperatura?
