According to new research from the University of South Australia, you might be in for a shock. \nBagheera the cat spends most of her days accepting pats at an Adelaide high school where owner Louise Davy works as a teacher. \nBut it was not until Ms Davy entered Bagheera into a South Australian research project that her nocturnal wanderings were revealed. \n\"I was astonished about where he had gone. He roamed over 20 hectares \" she said. \nIt turned out Bagheera was also a regular night-time visitor to the neighbour's house, where an Australian native garden had a tempting supply of birds. \n\"He was obviously going there in the night time, because they had never seen him,\" Ms Davy said. \nBagheera is one of more than 400 cats whose owners strapped GPS units to their collars for a week as part of the University of South Australia's Cat Tracker project. \nDoctor Philip Roetman from the university's School of Natural and Built Environments said there was no other research like it in the world. \n\"Previous studies have only tracked between 10 and 20 cats, so it has been fascinating to look at this really large sample of data\" he said.

Five feline personality traits identified \nResearchers also identified five major personality factors for pet cats — skittishness, outgoingness, dominance, spontaneity and friendliness. \nThey said the information could be used by owners to make decisions about how to manage their cat. \n\"So, for example, if an owner has a particularly skittish cat, they might decide to provide extra hiding places for their pet, to make the cat more comfortable,\" Dr Roetman said. \nBut that is not something Bagheera had to worry about. He scored high in friendliness and outgoingness. \n\"He is really low in skittishness so he makes the perfect school cat,\" she said. \nResearchers also divided the cats into two main types, \"sedentary\" or \"wandering\". \n\"Those wandering cats that go further, they show more signs of being in fights, they cross more roads, and they bring home more prey, typically,\" Dr Roetman said.

They found widespread support for a cat curfew as well as for micro-chipping. \n\"There was less support for cat registration, so that could be a tricky one,\" Dr Roetman said. \nResearchers are interested in launching a national Cat Tracker program and also want to look at cat diet to see if it has an influence on how far the cats wander. \n\"I'm sure cat owners would love to know if what they are feeding their cat can influence their cat to stay closer to home,\" Dr Roetman said.
