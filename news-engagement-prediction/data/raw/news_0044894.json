President Trump CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nLetter to the editor: \nDo journalism standards require the news media to take the brutal beating President Trump has been dishing out to them for over a year? \nTrump’s diatribe in Melbourne, Fla., on Saturday established a new record of viciousness and depravity by a public figure against the press. He showed no mercy. As usual, he lied and exaggerated, apparently with impunity. Collective media hand-wringing, while broadcasting his venom, is neither a media defense nor adequate retaliation to such behavior. \nIs there a way the press can fight back, for the sake of the public and its own honor, without violating journalistic standards? I believe there is. \nAn adoring national audience is Trump’s lifeline. Take a sizable chunk of it away and he will merely be a tired, old blowhard, with a limited appeal to those who are attending a live performance. Policing the USA \nI’m not suggesting a boycott of his events. The media could do their journalistic duty by providing cameras and reporters for his events. But they could “fight back” by limiting on-air coverage to scanning the crowd to show its size, and a long view of Trump (no sound) addressing it. \nReporters could give a minute or two summary of his repetitious, superfluous remarks, and the station could then return to regular programming. \nI’m also not suggesting an organized news media conspiracy. Each outlet would make its own decisions regarding timing and coverage. Print media would operate in much the same way it does now. \nThis alone will not restore the dignity of the office of the president of the United States. Unfortunately, that will have to be on hold until a dignified person is elected. \nSherman Stock; Hales Corners, Wis. \nFacebook comments are edited for clarity and grammar: \nPresident Trump is the very reason for the First Amendment. Have no doubt, the man is dangerously inept in many ways, but his personal, daily attacks on the free press are gross incompetence for someone who has sworn by oath to protect the Constitution. \n— Chas Holman \nYes, a free press is preferable. But a dishonest, biased and Democratic Party news media are not desirable. The country’s Founders never envisioned a news media that could become so corrupted. \n— Barry VanTrees \nMillions of Americans fought — and thousands died over the past 200 years — to defend freedom of the press, but it took Trump only four weeks to take the dark path toward fascism by calling the press “the enemy of the American people.” When, in fact, the press is only the enemy of the paranoia, the misinformantion and the intentional lies that are spewing from Trump himself. \n— Gary Douglas \nWhen the press endorses a candidate and then slants its news stories in favor of that candidate, that is not providing the facts to the public; it’s controlling the mind of the public. That is wrong and not what the freedom of press intended. To report the news, the press should be required to report all facts and let the public make up its own mind, instead of trying to shape our thoughts. Couple that with the reporters’ rush to be the first one to get the story and you get inaccurate facts. \n— Scott Simpson Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2lolUxl NEVER MISS OUT Opinion Once you know the news, it’s time to understand it.
