George Szell, the autocratic music director of the Cleveland Orchestra, invited him to be a guest conductor. In its review of his debut two years later, The Christian Science Monitor said that Mr. Skrowaczewski’s interpretation of Beethoven’s Leonore Overture No. 3 revealed him as a “leader of warm Slavic temperament,” adding: “His gestures are expansive and expressive, his conceptions highly dramatic and communicative. If his approach to the work was individualistic, at moments surprising, it proved exciting, human and convincing.” But life under Communist rule in Poland was difficult. “It was impossible for musicians and composers,” Mr. Skrowaczewski told ClevelandClassical.com in 2014. “We couldn’t conduct whole areas of contemporary music, including Stravinsky.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The atmosphere in the United States was far more welcoming. He returned in 1959 and was guest conductor in several cities, including Cleveland. He started long relationships on that tour with the New York Philharmonic and the Philadelphia Orchestra. While he was in Cleveland, officials of the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra — the original name of the Minnesota Orchestra — came to watch him lead the orchestra and made him an offer to become its new music director, replacing Antal Dorati . “The problem is he’s in Communist Poland, and he can’t say he’s got this opportunity,” Mr. Harris said. “They wouldn’t let him out.” But he had an engagement in Amsterdam that he was permitted to fulfill in early 1960. He and his wife, the former Krystyna Jarosz, packed two small suitcases, leaving almost everything behind. They left Warsaw by train and headed west. Mrs. Skrowaczewski died in 2011. Mr. Skrowaczewski is survived by his daughter, Anna Skrowaczewski; two sons, Paul and Nicholas; and two grandchildren. As music director of the Minnesota Orchestra, Mr. Skrowaczewski lobbied for construction of a new concert hall. In a documentary based on Mr. Harris’s biography of him, Mr. Skrowaczewski said that after the orchestra played concerts at Carnegie Hall, officials would ask him why it sounded so much better there than at home. He answered that the orchestra played as well in Minneapolis “but you don’t hear it because it’s a bad hall,” adding, “Maybe at that point my fighting for the new hall suddenly brought the change of opinion.” Orchestra Hall opened in 1974 and was praised for its acoustics. Mr. Skrowaczewski endeared himself to the orchestra’s members with his support during a 15 -month lockout that began in 2012. He conducted some of the orchestra’s self-produced concerts and made helpful calls behind the scenes. When the orchestra returned from the lockout in February 2014, Mr. Skrowaczewski led it in its first two concerts. Mr. Wright, the trombonist, said that Mr. Skrowaczewski’s backing of the orchestra during the dispiriting dispute was on his mind when he saw him after one of his final concerts, two years later. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story After a passionate performance, the old maestro, he said, was physically spent. “I just shook his hand and he said, ‘You kept me alive,’ ” Mr. Wright recalled. “And I said, `You kept us alive when we needed you.’ ”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T05:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T01:08:55.823+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
