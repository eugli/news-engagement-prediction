Editor Advertisement \nWhat is wrong with road users on Singapore? Do they think they own the road? Sometimes, does even any sort of common sense left in such people? \nI read with sadness and anger at the news that a motorcyclist died after he collided with an open door of a car. The motorcyclist died on Wednesday night after crashing into a car door, which a passenger opened without warning. The accident happened at at about 9.30pm along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 towards Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 on Wednesday night. What possessed the passenger to open the car door suddenly? In fact, the passenger had even opened the car door twice! \nHis brainless act had caused one death on the road. Police have arrested the man, whose identity was not yet made public. What an idiot! \nSin LH \nA.S.S. Contributor  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T10:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T11:44:10.826+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
