Wine helps. Wine that you can hide in your purse and pour at the touch of a button helps even more. \nBella Vita’s PortoVino leather wine purse is exactly what you think it is: a tote that you can secretly fill up with wine and take with you on the go. (You can actually fill it with anything, but let’s be real, it’s probably going to be wine.) \nThis $74.95 genius necessity comes in three colors and can hold up to 1.5 liters of wine in a refillable, insulated bag. What’s more? The tote’s spout is hidden until you pull it out to pour. \nIt’s perfect for the beach, a picnic, seeing “Fifty Shades Darker,” or any time someone in your family starts talking politics. \nNot into booze? Delish even suggests filling it up with ranch dressing , because nothing is worse than getting stuck sans salad dressing, right? \nHead to Bella Vita to purchase.
