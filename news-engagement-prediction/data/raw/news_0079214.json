From A-listers snapping selfies with fans at the bar to nominees taking political stands, here are just a few fun highlights of what you didn't get to see on Sunday: PHOTOS: Oscars 2017: See the Stars at All the Parties! All the ACLUnity A post shared by ACLU (@aclu_nationwide) on Feb 26, 2017 at 3:02pm PST A number of big stars and Oscar nominees took a strong political stance at the Academy Awards, rocking blue ribbons in support of the American Civil Liberties Union. Lin-Manuel Miranda, Ruth Negga and Karlie Kloss were some of the stars who showed their support on the red carpet and during the show. A post shared by Insta_TopFashion (@insta_topfashion) on Feb 26, 2017 at 5:38pm PST Working Hard or Hartley Working? The This Is Us star Justin Hartley attended the Oscars this year, and he made sure to have some fun with the photographers. The actor posed for pics and joked around with the press photographer in between shots. Hartley also graciously stopped and snapped some selfies with his fans. School's Out The 8-year-old star of Lion , Sunny Pawar, had a super fun Oscars ceremony. The young actor hung out with his dad all night -- where they hit up the bar for Diet Coke and waters -- while a slew of stars and Hollywood pros came up to excitedly meet the adorable scene stealer. \"Everyone PLEASE stop hugging and picking me up\" - Sunny Pawar, probably #Oscars pic.twitter.com/c2GvltkFxe WATCH: 2017 Golden Globes: The Best, Worst and Weirdest Moments A Wolf in Chef's Clothing Celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck, who cooked and catered the dining options for the glamorous event, made sure to play the part by walking around and mingling with the A-list guests dressed in his full chef's gear.

Kloss hung out with some friends by the bar and, after ordering a tequila on the rocks with grapefruit, the group toasted the big night. Kloss thanked her pals for inviting her, adding, \"This is awesome!\" A post shared by Karlie Kloss (@karliekloss) on Feb 26, 2017 at 3:36pm PST Big Bang Small Talk Big Bang Theory star Jim Parsons took a break from the festivities to order a cocktail at the orchestra bar and chat with his fellow industry insiders. Parsons also posed for pics with fans who walked by, and lamented missing this year's Super Bowl due to his shooting schedule. \"Can't Stop the Feeling\" An hour and a half after Justin Timberlake opened up this year's show with a super fun, energetic rendition of his Oscar-nominated hit song, the performer stopped by the bar for a Vodka and soda with a splash of lemon and lime. After posing for some selfies with other Oscar guests, Timberlake helped one woman feel better after she spilled her drink, telling her \"You‚Äôre OK, dear.\" A few minutes later, his wife, Jessica Biel, joined him at the bar with her own glass of bubbly. Chance Encounters Toward the end of the night, Amy Adams departed to make her way to the Vanity Fair after-party. The five-time Oscar nominee ran into Chris Evans on her way out and told him about her evening plans, but it seems Evans wasn't ready to head out of the show just yet.
