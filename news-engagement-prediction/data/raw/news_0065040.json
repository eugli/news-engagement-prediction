Close Two men lead Victoria police on pursuit through Melbourne UP NEXT VIDEO Two men lead Victoria police on pursuit through Melbourne \nThe pursuit ended early Thursday morning with one man arrested, while his accomplice remained on the run, police said. \n\"I was just getting a coffee and he's come flying past me so I got in the car and started chasing him down Mansfield Street [Berwick],\" Chris Murrin told 7 News. Chris Murrin followed the allegedly stolen car in his Toyota HiLux and managed to bump it in attempt to stop it, before police arrived. Picture: 7 News The white Barina was seen driving on footpaths and the wrong way down the highway during the two-hour pursuit. Picture: 7 News \nThe excavator said he heard an alert on the radio about 6am of a Holden Barina being involved in a pursuit, and knew the one flying past him had to be the vehicle police were looking for. \nHe said he called triple-0 and started following the \"erratic\" car in his Toyota HiLux as he could see no police in the area at the time. \n\"I got up behind him and he went to dart off at the last second so I clipped the back of him and spun him around and he's taken off the other way. \n\"I just wanted to get him. I'm sick of what's going on around here so I thought I'd get the b d, but he got away.\" \nMr Murrin said the driver mounted the footpath in a built up residential area, so he didn't want to try and hit him a second time as it was dark and he feared the other car may have lost control and ended up in someone's house. Police allege the men had attempted to steal money from a Berwick car wash cash machine before the pursuit.
