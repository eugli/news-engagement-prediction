I wanted to see the card to see the card.\" \nIn an odd twist the best picture presenter, actor Warren Beatty, refused to show anyone the card before showing it directly to Jenkins. \"Everybody was asking and he was like 'No, Barry Jenkins has to see the card I need him to know.'\" \nAfter Jenkins saw the official card with \"Moonlight\" printed on the paper the director felt better about what happened. \n\"I will say that the folks from 'La La Land' were so gracious,\" Jenkins admitted. \"I can’t imagine being in their position and having to do that. I wasn’t speechless because we won. I was speechless because it was so gracious of them to do that. The card said: 'Best Picture: Moonlight.'\" \nJenkins refuses to be too negative about the confusion, \"It's unfortunate that things happened the way they did, but hot damn, we won best picture.\" Latest updates", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T13:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T08:58:25.922+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
