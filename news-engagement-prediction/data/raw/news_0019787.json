Claudio Ranieri and Steve McClaren made a total of 18 changes between them, prioritising Premier League survival and a Championship play-off push, meaning that those who had the misfortune of watching were rewarded with a second-rate contest.\nA penny for the thoughts of Greg Clarke, the FA chairman and a Leicester supporter, who looked on from the stands on a bitterly cold evening as two East Midlands rivals went through the motions. Ranieri, who was preoccupied with Sunday’s crunch game at Swansea City, saw Leicester take the lead courtesy of Andy King’s header only for Derby to force extra-time through Abdoul Camara’s deflected shot.\nThat additional period, which was the last thing either manager wanted, ended with Leicester securing their place in the fifth round and a trip to Millwall on Saturday week after Wilfred Ndidi came off the bench to register his first goal for the club with a superb 25-yard left-footed shot and Demarai Gray, slaloming his way through the Derby defence, added an excellent third.\nLeicester City 3-1 Derby County (aet): FA Cup fourth-round replay – as it happened Read more \nIt was a strange evening and clear from the outset that what we were watching was effectively a reserve game. Kasper Schmeichel, Danny Simpson, Wes Morgan, Robert Huth and Jamie Vardy did not even make the Leicester bench on a night when Ahmed Musa was the sole survivor from the team that lost 3-0 at home against Manchester United on Sunday .\nWith that in mind, it was tempting to wonder what was going through the mind of Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, the Leicester owner, who had travelled the best part of 10,000 kilometres to watch a fourth-round FA Cup replay that felt totally meaningless.\nSrivaddhanaprabha’s main motive, in fairness, was to show some public support to Ranieri on the back of the statement that was released the previous day, insisting that the Italian had the club’s “unwavering support” amid mounting speculation about his future.\nThe Leicester fans made a gesture of their own after five minutes, when Ranieri’s name reverberated around the stadium. Stood on the edge of his technical area, the 65-year-old responded with polite applause and for a split-second it felt like everyone had travelled back in time to last season. Then it was back to reality. Ranieri had clearly taken the view that he could not afford to risk any injuries ahead of the game at the Liberty Stadium. An alternative take would be that the out-of-form players who were rested could have benefitted from a Cup tie that presented an opportunity to pick up some much-needed confidence.\nEither way, the wholesale changes did not make for much of a spectacle, especially with McClaren also picking his side with one eye on the league. The tie badly needed an early goal to bring it to life, yet there was no sign of a breakthrough in an opening 45 minutes that produced a couple of penalty appeals and little else.\nLeicester were left feeling aggrieved on both occasions and they certainly seemed to have a strong case when Jason Shackell brought down Musa after Jonathan Christie, the Derby goalkeeper, put Richard Keogh under pressure on the edge of his own area with a poor pass. Bartosz Kapustka, a 20-year-old Polish winger who was making his first Leicester start, dispossessed Keogh and it was a clumsy challenge from Shackell that halted Musa’s progress. Keogh was playing with fire on the second incident, when he nudged Ben Chilwell in the back, yet Mike Jones, the referee, refused to point to the spot.\nOtherwise there was little to shout about. Ikechi Anya looked lively on the Derby left while Demarai Gray created Leicester’s best moment in the first half, when the winger delivered an inviting low cross from the right that Musa, stretching every sinew, was unable to touch home.\nKing proved more reliable at the start of the second half. In truth, the Welshman could not miss when Marc Albrighton, climbing above Max Lowe, nodded Gray’s deep centre back across goal. With Mitchell left stranded after scampering across his line to follow the flight of the ball, King headed into the empty net from inside the six-yard box and finally there was something to cheer.\nThe onus was now on Derby to show some attacking adventure. Ron-Robert Zieler, who clawed Jacob Butterfield’s angled drive around the post in the first half, repelled another shot from distance, this time from Camara, not long after King’s goal. The Leicester keeper could do nothing, however, to prevent Camara’s next effort from finding the net after the winger’s low 22-yard shot took a huge deflection off Chilwell, leaving the German wrong-footed.\nBack came Leicester. King, with a glancing header that drifted just wide, came close to a late winner and Mitchell was fortunate to escape a red card for a clear handball outside the area when Musa burst through. Then Lowe chested the ball against his own upright.\nFA Cup Leicester City Derby County match reports Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T05:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:46:30.107+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
