That would negate the need for arming.\"​ \nFormer Labour Party president and political commentator Mike Williams said O'Connor had been perceived as conservative because of his stance on firearms, but he had simply been acting in accordance with the wishes of police union members. \nHe was not economically right-wing and was a \"good solid Labour person\". \nWilliams said O'Connor had been working hard to shift perceptions that he was right-wing. \n\"It will take a while but the public will get to like him.\" \nO'Connor has been contacted for comment. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T07:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T02:46:48.415+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
