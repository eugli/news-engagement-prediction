And when she expresses her discomfort with this, he becomes passive aggressive with his fiancee. \nRhona has been feeling doubts over her wedding as she and her future husband have disagreed several times over his approaches. Fans have been watching with horror as his menacing and controlling behaviour has hacked away at Rhona’s confidence and things also came to a head when he forced himself on her when she made it clear that she didn’t want to have sex. \nHowever, Rhona tries to put her fears over the wedding to rest and after a chat with a well meaning Laurel, Rhona decides to set a date – for just six weeks time. (Picture: ITV) \nLater, the mood is light between Rhona and Pierce as they joke around with underwear and, despite Vanessa Woodfield harbouring and expressing huge concerns about Pierce, Rhona dismisses the worrying signs. \nAs she does a strip tease for Pierce, she is uneasy as a delighted Pierce grabs the tablet and records her. What she doesn’t know is that he is keeping the camera running when they go on to have sex. (Picture: ITV) \nWhen Rhona later finds out about the footage, she is unhappy but rather than apologise and delete the video, Pierce has a go at her and accuses her of being ashamed of their intimacy. Not wanting to upset Pierce, Rhona tells him not to delete it, despite her feelings around it. \nHowever, the video could soon be the source of a whole new nightmare for Rhona when Pierce vengefully orchestrates it so that Vanessa comes across the footage. (Picture: ITV) \nWhat is he planning in order to get back at Vanessa for her warnings over him to Rhona – and how might it affect Rhona? \nOne to watch: Thursday 9th March at 7pm on ITV.
