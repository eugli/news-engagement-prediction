It then crashed into the rear of DFO Essendon, near the Spotlight and Focus on Furniture shops. \n“He told me about this wonderful trip all set up with all his friends,” Mrs Wicht said during a video interview. \nMr De Haven, 70, was a former FBI agent and US army veteran who “liked to keep active”. \n“He loved the water, loved being outside, trained for a long time to be in a triathlalon.” \nShe said he didn’t like being in the limelight, and was “well-liked, sarcastic, funny and just a really lovely guy”. \n“He was steady. Someone you could always count on.” \nIt was one of Mr De Haven’s children who called Ms Wicht to pass on the “surreal” news that her brother was among the five people killed in the crash. \n“My heart is broken. That’s how both my sister and I feel. He was our big brother.” Greg De Haven, 70, was a former FBI agent and US army veteran. (Supplied) \nShe said her thoughts were with his wife, Laurie, who is now in the care of the US consulate. \n“It’s really really difficult for all of them and my heart goes out to my dear sister in law and the rest who were all on this trip.” \nMs Wicht also said Mr De Haven’s death will be “so hard” on his three children, and six grandchildren. \n“They were all together at Christmas time. \n“I’m sure that was a blessing they had that time together before he was gone.” © Nine Digital Pty Ltd 2017 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T14:33:22.909+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
