(Getty Images) Australia's Aaron Mooy was once again at the heart of the action as Huddersfield Town recorded a sixth consecutive Championship win with a 1-0 home victory over play-off rivals Reading that boosted their automatic promotion hopes. Source: Tweet \nHaving held Manchester City in the FA Cup on Saturday, David Wagner's side continued their impressive form and cut the gap to second-placed Brighton and Hove Albion. \nMooy created three chances, had 71 touches and made five tackles and two interceptions in the 1-0 victory. \nElsewhere, Aussie Jackson Irvine went off with a groin injury during Burton Albion's 0-0 draw with Derby County. #BAFC coach Andy Garner confirmed post-match that @jirvine36 had a groin issue. Groin problem kept Irvine out for a few weeks in Jan. \n— Ashley Wilkinson (@AshWilkinsonBM) February 21, 2017 \nFellow top-six side Sheffield Wednesday suffered a 2-1 defeat at home to Brentford, who lost Josh McEachran to a serious looking injury. \nIt was a result that Derby County failed to take advantage of as they were held by Burton Albion, while QPR, where Massimo Luongo was an unused substitute, beat relegation-threatened Wigan Athletic. \nPHILIP TAKES TOP BILLING \nThe Terriers had to be patient in their pursuit of a victory that leaves them four points behind Brighton and five shy of leaders Newcastle United. \nIt was Philip Billing who grabbed the winner eight minutes from time after some hesitant Reading defending. \nThe defeat ended Reading's six-game unbeaten run and next up for them is a trip to Brighton. \nBEES STING OWLS \nWhile their Yorkshire rivals were staking a claim for a top-two spot, Wednesday's own Premier League ambitions suffered a blow. \nA win would have moved them 10 points clear of seventh-placed Norwich, but some slack set-piece defending cost them dear for both of Brentford's goals in the first half. \nAnd so Fernando Forestieri's late curler was merely a consolation as their four-game winning streak came to a halt. \nThe Bees' Hillsborough triumph was somewhat overshadowed by McEachran being forced off on a stretcher before the interval. \nOUT FOR THE COUNTY? \nDerby's last two games before the visit of Burton had seen them score six goals and concede seven, so naturally it ended 0-0 on Tuesday. \nThe result moved them a point closer to the play-off spots courtesy of Wednesday's loss, but the 10-point gap looks sizeable for a side who have not won in four matches. \nFor the Brewers it was a point nearer to safety, with 22nd-placed Wigan losing 2-1 at QPR.
