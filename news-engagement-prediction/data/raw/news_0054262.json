Using stick-on crystals it makes a woman’s private area temporarily glisten and sparkle. While it might sound rather complicated, it's relatively easy to do at home if you pick a simple design. However, you can let your creativity run wild. And if it's not for you, not to worry. It's only temporary and very easy to remove. \nJennifer Love Hewitt got this done and fell in love with the shine talking openly about her experience in her book The Day I Shot Cupid referring to her lower region as a 'disco ball'. We walk you through the steps to getting sparkly at home, from mega bling to a simple shine. \nDifficulty: Easy \nTime Required: 5 - 10 minutes or more depending on the type of design desired \nHere's How: \nHair removal .

Are you going to put on a pre-made design or use separate crystals to create a custom one? ( Get design suggestions .) \nGet crystals and/or gems . These companies ( see products ) have a vast selection of individual crystals and pre-made designs like letters of the alphabet, hearts, cupcakes and more. Your local craft store may also have stick-on crystals that can be applied on the body. \nClean and dry skin . When you're ready to go wash the area with soap and water and pat skin dry. Use a pre-wax cleanser or alcohol to remove all oils. Do not apply any lotion. \nApply crystals . On a hairless area, follow the specific directions from the manufacturer for the application. Basically, if it's a design with the crystals stuck to each other, just peel and place. If the crystals are separated but have a design in place carefully take them off them from the sheet and gently remove any clear backing to reveal sticky adhesive. Firmly press to your skin for about 10 seconds or more. If you would rather use crystals individually, apply with clean tweezers. \nSeal . Bindi glue , spirit gum or clear eyelash adhesive ( compare prices on Amazon ) can be used on the skin for extra staying power. Take a small cotton swab or soft, clean paint brush and apply a tiny amount of product on top and to the sides of each crystal. Be sure to keep on the outside of your body only. \nYou’re finished . It’s best to let the vajazzle design set for about 10 minutes or so before putting on panties or pants. \nRemoval . Gently peel off skin when you want the design gone. \nTips: A pre-made design is easier to apply than using individual crystals to get the design even. Be careful applying to freshly waxed or shaved area because the adhesive could aggravate skin. Exactly how long you need to wait depends on your skin type. It’s best to keep the design on the top part of the pubic mons (the area above your clitoris up to the upper most hair line) and not by the labia. You could take off part of the design when using the restroom. Vajazzling is very temporary. The design will stay on a little bit longer when sealed. Don't use any lotions or oils on your bikini zone and be careful when showering and going to the bathroom. Depending on the crystals, you may be able to re-use them again once more by using bindi glue or spirit gum as an adhesive and a sealant. \nWhat You Need: Temporary body crystals or gems Clear spirit gum, bindi glue or eyelash adhesive Pointed tweezers (for individual crystals) Cotton swabs or small soft painting brush", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T05:45:10.807+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
