Victoria has been across the pond working on her latest collection for New York Fashion Week. With her runway presentation scheduled for Sunday it's no doubt been a busy time for the star, who has come under fire from fans for pushing her brand amid her husband's email scandal. A good sport: Victoria still managed to look incredible in her low-key choice of attire, wearing the brand's trademark tracksuit pants and the iconic shell-toe trainers Wrapped up: She teamed it with a simple white top and kept out the cold wearing a black coat which was buttoned up at the front It's all going on: With a full face of make-up, she hid her eyes behind a dark pair of designer shades as she prepared for her busy week ahead As she tried to focus on her own business by sharing products from her Spring/Summer collection on Monday, the backlash turned on her - with critics slamming her for her husband's emails and for using slim models. After sharing an image of her collection, one angry tweeter wrote: 'Anorexic chic was so yesterday!' Another user accused the former Spice Girl of arrogance, adding: 'u had a 'small' girl band a 100 yrs ago get over it. u r by no means a rock or any legend. move on honey. arrogant (sic).'

(sic)' One quipped: 'Tell David its about time people can now see what he is really like. He stopped becoming a footballer when he met you.' In the leak, David reacted angrily when he found out he had been passed over for a knighthood. The former England captain branded the Honours Committee ‘unappreciative c***s’ and dismissed lower awards, ranting: ‘Unless it’s a knighthood f*** off’. According to the revelations, the Honours Committee had already agreed that Beckham's nomination – almost certainly proposed by his PR advisers – was well 'merited' before a routine check of his tax affairs. The leaked emails also include a number of bombshells and series of sweary-rants and may even have been used as part of a £1million blackmail plot. In one message the ex-England captain allegedly claims singer Katherine Jenkins, 36, got an OBE for ‘singing at the rugby and going to see the troops plus taking coke. F g joke’.
