Close Two boys climb on to juvenile jail for at least eight hours UP NEXT VIDEO Two boys climb on to juvenile jail for at least eight hours \nPrison staff are demanding a maximum security facility for radical juveniles so that offenders like the 16-year-old in question aren’t influenced by the likes of two other teenagers accused of plotting an Islamic State terrorist act in Sydney. \nStaff at the besieged Cobham Juvenile Correctional Centre in Werrington, in Sydney’s west reprimanded the boy when he spat on one officer and assaulted another as he refused to return to his cell, News Corp reports. \nPublic Service Association general secretary Stewart Little has called for a Supermax-type facility to be built for particularly high-risk youths. The Cobham Juvenile Justice Centre in western Sydney, has been riddled with controversy in recent years. Source: AAP The assault took place at the same juvenile centre where two detainees climbed on the roof and remained there for nine hours in August last year. \n“You’ve got juveniles who have been charged with terror-related offences and they’ve got tactical response units escorting them to and from court,” Mr Little told News Corp. \n“Yet when they go back into the juvenile facility they’re back in the general population.\" \nWhen police came to interview the teenager the following day, he threatened to behead an officer, prompting prison staff to remove him from the room. \nAs they escorted him back to his own room, he kicked the door, hitting an officer in the head. \nThe officer required six stitches as a result of the injury he sustained in the incident. \nThe boy has no known links to existimists and has not been charged with terror offences.
