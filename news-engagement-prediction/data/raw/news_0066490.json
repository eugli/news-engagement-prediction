Worth remembering that as this Trump/media hysteria rages,\" he posted on Twitter. \nInstituting scathing attacks on former US president Barack Obama one after the other, Morgan replied to a few, who commented on the previous tweet, and held Obama responsible for Trump`s nerve to target the media. \nMorgan`s defence of Trump came hours after the White House blocked several news organisations - CNN, the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, Politico and BuzzFeed - from an off-camera press briefing. \nThe administration, however, defended its move, citing they had `the pool there, so, everyone would be respresented and get an update`. \nEarlier, Trump had mocked the news media at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). He said that much of the press represents \"the enemy of the people.\" First Published: Saturday, February 25, 2017 - 09:05 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T05:44:01.723+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
