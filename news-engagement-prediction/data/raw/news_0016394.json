That was no way to treat another human being. Your journey was terrible,\" said Bellew in an email addressed to Tan on Monday.    \nBellew quipped how modern jet aircraft are poorly designed to accommodate disabled customers.    \n\"I personally will now review the safety of how we speed these exits from our aircraft,\" said Bellew.    \nHe wrote that he can \"say sorry all day\", but it won't help Tan.    \n\"A more constructive approach I think would be to meet with you in person and members of national organisations that represent people with mobility challenges.    \n\"There has to be a better way to help you,\" said Bellew.    \nBellew requested to meet with Tan at his home or to organise a meeting in Kuala Lumpur.    \nHe also talked about his goal to make MAS \"the pride of the nation again\".    \n\"We are adopting right now a Golden Rule ... Treat other people as you wish to be treated yourself,\" said Bellew.    \n\"Mr Tan, I promise you I will work hard to get that Golden Rule in operation throughout Malaysia Airlines.    \n\"Hopefully we can work together to use the Golden Rule to create a new and better way for our disabled customers to see that the journey itself is the reward,\" he said.    \nTan shared Bellew's email reply on his Facebook page Tuesday, which led to several netizens praising Bellew's prompt response.    \n\"Peter Bellew responded like a true human being, kudos to him. There may yet be hope for MAS if his positive attitude can spread through the ranks of a morally disgruntled staff,\" said Facebook user Antares Maitreya.    \nAnother commenter, Eelynn Tan, complimented Bellew for acknowledging the blunder and for taking steps to rectify the problem.    \n\"I'm glad Peter Bellew replied you personally and I truly hope that his pledge and promises come true! It's at least a step in the right direction,\" said another Facebook user Leonard Lim.    \nFacebook user Mastura Mahamed said she will \"follow this case closely\" and hopes that \"real action\" will be taken by MAS management.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T13:07:25.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
