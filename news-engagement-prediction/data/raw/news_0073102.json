(Photo: Jack Kurtz/The Republic) \n251 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 8 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Immigrant-rights activists scored a victory Tuesday when the Arizona Senate rejected a bill that would have prevented Phoenix from creating a city identification card available to all residents, regardless of their immigration status.\nSome Republican lawmakers have pushed, for the second consecutive year, to block the city from moving forward with an ID-card program that could provide thousands of residents, including undocumented immigrants, with a new form of government identification.\nSupporters say the card would help many residents who struggle to obtain valid IDs by making it easier for them to do things like open a bank account, report crimes, use city programs and volunteer at their children's schools.\nThe Senate voted 17-13 on Tuesday to reject a bill that would have prevented Arizona cities, towns and counties from launching local ID-card programs unless their screening processes are as stringent as those required for a non-operating license from the Motor Vehicle Division.\nThat would have blocked anyone who cannot prove legal immigration status from receiving a card. Four Republicans and all the Democrats voted \"no.\"\nAn issue of identity theft? The bill's sponsor, Sen. John Kavanagh, R-Fountain Hills, said the issue was about identity theft, not illegal immigration. He said Phoenix's program, which does not mirror MVD license requirements, would help criminals hide their true names.\n\"This is an issue of people who want to assume false identities to defraud people, wanted felons who want to create new identities,\" Kavanagh said prior to the defeat. \"We don't want to give them government ID to help them in their schemes or their evasion of justice.\"\nPhoenix officials have said they are not attempting to create a primary ID, like a driver's license or birth certificate. Rather, the city ID would be a secondary form of identification, similar to a bank card or employee badge issued by a private entity.\nViri Hernandez, a Mexican immigrant and coordinator of the One Phx ID coalition, said municipal IDs have not created identity-theft problems in other cities that have them. Several large cities — New York, San Francisco and Oakland — have made municipal IDs available regardless of immigration status.\n\"I think that people really just saw that this was an anti-immigrant bill,\" Hernandez said after the vote. \"Some legislators on both sides are just tired of that.\"\nPhoenix leaders voted last year to create the municipal ID program at the urging of immigrant-rights groups.\nBut the cards aren't just for undocumented immigrants. Supporters say it will make it easier for other residents to get ID, including people who are homeless — who don't have a permanent address — and transgender residents, who could select the gender of their identity.\nPhoenix had expected to begin issuing the cards on Feb. 1, but officials delayed the rollout given that state legislation could block implementation of the program as designed.\nHernandez also was critical of the city for delaying the ID program. She said city leaders have not done enough to protect vulnerable immigrants and could have launched the ID card \"by now if it was truly a goal.\"\nShe said her coalition isn't currently supporting the city's ID program because they believe Phoenix hasn't done enough to oppose President Donald Trump's policies and end collaboration with federal immigration authorities. Hernandez said she's concerned cardholder data could be shared with the federal government.\n'Protecting local control' The effort to block Phoenix from launching the ID-card program may not be over.\nAnother measure, House Bill 2086, also is working through the Legislature. It would ban cities and towns from issuing municipal ID cards, and any locality that violates the law could lose shared tax revenues from the state.\nThat bill, sponsored by Rep. Jay Lawrence, R-Scottsdale, was approved by the House and now goes to the Senate for consideration. However, the bill will face a steep challenge in the Senate given it is more restrictive than the city-ID measure rejected on Tuesday.\nJohn Wayne Gonzales, a government liaison for the city, said Phoenix opposes both bills this session because they infringe on city leaders' ability to make laws at the local level, and noted that Mayor Greg Stanton and a majority of the City Council support the ID-card effort.\n\"Basically, it all comes down to our message of protecting local control,\" Gonzales said after the vote.\nRELATED: Phoenix council denies 'sanctuary city' request \nAdvocates of the ID card, dubbed the \"One Phx ID,\" have said the card would also improve public safety because undocumented immigrants would be more willing to talk with police. Some say they have not reported violent crimes in the past because they were afraid a police officer would demand identification.\nThe card would list biometric information such as height, weight and hair and eye color.\nIn addition to being a secondary form of ID, Phoenix's card would function as a city library card, and the city hopes to eventually link other services, such as recreation centers and golf courses. That could take two to three years.\nRELATED: \nHow Trump administration's memo differs from previous orders to deploy Guard to Arizona border\nU.S. accelerates deportation of Haitian migrants\nWhy didn't deported Arizona mom apply for U.S. citizenship?\nDeported Arizona mom: Victim or convicted felon?\nMyth or fact? 5 surprises on unauthorized immigration", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:39:39.219+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
