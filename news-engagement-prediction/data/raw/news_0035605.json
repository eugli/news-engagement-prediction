By Ron Dicker \nSara Ramirez , who is bisexual and played a bisexual surgeon on “ Grey’s Anatomy ,” had a bone to pick with “The Real O’Neals.” \nThe actress blasted the sitcom Thursday over a Jan. 17 episode in which a gay character played by Noah Galvin likened bisexuality to having “webbed toes” or “money problems,” several outlets noted. \nThe 41-year-old actor, who came out last October, implored network ABC and “The Real O’Neals” on Twitter to “own” and “address” the issue and empower LGBTQ youth with “ accurate positive reflections.” \nRamirez said she’s “disappointed” in the network for which she worked for 10 years on the doctor drama. She left the show in May. “I will invest my brand where I’m respected,” she wrote.

A PFLAG spokeswoman said that the group “blew it” for not catching the comment earlier. \nBut in another tweet Ramirez called for a network response. \nThe actress also encouraged followers to sign a change.org petition protesting the show. And as someone who worked 4 them 4 10 years+,am truly disheartened & disappointed quite frankly.I will invest my brand where I'm respected. https://t.co/NQQAPDsFlU — Sara Ramirez (@SaraRamirez) February 16, 2017 Dear @ABCNetwork @TheRealONeals :own it,address it,clarify it,empower our #Queer #Bisexual youth & community w/accurate positive reflections — Sara Ramirez (@SaraRamirez) February 16, 2017 & while @PFLAG response was amazing,where is network's response?The actor's response wasn't enough 4 me. @ABCNetwork was in the same room. https://t.co/AwjPWPJk5B", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T19:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T14:54:02.320+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
