(ABC News: Avani Dias) \nFurther south, the US has operated the secretive joint defence facility Pine Gap at Alice Springs since the 1980s. \nEach year US Marines rotate through the Top End, with 1,250 involved last year as part of a 2011 agreement signed between the former prime minister Julia Gillard and president Barack Obama, emphasising the close military ties between the two countries. \nThat figure is set to double in the next few years, as the Territory becomes a small but critical piece of the US's pivot to Asia amid growing tensions over disputed territory in the South China Sea. \nDr Blaxland said while there was \"a fair degree of assurance\" the current arrangement with US troops in Darwin would remain, \"in terms of the US posture in South East Asia and the region more broadly there's enormous uncertainty\". \n\"We don't know what the implications of President Trump's speeches, tweets are in terms of applied policy when it comes to the application of force in our neighbourhood,\" he said. \n\"Does this mean the US administration will take a more confrontational approach towards China, say, in the South China Sea? \n\"If that's the case that has potential to have significant consequences in the neighbourhood; there'll be considerable pressure on Australia to participate and to facilitate that engagement.\" NT businesses compete for Defence dollars \nLocal businesses are buckling up for a boom with Defence spending tipped to exceed $8 billion over the next decade. \nTracy Ryan from local welding company A&B Welding is just one of those who hopes to win a contract. \n\"That's all the talk at the moment; Defence is spending billions of dollars,\" she said. \nBut Territory businesses should expect \"to work very hard\" to get Defence contracts, Brian O'Gallagher from the NT Chamber of Commerce said. \n\"There's no guarantees all this work is going to come to local business, I think the Government needs to move stronger on this,\" he said. \nHe said the primary industry sector was worth about $550 million to the NT economy, and estimated the corresponding government department was about 300-people strong. \n\"Defence could potentially be $8 billion over a decade and we probably have a small unit of 3-4 people,\" Mr O'Gallagher said. \nChief Minister Michael Gunner said he would work hard to help local businesses seize the opportunity of Defence contracts over the coming years. \n\"I'll be in Canberra, knocking on doors, I will be opening them, and sometimes as the Chief Minister I can open doors the private sector can't,\" Mr Gunner said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T09:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T04:54:26.171+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
