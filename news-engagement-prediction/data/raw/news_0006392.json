More on this story Why is the Supreme Court so important? Can Democrats block the nomination? \nRepublicans would cry foul over a concerted effort to block Judge Gorsuch's confirmation, but it was the Republicans who blocked Barack Obama's nomination for the seat until Mr Obama left office. \nJustice Scalia's seat became available 10 months before the end of Mr Obama's presidency, but Republicans refused even to debate his pick of Judge Merrick Garland, claiming it was too close to an election. \nEven if Judge Gorsuch makes it through the Senate Judiciary Committee, he will face challenges when the entire chamber convenes for a final vote. \nDemocrats may seek to prevent that second vote by prolonging, or filibustering, the debate. In that case, the nomination would need 60 votes rather than a simple majority. \nWith Republicans only holding 52 Senate seats, they may have to change Senate rules in order to approve Mr Trump's nominee. Media caption The Supreme Court has been without a full bench for almost a full year Where does Judge Gorsuch stand on key issues? \nAbortion: He has not spoken out about Roe v Wade, the case which legalised abortion nationwide in 1973, making in difficult to pin down where he stands on the issue. \nBirth control: Judge Gorsuch has supported religious institutions which objected to requirements for employers to provide access to contraception. In one of his most high-profile cases, he defended the religious owners of retailer Hobby Lobby who refused to fund birth control via staff health insurance. \nGun rights: He hasn't ruled directly on firearms restrictions, but is thought to be generally pro-second amendment. He once wrote in a legal opinion that a citizen's right to bear arms \"must not be infringed lightly\". \nEuthanasia: He has been vocal about assisted dying, writing a book in 2009 which opposed legalisation.
