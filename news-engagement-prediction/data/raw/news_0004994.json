While that may have been anticipated, the uncustomary and highly politicized wording in a government statement was not. It led to furious responses from some former White House officials and others.\n“Obamacare has failed the American people, with one broken promise after another,” said current Health and Human Services spokesman Matt Lloyd, as reported by CNBC . “We look forward to providing relief to those who are being harmed by the status quo and pursuing patient-centered solutions that will work for the American people,” he added.\nThat prompted, Benjamin Wakana, who held Lloyd's position until two weeks ago, to fire back. \"That statement is insane,” he told CNBC. “Considering the (Affordable Care Act) covered 20 million more people than any Republican plan.\"\nHow Trump's repeal and replace could change Texas health care \"Given the current climate we are beyond being surprised at anything,\" responded Jose Ibarra, Texas, Deputy State Director of Enroll America, noting that the uninsured rate in Texas has fallen below the 20 percent mark. \"It is undeniable that lives have been saved. The ACA is definitely not a failure.\"\nA detailed plan from the White House about how the Affordable Care Act will be replaced has not been released, which has led to uncertainty in the market. Republicans in Congress hinted at trying to “repair” the law this week.\nUsing the word repair captures what the majority of Americans want, Frank Luntz, a prominent Republican consultant told Bloomberg, the publication reported Thursday . “The public is particularly hostile about skyrocketing costs, and they demand immediate change,” he said.\nThe latest CMS report includes enrollment numbers from Jan. 15 to Jan. 31. Nationwide, about 376,260 people signed up during that time, fewer than in previous reporting periods. The Trump administration stopped outreach and advertising for Obamacare during those final days.\n\"The sabotage efforts worked,\" Charles Gaba, an independent analyst who has been tracking enrollment figures told U.S. News . \"Impossible to prove causation, of course, but Healthcare.gov enrollment had been pacing last year's very closely until final week.\"\nStill, the reality is that Obamacare would need serious fixes, even if it were to remain, said Jack Hooper, a Dallas-based startup that helps people shop for health insurance.\n\"There will be some serious hand-waving to satisfy political promises to repeal Obamacare,\" he said, but the law still deserves credit, \"for moving the needle in the national perception of access and coverage.\"", "external_links": ["https://dallasnews.imgix.net/1484679055-Health-Overhaul-Sign-ups.jpg?w=724&h=500&auto=format&q=60&fit=clip", "https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-02-01/republicans-rebrand-obamacare-strategy-from-repeal-to-repair", "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2017-02-03/as-donald-trump-takes-the-presidency-obamacare-signups-drop", "http://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/03/more-than-9-million-people-signed-up-on-federal-obamacare-exchange-by-close-of-open-enrollment-government-says.html"], "published": "2017-02-04T02:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T03:31:16.048+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
