This is ‘Moonlight,’ the Best Picture.” \nBack in 2015, Harvey mistakenly crowned the wrong Miss Universe during the live pageant. Good morning everybody! Went to sleep early last night. So... what I miss? #Oscars — Steve Harvey (@IAmSteveHarvey) February 27, 2017 Tune in to @SteveHarveyFM at 8 AM ET today for my response to last night's #Oscars . YOU KNOW I have something to say 😂 — Steve Harvey (@IAmSteveHarvey) February 27, 2017 Call me Warren Beatty. I can help you get through this! #Oscars — Steve Harvey (@IAmSteveHarvey) February 27, 2017 \nThe humor of the moment was not lost on social media. Comparisons to Harvey were made. Laughs were had. \"Nobody can f*** up an awards show again, right?\"-Steve Harvey\"Hold my beer.\" - #Oscars Staff — Josh Macuga (@JoshMacuga) February 27, 2017 Steve Harvey sitting at the crib like...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T20:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T16:03:49.926+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
