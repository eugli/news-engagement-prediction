And bitch u know I have it. LOL” \nA post shared by The Shade Room (@theshaderoom) on Feb 23, 2017 at 7:26pm PST \nOn an episode of Watch What Happens Live , Kenya admitted her chest doesn’t always look real because it’s the first place she loses and gains weight. \n“They get bigger as I'm aging. If I gain, like, two pounds, it's going to my boobs. It's crazy. I'm, like, going up in a bra size lately.” \n\nDo you believe Kenya is all natural? Sound off below. \n\nThe Real Housewives of Atlanta Season 9 airs Sundays at 8 p.m. ET on Bravo. \nCheck out more of Wetpaint ’s coverage of Real Housewives of Atlanta Season 9 below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T03:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:16:30.615+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
