There's also in-body 5-axis video stabilisation featured as well. A bit disappointing is the fact that the EOS M6 only shoots in Full HD, albeit at 60p, but it would have been nice to take 4K footage as well. Image 1 of 4 Image 3 of 4 Image 4 of 4 \nThere's Canon's Dual Pixel CMOS AF – which we've seen on Canon's EOS M5 and it has impressed us – so provided there hasn't been huge changes, it should deliver the goods. \nThere's a 3.0-inch tilt-angle touchscreen that now flips up for selfies and vlogs. For controls we have a thumb operated dial, while there's integrated Wi-Fi and NFC connectivity. \nOn top of that, a constant connection between the EOS M6 and your smartphone can be maintained via a low-energy Bluetooth connection. This not only lets you view your photographs without taking the camera from your bag, but also use your smart device to remotely trigger the shutter. An all-new viewfinder \nSold separately, Canon has also announced a new EVF-DC2 electronic viewfinder. \nCompatible with the EOS M6 and other mirrorless models, as well as some PowerShot compact cameras, the new 0.39-type EVF-DC2 features a 2.36 million dot display and a refresh rate up to 120 fps. It can't be angled like the EVF-DC1, but only weighs 29g. \nThe EOS M6 with EF-M 15-45mm f/3.5-6.3 IS STM lens will be available from April 2017, priced $899.99 £839.99 (Australian pricing still to be confirmed). \nThe EVF-DC2 will be available at the same time priced at £219.99 (US and Australian pricing still to be confirmed).
