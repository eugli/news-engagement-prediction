The highly-emotional segment featured speeches from George's Wham! bandmate Andrew Ridgeley and backing singers Helen 'Pepsi' DeMacque and Shirlie Holliman, as well as a performance from Coldplay's Chris Martin . It was especially moving for George's former partner Fadi Fawaz , who has spoken of his heartbreak after watching the show. Taking to Twitter on Thursday, the 43-year-old told followers: \"I loved the tributes at the Brits. Ex Wham touched me while the duets broke my heart.\" \nVIEW GALLERY Fadi Fawaz took to Twitter to share his thoughts on the tribute to George Michael at the Brits \nHe also said that George would have approved of Chris' performance. \"George loved Coldplay music very much. Chris was great and George was the man x.\" Chris' tribute saw him accompanied by just a pianist as he started to sing the late star's 1986 hit A Different Corner . Midway through the performance, a video recording of George singing the same track appeared on a giant screen, and the two men then sang together in harmony. At the end of the song, the star-studded audience – including Ed Sheeran , Ellie Goulding and Rita Ora – rose to their feet to give a standing ovation. \nVIEW GALLERY Andrew Ridgeley gave an emotional speech honouring the late singer \nDuring his eulogy earlier in the evening, Wham! star Andrew told the crowd George had been \"like a brother\" to him. \"On Christmas Day 2016, the greatest singer songwriter of his generation, an icon of his era, and my beloved friend George Michael was lost,\" he said. \"A supernova in a firmament of shining stars has been extinguished and it felt like the sky had fallen in.\" He added: \"He understood love, loss, happiness and grief and used it to help heal the wounds life inflicted on us… I will never forget my wonderful friend.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T13:42:16.749+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
