He said, no, you know, Dad, maybe let’s just watch TV tonight,” said Mallory. \nPosts about the joy riders on the neighborhood’s next-door community updated members on sightings and calls to police. \nThe YouTube video drew more than 60,000 views including the driver of the white SUV almost hit in the video. \n“It frightened me because my daughter was with me, and had we not come to a complete stop, they would have smashed into us, and I don’t know what would have happened,” said Kara Gunn. \nGunn hopes circulating the video will help raise awareness about the problem, and she has a message for the driver. \n“You think you’re having fun out there, and you’re maybe doing a joy ride, but there are people’s lives at stake, and those of us in this community saw how reckless you were driving, and you could kill somebody,” said Gunn. \nCBS 11 reached out to Arlington police, and they said they are checking on this and will respond Monday. \n  Gabriel Roxas facebook Follow Gabriel Roxas joined CBS 11 in December 2014.
