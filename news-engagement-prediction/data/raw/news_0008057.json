(PLEASE MAKE THIS VIRAL) Recently my close friend caught her husband cheating on her! \nIt hurts my heart to hear her husband speak about women who his own colleague her name is VANESSA who saw his wedding band and proceeded to solicit him still, or tell him she would like to be “a little more than colleague Seriously? She even a good pretender! She even call his wife to convince nothing happen. Its just a colleague not more than that! She's a liar! There's proof that they are dating and went out together and get expensive gifts for her b'day recently. \nThis women lose all my respect, and for her, I have a few choice words. They are below. Maby she just being so desperate being a single mother of one and her son stay in philippines, so she need our singapore man to support her needs.. to flirt with or pursue another woman’s husband, and especially to those who’ve acted on such flirtations in a way that would unanimously be considered cheating by said man’s wife and family. \nget it, you want a man of your own, and you crave love in your life. That’s fine. What isn’t fine, however, is that you seek this love in a man that’s already found it with someone else. If I can respect that you need love and have the right to pursue it with single men, why won’t you respect that she found what you’re after and it means the world to her and small daughter? They were happy family until u came into his life and changed him.. Advertisement \nIt’s no secret that marriage is work. This means the woman who is devoted to the man wearing the wedding band whom you’re so eagerly enticing has been working very hard on the job and your actions could result in her losing all that she’s worked to obtain. What’s that? It takes two? Of course it does; and I say shame on the men who fall into your trap too. I believe he is not the first men you seduce...A man who loves and cherishes his wife for all the right reasons should see that no good will come from engaging in an indiscretion with you. \nVanesssa you say you’re in search of “real love” and a “good man”, but what on earth makes you think that a man who would step out on his own family to play pretend with you is actually worth your time? And exactly how do you expect to sleep at night once he’s “yours”? Self love is the key that opens the door to so many wonderful things in life. Working over time to open a door that’s not for you to walk through will almost ensure that there’s no prize behind it, but rather unimaginable heartache and pain. \nYou say there’s a shortage of good men in this world. Is that so? Well, if that’s true, how is the solution to that possibly forever tainting one of the few who still remain? Seems like desperate and reckless behavior to me. VANESSA are those the kinds of values you want to build a relationship on? You shouldn’t. \nI know a lot of you tell yourselves that if he chooses to be with you then he must have made “the better choice”, but I just don’t see it that way. I see a man who chose the easy route and a woman with values as poor as his own; a man who will most likely one day leave you too. (You’re fooling yourself if you think he won’t.) That’s no man I’d want to choose; so why do you? \nOh wait, is it because you “can love him better”? Or because you “do all the things she just won’t”, right? It may be time to ask yourself if all the “things” you do that he likes so much are those becoming of a real woman or lady? \nVANESSA please dont make us look down on foreigner like you! The government are bringing too many of them to Singapore and these women are taking away our job and husbands. Those who are married would know the challenges to keep a family together, have a decent saving, educate our children and also take care of our spouses so that they will not run away with foreigners. Everytime i see a filipino I get very angry. Because there are too many of them creating a mess out of our lives. \nTo Vanessa who stole someone husband and some other guys too. please use your brain and touch your heart. Don’t take away other people’s property or belonging. He is someone husband someone father. Please go back to your rotten country dont disturb us singaporean... If you have worked with them you will know what I mean this pinoy very good in acting.she even call her scandal wife and convince her not to worry she dont have any feeling not more than a colleague. But there's proof that they been dating together and get expensive gifts from him on her b'day recently. YOU BETTER WATCH OUT VANESSA! she working in evonik Jurong island.. please becareful with her.. she is a big liar.. pinoy bitch! \nPinky A.S.S.
