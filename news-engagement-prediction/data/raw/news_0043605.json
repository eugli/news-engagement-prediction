Slot to 247Sports Links \nThe qualifications of Lonzo Ball to be an early selection in the 2017 NBA Draft stand on their own, but Lavar Ball, Lonzo's father, has entered the picture as a hype man for his son in recent weeks, daring to suggest that Lonzo will be a better NBA player than Steph Curry. Lavar cleared up any uncertainty about how seriously he meant that comment on Saturday night during an interview that took place during UCLA's 102-70 win over Southern California. \n\"Let me tell you this right now. I have the utmost confidence in what my boy’s doing. I’m gonna tell you right now, he’s better than Steph Curry to me. Put Steph Curry on UCLA’s team right now, and put my boy on Golden State and watch what happens. \nI'll double down on it again. Steph's gonna have problems trying to guard my boy ... I think all three of my boys will be in the [NBA] All-Star Game one day.\" \nOdds are, none of Lavar's three sons will be two-time NBA MVPs. Only 13 players in the history of the league have been named league MVP more than once. His chances of having sired a Hall-of-Famer are better than most dads, but still not great. And if you put a two-time NBA MVP on UCLA and an 18-year-old on Golden State, the Bruins would get a lot better and the Warriors would get ... slightly less incredible. Icy helmet designs for each NFL team Start SlideShow \nAnd hey, I get it. Lavar Ball's job is not to be a dispassionate evaluator of his sons' NBA prospects. His job is to be the best father to his sons that he can. Perhaps he believes part of that equation is pumping up his children in the media. Although it's worth wondering whether taking shots at Steph Curry months before the NBA Draft is more likely to help or hurt Lonzo's stock.
