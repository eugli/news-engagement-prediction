Monday 6 February 2017 05.07 GMT Last modified on Monday 6 February 2017 05.19 GMT \nI n January, the organisers of Laneway festival announced they would be setting up a dedicated hotline at each of their venues to help female punters combat abuse and sexual harassment at their festival. It was inspired by a 2016 initiative launched by the Melbourne band Camp Cope, which called on the music community to band together against what seems to be a worrying increase in reported instances of physical assault at rock shows. \nFor women who love live music, this seemed like a lifetime in the making. Unwanted advances and sexual harassment and assault have been synonymous with dark, sweaty gigs for so long they almost blurred the lines of acceptability until enough people decided to speak out against them. I have been lucky enough to work with many exceptional women across the music industry, many of whom are my friends. Not one of them can recall a long stretch of time when they weren’t harassed, either verbally or physically, at a live gig. I'm a trans artist – why am I expected to be an activist and educator too? | Ivan Coyote Read more \nOn Sunday, I had the unfortunate displeasure of experiencing what that sort of behaviour looks like firsthand: a young guy in a pack of three decided to speak inappropriately to a friend of mine, before brazenly groping her in broad daylight. When I decided to intervene, the only thing stopping me from getting dragged into a physical altercation with his two male friends was the fact that they’d have to hit a girl to get through to me. After threatening me a number of times and using the glorious epithet “white knight fag”, they eventually stood down and left. \nGang of Youths were playing on stage while this was happening – a band whose frontman, Dave Leaupepe, has the kind of hulking upper body that could rip a man limb from limb if necessary. As I sat at the bar after the incident, for a moment I almost wished my body was built like his – and it upset me that being a regular guy had actually made me the weakest person in a scenario where I should have been the strongest. \nWere I the size of a man like Leaupepe, the situation probably would have ended quickly with a sincere apology, instead of ending as it did: with the threat of physical violence and the perpetrators escaping without facing any consequences. This is the double bind of trying to diffuse an uncomfortable public situation, where it is unlikely you’ll be able to make your point unless you can successfully intimidate the other party. \nBut then I realised there was another solution. It was all of the people around us. If they didn’t see what had happened, they definitely got wind of it afterwards – but at no point did anyone try and intervene. This is unconscionable to me. \nLaneway in particular has always been a festival that has made a point of supporting women, both on and off stage. Their lineups are renowned for inclusivity and part of the reason the hotline was launched was because Camp Cope were on this year’s bill. However, it’s clear the hotline only exists in the absence of a united community response to this sort of behaviour. Jet bring rock back to the electronic age: 'People are always going to want to go and see a band' Read more \nOur perpetrator likely went on to harass innumerable other women that day, his relative anonymity ensured by the cover of thousands of other punters. It would only have taken a few other people around us deciding that this was unacceptable to completely alter the outcome, call the offender out, alert security and ideally have them removed from the premises. That’s not a failure of the festival; it’s our failure as the extended music-loving community to actually act when we see something is wrong. \nFor Australian music fans, it is in our nature to support one another. Our festival climate supports crowdsurfers, human towers, stage invaders and ridiculous guys who shimmy up gigantic tent pylons. In fact, individual success is almost always related to the mass. \nIt’s high time we applied that to sexual harassment and assault, too. It’s not up to the bands and the festivals to do the heavy lifting any more. It’s on us.
