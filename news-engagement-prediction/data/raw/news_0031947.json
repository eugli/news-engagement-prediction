Ancient banyans with thick aerial roots propping them up stand on sentinel duty as women in bright saris with equally bright baskets propped on their heads snake down the narrow mountain roads, pausing only to give us quick directions. \n\nInside Nellikad Estate , our destination that morning, Tej Thammaiah , a third-generation planter, sits at a long dining table for eight, with his family. Breakfast is in progress. \n\n\n\nKodava-style akki rotis, made from dough that uses both cooked rice and rice flour in the mix, plumped up like self-respecting northern phulkas, are being used to scoop up pandhi curry, the traditional pork preparation from the region. \n\nThere’s a fragrant orange cake that Shuchi, Tej’s wife, has baked, flavoured with rind from the fruit that grows so plentifully in this sprawling 150 acre estate. To wash all this down is coffee — made in two ways. \n\nFor the Thammaiah grandmother, touching 90, traditional Kodava coffee is being stirred. It is diluted, boiled with spices and sweetened with jaggery. This is the brew the community in this part of Karnataka has always had as their beverage of choice, ever since the British introduced coffee plantations here. \n\nAlso Read: Coffee Break: Get closer to caffeine in a remote plantation in Sakleshpur \n\nFor the rest of the family, there’s another way of making and drinking coffee that is been adopted more recently. Tej is doing the honours that morning — with an AeroPress. \n\nHe carefully measures out 10 grams of the coarsely ground Clouds in My Coffee, a bestselling gourmet blend by The Flying Squirrel , an artisanal coffee brand that he co-owns. \n\nHe puts this in the AeroPress and pushes hot water through it. Voila, in less than a minute, we have a cup full of clean flavours — with just a whiff of the monsoon mustiness this particular blend promises. \n\nThe difference between the way in which the Thammaiah matriarch drinks her coffee and the rest of the family now does summarise the phenomenal change in India’s coffee culture over the last few years. \n\n\n\nFrom believing that sipping from glistening steel tumblers was the only “proper” way to drink filter coffee — steaming hot, mostly milky, sweet and often chicory-adulterated — to driving down for “cool” cappuccinos and lattes at chains like Barista, Cafe Coffee Day and lately Starbucks, Indian consumers have been steadily changing their patterns of drinking the world’s favourite beverage. \n\nFor the last two years or so, we are in the midst of the third wave of drinking coffee. Gourmet beans are becoming hip lifestyle choices. The AeroPress,pour-overs and even cold“nitro” brews are no longer alien terms. “Artisanal”, “singleestate”, “bean to cup” are badges of sophistication to flaunt in a world where instant is instantly dismissed. \n\nIn the midst of all this, the younger metropolitan coffee drinker is also perhaps discovering what it means to taste — whether the roast is fresh, dark or light, the nose imbued with vanilla or spice, the blend more arabica than robusta or balanced — and indeed whether s/he likes it at all, which is really what any discovery of food and drink should be about. \n\nThe Third Wave \nLeading the third wave of artisanal coffee — freshly roasted, blended by amateur or sometimes professional “cuppers” (coffee tasters) to highlight various intrinsic flavours in the beans, and mostly retailed online — are brands like Thammaiah’s The Flying Squirrel, which came up in Bengaluru in 2013. \n\nAlmost at the same time, in Delhi, Blue Tokai , which sources its beans from several estates in the country but does not own any of these, also started marketing its coffee and changing the perception of young drinkers. \n\n\n\nSince then there has been a spurt in artisanal Indian coffee labels that promise a world-class experience in your cup because it is a mistake to see all Indian coffee as necessarily indifferent or inferior to, say, what the African nations or the South Americans produce. \n\nToday, there are a handful of artisanal coffee brands in the country, including The Flying Squirrel, Indian Bean, Blue Tokai, Halli Berri, Third Wave Roasters, Estate Craft, Riverine and Bynemara. \n\nMost of these source their beans from estates in Kodagu, Chikmagalur and Wayanad, traditional coffee growing areas in the Western Ghats. However, only about half of these companies have their own estates and can be called bean-to-cup operators — where the growers themselves are also the retailers. \n\nThe Flying Squirrel is the biggest in terms of volume (even though this is small-batch coffee) and in its reach (online retail, B2B reach and now a cafe directed at end consumers). \n\nWhen we drive down to the Nellikad Estate, from where almost all the beans for the blends the company makes come, it is harvest season. Delicate white coffee flowers are in bloom; a rare sight because they last for just about three days in the season. \n\nThe ground is strewn with dark brown berries left to sun dry; and there is a lab with almost constant activity — testing, tasting and R&D. “The reputation that Indian coffee has — of being sub-standard or inferior to that produced in Africa or South America — is ill deserved. In fact, some of the best Arabica grows here and it is used in some top-quality blends in countries like Italy and Germany. \n\n\n\nThis image is because of lack of marketing,” says former ad man Ashish D’Abreo, founder-partner, The Flying Squirrel. D’Abreo, who ran an agency in Bengaluru, has just quit that to devote his attention to the coffee business, which began as a passion project with his college mate Tej. \n\nIndia is the sixth largest coffee producer but exports 70 per cent of its beans. Most of the coffee in the domestic market — estimated at `36.6 billion in 2015, according to a Euromonitor 2016 report, “Coffee in India” — is obviously instant and bulk. \n\nHowever, the small artisanal business seems to be catching on. While consolidated figures are not available for the fledgling business, individual players offer a sense of the potential. \n\nThe Flying Squirrel says it doubled its sales last year, selling 6 tonnes of coffee to customers in 32 cities in 2016, up from 3.5 tonnes in 2015. From being primarily online retail-led or supplying to select cafes in the metros, the artisanal players are now upping the ante. \n\nBoth Blue Tokai — which received a seed investment from Snow Leopard — and The Flying Squirrel have now opened their own cafes because it is important to educate the customers and allow them to taste and compare the coffees. “ Consumers ’ tastes have evolved. \n\nEarlier, people were happy with something hot, frothy and bittersweet. Now most can discern the difference in taste among various coffee chains. There are also many customers who further appreciate the finer points of high-quality coffee,” says Rhea Sanghi, who works with Blue Tokai. The company plans to open more cafes in Delhi and Mumbai. \n\nIn Bengaluru’s Koramangala, The Flying Squirrel cafe is a cheerful space, where you can peck at deliberately non-coffee offerings such as beer-battered prawns, zucchini cakes and pulled pork (with pandhi curry spices) and millets lasagne. \n\nHowever, the attention remains focused on the in-house micro-roastery. “We do all our roasting here and since all the coffee that we send out is freshly roasted, the roastery is always in use. \n\nThis is a good way to engage the customers and educate them,” says D’Abreo. For the record, you should keep a freshly roasted coffee for maximum 25-30 days. In the general market, sometimes, commercial blends as old as six months sell. \n\n\nWake Up and Smell the Coffee \nFreshness is a requisite but what makes a coffee gourmet or at least good? At least, part of the answer must be terroir. The world of coffee has surprising parallels with the world of wine. \n\nIf one of the most frequently heard discussions around wine is whether a superior wine is made in the vineyards or in the cellar, this is how we must now also discuss coffee. \n\nThe role of the cellar master can hardly be overemphasised when you talk about a quality champagne, for instance, which is also a blend. Whether to emphasise strength or delicacy? How to bring out the best notes of freshness or complexity? How to balance the acidity, tannins, sweetness? How much to age to give wine its body and emphasise structure? All these are decisions the cellar master takes based on his palate and understanding. \n\nThis is similar to the role of a cupper who will roast the beans and blend them to produce different flavours. Should your final blend come from 100 per cent arabica (and which strains should it be) or should there be structure imposed by the robust robusta, and in what proportion? \n\nHow should the beans be processed — in the traditional sun drying method, or the “wet” method (in which all the pulp is removed before drying the beans), or newer experiments by which some of the pulp is left behind? How much should the beans be roasted? All these are decisions the taster-roaster takes that impact the taste of what’s in your cup. \n\n\n\n\nHowever, you cannot produce good wine from bad grapes. Nor can you produce quality coffee from bad beans — which is why the idea of “single estate” coffee being inherently quality coffee is flawed. \n\nThe tag “single estate” may mean nothing more than a snobbish statement if the beans are not grown and processed correctly. In fact, for some estates, it may be better to balance their production by blending them with beans from elsewhere. \n\nTerroir in the world of wine means everything from the slope of the land to the sunshine, water and air of a place that affects the grapes. The French popularised the term and marketed it but it really is an important factor in wine-making as also in any agribusiness. \n\nIn the coffee estate, as we see some bushes sheltered by trees; others, hardier, exposed to more sunlight; and patches interspersed with vanilla, pepper plants and even oranges and gooseberries, we begin to understand the dynamics a little better. One day, a whiff of any or some of these may find its way into our cup back home in a dusty, choking city.
