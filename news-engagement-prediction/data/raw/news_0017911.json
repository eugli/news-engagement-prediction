Broadnax, in case you're looking for the latest example of why so many folks don't trust their local government, consider this: \nJody Jones' direction of Dallas Animal Services in 2016 was, at best, mediocre. In some cases, it was worse than lousy. Now taxpayers learn that her bosses -- Assistant City Manager Joey Zapata and Code Compliance Director Kris Sweckard -- gave Jones an overwhelmingly positive evaluation in December and a 3 percent merit raise . \nCity Manager Broadnax, we realize you were busy running Tacoma, Wash., in 2016. So let us share what Jones -- who now makes more than $124,000 a year despite no longer even managing the shelter -- was doing here in Dallas. \nWhen Antoinette Brown was mauled to death by dogs May 2, Jones' response about the South Dallas death was heartless and wrongheaded . \"I hate to say it, but people die in traffic fatalities every day,\" Jones said. \"I wish we could be everywhere to everyone, but that just isn't reality.\" \nFacing growing concerns about the loose-dog problem in southern Dallas, she first stonewalled against roundups. When finally forced to increase dog-catching, her effort was woefully inadequate. Former Dallas Animal Services leader under criminal investigation \nIn August, the Boston Consulting Group presented a damning assessment of Dallas Animal Services' massive shortcomings -- from management of the shelter to the lack of any strategy that would even dent the problem of 8,700 loose dogs roaming the southern half of the city. \nSoon after, Jones was demoted; Dallas Police Maj. Barbara Hobbs is now running things. And, surprise, Dallas Animal Services is doing exactly what Jones claimed it couldn't : Picking up more dogs while actually increasing the number that make it out of the shelter alive. \nAnother lowlight from Jones' 2016: A city audit of Dallas Animal Services, which began even before the BCG report, revealed compliance problems that included lax record-keeping on drugs, security lapses and lack of veterinary inspections. \nAnd just Friday, as documented by Dallas Morning News City Hall reporter Tristan Hallman, we learned Jones is the subject of a criminal investigation . It seems that soon after the police team took over in September, it sent concerns to City Hall about the shelter's financial dealings with the Dallas Companion Animal Project, a\"friends of the shelter\" nonprofit. Fingers crossed that new Dallas city manager is a fast learner \nJones, who said the city won't allow her to comment on the investigation, hasn't officially been charged with any wrongdoing. For now, she is out of the shelter and working on a Code Compliance project -- and drawing that nice salary. \nHow could any competent supervisor defend an evaluation rating of \"fully satisfactory\" and a raise of any amount after a year like Jones had in 2016? Zapata's best answer is that she met her narrowly defined goals. \nWe certainly hope Zapata's own boss, Broadnax, can put a stop to the kind of nonsense that results in raises for inglorious performance. Whether favoritism, disregard for the facts, or fear of a tough conversation is at the heart of this lack of accountability, no wonder Dallas Animal Services -- and who knows how many other city operations -- are badly broken. Evaluation excerpts \nDallas Animal Services manager Jody Jones received a rating of \"fully satisfactory\" on an evaluation signed Dec. 9, 2016. Her grades in almost every category were at the top of the scale. Examples from the written narrative by her bosses: \nKey objectives: \"1) hiring to fill ongoing key vacant positions, 2) developing strategies/approaches for improving the loose dog issue in the city and 3) continuing to improve the live release rate and shelter operations.\" \n\"Due to a tragic incident [the Antoinette Brown mauling] the focus intensified on the loose dog issue even more. Jody took a lot of blame for the incident from the media and others.\" \n\"It was a difficult year for Jody, but considering the objectives set for her, the results over the entire year and in all areas, and the resources given, \"I feel that Jody met the standards of a 'Fully Successful' rating.\" View Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T03:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:18:31.691+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
