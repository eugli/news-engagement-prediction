Before the upcoming 89th annual Academy Awards this Sunday, February 26, Us Weekly has rounded up everything you need to know about the sexual harassment allegations plaguing the Oscar nominee. \nAffleck, 41, has won more than a dozen awards for his performance in 2016’s Manchester by the Sea (including the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Drama Motion Picture) and is pegged as the favorite to win best actor at the Oscars. However, his success has raised eyebrows in Hollywood. Both actors and activists have protested his accolades, slamming the Academy for disregarding the claims made against Affleck — Ben Affleck ’s younger brother — in two now-settled lawsuits. Best Oscar Dresses of All Time \nThe allegations date back to 2008 and 2009, when the Boston native was shooting his indie film I’m Still Here . According to Time , two women working on the project claimed that the Assassination of Jesse James star had behaved inappropriately with them. One of the women alleged that Affleck crawled into bed with her, without permission, while she was asleep. And the other woman claimed that the actor pressured her to stay in the hotel room and “violently grabbed [her] arm in an effort to intimidate her into staying” when she refused, the complaint states.

Affleck responded to the allegations in a 2016 email to The New York Times . \"It was settled to the satisfaction of all. I was hurt and upset — I am sure all were — but I am over it,” he wrote. “It was an unfortunate situation, mostly for the innocent bystanders of the families of those involved.” \nThough the cases have been settled, several celebrities — namely, Fresh Off the Boat star Constance Wu — are having difficulty reconciling the former claims against Affleck with his present triumph during the awards circuit.

BUY ur way out of trouble by settling out of court!” Wu, 34, sarcastically tweeted in January. “Just do a good acting job, thats all that matters! bc Art isn’t about humanity, right?” \nThe outspoken actress added in a subsequent post: \"I've been counseled not to talk about this for career's sake. F my career then, I'm a woman & human first. That's what my craft is built on.\" You May Also Like", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:55:52.348+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
