Her mum has suffered from mental health problems after her dad died in 2011. \n\"As a 13-year-old she had to look after her mum and all of the legal issues as Roshani can't speak English. \n\"She's on track to get a First despite all of the pressures she's had to deal with but now she can't finish her degree and it's just hearbreaking. All of her hard work is going to be for nothing.\" Devastated Satkunarajah was arrested last Tuesday with mum Roshani (Photo: Facebook) \nEarlier Shiromini told the Daily Post : “I didn’t expect them to not send the decision to my home. \n“To get the decision after being arrested was a shock. \n“I have no family in Sri Lanka. My mother has two siblings in Canada and one in Germany. \n“For me, the UK is where I spent my life since I was 12, and I have an emotional attachment to this country. \n“For them to say they are putting me in cells is very sad.” A family member said the 20-year-old is 'very emotional' but 'staying strong' (Photo: Facebook) \nIestyn Pierce, Bangor’s head of electrical engineering, described Shiromini as “exceptionally able and diligent”. \n“I have no doubt that Shiromini would achieve first-class honours,” he said. \nAfter a series of appeals, her application for leave to finish her education has now been denied. \nMP Hywel Williams criticised the “unduly severe“ decision. \nHe said: “Her imminent deportation is not only unjust and unfair but will deprive Wales and indeed the UK economy of the contribution she will make. \n“Sri Lanka is still a very dangerous place and Shiromini has had no real ties with the country since she was a child.
