John Wilkes Booth: Actor or Activist? \nMarch at Village Magazine. \n— Mickey White (@BiasedGirl) February 3, 2017 \nDonald Trump is changing the game. For the media, that is. And not just the American media. \nHere’s the cover art for the most recent issue of Germany’s Der Spiegel: German magazine Der Spiegel depicts Trump cutting off the Statue of Liberty's head https://t.co/LxGLXfu8SR pic.twitter.com/ztG738uUPJ \n— Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) February 3, 2017 \nThink that’s messed up? Check out this cover from Irish politics and culture magazine Village: Village February out today, Friday. Cover and editorial: why taking #Trump out would be unethical pic.twitter.com/Wr2lmgTtvx \n— Village Magazine (@VillageMagIRE) February 3, 2017 \nWay to keep things classy, Village. 1. That cover is deplorable.2. That you have to explain assassinating a president is \"unethical\" is telling. \n— Ric White (@ScoobyCheese) February 3, 2017 @VillageMagIRE Oh you're arguing it would NOT be ethical to take him out? Tell that to your cover designer lol. \n— O Yassoon (@desmundio) February 3, 2017 I can't imagine thinking so little of my audience that I had to write a feature on why murder is bad, even if it's someone you don't like. https://t.co/TBPL9DDIzQ \n— Noah Rothman (@NoahCRothman)  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T03:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T23:23:26.211+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
