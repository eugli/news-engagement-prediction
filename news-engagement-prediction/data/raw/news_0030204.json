As they got out of the car they surrounded them and frog-marched them inside the house‚” he said. \nDeavin said the gang was well organised and operated like a professional outfit. “They were all wearing balaclavas and gloves and two of the men had been armed with Glocks. They were calm in how they instructed the couple to hand over money‚ guns and valuables‚” he said. \n“They were smart‚ they stayed at the house for nearly three hours‚ getting the couple to unlock their phones and computers so that they could disable any form of tracking apps. They also managed to disable the vehicle tracker in the couple’s car‚” he added. \nThe men are also understood to have made off with expensive photography equipment. \n“The couple were bound and then locked in a walk-in safe. They spent the whole night in there before they managed to free themselves and remove a panel from the door and get out. It was quite an ordeal.” \nTrevor Rees was attacked by a gang of men on his farm Pudsey last week and died after several days in the Edendale hospital. He was shot and tortured by his attackers. A week prior‚ Gavin Carter was shot and killed on the farm West Ilsley. \nThree men have been arrested in connection with the murders and are expected to appear in the Himeville Magistrate’s court on Monday.
