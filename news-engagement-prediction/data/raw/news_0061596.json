The duo allegedly hounded Gus through the paddock and left beer bottles strewn in the grass. \nClaudia Anstice, who owned the other two horses, said Gus had been \"harassed so much that he was in a blind panic and ran straight into a gate at full force\". SUPPLIED \nPolice were forced to euthanise Karina Romeyn's horse, Gus, after he was allegedly terrorised by two drunk men early on Saturday morning. \n\"There was no sign in the dirt of him slowing down, and even when he hit the gate he seemed to keep going, he must of been terrified,\" she said. Track marks indicated he had looped around and charged back into a fence before collapsing near the road. \nREAD MORE: \nThe 7-year-old horse sustained critical injuries, including broken ribs, a punctured lung and internal bleeding. Police were forced to euthanise him by gunshot soon after. SUPPLIED \nPolice were forced to euthanise Karina Romeyn's horse, Gus, left, after he was allegedly terrorised by two drunk men early on Saturday morning. \nAnstice said she had no idea how long Gus was left lying in the paddock before the family were alerted by a member of the public. They were trying to piece together his final moments by following the trail of blood spread across the three paddocks on Lake Terrace Rd. \nCharlie and Steve suffered cuts and knocks to their bodies and were traumatised from the incident, she said. \nThe now timid pair had been moved to another paddock and \"won't leave each other's side\". GEORGE HEARD/FAIRFAX NZ \nMonet Romeyn and Claudia Anstice's horses were abused on Saturday morning, resulting in one of the horses being put down. \n\"We're so shocked, angry and sad, it's just hard being here,\" Anstice said. Ad Feedback \n\"It's like a murder scene.\" \nMonet Romeyn said her mother had owned Gus for about a year, and he had been the perfect animal to help her regain confidence after a riding accident. \n\"He was lazy and quiet, and always after food\", she said. \n\"He used to stand all day at the fence and parents would bring their kids down and feed him apples – he liked that.\" \nA police spokesperson said officers were \"following up lines of inquiries\", but no arrests had been made. \nAnyone with information about the incident or who was in the area of Lake Terrace Rd about 4.45am on Saturday was asked to call Christchurch police on 03 363 7400.
