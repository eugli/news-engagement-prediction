My name is Olivia, and I am creating this in hopes to help out my best friend Jess.Since she was young, she has battled with an eating disorder. She has been diagnosed with Anorexia. She's been in and out of treatment, and is facing going back again. She wants to finally beat this nasty disorder once and for all. She's so motivated and says she will not let herself fail. The only problem is, she has to has $3000 up front for a deductible so she can be admitted. She is going to be going to a treatment center called Castlewood in St. Louis. It's an amazing place, and I know she will be able to get the help she needs.She will have to stay for awhile, but her insurance won't cover as long as she needs, so the amount will add up quickly. She already has medical bills to pay, from previous hospital stays and treatment, so going to treatment now is near impossible unless she comes up with the funds.If she does not go to treatment, things don't look good. She has tried to take care of it, so she can get better, but unfortunately, it cannot be done this time without extensive help.She will have to take take unpaid medical leave from her job, and miss graduation from college, but she needs to go to be able to get better. She simply cannot go though, if she doesn't have the funds. That's why I'm making this page.If you cannot donate, please share! And please pray for her strength and courage. Please pray that she can fight this once and for all. Pray for her family and friends as it is hard on them. Pray she makes it through and beats this!She plans to keep everyone updated, and try to write letters to those who donate.
