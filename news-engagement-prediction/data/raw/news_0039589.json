(Photo: Lim Yun Suk) A \nKUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia has detained a second woman in connection with the murder of Kim Jong Nam, the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, state news agency Bernama reported on Thursday, citing the inspector general of police. \nAn official statement on the arrest would be issued later in the day, IGP Khalid Abu Bakar told Bernama. \nMalaysian police on Wednesday detained a woman holding Vietnam travel papers and said they were looking for a \"few\" other foreign suspects in connection with the apparent assassination. \nCOURT APPEARANCE \nThe 28-year-old suspect who was carrying a Vietnamese passport was due to appear in court on Thursday. \nPolice said she was held overnight following her arrest, after reports. \n\"We are looking for more suspects,\" Selangor state police chief Abdul Samah Mat told AFP, but declined to say how many were being sought, or their nationalities. \nThe two women struck on Monday as Kim Jong-Nam was readying to board a flight to Macau where he has spent many years in exile, South Korea's spy chief Lee Byung-Ho has said, pointing the finger of blame at the North. \nMalaysian police said Kim, a portly 45-year-old with a playboy reputation, was walking through the departure hall when he was attacked. \nCCTV images that emerged in Malaysian media, purportedly of one of the suspects, showed an Asian woman wearing a white top with the letters \"LOL\" emblazoned on the front. \nKimâ€™s body was being held at Kuala Lumpur Hospital following an autopsy, the results of which have not yet been released. \nMalaysian media cited unnamed official sources as saying North Korea had requested the body, but Abdul Samah said Wednesday that nobody had come forward and that it would remain in the morgue until it was claimed. \nHowever North Korean embassy officials were seen visiting the hospital's forensics department in a diplomatic vehicle on Wednesday afternoon and again overnight. - Agencies/mn", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T09:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T04:55:10.609+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
