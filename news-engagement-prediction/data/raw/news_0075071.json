Workouts won’t start until Friday, which is when the top prospects will run the always-intriguing 40-yard dash. \nChris Johnson’s record time of 4.24 seconds from 2008 still stands, but Adidas is trying to give the 300-plus players running the 40 added motivation to beat it. How? By giving anyone who breaks the record their own island. There’s just one caveat: It has to be done in the 2017 adizero 5-star 40 cleats. Paradise awaits. \n— adidas Football US (@adidasFballUS) February 27, 2017 \nThis isn’t the first time Adidas has offered up a huge prize for any prospect who can break Johnson’s record. Last year, $1 million was on the line for a record-breaking run, while in 2015, $100,000 was awarded to the top three times in the 40. \nAn island is nice, but $1 million is probably more valuable – especially for a speedy player who may not find himself drafted in the first round.
