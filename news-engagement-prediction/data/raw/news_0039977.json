Credit: Entertainment Weekly on Instagram \nOf course, the sneak peek video is all about Elena. \nIn the clip, we see the former cheerleader staring at a trophy case in what definitely looks like Mystic Falls High. \n“What happened?” she asks in voiceover. “Why am I here right now?” \nReports from the TVD finale set gives us a few hints about what the answer to that question will be. A post shared by Samantha Highfill (@samhighfill) on Feb 16, 2017 at 10:02am PST \n“It was a very emotional few days on set,” Entertainment Weekly ’s Samantha Highfill says after visiting the finale set. “The first day I was there was a funeral.” \nConsidering how Elena’s magically-induced slumber works — she sleeps until BFF Bonnie Bennett 's life ends — does that mean Kat Graham ’s alter ego needs to watch her back? \nIt’s certainly possible Bonnie’s life is at stake. “It’s a big death … Fans are really going to be impacted,” EW reports. \nHowever, one photo proves Elena’s pal may be safe until the very last TVD episode, “I Was Feeling Epic.” \nBonnie and Caroline Forbes both appear in another released photo of the Vampire Diaries finale, which you can see here . \nThe pair’s off-the-charts level of surprise hints they’re reacting to Elena's return. \nWhat do you think brings Elena back from the other side? Drop your theories in the comments section now! \nThe Vampire Diaries airs Fridays at 8 p.m. ET on the CW. \nCheck out more of Wetpaint’s coverage of The Vampire Diaries below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T01:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T21:23:38.778+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
