It's not necessarily the championship that attracts me the most, but it could permit me to take the next step.\" Two clubs interested \nNot exactly the most ringing endorsement of English football you've ever heard. However, the 27-year-old is indeed being targeted by Premier League clubs, at least according to The Sun. \nThe newspaper have it that Liverpool are set to enter the race for his signature and are prepared to go toe-to-toe with Manchester City. \nIf that's the case, it'll be another interesting battle between two former Bundesliga managers in Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola. \nOf course, Klopp was the man who brought the forward to Dortmund, so that could give him an advantage. Problems up front \nLiverpool's lack of a world-class striker has been key to their problems since the turn of the year, and the Reds could, therefore, sell the flailing Daniel Sturridge to West Ham to finance an audacious £40million bid for Aubameyang. \nAs for City, they hope they can tempt the highly-rated striker to the Etihad if Sergio Aguero cuts his losses at the end of the season. \nThe Argentine was dropped to the bench against Swansea as Gabriel Jesus once again stole the limelight, so it remains to be seen how Guardiola will balance the Brazilian wonderkid with Aubameyang if he does arrive. \nIn recent history, Dortmund have struggled to hold onto their best players, losing the likes of Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Mats Hummels, and Robert Lewandowski, so this could be another huge blow.
