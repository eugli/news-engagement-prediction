That’s completely unfair and outrageous. \n“Overall I don’t regret anything we [Ukip] did. You could argue Ukip has been the most successful political party in history. \n“It had to be done. Ultimately, it was worth it, but it has come at a price, of course it has. I accept much of the price but I don’t accept the unfairness of some of it.” PA Mr Farage tells of the family struggles through Brexit and strained relations with his children \nMr Farage has received death threats and even one suspected attempt on his life when the wheel nuts on his car were loosened causing it to crash on a motorway. \nOn one occasion he and his family were chased out of a pub while they were having Sunday lunch and their vehicle was attacked by masked protesters. \nHe describes the verbal and physical attacks \"gross and unfair” saying he lives \"frankly being frightened of walking out into to the street”. \nYet he remains unrepentant about Ukip and what it stands for, adding: “I do not change the message, change what I say, change how I dress, I don’t try and pander to audiences like all our cosmetic politicians. \n\"I say it as I see it, I behave as I do and if people like it that’s terrific and if they don’t...they can take a running jump.” GETTY After winning the referendum, Mr Farage says he has been threatened and abused in the street \nMr Farage said he would see out his time in the European Parliament until 2019 before considering his next move. \nHe has been linked with a high-profile job in the US given his close links to Donald Trump - he was the first British politician to meet the President after his stunning victory last November - while others suggest he could one day become Prime Minister. \nHe said: “I have got to see the Brexit process through, we have won the war but we must win the peace. \n“If a country with raised expectations about what is going to happen actually gets let down then maybe the next phase of the British political revolution could be even bigger than the one you have just seen. If this falls to bits anything could happen.” \nPiers Morgan’s Life Stories is on tonight 9pm ITV Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:23:29.892+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
