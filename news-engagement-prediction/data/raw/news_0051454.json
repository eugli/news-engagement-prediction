Daymut \nThe new construction proposed by Pulte Homes near Fieldstone Preserve, The Woods and The Waterford Crossing affects the residents in all three communities. There are several concerns raised by the residents, some of which are outlined below. We are demanding that the City reconsider their position on this, and address all of the current residents; concerns before approving this new construction.Concerns:1) Safety Concernsa) The current flooding mitigation systems are not designed to handle the new volume of drainage. While alternative plans have been proposed, the residents who have been through several of floods previously have serious concerns. We feel that the build plan has not given enough consideration for the flooding concerns and redesign.b) Opening up Ledgestone/Ellsworth and other streets causes severe through-traffic across these communities and is a severe safety concernc) The proposed build site is approximately 11 acres. The addition of 24 homes exceeds 2 homes per acre. Using the existing Fieldstone Development to meet the requirement seems to violate the spirit of the rule2) Property Values a) The cluster homes are too close to existing properties, are of lesser value reducing the value of our propertiesb) There is not an earth mound or trees planned as buffer between these homes and the existing ones, and this WILL reduce the privacy (the primary reason many of us bough these lots), and will reduce the proprty value.3) Environmentala) Destruction of the wetland & trees will harm the Indiana Brown Bat (endangered species)b) The construction and deforestation will kill the roots of the treees and grass on our properties as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:09:00.384+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
