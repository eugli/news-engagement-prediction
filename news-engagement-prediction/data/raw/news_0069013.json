PUBLISHED: 10:55, Thu, Feb 23, 2017 | UPDATED: 13:23, Thu, Feb 23, 2017 \nThe Front National French Presidential candidate Marine Le Pen praised Mrs May for running the country with policies she would also choose. \nAppearing on French station TF1, she said: “She’s running the UK using policies that I want to run.” \nAppearing to support the Prime Minister's plan that Brexit means Brexit, she said: \"All the lights are green in the UK and all those who predicted apocalypse got it wrong.” Related articles Trade boost for Brexit negotiators as WTO CUTS global tariffs GETTY Mrs Le Pen says unelected Theresa May is doing the job she wants to be elected to do She’s running the UK using policies that I want to run Marine Le Pen \nBut she questioned Mrs May's decision not to meet Donald Trump before the US election. \nShe said: “May already made a mistake because she didn’t want to meet (with Trump). \n“Maybe she doesn’t have the flair to grasp what’s happening in the countries facing elections.” \nMrs Le Pen’s comments come as she surges ahead in the polls as her main rival socialist Emmanuel Macron fails to recover from his colonisation gaffe. GETTY Mrs Le Pen's support is growing as she continues to battle to be the first female French president \nMrs Le Pen is forecast to win the first round of the French presidential race after the favourite Francois Fillion was damaged over a scandal involving his employment of Welsh wife Penelope. \nLast week Le Pen, whose campaign slogan is \"In the name of the people\" received a further boost after the French public erupted in fury after socialist hopeful and En Marche! candidate Mr Macron, 39, apologised for French colonisation. \nAccording to the new BVA-Salesforce poll Mrs Le Pen would win 27.5 percent of the vote in the April 23 first round, up 2.5 percentage points from the last time the poll was conducted on Feb 4. GETTY Emmanuel Macron sparked fury after apologising for colonialism \nIndependent centrist Emmanuel Macron was seen coming in second in the first round with 21 percent of the vote, down one percentage point, followed by conservative Francois Fillon at 19 percent, also down one percentage point. \nCritics last week slammed Mr Macron for his decision to apologise during a trip to Algeria citing the slave trade of 1million to 1.25 million white Christian Europeans who were enslaved in North Africa for almost 300 years. \nEuropean slaves were acquired by Barbary pirates from countries including Algeria in slave raids in Italy, Spain, Portugal, France , England, the Netherlands, Ireland and Iceland, experts say. \nHowever critics seized upon Mr Macron who flew to Algeria to apologise for the French occupation which ran for 132 years until it won a bloody war of independence in 1962. \nThe war started after dissatisfaction emerged in the majority Muslim population who wanted political and economic autonomy from France. \nHe said: \"It is a crime, a crime against humanity, it is a real barbarism. \n\"And it's part of the past and now we have to look forward and present our apologies regarding those to whom we have committed these acts.\" \nBut that prompted Mrs Le Pen to slam him insisting on Facebook: \"Is there anything more serious when you want to be President of the Republic than to go abroad to accuse the country you want to lead a crime against humanity? \n\"By using this argument probably for basely electoral reasons, the crime was committed by Mr Macron\". \nMrs Le Pen's strategy on Europe could be working on the electorate in a society more and more concerned about the EU. \nAlmost 12 years ago 10 countries in the European Union decided they would allow the public to go to the ballot box to decide whether they would support the EU constitution. GETTY Le Pen says she admires Theresa May for her work on Brexit \nBut after France and the Netherlands voted overwhelmingly to remove themselves from the bloc's constitution, six other countries cancelled their referendums. \nAnd France and the Netherlands simply ignored the will of their people after they overwhelmingly rejected Brussels. \nThe crunch vote on the EU in both countries sent shockwaves through the establishment – prompting the UK, Portugal, Poland, Denmark, Ireland and the Czech Republic to cancel their votes. \nIn France almost 55 per cent of people voted No with 45 per cent in favour, with a turnout of 70 per cent. \nThe result in France was described as a \"political earthquake\" that would shake the foundations of the EU administration to its core. GETTY Mrs Le Pen is popular with the police force in France as she has pledged unwavering support \nThe Republic of France's monumental decision not to ratify the EU constitution sparked the same type of reaction as the British public who took to the streets to celebrate victory after the 2016 referendum. \nAt the time, one of the leading right-wing opponents of the treaty, Philippe de Villiers, declared: \"Europe has to be rebuilt. The constitution is no more.\" \nWhile European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso described the French vote as \"a very serious problem\". Things you didn't know about Marine Le Pen Mon, February 20, 2017 Marine Le Pen is a French politician who is the president of the National Front, a national-conservative political party in France and one of its main political forces. AFP/Getty Images 1 of 10 Described as more democratic and republican than her nationalist father, she has led a movement of \"de-demonization of the Front National\" to detoxify it and soften its image \nFrench Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin was quickly replaced by Dominique de Villepin and Nicolas Sarkozy became Minister of the Interior. \nSarkozy was then later elected as President of the French Republic in May 2007 and organised a renegotiation and ratification without a referendum, leaving the public furious. \nEventually he brought the Lisbon Treaty to Parliament, against the wishes of the 15,449,508 people who voted no, and pushed the treaty through instead.
