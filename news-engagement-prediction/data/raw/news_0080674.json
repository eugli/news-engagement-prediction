On CBS’“Late Show,” writers devised an opening segment in which presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway read an awards card telling them to “Stall,” rather than give out a “Best Picture” Oscar. On Comedy Central’s “Daily Show,” meanwhile, correspondent Roy Wood, Jr. suggested the “Moonlight” win showed America was operating “at maximum levels of black-tivity” with African-Americans winning much-deserved recognition for achievements. On TBS, Conan O’Brien did an elaborate piece suggesting all the different instructions that may have been on the card Beatty and Dunaway read. \nOf course, none of those hosts could offer the perspective of Jimmy Kimmel, the ABC late-night host who actually emceed last night’s event. Kimmel spent a good portion of the early part of the show simply recounting his impressions of the oddball twist of events, lending first-hand perspective to the incident. “It was not a prank.” Kimmel assured his audience and viewers. \nComedy Central’s Noah said the mix-up turned what is normally a staid affair into something quite different. “I’m going to start watching ‘Game of Thrones’ just to calm my nerves,” he quipped. \nThe jokes came as two of the programs featured appearances by other late-night luminaries. Noah interviewed John Oliver, while Colbert featured an appearance by Jon Stewart.
