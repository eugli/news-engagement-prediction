They haven't made a cent in two years. \n\"It's demoralising, depressing in a way,\" Michelle says. \n\"You get up and just deal with the most important thing first.\" Long days with little reward Photo: Graeme Hamilton milking cows on his farm at OB Flat in south-east South Australia. (ABC RN: Cass Steeth) \nEach morning they wake before dawn to milk their 500 cows using an electronic milking system. Their long days are filled with visits from specialists, managing deliveries and shifting cows. Then they milk the cows again in the afternoon. \nThey often work as late as 9pm, wake up early and do it all again. Employees help with milking, which takes the edge off all the early mornings â€” but the dairy never stops. \nAt 4am, wearing a floor-length plastic apron and grubby gumboots, Graeme is focused as he milks his cows. \n\"It's powered by vacuum, cup removal is powered electronically,\" he says. \nThe dairy is mostly automated, and the concrete shed is loud with the sounds of sucking and pumping. Photo: Graeme Hamilton rounding up cows. (ABC RN: Cass Steeth) \nBut the cows are peaceful and \"let down\" their milk easily; they're very accustomed to human interaction and being milked. \n\"While we're milking, we're not just blindly swapping cups over, we're checking for cow health, making sure that everybody's correctly fed and everybody's healthy,\" Graeme says. \nThe worn concrete floor of the dairy is padded with large foam squares that fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. The foundation is splattered with cow faeces and still-warm urine. But because cows mostly eat grass, the air has a natural, comforting scent. \nMr Hamilton hoses it all down after each group of cows moves through. He says these moments offer mild meditation and respite. Do we value our milk? Photo: One of the dairy calves on the farm of Michelle and Graeme Hamilton in South Australia. (ABC RN: Cass Steeth) \nThe Hamiltons have a strong Christian faith and try to minimise work on Sundays, but the stress of huge debts makes it difficult to get away from the farm. \nIn April 2016 Australia's largest dairy processors slashed their milk price below the cost of production , leaving farmers like the Hamiltons devastated. \nMichelle says she's fed up with an industry she believes is broken. \n\"There's an injustice to it. It's not morally right that we should accept all the risk for the dairy industry,\" she says. \nGraeme nods. \"We have no way, no escape. I don't think any of it is right.\" Photo: Graeme and Michelle Hamilton have been farming for almost four decades. (ABC RN: Cass Steeth) \nThe couple, who have farmed for almost four decades, were shell-shocked the day they heard Murray Goulburn had cut its milk price by about 10 per cent. \n\"You place your faith in the company you supply: that while we are busy doing the job we do, they are busy doing the job that they do,\" Michelle says. \n\"We were stunned when the rug was pulled out from under us.\" \nThe cuts were retrospective, and some farmers were left with debts of hundreds of thousands of dollars . Photo: Graeme says he feels a sense of place and belonging on the farm, which would be hard to walk away from. (ABC RN: Cass Steeth) \nDuring the 2015-16 financial year, Victorian dairy farmers made an average loss of $41,000 . For South Australian farmers it was a similar story, with the average farm's income decreasing by 27 per cent. \nThe Hamiltons themselves never calculated the debt they accrued from the Murray Goulburn collapse, and walked away from the co-operative. \n\"You leave a lot of friends behind,\" Michelle says. \nThe Australian Securities and Investment Commission , the Senate and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission have all launched investigations into the conduct and outlook of the industry. Why stay in a broken system? Photo: Michelle is an avid photographer and regularly goes out to take photos around their farm. (ABC RN: Cass Steeth) \nKnown by some friends as \"the queen of cows\", Michelle is an avid photographer. \n\"When I go out and walk through the herd, they are very peaceful with me just being there. I capture the unique way they play out their lives in the field,\" she says. \n\"I see them in a really beautiful and positive way, and I capture it through my lens.\" \nThe Hamiltons faith has also played an integral part in their decision to persevere in the industry. They attend the Mount Gambier Presbyterian Church each Sunday for worship. \n\"Our God is a god of hope,\" Michelle says. \n\"We get up knowing that it's not going to stay this way, it will turn around and we'll come out the other end. We just hang on.\" \nFor Graeme there's also a sense of place and belonging. \n\"The Aborigines of Australia say there's a connection with the land. Well, I can surely agree that there is and it grows the more you put into it,\" he says. \n\"It's very hard to walk away from that. \n\"I feel strongly about the responsibilities we have to each other as humans, to the environment we have and to our Lord.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T04:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:18:00.643+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
