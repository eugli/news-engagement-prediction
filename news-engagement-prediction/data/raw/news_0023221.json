And as one does when issues come up with a government official as important as president, Bannon’s constituents are sending him mail. \nBut before the letters and postcards get sent to the White House where President Bannon sits at a desk in the Oval Office (at least that’s how SNL envisions it), people are snapping shots of their political correspondence. \nThe hashtag #PostcardstoBannon includes tons of stamps, handwritten notes and letters addressed to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave with the words “Bannon” and “President” clearly labeled. \nLet’s just hope Trump doesn’t catch sight of all this correspondence for President Bannon.
