Never bet against Tom Brady.” \nGoehrke, a 20-year-old student, told the Kansas City Star last week : “I’ve been a big fan of hers for a couple of years now and I was going through Twitter and it was only the second quarter when I saw her tweet. \n“I just thought to myself it’s not over. That idea kind of just popped in my head, so I went through with it. \n“I thought maybe there was a chance she would respond, but I thought there was no chance she’d actually agree to it.” \nOn Wednesday, Bouchard followed through on the bet and tweeted a photo of the two of them in the backseat of a car with the caption “Just met my ‘Super Bowl Twitter Date’ John. On our way to the @BrooklynNets game!” Busy day with @si_swimsuit and then tonight… I'm going on a date 😉 pic.twitter.com/jNF5sokLNx \n— Genie Bouchard (@geniebouchard) February 15, 2017 Just met my 'Super Bowl Twitter Date' John 😊 On our way to the @BrooklynNets game! @punslayintwoods pic.twitter.com/DHRgY46smd \n— Genie Bouchard (@geniebouchard) February 16, 2017 \nBouchard later posted a video of her and her date sitting courtside as the Brooklyn Nets hosted the Milwaukee Bucks.
