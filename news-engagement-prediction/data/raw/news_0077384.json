What qualities do you need to be the first up the Red Bull 400 slope? Here’s the ideal profile. Ahmet Arslan is quite the example to follow © Samo Vidic/Red Bull Content Pool By Paul Gallo on 27 February 2017 \nFrom May 14, the ski jumps of the world will be snow free and ready to take on their summer job – becoming some of the steepest race tracks in the world for the lung-burning, leg-destroying Red Bull 400 . \nAt 14 stops around the world, including one World Championship race, hardcore runners will get chance to race to the top of these incredible inclines and add their name to the Red Bull 400 Hall of Fame. \nWhat are the principal qualities potential winners are going to need to haul themselves uphill to victory though? If you're thinking that you fit the bill, it can mean only two things: either victory is only 400m away, or you're over estimating your ability a bit. Read on to find out which. 15% of John McClane’s courage \nThe first 50m of the punishing 35° slope are your baptism of fire. Don't be scared of the effort, channel some Die Hard courage and go at it with everything you have. Afterall, it's not like you've got to jump out of a flaming building and land on a helicopter. 12% of Dalai Lama’s mind of steel \nOnce you get past the first 100m, the slope gains one degree. It might sound like a minor change, but in reality you'll quickly notice that this slight difference will set your calf muscles on fire, if they weren't already. Just try and stay zen, like His Holiness. 20% Rocky Balboa’s barrel chest \nAt altitude, oxygen levels diminish. So unless you're a skipping rope addict with a chest bigger than a small car, we don't want to crush your dreams but you'll most likely not be able to start signing Gonna Fly Now in the last few steps of the race with your fists raised high. 25% of Gregor Clegane’s endurance \nIs your nickname also 'The Mountain'? Do you have pain resistant muscles and a infallible second wind? Congratulations, that could make a whole world of difference at the last moment. 11% of Jean-Claude Van Damme’s flexibility \nThe first 300m of Red Bull 400 are a challenge, but not as much as the last 100m. By this time your legs will be so full of lactic acid you'll barely be able to move them. It's about this time that you'll be wishing for Van Damme levels of flexibility and leg strength. 5% of this cyclist’s self-confidence \nSelf-confidence, even if it means being borderline reckless, is necessary to win Red Bull 400 – no one ever won the race as a quivering wreck. Having the self belief of this track racer and the determination of a dog hanging onto the calf of the postman is absolutely vital to reach the top of the race course. \n3% of O-Zone’s stability \nThe important thing in any ascension is to keep both feet well planted on the ground, no matter what. This Romanian trio is the perfect example: they're able to sing standing on a plane's wing, so you're definitely capable of reaching the finish line of Red Bull 400. 0. 1% of Chuck Norris’s determination \nTo be able to cross the finish of Red Bull 400, you'll first have to get over a 5m high platform that's your access to the last straight. So don't underestimate these last few percent of effort: leg work and a vice-like grip are vital. If you're flagging, just ask yourself, 'What would Chuck do?' \n\nStill think you have all you need to win? If so, we'll see you at the top at one of the world's ski jump hills in celebration. Meanwhile, take a look at the video teaser below to a better idea of how it feels to put yourself through this race. Want more info?
