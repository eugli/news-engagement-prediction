The city is divided into 48 wards and each ward is represented by 3 members and the corporation is led by the Mayor of Pune. Alongside Pune, a number of other civic body polls are being held in Maharashtra including BMC, Pimpri Chinchwad, Nagpur, Nashik, Ulhasnagar, Thane, Solapur, Akola, Amravati and more.
