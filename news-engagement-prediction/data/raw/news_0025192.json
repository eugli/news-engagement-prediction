In December, longtime Googler Max Braun — who now works as a software lead on a robotics project at X — hacked together an automated stock-buying bot that analyzes the sentiment of Trump’s business-focused tweets in real-time and either buys or shorts shares instantly to capitalize on them.

He plans to donate all proceeds from to the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Resources Defense Council and Planned Parenthood. The bot made 22 trades between early December and this past Monday, turning an initial investment of $100,000 into $106,328 — a 6.3 percent return in two months. By comparison, the S&P 500 has gained 3.7 percent in the same time period. Braun says if the bot continues to trade like it has, it could achieve an annualized return of 43.5 percent. “Overall, the algorithm seems to succeed more often than not,” Braun wrote this week on Medium . “There are limits to the simulation and the underlying data, so take it all with a grain of salt.” He added, “...Don’t bet your life savings on it. Markets are unpredictable. Trump is unpredictable.” Braun said the idea came to him while on a flight to Europe, and he was able to get a working prototype up by the time the airplane landed. He’s one of a growing number of Silicon Valley engineers thinking of ways to use software to oppose Trump. In his case, he finds irony in using Trump’s tweets to fund organizations that have challenged the president’s early decisions in office.
