The unusual sight has gained popularity in recent years thanks to social media sharing of the phenomenon. 'People come from all over the world to see this,' said National Park Service spokesman Scott Gediman, according to CNN . The fall is over 1,500 feet and this year was particularly big because of lots of seasonal rainfall and snow The phenomenon can be seen from many places in Yosemite Valley but the website says the best spot is at El Capitan picnic area Photographs line areas seeking that perfect shot - but if the weather isn't clear, won't get it The sight didn't disappoint those who made the trek this year. 'This year, I feel fortunate to have been one of the firsts to witness it. In fact, I just drove back home after seeing this unforgettable moment,' wrote photographer Sangeeta Day, who captured the magnificent sight last year too. The natural wonder isn't that easy to catch. For one, it doesn't last long. 'After claiming our spot in the picnic area and waiting over THREE hours, it wasn't until we all were ready to pack up in failure that the clouds finally parted for the setting sun to light up the falls not just once, but THREE times, only for a few fleeting moments. Worth it,' wrote photographer Alex Chiu on Instagram. Hopefuls have to first get to Horsetail Fall, which is 1,570 feet high, with the best viewing spot being the El Capitan picnic area, says the park's website . Then there are the roads. 'This trip almost didn't happen due to the crazy road conditions at Yosemite,' photographer Ray Lee posted on Instagram. 'For those that plan on going to see this, be careful since there has been so much water that some of the roads are falling apart.' The optical illusion usually starts on February 16 but this year started early, on the 12th The weather has to be clear in order for the sun's rays to shift down enough to hit the falls Then there's just the matter of never quite knowing when exactly it will happen. Normally it's between February 16th and 23rd, but it came early this year. 'If conditions are not perfect, the Yosemite Firefall will not glow,' warns the website. There needs to be enough snow packed to melt into a decent waterfall in February. Temperatures must be warm enough during the day to melt the snow. The phenomenon was first photographed in 1973 but recently became a global interest RELATED ARTICLES", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T09:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T05:39:43.230+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
