resulting in them falling straight into the crowd.\nWhoops! Things did not run completely smoothly during Katy Perry's performance at the BRITs on Wednesday night, after one of her backing dancers took an embarrassing tumble off stage\nDressed bizarrely as the White House in her politically-themed number, a whole host of dancers had arrived onstage behind the Roar singer to enhance her upbeat set.\nHowever things soon went awry for one performer on the end, who appeared to lose his footing beneath the bulky costume - which sent him flying off stage and into the crowds.\nCaptured on camera by a fan, the performer is seen on the floor beside the stage before a number of crew come rushing over to help him up after the mishap.\nStarting off well: While the 32-year-old (above) belted out her new hit Chained To The Rhythm, one of her dancer's was caught on camera tripping and falling during the routine\nBig moment: Dressed bizarrely as a white house, a whole host of dancers had arrived onstage behind the Roar singer to enhance her upbeat set\nThe incident did not go unnoticed by eagle-eyed fans however - who took to Twitter to express their utter hilarity at the event.\nOne wrote alongside a huge number of laughing emojis: 'Have watched Katy Perry's 'house dancer' falling off the stage 135 times now...'\nMeanwhile another added, clearly in stitches: 'It probably makes me evil, but I could watch this all day!' before asking in concern: '@katyperry is your dancer ok?!'\nLike a house on fire: However things soon went awry for the dancer, who appeared to lose his footing beneath the bulky costume - which sent him flying off stage and into the crowds\nIn stitches: The incident did not go unnoticed by eagle-eyed fans however - who took to Twitter to express their utter hilarity at the event\nMeanwhile other keen fans observes that this was not the first time Katy had suffered such a mishap - referring to her performance at the 2015 Super Bowl.\nQuote: : 'Can Katy Perry do a performance where a dancer doesn't mess it up?!' while another added: 'Oh I am weak, this is left shark all over again!'\nThe viewers were referring to the 'left shark' incident at the sporting event two years ago - which saw Katy upstaged by her out of time dancer, who was dressed as the underwater predator.\nAll round the houses: Katy Perry literally brought the house down as she performed her new track Chained To The Rhythm with Skip Marley\nA job well done: Skip and Katy held each other's hands triumphantly aloft as the final notes rang out as the audience applauded\nWithin minutes of the blunder, the costumed dancer had been created his own Twitter account by entertained followers.\nKaty had certainly made an impression as she arrived at the ceremony inside London 's O2 Arena earlier that evening however - as she dazzled in a glitzy thigh-skimming minidress and matching blazer.\nThe American songstress dazzled in the lavish co-ords which were embellished with silver sequins and fine tassels.\nDazzling: Katy Perry, 32, certainly made an impression as she arrived at the ceremony inside London's O2 Arena on Wednesday night in a glitzy thigh-skimming minidress and matching blazer\nHer jacket boasted pink silk lapels which complemented her metallic heels, and she accessorised with a bronze choker.\nThe California girl scraped her hair tightly back into a series of small topknots and decorated her face with perfectly groomed tinted brows, pink lipstick and lengthy lashes.\nKaty modelled her outfit from all angles and her envy-inducing limbs appeared to go on forever.\nGlitzy: The American songstress dazzled in the lavish co-ords which were embellished with silver sequins and fine tassels\nBelle of the ball: Katy was up there with the most glamorous on the night\nSmile! Katy flashed a cheeky smile over her shoulder\nThe 37th BRIT Awards ceremony features a star-studded line-up with Ed Sheeran, Robbie Williams, Little Mix, Bruno Mars, The 1975, Emeli Sandé and Skepta all taking the stage.\nEmma Willis and Dermot O'Leary present the show after being drafted in when Michael Buble was forced to pull out due to his son's battle with cancer.\n'The BRITs is an iconic show that I've watched and attended many times,' said Dermot about his hosting duties. 'It's a holy grail for a broadcaster, and I'm really looking forward to working with Emma, who I'm a big fan of, and celebrating a brilliant year of British music.'\nTidy: The California girl scraped her hair tightly back into a series of small topknots\nSmouldering: Katy decorated her face with perfectly groomed tinted brows, pink lipstick and lengthy lashes\nHappy to be here: The star looked genuinely thrilled to be in attendance\n'To present the BRITs is an honour but to be doing it alongside one of my absolute favourites, Mr Dermot O'Leary is just bonkers. Bring on the BRITs 2017,' added Emma.\nLittle Mix and Grime artist Skepta lead the nominations pack with three apiece - with many critics wondering if the North London-born MC can replicate his prestigious Mercury Music Prize win and scoop the British Album of The Year prize for Konnichiwa.\nBut he has stiff competition from the late David Bowie whose last album Blackstar is up for the gong, as well as fan favourite The 1975 whose memorably titled album I Like It When You Sleep For You Are Beautiful Yet So Unaware Of It, topped both the U.S. and UK charts.\nSkepta will also go up against firm favourite Bowie in the Best British Male category, while fellow nominee Craig David is convinced he won't win the award.\n'David Bowie's career has been so epic,' he told BBC News . 'He influenced me and so many other artists. There's no competition.'\nLeggy display: Her jacket boasted pink silk lapels which complemented her metallic heels, and she accessorised with a bronze choker\nQuite the spectacle: Katie will perform her new single Chained to the Rhthym\nLittle Mix - and bandmember Perrie Edwards - have a battle of their own, with Perrie's ex-boyfriend Zayn Malik both nominated for Best British single - Zayn for R&B style Pillowtalk and Little Mix for their hit Shout Out To My Ex, which fans believe is partly written about the former One Direction star.\nInterestingly, Beyonce goes against sister Solange for the Best International Female gong, although they both face stiff competition from rising star Christine And The Queens, Rihanna and Sia.\nSolange, who considers Beyonce a role model, released her album A Seat At The Table just three days before her thirtieth birthday last year, to critical acclaim.\nIt became her first number-one album in the US, making she and Beyonce the first sisters to have US number-one albums in a calendar year.\nGlamour girl: The hitmaker's makeup was flawlessly applied\nMeanwhile, Best British Female Solo Artist will be fought out between Anonhni, Ellie Goulding, Emeli Sande, Lianne La Havas and Nao.\nAdele will be hoping to replicate a tiny slice of her recent Grammy success by scooping the British Artist Video Of The Year award for Send My Love (To Your New Lover).\nHowever, she faces a tough contest with Calvin Harris Feat. Rihanna, whose video for This Is What You Came For has been a frontrunner with the bookies.\nBlues Singer Rag 'N' Bone Man has already secured his first BRIT, scooping the Critics Choice gong - one of two awards already announced.\nThe award - given to artists tipped for the top - is held in high regard, having previously been presented to Adele, Sam Smith and Florence + The Machine.\n'I thought they had made a mistake. I was up against two pop giants. It’s bloody brilliant! I'm crazy happy. Proper massive grin,' he said about his win when it was announced last year.\nAnd Robbie Williams will accept the BRITs Icon Award - which provides him with his 18th BRIT award win, either as a solo artist or member of Take That.\nThe singer seemed a little bemused at being selected to receive the prestigious prize, which sees him follow in the footsteps of Elton John and David Bowie.\n'There’s so much in my career where I look into the abyss and the abyss looks back and goes: \"I don’t know, I don’t have a f**king clue,\"' he recently told NME .\n'How have I got 18 BRITs and Paul McCartney hasn’t? Something weird has happened... Me having 18 BRITs – it’s like there’s a glitch in the Matrix. But, you know I’m not going to give them back and I’m glad it’s happened to me.'\nBRIT AWARDS 2017 - THE WINNERS BRITISH MALE SOLO ARTIST\nDavid Bowie - WINNER\nCraig David\nKano\nMichael Kiwanuka\nSkepta\nBRITISH FEMALE SOLO ARTIST\nEmeli Sandé - WINNER\nAnohni\nEllie Goulding\nLianne La Havas\nNao\nBRITISH GROUP\nThe 1975 - WINNER\nBastille\nBiffy Clyro\nLittle Mix\nRadiohead\nBRITISH BREAKTHROUGH ACT\nRag'n'Bone Man - WINNER\nAnne-Marie\nBlossoms\nSkepta\nStormzy\nBRITISH SINGLE\nLittle Mix - Shout Out To My Ex - WINNER\nAlan Walker - Faded\nCalum Scott - Dancing On My Own\nCalvin Harris Ft Rihanna - This Is What You Came For\nClean Bandit- Rockabye\nColdplay - Hymn For The Weekend\nJames Arthur - Say You Won't Let Go\nJonas Blue & Dakota - Fast Car\nTinie Tempah Ft Zara Larsson - Girls Like\nZayn - Pillowtalk\nBRITISH ALBUM OF THE YEAR\nDavid Bowie - Blackstar - WINNER\nThe 1975 - I Like It When You Sleep For You Are Beautiful Yet So Unaware Of It\nKano - Made In the Manor\nMichael Kiwanuka - Love & Hate\nSkepta Konnichiwa\nBRITISH ARTIST VIDEO OF THE YEAR\nOne Direction - History - WINNER\nAdele - Send My Love (To Your New Lover)\nCalvin Harris Ft Rihanna - This Is What You Came For\nClean Bandit Ft Sean Paul & Anne-Marie - Rockabye\nColdplay - Hymn For The Weekend\nJames Arthur - Say You Won't Let Go\nJonas Blue & Dakota - Fast Car\nLittle Mix Ft Sean Paul - Hair\nTinie Tempah Ft Zara Larsson - Girls Like\nZayn - Pillowtalk\nINTERNATIONAL MALE SOLO ARTIST\nDrake -WINNER\nBon Iver\nBruno Mars\nLeonard Cohen\nThe Weeknd\nINTERNATIONAL FEMALE SOLO ARTIST\nBeyonce - WINNER\nChristine and the Queens\nRihanna\nSia\nSolange\nINTERNATIONAL GROUP\nA Tribe Called Quest - WINNER\nKings Of Leon\nDrake And Future\nNick Cave And the Bad Seeds\nTwenty-One Pilots", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/articles/15d753be-7502-4ebe-88d0-3281e4a841d2", "http://www.nme.com/", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-23T01:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:09:45.865+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
