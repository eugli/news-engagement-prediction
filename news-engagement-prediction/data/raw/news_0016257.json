(Supplied: Hannah Tweed) \nVictorian grazier Scott Tweed says western Queensland is the \"land of opportunity\" for their breeding operation. \nSupplied: Hannah Tweed Close \nA Victorian grazier says steep property prices pushed his family to look north into Queensland to expand their beef operation. \nScott Tweed and his brother Cameron recently purchased Gunnadorah Station, a 50,000-hectare property 60 kilometres north of Quilpie. \nMr Tweed said they would use the new acquisition as a breeding block for Ultrablack cattle, complementing the family's other holdings in southern New South Wales and northern Victoria. \n\"We sort of had a look around and thought we've got plenty of good fattening country and growing out country, and it was time to take the next step forward and grab some good breeding country,\" Mr Tweed said. \n\"So we've been having a look around for a while and Quilpie was something that fitted the bill for us.\" \nThe property was sold for an average of $26 per acre, which Mr Tweed said was better value for money for a breeding operation when compared to other regions they looked at closer to Victoria. \nHe said land value had increased exponentially in northern Victoria, and he described it as \"getting out of control\" for breeding operations. Low rainfall, no concern \nThough south-west Queensland's low rainfall presented a risk, Mr Tweed said the river country and available Mulga for drought fodder provided security. \n\"We look at it as a bit of a land of opportunity as well and you look at the likes of the Gibsons, who we bought the place off, and I think they've proven they can run a very successful operation predominantly in the western country,\" Mr Tweed said. \n\"The one big thing is the economy of scale and the other thing is being able to have some inside country or country that we've got down south here to back up in the tougher seasons.\" \nMr Tweed also said flood country was a big selling point when deciding to snap up the Queensland property. \n\"We're very focussed on river country, creek country, flood country,\" he said. \n\"Both our properties down here, we're on the Loddon River where I am in Victoria and Cameron's on the Bulla Tail Creek between the Murray and the Edwards River around Deniliquin. \n\"We've always maintained a focus on flood country.\" \nMr Tweed said they would initially focus on getting calves on the ground at Gunnadorah, before deciding whether to sell offspring via Auctions Plus or send them down to his Victorian property to finish. \nTrucks loaded with the Tweeds' cattle are expected to roll into Quilpie at the end of the month.
