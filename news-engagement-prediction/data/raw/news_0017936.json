Richard Noone Central Coast Gosford Express Advocate Share Share on Twitter \nA MAN sent “psychotic” from smoking too many cannabis “cones” tried to flee the scene of a crash that left a woman permanently brain damaged, on a skateboard, a court has heard. \nKayden James Lawson, of Killarney Vale, was stopped by a hitchhiker on the M1 motorway about 1km away from where he ploughed into another motorist after travelling an estimated 200km/h in the breakdown lane while high on pot. \nAt his sentencing hearing this morning at Gosford District Court his solicitor Brad Kernick appealed for the “moral culpability” to be considered lower than the guideline judgment — a series of High Court precedents that instructs judges when sentencing — because he suffered from schizophrenia which was not diagnosed until after the crash.

Picture: Westpac Rescue Helicopter Source: Supplied \nHe told the court Lawson was admitted to Wyong Emergency as a non-voluntary patient after the crash suffering a “psychosis” and had since spent seven months in a mental health facility. \n“In my respectful submission Mr Lawson deserves to have the moral culpability reduced,” Mr Kernick told the court. \nHowever Crown prosecutor Charisse Hodgeman said there were medical reports tendered as part of the brief of evidence which revealed he was smoking four to five cones a day and at least three cones a day in the 12 months leading up to the crash.

Picture: Twitter Source: Twitter \nMs Hodgeman said the medical evidence indicated he ended up in hospital from a “drug-induced psychosis” and that it was the cannabis that was a contributing factor to his mental state, more so than an underlying existing condition. \n“In relation to the object seriousness [there is the] gross abandonment of responsibility as a road user and the catastrophic injuries [to the victim],” she said. \nLawson, a P-plater, was estimated to be travelling more than 200km/h swerving in and out of traffic and along the breakdown lane on November 10, 2014 when he slammed into the back of Kristyn Rouke’s Toyota Hilux at 6.48am.

Source: News Corp Australia \nShe said while she had no memory of the crash and post traumatic amnesia for 64 days after she woke from her coma, knowing he “basically left me for dead” trying to flee the scene “upsets me greatly”. \n“I sustained an extremely severe traumatic brain injury, plus multiple other severe injuries including right ear amputation, right face/scalp de-gloving, C2 hangman (neck) fracture, left arm fracture and my left radial nerve was severed,” she said in her statement. \n“Over the past two years I’ve endured multiple operations plus I have numerous ongoing rehabilitation and medical appointments, several per week. \n“I needed to relearn the basics, such as walking, talking, writing, eating, brushing my teeth and decision making.” \nTOP TEN COOL HACKS TO TAKE ON THE HEATWAVE Top ten cool hacks to take on the Sydney heatwave 0:43 \nTake a look at the top ten cool hacks to survive the Sydney heatwave.
