I freaked out a little bit and thought worst case scenario, he's dead. \n\"I posted on Facebook 'Rest in peace, Skipper'. I've had him for eight years … he's like a dog for me, he's my pet.\" \nAfter cleaning out the pond and swimming pool filters to check for his turtle, Mr Watson resigned himself to life without Skipper. ABC Riverland: Catherine Heuzenroeder \nOn Tuesday morning Mr Watson scrolled through a Riverland pets forum on Facebook and saw a post from a woman who had found a turtle in her driveway. \n\"I was a bit sceptical to start with. I thought this is a long shot. But no, it's him … I still can't get over it,\" Mr Watson said. \nSkipper has a distinctive thumb-shaped indent on the back of his shell where Mr Watson pressed too hard when he was little. \n\"That's how I recognised him, and knew he was mine,\" he said. Pet reunions that defy the odds \nThere have been some remarkable reunions between pets and their owners.
