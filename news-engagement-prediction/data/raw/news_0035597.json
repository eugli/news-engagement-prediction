Before that, he spent nearly a year and a half as creative director on Nike Basketball for R/GA following a freelance stint with Google and worked on the “Unexpected Moves” campaign. He previously spent nearly six years with 72andSunny New York as a copywriter and creative director, working with clients including ESPN, Samsung, K-Swiss, Sonos, Activision and Shock Top. Among the highlights of Kamath’s time with 72andSunny are his work on an Eastbound and Down-themed campaign for K-Swiss and an effort for Samsung promoting the Samsung Galaxy exclusive release of Jay Z’s Magna Carta Holy Grail album. \nJohnson served as group strategy director at 72andSunny for nearly four years before leaving to found Haymaker. He originally joined 72andSunny as a strategy director in December 2011. He helped the agency win new accounts including ESPN, Coors Light , Instagram and Adidas, and worked on the CKE Restaurants account. Before joining 72andSunny, Johnson spent nearly three and a half years as a senior planner and planning director with 180LA, working with brands including Adidas Basketball and Boost Mobile. “The days of strategy and creative staying in their respective corners are over,” Johnson said in a statement. “Clients have no shortage of content options available to them, but what they’re demanding more of is agile thought leadership. Putting creative and strategy together as the team from go helps us efficiently and effectively fill that demand.” Added Kamath, “Our goal is to create a new generation of strategically minded creatives, one that isn’t content to just be slapped onto the end of a process, but one that solves business problems by being involved from strategy inception through creative execution.” Kamath says the agency’s name, taken from a powerful punch in boxing, refers to how “m odern brands are fighting to land their point of view and be remembered.” “We have a history of landing ideas that leave a lasting impression with people, transcend media and move the needle for our partners. Leaving our mark is what HAYMAKER is all about,” he said. Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T02:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:58:13.497+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
