The City of Victoria for its over budget and delayed plan to replace its 93-year-old Johnson St. Bridge. That budget has ballooned to $105 million from the original $63 million in 2009. Ontario’s provincial government was also honoured with the Lifetime Achievement Award for its handling of the energy file. In her 2015 annual report, Ontario’s auditor general found consumers paid $37 billion above market price for energy between 2006 and 2014, and estimated that current energy policies would cost Ontarians another $133 billion by 2032, according to the taxpayers federation. \nWATCH: City of Victoria, B.C. wins Canadian Taxpayers Federation award for municipal waste © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
