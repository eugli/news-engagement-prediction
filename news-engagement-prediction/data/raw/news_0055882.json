In response to Computer Graphic +'s Star Wars: reimagined contest , artist Lap Pun Cheung merged Star Wars with Studio Ghibli . \nThe contest, which is now over, involved fans from all over the world submitting art of their favorite Star Wars characters reimagined into other fandoms. Cheung revealed that even though he missed entering the actual contest, he decided to create \"A Hero's Tale\" and \"Duel of the Fates\" anyways. His other one, \"Darth Ghibli's Entrance,\" was a response to Brainstorm's Darth Vader and Stormtrooper challenge on Facebook. \nAnd after seeing Cheung's imaginative drawings, we're rooting for him in the next contest! We're also predicting this won't be the last time you see a Star Wars crossover; remember Sleeping Beauty as a Stormtrooper ?
