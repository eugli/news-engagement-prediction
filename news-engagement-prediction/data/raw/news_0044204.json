(Southern Illinois) More If I told you that you were about to watch an inside-the-park grand slam, you’d probably think that’s pretty exciting, right? Fact is, any kind of inside-the-park home run is among the most exciting things that can happen on a baseball field.\n[ Sign up for Yahoo Fantasy Baseball | 2017 Player Rankings ]\nHow might you make an inside-the-park home run even more wild? How about adding an outfielder running through the outfield wall? Enter Austin Bogart, the left fielder for Stetson University, who did this Sunday:\nHow do you hit an inside-the-park grand slam? Stetson LF Austin Bogart literally runs through the wall. (He's OK). pic.twitter.com/t43zYOjLZB\n— Saluki Baseball (@SIU_Baseball) February 19, 2017\nYep, that’s quite a moment. Bogart ran into the portion of the left-field wall that opens to bring the batting cage onto the field. So it wasn’t quite the Incredible Hulk smashing through an outfield fence, but it still stopped Bogart in his tracks.\nAs this was happening, Jake Hand of Southern Illinois — who lined the ball into left — was racing around the bases. Southern Illinois had an 8-0 lead after the inside-the-park grand slam. They eventually won the game 8-4.\nAt least no one can doubt Austin Bogart’s effort.\nMore MLB coverage from Yahoo Sports:\n– – – – – –\nMike Oz is the editor of Big League Stew on Yahoo Sports.
