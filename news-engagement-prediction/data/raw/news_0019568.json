The previous record had belonged to Australia's David Warner. \nHe was eventually out in the final over of the innings, caught on the boundary while looking for a six that would take him past Gary Kirsten's 188, the highest individual one day international score by a South African. \nFarhaan Behardien ended with a impressive 36 off just 20 balls. \nSri Lanka certainly have it all to do in their turn at the crease as the team batting second has only won six out of 28 one day internationals at the ground.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T22:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:26:47.955+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
