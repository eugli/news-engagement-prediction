It looks like just about every monster is teased in someway at least, via a smokey wall of faces. \nA Dalek, Cyberman and Ice Warrior are all immediately obvious, plus what looks like a Weeping Angel, and the Emoji Robots we've previous seen. Some people are also seeing Autons but seeing as that's basically 'a face' I'm not sure. There's also a Waters of Mars suggestion floating around and some people pointing out one face's resemblance to Davros. \nHere's a nice break down Taking a stab at analysing that #TimeForHeroes #DoctorWho trailer. I spot #Daleks, #Cybermen, and #IceWarriors. pic.twitter.com/J9S5muuxAN February 25, 2017 \nFrom the same source we've also got what looks like some episode titles. Book titles at 0:13 - Thin Ice a reference to @bigfinish 7th Doctor story? #DoctorWho #TimeForHeroes pic.twitter.com/pLIE8lfnma February 25, 2017 \nThen there's what I can only assume is the big bad at the end. \nThat looks a lot like a lady Ice Warrior. Is she the main villain of the series given her prominent placing? \nHowever, the biggest potential bombshell is a face that looks a bit like the eighth Doctor, Paul McGann. Likely meaningless outside of the Ice Warrior connection, but... OMG, Paul McGann is returning to #DoctorWho! #TimeForHeroes pic.twitter.com/SySDRkOnSd February 25, 2017 \nFinally a lot of people are picking up on new companion Bill, played by Pearl Mackie, talking about about having the time of her life even if it kills her . That almost seems too obvious. We'll start getting some answers out on April 15 when the new season starts. \nSeen something newsworthy?
