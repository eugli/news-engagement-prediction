This year we felt that they had been educated enough.” (A group of about 20 music industry experts decides annually on a short list of two-dozen nominees, half performers and half nonperformers, five of whom are then chosen for induction by about 1,500 voting members.) “Jay Z is pop music but presents it in a different manner,” Ms. Moran said. “This just shows that we accept it and acknowledge that. It’s a step into the future. We can’t nurture young songwriters if we can’t accept them and grow with them.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story She added that Jay Z was “so over the moon” about his induction. “He was flipping out, he was going crazy,” she said.

Congratulations to @S_C_ , the first rapper to be inducted into the prestigious Songwriters Hall Of Fame. #SHOF2017 pic.twitter.com/SUpistREN5 — TIDAL (@TIDALHiFi) Feb. 22, 2017 The rest of this year’s group is split between the traditional oldies contingent and more modern sounds. In addition to Mr. Gordy, who wrote with the Jackson 5, Marvin Gaye and the Supremes, and the Chicago trio (“Saturday in the Park,” “If You Leave Me Now”), there is Mr. Martin, the architect of turn-of-the-century teen pop from the Backstreet Boys (“I Want It That Way”), ’NSync (“It’s Gonna Be Me”) and Britney Spears (“…Baby One More Time”). Though typically understated, preferring to toil behind the scenes, he has remained relevant in this decade with additional smash singles performed by the Weeknd, Taylor Swift and Katy Perry. Babyface, a founder of LaFace Records whose solo hits include “When Can I See You” and “Whip Appeal,” has written for Boyz II Men, Whitney Houston and Eric Clapton. The duo of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, initially known as members of the Prince-affiliated band the Time, went on to create the sound of Janet Jackson’s solo renaissance , while also writing for Mariah Carey, Mary J. Blige, Usher and Gwen Stefani.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:10:17.415+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
