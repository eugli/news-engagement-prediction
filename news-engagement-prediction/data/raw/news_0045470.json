Audio from a 2016 episode of “The Drunken Peasants” podcast, in which Yiannopoulos, 32, was heard discussing the age of consent for sexual relationships, led many to say he was condoning pedophilia.\nIn the clip, the openly gay British journalist was asked about “the whole consent thing.”\n“It’s not this black and white thing that people try to paint it,” the interviewer said. “Are there some 13-year-olds out there capable of giving informed consent to have sex with an adult? Probably…”\nYiannopoulos responded to the inquiry by asserting “the law is probably about right, that’s probably roughly the right age. I think it’s probably about OK, but there are certain people who are capable of giving consent at a younger age. I certainly consider myself to be one of them, people who are sexually active younger. I think it particularly happens in the gay world, by the way.”\n\nMilo Yiannopoulos holds a press conference near Pulse Nightclub after the shooting, Jun. 15, 2016.

Yiannopoulos was promptly dropped as the keynote speaker for the Conservative Political Action Committee’s yearly conference after the group said he was “condoning pedophilia.” Simon and Schuster, with whom Yiannopoulos had signed a book deal  that included a $250,000 advance, also dropped him. Fox Business reported that Breitbart might fire him as editor, as well.\nRelated Stories Breitbart Could Fire Yiannopoulos Over Pedophilia Comments CPAC Slams Milo Yiannopoulos For Pedophilia Yiannopoulos attempted to clarify the comments in a Facebook post entitled \"A note for idiots.\"\n“I do not support pedophilia. Period. It is a vile and disgusting crime, perhaps the very worst,” he wrote. “There are selectively edited videos doing the rounds, as part of a coordinated effort to discredit me from establishment Republicans, that suggest I am soft on the subject.”\nYiannopoulos was expected to speak about his future at Breitbart during the 3 p.m. ET press conference in New York City, which can be streamed live below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:54:05.760+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
