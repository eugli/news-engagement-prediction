I´m the type of person that if I like a TV show, I´ll binge watch ... \nThe #DCEU has not been doing well. Out of three movies initially slated for 2018, The Batman , The Flash and Aquaman , only the latter remains. Despite all the negativity the project has received, things have been going rather well for the aquatic hero's solo movie. Just last month, James Wan shared a picture of himself alongside Jason Momoa, Amber Heard, and Patrick Wilson during a table read. Rumors for the casting of Aquaman's parents came out, and more recently, Yahya Abdul-Mateen was cast as the main baddie, Black Manta .

The website Acting Auditions put out a casting call for the film; in it, it's revealed production will begin on May 22 in Australia. And through the announcement, a logline for the film was released, giving us a little clue for what to expect from the plot: \n\"'Aquaman' will center on Aquaman as a reluctant ruler of the underwater kingdom of Atlantis who is caught between land dwellers that are always polluting the globe and his own people who are ready to invade the surface.\" \nThis reveals a very important aspect about the movie. It's a superhero film, therefore we already know a bad guy will be there for Aquaman to fight. However, #JamesWan seems to be going back to basics with his superhero storytelling by giving the protagonist various concerns of a different nature. [Credit: Warner Bros.] \nIn this case, pollution, the imminent invasion of surface dwellers, a treacherous brother and a maniac dressed in a black scuba suit. Wow... that's a lot to handle. \nThat wasn't all the #Aquaman goodness this piece gave us though. A short while ago, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Nicole Kidman was in talks to join the film as Arthur Curry's mother. Atlanna [Credit: DC Comics] \nJust after, it was revealed that Temuera Morrison was in talks to portray Arthur's father . Being \"in talks\" does not guarantee an actor has been cast, so everything was in the air... until now, as the logline just confirmed the pair's casting: \n\"Screen Actors Guild Award nominee Jason Momoa will play Aquaman. Also starring is Academy Award winner Nicole Kidman as Atlanna , Hollywood Film Awards winner Amber Heard as Mera, two-time Academy Award nominee Willem Dafoe as Nuidis Vulko, two-time Golden Globe Award nominee Patrick Wilson as Orm/Ocean Master, New Zealand Film and TV Awards winner Temuera Morrison as Thomas Curry , and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Black Manta.\" \nSee Also: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:19:20.374+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
