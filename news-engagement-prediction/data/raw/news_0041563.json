They began making plans last month to make the case for the arts to their audiences, their well-connected board members and Congress. Mr. Gelb, the general manager of the Met, had planned to tout the company’s recently announced 2017-18 season during the intermission of Saturday afternoon’s broadcast of Bellini’s “I Puritani,” which was heard on more than 500 radio stations and in 46 states. Instead, he began by speaking of the possible cuts — and noting that many of the radio stations carrying the broadcast would face serious cuts if the Corporation for Public Broadcasting was eliminated. “I think it’s really important that people be aware of this: The possibility of losing the arts on the radio, losing the arts on television, losing the arts altogether is very real if these cuts were to go through,” Mr. Gelb said. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Marie-Hélène Bernard, the president and chief executive of the St. Louis Symphony, said the orchestra had drafted a letter to its board members urging them to call their elected officials. “We asked them to let them know why it’s important,” she said. And Andrew Kipe, the executive director of the Louisville Orchestra in Kentucky, a highly regarded ensemble recovering from a recent bankruptcy, said that orchestra officials had already planned to go to Washington on March 20 for an advocacy day organized by Americans for the Arts, a network of cultural organizations, but that now the trip had taken on greater urgency. He said that the orchestra had received $15,000 from the National Endowment for the Arts to support its Festival of American Music, and added that he hoped to meet with members of the state’s congressional delegation, including Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, to explain why the orchestra is vital. “When we get to D.C. next month, we will have some real facts and figures — on job creation, economic impact — besides just arguing that funding the arts is good because it’s a good thing,” Mr. Kipe said, adding that the arts had bipartisan support in Kentucky. “The return on a relatively small investment is pretty great.” Some administrators alluded to reports that the Trump administration was seeking the cuts to the arts in part so it could increase spending on the military. Janne Sirén, the director of the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, said in an email: “As a museum director and as a reserve Finnish special forces paratrooper, I see no conflict when a government supports both the armed forces and the cultural forces of a nation.” But as some top administrators geared up for battle, they acknowledged a feeling of déjà vu — recalling the battles over arts funding that raged decades ago during the Reagan administration, and later when Newt Gingrich was the House speaker. “It’s fascinating: Now I’ve been working in this field for so long that we’ve gone full circle and gone right back to again defending the role of the N.E.A.,” said Deborah F. Rutter, the president of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, who previously led the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the Seattle Symphony. “The funding is important, and it’s symbolic,” she said. “It is art and culture which defines us.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T07:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T07:37:19.828+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
