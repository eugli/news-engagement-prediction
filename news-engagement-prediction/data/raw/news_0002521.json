Everything You Need to Know About Trump’s Supreme Court Pick Gorsuch is viewed in conservative circles as an intellectual heir to the late Antonin Scalia. by Twitter By Ken Lyon/Denver Post/Getty Images. After making a show of summoning his two Supreme Court finalists to Washington to square off in a reality-TV style showdown, Donald Trump chose Neil Gorsuch, a 49-year-old judge on the 10th Circuit Court, as his nominee to replace the late Antonin Scalia. Gorsuch, a Harvard Law graduate with degrees from Columbia and Oxford, previously served as a clerk for Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy of the Supreme Court and Justice Department official before being nominated by George W. Bush to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals. “Today I am keeping another promise to the American people by nominating Judge Neil Gorsuch of the United States Supreme Court to be of the United States Supreme Court,”Trump said in a statement Tuesday night in a pre-planned, primetime announcement. “So was that a surprise? Was it?” (Judge Thomas Hardiman, Trump’s other finalist for the gig, will remain in Philadelphia overseeing the 3rd Circuit.) “Mr. President, I am honored and I am humbled,” Gorsuch said after Trump’s introduction, going on to deliver a well-spoken paean to Scalia and his family. Gorsuch is admired in conservative circles, where he is seen as an intellectual heir to Scalia, making him a fitting successor on the Supreme Court. “The great compliment that Gorsuch’s legal writing is in a class with Scalia’s is deserved,” SCOTUSblog notes : \nGorsuch’s opinions are exceptionally clear and routinely entertaining; he is an unusual pleasure to read, and it is always plain exactly what he thinks and why. Like Scalia, Gorsuch also seems to have a set of judicial/ideological commitments apart from his personal policy preferences that drive his decision-making. He is an ardent textualist (like Scalia); he believes criminal laws should be clear and interpreted in favor of defendants even if that hurts government prosecutions (like Scalia); he is skeptical of efforts to purge religious expression from public spaces (like Scalia); he is highly dubious of legislative history (like Scalia); and he is less than enamored of the dormant commerce clause (like Scalia) Liberals may find Gorsuch palatable enough, too. The Colorado native comes with the proper pedigree, and is widely considered to be an adroit legal scholar. While he is plainly a conservative pick, he has enough bipartisan credibility to pass the test of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who said Sunday that Democrats would stonewall any candidate who is “out of the mainstream.” ( Norm Eisen , the former Obama ethics czar who attended Harvard Law with Gorsuch and Barack Obama , tweeted that he was a “great guy.”) Ultimately, Gorsuch’s credentials likely matter less to Democrats than their own internal politics. As party leaders discussed during a closed-door retreat in West Virginia last week, Democrats may have little choice but to filibuster Trump’s pick if they don’t want to find themselves facing primary challenges from the progressive base come 2018. At the same time, deploying the filibuster too soon could incite the wrath of Republicans, who could use the so-called “nuclear option” to destroy the Supreme Court filibuster, eliminating leverage Democrats may need in the future if yet another court seat opens up. While Gorsuch’s confirmation would merely revert the political balance on the Supreme Court to where it was before Scalia died, the next death or retirement could mean a seismic ideological shift. Still, Gorsuch has enough political baggage to stir up a raucous confirmation battle regardless. Conservatives and liberals alike believe that he could vote to overturn Roe v. Wade , based on his publications on the topic of assisted suicide, and his opinions on Hobby Lobby. It is also an open question how his prior relationship with Kennedy could influence either man on the court. “The real appeal of Gorsuch nomination is he’s likely to be the most effective conservative nominee in terms of winning over Anthony Kennedy and forging conservative decisions on the court,” Jeffrey Rosen , of the National Constitution Center, told Politico , throwing cold water on the idea that Kennedy might be a moderating influence on Gorsuch. “He’s unusual for his memorable writing style, the depth of his reading and his willingness to rethink constitutional principles from the ground up. Like Justice Scalia, he sometimes reaches results that favor liberals when he thinks the history or text of the Constitution or the law require it, especially in areas like criminal law or the rights of religious minorities, but unlike Scalia he’s less willing to defer to regulations and might be more willing to second-guess Trump’s regulatory decision.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T20:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T15:44:31.540+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
