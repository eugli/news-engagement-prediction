He was also booked on 3 felony counts for pointing the gun at 3 people. And he was booked on felony possession of a firearm without a permit. \nAs we reported, our sources say Sean was kicked and stomped on repeatedly by members of Migos. It's unclear what started Tuesday's fight at the Sands Expo & Convention Center. \nSean has not filed a police report against Migos and that clearly won't happen, because he said on social media Wednesday no one jumped him .
