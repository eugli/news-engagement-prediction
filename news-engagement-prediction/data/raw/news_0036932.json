More than 80 percent of those machines are lack \"voter-verifiable paper audit trails.\"\n  Though the voting machine network is not connected to the internet, the Stein team said that doesn't protect them from malware.\n\"Pennsylvania voters have the right to vote, to have their votes counted, and seek recounts of their votes. All of these rights are impossibly burdened in Pennsylvania, and subjected to arbitrary and unreasonable procedural rules that makes these rights a nullity,\" they wrote.\nPaperless voting is not unique to Pennsylvania. Voters in more than a dozen states cast ballots without a paper trail, though the Stein team points out that 70 percent of voters nationwide have their votes recorded on some form of paper.\nThe complaint alleges that Pennsylvania officials are \"maintaining and implementing a system of vote recount procedures that are fundamentally arbitrary, unreasonable, and unfair and that deny, severely burden, and nullify the right to a recount of the vote, and that violates Due Process and Equal Protection under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\"\nStein previously raised over $7 million to fund recount efforts in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin that resulted in only one successful electoral review in Wisconsin. It added 162 votes to Donald Trump 's tally.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner New EPA chief Pruitt says he will focus on restoring trust with states Agency says cooperation between states and government is critical, after Scott Pruitt sworn in.\nBy John Siciliano â€¢ 02/17/17 6:06 PM Read the amended complaint below:\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T01:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T02:25:04.660+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
