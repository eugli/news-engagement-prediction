Slot to Tennessee Links (Photo: Randy Sartin, USA TODAY Sports) In a year that featured perhaps the best collection of talent the state of Tennessee has produced, Tennessee didn’t rely heavily on in-state prospects in assembling its 2017 recruiting class. After announcing the additions of 22 new signees on National Signing Day, the Vols now have added seven in-state players in their 2017 class, along with an eighth — three-star wide receiver Princeton Fant of La Vergne, Tenn. — who wasn’t announced as a signee Wednesday but still is planning to enroll at Tennessee this year. While the Vols landed just four of the state’s top 16 prospects in the industry-generated 247Sports Composite, coach Butch Jones downplayed Tennessee’s relatively small group of in-state signees by noting that “each year is a little bit different.” He also pointed out that the Vols still were able to sign a few in-state stars, including five-star offensive lineman Trey Smith , top-100 running back Ty Chandler and top-100 safety Maleik Gray .

Tennessee’s in-state signing class is a noticeably larger group than the Vols signed last year, when the Vols landed just three players from the state of Tennessee in a class that featured 23 total signees. But their in-state targets who signed with other schools included five-star wide receiver Tee Higgins of nearby Oak Ridge, Tenn., Top247 wide receiver Amari Rodgers of Knoxville, top-100 linebacker Jacob Phillips of Nashville, Tenn., and five-star safety JaCoby Stevens of Murfreesboro, Tenn. , and Top247 offensive tackle Obinna Eze of Nashville. Jones stressed that addressing positional needs played a big role in determining how Tennessee filled out its 2017 class, adding that the Vols “probably had to turn away more talented players” than they had in any previous year since he arrived at Tennessee. “Again, it’s what you need, too, because you’re only going to take ‘X’ amount of players at this position,” he said. “We knew we were going to take three linebackers. That’s the number that we had said, is we were going to take three linebackers. We knew we had to take three running backs, if we could find the right three to take. We knew we needed to take a number of wide receivers. We knew we had to take two tight ends. “And then same thing: It was paramount for us to get three corners and two safeties, and we were able to do that with Maleik and Theo ( Jackson ). “We had to turn away very, very talented football players, unfortunately, because of our numbers and what we needed with this current football team. And we probably had to turn away more talented players than we’ve had since we’ve been here.” BUY ONE MONTH, GET TWO MONTHS FREE to get VIP access to GoVols247.
