Here's what happened when they accepted our 7-day challenge to try a new move every night.\nMy husband and I have always had a pretty good sex life. But to be honest, we have our few tried-and-true positions that we use almost all the time. After being together for 11 years, we know what works for us, and on most nights it's just easier to go with what you know. But since we both agreed we were in a routine, we felt ready to switch things up with a new sex position every night for a week. That's more times than we usually have sex (2 to 3 times a week is normal for us), but we were ready to get creative and flexible (literally—just keep reading).\n(Lose up to 25 pounds in 2 months—and look more radiant than ever—with Prevention 's new Younger In 8 Weeks plan! )\n*Names have been changed\nSubscribe X Close State AL AK AS AZ AR AA AE AP CA CO CT DE DC FL GA GU HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND MP OH OK OR PW PA RI SC SD TN TX VI UT VT VA WA WV WI WY Your Privacy Rights Canadian Customers\nSubscribe X Close State AL AK AS AZ AR AA AE AP CA CO CT DE DC FL GA GU HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND MP OH OK OR PW PA RI SC SD TN TX VI UT VT VA WA WV WI WY Your Privacy Rights Canadian Customers\nDay 1: Butter churner 1/7 Photograph courtesy of The Editors of Women's Health Day 1: Butter churner Jack started to laugh when I revealed that I knew about this position because I had seen it in a porn. I lay down on my back with my legs in the air, and he literally squatted over me, dipping his penis in and out my vagina, like, yup, an old fashioned butter churn. Jack was a little nervous about hurting my neck, but when I reassured him I was OK, we got into it. I think just doing something so different from our usual missionary-cowgirl-doggie style trifecta was a thrill for both of us. (Feeling adventurous?

Hubs grabbed my legs and lifted them up and had nice, easy access to enter me (makes things easier for yourself with this organic lube ). Honestly it was a little awkward to stay in this position for too long but it was fun while it lasted.\nMORE: 10 Little Things Connected Couples Do\nDay 3: Leap frog 3/7 Photograph courtesy of The Editors of Women's Health Day 3: Leap frog Of course doggie style is one of our faves, but this variation had me with my arms, head, and chest down on the pillow. It was nice in that I felt like I was taking a little break—my guy was definitely doing all the work here (and no, I didn't fall asleep, though I probably could have!). We both liked this one because it's not too complicated and it's just different enough from what we usually do to add a little spice .\nPrevention Premium: The Cure For Your Sexless Marriage\nDay 4: Best seat in the house 4/7 Photograph courtesy of The Editors of Women's Health Day 4: Best seat in the house This is a position we used to do a lot when we first started dating, so for us it was kind of nostalgic—and hot. With Jack sitting in a chair, I simply backed up onto him, controlling the movement as I slid up and down.\nDay 5: Cowboy 5/7 Photograph courtesy of The Editors of Women's Health Day 5: Cowboy We're a pretty open-minded couple, so we were game for a little gender role reversal this night. While I lay face-up on the bed with my legs together, Jack straddled me and tried to push himself into the opening between my legs. At first it felt a little silly to see him in what I felt was a really feminine position, but the sensations were so intense—for both of us—that we both finished quickly in this position. ( This remote-controlled couples massager is like nothing you've experienced before. Are you game?)\nDay 6: Seashell 6/7 Photograph courtesy of The Editors of Women's Health Day 6: Seashell There aren't many sex positions that have left me feeling as exposed as this one—but in a good way. As I lay back on the bed, my ankles crossed behind my head—did I mention how handy yoga comes in?—I was totally open for Jack. He loved the view and I was really turned on by the feeling of being so open for him. (Check out these 9 awkward, hysterical, and horrifying stories from sex ed class .)\nDay 7: Face off 7/7 Photograph courtesy of The Editors of Women's Health Day 7: Face off This night, we sat facing each other during sex and it was an extremely intimate encounter. Jack sat cross-legged while I got on top of him. There was definitely some gazing-into-your-soul eye contact going on, which I'll admit is probably a bit much for our usual 11 PM quickie—but it was pretty awesome to feel so connected during sex.\nThe verdict: Overall it was fun to try new positions—and just to have sex a lot more than usual. We'll probably take a few of these and incorporate them into our regular sex life. But really, it was just the idea of switching things up a little that helped to make sex feel new again. So I'd say mission accomplished!\nAdvertisement", "external_links": ["http://images.rodale.com/acc/pvn/2028039_pvn_flyout/2028039_pvn_flyout_516x360_bg.png);", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fsex%2Fnew-sex-position-with-my-husband-every-day-for-a-week%2Fslide%2F2&media=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fsites%2Fprevention.com%2Ffiles%2Fsex-postions-wheelbarrow.gif&description=Day%202%3A%20Standing%20wheelbarrow%20%20http://www.prevention.com/sex/new-sex-position-with-my-husband-every-day-for-a-week/slide/2", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fsex%2Fnew-sex-position-with-my-husband-every-day-for-a-week%2Fslide%2F5&media=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fsites%2Fprevention.com%2Ffiles%2Fnew-sex-postions-cowboy_0.gif&description=Day%205%3A%20Cowboy%20http://www.prevention.com/sex/new-sex-position-with-my-husband-every-day-for-a-week/slide/5", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fsex%2Fnew-sex-position-with-my-husband-every-day-for-a-week%3Futm_source%3Dplus.google.com%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsharebutton", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fsex%2Fnew-sex-position-with-my-husband-every-day-for-a-week%2Fslide%2F3&media=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fsites%2Fprevention.com%2Ffiles%2Fnew-sex-postions-husband-leap-frog.gif&description=Day%203%3A%20Leap%20frog%20http://www.prevention.com/sex/new-sex-position-with-my-husband-every-day-for-a-week/slide/3", "http://images.rodale.com/acc/pvn/2028039_pvn_flyout/2028039_submit.png)", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fsex%2Fnew-sex-position-with-my-husband-every-day-for-a-week%2Fslide%2F6&media=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fsites%2Fprevention.com%2Ffiles%2Fnew-sex-postions-seashell.gif&description=Day%206%3A%20Seashell%20http://www.prevention.com/sex/new-sex-position-with-my-husband-every-day-for-a-week/slide/6", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?s=100&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fsex%2Fnew-sex-position-with-my-husband-every-day-for-a-week%3Futm_source%3Dfacebook.com%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsharebutton&p", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fsex%2Fnew-sex-position-with-my-husband-every-day-for-a-week%2Fslide%2F4&media=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fsites%2Fprevention.com%2Ffiles%2Fnew-sex-postions-husband-best-seat-in-house_0.gif&description=Day%204%3A%20Best%20seat%20in%20the%20house%20http://www.prevention.com/sex/new-sex-position-with-my-husband-every-day-for-a-week/slide/4", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fsex%2Fnew-sex-position-with-my-husband-every-day-for-a-week%2Fslide%2F7&media=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fsites%2Fprevention.com%2Ffiles%2Fnew-sex-postions-husband-face-off.gif&description=Day%207%3A%20Face%20off%20http://www.prevention.com/sex/new-sex-position-with-my-husband-every-day-for-a-week/slide/7", "http://www.rodaleinc.com/your-privacy-rights", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I%20Tried%20A%20New%20Sex%20Position%20With%20My%20Husband%20Every%20Day%20For%20A%20Week%2C%20And%20Here%27s%20How%20It%20Went&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fsex%2Fnew-sex-position-with-my-husband-every-day-for-a-week%3Futm_source%3Dt.co%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsharebutton&via=preventionmag", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fsex%2Fnew-sex-position-with-my-husband-every-day-for-a-week%2Fslide%2F1&media=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fsites%2Fprevention.com%2Ffiles%2Fnew-sex-postions-husband-butter-churner.gif&description=Day%201%3A%20Butter%20churner%20%20http://www.prevention.com/sex/new-sex-position-with-my-husband-every-day-for-a-week/slide/1"], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:59:12.823+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
