Isn't the whole point of the #FiftyShades bonkbuster to chat about bonin' and watch two attractive actors pretend to be bonin'? There's a full elevator fingering scene, for goodness sake — c'mon Universal, give us what our sexually frustrated selves really want!

Because [this film is] supposed to be more about the ‘romance.’ Maybe I went too far... I don’t know—I sent out a picture of a sex toy and I was like, ‘Dear Christian, thank you so much for that lovely bracelet under the Christmas tree. Perhaps it wasn’t meant for me. Oh well, so pretty.’ And all the fans would write back, ‘No, that wasn’t for you, Mama Grey, oh no.’ That was a lot of fun but it was shut down.\" \nQuite frankly, if Marcia wants to get her chat on about nipple-clamps and sex toys during a promotional interview for the movie, we're all for it. After all, that titillating conversation would probably be more entertaining than the entirety of the Fifty Shades romance plot. \nDo you think Marcia Gay Harden should be allowed to talk sex when it comes to Fifty Shades Darker ?
