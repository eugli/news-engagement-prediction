Cottrell, 56, of Lake Village, was charged with neglect of a dependent, battery on a person less than 14, and battery on a disabled person. (St. John Police Department) (Jerry Davich) \n\"She told me she didn't mean to hurt the child, but come on,\" Flores said. \"She did it repeatedly.\" \nCottrell, who began caring for the boy in November, was employed by Anchor Home Health Care in Valparaiso. The company did not respond to my call or email regarding how long Cottrell had worked there or how the agency vets its home health care nurses. \nThe boy's mother, who asked not to be identified, declined comment. \nIf anything comes out of this tragic story, it should be a warning to parents in similar situations with their children, or to elderly or disabled clients who rely on home health care professionals to ask a few additional questions of the hiring agency. \nIf it wasn't for the mother's curiosity about her nanny-cam recordings, nothing may have ever been known about the alleged abuse. One night earlier this month, she couldn't sleep, so she casually checked the recordings of the basement area where her son is cared for and spends most of his time, documents said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T07:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:53:16.846+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
