Soon she was sobbing. \nIt was January 12, five years ago, when Matt's father, Lionel Ogilvy, and his younger brother, Sam, went to Fitzroy Beach in Taranaki for a swim after work. \nThere were no lifeguards on duty. \nREAD MORE: Family mourns father who drowned \n\"Sam was struggling, caught in a rip, and then dad went in and helped him,\" Matt recalls. \"He basically held [Sam] afloat until help came, causing him to get caught in the rip and drown.\" \nThat night, Matt and his mum drove to Taranaki to be with his brother and two other siblings. \n\"[Sam] wore the worst of it. I don't think he's over it. I don't think he ever will be. I know he blames himself a lot.\" \nYet the death of his dad has turned into an opportunity for Matt, 17, who is the recipient of a full scholarship from First Foundation. \nThe scholarship is awarded to Year 13 students who have come from low socio-economic homes. Matt said it's also for teenagers who have had to deal with tragedy, or unfortunate circumstances in their life leading up to high school. Ad Feedback \nIt will pay Matt's tertiary fees for four years. \nAfter his dad's death, instead of thinking, \"screw everything, there's no point\", it made the deputy head boy of Fairfield College want to work harder at school. \nTo be eligible for the scholarship, students have to obtain a merit endorsement for NCEA level 1, 2 and 3 - which, so far, he has achieved. He just needs to get through his last year of high school. \n\"It means I have the chance to study what I want without worrying so much about the financial state, which takes a lot of stress off,\" he said. \n\"The really awesome thing about the scholarship is you can choose what you want.\" \nThe foundation also pairs him up with a sponsor, Prolife Foods, that will provide him paid work experience this year. He also gets a mentor tailored to fit his tertiary path. \nMatt, who has an older brother and sister as well as a younger brother and sister, said his dad understood the importance of education and would be proud. \nHis older sister recently graduated university with first class honours and now lives in Cambridge, England. \n\"He just wanted the best for us. He was never like, 'stay up and do your homework' kind of thing, but more, 'if you want to get somewhere in life you have to work hard and earn it'.\" \nMatt is looking to study clinical psychology at Otago University. \n\"I find mental illnesses and the behaviour of others very interesting. It is my passion to help people understand what they're going through themselves. \n\"[Dad] would be really proud because I know that he wanted the best for us as his kids - he'd be over the moon.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:04:02.952+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
