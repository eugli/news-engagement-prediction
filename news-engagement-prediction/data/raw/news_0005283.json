Let’s get it on! Lady Gaga Says Her Super Bowl Halftime Show Will be About ‘Inclusion’ and ‘Equality’ https://t.co/91ORnQ4jNI (VIDEO) pic.twitter.com/wSaIj4g4k5 \nFrom Mediaite : \nThis morning at a press conference , she was asked, “I know you spoke about kind of taking this moment to unify America a little bit. Are you going to do that at all? Are you going to make any kind of statements during the performance?” She answered, “Well, I don’t know if I will succeed in unifying America. You’ll have to ask America when it’s over. But the only statements that I’ll be making during the halftime show are the ones that I’ve been consistently making throughout my career.” \nAs far as what those statements are, she said, “I believe in a passion for inclusion. I believe in the spirit of equality, and the spirit of this country as one of love and compassion and kindness. So my performance will have both those philosophies.” \nWheee! This is exactly what football fans want in a Super Bowl! Yes, a musical sermon about inclusion and equality delivered by Lady Gaga is sure to resonate with the NFL audience! https://t.co/tNo4jejEqz \n— Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) February 3, 2017 Because Super Bowl parties aren’t complete without some entitled rich NYC kid who’s now a frillionare entertainer lecturing America. https://t.co/uLy5Vjfjgm \n— Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) February 3, 2017 So, halftime at the super bowl is gonna be lame.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T05:03:05.603+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
