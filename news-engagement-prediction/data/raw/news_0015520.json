It won’t arrive in theaters until the fall, but fans clamoring for more action set in its soggy, neon-drenched future Los Angeles now have a new way to satiate their fix via a fan film from some intrepid Croatian filmmakers.

As the promo above thrillingly bears out, their ability to mimic the look and feel of Scott’s source material is astounding, especially given that only five people have been involved in its production.\n\n\nSushi Bar \nYo, here's a cool shot of the Sushi Bar – in motion!\nPosted by Slice of Life on Sunday, December 4, 2016\nThe director (who hails from an advertising background) told The Verge that the story will be a somewhat familiar noir-ish tale about a “low-life drug dealer who tries to turn his life around, but finds himself at the mercy of fate when he encounters a cop with an agenda of his own.” And the above trailer has been released in order to initiate a Kickstarter campaign to raise the remaining $30,000 the team says is needed to complete the 20-25-minute short, which they’ve crafted using some old-school movie techniques (rear projection; matte paintings; miniatures), and which they eventually hope to screen at film festivals.\nEven the Noodle bar sign was done in miniature, with EL-wire! #bladerunner #sliceoflifefilm #future #neon #makingminiatures #scalemodel pic.twitter.com/LeHLWw2P5W \n— Slice Of Life (@Slice_Of_Life01) December 16, 2016 \n\n\nTo read more about it, head over to The Verge  — as well as to the movie’s official Facebook and Twitter pages, which showcase tons of behind-the-scenes material about how the filmmakers achieved such Blade Runner fidelity.\nMeanwhile, Villeneuve’s Blade Runner 2049  — starring Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford — debuts in theaters on Oct. 6.\nWatch the ‘Blade Runner 2049’ trailer: \n\nRead More: \nWe Saw 40 Minutes of ‘Logan,’ and It’s Going to Change Superhero Movies \nDirector Scott Derrickson on ‘Doctor Strange’ Sequel and His Future in the Marvel Cinematic Multiverse", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T00:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T04:34:56.543+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
