And he even said that in this situation he has to “side with the media” in the belief that every single credentialed reporter should have access. \nKimberly Guilfoyle pointed out this happened to Fox News during the Obama administration. \nBolling concluded that Sean Spicer doesn’t have to call on every single reporter there, but at the very least all of them should be allowed in. \nGreg Gutfeld disagreed and said he didn’t quite understand the big deal here. \nWatch above, via Fox News. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T07:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T02:25:35.235+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
