international or domestic - in more than a year. \nAllrounders Dasun Shanaka, Milinda Siriwardana and batsmen Dilshan Munaweera, Chamara Kapugedara have also been included in the national side after being dropped against South Africa. \nUpul Tharanga, who is currently leading Sri Lanka in the ongoing ODIs against South Africa , will lead the team in absence of regular captain Angelo Mathews, who is unavailable for selection due to an injury. \nMeanwhile, Dinesh Chandimal, who led Sri Lanka to a 2-1 win in the three-match T20 series against South Africa, has been left out of the squad against the Steve Smith-led side. \nChandimal’s omission seems to have come in the wake of his recent poor performances across formats against South Africa. \nAlthough Sri Lanka won the T20I series under Chandimal’s leadership, he only contributed scores of 6 not out, 22 and 5, and made significant errors as wicketkeeper during the tour. \nSquad: Upul Tharanga (captain), Niroshan Dickwella, Asela Gunaratna, Dilshan Munaweera, Kusal Mendis, Milinda Siriwardana, Sachith Pathirana, Chamara Kapugedara, Seekkuge Prasanna, Nuwan Kulasekara, Isuru Udana, Dasun Shanaka, Lakshan Sandakan, Lasith Malinga, Vikum Sanjaya. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T23:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:53:46.459+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
