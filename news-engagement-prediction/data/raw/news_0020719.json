If you pre-order a unit from the UK website, the device will be shipped to you within 11 days, while US residents can expect to get their unit within 8 days. However, it should be noted that the 128GB version of the OnePlus 3T is only available in one color, which is the Gunmetal color, and not in Soft Gold. Before this, OnePlus had a hard time keeping up with the demand for the device and consumers had to wait for awhile after ordering a unit. However, it is likely that consumers can expect to receive their device within days once the pre-ordering period is over, compared to the weeks consumers used to have to wait. \nEarlier this week, OnePlus announced the availability of the OnePlus 3T in Soft Gold in many regions around the world, though it is only the 64GB storage variant which is available for purchase at the moment. If you purchase it from the OnePlus UK or US store, you can expect to receive the device within 4 days. The OnePlus 3T was initially launched in November of 2016, and served as a followup to the OnePlus 3. Both devices sport identical dimensions, but the OnePlus 3T packs slightly better specs over its predecessor, which includes an upgraded processor and a battery with a larger capacity. The front facing camera was also upgraded and a new color option was introduced, which is the Gunmetal color. \nWhile the Gunmetal OnePlus 3T may have a larger storage capacity, other internals remain identical to other OnePlus 3T units. This includes a 5.5-inch display with a fullHD resolution, and 6GB of RAM. The device is powered by a Snapdragon 821 processor and comes with a 3,400mAh non-removable battery which can be charged via a USB Type-C port, with support for Dash Charge. For optics, it packs a 16-megapixel camera on the rear, and the front side of the device also comes with a 16-megapixel shooter. Software wise, it comes with Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box along with OxygenOS. A fingerprint scanner has also been embedded into the capacitive home button of the smartphone, and it has proved to be really quick at unlocking the device.
