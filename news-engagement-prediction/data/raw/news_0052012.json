Instead, he shuttled from one park to another located in the neighbourhood. \nRaja was arrested by Delhi Police on Tuesday. “He was sleeping in a park near his house when we traced him,” said a senior investigator. But, police said, his absence from his home over two days did not surprise his mother. “Raja’s mother says he would stay away from home for days on end,” said the officer. \nA native of Dholpur in Rajasthan, where he studied till class five, Raja would earn his living by doing odd jobs at pubs and restaurants in Hauz Khas Village . “He was not employed in any restaurant. He would earn his living by washing dishes or doing cleaning at night at a pub or restaurant that may have been short of staff,” said RP Upadhyay, Joint CP (South-Eastern Range).

He knew the Deer Park area well and that helped him find a spot where he allegedly committed the crime with no one around to come to the help of the victim. \nIn the early hours of Sunday, when the victim and her cousin stepped out of a restaurant to return home, Raja and his juvenile friend met the sisters and offered to drop them home in a car they said was parked elsewhere. \nWhile the older woman was dropped home in an autorickshaw, the victim was tricked by Raja into accompanying him into the Deer Park. He told her that his car was parked on the other end of the park for which they would have to scale the walls of the park that was locked at night. \nWhen the victim objected to entering the park, Raja convinced her saying the park provided a shortcut to the location where the car was parked and that the route would also allow them to see a dry lake on the way.

But when they entered deep into the park, the accused tried to take advantage of her,” said an investigator. \nWhen Raja touched the woman inappropriately, the woman fought back, even hitting him with a stone and leaving him bleeding. But the accused allegedly hit her back with the same stone, repeatedly slapped before raping her twice. \nHe then escaped from the park by scaling the same wall. But he neither went home nor visited a doctor to get his injured head treated. He was found in the same clothes in which he had committed the crime. \nThe victim’s iPhone that he allegedly snatched after the rape has been recovered from him. Police have also found him in possession of Rs 450 of the Rs 600 he took from her wallet before fleeing. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:12:24.866+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
