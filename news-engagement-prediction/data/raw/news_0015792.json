Iain McGregor \nTim Johnston appeals for a wicket while playing for New Zealand under-19 against their England counterparts in 2010. \nSecond placed Canterbury meet Wellington in their final round clash at Hagley Oval on Wednesday with the victor guaranteeing themselves first place after round play. \nREAD MORE: *Canterbury qualify for Ford Trophy finals after doing double over Auckland \nThe 26-year-old has featured prominently in all three forms for the first time this summer after previously being viewed as a four day specialist. \nIn previous seasons, Todd Astle was Canterbury's lone frontline spinner, which made it difficult for Johnston to get a run, especially on green seamers around the country. \nCanterbury have opted to play two spinners this summer and have used a third option, offspinner Cole McConchie, in many of their matches. \nJohnston received interest from other associations in the past, but was determined to fight for his place in the side and knew his chance would come. \nHis loyalty and hard toil behind the scenes has finally been rewarded and he's thriving. Ad Feedback \n\"Don't get me wrong, it has been frustrating [in the past],\" he said. \n\"Playing for Canterbury has always been what I've wanted to do. Being Canterbury born-and-bred, that's what I've always wanted. It's great to be able to help the team out now and put some results together.\" \nJohnston has worked closely with former Black Caps' offspinner Paul Wiseman in recent years and training alongside Astle on a daily basis has been instrumental for his development. \n\"It's like doing an apprenticeship and really learning your craft. Toddy [Astle] is a great fella and he's been great to me over the years. I believe he's a world class spinner.\" \nCanterbury might have wondered where the wickets were going to come from in the Ford Trophy without injured quicks Ed Nuttall and Kyle Jamieson, who combined for 28 wickets in last season's competition. \nJohnston, Logan van Beek and Will Williams have stepped up in their absence and impressed for a Canterbury side, who are peaking at the right time having won three successive matches. \nCanterbury coach Brendon Donkers praised Johnston's performances and said he had been crucial to their success. \n\"For me, he's been our most consistent and attacking bowler. He's getting wickets early, which has been a big boost for his confidence and for the team. \n\"He's been putting batsmen under a lot of pressure, not only with his accuracy, but with his ability to turn the ball. \nJohnston has spent plenty of time working on variations in his pace and trying to attack batsmen, rather than simply contain them. \nWith an economy rate of just 4.38 per over he's the sixth most economical bowler in the competition, which is tying down an end and causing batsmen to take risks. \n\"That's my main focus to keep that RPO down. If I can go below fives or even below sixes, I'm generally doing my job for the team. Then the wickets come from there. I've stopped putting the focus on taking wickets.\" \nCanterbury were desperate to beat Wellington and secure top spot for the finals. They are guaranteed a top four berth, but could slip down the table with a loss and bonus point wins by Northern Districts or Auckland. \nJohnston and his team-mates are gunning for their first white ball trophy since 2005-06, which had given them an extra spring in their step. \n\"It's something we want to rectify. \n\"There is a lot of fire in the belly. It's something we really want to knock off. We just need to keep doing what we're doing.\" \nAT A GLANCE: \nRound 8 Ford Trophy: \nWednesday 11am start; Hagley Oval \nCanterbury: Andrew Ellis (c), Todd Astle, Chad Bowes, Cam Fletcher, Peter Fulton, Matt Henry, Tim Johnston, Tom Latham, Cole McConchie, Henry Nicholls, Henry Shipley, Logan van Beek. \nWellington: Hamish Marshall (c), Brent Arnel, Hamish Bennett, Tom Blundell, Scott Borthwick, Iain McPeake, Ollie Newton, Michael Papps, Jeetan Patel, Michael Pollard, Luke Ronchi, Matt Taylor, Luke Woodcock. \nPoints: Wellington 21, Canterbury 19, ND 15, Auckland 15, CD 11, Otago 10. \nLeading wicket-takers: 15: Scott Kuggeleijn (ND), 11: Tim Johnston (Canty),10: Anurag Verma (Wel), 9: Hamish Bennett (Wel), Anaru Kitchen (Ota), Donovan Grobbelaar (Akl), Christi Viljoen (Ota), Jono Boult (ND). - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T09:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T08:05:47.275+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
