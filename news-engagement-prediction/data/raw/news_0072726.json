Bad jokes aplenty. Can be gently prodded on Twitter at @kitsb1 \nNow, while #JamesGunn may have become famous for directing the #GuardiansOfTheGalaxy movies, dedicated fans of movie geekery have been following his development as a writer and director for quite some time. Gunn, after all, is also the mildly unhinged mind behind such nerdtastic films as #Super , #Slither and, as a writer, the #DawnOfTheDead remake. ' Guardians Of the Galaxy Vol. 2': News, Trailer, Release Date, Plot, Characters & All You Need To Know \nWhich perhaps explains why, a few years ago, long before the upcoming #GuardiansOfTheGalaxyVol2 was even a glint in his eye, Gunn was offered the chance to direct a #Hitman movie. After all, #Hitman is a pretty nerdy sort of movie, and Gunn was (and is) both a pretty fundamentally nerdy — and distinctly talented — director. It was, you would imagine, a match made in heaven. Except, of course, for the fact that Gunn turned the job down. As it turns out, though: James Gunn Had A Very Good Reason For Turning Down The 'Hitman' Movie 'Guardians of the Galaxy' [Credit: Marvel Studios] \nSpecifically, it turns out that the producers of the project didn't want to make it R rated, and Gunn felt that wasn't something he was willing to pursue: I tried to make a Hitman movie a few years ago. But the producers at the time didnt want to make it R rated, so they passed. https://t.co/BAToI5lfaQ — James Gunn (@JamesGunn) February 21, 2017 \nWhich is a) a perfectly reasonable response from Gunn, seeing as it would be a massive waste of everyone's time for him to make a movie he thought was misconceived, and b) kind of funny, considering the fact that the #Hitman franchise went R rated in 2015 with #HitmanAgent47 . \nThe good news here, though, is that, according to Gunn, it's really just as well he didn't take the gig: In all fairness, if I had done Hitman I probably would have been out of the running for the 1st #GotG . So it all turned out okay in the end. https://t.co/gmSKz4FQQ7 — James Gunn (@JamesGunn) February 21, 2017 \nAfter all, while it would have been neat to see a Gunn-directed Hitman movie, it's unlikely that it would have been worth exchanging Guardians of the Galaxy for it. \nSo, I guess we're calling this one a win, then? \nWhat do you think, though? Would you have preferred to have seen a Gunn-directed Hitman movie or Guardians of the Galaxy ? Let us know below!
