By Matt Fuller \nNATIONAL HARBOR, Md. ― Former U.K. Independence Party leader Nigel Farage came to the annual Conservative Political Action Conference to congratulate himself on supporting U.S. President Donald Trump , bash the media and call for a “great global revolution.” \nFarage drew a direct line between the June 2016 “Brexit” vote, in which British citizens opted to exit the European Union, and Trump’s surprising U.S. presidential victory in November. \nCalling on more nations to vote for what he views as their nationalist interests, Farage noted, “We’ve got some very exciting elections coming up in the Netherlands, in France, in Germany, possibly even in Italy. They’re rejecting the idea of being governed by a bunch of unelected old men in Brussels.” \nFarage helped lead the political movement behind Brexit, a position of isolationism that has caused debated economic effects in Britain and across Europe. The British pound immediately fell when British voters sided with Farage’s “leave” campaign in June. The currency recently dropped to a three-year low compared to the Euro and a three-decade low against the dollar. \nStill, Brexit’s supporters have been emboldened recently, in part by Trump’s “ America First ” rhetoric and similar nationalist movements in Europe that advocate for tighter borders and policies that critics denounce as nativist and xenophobic .
