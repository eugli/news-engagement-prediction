Security officials have denied any such stoppage is planned.\nIn Espirito Santo, soldiers patrolled abandoned streets in downtown Vitoria, stopping and frisking the occasional pedestrian against shuttered storefronts.\nState officials said they needed hundreds more federal troops and members of an elite federal police force to help establish order and make up for the absence of some 1,800 state police who normally patrol Vitoria's metropolitan area.\n\"The Army's involvement in Espirito Santo is temporary. It is here to make government negotiations possible and bring peace to the population. We are not going to replace the police,\" General Eduardo Villas Boas said on Twitter.\n\"HOSTAGES IN OUR HOMES\"\nThe state government has not released an official number for killings since police started striking on Saturday, but a spokeswoman for the union representing police told Reuters early on Thursday it had registered 101 homicides.\nThat would be more than six times the state's average homicide rate during the same period last year. The Globo TV network, citing security officials, reported that 200 cars were stolen in Vitoria on a single day, 10 times the daily average for the whole state.\nThe state's retail association said businesses have lost 90 million reais ($28.87 million) since police walked off the job.\nWhere stores did open their doors, they were swarmed by shoppers stocking up as if preparing for a natural disaster.\n\"Good thing the supermarket opened because I have two young children at home and the food is running out,\" said salesman Vitor Paulo, weighed down with shopping bags. \"It's like we're hostages in our own homes. We're scared to go out.\"\nRepresentatives of the striking police, including some of the officers' wives, met with state officials on Wednesday to demand that salaries be doubled for every category of officer.\nThe union said its members have not received a raise in four years. Monthly pay for an officer starts at 2,643 reais ($848), according to Corporal Thiago Bicalho, a spokesman for striking police.\n\"We are going to analyze the offer and see what we can do in reality to advance this situation,\" said Julio Pompeu, director of the state's human rights secretariat, who is helping the government negotiate with police.\nThe two sides are scheduled to meet again on Thursday.\n(Reporting by Paulo Whitaker and Pablo Garcia; Additional reporting by Rodrigo Viga Gaier in Rio de Janeiro Writing and additional reporting by Brad Brooks and Brad Haynes; Editing by Leslie Adler and James Dalgleish)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T05:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:48:54.599+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
