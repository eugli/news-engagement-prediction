Perhaps it's because the thought of him teaming up with former Everton and Wigan Athletic manager Roberto Martinez to try and lead one of the most talented groups of players in the world to international glory is too bewildering to believe. \nEither way, Henry is no doubt an ex-player with an immense pedigree that the likes of Eden Hazard, Kevin de Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku can all benefit from. \nAnd it's Lukaku who the Arsenal legend has been discussing recently, during a recent interview with the Belgian press. \nDespite underwhelming under Marc Wilmots at last year's European Championships and the 2014 World Cup, Belgium are still in possession of one of the most talented squads in world football. As well as the aforementioned Premier League trio, the Red Devils also have the likes of Dries Mertens, Mousa Dembele, Yannick Carrasco, Divock Origi, Youri Tielemans and Thibaut Courtois at their disposal. \nYet the Everton striker is the one who Henry seemed most interested in discussing, sharing with the press his unusual nickname for the 23-year-old. \n\"All the Red Devils want to learn. I call Romelu the lawyer. He discusses everything, even his socks. \n\"It's important that people know that because sometimes they think the younger generation doesn't care enough. \n\"What does he need to improve? Everything should be even better. But he's young. He'll keep getting better.\" Thierry Henry: \"I call Lukaku 'the lawyer'. Because he likes to debate everything. That's him. He wants to know everything.\" (Sporza) #efc pic.twitter.com/n9QUIGEOOj - Kristof Terreur :newspaper: (@HLNinEngeland) February 6, 2017 \nAre Henry and Martinez the unlikely duo who can inspire Belgium to triumph at next year's World Cup or will the Red Devils flatter to deceive once again?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T15:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T12:19:39.401+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
