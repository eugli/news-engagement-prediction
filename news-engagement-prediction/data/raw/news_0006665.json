Those words are derived from the media. Your network was one of the ones that just hours ago said [Homeland Security Secretary] Kelly didn’t know what was going on. With all due respect, I think you have been part of the confusion.” \nNailed it. \nHere’s the video… WATCH: White House: Pres. Trump is using the word \"ban\" because the media is using the word \"ban. @kwelkernbc : \"Those are his words.\" pic.twitter.com/hu10yUB9Q5 \n— NBC Nightly News (@NBCNightlyNews) January 31, 2017 \nThe media knows this is not a “Muslim ban”. \nThey know it’s a temporary travel ban. \nThey are purposely misleading the public to think otherwise. \nIt’s simply embarrassing.
