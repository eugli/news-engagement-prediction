(Getty/AFP) \nA group of Americans living in Mexico are planning a protest Thursday to send a message to visiting Secretary of State Rex Tillerson . \nTheir gripe? \nPresident Trumpâ€™s \"inflammatory rhetoric.\" \nThat's according to a draft of a letter that several groups organizing the protest hope to deliver to Tillerson, who is in town along with Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly for talks with top Mexican officials. \nThe letter, which will be co-signed by the Mexican chapter of Democrats Abroad, as well as other groups, complains about Trump's \"hostile\" attitude toward Mexico, which it says is engendering \"nationalistic sentiments\" in Mexico. \nAmong Trump's hostile acts, the letter says, is Trump's vow to build a border wall and force Mexico to pay for it. \n\"The idea of building a wall ... frames Mexico and Mexicans as foreign invaders,\" the letter says. \nIt also criticizes Trump for pledging to renegotiate NAFTA, saying, \"the U.S. and Mexico are deeply connected economies and it is in the interest of the United States to strengthen the regional production network to boost manufacturing employment in the U.S. and ensure the long-run competitiveness of manufacturing in the region.\" \nThere are more than a million U.S. citizens living in Mexico, and many have been vocal since Trump's election. Last month, thousands turned out for a Women's March outside of the American Embassy that saw crowds chanting anti-Trump slogans.
