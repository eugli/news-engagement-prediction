The excitement is likely due, in part, to Queen B's already perfected displays of mommy-and-me beauty, which she and Blue Ivy have down to an adorable science—who knows what emulatable above-the-neck coordination two babies will bring? Mother/baby matching comes in many forms, presented in welcome abundance by our favorite celebrity moms. When it comes to Blue and Bey, the former's cloud of curls is best paired with her mother's wavy, golden chop. Kim Kardashian West and baby North are known for their generational mane styling —ironed lengths for Kim, on-trend, Mickey Mouse buns for North—with Saint's presence infusing the mix with a bit of boyish raven shine. Blake Lively's daughter, James, has clearly inherited her mother's trademark blonde, though the toddler's texture currently skews curly cute. And while Chrissy Teigen's daughter Luna is likely to grow into mom's down-to-there brunette locks (she makes up for it in headband prowess in the meantime), Angelina Jolie and daughter Shiloh enjoy contrasted coloring that proves passed-down beauty can also be an individual affair.
