Close VIDEO News break - February 16. Source: 7 News News break - February 16 \nThe camera was found inside an equipment shed at the Bendigo CFA brigade which was being used as an \"unofficial change room\". \n\"We have today stood aside a senior member pending a full investigation into the unauthorised use of a security camera in one of our stations,\" the CFA said in a statement on Thursday. \nIt's yet to confirm how long the camera was in place. A senior CFA member has been stood aside. \n\"CFA takes this issue seriously, we are committed to ensuring our workplaces are safe, secure and support the wellbeing of staff and volunteers at all times,\" the CFA said. \n\"CFA is constantly reviewing our workplaces to ensure they provide a safe environment for women at all times, where we need to make improvements we will take action immediately.\" \nThe footage from the camera is now secure and the matter has been referred to police for investigation. \nThe CFA says the incident may have affected a number of volunteers and it is in the process of contacting firefighters from the station. \nIt's not yet known if anyone at the station has viewed the footage. \nBendigo is an integrated station with both career and volunteer staff. \nVolunteer Fire Brigades Victoria chief executive Andrew Ford said he wanted to see solutions to ensure it didn't happen again. \n\"Whether this is an unintentional mistake or an intentional act, it's a problem and it needs to be fixed,\" Mr Ford told AAP. \n\"(I'm) very disappointed it has happened because it's put people in a situation that they don't deserve to be in.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T12:10:28.550+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
