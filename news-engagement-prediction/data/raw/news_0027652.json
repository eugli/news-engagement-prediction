If the shooter failed to realise this before firing the next round, it would result in a “chamber explosion”, he said.\n\nThe cause of the second flood , which happened on May 3, 2015, was caused by a blockage of the pipe connecting two sections of the drain which was chocked by debris, claimed SRA.\n\nNo damage to the armoury was caused by the second flood, Mr Kung said, because he had used plastic pellets to raise the boxes of ammunition off the floor.\n\nMr Wong said the S$455,678 in losses SRA claims it suffered include the cost of damaged ammunition, cost of disposal of damaged ammunition, losses of SRA’s members and cleaning and replacement of damaged items.\n\nOn its part, SSA will argue that SRA was “contributorily negligent”, and had refused to seal the windows to the armoury “in full knowledge that the armoury was located in the basement and prone to the ingress of water in the event of a flood”.\n\nSRA also argued that the “windows issue” was a matter of security.\n\nMr Wong said the sealing of the windows for security reasons had been raised by the police in 2014. SRA had sought SSA’s approval to seal the windows in 2015, but was “not allowed to”, Mr Wong said, explaining that the SSA had been “under instructions” by Sport Singapore not to carry out any construction works until after the 2015 SEA Games.\n\nSport Singapore is the national sports governing body. It had last February ordered the closure of the National Shooting Centre run by the SRA due to irregularities in gun licensing which were found during an audit of its armoury. Police seized more than 70 weapons from the armoury.\n\nThis sparked another legal tussle between SRA and Mr Vaz. \n\nThe trial involving damages from the flooding continues.\n\n- CNA/gs\nEmail More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T16:30:15.452+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
