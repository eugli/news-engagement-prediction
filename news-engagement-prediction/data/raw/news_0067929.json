Google has joined in on the celebration with a new animated doodle featured on its homepage. \nIn the Google Doodle, Earth and its moon discover their friendly space neighbors through a telescope. \nImage: GOOGLE \nThe solar system called TRAPPIST-1 consists of at least seven planets similar to the size of Earth. Three of them reside in the \"habitable zone\" — the area in orbit around the star where planets could conceivably host water on their surfaces given the right atmospheric conditions. \nThe question on everyone's mind is whether these planets can support life. Scientists have significant studying to do before they can say \"yes\" or \"no\" with any certainty, but the potential has us at the edge of our seats.
