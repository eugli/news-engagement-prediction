It landed in waters off North Korea`s east coast, according to local media reports. \nPyongyang test-fired Musudan missiles near the same place, where an airfield is located, in October last year. \nIt was North Korea`s first test-launch of a ballistic missile in 2017 and also the first since US President Donald Trump took office on January 20. \nSouth Korea`s military said Pyongyang`s launch of ballistic missile was a provocative act in violation of UN Security Council`s resolutions, which ban North Korea from testing any ballistic missile technology. \nThe launch, the military believed, was aimed at drawing attention by showing off its nuclear and missile capability and was also part of armed protest against the Trump administration`s hard-line stance toward North Korea. \nNorth Korea in October last year tested Musudan missiles twice that were fired from the same airbase. \nMeanwhile, a United States official told media that the test launch conducted by North Korea was probably not an intercontinental ballistic missile. \nThe official, speaking on condition of anonymity, provided no further details. A defense official said earlier that the U.S. military had detected the missile launch and was assessing it.
