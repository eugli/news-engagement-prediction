Meanwhile, Louise has continued to insist that their friendship won’t survive if Bex has contact with Shakil Kazemi, forcing loyal Bex to sacrifice her romance for her friend. \nBut when she develops a friendship with Travis, the boy Louise developed a crush on at her drama club, things turn sour again. (Picture: BBC) \nIt’s Shakil who spots Bex with Travis and, from a distance, it seems like they are pretty close. Shakil was on his way to speak with Bex after a pep talk from his older brother Kush. But he is disappointed to see Bex chatting happily with Travis and feels he has missed his chance. (Picture: BBC) \nAs gossip reaches Alexandra and Madison that Bex may have a new romance, they can’t resist sharing it with Louise in order to deliberately stir up a feud between the pair. (Picture: BBC) \nLouise takes the bait and is left furious, marching over to confront a shocked Bex over moving in on the boy she likes. (Picture: BBC) \nWill Bex admit that there is something going on with her and Travis or are they simply just friend? (Picture: BBC) \nAnd can Louise and Bex’s friendship survive this latest clash? \nOne to watch: Thursday 16th February on BBC One at 7:30pm.
