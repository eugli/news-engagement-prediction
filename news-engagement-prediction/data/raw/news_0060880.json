It can take the market cap much higher. \n\n\nEdited excerpts: \n\nWhen we last met, you were part of the minority and you said that a new high on the Nifty is coming very soon. We are almost there. \n\nThank you. Our markets have a long way to go. There is no doubt that the basic or structural reason for that is because the economy itself, which is very small today, will have to grow. We have no other way but to grow. \n\nSo where do we go from here because we are about a 100 points away from an all time high. What I want to understand from you is how does one understand and fathom the price action? It is not about smallcap and midcap stocks this week. We have seen a serious jump in market cap. How does the ordinary investor understand this trend? \n\nThis market cap and new highs in Nifty are going to be very tricky because the general market or the overall market is moving up. Some segments are having so many challenges that we cannot really bet on them, companies like Infosys , TCS , the largecap IT companies. It is very difficult to expect significant further upwards movement in the next one year or two . New ones are coming up like Reliance. A few months ago I talked about Reliance Industries as being at an inflection point. I feel that is happening and telecom can be really big. It can take the market cap much higher. Bharti could again move up further. There can be some new largecaps coming to new highs and contributing significantly to the Nifty in the coming days. \n\nNifty can go to 12000-13000 kind of levels in the next I would say two years. \n\nYou spoke about betting on largecaps, some new names as well. Tell us without getting too specific on stocks, which are the sectors that interest you? What kind of allocation would you look at in a portfolio right now? \n\nI am still sticking to some quality midcaps. On the budget day, I was talking about stocks which did not move in the last one year. That is where people should look. TCI was one stock I talked about and Hindustan Sanitaryware (HSIL). These are very high quality companies, not only are they high quality midcaps they are also industry leaders and have Rs 2000 crore, Rs 1500 crore kind of valuations. The economic environment is going to be favourable for them going forward. \n\nWith GST happening, demonetisation and related efforts are going to create a lot of structural changes in the economy -- from black to white, from unorganised to organised . As these kind of major changes happen in the economy and the country, some of the smart companies are going to benefit immensely. TCI and HSIL have gone up significantly after we discussed it on the budget day. But even at the current prices, I like such industry leaders in this country. \n\nOf course I am holding in PMS both the stocks TCI and HSIL. \n\nWhat are the underperformers? You have the realty index which is higher, DLF is up 32%, Godrej Properties is up 21% and of course the metals sector has been the darling of the market last year. The momentum on that sector has not abated any bit. You are looking at double digit gains for all the key players there as well. JSPL is up 62%, Bhushan Steel is up 42%, anything that you like in these two spaces? \n\nI really liked and once talked about stocks like Vedanta and Hindalco which came to ridiculously low levels that it felt these companies are going to close down. Today they have really gained strength and the industry environment also helped them. I am not excited about these stocks at these levels but they can also contribute going forward to the Nifty movement in the next 1-2 yearsâ€™ time. \n\nSome people expect whatever uptrend happened in the metal prices and all can just reverse. It may not happen like that. The bounce back in oil and metal prices will be continued and it can at least stay around these levels which will be very profitable for these companies.
