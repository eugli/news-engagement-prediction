We now face the sad reality that, for the next four years at least, some version of containment will have to be our policy towards the United States. \nTerritorial expansion, of course, is not the issue, as it was then. But the policies of the United States under President Donald Trump, it grows more clear each day, cannot be regarded in the same light as those of any president we have known. On trade, on defence, on international law, in its choice of allies as much as its antagonists, his administration is not only wholly indifferent to the international order that presidents of both parties have laboured to build over seven decades, but actively hostile to it. \nI think this is the correct lens through which to view the challenge confronting Justin Trudeau, as he prepares for his first summit meeting with Trump. There has been much discussion of what sort of “tone” Trudeau should strike: Should he forthrightly condemn such gross abdications of responsibility as the executive order suspending all refugee admissions for the next 120 days — indefinitely, in the case of Syria — or the ban on all travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries? Or should he, in the interests of good trade relations, grit his teeth, look the other way, and cozy up to the president, in the ingratiating style Japan’s prime minister adopted on his visit? Perhaps some ungainly combination of the two? \nTo which the only answer is: whatever you do, do it not alone. To be sure, the prime minister has the particular task of dealing with a leader who, to speak precisely, presents with a variety of known personality disorders; who knows less about foreign policy, or any policy, than the average doorman or taxi driver; who has no visible moral compass, is unconstrained by any norm of personal, political or presidential conduct, and seems determined to avenge any slight to his monstrous vanity. \nAnd yes, I’d prefer that my prime minister spoke up for what is right, even at some cost to Canada’s economic interests — just as one would hope he would with respect to China, or Russia, or any world power. That doesn’t require that he be needlessly provocative. But the sort of Finlandization scenario that seems to be in vogue in some quarters, in which we would sit quietly to one side and hope not to fall under Trump’s ravenous eye, strikes me as not only dishonourable, but futile. At some point we will, and will find all our prostration and self-abasement has been for nothing. \nOr rather, it will very likely have made things worse. To defend our interests, as much as our values, we will have to start setting boundaries early — picking our battles, yes, but firmly and patiently asserting our rights. And if we are to do so effectively, we will need to do so in concert with other countries. The widely varying reaction to the travel ban, with some world leaders, like Germany’s Angela Merkel, speaking out clearly against it, while others, like our own, couched their response in cleverly ambiguous tweets, must not be repeated. Neither was it sensible for Canada, in its first flustered response to Trump’s demands to renegotiate NAFTA, to appear so eager to abandon Mexico to its fate. \nThis is exactly what Trump wants. This is his foreign policy, or at any rate Steve Bannon’s: to cast off entangling alliances; to break up even those, such as the European Union, of which it is not a part; to do everything bilaterally, in which negotiations he supposes the United States, with its size and might, will always prevail. It is an exceedingly pinched construction of the American national interest — Trump sees every issue in terms of winners and losers, rather than mutual or collective benefit — but in that narrow sense he is probably right. \nSo we had better, as Ben Franklin said, hang together — “or most assuredly we will all hang separately.” The same is true of Trump’s domestic opponents, for example in the business community: so long as each company is left to deal with him separately, he will pick them off one by one. Only by presenting a united front can they hope to defend themselves.
