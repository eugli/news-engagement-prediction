Green called Pierce out for not having a farewell tour like Kobe Bryant did last season, and Pierce was clearly still thinking about that smack talk after the game when he tweeted the below shot at the Warriors: \nThough the Warriors won the NBA title as recently as 2015 and the Clippers have never even made the NBA Finals, Golden State is going to face 3-1 jokes until it clinches another championship. \nPierce didn't play a single minute in the Clippers' loss on Thursday night, so his tweet rings a little hollow in this case, but he's still one of the league's best trash talkers and has been for years. \nThough Pierce has only been with the Clippers since last year, Los Angeles hasn't won at Oracle Arena since 2011. Unless the two teams meet in the playoffs this year, the streak will carry over into next season. \nThat said, unless the Warriors win the title this year, the 3-1 jokes will continue to come from fans and opponents alike (just ask the Cleveland Indians).
