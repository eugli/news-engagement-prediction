Which rookies outplayed their draft position and which did not live up to expectations? We hit the reset button and figure out how the first round would shake out if teams could do it all over again. Risers \n1. Dak Prescott, QB Cowboys \nIt didn't take Prescott long to prove he could a serviceable starting quarterback in the NFL. Yes, he had one of the better supporting casts in the league around him which certainly made his job easier, but don't sell the Rookie of the Year short. His stellar rookie campaign was legit. He showed poise in the pocket, the ability to read coverages and to make changes at the line of scrimmage. He played well beyond his years. \nSo why didn't he overtake Jared Goff as the No. 1 pick? The Rams quarterback still possesses the highest ceiling of any passer in the draft, and he flashed his potential on tape despite playing behind an inept offensive line in an outdated offense. Put Goff on the Cowboys, and we would have seen similar results. As much as I love Dak, I still think Goff will be the best QB from the 2016 class. pic.twitter.com/XUFFXJDSMg — Steven Ruiz (@theStevenRuiz) February 17, 2017 \n2. Tyreek Hill, WR Chiefs \nHill is simply the most electrifying player in the NFL. He's a threat to score every time he touches the ball. He would've went much higher in both the real draft and this re-draft if not for major character concerns. Hill pled guilty to domestic assault after a 2014 incident involving his pregnant girlfriend. \n3. Jatavis Brown, LB Chargers \nThe draft nerds on the internet adored Brown before the draft, and the Chargers rookie proved them all right with a fantastic debut season. In only seven starts, the ball-hawking linebacker came up with 63 tackles, six passes defensed, two forced fumbles and 3.5 sacks. Fallers \n1. Laquon Treadwell, WR Vikings \nI wouldn't write off Tradwell as bust just yet, but he was certainly a disappointment in 2016. Mike Zimmer is notoriously wary of rookies, which may have been one of the reasons the young receiver was unable to get a lot of snaps for a weak Vikings receiving corp. Treadwell will have a lot of pressure on him heading into his second season. If he doesn't produce in Year 2, we can start throwing around the B-word. \n2. Josh Doctson, WR Redskins \nThis was a bit of a luxury pick for Washington at the time, so Doctson losing essentially his entire rookie season to injury really hurts a team that was so close to making the playoffs. Had Washington taken a position of need in the first round, the season may have ended differently. Then again, this pick should help the Redskins manage the cap with both DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garcon headed for free agency. \n3. Ronnie Stanley, LT Ravens \nStanley did not disappoint in his rookie season, but he was always a bit of a reach for the Ravens, who may have been scared off by Laremy Tunsil's infamous draft night video . Stanley was the first tackle taken in the draft but was outplayed by the three tackles taken after him in the first round, Jack Conklin, Tunsil and Taylor Decker. Winners \n1. Chicago Bears \nThe Bears nailed this draft, landing three players who appear in the first round of our re-draft. Leonard Floyd, the team's actual first-round pick, was productive when healthy and will be a load to handle when he puts on more weight. Cody Whitehair was one of the best centers in the league and should be the team's anchor in the middle for the next decade. And Jordan Howard was the perfect replacement for Matt Forte in the Chicago backfield. \n2. Kansas City Chiefs \nDespite not owning a first-round pick, the Chiefs managed to land two first-round worthy talents in the draft. Chris Jones is a monster in the middle of the defensive line, and Hill is already one of the league's best playmakers. \n3. Dallas Cowboys \nThe Cowboys found a franchise quarterback and running back in one draft. You can't ask for much more than that. Now imagine if second-round pick Jaylon Smith recovers from a devastating knee injury in his final college game. Smith would have been a top pick if not for the injury, and he appears to be recovering well. — Jaylon Smith (@thejaylonsmith) February 15, 2017 Losers \n1. Minnesota Vikings \nThe Vikings did not know it at the time, but they really needed to nail this draft. We've already covered Treadwell's struggles, but Minnesota's later picks did not fare much better. GM Rick Spielman has done some good work in prior drafts, but that was not the case here. Minnesota will not have a first-round pick in this year's draft after dealing it in the Sam Bradford trade. \n2. Indianapolis Colts \nThe Colts went with a center in the first-round but could have waited until the second (or traded down) and picked up Whitehair, who emerged as the best rookie center in the league. Fortunately for Colts fans, the man behind their lackluster draft classes over the last few seasons is now gone, as Indianapolis finally parted ways with Ryan Grigson. \n3. San Francisco 49ers \nDeForest Buckner is going to be a star in this league, but the 49ers are on this list for two reasons: (1) Taking Joshua Garnett with their second first-rounder was seen as a reach at the time and the first-year guard did not prove the experts wrong after struggling through his rookie season. (2) Chip Kelly reportedly wanted to draft Dak Prescott but former GM Trent Baalke overruled him . The franchise would have been in much better shape with Prescott on the roster.
