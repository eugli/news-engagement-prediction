The research firm expects the global smartphone AMOLED panel market to improve tremendously in 2017 and reach up to $57 billion by 2020, thanks to increasing demand from Apple ( for its next iPhone , Apple Watch , and new MacBook Pros ) and some Chinese smartphone brands . \nSamsung Display started investing heavily in the mass production of flexible AMOLED panels for smartphones last year. Apart from LG Display , other AMOLED panel manufacturers from China and Japan have started planning to invest in mass producing smartphone AMOLED panels as well. However, Samsung is expected to capture a majority of the market, thanks to its technical superiority and higher investment compared to other brands.
