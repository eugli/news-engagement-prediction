Bouchard, appeared alongside fellow tennis stars Caroline Wozniacki and Serena Williams in this year's edition of the international magazine that was released in last week.\n\n\"I've gotten that, over the last couple of years, I've done a photo shoot anywhere and it's like 'oh God, get back on the tennis court... what are you doing, go practise.' You have to deal with that hate and not take it personally. It's been a couple of years now,\" she was quoted as saying by CBS Sports.\n\"There's nothing wrong if you have success and it opens doors for other activities, like being in Sports Illustrated. Why not? I would be crazy not to take advantage of that. Why limit yourself?
