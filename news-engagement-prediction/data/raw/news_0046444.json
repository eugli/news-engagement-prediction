The mayor also warned the corporators against using unparliamentary words and levelling personal allegations in the meetings. \n\nThe corporators will have the choice of depositing their mobile phones with security officials or switching them off before entering the meeting halls. During the board meetings, many corporators are seen taking selfies and loading them on social networking sites. \n\nThe mayor also made it clear that the members will address only the Chair and will strictly follow the time limit given. \n\nThe AMC's board meeting on the civic body's annual budget had turned unruly recently with both the Congress and the BJP trading charges. Congress corporators also damaged mikes and other properties after the ruling BJP suspended a Congress councillor belonging to a minority community. The Congress, on the other hand, blamed the BJP for the unruly scenes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T15:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T07:44:05.192+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
