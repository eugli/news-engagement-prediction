By: Express Web Desk | New Delhi | Updated: February 23, 2017 8:21 am A screen grab of the Google Doodle. \nScientists from NASA have discovered nine exoplanets beyond our solar system revolving around a small, cold star – which points to the possibility of liquid water and life. The announcement was made yesterday by scientists from the space organisation and is being seen as one of the biggest announcements made by it yet. Google has dedicated a doodle to the discovery that shows a telescope looking out towards space from a circle, representing the earth, with the moon by its side. \nScientists have said that they need to ascertain whether the atmosphere of the rocky planets offers a hospitable environment for sustaining life. This new planet system has been located inside our galaxy less than 40 light years away in the constellation Aquarius. The planets were found to be circling around the cool, dwarf star called Trappist-1, which is roughly the size of Jupiter. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T09:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:54:04.524+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
