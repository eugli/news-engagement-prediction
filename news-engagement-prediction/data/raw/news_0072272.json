Most of us don't think about our relationships in such exact terms (\"cousin\" seems good enough), so many of us aren't very familiar with what these words mean. When tracing your family history , however, it can be important to understand the various types of cousin relationships. What is a Second Cousin? \nThe degree of cousin relationship is based on the most recent direct ancestor that two people have in common. First cousins are the people in your family who have two of the same grandparents as you. Second cousins have the same great-grandparents as you, but not the same grandparents.

These types of relationships can be difficult to determine and it is usually easiest to chart them one at a time (through one family line and then through the other line).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:30:20.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
