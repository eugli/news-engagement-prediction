Hingle-USA TODAY Sports \nFormer NFL wide receiver Robert Meachem was sentenced to 30 days in jail after failing to pay nearly $400,000 in alimony and child support. Meachem began serving that sentence Monday. \nMeachem could be released earlier if he pays his ex-wife, Andrea Rhodes, $100,000, but barring that, he will remain in jail until March 15, according to court documents obtained by the New Orleans Times-Picayune . \nMeachem, who made more than $20 million during his eight-year career, and Rhodes divorced in November 2015, according to court records. He was ordered to pay $20,000 a month in spousal and child support for the couple's two children, but attorneys for Rhodes asked the court last year to hold Meachem in contempt for failing to make payments.
