I’m done with it because this is true.” \nJenkins later told reporters the mix-up was “unfortunate” but said he was elated to have won the night’s top honour. \nBut Moonlight star Mahershala Ali, who won Best Supporting Actor, admitted the conclusion threw him for a loop. \n“I don’t want to go up there and take anything from someone,” he said afterward. “It’s very hard to feel joy in a moment like that.” What could have caused the envelope mix-up? \nAccording to reports, the initial mix-up may have been caused by a so-called fail safe for Oscar presenters. Duplicate envelopes for each award are reportedly held in the wings in case anything goes wrong with a presenter, The Guardian reported. \nSome have speculated Beatty was handed the duplicate envelope for the Best Actress award, which had just been given to La La Land’s Stone, instead of the card for Best Picture. \nA close up of Beatty’s hand shows he was indeed holding the Best Actress envelope on stage; however, Stone had already accepted her award and was in possession of it. That means Beatty must have had the duplicate. Proof Warren Beatty was given the \"Actress In A Leading Role\" envelope. Yep, someone is getting fired at @TheAcademy . #BestPicture #Oscars pic.twitter.com/dDmHLwocnv \n— SuCh (@SuCh) February 27, 2017 \n“I think everyone’s in a state of confusion still,” said Stone. Later the actress, who pledged her deep love of Moonlight , added, “Is that the craziest Oscar moment of all time? Cool!” \nIt was a shocking upset considering La La Land came in with 14 nominations, a record that tied it with Titanic and All About Eve . \nWATCH BELOW: Emma Stone on her Best Actress win for ‘La La Land,’ and Best Picture mixup \nJenkins’ coming-of-age drama, made for just $1.5 million, is an unusually small Oscar winner. Having made just over $22 million at the box office as of Sunday, it’s one of the lowest grossing best-picture winners ever – but also one of the most critically adored. \nHowever, as of Monday morning, the envelope snafu seemed to have eclipsed Moonlight ‘s big win on social media, as the globally trending hashtag #BestPicture contained more reaction to the mix-up than the movie’s win.
