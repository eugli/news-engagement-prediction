After they're here we will think about it.\" \n\nKohli's men are looking to set a new milestone after equalling India's record of five consecutive Test series triumphs against England, New Zealand, West Indies, South Africa and Sri Lanka in the past 18 months. \n\nBangladesh held India to a draw in June 2015 in a rain-affected Test in Fatullah the last time they met. \n\nThey have lost six of eight home Tests against India with two drawn but now get a chance to face them away from home for the first time since gaining full status 17 years ago. \n\nBangladesh's Test win in the drawn two-match series against England last October has given the team belief that they can compete against the top Test nations \n\nAnd despite the subsequent 2-0 defeat in New Zealand, Indian conditions should be more favourable to their spin-heavy bowling attack. \n\nBangladesh's captain and wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim played down the significance of Thursday's Test, even if the invitation to India has been a long time coming. \n\n\"I don't believe that this is a historic Test. To me, this is just another Test,\" Rahim said. \n\n\"Yes, we are happy and excited to show the world what our team is capable of doing in India but I am not really thinking about the number of years after which we are going to play a Test in India.\" \n\nBangladesh will be without opening batsman Imrul Kayes who pulled a thigh muscle in a warm-up match on Monday while left-arm fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman, who had a recent shoulder problem, was left out of the squad because of a lack of match fitness. \n\nSoumya Sarkar is now expected to open the batting alongside Tamim Iqbal and paceman Shafiul Islam returns. \n\nIndia are expected to make one change from the side that won the final Test against England in December as Saha returns from injury.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T17:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T07:29:17.935+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
