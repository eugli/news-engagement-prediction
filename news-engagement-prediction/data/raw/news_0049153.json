A + A - Kangana Ranaut. \nKangana believes in setting her own rules, be it in Bollywood or a TV show she appears in as guest. No doubt, she is bold, blunt and brilliant and that reflects in her choice of work. She's also carrying a lot of baggage from the past--as an outsider, she had a tough time in the film industry and was bullied about everything, from her accent, eccentricity, to her fashion choices. \nAfter shining in back-to-back women-oriented movies and giving Khans and Kapoors a run for their money, Kangana is now in a position to pose some hard-hitting questions to a certain mainstream faces of the industry. She got the perfect opportunity to do so when she appeared on Karan Johar's chat show Koffee With Karan on Sunday, and owned it completely. So much so that we actually started to picture Kangana in Karan's shoes. \nIs it the right time for the Queen of Bollywood to jump onto the TV bandwagon? We really think so, and we have our reasons. \nAlso read: Here's why Kangana Ranaut wanted to slap Sugandha Mishra \n1. She will avoid the cliched questions : Kangana Ranaut was primarily bullied by industry folks because of her eccentric choices. Yet, she stood by them and proved herself. On Koffee With Karan on Sunday, she criticised Karan Johar for asking frivolous questions on his show. As a host, we would expect her to avoid the typical queries and throw some Kangana-sque questions to the guests, which will surely be an enriching experience for everyone. \n2. She will hopefully have a unique set of guests: Kangana last night accused Karan of nepotism. We are hoping, in her own show, she would invite the non-mainstream actors we don't get to see on such chat shows. She might take a cue from Kapil Sharma, and invite the likes of Anna Hazare or Wadali brothers. She could in fact very well go for a women-only chat show, and invite successful women from all walks of life. \n3. She will explore the unseen side of a guest: If you have seen Kangana's episode of Koffee With Karan, her confessions encouraged Saif to open up and reveal a bit more about himself. We are sure, her guests would end up revealing an unknown side about themselves, which will be a win-win for the makers and the viewers. \n4. We will get to know more about Kangana: We all knew very little about Karan Johar before Koffeeâ€¦ We now know a lot more about his friends, his life and his career. We would be interested in those little anecdotes that Kangana would share in the course of the show. Her journey after all has been fascinating so far. \nKangana, on Koffee, had revealed that she would name her autobiography as Dancing Barefoot. Wait, we have got her chat show's title--Dancing Barefoot with Kangana Ranaut.
