He's the reason the American dream has come true not only for me but for my dad, who I had a chance to give a business to. I love Irsay and I love my teammates and all the young guys we have, so it's very difficult. But whenever you're a creative person, whenever you can make somebody laugh, that's real fulfillment. You're making somebody's day better and this is giving me that (opportunity).\" \nMcAfee, originally a 2009 seventh-round pick out of West Virginia, is a two-time Pro Bowler, including this past season. But after meeting with Colts owner Jim Irsay for more than an hour on Monday to inform him of his decision, the 29-year-old is now moving on to life after football. McAfee will remain in Indianapolis where he will work for Barstool Sports . \n\"My life has been littered with terrible decisions, this is at the top of the list,\" he told IndyStar Wednesday night from Houston, where Barstool Rundown is running on Comedy Central all week. \nMcAfee leaves the game with two years left on the five-year, $14.5 million deal he signed in 2014. And while he loved his eight years in the league, he was looking for something more beyond kicking a football. \n\"The NFL is really cool, and if I was a quarterback or played a position where I could have more of a grip on the game, I'd really love it. But I didn't feel fulfillment out of punting. I didn't feel fulfillment the way I did once I started making people laugh. Like 'cool, I'm really impacting people.' Now I'll have the freedom to do that full time.\" \n\"Whenever you find out what you're supposed to be, that's a cool thing. To be in the NFL, you have to focus on punting, on being great. There are only 32 jobs and it takes total focus. People think I was always out doing stuff but really, I never went out anymore, I was a homebody. It takes a lot of attention to be an NFL player, but now I want to turn that focus to something I feel like I should be doing.\" \nThe Colts, who hired a new general manager last week, are now looking for a new punter. So while he's leaving, he won't be soon forgotten. — Indianapolis Colts (@Colts) February 2, 2017 One of the first people to greet me when I got to the place!
