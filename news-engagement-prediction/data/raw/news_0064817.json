Due to a broken ankle, the 26-year-old played in only five games , accumulating 360 rushing yards and scoring no touchdowns. During the 2015 season, Lacy gained serious weight, which led to his worst full year in the league. But Lacy is trying to make 2017 his year—by staying lean this offseason. \nRELATED: Eddie Lacy Isn't Fat Anymore Thanks to P90X With an injured ankle, it would be easy for the one-time Pro Bowler to gain all the weight he lost for the 2016 season, but it looks like Lacy is working to keep it off. Recently, he showed himself performing Pool Sprints via social media. Not only is this exercise great for cardio, but it also doesn't aggravate his recovering ankle. \n— Eddie Lacy (@Lil_Eazy_Ana_42) February 21, 2017 \nAccording to other posts, Lacy has not only been rehabbing his ankle, but also eating healthier since the injury. He is a free agent this year, so it's a smart tactic for him to show off his health. Judging from the video above and the photos below, he's looking good.
