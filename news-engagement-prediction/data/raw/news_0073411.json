A new $500 device developed by researchers at the University of Michigan improves upon existing tools used for minimally invasive surgery and could help surgeons in small and remote hospitals do certain precise medical procedures that are currently performed by a $2 million robotic system at large medical centers.\nRecommended for You How a College Kid Made His Honda Civic Self-Driving for $700 Neural Network Learns to Synthetically Age Faces, and Make Them Look Younger, Too Quantum Computers Finally Go Head-to-Head Using Virtual Reality Underwater Is Weird (but Fun) AI Software Juggles Probabilities to Learn from Less Data The device, which is being commercialized by FlexDex Surgery, is a handheld instrument for making small incisions and stitching in the body. It mounts to a surgeon's arm and locates the device’s center of rotation at the same point as the surgeon’s wrist, so that it operates like an extension of the arm. The device has been used for the first time for an abdominal surgery at the University of Michigan Health System, and its inventors say it could be used for a range of other procedures like hernia repairs, hysterectomies, and prostate removal surgeries.\nUniversity of Michigan professors Jim Geiger, a pediatric surgeon, and Shorya Awtar, a mechanical engineer, developed the robot-like device, which functions without a motor or computer chip. They say the tool can do many of the same tasks as the Da Vinci robot, made by Intuitive Surgical.\nRobotic surgery is an advanced form of minimally invasive surgery, known as laparoscopy, which uses smaller incisions than traditional surgery. Smaller incisions mean patients often heal faster with less pain.\nThe Da Vinci carries a hefty price tag of $2 million. It’s the only robotic surgical system approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but the cost puts it out of reach for smaller hospitals or those in developing countries. Intuitive Surgical has so far installed 3,803 Da Vinci robots worldwide, including 2,501 in the U.S. and 644 in Europe, according to its website.\nPeter Janu, a surgeon with Affinity Health System in rural Wisconsin, says he plans to use the FlexDex device. Janu splits his time between a larger community hospital with a Da Vinci robot and a small 25-bed medical center without a robot. He says he’ll use the handheld device at the smaller hospital for certain procedures he used to do with conventional laparoscopy tools.\nAwtar and Geiger don’t expect their device to replace existing Da Vinci systems in hospitals and health-care systems that already have them, but they say it will help bring minimally invasive surgery to parts of the world where many procedures are still being done with traditional surgery, “I don’t think robotic surgery is going to go away. But for many operations, you just don’t need all of what the robot brings,” Geiger says.\nGain the insight you need on digital technologies at EmTech Digital.\nRegister now", "external_links": ["https://d267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net/i/images/flexdexselect.jpg?sw=1024&cx=54&cy=0&cw=1279&ch=1700", "https://d267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net/i/images/flexdexselect.jpg?sw=2048&cx=54&cy=0&cw=1279&ch=1700", "https://d267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net/i/images/flexdexselect.jpg?sw=550&cx=54&cy=0&cw=1279&ch=1700", "https://d267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net/i/images/flexdexselect.jpg?sw=600&cx=54&cy=0&cw=1279&ch=1700", "https://d267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net/i/images/flexdexselect.jpg?sw=1700&cx=54&cy=0&cw=1279&ch=1700", "https://d267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net/i/images/flexdexselect.jpg?sw=850&cx=54&cy=0&cw=1279&ch=1700", "https://d267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net/i/images/flexdexselect.jpg?sw=1200&cx=54&cy=0&cw=1279&ch=1700", "https://d267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net/i/images/flexdexselect.jpg?sw=1100&cx=54&cy=0&cw=1279&ch=1700", "https://d267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net/i/images/flexdexselect.jpg?sw=802&cx=54&cy=0&cw=1279&ch=1700", "https://d267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net/i/images/flexdexselect.jpg?sw=401&cx=54&cy=0&cw=1279&ch=1700"], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:30:52.537+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
