It also did not contain Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto 's response.\nStill, the excerpt offers a rare and striking look at how the new president is conducting diplomacy behind closed doors. Trump's remarks suggest he is using the same tough and blunt talk with world leaders that he used to rally crowds on the campaign trail.\nA White House spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. The Mexican government said the account was not accurate.\nThe phone call between the leaders was intended to patch things up between the new president and his ally. The two have had a series of public spats over Trump's determination to have Mexico pay for the planned border wall, something Mexico steadfastly refuses to agree to.\nLast week, President Trump signed an executive order that started the ball rolling on his plan to build an \"impenetrable\" wall between the U.S. and Mexico. His proposal would see a wall built that covers 1,000 of the 1,900 mile long border but how much would it cost? A good place to start is by looking at the cost of the 650 miles of fencing that is currently in place which, with at a price of $2.8 million - $3.9 million per mile, has cost the U.S. government $7 billion. One study estimates that Trump's wall could cost $25 billion. Another suggested, minus labor & land acquisitions costs it could be $15 billion. In fact, concrete & cement alone could cost $1 billion. If Mexico refuses to pay for the all, the bill could land at te feet of Americans, costing each household an average of $120.

I think your military is scared. Our military isn't, so I just might send them down to take care of it.\"\nA person with access to the official transcript of the phone call provided only that portion of the conversation to The Associated Press. The person gave it on condition of anonymity because the administration did not make the details of the call public.\nThe Mexican website, Aristegui Noticias, on Tuesday published a similar account of phone call, based on the reporting of journalist Dolia Estevez . The report described Trump as humiliating Pena Nieto in a confrontational conversation.\nMexico's foreign relations department denied that account, saying it \"is based on absolute falsehoods,\" and later said the statement also applied to the excerpt provided to AP.\n\"The assertions that you make about said conversation do not correspond to the reality of it,\" the statement said. \"The tone was constructive and it was agreed by the presidents to continue working and that the teams will continue to meet frequently to construct an agreement that is positive for Mexico and for the United States.\"\nTrump has used the phrase \"bad hombres\" before. In an October presidential debate, he vowed to get rid the U.S. of \"drug lords\" and \"bad people.\"\n\"We have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out,\" he said. The phrase ricocheted on social media with Trump opponents saying he was denigrating immigrants.\nTrump's comment was in line with the new administration's bullish stance on foreign policy matters in general, and the president's willingness to break long-standing norms around the globe.\nBefore his inauguration, Trump spoke to the president of Taiwan, breaking long-standing U.S. policy and irritating China. His temporary ban on refugees and travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries, aimed at reviewing screening procedures to lessen the threat of extremist attacks, has caused consternation around the world.\nBut nothing has created the level of bickering as the border wall, a centerpiece of his campaign. Mexico has consistently said it would not pay for the wall and opposes it. Before the phone call, Pena Nieto canceled a planned visit to the United States.\nThe fresh fight with Mexico last week arose over trade as the White House proposed a 20 percent tax on imports from the key U.S. ally to finance the wall after Pena Nieto abruptly scrapped his Jan. 31 trip to Washington.\nThe U.S. and Mexico conduct some $1.6 billion a day in cross-border trade, and cooperate on everything from migration to anti-drug enforcement to major environmental issues.\nTrump tasked his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner — a real estate executive with no foreign policy experience — with managing the ongoing dispute, according to an administration official with knowledge of the call.\nAt a press conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May last week, Trump described his call with Pena Nieto as \"friendly.\"\nIn a statement, the White House said the two leaders acknowledged their \"clear and very public differences\" and agreed to work through the immigration disagreement as part of broader discussions on the relationship between their countries.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Mark Stevenson in Mexico City contributed to this report.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/56/70/37/12290010/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/56/71/01/12292179/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/56/70/14/12288775/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2017-02-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T03:11:12.696+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
