At a recent event, SRK was asked to comment on CBFC’s ban on Lipstick Under My Burkha but the actor dodged the question saying that he isn’t aware of the controversy. He said,” You can ask me about the politics in Uttar Pradesh as well after that. I have no idea as I was on holiday. So I don’t know.” Honestly, his reaction wasn’t surprising at all. The actor has spoken about what he feels about commenting on any current issues. In a podcast with AIB, the Raees actor took a dig at people questioning him about his stand. \nLipstick Under The Burkha is a documentary that speaks volumes about women empowerment and has even won awards internationally. But the CBFC refused to pass the film and banned it citing abusive language and being ‘lady oriented. A lot of actors and film makers came out to support the film and it has been in the news   The film stars Konkona Sen Sharma, Ratna Pathak Shah, Aahana Kumra, Plabita Borthakur, Sushant Singh, Vikrant Massey and Shashank Arora.

A lot of filmmakers like Kabir Khan, Sudhir Mishra, Neeraj Ghaywan, Farhan Akhtar and others slammed the CBFC for banning the film. The film has been showcased in quite a few film festivals abroad and has even won awards. It won the Spirit of Asia Award at the Tokyo International Film Festival and the Oxfam Award for best film on gender equality at the Mumbai Film Festival. \nAnd quite honestly, it does look like an interesting film judging from the screenshots and stills from the film. But Pahlaj Nihalani’s response to the issue was beyond outrageous. He said,” Have you heard of any big film being denied certification? How come so many films are being released if CBFC is acting as the moral police? The fact is that some of the producers don’t make films for the Indian audience; they make it for festival circuits or maybe something else. Their films are shown in festivals without any certificate after they seek special clearance from Information and Broadcasting ministry.” \nWhat are your thoughts on this?
