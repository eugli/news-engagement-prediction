Photo: YouTube \nKjellberg didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. \nPewDiePie's channel is one of the most subscribed on Alphabet's YouTube service, bringing in millions of dollars in advertising and partnership deals for the Swedish celebrity. While he's an important figure in video-gaming culture, Kjellberg is also one of the rare YouTube personalities to cross over into the mainstream. TMZ cameras have followed him around in Los Angeles and late-night talk hosts such as Stephen Colbert have welcomed him as a guest. SHARE Felix \"PewDiePie\" Kjellberg pictured in 2013. Photo: AP \nThe Wall Street Journal earlier reported that PewDiePie had posted nine videos with anti-Semitic jokes or Nazi imagery since August, though the Swedish YouTube star took some of them down subsequently. \nYouTube had banked on Kjellberg as one of the marquee names in its YouTube Red subscription service, which offers original programs such as \"Scare PewDiePie,\" a show that had been renewed for a second season. YouTube didn't respond to requests for comment. Advertisement \nKjellberg made about $US15 million last year as YouTube's highest-paid star, Forbes magazine said in December. He had more than 53 million subscribers to his main channel on YouTube as of late Monday. \nKjellberg has run afoul of big tech services before. Twitter briefly suspended his account last year after he posted a profile picture that could be viewed as obscene. Kjellberg made matters more confusing by claiming, in jest, that he had been suspended because he had joined the Islamic State. \nThe popularity of stars like Kjellberg among young viewers is a principal reason Disney paid $US675 million for Maker Studios in a deal struck in 2014. Disney has been a direct partner with Kjellberg, with Maker co-creating a YouTube network called Revelmode to showcase PewDiePie videos and related programming. \nThe YouTube star's behaviour is just the latest headache Disney has encountered with Maker, which has lost senior executives as Disney has attempts to retool it.
