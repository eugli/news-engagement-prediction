My Private Banker. That’s me, not Jude. Monday 20th February 2017 marked the day that a side project I began while working at Xero can quite happily no longer be called a “side project”. Frustrated at being charged un-arranged overdraft fees from my bank, I decided I would write some code to keep an eye on my bank accounts & move money between them should it need to, based on some pretty simple rules I set up. Jude + Google Home I soon realised I could provide a better banking experience than what my bank was offering if I just built it myself. So that’s what I set out to do. What turned out to now be Jude was originally an idea I had back in 2013 whilst growing up in my hometown of Arrowtown near the bottom of New Zealand’s South Island. At that time I was working at a golf course & doing some freelance / hobby web design work on the side. I knew (after my wife convinced me … Xx) that what I really wanted to do with my time was develop my own ideas further of which this Jude thing I dreamt up seemed most interesting. My wife also convinced me (some might say pushed … Xx) to apply for an “ actual ” IT job to first get some real world experience with someone that “ actually ” makes software that people “ actually ” pay for. Makes sense, I guess … Back in 2013, Xero was just starting to really take off so I thought, if I’m wanting to develop this Jude idea further then who better to learn from when trying to build a product people really love, than Xero? Without any qualifications or even a C.V. however I knew applying for a job the traditional way would be a long shot, so I set myself up with a Twitter account (everyone already knew everyone in Arrowtown, a small town in NZ) & immediately started to stalk Rod Drury , the founder & CEO of Xero, a prolific tweeter. Within a day or so, I saw an opportunity. Rod tweeted about wanting to redesign Xero’s careers page based on a slick website that they had recently been featured in. I thought if I could mock that up quickly & tweet a link back to Rod, at the very least I could get his attention & perhaps he might even offer me an “ actual ” job. So that’s what I did. I ripped off the design he liked, made sure it wasn’t “awful” on a mobile device, threw a bit of “Xero blue” at it then inserted a picture of Rod with a few other Xero staff as well as myself with the title of “future employee”. I knew I’d need a pretty URL to send back & also remember thinking I’m going to want him to remember my name. Conveniently I discovered my full name could be pieced together with the help of Switzerland or at least, their top level domain. So I promptly purchased benlyn.ch & redirected my newly created mock Xero careers page to it. On the 29th April 2013 I sent my first ever tweet. Rather tentatively, looking back, I replied to Rod Drury with, “ maybe something like this — benlyn.ch ”. Within 30 minutes of sending my reply Rod had emailed me back & sent a follow up tweet of his own … Within a couple of months my wife Ana & I along with our daughter Ella & son Jude (coincidence … ? All the good ‘ella’ domain names were taken) had moved north to Wellington where I spent the next 18 months working & learning from one of the world’s most innovative & disruptive companies, Xero , all the while continuing to develop this Jude idea in the background. We then moved further north to Auckland where we are now & I started working for EROAD , another of NZ’s great technology success stories. In the middle of last year I took the plunge. My side project was now, I thought at least, at a point where I could leave my full time paid job & try to bootstrap further development of Jude via consulting back to other companies that may find some of the work I was doing with Jude around chat bots & voice interfaces like Amazon’s Alexa & Google Home interesting for their own products & services. As you can probably guess, the first person I hit up for my new consulting gig was Rod, this time via email. True to form he fires back almost immediately. Without any fuss he agrees the technology is “cool” & before I know it, I’m back working with some of the Xero team helping thrash out the beginnings of Xero’s chat platform. And so here I am today. Monday officially marked the day that someone else decided there might just be something in this Jude thing. On Monday, along with 5 other great startups, I joined the 6 month Flux Accelerator based in Auckland & run out of The Icehouse . We both think my original idea from 2013 still holds true. Even more so today … I want a simple, clean, personalised & customised banking experience. I want someone to pro actively look out for me & my finances. I want someone to pay my bills on time, possibly even look for savings & investment opportunities. And I want to do all that from where, when & how I choose to. When you think about it … what I really want is a kind of like the service offered by a private banker. What if I could democratise private banking using modern technology? Jude + Facebook Messenger So together with Flux, we’re going to figure out how to do just that. With some late nights & little bit of luck, Jude, the private banker I built for myself might just become yours too. If you’dlike tofollow our journey then make sure you connect via both Facebook & Twitter . If you or someone you know could help, then leave me a comment, share this with your network or maybe you could even … send me a tweet :) Cheers.
