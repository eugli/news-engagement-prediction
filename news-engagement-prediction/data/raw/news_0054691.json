Naor and the justices’ block appear to have decided to cut a deal they did not prefer, rather than risk Shaked following through on her threat to pass a new Knesset law which would let her appoint justices without their vote.Currently, seven of the nine committee members must support appointees, effectively giving the three justices a veto.The selection of all four at once had put in question the path the Supreme Court will take on fateful issues such as the settlements, migrants, natural gas and human rights, for decades to come.The three blocks on the committee are the justices block of Supreme Court President Miriam Naor, Deputy President Elyakim Rubinstein and Salim Joubran; the political block of Shaked, Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon, MK Nurit Koren (Likud) and MK Robert Ilatov (Yisrael Beytenu); and the Israel Bar Association block of Ilana Sakar and Khaled Zoabi.In November, just days after Naor dealt a public blow to Shaked slamming her treatment of the court, the justice minister shifted attention by publishing a list of 28 candidates for the four Supreme Court slots opening up in 2017.Naor, Rubinstein, Joubran and Justice Zvi Zilbertal will all be stepping down at different points in the coming year.Though their retirement dates are spread out over several months, the committee was expected to select their replacements all at once.Earlier in November, in an unprecedented sign of open war, Naor severed relations with Shaked regarding negotiations about appointments of future justices over the justice minister’s “gun on the table” threats she has made through the media about pushing a bill through the Knesset allowing her and the political echelon to appoint judges against the Supreme Court’s wishes.For several days, stories have emerged without Shaked’s explicit approval, but with implied confirmations by sources close to her, that she would back a bill by Ilatov allowing appointments of four new justices to the Supreme Court with a mere majority of the committee – even if all of the justices on the committee oppose the candidates.Several years ago, the Knesset passed a law stating that seven of the nine members of the committee must support a candidate to be appointed to the Supreme Court. Though there are more politicians on the committee than justices, the presence of three justices on the committee – Naor, Rubinstein and Joubran – has meant that, effectively, the Supreme Court’s consent is needed to get an appointment through.
