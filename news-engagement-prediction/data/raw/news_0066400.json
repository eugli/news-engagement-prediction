The movie comes from Charlie McDowell and Justin Lader, and it stars Robert Redford as a scientist who has discovered irrefutable proof of an afterlife, prompting a wave of suicides all over the world. This new trailer presents that world with a more operatic tone, suggesting that this isn’t a small horror story about a handful of people but a grand horror story about the whole human race. The A.V. Club ’s A.A. Dowd said The Discovery was an “ambitious, convoluted genre tightrope act” that kept him “thoroughly engrossed” when he saw it at Sundance , and you’ll be able to see it for yourself on March 31.
