Kone immediately recognized what was wrong and stopped Borkovec from swallowing his tongue. The goalkeeper was able to breathe after Kone's help. \nTeam doctors eventually responded to Borkovec, and Kone was awarded \"Hero of the Match\" from the league. \nAfter the match, Kone posted to Facebook about the incident. \nHe wrote: \nI would like to say thank to God for having removed a colleague from the worst because without him we would know today invaded of regrettable thoughts. Thank also to all those who near or far have written to me or called for this gesture of sportmanship and humanity. I hope that Martin and Daniel will recover quickly to regain the football field. \nBorkovec also thanked Kone for his heroic action. He wrote in a Facebook post (translated from Czech): \nI would like to thank Kone Francis for rescue and emergency at today's game â€¦ I'm glad for the relief and thanks again !!!
