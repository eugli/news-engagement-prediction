While top Republicans have refused to disavow his charges of election fraud, they haven’t pushed for action on the issue, which remains a low priority for congressional leadership.\nThe vote in the House Administration Committee underscored, once again, the political differences between the Republican president and the party’s rank-and-file. The GOP majority on the committee eliminated the Election Assistance Commission, which was created by Congress after the 2000 Florida recount to upgrade voting technology and provide election-related information to federal entities, state officials and election administrators.\nRelated Articles January 30, 2017 Trump’s voter fraud expert was registered in 3 states during election January 30, 2017 Colorado House gives preliminary nod to ballot selfies January 26, 2017 Trump to launch probe into unproven voter fraud claim January 25, 2017 Donald Trump announces “major” voter fraud investigation January 24, 2017 Colorado looks to repeal ban on ballot selfies, but bill faces a hurdle Republicans say the commission is a prime example of government waste. They’ve been introducing legislation to end the commission for years with little success.\n“If we’re looking at reducing the size of government this is a perfect example of something that can be eliminated,” said Rep. Gregg Harper, the committee chairman. “We don’t need fluff.”\nHarper said he hadn’t spoken to Trump about the legislation. “He’s certainly welcome to call me at any time,” he said.\nThe bill was opposed by committee Democrats and voting rights groups, who argued that the federal agency plays a vital role in protecting elections from hacking and other types of interference.\n“At a time when the vast majority of the country’s voting machines are outdated and in need of replacement, and after an election in which foreign criminals already tried to hack state voter registration systems, eliminating the EAC poses a risky and irresponsible threat to our election infrastructure,” said Wendy Weiser, the democracy program director at the Brennan Center for Justice.\nThe committee also voted to terminate the public financing system, which provides major party presidential nominees a lump sum grant of roughly $94.14 million in the general election. But by accepting the grant, a candidate may not raise any additional funds and is severely limited in how much of his own money he can give or lend to his campaign.\nPresident Barack Obama effectively ended the practice of candidates taking general election public financing in 2008, when he chose not to accept it. His Republican rival John McCain took the grant that year and was swamped by the Obama campaign’s spending. Neither Hillary Clinton nor Trump accepted public financing this year.\nMoney for the public financing of campaigns is collected through voluntary $3 checkoffs on taxpayers’ returns. The checkoffs do not affect how much money a taxpayer owes.\nThe legislation would devote $63 million of the available funds to pediatric cancer research. The remainder would be returned to the Treasury for deficit reduction.\nIt is not clear if the full House will vote on the measures.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T04:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T08:14:07.668+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
