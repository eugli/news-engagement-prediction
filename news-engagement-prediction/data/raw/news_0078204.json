As was only natural, the abbot seemed to me, as the village priest had once seemed to my father, the highest and most desirable ideal.- Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf , Vol. 1 Chapter 1 4. Adolf Hitler: Christianity and the Holy German Reich As long as leadership from above was not lacking, the people fulfilled their duty and obligation overwhelmingly. Whether Protestant pastor or Catholic priest, both together and particularly at the first flare, there really existed in both camps but a single holy German Reich, for whose existence and future each man turned to his own heaven.- Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf , Vol. 1 Chapter 3 5. Adolf Hitler: Significance of the Religion of Love The more abstractly correct and hence powerful this idea will be, the more impossible remains its complete fulfillment as long as it continues to depend on human beings... If this were not so, the founders of religion could not be counted among the greatest men of this earth... In its workings, even the religion of love is only the weak reflection of the will of its exalted founder; its significance, however, lies in the direction which it attempted to give to a universal human development of culture, ethics, and morality.- Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf , Vol. 1 Chapter 8 6. Adolf Hitler: Personification of the Devil ....the personification of the devil as the symbol of all evil assumes the living shape of the Jew.- Adolf Hitler (following the position of Martin Luther), Mein Kampf , Vol. 1 Chapter 11 7. Adolf Hitler: Christians Should Deal with Atheistic Jews And the founder of Christianity made no secret indeed of his estimation of the Jewish people. When He found it necessary, He drove those enemies of the human race out of the Temple of God; because then, as always, they used religion as a means of advancing their commercial interests. But at that time Christ was nailed to the Cross for his attitude towards the Jews; whereas our modern Christians enter into party politics and when elections are being held they debase themselves to beg for Jewish votes. They even enter into political intrigues with the atheistic Jewish parties against the interests of their own Christian nation.- Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf , Vol. 1 Chapter 11 8. Adolf Hitler: As a Christian, I Feel that My Lord and Savior was a Fighter My feelings as a Christian points me to my Lord and Savior as a fighter. It points me to the man who once in loneliness, surrounded by a few followers, recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned men to fight against them and who, God's truth! was greatest not as a sufferer but as a fighter. In boundless love as a Christian and as a man I read through the passage which tells us how the Lord at last rose in His might and seized the scourge to drive out of the Temple the brood of vipers and adders. ...Today, after two thousand years, with deepest emotion I recognize more profoundly than ever before the fact that it was for this that He had to shed his blood upon the Cross. ...- Adolf Hitler, speech on April 12, 1922 9. Adolf Hitler: Fascism is Closer to Christianity than Liberalism or Marxism The fact that the Curia is now making its peace with Fascism shows that the Vatican trusts the new political realities far more than did the former liberal democracy with which it could not come to terms. ...The fact that the Catholic Church has come to an agreement with Fascist Italy ...proves beyond doubt that the Fascist world of ideas is closer to Christianity than those of Jewish liberalism or even atheistic Marxism...- Adolf Hitler in an article in the Völkischer Beobachter , February 29, 1929, on the new Lateran Treaty between Mussolini's fascist government and the Vatican 10. Adolf Hitler: Compromises with Atheism Destroy Religious, Ethical Values By its decision to carry out the political and moral cleansing of our public life, the Government is creating and securing the conditions for a really deep and inner religious life. The advantages for the individual which may be derived from compromises with atheistic organizations do not compare in any way with the consequences which are visible in the destruction of our common religious and ethical values.
