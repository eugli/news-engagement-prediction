Netanyahu rushed to Trump's defense at a joint news conference in Washington last week after the president appeared to sidestep an Israeli reporter's question about anti-Semitic incidents in the United States. \"I've known the president and I've known his family and his team for a long time, and there is no greater supporter of the Jewish people and the Jewish state than President Donald Trump. I think we should put that to rest,\" Netanyahu said. Several Jewish community centers in the United States were evacuated briefly on Monday after receiving bomb threats, the JCC Association of North America said. Another center was evacuated on Tuesday in San Diego, California, police said. Vandals toppled about 170 headstones at a Jewish cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri over the weekend. In Sydney, Netanyahu called for an international effort to combat \"resurgent anti-Semitism\" around the world.
