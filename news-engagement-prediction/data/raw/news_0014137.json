We’re obviously going to play in the NRL week to week and the young guys, sometimes it’s hard for them,” Reynolds told AAP. Ponga excites Knights fans 0:45 \nNRL: Newcastle fans have a lot to look forward to after a great showing for the Cowboys in their first game at the Auckland Nines. February 4th 2017 /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/NRL/ Ponga excites Knights fans \n“I’ve played premier league, you don’t really get to show yourself sometimes because you’re playing at the park or whatever. I don’t necessarily think it’s a bad thing. \n“I know where the fans are coming from in some ways. You don’t want to lose in any game. But Des is the boss and whatever he says goes.” \nHasler’s contempt for the Nines has been made clear over the tournament’s four-year existence, with the big name coach never travelling to the event and regularly sending understrength squads. \nUnder NRL rules clubs must name one of their top five earners and 12 of their top 25 first grade squad for the Nines, but both Klemmer and Reynolds watched the entire first day’s play from the sidelines.
