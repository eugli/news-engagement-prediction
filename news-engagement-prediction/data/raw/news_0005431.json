But a day later, Bennett said he would no longer serve after the News and Tribune reported he hadn’t lived in the county long enough to hold office. State law requires a council member to live in the county for at least one year. Bennett told the newspaper he had lived in Clark County for about six months. \nThe development is the latest chapter in the high-profile Republican’s political career. He took a break after losing re-election as state schools chief in 2012 and resigning as the Florida education commissioner a year later. \nAfter his selection, Bennett told IndyStar Wednesday that filling the vacancy was an “opportunity to do something that I think is really positive.” \n“It’s just to serve the community I grew up in in a very positive way,” Bennett said. “I wanted to be a service to our county given my background. I have a good understanding of fiscal policy and budgeting.” \nAfter learning he was ineligible for the seat, Bennett indicated he hadn't planned to stay on the council for long. Bennett told the News and Tribune that he \"had no intentions of running\" when the current term was up. \nBennett and Clark County GOP Chair Jamey Noel didn’t immediately return requests for comment. \nA local attorney Larry Wilder said he did an incomplete read of state law and told Bennett he could apply for the vacancy on the council. \n“I take full responsibility for giving bad legal advice,” Wilder told IndyStar. \nBecause Bennett hadn’t been sworn in yet, the Clark County GOP will caucus again to choose another replacement for the seat, Wilder said. \n“It’s just a great loss for us,” Wilder said of Bennett not being able to serve. “His skill set was unlike anyone else in the community.” \nBennett moved back to the Hoosier state in 2013 after he stepped down from the Florida position amid questions of his handling of the Indiana office. Bennett had faced an investigation by the state’s inspector general. He consistently denied any wrongdoing. \nIn 2015, the Marion County prosecutor’s office announced it would not file criminal charges against Bennett. Marion County Prosecutor Terry Curry made the decision following a review of investigatory records that had alleged Bennett had improperly used state resources, violated the state’s “ghost employment” statute and changed the state’s A-F school rating system to benefit a charter school run by a prominent Republican donor. \nEarlier, the state’s Ethics Commission found minimal violations and fined Bennett $5,000. The commission also cleared Bennett of allegations of manipulating A-F ratings. \nAs Indiana schools chief, his support for a series of education reforms, including playing a pivotal role in forming the state’s private school voucher program and revamping teacher evaluations, defined his term in office. Bennett’s backing of those reforms angered public education advocates who saw the changes as anti-teacher. \nNoel said Wednesday that Bennett ran unopposed for the council seat and that he “just wants to give back.” Bennett grew up in Clark County where he served as a local school administrator before winning statewide office. He served as superintendent of Greater Clark County Schools and assistant superintendent of New Albany-Floyd County Schools. \nBennett would have earned about $13,000 a year in his role on the council. \nThe Associated Press, IndyStar researcher Cathy Knapp and IndyStar reporters Brian Eason, Jill Disis and Tony Cook contributed to this story. \nCall IndyStar reporter Chelsea Schneider at (317) 444-6077.
