The Australian X \nThe US Defence Department is considering boots on the ground in northern Syria in an attempt to speed up the battle against Islamic State. \nThe Pentagon is planning a proposal for combat troops to join the coalition’s fight against IS, currently waged by air. \n“It’s possible that you may see conventional forces hit the ground in Syria for some period of time,” a defence official told CNN. However the official emphasised that any decision is ultimately up to the President. \nDonald Trump has ordered his defence secretary to come up with a proposal to combat ISIS before the end of the month. \nIf the idea was approved by Mt Trump, it would significantly alter US military operations in Syria where until now only small teams of special operations forces have operated. \n.
