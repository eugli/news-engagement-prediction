ADVERTISEMENT \n“It’s about having better relationships,” he said. \nHe noted there was no way to verify that employees do not use their hour for other purposes than spending time with their partners or spouses. \n“You can’t guarantee that a worker doesn’t go out for a walk instead,” Muskos said, adding that employers needed to trust their employees. \nMuskos said he “saw no reason” why the motion wouldn’t pass. \nAfter the Finns and the French, Swedish full-time employees worked the least in Europe with only 1,685 hours on average in 2015, according to a study by economic research institute Coe-Rexecode. \nBrits worked an average of 1,900 hours and Germans 1,847 hours in 2015.
