Get out of the house you lived in with them.\" \nMs Moore is only alive today because of the bravery of her five children who fought off her ex-partner after he shot her left arm at such close range that it was almost severed. \nShe has had more than 15 major operations since her attack, but still faces the possibility her arm may have to be amputated. \nMs Bradford's death has brought back the trauma of her experience nearly three years ago. \n\"I've had periods, I don't talk about it a lot, but I've had months where I can't even leave the bed. It's hard. There's no-one there.\" Calls for public review of bail system \nQueensland's Attorney-General Yvette D'Ath has ordered an internal review of Queensland's bail system after it was revealed that Bradford was on bail when he murdered his wife and then took his own life. \nOffenders may be forced to prove why they should be released under the proposed changes. \nIt has sparked concern that the review will not consult those affected by domestic violence.
