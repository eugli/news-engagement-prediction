Thomson Senior Editor, Taste, The Huffington Post \nIt’s no secret that we love dessert here at HuffPost Taste ― we are always finding excuses to get more into our lives. But there’s an entire nation producing mouth-watering desserts that we haven’t fully experienced yet. We’re talking about the desserts coming out of Iran, and it’s about time we’ve explored these sweets. \nIran makes some of the best desserts out there ― they rival even the finest Parisian patisseries. They come flavored with saffron, rosewater, pistachio, honey and more delicious flavors we love. \nAccording to Naomi Duguid’s Taste Of Persia , Iranians eat sweets often as a break in the day with tea or coffee, rather than at the end of a meal. And believe us when we say that you will want to take a break with all of these desserts. Take a look for yourself. \nHere are seven of our favorite Iranian desserts: 1 Bamieh (Persian Doughnuts With Saffron And Rose Water) Little Ferarro Kitchen Bamieh are pieces of syrup-soaked fried dough. They are crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside -- and fragrant thanks to the rosewater- and saffron-infused syrup. 2 Faloodeh (Rosewater And Lime Noodle Sorbet) Maman's Kitchen According to Louisa Shafia, author of The New Persian Kitchen , Faloodeh is one of the earliest known frozen desserts, dating back to 400 BCE. Faloodeh is essentially a noodle sorbet. It is made with cooked vermicelli noodles and a sugar-sweetened frozen syrup that's often spiked with sour flavors like lime or cherry. It is addictively chewy.

Its texture and flavor vary depending not only on the region of Iran from which they hail, but also on the origin of the recipe that was handed down. One thing that remains consistent is that koloocheh are a special treat that often accompany celebrations and holidays.

Not only is it flavored with saffron and rosewater, but it's decorated with cinnamon, almonds and pistachios, too. 7 Bastani (Persian Saffron Ice Cream) Food52 Saffron gives this Iranian ice cream an earthy flavor, the rosewater lends a hint of floral and the pistachios give it a wonderful crunch.
