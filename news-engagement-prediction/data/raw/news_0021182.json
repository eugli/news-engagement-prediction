In contrast, 33 percent disapproved of the sanctuary cities de-funding and 38 percent disapproved of the immigration ban.\nThe poll also examined the respondents' approval or disapproval to Trump’s nine other executive orders, including on federal government spending freezes (54 percent approve), delays or ignoring parts of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare (49 percent) and fast-tracking the construction of the highly controversial and much disputed Keystone XL pipeline.\nAll told, Trump scored no lower than a 46 percent approval for any of the orders. His long-running campaign promise to build a border wall to hinder Mexican immigrants received 48 percent approval and his withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal garnered 47 percent approval.\nHowever, Morning Consult/Politico did point out that Trump’s overall job approval rating continues to trend downward. Gallup’s most recent results – taken between Jan. 30 and Feb. 5 - show only 43 percent of Americans approve of the work Trump’s done and his highest mark has only been 46 percent, three days after his inauguration last month.\nTrump spoke Wednesday at a law enforcement conference in Washington and praised the immigration ban, claiming it makes Americans safer.\n“It’s sad, I think it’s a sad day. I think our security is at risk today. And it will be at risk until such time as we are entitled and get what we are entitled to as citizens of this country,” Trump said. “It was done for the security of our nation. The security of our citizens. So that people come in who aren’t going to do us harm. And that’s why it was done. And it couldn’t have been written any more precisely. It’s not like, ‘Oh gee, we wish it were written better.’ It’s written beautifully.”\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.ibtimes.com/", "http://www.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx", "http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/trump-responds-travel-ban-law-enforcement-speech-234787", "https://ibtimes.slack.com/messages/breakingnews/details/"], "published": "2017-02-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:39:55.633+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
