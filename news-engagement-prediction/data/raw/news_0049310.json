A retired lorry driver, who spends days taking photos of the artist painting from a cherry-picker, has even become a something of a local celebrity himself.

Locals commissioned the project after a similar artwork by Mr van was Helten was credited with boosting visitors to Brim, a dwindling farming town in Victoria. \n\"It was probably one of my most uplifting projects because I could directly see that what I had done has made some sort of difference and I didn't expect that at all,\" Mr van Helten told the BBC. \nThe Brisbane-based artist says his work is primarily about places and spaces. He typically arrives in the cities where he works with no preconceived ideas and embeds himself in local communities as part of his process. \n\"There's a bit of a global movement that recognises the value of mural art as tool for regeneration,\" he said. \nHe has plans to travel next to Raukkan an Aboriginal community in South Australia, followed by Dubai and Nashville. \n\"I'm not getting invites from New York,\" he said. \n\"The offers comes from the forgotten about places or the places that want to try new things or use their infrastructure in a creative way.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:08:08.696+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
