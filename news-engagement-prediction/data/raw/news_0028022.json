Sleep deprivation can interfere with the process that helps reinforce our memories, a new study has found. \nAfter studying mice, researchers at Johns Hopkins University in the US have fortified evidence that a key purpose of sleep is to recalibrate the brain cells responsible for learning and memory so the animals can ‘solidify’ lessons learned and use them when they awaken. \nThe researchers also report they have discovered several important molecules that govern the recalibration process, as well as evidence that sleep deprivation, sleep disorders and sleeping pills can interfere with the process. Researchers found evidence that sleep deprivation, sleep disorders and sleeping pills can interfere with the process of forming memories.

One possible reason that neurons do not usually max out is a process that has been well-studied in lab-grown neurons but not in living animals, asleep or awake. \nKnown as homeostatic scaling down, it is a process that uniformly weakens synapses in a neural network by a small percentage, leaving their relative strengths intact and allowing learning and memory formation to continue.
