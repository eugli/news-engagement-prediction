The ticket hall and passageways have also received a fresh paint job to create a more “welcoming” environment. \nMark Wild, Managing Director of London Underground, said: “I would like to thank customers and local businesses for their patience throughout the lift replacement work, which we have carried out as swiftly as possible. The re-opening of the station with more reliable new lifts will improve transport connections in the area, benefitting local people, businesses and visitors alike.” TfL reveals plans for major Bakerloo line extension \nDuring the closure, travellers were forced to walk to nearby stations including Waterloo, Elephant & Castle, and Southwark, or travel by bus. \nTfL claimed that by closing the station completely workers were able to carry out the lift replacements in half the time. \nBen Stephenson, Chief Executive of the WeAreWaterloo Business Improvement District, said: “We are very glad to see these works completed on schedule and would urge everyone to support the many local businesses in the area.” \nThe re-opening has also been welcomed by the Imperial War Museum, located five minutes’ walk from Lambeth North. \nA spokesman for the museum said: “The re-opening of Lambeth North is well-timed, as IWM welcomes visitors to mark its Centenary in early March.\" More about: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T14:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T09:09:50.812+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
