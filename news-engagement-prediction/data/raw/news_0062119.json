The chairman spoke to him this afternoon and Wayne offered his resignation.\"\n\"I'm devastated, the chairman is devastated. I have spoken to Wayne and the guy is in tears, crying down the phone. It is a very sad situation.\"\nWatch | Sutton United goalkeeper Wayne Shaw's pie stunt 00:34 S haw became something of an internet sensation when he was pictured eating a pie in the 83rd minute of the game on Monday evening which was shown live on television. However before the tie a bookmaker had offered odds of 8-1 that Shaw would eat a pie on camera during the match and adverts were carried in a newspaper sponsoring non-league Sutton.\nAn FA spokesperson confirmed: “We are investigating to establish whether there has been any breach of The FA rules relating to betting.”\nThe Gambling Commission, which licenses and regulates gambling in Britain, says it is also looking into whether there was any \"irregularity in the betting market and establishing whether the operator has met its licence requirement to conduct its business with integrity\". It warned operators (betting companies) in June last year about the integrity of taking bets on novelty markets.\nShaw eats the pie with his team 2-0 down Credit: BBC “Integrity in sport is not a joke and we have opened an investigation to establish exactly what happened,\" said enforcement and intelligence director Richard Watson.\nS un Bets, who sponsored Sutton for the fifth-round tie, tweeted that it had paid out a \"five-figure sum\" on the bet while Shaw admitted he was told of the betting promotion before the game.\n\"I thought I would give them a bit of banter and let's do it,\" he added. \"All the subs were on and we were 2-0 down…It was just a bit of banter for them. It is something to make the occasion as well and you can look back and say it was part of it and we got our ticket money back.\"\nSutton chairman Bruce Elliott said the fame went to Shaw's head Credit: Reuters H owever such comments are unlikely to be brushed aside with Sutton club chairman Bruce Elliott saying of the 23-stone player, who has been labelled the “roly-poly goalie” in the publicity surrounding the high-profile tie, that “he has got himself in the papers again and the fame obviously has gone to his head a little bit, but we will soon bring him back down to earth, don't worry about that”. Elliott said he knew nothing about the stunt.\nAlthough it was deemed humorous and harmless in some quarters the incident cannot simply be dismissed. A worldwide ban on betting in football was introduced in 2014 and covers everyone involved in the game, from the players and managers to the match officials and club staff.\nIt prevents participants covered by the ban from betting, either directly or indirectly, on any football match or competition, including the passing of \"inside information\".\nThe FA website refers defines that as \"information that you are aware of due to your position in the game and which is not publicly available\". It adds: \"You are not allowed to pass inside information on to someone else which they use for betting.\"\nWatch | Sutton United v Arsenal - key match stats 01:02 S utton made £1 million from their impressive cup run, which will be ploughed back into the club and improve its facilities, along with a £50,000 donation from Arsenal to build two new classrooms, while the Premier League club’s reward is a quarter-final draw at home to another non-league side Lincoln City .\nAlex Oxlade-Chamberlain admitted that after the 5-1 humiliation away to Bayern Munich in last week’s Champions League last-16 first leg Arsenal needed to bounce back to winning ways.\n“I think the only thing you can do after a really disappointing result is to get a win,” Oxlade-Chamberlain said. “We did that, we came here, we had a job to do and we did the job.\n\"We’re into the next round of the cup, that’s all that matters.”\nHowever the midfielder, who came on as a half-time substitute, said he also enjoyed the occasion: “The win was the crucial thing. But the night was something I don’t think certain players have seen in England. I don’t think Alexis (Sanchez) has experienced a game like that, in a place like this and everyone was looking forward to it.\n\"It’s different to what we’re used to, another challenge to get our heads round and Sutton made it really tough for us and competitive and I’ve got to give them full credit for the way they played.\n\"But the win was the only thing that mattered and we got that.”\nThe fastest players to 100 Arsenal goals", "external_links": ["http://17909.cdx.c.ooyala.com/lnZGd3OTE6JPPFfpWlcvmdoqGndidvMl/promo311940196", "http://17909.cdx.c.ooyala.com/NwaDN3OTE6HVwUL8SYaAb34LokOjV8o7/promo311898259"], "published": "2017-02-22T12:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T13:08:52.337+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
