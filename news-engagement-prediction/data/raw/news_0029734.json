I'm not going to get into all of them, but rest assured, the vast majority would fall into the \"common sense\" category. Earlier tonight at the Grammy Awards, Adele broke arguably the most important one: there are no re-dos. At least that's the rule for everyone else, but apparently not the beloved songstress. Because when Adele shocked everyone by asking for a mulligan midway through her tribute song to George Michael, she somehow came out looking even better. \nCheck out the video below. The moment in question happens around the one minute mark... Watch Adele's tribute to George Michael in full here: pic.twitter.com/LmsfYFKMaG â€” Adele Daily (@AdeleDailyInfo) February 13, 2017 \nThe mishap in question Adele referenced during her performance happened last year. The singer dropped her microphone during her number, and she was not a happy camper about it. As such, she obviously felt additional pressure this year, especially since on top of wanting to bounce back, she was paying tribute to the dearly departed George Michael . Fortunately, she absolutely rocked it after the questionable start. \nHere's what she said after she stopped the music... \n\"I know it's live TV. I can't do it again like last year. I'm sorry for swearing and I'm sorry for starting again. Can we please start it again? I'm sorry, I can't mess this up for him. I'm sorry. I can't.\" \nIn case you didn't catch the end of the performance (the above video is six minutes), it concluded with Adele getting a standing ovation, which is probably the second most Adele thing that's ever happened. As many sports legends can attest to, nothing fixes mistakes quite like an almost unfair level of talent.
