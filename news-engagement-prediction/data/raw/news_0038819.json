Former detective Goncalo Amaral holds a copy of his book, \"Maddie:The Truth about the Lie\" (Photo: AFP) \nIn the 76-page ruling, the Supreme Court also said the archiving in 2008 of the criminal case into Madeleine’s ­disappearance does not prove the McCanns are innocent. The court concluded Amaral’s book was not a personal and unjustified attack on the McCanns. It was an “opinion” based on the case files. \nThere was no defamatory intention behind it and so it is protected by “freedom of speech rights”. That ruling left Madeleine’s parents facing legal costs and the nightmare prospect of being sued by the former detective. \nLocal reports yesterday said the couple were seeking to get the decision thrown out after launching a formal complaint against the judges’ findings.

The latest ruling means Amaral was spared having to pay the McCanns compensation he was ordered to hand over two years ago over his book The Truth of the Lie. \nAccording to the latest accounts filed last month the couple’s Find Madeleine fund has just £200,000 left after half a million was placed in investments. \nExperts say legal fees and a possible pay-out to Amaral would easily dwarf this sum, leaving no cash left to continue the couple’s efforts to find their daughter.

A local who spotted Amaral dining told the Sunday People: “He rarely mentions it. We know who he is – everybody does.” \nA shopkeeper added: “He comes to the newsagents and then goes to one of the restaurants here for lunch.” \nRoadsweeper Enrique Gonzalez said: “It is popular with all of the police officers who live and work around here. \n“He comes and talks about the old times.” \nThe McCanns’ spokesman Clarence Mitchell said: “If Mr Amaral’s current book about Madeleine or any new one he may be planning to write is published here in the UK Kate and Gerry’s lawyers will take immediate action. He needs to know lawyers are watching.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T01:24:22.103+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
