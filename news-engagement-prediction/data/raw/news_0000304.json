After Namco was merged with another Japanese games firm, Bandai, to form Namco-Bandai (later Bandai Namco) in 2005, Nakamura retained an honorary position. He was also awarded the Order of the Rising Sun by the Japanese government for his services to industry. \nWATCH: Brief history of arcade game PAC-MAN \nPac-Man, conceived to look like a pizza with a slice taken out of it, was invented by Toru Iwatani and went on sale as a coin-operated game in 1980. It expanded onto consoles before spawning massive merchandise sales, TV series, theme parks and a film. \nNamco bought Nikkatsu in 1993. Japan’s oldest film studio was once famous for its pink-eiga, the free-ranging soft porn genre that gave many contemporary Japanese filmmakers their career start. Nakamura is credited as executive producer on several of its titles (“Warm Water Under a Red Bridge,”“A Stranger of Mine”.) He was also executive producer on Crystal Sky’s 2010 game adaptation “Tekken.” \nJapan’s “Father of PAC-MAN” arcade game, Masaya Nakamura, has died at age 91.
