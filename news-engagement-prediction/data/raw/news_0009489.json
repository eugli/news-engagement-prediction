Photo by Robert Cohen, rcohen@post-dispatch.com \nST. LOUIS • The Board of Aldermen on Friday approved a sweeping ban on the use of smokeless tobacco products at all city sports venues from high school to the pros, including Busch Stadium \nThe all-inclusive ban prohibits fans and players alike from using chewing tobacco, dip or snuff while inside the facility. \nFriday’s action makes St. Louis the 13th city to pass such a prohibition. The new law essentially cleans up a loophole not covered in the last Collective Bargaining Agreement negotiated between Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association. \nThe agreement, which was finalized late last year, banned smokeless tobacco for new major league players going forward. \nThe ban, however, does not apply to existing players, meaning any player with just one game under his belt is exempt. But Major League Baseball and the player’s union have encouraged players not to use tobacco products at ballparks. Tobacco use has been banned at minor league facilities. \nDionne Flowers, the city’s 2nd Ward Alderman, sponsored the bill . She said she was approached by the American Heart Association and the American Stroke Association about moving the ban forward. \n“This is actually something that MLB wants, especially after the passing of Tony Gwynn,” Flowers said. “For us, we want to send a message that smokeless tobacco is not healthy. We want to change the perception, especially for young people.” \nWhile it will be difficult to enforce, the law carries minimum penalties of $100 for first offenses and $250 for second offenses. Any subsequent offense is punishable by a minimum of $500. \nThe bill was one of roughly 30 pieces of legislation the Board of Aldermen approved unanimously in a single vote Friday without discussion. \nMayor Francis Slay is expected to sign the bill once it reaches his desk.
