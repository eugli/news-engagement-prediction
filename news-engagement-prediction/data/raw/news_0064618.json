The gap was very wide five years ago. The company’s aim is to be the number 1 in KTM’s global sales. Bajaj Auto owns about 47% in KTM. \n\n“India’s role is set to grow for KTM. With the revamping of the entire line-up and the addition of Duke 250, we are eyeing a strong double digit growth this year too,” said Nandi. The Duke 250’s entry — part of KTM’s global portfolio — into India has been timed well to take on the new competition from TVS-BMW, which is set to hit the market in the second half of 2017. \n\nKTM has been one of the fastest growing two-wheeler brands in India with a compounded annual growth rate of 48% in past five years, and is expected to do well this year too.
