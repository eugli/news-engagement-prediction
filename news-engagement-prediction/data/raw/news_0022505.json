Fifty Shades Darker, which stars Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan, was released in UK cinemas on Friday night and is the sequel to the first and hugely popular film. But a message informing men that they could not come in to watch the film was recorded by a staff member at the Diamond Cinema in Navan, Ireland.
