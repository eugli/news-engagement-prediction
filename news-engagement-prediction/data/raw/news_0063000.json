Till recently, funds transfers from banks were in the same position; apart from the account details of the person to whom the funds had to be transferred, you needed to have the IFSC code of the bank branch where the account was located. That’s what UPI from National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) fixed since, once your Aadhaar number was linked to a bank account, neither the IFSC code nor the bank account details were required—these were embedded in the system, all a sender needed was your name or even a pseudonym or your mobile number. Having developed UPI, NPCI took this a step further and created AadhaarPay on its BHIM app, to cater to the bulk of India’s population that may want to do digital payments but doesn’t have a phone or a smart phone. In this case, the merchant has a fingerprint scanner that costs Rs 2,000 or so attached to the headphone jack of his phone that does the job. Once a transaction is to be paid for, the consumer simply puts a finger on the scanner, this sends an authentication signal to a bank account which is linked to an Aadhaar number, and the bank releases the fund to the merchant’s account.\nYou May Also Want To Watch:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T12:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T08:30:12.991+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
