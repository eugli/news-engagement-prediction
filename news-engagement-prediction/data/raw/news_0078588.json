Was Denzel [Washington] really that good? Or was it just because they needed a black guy that people knew to nominate to make sure that the controversy from last year was extinguished.'” \nDavis did, of course, go on to win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her role alongside actor Denzel Washington in the movie “Fences.” In fact, as the Los Angeles Times pointed out , Sunday night’s award ceremony was a record-breaking night for African Americans in Hollywood. \nActor Mahershala Ali took home the award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in “Moonlight,” which went on to win the Oscar for Best Picture. And Ezra Edelman, who is biracial, won the Best Documentary award for “O.J. Simpson: Made in America.” \nZiegler, who said it is “not irrational” now to ask why an African-American star is given an award, said having to wonder such a thing “is wrong.” \n“It has the exact opposite result than what would be, theoretically, intended by the original controversy,” he concluded.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:06:48.099+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
