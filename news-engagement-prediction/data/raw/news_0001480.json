The latest example is this recently opened \"cycleway\" in Xiamen , a nearly 5-mile-long stretch of road connecting cyclists to all five of the cities residential areas.   Built by Xiamen City Public Bicycle Management, the company says the path allows for 2,023 bicycles at a time with a top speed of 15 miles per hour. The bike path also acts as a highway of sorts with 11 exits that connect to 11 bus stations and two subway stations. It serves as connective tissue that helps connect people to the main arteries of the city's public transportation network.

This first cycleway is a test run for possible future bike path installations. But according to Xinhua , China's state-sponsored news agency, local residents are already enjoying the ride.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T23:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:47:17.129+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
