But even though the way the award was handed to Moonlight by the heroically calm producers of La La Land was unorthodox, what followed next was pretty standard. Jimmy Kimmel , the host, came out and said a few (in this case, apologetic) words and bid the TV audience goodnight. But that’s not how Kimmel’s sure-to-be-memorable-anyway hosting stint was supposed to end. Remember, this is a host who broke tradition by enlisting Justin Timberlake to kick things off on a high note, would we be that surprised if he had recruited another A-lister to close out the night? From what we hear, the late-night comedian intended to leave the viewers with one last acrimonious Matt Damon encounter. Kimmel and Damon’s nine-year joke feud (which was originally kickstarted, it should be remembered, by Kimmel’s ex-girlfriend Sarah Silverman ) was one of the most enjoyable repeating gags in recent Oscar memory. A bit that could have easily and quickly worn thin, Kimmel’s repeated jabs at Damon worked so well because both men have been honing their fake hostility for nearly a decade. But Kimmel’s attack on Damon’s We Bought a Zoo and mock attempt to play the actor off the stage as he and Ben Affleck presented the best original screenplay award were supposed to be followed up by a concluding sketch. Salma Hayek , who was backstage as a presenter, told Vanity Fair’s Michelle Collins that the pair had one more bit in store. It could potentially have been a call back to when Damon heckled Kimmel for losing the Emmy last September. This time it would be Damon, a producer on best picture long shot Manchester by the Sea , who would have been the loser if either frontrunner La La Land or Moonlight took the top prize. (As it turns out, they both did?) Damon was overheard at the Vanity Fair Oscar party admitting that he “was going to come out and do an interview and that is how [Kimmel] was going to end.” Sadly, that bit will forever be lost to the ash heap of history. Instead we’ll have to settle for Kimmel unfairly blaming Warren Beatty for the biggest confusion in Oscar history instead. That’s a real opportunity missed—he could have blamed Matt Damon.
