Now, I don’t have the right to resign?” he retorted. \nSim was commenting on DAP secretary-general Lim Guan Eng's  statement that the resignation is an act of disloyalty although the Malacca opposition stalwart had denied it. \nOn Sunday, Sim together with three Malacca assemblymen - Goh Leong San (Duyong), Lim Jak Wong (Bachang) and Chin Choon Seong (Kesidang) resigned from the party after 12 years of bitter relations between them and another faction in the state DAP as well as the national leadership.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T16:02:13.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
