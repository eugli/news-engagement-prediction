Robbie Williams ‘gives up Brits dressing room’ to The 1975’s 100-piece choir \nThe man who David Attenborough called ‘a born communicator’ — and who was called a ‘modern-day Noah’ by the CEO of RSPCA Queensland — died in 2006 after being stabbed by a stingray. \nIt came as a sad blow to the dual worlds of wildlife conservation and TV entertainment, but his spirit lives on in his enthusiastic children Bindi, 18, and Robert, 16, who are carrying on his animal-championing legacy. \nWhile we can’t bake him a cake shaped like a crocodile (his favourite animal), we can celebrate his passion and sense of fun, so here are some the greatest things he ever came out with… 1. ‘Crocodiles are easy. They try to kill and eat you. People are harder. Sometimes they pretend to be your friend first.’ \n2. ‘When I talk to the camera, mate, it’s not like I’m talking to the camera, I’m talking to you because I want to whip you around and plunk you right there with me.’ 3. ‘The only animals I’m not comfortable with are parrots, but I’m learning as I go. I’m getting better and better at ’em. I really am.’ \n4. ‘Inside the house was just snakesville. Crikey, mate, it was chockablock full of snakes.’ On his childhood home, populated by animals Steve loved animals more than anyone could reasonably expect (Picture: Australia Zoo via Getty Images) 5. ‘I have no fear of losing my life. If I have to save a koala or a crocodile or a kangaroo or a snake, mate, I will save it.’ \n6. ‘Yeah, I’m a thrill seeker, but crikey, education’s the most important thing.’ 7. ‘They’re not short! They’re normal shorts. I could get the short shorts out of the closet.’ On his shorts \n8. ‘Her karma helps my karma. Together, we’re not stressed. We’re pretty passive, pretty laid-back.’ On his rhinoceros iguana, Rebecca 9. ‘[Bindi] had a front tooth hanging off with a bit of meat and blood there and she said “Daddy can you get this off?”. So I got the long-nosed pliers and went in there.’ \n10. ‘There are 23 species of crocodile. Seventeen of those species are rare or endangered. They’re on the way out, no matter what anyone does or says, you know.’ 11. ‘We don’t own the planet Earth, we belong to it. And we must share it with our wildlife.’ \n12. ‘I was in complete control of the crocodile. Robert was tucked right in my arm.’ After carrying his one-month-old son to a crocodile feeding Generated by IJG JPEG Library ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T15:07:19.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
