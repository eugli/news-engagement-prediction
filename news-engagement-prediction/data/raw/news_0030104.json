Photo: AP \nApple customers are the most devoted in Australia, with 33 per cent of respondents preferring to stick with an iPhone for their next smartphone upgrade, while 21 per cent will remain loyal to Samsung. Loyalty to other individual smartphone brands — such as Sony, HTC, Google and Microsoft — remains at less than 2 per cent each. \nThe Samsung Note 7 recall, due to exploding batteries, saw the number of Australians intending to buy a Samsung device fall to 21 per cent from a high of 33 per cent. The majority of those people who lost interest in buying a Samsung device would still prefer to stick with Android rather than defect to Apple's iPhone — with interest in Huawei, Oppo and Google-branded Android phones increasing by more than 50 per cent. Related Content Speculation mounting over 'iPhone X' \nThose figures leave 36 per cent of Australians not professing a loyalty to any particular brand or mobile operating system. Baby Boomers are the least loyal smartphone owners, according to finder.com.au, with more than half buying whichever phone they prefer at the time of purchase. \nOverall Australian men are less loyal to smartphone brands than women, with men opting to purchase a new phone based on preference of features rather than brand loyalty. Of the Australians who do prefer to stick with the same brand, women are much more loyal to Apple than men (38 per cent as opposed to 23 per cent), while men are slightly more loyal to Samsung than women (22 per cent to 20 per cent). Advertisement \nThe fact so many Australians are open to changing their brand of smartphone creates a significant opportunity for challenger brands to get a foothold in 2017, says finder.com.au telco editor Alex Kidman. \n\"The figures suggest that there are still rusted on phone buyers who won't switch brands but, just like with elections, there are plenty of swinging voters,\" Kidman says. \"This creates opportunities for either Samsung or Apple to poach users from each other, or perhaps for a new power to rise and seriously grow its presence in Australia.\" SHARE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T08:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:02:03.109+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
