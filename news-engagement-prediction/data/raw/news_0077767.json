The case was variously dubbed the Persons Unknown trial or the Anarchists trial - we were all voluble if unsophisticated young enemies of the state, all states. \n“We also had absolutely nothing to do with any explosions. After several months in custody, this charge was dropped and a different conspiracy charge preferred. Opening the Crown's case at the Old Bailey a year later, the prosecutor said we had conspired 'to overthrow society'. The jury acquitted us on all counts.” Bennett was wrongly convicted for the murder of a policeman in 1974.

He went on to attain a PhD in the field and has campaigned against miscarriages of justice over the years. \nBennett again made headlines in 1987 when Jeremy Corbyn appointed him parliamentary researcher, in a move deemed controversial at the time and raised questions about security clearance in the House of Commons, according to BBC. \nHe most recently wrote the scripts for upcoming BBC drama series Gunpowder, starring Game of Thrones’ Kit Harrington. It tells the story of British activist Guy Fawkes and the plot to blow up the House of Lords in the 17th century.
