Felipe Gallegos said Friday. \nGallegos said some suspects act as lookouts and others use objects to block store cameras while the prime suspects, usually female, bring babies in carts to the formula section and load cans of the product into diaper bags. \nRESTAURANT SHOOTING: Man kills wife, himself in Pasadena \nThe Garth Road Walmart has been hit seven times, Gallegos said, adding he thinks the suspects may have branched out to stores in other cities. \n\"I'm pretty sure it's going on all over,\" he said. Walmart and the Baytown police shared images of the suspects with other stores and law enforcement agencies around the Houston area. \nGallegos said the Baytown Walmart has also designated specific employees to keep an eye on the baby section of the store and report suspicious activity to police. \nIn total, more than $3,000 in formula has been stolen from the store on Garth Road. Gallegos said the suspects steal the formula, then sell it online for a cheaper price than the store. \n\"There's a big black market for that,\" he said. If caught, the suspects will be charged with organized criminal activity. \nAnyone with information on this case is asked to call Baytown Crime Stoppers at 281-427-TIPS or the Baytown PD Detective Division at 281-420-6646.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T07:32:05.336+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
