He splits his summer among his delinquent friend circle, a prospective girlfriend, and the older men he meets online. \nThe trailer features Frankie posing shirtless for pictures in the mirror, the intimate scene reflective of his warring desires. \nCritics at Sundance praised Beach Rats for its “captivating,”“astonishing,” and “haunting” tale, while Hittman won the festival’s Directing Award for U.S. Drama . \nThe film, also starring Madeline Weinstein and Kate Hodge, will be released sometime in the fall by Neon, the distribution company founded by RADiUS’ Tom Quinn and Alamo Drafthouse’s Tim League. Also announced on Wednesday via press release, Neon picked up the North American rights to Racer and the Jailbird from director Michaël R. Roskam ( Bullhead ). \nIncluding Beach Rats , Roxanne Roxanne , Ingrid Goes West , and its debut film Colossal , this makes for Neon’s fifth acquisition.
