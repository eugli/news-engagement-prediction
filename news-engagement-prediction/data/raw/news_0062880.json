It's a lovely place, cheerful with vacationing families and bustling with events beyond the typical February mundanities at most club's camps: Last week, the complex hosted a fastpitch softball showcase for teenagers, an international baton-twirling competition, a soccer tournament and a gymnastics event. \nBut two of the Braves' nearest neighbors of recent seasons, the Astros and the Nationals, opened a new facility in West Palm Beach, Fla., this season. The Astros trained in nearby Kissimmee since 1984, and the franchise now known as the Nationals made their spring home in Viera, Fla. - about an hour east of Braves camp - since 2003, when they were still the Montreal Expos. \nTheir flight puts the Braves in a bit of a pickle, at least until if and when the Atlanta club moves to a proposed new facility in Sarasota in 2019 . \nFor now, the club's shortest spring road trips will be to face the Tigers in Lakeland, about a 40-minute bus ride without traffic - no safe bet. Lake Buena Vista is less than 75 miles from the Yankees' spring home in Tampa, but driving in the Tampa area is a Kafkaesque nightmare wherein all left turns feel like an extreme sport. Trips to visit the Phillies in Clearwater and the Blue Jays in Dunedin require traveling across or around Tampa Bay, which risks - trust me on this one - sitting parked in congestion on a causeway while the shirtless bro in the next lane unironically pumps Vanilla Ice music with all his windows open. \nRoad games against the Mets in Port St. Lucie necessitate two hours on the bus, and the Cardinals, Marlins, Nats and Astros all now train another half hour south of the Mets. The 140-mile trek to play the Red Sox or Twins in Fort Myers? Godspeed, Atlanta Braves. \n\"It'll be interesting,\" Braves catcher Anthony Recker told USA TODAY Sports last week. \"No one's going to be volunteering for some of the trips, I'm sure. But you want to play some gamesâ€¦. It's different. It can wear you out a little bit.\" \n\"I just have to be aware of not wearing these guys out with the travel,\" said manager Brian Snitker. \"Getting back late, and we get up early. So all you're ready to do is eat and go to bed, then you get up and all of a sudden we're doing it again - on the bus, traveling. It's tough.\" \nRemember: Teams don't play series in spring training, just one game at a time in every road park. And it's rare for a club to put up at a hotel overnight during the Grapefruit League schedule. Most traveling Braves players, on most road trips, will spend between three and six hours on the team bus on days they're also expected to play baseball games. \nVeteran ballplayers rarely make long spring training trips. Players certain to get a roster spot are rarely eager to put their bodies through interminable rides on cramped buses before a season in which they will play 162 games in 189 days. \nIt's unlikely a big enough factor to make or break the 2017 Braves, but it's undoubtedly a disadvantage: Braves veterans will enter the regular season with little practice against elite Major Leaguers, since few if any elite Major League opponents will ever make the trip to Lake Buena Vista. And the amount of time the club and its coaches will spend traveling mean less time to iron out fundamentals in camp. \n\"It's a definite obstacle, with the schedule like it is, and the travel we have to do,\" Snitker said. \"I told (Braves coach Ron Washington) the other day, 'There may be a day you have to stay back here with your guys, to get your work in.' Because we spend so much time on the bus. I want those guys, our coaches, to get their hands on the players, and we may have to adjust like that. It's tough, and we're going to have to get through it.\" \nThe Astros and Nationals, previously the Braves' partners in isolation, will now get to experience the rare joy of road spring training games requiring no travel whatsoever, since they share a stadium. And the new spot in West Palm Beach puts them significantly closer to the Cardinals, Marlins and Mets. Astros manager A.J. Hinch, asked about the new traveling schedule, griped only about the road trips his club will make to play the Braves. \n\"They stuck two games for us in Orlando, so they wanted to remind us you still have to travel in spring,\" Hinch said. \"But it's nice to look forward to a road game being three exits to the north - we've got a couple road games against the Marlins and the Cardinals. For coaches, for players, for the continuity of playing time, I don't have to worry a lot about three-hour bus rides or car rides for our players when we're mapping out how to prepare them for the season.\" \nFor Cactus League teams in Arizona, no trip extends beyond Phoenix's suburban sprawl. The longest possible bus ride, from where the Athletics practice in Mesa to the Royals and Padres' facility in Surprise, takes less than an hour. So the Braves' shortest trips - their three road games in Tiger Town - will require about as much travel as the lengthiest Cactus League journey. In the amount of time it will take the Braves to get to Fort Myers, the A's could likely drive to and from Surprise three times. \n\"Arizona's definitely nice,\" said Recker, who spent his first six pro seasons in the Oakland A's organization. \n\"Everybody knows the difference between Arizona and here,\" said Braves pitcher Josh Collmenter, a former Diamondback. \"It'll be a little different, but you adjust.\" \nThe Braves' Grapefruit League schedule opens with back-to-back home games on Saturday and Sunday, then a relatively short trip to Lakeland on Monday and another home game Tuesday. But in the first five days of March alone, Braves players will trek a total of about 950 total miles on round-trip rides to Tampa, Clearwater, Jupiter and Fort Myers, or nearly twice as many miles as the Milwaukee Brewers - to choose one centrally located Cactus League team - will travel all spring.
