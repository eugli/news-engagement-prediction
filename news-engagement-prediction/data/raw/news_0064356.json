(Jonathon Berlin/Chicago Tribune) See more videos \nThe seven slayings marked Chicago's single deadliest day since last Christmas Day. Most of the shootings took place in the South Side in neighborhoods such as Brainerd, West Pullman, Bronzeville and the Altgeld Gardens housing complex. \nAmong the victims was a 60-year-old grandfather who was killed early Wednesday morning outside his Little Village home on Chicago's Southwest Side as he prepared to go to work at his die casting job. \nJones and Bingham were shot about 8:15 p.m. in the 7600 block of South Champlain Avenue. Bingham had been shot in the neck while sitting in the driver's seat of a parked car, while Jones was close by on a sidewalk with wounds to the abdomen and side, police said. Both were pronounced dead at Stroger Hospital. \nAnthony Guglielmi, the chief police spokesman, said investigators believe both victims were targeted, possibly because of a conflict that Bingham was involved in. Police found a gun hidden in the car, Guglielmi said. No arrests have been made. \nGuglielmi said Bingham was a documented gang member who had made the department's strategic subject list -- a list of about 1,400 people considered most likely to shoot someone or become a victim of violence. It is compiled through a computerized algorithm and includes myriad factors, including individuals' criminal history, especially any weapons offenses or crimes of violence; their age at their first arrest; whether the nature of their arrests escalated over the years; if they had been the intended targets of shootings or the victims of violence; and if those they've been arrested with had themselves been shot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T08:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:51:16.871+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
