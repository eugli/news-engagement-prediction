Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut first relayed Gorsuch’s remarks on Wednesday following a meeting with the judge. Trump’s own confirmation team for Gorsuch later confirmed he had made those remarks.\nBut Trump suggested that Blumenthal had misrepresented Gorsuch, tweeting early Thursday, “Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who never fought in Vietnam when he said for years he had (major lie), now misrepresents what Judge Gorsuch told him?”\nArticle Continued Below Blumenthal faced criticism in the past for saying he had served in Vietnam. Blumenthal served in the Marine Corps Reserves during Vietnam. He apologized in 2010, saying he regretted his misstatements.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for clarity on how Gorsuch’s comments were misrepresented.\nGorsuch’s comments came at the end of a week of meetings with members of the Senate, which is considering his nomination. His response may have been aimed at drawing a line of separation from the new president, who has been a politically polarizing figure among Democrats in a highly charged partisan fight over the court.\nRead more: \nTrump says court hearings over his travel ban are ‘disgraceful’ \nTrump’s travel ban faces its biggest legal test yet \nCanada needs to act now to help refugees and minorities harmed by Trump’s orders \nPrior to the judge’s meeting with Blumenthal, Trump criticized the court that is deliberating his immigration and refugee executive order, telling a group of police chiefs his immigration order was “done for the security of our nation.”\nHe quoted from the portion of the immigration law that he said gave him the power to enact the ban, calling it “beautifully written” and saying, “A bad high school student would understand this.”\n“Courts seem to be so political and it would be so great for our justice system if they would be able to read a statement and do what’s right,” he added. “And that has to do with the security of our country, which is so important.”\nThe 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is weighing the appeal of his executive order on immigration, including a temporary travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries. In a hearing Tuesday, judges on the appeals court challenged the administration’s claim that the ban was motivated by terrorism fears, but also questioned an attorney’s argument that it unconstitutionally targeted Muslims.\nSince a lower-court judge blocked the order last week, Trump has assailed the decision, leading legal experts, Democrats and some Republicans to question whether the president’s remarks might jeopardize the independence of the judiciary. Others have expressed fears he may be attempting to use political influence to sway the courts.\nBlumenthal, a former state attorney general, told reporters Wednesday he had told Gorsuch that he would need to publicly condemn Trump’s attacks on judicial independence.\n“It needs to be a strong condemnation and that kind of public condemnation is important to establish his independence,” Blumenthal said. “Otherwise, the American public will conclude that he is more likely to be a rubber stamp.”\nIn his speech, Trump sought to link his comments about the court battle over his executive order to the law enforcement community in attendance.\n“We have to allow you to do your job,” he said. “And we have to give you the weapons that you need, and this is a weapon that you need and they’re trying to take it away from you.”\nThe president has repeatedly said people are “pouring in” since the ban was put on hold and suggested that blocking the order would be dangerous for U.S. citizens.\nOn Wednesday morning he tweeted, “Big increase in traffic into our country from certain areas, while our people are far more vulnerable, as we wait for what should be EASY D!”\nThe administration has not provided any information to support his claims.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T15:17:47.194+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
