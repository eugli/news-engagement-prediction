CHRIS MCKEEN / FAIRFAX NZ \nMorgan says New Zealand is \"obsessed\" with school assessments. \nWhile white, middle- and upper-class Kiwi kids had \"some of the best education outcomes in the world\", those on the margins of society were being left behind. \nREAD MORE: \n\"Some children, generally those from poorer backgrounds, come to school around two years behind, and most of those never catch up despite the best efforts of the education system.\" JOHN SELKIRK/FAIRFAX NZ \nMorgan's party would delay the use of National Standards and cut NCEA testing, allowing high school students to sit either level 1, 2, or 3 in their last year of school. \nWhile it was natural for parents and politicians to want to hold teachers and students to account through testing, Morgan said \"the evidence shows we are using up way too much precious learning time assessing our children. \n\"We are obsessed with assessing and ranking our children when test results can only show part of a child's development. \n\"Our obsession with ranking all our children takes up time and resource, and is counterproductive to helping them all find their strengths.\" \nAssessment scores were a questionable method to measure student learning and a \"downright awful\" indicator of school performance, Morgan said. Ad Feedback \nHis party would delay national standards until Year 6, instead of Year 1 as at present. \nIt would also slash NCEA testing for high school students, giving those in their final year of school the choice of sitting NCEA Level 1, 2 or 3. \n\"The extra time would be spent on learning and developing individual learning plans to ensure that students have the qualifications and skills they will need.\" \nMorgan said the party would also scrap the publishing of national standards and NCEA results, \"unless they can be translated into true 'added value' results\". \nMorgan said ECE needed to be more of a priority, as investing in children at an early age led to the best chance of success. \nThe Government's \"scattergun\" approach to funding ECE meant some families still struggled to find affordable childcare, he said. \n\"Over time, we would like to see high-quality, free, universal full-time ECE for children aged three years and over.\" \nThe party's education policy also included allowing schools in one region to merge administrative functions and save money, encouraging people to use their local school, and carrying out a review of the tertiary education sector. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T02:02:36.411+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
