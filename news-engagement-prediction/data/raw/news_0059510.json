They do not want to stay in France, they want to live in the UK Francois Hollande \"We have offered these children shelter and protection, but they do not want to stay in France, they want to live in the UK in order to be reunited with their loved ones.” Britain had promised to accept 3,000 migrant children, but later said it would only welcome 350 because cash-strapped councils had run out of space, straining relations between the two neighbours. Referring to the European Union’s Dublin agreement, which says a nation must take in migrants if they already have family there, Mr Hollande added: “Deals must be respected and the UK cannot shirk its responsibilities towards child refugees any longer.” Migrant 'children' from 'Jungle Camp' arrive in the UK Wed, October 19, 2016 Migrant 'children' from the 'Jungle Camp' in Calais arrive in the UK to be reunited with relatives. 1 of 26 GETTY The UK reduced the intake of migrant children to 350 because councils could not cope with numbers France and Britain have been bickering over who should be looking after the thousands of Britain-bound child refugees evacuated from the notorious Jungle migrant camp for months. In November, less than one month after the shanty town was reduced to ash and rubble, the Home Office was accused of breaking its promise to provide sanctuary to unaccompanied minors after it published new restrictive guidelines. The rules halted the transfer of thousands of isolated minors with family ties in Britain.
