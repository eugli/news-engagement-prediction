Key points: Democrats fear Mr Sessions will not protect minorities or women Republicans maintained Mr Sessions has a proven track record The vote came amid rising tensions over delays in Mr Trump's appointments \nThe 52-47 vote capped weeks of divisive battles over Mr Sessions as one of the Senate's most conservative politicians. \nDemocrats have cast Mr Sessions as too cosy with Mr Trump and too harsh on immigrants, asserting that he would not do enough to protect voting rights of minorities, protections for gays, and the legal right of women to obtain an abortion. \nMany also fear immigrants in the country illegally will not receive due process with Mr Session as the top law enforcement officer. \n\"Any Attorney-General must be able to stand firm for the rule of law even against the powerful executive that nominated him or her,\" Senator Tim Kaine said. \n\"In this administration I believe that independence is even more necessary. \n\"His [Sessions] record raises doubts about whether he can be a champion for those who need this office most and it also raises doubts about whether he can curb unlawful overreach\" by Mr Trump. External Link: Nancy Pelosi tweets on Jeff Sessions confirmation. \nBut Republicans maintained that Mr Sessions has demonstrated over a long career in public service and two decades in the Senate that he possesses integrity, honesty and is committed to justice. \n\"He's honest. He's fair. He's been a friend to many of us, on both sides of the aisle,\" Majority leader Mitch McConnell said. \n\"It's been tough to watch all this good man has been put through in recent weeks. This is a well-qualified colleague with a deep reverence for the law. He believes strongly in the equal application of it to everyone.\" \nMr Sessions won unanimous backing from Senate Republicans but picked up the support of just one Democrat, Joe Manchin of West Virginia. \nPresident Trump was quick to congratulate Mr Sessions' confirmation on Twitter. \nThe vote came amid rising tension between Republicans controlling the chamber over delaying tactics by minority Democratic that have left fewer of Mr Trump's picks in place than President Barack Obama had eight years ago. \nDemocrats no longer have filibuster power over Cabinet picks after changing Senate rules when they controlled the chamber in 2013. \nNext up for the Senate is Republican Tom Price, Mr Trump's pick for health secretary. \nA final vote on Mr Price could come late Thursday (local time) and success seemed certain. \nAP/Reuters First posted February 09, 2017 11:35:12 The Trump presidency", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T07:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T08:20:48.626+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
