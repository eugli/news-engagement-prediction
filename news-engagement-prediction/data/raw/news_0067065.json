The vaccine is part of the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) and MMRV (measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox) vaccines. \nMost children get the vaccine as part of their regular shots. \n“In Alberta, we recommend two doses of mumps-containing vaccine,” Alberta Health Services (AHS) medical officer of health Dr. Judy MacDonald said. \n“First dose given at 12 months of age and the second one just before starting school.” \nMacDonald said adults who haven’t been immunized can still get the vaccine. \n\nWhat causes mumps? \nThe illness is spread through spit contact, such as sharing food or drinks, or when an infected person coughs or sneezes near you. \nThe virus can spread seven days before and nine days after symptoms start. Mumps is most likely spread one or two days before and five days after symptoms start. \nMacDonald said athletes on sports teams are more susceptible to getting the virus. \n“For sports teams, we do try to get the message out repeatedly: use your own water bottle. Don’t be sharing spit because mumps is one disease that can be spread that way, amongst others.” \nWhat are the symptoms? Swelling and pain in the jaw Fever Headache, earache, sore throat, and pain when you swallow or open your mouth Tiredness, with aching in the muscles and joints Poor appetite and vomiting \nIt typically takes two to three weeks to get mumps’ symptoms after you’ve been exposed, although some people who are infected with the virus don’t get symptoms. \nHow is mumps diagnosed? \nMumps is usually diagnosed based on symptoms and a history of exposure to the illness. A blood test can also be performed to find out if a person has mumps. \nAdditionally, the virus can be identified using a sample of urine, saliva, or cerebrospinal fluid, but these tests are rare. \nHow is it treated? \nThe majority of people exposed to the virus simply require rest and care at home. \nIf you get mumps, take medicine to help relieve fever or headache as required, use ice or a heat pack on swollen areas, drink additional fluids to reduce fever and prevent dehydration, and suck on ice chips or flavoured ice pops and eat soft foods that don’t require chewing. \nIt’s recommended that people with mumps stay out of public places five to nine days after salivary glands first started to swell. \nWhat is it important to prevent mumps? \nVaccinating your child is important because mumps has the potential of causing serious problems and is a contagious disease that can cause outbreaks. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:40:56.491+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
