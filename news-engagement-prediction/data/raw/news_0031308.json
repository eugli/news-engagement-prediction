The initial roster had 799 players in it. \nThe list also includes 23 capped Indian players with only pacer Sudeep Tyagi, who has played four ODIs, missing from it. A notable name in the capped list is Cheteshwar Pujara with a base price of R 30 lakh. Pujara has often said he wants to play three formats even though he went unsold at last year’s auction. VIVO #IPL Player Auction 2017...Here are the sets & players listed for auction to be held on Feb 20th in Bengaluru https://t.co/xwhoUh9UPg pic.twitter.com/rloBeuwOPB — IndianPremierLeague (@IPL) February 14, 2017 \nA total of 11 players --- Eoin Morgan, Angelo Matthews, Benjamin Stokes, Pat Cummins, Mitchell Johnson, Ishant Sharma, Chris Woakes --- have Rs 2 crore as base price. Jonny Bairstow, Kyle Abbott, Trent Boult, Jason Holder, Brad Haddin and Nathan Lyon have a base price of Rs 1.5 crore. Alex Hales, Jason Roy, Corey Anderson, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Kagiso Rabada, Marlon Samuels, Dan Christian, Grant Elliot and Andile Phehlukwayo are in the base price bracket of Rs 1 crore. \nLast year’s big surprises have taken a huge knock in their base price after disappointing performances. Pawan Negi, who was sold to Delhi Daredevils for a record Rs 8.5 crore, is in the base price bracket of R 30 lakh. Murugan Ashwin, who raised eyebrows when Rising Pune Supergiants bought him for Rs 4.5 crore, has a base price of R 10 lakh. Nathu Singh, who didn’t play a single game for Mumbai Indians despite being bought for Rs 3.2 crore, has a base price of 30 lakh. \nWith a few England players attracting attention in the recently concluded tour of India, it wasn’t surprising to find their names in the top bracket of the list. However this being the last year of the 10-year IPL cycle, franchises are expected to be cautious about buying. All players go back to the auction table for the 2018 IPL when Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings also return after serving a two-year ban for breaching the IPL anti-corruption code. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T02:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:32:52.165+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
