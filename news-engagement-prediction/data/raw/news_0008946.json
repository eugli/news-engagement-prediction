However, the Meteorological Department (MeT) has forecast improvement in the weather from Monday. The highway remains closed as it is yet to be cleared off the debris due to landslides, an official of the Traffic Control Room told PTI. He said landslides have occurred at many places along the nearly 300-km highway, the only all weather road link connecting Kashmir Valley with the rest of the country. \nWatch what else is making news: \nThere have been fresh landslides because of intermittent rains and snow, which have rendered the highway unmotorable, the official said. He said many vehicles are stranded along the highway and would only be allowed to proceed further once the debris is cleared. \n“The men and machinery are on the job, once the debris is cleared off, the stranded vehicles will be allowed, subject to weather conditions, to proceed further on priority,” the official said. \nMeanwhile, many areas in the higher reaches of the Valley received fresh snowfall overnight with the famous ski-resort of Gulmarg in north Kashmir recording 10 cm of snow, a MeT official said. Gulmarg recorded the minimum temperature of minus 9.0 degrees, a drop of over five degrees from minus 3.4 degrees Celsius. \nPahalgam hill resort in south Kashmir, which serves as a base camp for the annual Amarnath yatra , recorded 7 cm of fresh snow and the mercury there settled at a low of minus 6.6, a decrease of over six degrees from 0.2 degree Celsius the previous night. \nKokernag town, also in south Kashmir, recorded nine cm of snow while the mercury there settled at minus 0.7 degree Celsius.
