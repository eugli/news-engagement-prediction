The school was in pretty bad repair so maybe the dust came down from the ceiling when the door closed.\" Image copyright Google Image caption Ms Doughty was a pupil at Haggerston School 'Used extensively' \nMs Doughty said if it was proved the music room was the cause of her cancer, then it was \"possible that many others have been affected\". \n\"I wanted to raise awareness of this and to appeal for anyone else who has been affected, pupils or teachers, to get in touch.\" \nMs Doughty's lawyers, Slater and Gordon, have found that asbestos ceiling tiles were in place during the time that she was a pupil at the school. \nThey are considering taken further legal action. \nA Hackney Council spokesman said: \"Asbestos was historically used extensively in both public and private buildings due to its fire retardant properties and, as with any building of this age, Haggerston School has been subject to regular condition and asbestos surveys and removals.\" \nEdmund Young, an asbestos-related disease specialist at the law firm, said: \"Mesothelioma is traditionally a form of cancer that has affected those working in industrial jobs, but we are seeing more and more people - both teachers and former pupils - coming to us who have breathed in asbestos particles while at school.\" Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T23:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T18:51:14.319+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
