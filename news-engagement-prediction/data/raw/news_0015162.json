Most of them have never done anything but be a politician.\" \n\"I don't really care if you're Republican or Democrat. I would like you if you were a Democrat if you had actually started a business and you'd actually created a job,\" she said. \n\"Donald Trump is extremely attractive to me because he's been so successful and the man has created a lot of jobs.\" \nPark Avenue executive Mike Miele agreed that the new leader's commercial acumen would benefit the nation.

I thought she had management competence, but he had a vision,\" Mr Miele said. \n\"My key hope is that there will once again be a high degree of business start up, that he will create confidence. He already is — look how the stock market has responded. \n\"I own office buildings, I'm a rich guy, but I need newly formed businesses for my buildings in New Jersey.\" Straight-talking Trump hitting the right beats \nThe second key aspect of Mr Trump's leadership they like is what they see as his honesty, or at the least, they say his \"straight-talking\" approach suggests transparency. Donald Trump's presidency has those in Washington guessing as to what's coming or where the country is going. \n\"With Trump … he's letting you know right away where he's at on a given topic. So we're not in the dark,\" said Mark Hoff, a family medicine doctor from Lodi, Northern California. \nAnd Cathy O'Dell Town, a small businesswoman from Orange Country, Southern California, believes the real estate magnate's often criticised words are evidence Mr Trump will have the courage to implement controversial policies. \n\"I'm sure that there could be a little more polish, I'm sure that he could have pulled back a little bit,\" Ms O'Dell Town said. \n\"But he has the guts to say things that people have been saying quietly and whispering but don't have the courage to say out loud.\" \nThe third key point they all express is that they think Mr Trump has a rare strength of personality lacking in most politicians.

(ABC News: Jo Jarvis) \nKaren Franks, a Los Angeles Attorney, said this is clear because few leaders have endured the attacks Mr Trump has, and emerged victorious. \n\"I think he's more capable [than most] because he weathered the most unbelievable intense storm of malarkey that I've ever seen anybody ever go through,\" she said. The idea of America as a land of opportunity can starkly contrast with the reality, writes Freya Petersen. \n\"To get something done and achieve some of the changes in the polarised society that we live in right now, you need someone who is able to take hits and not fold. \n\"Making the type of changes that need to happen in the USA today is not going to be an easy task and what we know for certain is this is a person who can weather a storm\". \nIleana Garcia, a communications specialist and founder of Latinas for Trump, believes the new president's strong character has sparked something akin to a political renaissance. \n\"I support Donald Trump because it's a moment in America when we need him so much. We need strength, we need discipline, accountability, a prosperous economy and that's what he, the man, represents,\" Ms Garcia said. \n\"That's why he got a whole movement behind him\".
