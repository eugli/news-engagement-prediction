Henry knows how to throw a party is an understatement. This is the doting father that spent about $6 million on a massive quinceañera for his daughter, Maya, back in early 2016. Singers Pitbull and Nick Jonas even performed. \nHe’s known for pulling down astronomical verdicts for his clients in the tens of millions. One case in 2015 saw a paralyzed client awarded $67 million for a serious car accident. Henry also has offices in Houston and Austin. \nPARTY MAN: Thomas J. Henry threw his daughter one of the most lavish quinceañeras San Antonio has ever seen \nAnd with Super Bowl LI in town, the ballin’ personal injury lawyer was able to work his magic in Houston for one night. \nHenry was the presenting partner of The 2017 Maxim Party on Saturday night at Sugar Land’s brand-new Smart Financial Centre. \nDONNIE AND JENNY: Leather & Laces host Jenny McCarthy talks Kim Kardashian, favorite Houston memory \nMaxim's parent company, Biglari Holdings, is also based in the Alamo City. Together the two and Karma International hosted the celebrity-filled event which at one point boasted ticket prices ranging from $750 to $38,500 before the event even began. \nOf course Maxim already has a reputation as throwing the best parties during Super Bowl week in each host city. \nLatest from the Chron.com Homepage Click below for the top news from around the Houston area and beyond.
