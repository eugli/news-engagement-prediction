While Jared works as an RN at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in California, he makes a point to spread happiness in a very unique way. Soon, other nurses began sensing the trend, feeling simply touched that Jared could spread so much happiness through his voice.\nIn addition to conversing with patients as he cares for them, Jared asks if he can sing for them. The overwhelming positive response from the patients has left Jared grateful and encouraged to keep doing his job. According to Jared, his job is not simply to care for patients. It is to bring happiness and joy to people's lives.\nMany of Jared's patients are elderly, so he likes to sing the old and well-loved tunes of the 40s and 50s. Just listen to the touching quality of his voice as he sings to his patients. The nurses who work alongside Jared share just how deeply he affects both patients and hospital staff, showing that the impact of only one small interaction with someone is truly amazing.
