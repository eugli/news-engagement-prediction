Or so we thought at the time. With the Spartans comfortably ahead against Wisconsin in the final moments of their Senior Day game, Tom Izzo subbed Harris into the game and gave him a chance to fulfill the MSU tradition of kissing the Spartans logo at midcourt. \nHarris would still have preferred to finish his college career healthy, but it's really cool that he was able to get one last pop from the home crowd at the Breslin Center.
