Even the library had been converted into office space at a Marburn Academy bursting at the seams. “We had pushed into every nook and cranny in the building,” said Head of School Jamie Williamson . “To say it was overcrowded is an understatement.” 12 photos The private school geared toward students experiencing reading difficulties and other… more The private school geared toward students experiencing reading difficulties and other academic struggles last month moved from the Northland area of Columbus to a 17-acre campus on Johnstown Road in New Albany. The building, at 64,000 square feet and accommodating 240 students from grades 2 through 12, consumes about a third of the campus, leaving room for growth. The previous school building could hold 200 students. School overcrowding is a common challenge in some communities, but Marburn Academy dealt with unusual issues – for example, there weren’t separate restrooms for the different age groups, leaving 7-year-olds to use the same facilities as 17-year-olds. Rick Milenthal , CEO of Columbus digital marketing agency The Shipyard and treasurer of the Marburn Academy board, led a $14 million capital campaign for the new school and land. M/I Homes Inc. CEO Bob Schottenstein was “intimately involved in the transaction and made sure it happened,” Milenthal said, even though the homebuilder could have built something on the land that is next to one of its subdivisions. Construction began in fall 2015. Williamson acknowledged Marburn Academy wasn’t a particularly well-known institution – $400,000 was the most it had raised in a year. Yet it raised 35 times that much for the acquisition and campus construction that began with corporate support from a New Albany neighbor. “L Brands immediately gave us $1 million before we even had a plan,” Milenthal said. “Before a design, before the land was purchased – and they did that in cash.” Then board members donated, and from there fundraising led to money from other corporate and individual donors. Milenthal leveraged relationships and their emotional connections – some high-level employees had experiences, personally or through family members, with the kinds of academic challenges Marburn Academy strives to address. As a private school, tuition can be rich. It costs $25,960 a year for second- to eighth-graders and $27,300 for high school students. Williamson says more than nine in 10 students receive scholarship money from the state, and more than four in 10 receive need-based aid from the school. The average family, he said, pays about $12,000 a year. School additions include science and engineering labs and black-box theater. The school hopes to expand its athletics and offer a band program.
