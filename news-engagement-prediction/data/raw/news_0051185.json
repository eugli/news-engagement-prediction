The yearly event is one of the most important in the tech industry. Needless to say it is not easy to get in, but those who want to give it a try can now turn in their applications! \nThe attendance process for Google I/O 2017 has begun as Google begins accepting applications. You have until February 27th at 5 PM PST to get yours in. No need to rush to your computer, though, as applicants are now chosen at random. We still remember the days when this was pretty much a race and tickets would run out in a matter of minutes. Not to mention accessing the site during that time was a mess, due to the insane amounts of traffic. Follow our Google I/O 2017 coverage \nAnyway – those times are gone and now you can take your time with the application. Chosen ones will receive their tickets on the 28th, via email. Of course, that would be after being charged the hefty entrance fee. General admission tickets go for $1150 but students can get in for $375. Be ready to pay! \nLooking to sign up? Just head to the Google I/O 2017 sign-up page linked in the button below.
