It is thought to have been practised in the Middle East for thousands of years, as Bedouin tribes used the birds to hunt in the desert. Around 9,000 birds are treated each year for a range of ailments at the Abu Dhabi hospital Combined with some of the vast wealth to be found in oil-rich Middle Eastern countries, it is not surprising the birds are often a little on the spoilt side. Owners ensure the birds are tagged with GPS devices in case they get lost. Prized specimens can reach huge sums, with outstanding breeding birds even selling for as much as £1million. The falcons are trained using toy aircraft or drones which are flown with bait attached by strings, encouraging the creatures to perform in mid-air. The photo which emerged earlier this week showed 80 birds of prey filling the cabin of a commercial plane. The photo, uploaded to Reddit by a user known only as Lensoo, carried the caption ‘My captain friend sent me this photo. Saudi prince bought ticket for his 80 hawks'. The birds were wearing special hoods to keep them docile and perched calmly among the human passengers. This extraordinary photograph showed 80 hawks who had been booked on a plane by a Saudi prince Falconry fans take their birds on a Qatar Airways flight to Baku. They escape the heat of Doha for a week to let the birds fly in the cooler air of Azerbaijan It is believed the birds were booked onto a Qatar Airways flight but this has not been confirmed. Qatar Airways guidelines states: ‘You are permitted to carry one falcon on board the economy class passenger cabin of an aircraft, and a maximum of six falcons are permitted within the economy class cabin of an aircraft (country regulations may apply)'. Transporting the animals with the airline costs between £90 and £500 per bird depending on the destination. It means the 80 creatures may have cost as much as £40,000 to transport on this one trip. The Abu Dhabi Falcon Hospital says it is the largest of its kind in the world. Qatari men hold their prized peregrine falcons on a bus after landing at Doha airport Established in 1999, it treats and examines about 11,200 falcons a year, with customers travelling from across the United Arab Emirates and from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait and Bahrain. The hospital boasts an operating theatre, advanced anaesthetic equipment, an ophthalmology unit, patient monitoring apparatus, latest laser technology, a digital radiography unit and endoscopy facilities. The hospital says it has ‘state-of-the-art intensive critical care units’ for up to 11 birds in separate rooms at the same time. There is also a separate falcon pox unit with thermo-cautery apparatus and other equipment to treat cases of avian pox. It also has its own breeding centre.
