Fortunately, a rookie officer from Glenn Heights, Texas , had his wits about him and used his Chevy Tahoe to almost certainly prevent a structure fire.\nResearch Make (e.g. Mazda) Acura Alfa Romeo AM General Aston Martin Audi Bentley BMW Buick Cadillac Chevrolet Chrysler Daewoo Dodge Eagle Ferrari Fiat Fisker Ford Genesis Geo GMC Honda Hummer Hyundai Infiniti Isuzu Jaguar Jeep Kia Lamborghini Land Rover Lexus Lincoln Lotus Maserati Maybach Mazda McLaren Mercedes-Benz Mercury MINI Mitsubishi Nissan Oldsmobile Plymouth Pontiac Porsche Ram Rolls-Royce Saab Saturn Scion smart SRT Subaru Suzuki Tesla Toyota Volkswagen Volvo Coming off a meal break, Officer Chris Womack heard a call for a motor vehicle fire at the local Jack in The Box . Living near the area, he quickly responded to the scene and encountered a fully involved Ford F-150 . Rather than just blocking off the area, Officer Womack took full advantage of his pushbar and nosed the truck away from the structure.\nThe whole ordeal took less than a minute but we are sure it saved a whole lot of money and prevented further damage or injury. Unfortunately, the truck was a total loss, and from what we can tell in the video, it still had temp tags on it-sorry man.\nAlso, solid work by the Officer's Chevy Tahoe . That beast hopped some pretty decent curbs and pushed that F-150 out of the way like it was nothing.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.fox5ny.com/news/235885438-story", "http://www.gmfleet.com/specialty-vehicles/police/chevy-tahoe-ppv.html", "https://www.jackinthebox.com/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/veoG4o3dysY", "https://www.kbb.com/ford/f150-regular-cab/1996/", "http://glennheightstx.gov/cms/one.aspx?pageId=194482"], "published": "2017-02-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T06:07:18.295+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
