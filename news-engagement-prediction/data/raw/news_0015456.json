But as the footage unfolds, we discover that she is much more than her occupation. “It’s been 95 days,” she says, referring to the time since her twin brother’s death. “ We made this oath. Whoever died first would send the other a sign.” The trailer reveals a possible spoiler as Stewart walks in on one character who has been brutally murdered. “I’m lost,” she says, apparently haunted by the presence of her brother. “I can’t tell whether or not I’m going crazy.” “Personal Shopper” reunites Stewart with “Clouds of Sils Maria” director Olivier Assayas. It is scheduled to release on March 10.
