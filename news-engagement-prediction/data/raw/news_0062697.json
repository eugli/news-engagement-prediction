But we’re going to try to rally this city together behind a team that is building something for the future of San Diego and recognizing that we’re San Diego’s team.” Photo Kevin Quackenbush, Buddy Baumann, Keith Hessler and Logan Bawcom watching their fellow pitcher Aroni Nina in a Padres spring training drill in Peoria, Ariz. Credit Charlie Riedel/Associated Press The Padres have been San Diego’s team since 1969, when they joined the National League as a mustard-and-brown expansion franchise that lost 110 games. All these years later, in generic white and navy, they still have not won a championship. The Chargers never won a Super Bowl, either; they were routed in their only appearance, in 1995, just as the Padres were swiftly beaten in the World Series of 1984 and 1998. The memory of that latter run, at least, sustains the current group. “You talk to Trevor Hoffman, and he talks about what the fans were like when they were making their World Series push,” said Austin Hedges, a young catcher who lives in town, speaking of the Padres’ former star closer. “It’s an incredible city that loves their sports teams. We don’t really think about the Chargers being gone; we just know what we’re capable of and what we want to bring to the city, and that’s a championship.” \n  For this season, anyway, the Padres might be further from that goal than any other team. They recently signed Myers, who had 28 homers and 28 steals last season, to a six-year, $83 million contract extension. But several positions are unsettled, and with few reliable starters, Green has said he may consider a piggyback style of game management, with starters replaced quickly by long relievers. Far below the surface, though, the Padres believe they are positioned well. Last summer, with several big-spending teams restricted in their spending allotments, General Manager A. J. Preller poured $70 million into the draft and international markets. He also made several trades for prospects, bolstering a farm system whose talent level has risen to third in baseball, from 20th, in rankings by ESPN’s Keith Law. Only the Braves and the Yankees rank higher. Preller was perhaps too aggressive in his trades; he was suspended for a month late last season after the commissioner’s office determined the Padres had not provided complete medical records to rival teams. But the result of the whirlwind season, Preller hopes, will be the kind of foundation that has helped his old team, the Texas Rangers, win throughout this decade.
