SMASHED WINDOWS \nAs you’ll be able to see in the image provided by Slater below, thieves smashed the windows of their rental car, before getting away with Viktor’s backpack, and Konnor’s book bag, but Slater didn’t reveal if any of his personal items were taken.

Whoever stole my backpack today is a real champion of humanity.” \nIt must obviously be a frustrating situation for them, especially when you consider that they also pay for travel and rental cars themselves and they're suffering some big losses outside of the ring, as well as unnecessary hassle. \nYou’d think that WWE increases or tighten their security at every event, as AJ Styles was also recently a victim of theft during another SmackDown Live house show. \nIn his case, a thief escaped with $1,000 in American currency, along with $7,000 in Japanese Yen. \nThey also got away with an iPhone, Beats headphones as well as his Xbox 360 and six games. \nIt’s becoming a worrying trend now, and with more reports like these coming out, you can’t help but think people could be targeting wrestlers while they’re away from their possessions. \nWhat do you make of Slater, Konnor and Viktor being robbed at a house show?
