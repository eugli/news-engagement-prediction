This is the latest flagship SoC from Samsung, and is built on the industry leading 10nm FinFET process technology. \nThe Exynos 9 Series 8895 is the latest premium application processor from Samsung Electronics, and is the first from Samsung to take advantage of 10nm FinFET process technology. This allows up to 27% higher performance while consuming 40% less power when compared to 14nm technology. \nThe Exynos 8895 is an octa-core processor, comprising four of Samsung’s 2nd generation custom designed CPU cores for improved performance and four Cortex-A53 cores for efficiency. The CPU also features upgraded Samsung Coherent Interconnect (SCI) technology which supports Heterogeneous System Architecture that enables faster calculations for areas like AI and deep learning. \nFor the GPU, the Exynos 8895 packs in an ARM Mali-G71 MP20 GPU to provide next level 3D graphic performance that minimizes latency for 4K UHD VR use cases. With 20 graphic processing cores, the performance is claimed to have been improved by up to 60% from its predecessor. \nThe Exynos 8895 also supports displays up to WQUXGA (3840×2400) and 4K UHD (4096×2160). It also supports LPDDR4x Memory, as well as eMMC 5.1 , UFS 2.1 and SD 3.0 for storage. \nThe multimedia experience for the Exynos 8895 gets a hand from the advanced MFC (Multi-Format Codec), which allows it to support video recording and playback at 4K UHD at 120fps with the latest video codecs including HEVC(H.265), H.264 and VP9. \nFor camera, the ISP on the Exynos 8895 supports 28MP sensors for both, the front and rear, as well as support for Smart WDR and PDAF. It also supports dual camera support with a 28MP + 16MP combination. The dual ISP in the SoC consists of one ISP dedicated for high quality, while the other is dedicated for low power. \nThe Exynos 8895 also features a separate processing unit for enhanced security solutions that are needed in mobile biometric solutions like iris and fingerprint recognition. There is also an embedded Vision Processing Unit (VPU) that can recognize and analyze items and movements for better video tracking, panoramic image processing and machine vision technology. \nThat is not all. The Samsung Exynos 8895 is also the first mobile processor to integrate a gigabit LTE modem in the industry that supports 5CA (Carrier Aggregation) for downlink, supporting maximum speeds of up to 1Gbps (Cat.16) as well as 2CA uplink with maximum speed of up to 150Mbps (Cat.13). \nSamsung mentions that the Exynos 9 Series 8895 SoC is currently in mass production, though they do not provide any official word on the first device that will come with it. It won’t be too much of a stretch to guess which one it will be though. \nWhat are your thoughts on the Samsung Exynos 9 Series 8895 Soc? How do you think the processor will fare against the competition?
