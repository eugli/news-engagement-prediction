Most Popular By Mattie Kahn Feb 24, 2017 The American Civil Liberties Union was founded in 1920. And in 2017, its mission, to promote free speech and end racism and discrimination, is as relevant as ever. Luckily, so are its weapons. Since the election, the organization has embraced social media, relying on its channels to communicate critical know-your-rights intel to vulnerable communities, to raise money, and, of course, to respond to President Donald Trump. And all that activity, those quips that you've been breathlessly retweeting—that's all thanks to Diana Scholl.

And people are paying attention. Throughout the first chaotic weeks of the new administration, the ACLU has been a steadying (and often rather witty!) resource. And while Scholl insists the organization's real work happens in courtrooms and war rooms and sometimes thanks to protests an demonstrations, her work amplifies those battles. It gives the voices that matter a bullhorn. Talk to us about what's been happening since Trump was elected. I think in many offices, people were in shock and didn't really work for a couple weeks. That wasn't an option [for us]. We all got to work immediately. I think at 2 A.M. the night of the election, we tweeted, 'We're ready.' And by the next day, we added, 'We'll see you in court.' We're going to need to be in this together. https://t.co/RjPcgGOuWo pic.twitter.com/DyOYA9vSQC \n— ACLU National (@ACLU) November 9, 2016 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below During the campaign, our team went through all of Donald Trump's campaign proposals and flagged what was unconstitutional. We said, 'If he implements them, they'll fail.' So when the Muslim ban came down, we were able to follow through. I think social media has had a role in that. It's our most direct way to reach people, and we've had a huge influx of followers. If you had to describe the tone you try to strike on ACLU social media channels, how would you sum it up? At least on Twitter, I think a colleague actually said it best to me: compassionate, to the point, and a little bit snarky. So then we will have the same basic response. https://t.co/tMTAWYDRWm \n— ACLU National (@ACLU) February 22, 2017 We want these platforms to give people hope and [to let] people know that we're here, we're working on this, we're not just standing by. I see it as a way to talk to one million of my friends. I think that's what people respond to—that we talk to them the way we would talk to a real person. We're not just a brand. And even though we're not able to respond to everything, we read all the messages and comments. I think it's important that people are able to come to the ACLU and have a direct line to us. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Since the election, what are some of the moments that have made the biggest impact online? The day of the Muslim ban was a day that I will remember forever. It was a Friday, late in the day. I went to bed. By the time I woke up, our lawyers and coalition partners had been working furiously throughout the night on behalf of two Iraqi refugees who were stuck at JFK. We saw the real-life nightmare impact of what had happened. We started pushing content immediately. I saw that people were going to [John F. Kennedy Airport], so I started tweeting that out. And because I'm based in New York, I went to JFK too. By the time I got there, all the lawyers were inside, camped out on the floor, and the protest was outside. Someone else on the team was at the courthouse in Cadman Plaza [where the ACLU won its first victory over the ban]. We captured that live. And throughout the day, protests were happening all around the country, celebrities were calling on people to give money to the ACLU. We had people at home retweeting content, elevating the protests, giving out information, telling those who were affected to contact a lawyer if they were detained. We were able to be a source of information in a time when a lot of people didn't know what to do.

I really feel we're a news outlet now. We have to behave like that and make sure that we're giving people the facts they need. And that's why we have to be accurate. Because when the president or someone in his administration puts out a statement that's not true, it's on us to respond, 'No, actually....' Luckily, we have all these brilliant lawyers and advocates and people on staff who know what's true. It's not just me on a Twitter feed, doing this. I have the resources of the ACLU. What's your troll policy? I respond to negative comments if there is a reason to respond. If something's factually inaccurate, I will often respond to that just to correct the record. And every once in a while I'll respond to someone who disagrees with us. But I would estimate I don't respond to 99.9 percent of the trolls. On Twitter and Facebook, people must sometimes reach out to you with hard stories or with problems that not even the ACLU can fix. How do you respond? When there's actionable advice, we give it. But sometimes we just have to say, \"I'm sorry this is happening to you.\" I just got a message on Instagram from someone whose husband had been deported. I reached out to a lawyer and gave the person a number, but it was not a situation that was necessarily something we could work on. It breaks your heart. Your job requires your attention 24/7. Do you ever take breaks? It's hard. I heard someone say this and it really resonated with me: Take the time for self-care. I try to take [time] and take breaks away from work. But I think my new philosophy is that there are some times in your life when you work more and sometimes you work less. Right now is the more time. I feel really privileged that I'm able to do this.
