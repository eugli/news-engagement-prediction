The new Logitech Brio 4K Pro Webcam launches today for $199, but the high price is matched by a high number of features. Logitech has paired 4K recording with HDR, and the company’s latest RightLight features to improve low-light situations. If you’re used to holding video calls in dimly lit rooms, then the addition of HDR should improve image quality and avoid some of the typical lighting issues associated with webcam feeds. While the Brio looks like a regular webcam with a glass and metal design, Logitech has also added infrared-based facial recognition. That means you can use the Windows Hello feature in Windows 10 to log into a PC with just your face, avoiding having to enter a password. Logitech is also supporting 5x zoom at 1080p and 60fps recording at the same resolution, and the ability to alter the field of view to three different angles. Logitech says its internal motto for the Brio was to create the “Tesla of webcams,” and the amount of features certainly backs that up. With YouTube now supporting 4K streaming and HDR, the Brio is one of the first webcams to take advantage of what’s going to become common with third-party cameras soon. Logitech’s Brio 4K Pro Webcam is now available on Amazon, Best Buy, and Logitech’s own store for $199, or in Europe for 239 euros.
