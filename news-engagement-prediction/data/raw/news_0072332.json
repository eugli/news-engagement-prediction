Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Thursday, the presidential counselor weighed in on the feminist movement, saying, “It’s difficult for me to call myself a feminist in the classic sense because it seems to be very anti-male and very pro-abortion in this context.” She also criticized the participants in the January Women’s March on Washington, implying that they have some objection with women holding a position of power.

CNN has reported that the White House temporarily barred Conway from the media for making statements that differed from the administration’s official stance. Conway denied the report, saying that she took a break to tend to family responsibilities. “I don’t think I have to explain myself if I’m not going on TV if I’m out with four kids for three days looking at houses and schools,” she told Fox News’ Sean Hannity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:14:33.266+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
