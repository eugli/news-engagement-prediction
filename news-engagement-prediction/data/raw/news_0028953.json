Lim,” Aguirre said during his confirmation hearing at the Senate. \nLim is Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) Legal Office Chief Alvin Herrera Lim, who supposedlysigned a memorandum, allegedly pertaining to the reported luxurious lifestyles being enjoyed by some inmates. ADVERTISEMENT \n“There’s no proof that there were electronic gadgets, smart TV sets, air-conditioning units, internets, cellular phones. These are all hearsay because Atty. Lim did not see these,” Aguirre said. \nHe said it was “double hearsay” when Senator Leila de Lima reported this memo to the media. \n“As I’ve said , since I’ve not read this confidential report, I was really surprised because I never ordered anybody to allow these cellphones etc, gadgets to the inmates including air-conditioning units…” Aguirre said.
