Teams begin to focus on positioning themselves for the NCAA Tournament and other postseason tournaments, and media begins to talk about things like resumes and RPI. But the internet never changes. It just keeps cranking out awesome highlights, heartfelt moments, and hilarious videos week after week. Here are the five best social media moments from the past week. 5) Monday was an emotional day for fans of the Kansas Jayhawks. They saw their team trail by 14 points with just a few minutes left on the clock, and as many fans inside Allen Fieldhouse were headed towards the exits, one of the best comebacks of the season took place and Kansas sent the game to overtime. The team was able to pull out the win in OT and remain on the inside track for their 13th consecutive Big 12 title. But before all of that, fans inside Allen Fieldhouse set the world record for \"Loudest Crowd Roar at an Indoor Sporting Event\" with an astounding 130.4 decibels. — Kansas Basketball (@KUHoops) February 14, 2017 4) It's been an up-and-down year for Nigel Hayes and Wisconsin, but here in mid-February his Badgers still have a chance at the Big 10 regular season championship and a high seed in the NCAA Tournament. During Sunday's important win over Maryland, Hayes poured in 21 points and grabbed 10 rebounds. Yet after the game he still found the time for a moment with his mother, and posted this heartwarming photo on his Instagram page.

Let's set the scene. Dartmouth vs. Columbia, both teams fighting for conference positioning. With Columbia up one, they miss a free throw and Dartmouth's Taylor Johnson grabs the rebound. The rest, as they say, is history. Taylor Johnson, coast-to-coast, go-ahead bucket with 1 second left! That is an #IvyTop5 , #SCTop10 play if I ever saw one! pic.twitter.com/llq2wmr5EV — Dartmouth M Hoops (@DartmouthMBK) February 19, 2017 2) What highlight could possibly top a game winner? Well as it turns out, one that doesn't even count. But this haltime buzzer beater from Valparaiso that bounces off the top of the shot clock, straight up to the ceiling, and drops down into the basket is one of the wildest shots you'll ever see. It's destined for a long run on blooper reels, or at the very least equations in physics classes nation wide. This shot didn't count ... but WHAT? How? pic.twitter.com/i7ZfPY8t25 — ESPN College BBall (@ESPNCBB) February 19, 2017 1) But the top spot belongs to none other than Xavier head coach Chris Mack, because home video of players and coaches in their everyday lives is always hard to beat. Especially because it seems Coach Mack doesn't turn off his coaching gene when he leaves the office. No, it seems he's already starting to teach his young son the fundamentals. Eventually they'll get to the difference between a soccer ball and a basketball. Working on converting offensive rebounds into points... pic.twitter.com/AYGc3X6yOQ — Chris Mack (@CoachChrisMack) February 17, 2017 Advertisement ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T16:56:23.964+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
