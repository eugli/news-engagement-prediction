On the latest episode of Martha and Snoop’s Potluck Dinner Party , the gang throws the envy of all barbecues when these pork ribs get a “Snoopified” makeover. We weren’t surprised to learn that Snoop Dogg ’s bad-ass rib rub is anything but ordinary. But as we know, when Martha Stewart and Snoop throw a party it ain’t really a party without a surprise guest. Snoop brought in a special family member, Uncle Reo, to treat us to a Bourbon party. \nUsing a blend of unique spices (don’t even bother trying to find these names at your local grocery store), Snoop dresses up the rack of ribs from end to end. While the seasonings work their way down to the bone, Uncle Reo, who owns his own rib joint in Portland, puts us on to his bourbon-spiked barbecue sauce. The woody taste of the liquor gives the barbecue an irresistible tang, but no harm done if you prefer to go with your own special sauce. \nIf you want the ultimate falling-off-the-bone effect, don’t cut corners during prep. Be sure to remove the silverskin from the ribs before going to work so those ribs can properly soak up the bourbon….errr, flavor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:15:14.783+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
