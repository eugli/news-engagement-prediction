Really, really, really bad shape. The entire apartment was falling apart, and the kitchen was, in a word, 'destroyed'. Never had a space been more ripe for a makeover. Luckily, Sweeten was there to help Henry revitalize his space, and he didn't just stop at the kitchen. (Image credit: Sweeten ) \nHenry didn't just want to update his kitchen: he had big plans to re-orient the kitchen and tear down a wall separating it from the living room, which would bring more light into both rooms and give the modestly-sized apartment a spacious feel. (Image credit: Sweeten ) \nBelieve it or not, this is the same room. Tearing down the wall between the kitchen and living room makes a huge difference — now, instead two small cramped rooms, Henry has a single big, bright entertaining space full of significantly more light. (Image credit: Sweeten ) \nNew 5\" wide-plank wood flooring ties the kitchen and living room together, and white shaker-style cabinets lend a classic beauty to the kitchen. Henry paired them with a quartz countertop, a backsplash that incorporates steel and glass tiles, and sleek stainless-steel appliances (including the Sirius stainless steel hood, whose slim profile keeps the range hood from interrupting the space). (Image credit: Sweeten ) \nBut the crowning glory of the new space is the new washers and dryer, which hide behind the folding doors that can be seen in the very first 'after' photo. A New York apartment with a kitchen like this and an in-unit washer and dryer? Now that's real luxury. \nHenry found his contractor, Louie , through Sweeten , an online resource that connects New York-area homeowners with designers, architects, and contractors.
