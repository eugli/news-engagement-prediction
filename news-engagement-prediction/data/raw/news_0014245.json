For me, it was a shock for sure.\n“Usually, my teams are not used to conceding three goals after the first half. I don't want this. We work a lot to avoid this. When this happened, it was a shock for me. I tried to transfer this shock on to my players. To avoid it happening again in the future, to repeat it. For sure, though, it was a great shock for me.”\nT he way Chelsea immediately adapted to playing with three at the back has been one of the decisive factors of the season so far “For sure, to change your system during the game, it means you have this change in your mind,” said Conte.\n“During the game against Arsenal, in the second half after 10 minutes, I decided to change our system because, in my mind, there was this possibility. I'm very happy to have changed the system.\n“In my mind, there was this option. I knew that I had the players for this season, but we'd never tried this solution in our training sessions. I always played with four at the back, then 4-2-4, 4-2-3-1, 4-3-3.”\nN’Golo Kante was caught out for Arsenal’s third goal at the Emirates, but the midfielder has been superb ever since and is on course to collect his second title winner’s medal in two years, having been part of Leicester City’s historic success last season.\nArsenals Saturday lunchtime horror shows “It is no coincidence that they (Chelsea) are in the position that they are and Leicester were in the position they were last season,” said Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. But Conte laughed at Wenger’s suggestion that Kante is the reason Chelsea are top of the table and said: “If it is so simple, every team would pay £100million for N'Golo and would be sure to win the title.\n“If football is so simple, I'll try to keep him for our whole life in Chelsea and we'd be sure to win the title every season.\n“First of all, we didn't win the title this season (yet). I hope (we do). I hope we have at the end of the season. For sure, if this happens, for N'Golo it would be a great achievement for him. But I don't trust in the theory that you can win only because of one player. That doesn't happen. Ever. Win, draw or lose, the team is together. I'm sure about this.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:34:21.964+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
