Some monkeys can understand danger calls made by different monkey species April 29, 2015 \n(Phys.org)—A team of researchers with members from France, Ivory Coast, Switzerland and the U.K. has found that some monkeys of one species are able to listen in and respond to communications made by monkeys of another ... Game theoretic machine learning methods can help explain long periods of conflict May 13, 2010 \nResearchers at the Santa Fe Institute have developed new machine learning methods to study conflict. Their work appears in PLOS Computational Biology on May 13. Monkeys get more selective with age June 23, 2016 \nAs people get older, they become choosier about how they spend their time and with whom they spend it. Now, researchers reporting in the Cell Press journal Current Biology on June 23 find, based on a series of experimental ...

Monkeys found able to weigh risks in gambling experiments July 12, 2016 \n(Phys.org)—A team of researchers with the University of Cambridge in the U.K. has found that Rhesus monkeys are able to weigh the risks between at least two alternatives and to decide when a risk is worth betting on. In ... Recommended for you Malaria vaccine target's invasion partner uncovered February 10, 2017 \nA team at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute has discovered how a promising malarial vaccine target - the protein RH5 - helps parasites to invade human red blood cells. Published today in Nature Communications, the study ... Monkey fights help explain tipping points in animal societies February 10, 2017 \nPrevious studies of flocks, swarms, and schools suggest that animal societies may verge on a \"critical\" point—in other words, they are extremely sensitive and can be easily tipped into a new social regime. But exactly how ... Bacteria sleep, then rapidly evolve, to survive antibiotic treatments February 9, 2017 \nAntibiotic resistance is a major and growing problem worldwide.
