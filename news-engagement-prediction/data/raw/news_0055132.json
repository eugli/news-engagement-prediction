PA \nPolice have insisted they made “an appropriate decision” when Tasering a blind man after mistaking his cane for a gun. \nGreater Manchester Police (GMP) Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan said the blind man was thought to be \"acting in an agitated manner and, in the dark, the folded cane appeared to be a gun\". \nPolice were called to reports of a man with a gun on Albert Road, Levenshulme, on Thursday shortly after 6.40pm. \nArmed response officers attended, a Taser was deployed and a 43-year-old man was detained. \nMr Shewan said: \"An officer decided that in the circumstances, and to ensure the safety of the man and public, he should deploy a Taser. \n\"An initial review of the incident leads us to believe the experienced firearms officers carried out a suitable risk assessment and, with the information he had available at the time, made what appeared to be an appropriate decision. \n\"The man was uninjured during the incident and today officers have been with him, and have now apologised for what happened. \n\"The man has accepted our apology and does not wish to make a complaint however we will continue to review the situation. \n\"Our officers have explained why a Taser was deployed and the man acknowledged that his behaviour could have led to people being concerned. \n\"We regret that a Taser was used on an unarmed person and will continue to review our training in light of this incident.\" \nIn 2012, a blind man was tasered in Lancashire after his white stick was mistaken for a Samurai sword. \nThe man was walking in Chorley town centre on the way to meet friends at a pub when he was tasered and then handcuffed. \nShopkeeper Tasawar Dar, who runs the Discount Master convenience store on Albert Road in Levenshulme, told the Manchester Evening News he saw armed police arriving at the scene. \nHe said: \"I heard the police here and they shouted, 'lie down on the ground', and there was the bark of a dog as well. \n\"I saw a guy sitting on the stairs of the station and a police officer came into the shop asking for a can of Coke. I thought it was for him, they went out and gave it to the guy. \n\"They made him sit on the stairs. He looked to be a reasonable person.
