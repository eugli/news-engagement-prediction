Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA young woman horrifically scarred in an acid attack in Pakistan has shared images of her remarkable facial reconstruction, paying thanks to the Manchester surgeon who flew thousands of miles to help rebuild her face. \nKanwal Qayyum lost her nose after a jealous friend doused her with sulphuric acid as she slept in 2007. Read More \nOver the past decade, the 29-year-old has undergone operation after operation as surgeons painstakingly worked to rebuild her face, completely reconstructing her nose from tissue taken from her thigh. \nDad-of-two Asim Shahmalak, from Cheadle, was one of those who helped Kanwal. \nThe doctor spent £50,000 of his own money taking a team from his hair transplant Crown Clinic to help change the lives of seven disfigured women in the country. IN PICTURES: Acid attack victim (Warning Graphic Images) View gallery \nDr Shahmalak, best known for his work with celebrity hair transplant patients like Calum Best, took hair from the back of Kanwal’s scalp to create two new eyebrows and new eyelashes in the left eyelid. \nSince meeting Dr Shahmalak, Kanwal has got married and is now sharing her story and pictures to raise awareness about the plight of acid attack victims in Pakistan. \nShe said: “I cannot thank the doctor enough - he has completely transformed my face and I love my new eyebrows and new eyelashes.” \nDr Shahmalak, who lives with his GP wife Rubina was reunited with Kanwal on a new mercy mission to the country earlier this month. \nHe added: “Kanwal is one of the bravest women I have ever met. The surgeons have done a remarkable job completely rebuilding her features and I was delighted to be able to help with her eyebrows and new eyelashes. \n“It was wonderful to hear how she has turned her life around, found happiness and got married. \n“She is now having her nose remodelled and making amazing progress every time I meet her. It has been so rewarding to be part of her recovery.” Read More \nDuring his visit to Pakistan, he has identified seven new people he will help with free hair, eyebrow and eyelash transplants later this year, once again taking a team from Crown Clinic to carry out the surgical reconstruction. \n“I wept when I heard these women’s stories,” he added. \n“Being doused with acid because you refused a man’s marriage proposal – people were treated better in the Middle Ages. \n“Helping to rebuild their faces is some of the most rewarding work that I do. Just seeing their smiles after the surgery makes it all worthwhile.” \nDr Shahmalak, who was born in Karachi but moved to the UK after qualifying as a doctor, was introduced to the patients by the Pakistan-based charity Depilex Smileagain Foundation whose founder Masarrat Misbah has worked tirelessly to help victims of acid attacks.
