Iran said it will not halt its missile program. \nLeading religious and political figures, including President Hassan Rouhani, had urged Iranians to join the rally on Friday to \"show their unbreakable ties with the Supreme Leader and the Islamic Republic\". \nAmong Iranian officials attending the ceremony was Qasem Soleimani, who heads Iran's Quds Force and is in charge of foreign operations of the elite Revolutionary Guards Corps. \nIran said it had smashed an underground cell linked to the Islamic State group in recent days that it said wanted to \"sabotage and carry out devilish acts\" at the rallies. \n\"Some inexperienced figures in the region and America are threatening Iran ... They should know the language of threats has never worked with Iran,\" Mr Rouhani told the crowd at Tehran's Azadi Square. \n\"We are not seeking tension but we are united before bullying and any threat.\" Protesters chant anti-US, anti-Israel slogans \nThe rallies bristled with anti-US and anti-Israeli sentiment. External Link: Tweet shows Iranian children drawing on US and Israeli flags in Tehran \nSome protesters carried pictures of Mr Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and British Prime Minister Theresa May with the caption \"Death to the Devil Triangle\". \n\"This turnout of people is a strong response to false remarks by the new leaders of America,\" Mr Rouhani told state TV, which said millions had turned out at rallies across Iran. \nBut some Iranians thanked Americans for opposing Mr Trump's executive order banning travellers from seven mainly Muslim countries - including Iran - from entry to the United States. The travel ban is being challenged in US courts . \nMr Trump has criticised a nuclear deal reached between Iran, the United States and other major powers in 2015 aimed at curbing the country's nuclear work. Most of the sanctions imposed on Iran were lifted last year under the deal. \nMr Rouhani defended the deal, saying it protected the Islamic Republic's rights to nuclear power, ending Iran's political isolation and crippling economic sanctions. \nTehran and Washington cut diplomatic ties shortly after Iran's revolution, which toppled the US-backed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. \nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T05:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:58:04.888+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
