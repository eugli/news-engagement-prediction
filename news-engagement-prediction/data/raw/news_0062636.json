He had been washed out to sea by an incoming tide.\nThe pilot, who was searching for tuna, also spotted another boat of drifters from Kiribati: three fishermen who had spent 28 days in sea.\nAccording to a report in The Marshall Islands Journal, the teenager was picked up five miles away from the fishermen but they were not aware of each other.\nRescues of drifting fishermen from Kiribati are fairly common in the Pacific, though it is unusual for two boats to be spotted simultaneously.\nT he three fishermen were in a 15-foot wooden boat which had suffered engine problems. They had fishing gear and were able to survive by catching fish and sharks.\nFor one of the men, 57-year-old Arawatau Miito, it was the second time he has been rescued after drifting at sea. All four were taken to hospital and one of the fishermen was treated for dehydration.\nThe four are due to be returned to Kiribati on Sunday.\nFor decades, the record for drifting was held by two fishermen from Kiribati who spent 177 days at sea in 1992 before coming ashore in Samoa.\nHowever, this record was eclipsed in 2014 by the incredible voyage of Jose Salvador Alvarenga, a fisherman from El Salvador who was fishing off the coast of Mexico and eventually washed up in the Marshall Islands after spending 438 days at sea.\nJose Salvador Alvarenga Credit: AFP A lvarengaâ€™s young crewmate died during the early part of the journey.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T14:53:15.947+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
