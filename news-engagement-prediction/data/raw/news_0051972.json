The threats were deemed hoaxes, but the centers were evacuated as a precaution, the Times reported. \n“While we are relieved that all such threats have proven to be hoaxes and that not a single person was harmed, we are concerned about the anti-Semitism behind these threats, and the repetition of threats intended to interfere with day-to-day life,” David Posner, director of strategic performance at JCC Association of North America, said in a statement. \nPresident Trump had yet to comment on the threats as of early Tuesday. He received some criticism last week after calling a Jewish magazine reporter’s question about anti-Semitism “insulting” and responding that he was the “least anti-Semitic person in the world.” \nMeanwhile, in Missouri, dozens of headstones were damaged at a Jewish cemetery near St. Louis. \nUniversity City police did not say whether the vandalism at Chesed Shel Emeth Cemetery is a hate crime, but it’s believed that some organization was behind the crime and it was not a one individual.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T15:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T11:28:22.225+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
