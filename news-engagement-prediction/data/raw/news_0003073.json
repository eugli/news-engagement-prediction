(Getty Images: Echo) \nThe gym can be intimidating and overwhelming, but it can also be hugely beneficial. \nGetty Images: Echo Close \nYou may have heard that the diet that works is the one you stick to. The same is true of exercise; it isn't going to work if you don't do it. \nSo when it comes to finding the best exercise for you, figure out what you enjoy, then make sure you do it often. \nWalking, cycling, playing soccer, swimming and yoga are all excellent ways to get active. Many marvellously healthy people have never lifted a weight, or been to a spin class. \nBut for many of us, whether for reasons of convenience or a desire for thorough, controlled fitness that develops every aspect of the body, gym visits are a valuable fitness focus. what is fitness teaser What is fitness? \nYour overall fitness level can be broken up into three components: Cardiovascular fitness — your body's ability to transport and utilise oxygen. This includes activities like walking, running, cycling, swimming and aerobics. Balance and flexibility improve the full range of motion of your muscles and joints. Yoga, tai chi and pilates can all help you achieve this. Musculoskeletal fitness helps strengthen muscles, improve bone density, maintain a strong core and help you maintain a healthy weight. \nAll three of forms of exercise are necessary for a strong, durable and healthy body. Why train at a gym? \nThe benefit of joining a gym is that you'll be able to train across all three fitness disciplines and have access to expert instruction. \nMost gyms offer a variety of cardiovascular-based exercise machines (like treadmills and exercise bikes) and strength training equipment (such as weights), plus a choice of exercise classes to suit most age groups and fitness levels. \nIf you feel a little anxious about visiting a gym, you're not alone. Embarrassment is one of the major barriers to exercise. You need to figure out if the gym you're going to join is the right fit. \nSo look at the type of people who are already members, and see if you would be willing to puff and sweat alongside them. Also, check to see if staff are friendly and helpful. \nLarge gyms can be a little impersonal, and have a 'fish bowl' feel. These work for some, but many people prefer smaller centres that cater for overweight or inexperienced members. For example, some gyms are women only, or have rooms set aside just for women or personal training. \nEach centre will have its own unique culture, staff profile and membership base. So don't be discouraged if the first place you visit is not what you had in mind. Choosing classes Jarrod Boyle joins Life Matters to share his tips on how to choose the right gym. \nIt's also worth having a look at the exercise classes available at the gym you're keen to join. \nGyms used to be a place where people went to simply lift weights or run on a treadmill, but the majority now offer a variety of classes in aerobics, yoga, pilates and more. \nYou can expect a number of names and formats for these classes, like pump, spinning and gravity. Don't be afraid to ask what the classes focus on, and how busy they usually are. \nCheck to see that the classes on offer appeal to you, and that they're on at a convenient time. If swimming is your exercise of choice, you'll find some gyms are equipped with an indoor pool and spa. The gym floor \nIs it neat? Is it organized? Have a look at the quality of the bars and plates. Are the benches in a decent state of repair? \nIf you intend to use the machines, make sure there is a wide selection and that they have easy-to-understand charts and instructions close at hand. The equipment should be clean and well maintained. \nStaff should be available to handle any enquires about operating the equipment, and to advise on the correct technique during exercises. Teaser: Bad gym habits Beware of reception \nMore often than not, the gym reception is a very impressive affair. \nGyms spend most of their money here, thinking it's where 'the sell' really happens. Some even sell fast food and soft drinks. \nHave a look at the kinds of food they're selling and you'll quickly get an indication of the gym's attitude toward you and your objectives. \nIn short, get out of there and onto the gym floor as fast as you can. Instructors and trainers \nThe instructors are a key part of your gym experience. What you really pay a trainer for is their knowledge, and a capable trainer understands this. \nMost instructors and trainers will have a list of their credentials either on the website or displayed at the gym. Look for people who have invested time in their chosen discipline, as much as for a formal qualification. Location and hours \nThe rule of location, location, location certainly applies when you are deciding which fitness centre to join. A gym needs to be accessible and convenient if you are going to get value from your membership. \nIdeally, it should be within five or 10 minutes of your home or work, otherwise it's easy to find excuses not to go. \nAlso investigate the hours of operation, including holidays and weekends. Make sure the facility will be open at the times you intend to train. Costs and contracts \nThe price of gym membership will vary depending on the services offered and the duration of membership. The agreements and contracts you'll be expected to sign will also vary from centre to centre, and state to state. \nLook out for centres that are a 'Fitness Australia Recognised Provider'. You can find a list of registered gyms and fitness professionals on Fitness Australia's website. \nThese gyms must follow a code of practice, and while it may vary a little depending on where you are, you should expect them to have: staff who are registered fitness professionals, qualified in first aid adequate public liability insurance and professional indemnity insurance in case you are injured a risk assessment questionnaire that examines your risk in participating in a fitness service prior to commencing an exercise program a seven-day cooling-off period for memberships longer than three months. \nBefore you commit to any contract, try to find out if the centre is well established, and has a good reputation. And think long and hard before signing a long-term contract or a direct debit form, because they can be hard to get out of. \nAlso check if your membership includes car parking, lockers or reciprocal arrangements with other centres; and whether you can put your membership on hold if you become ill, or cancel it if you move. Gym selection checklist Is the gym a well established business? Is the location easy for you? Are the staff friendly and helpful? Is there a good selection of the type of equipment you want to use? Is the equipment clean and well maintained? Does the gym have lockers for your valuables? Is there plenty of parking? Can you put your membership on hold, or use it at a different location? Optional extras \nSome gyms may offer a variety of additional programs and services, such as nutrition advice, weight loss challenges, lifestyle seminars, boot camp, walking groups and personal training. \nOthers may have a juice bar, spa or sauna, or rooms designated for specific activities like stretching and massage. \nYou will have to pay extra for many of these add-ons, although you may get a free introductory trial included with your membership. \nIf these additional services are important to you, weigh up the costs, and make sure you aren't paying more for something that you could find elsewhere. Try before you buy \nBefore making your choice, try out the centre and its facilities. You can attend as a casual member (a one-off visit is usually priced at $15–20), or ask for a free guest pass. \nTry to go at the time of day you would normally be visiting, because some gyms can be very busy at peak times. Check out the parking, staff, clientele and services, and see if it's a place where you would feel comfortable spending time every week. \nMake sure there is good ventilation and hygiene, and that the change room facilities are suitable. \nTry a few different centres to have something to compare against, and take the time to shop around before making a decision. If you are still unsure, consider a one-month membership before committing to the longer term. \nAt the end of the day, exercise should be fun. A good gym will facilitate your enjoyment by providing quality trainers who can enhance the activities you choose to partake in. \nYou'll know you're at the right place when an increase in fitness comes as a positive side-effect of enjoying what you're doing. \nJarrod Boyle is a personal trainer and regular contributor to The Exercise Room on Life Matters.
