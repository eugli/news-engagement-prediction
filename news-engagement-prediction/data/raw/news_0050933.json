By Jenna Amatulli No one in New York has ever been as excited to buy a MetroCard as the individuals who have been lining up to buy the Supreme -branded MetroCards. The cult streetwear brand announced their partnership with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority on Feb. 20th via Twitter, to much celebration. Now vending in select stations: Supreme branded MetroCards pic.twitter.com/ah2kmT0laA — NYCT Subway (@NYCTSubway) February 20, 2017 There was initially some misinformation spread about the cost of the card and what denomination would yield the Supreme card. The traditional yellow MetroCards are $1 apiece, and the fare for one subway or bus ride is $2.75, unless you purchase a special deal. The limited-run Supreme card sells for $5.50. That price includes two swipes, but riders can load more money onto the card. They can be purchased at Supreme stores and the following subway stations: Broadway-Lafayette, Queens Plaza, Marcy Avenue, Atlantic Avenue, Prince Street, Spring Street, Union Square, and the 125th Street 2/3 train. One MTA worker previously said the Supreme cards were only available if customers purchased $75 cards , but the @NYCTSubway account confirmed that the cards could be purchased for any denomination. #ServiceAlert :T here is no $75 Supreme MetroCard. Cards can be bought at any value at MVM's. There is limited supply of Supreme MetroCards. — NYCT Subway (@NYCTSubway) February 21, 2017 You can check the @NYCTSubway page for updates on where the cards have sold out. They’re also being sold for even more money than they’re worth on eBay. Since the cards went on sale, Twitter has been abuzz with videos of the lines to buy them... lol i found the supreme metrocard line. there's one dude at the front buying em all up pic.twitter.com/Nl4W1jV1zT — darlene alderson (@sadwhitegrrrl) February 20, 2017 LMA hell nah.
