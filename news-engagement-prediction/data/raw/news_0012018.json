Portable browser optimizer Since this is a portable program, it is important to mention that it doesn’t leave any traces in the Windows Registry. You can copy it on any USB flash drive or other devices, and take it with you whenever you need to boost the performance for several utilities. The application has been specifically designed with this goal in mind, so it doesn't comprise any other tools besides the dedicated feature to increase the web browsing speed. In this regard, it relies on a minimal interface, with only a few options displayed in the main window. Solving issues related to profile database fragmentation Basically, it does the whole speed boosting job by solving fragmentation problems. We still don't know how exactly it achieves that because there's no help file included in the package, but developers assured that the entire process is 100% safe, so you don't risk to get your data compromised. You just need to select the profile you wish to optimize, which can be either the default one or another profile stored on your computer. It's important to keep in mind that the programs need to be closed when running the optimization, otherwise SpeedyFox has absolutely no effect on your utilities. Easy-to-use browser optimizer Although it may very well be a placebo effect, the tool seems to increase the speed of your software programs, but don’t expect very significant changes. It does solve fragmentation problems, but nothing more. The conclusion is that SpeedyFox is worth a try once web browsers and other tools start losing their agility, as it comes with a very user friendly approach and minimal configuration settings.
