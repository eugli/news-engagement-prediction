The video got cut off, at the end I say THERE IS NO PERFECT BODY TYPE IT IS 2017. Let's all take this opportunity to support one another and teach the younger generation to grow up feeling strong, powerful, beautiful, loving, caring, confident to believe that they can be ANYTHING they set their minds too. All women are beautiful and we all deserve (men & women) to grow up to believe that we can do anything we dream of. Let's keep that same mindset we had as a little kid. There was no dream that was too big, right?\nA post shared by Alexandra Raisman (@alyraisman) on Feb 15, 2017 at 12:42pm PST\nThe magazine teamed up with the Instagram account @womenirl and Health.com for the campaign.\n“I think it’s such an empowering feeling to be at a photo shoot and to know that your body’s not perfect, that you have insecurities just like everyone else,” Raisman, a 22-year-old Needham native, continued, “but you’re still having so much fun because you know you’re unique and beautiful in your own way.”\nAnd the gold medal for gorgeous goes to… Aly Raisman! https://t.co/ObThQJqinb pic.twitter.com/T2k7pFHr68\n— SI Swimsuit (@SI_Swimsuit) February 16, 2017\n“I also model because when I was younger I used to get made fun of by the boys in my class,” she said. “They told me that I was too strong, that I looked manly, and that I was anorexic and looked like I was on steroids. Of course, that really bothered me, and I used to hate the way that I looked, which, looking back, it makes me feel really sad. But that’s why I’m so proud to be in the SI Swim 2017 issue because at 22 years old I feel strong and beautiful in my own way and there is no perfect body type.”\nRaisman discussed similar feelings in a behind-the-scences video of her photo shoot, which Sports Illustrated Swimsuit posted to YouTube Thursday .\nConfident, comfortable, beautiful.
