The discovery effectively foiled a possible infiltration bid by terrorists into India. \n“In view of security scenario in the past few months on international border of Jammu region and after assessing various threats from Pakistani side, Border Security Force had taken various innovative measures to ensure foolproof security. In this context, an anti-tunnel exercise is being carried out regularly along the border,” said BSF Jammu Frontier DIG D Pareekh.

(HTPhoto) \nOn Monday, a BSF patrol specifically tasked to detect tunnels, came across the subway in Ramgarh sector, Pareekh said. \nThe tunnel of approximately 20 meters in length with a circumference of 2.5 feet by 2.5 feet originated from Pakistani side and ended 20 metres ahead of the barbed border fence in Indian territory, he added. \nThe officer said that the tunnel was yet to be completed and was detected before it reached the fence. \n“Efforts of alert BSF troops deployed in our multi-tier counter-infiltration grid once again resulted in neutralizing another attempt of Pakistan Rangers in connivance with terrorists to send them into India for terror attacks”, Pareekh said. Highlights On July 28, 2012 a trans-border tunnel from Shakkargarh area on Pakistan side had entered 540 meters inside the Indian Territory but had caved in due to rains in Chachwal Village of Samba district. · On August 23, 2014 Indian troops had detected another trans-border tunnel that ran 50 meters inside the Indian territory in Chakla area near Munawar Tawi in Akhnoor. · On March 3 last year, another trans-border tunnel originating from Pakistan was detected 30 metres inside the Indian Territory near Allah Mai De Kothe post of the BSF in RS Pura sector of Jammu district. \nFor the past few years Pakistan has been adopting the tunnel strategy to push terrorists into Jammu. \nPakistan’s trans-border tunnels have been found largely in the plains of Jammu from Chilyari in Samba district to RS Pura and Pallanwala areas of Jammu district. \nIt is the fourth such tunnel found on the border since July 2012, exposing Pakistan’s sinister game plan of trying to push ultras into Jammu and Kashmir for staging terror attacks. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T00:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:33:01.253+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
