Now, the non-profit organization Global Citizen has added an amazing parody of Adele's \"Hello\" about calling Congress to the list, and the powerful song will make you want to pick up the phone right this very second. \nThe faithful parody video, which was uploaded to YouTube Thursday, Feb. 9, is complete with dark sunglasses, sepia tones, and flip phones. An Adele look-alike sings into a phone wearing a furry coat just like the original, but the altered lyrics reveal a very different message. \" Hello, it’s me ,\" the Adele stand-in sings into a phone receiver. \"I was wondering if you had some time to support refugees.\" \nIt's an especially powerful message in light of the federal appeals court ruling to block Trump's controversial travel ban on refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries. In the video, the singer expresses her feelings towards Trump's executive orders throughout the video: \" We can go over everything,\" she sings to her rep on the other end. \"Like how they aren’t terrorists, they’re only frightened folks in need.\" \nThe emotional power ballad has been a gold mine for parody artists since its release in Fall of 2015. Versions of the song tweaking it to be about junk food cravings and a teacher's feelings about snow days have gone quickly viral, but as far as I know, this is the first time \"Hello\" has been used to discuss social justice and political action — and it's perfect. The new lyrics touch on everything from poverty, reproductive rights, healthcare reform, and national security. If that seems like a lot, well, welcome to America in 2017.

Global Citizen, a \" social action platform for a global generation that wants to solve the world’s biggest challenges” established in 2012, acknowledges in the song that it can seem daunting to phone an elected official , especially if you have never done it before. Like the uplifting anthem of the Women's March, \"I Can't Keep Quiet ,\" the \"Hello\" parody stresses the importance of speaking up for your beliefs. \nThe chorus of the song hits the nail on the head, noting that thought the House Speaker's voice mailbox is always frustratingly full we won't stop trying to reach him. \" Hello from the other side! If I have to, I’ll call a thousand times! Til you listen to us, we'll never leave you alone. But when I call Paul Ryan, he never seems to be home.\" Source: Imgur \nYou can check out the entire video here, but don't blame me if this inspiring political anthem gets stuck in your head: Source: Global Citizen on YouTube \nPhone calls and postcards can make a difference in the many political issues being decided at the moment.
