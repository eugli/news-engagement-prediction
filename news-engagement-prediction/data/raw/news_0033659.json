In 2015, the company pledged $300 million over three years for a fund to diversify its own work force by attracting more women and minorities into technology and paying for college scholarships. Since 2001, the company has contributed an average of $45 million a year to university programs, including research collaborations and scholarships. And Intel is committed to supporting the International Science and Engineering Fair until 2019. Maya Ajmera, president of the Society for Science, praised Intel as “an extraordinary partner for the last 20 years,” though she said the company never gave the society a reason for dropping the sponsorship. The society is looking for a sponsor for the international competition who will commit at least $15 million annually for a minimum of five years. It is an opportunity, Ms. Ajmera said, to “invest in the most important science and technology pipeline in the world.” Photo Mr. Jerath with a model of the device he invented for capping subsea oil spills. Credit Tamir Kalifa for The New York Times The international science contest has a rich legacy. About 60 percent of the participants are American high school students, and its alumni include Paul L. Modrich, a Nobel Prize winner and biochemist at Duke University; Brian Greene, a physicist at Columbia University and a best-selling author; winners of the MacArthur Fellowship, also known as the “genius” grant; and computer scientists at companies like Apple, Google and Microsoft. Science educators say that science fairs can nurture vital learning and life skills. Students must use critical thinking, experimentation, presentation and speaking skills, and persistence. “Science fairs still do that in a way that all the textbook learning cannot,” said Mary Sue Coleman, a biochemist, president of the Association of American Universities and former president of the University of Michigan. For Karan Jerath , years of high school science fairs fostered those skills. “I lacked confidence growing up and science fairs gave me that confidence,” said Mr. Jerath, 20, a sophomore at the University of Texas at Austin. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Struck by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010, Mr. Jerath designed an underwater wellhead capping device for taming a gusher and separating oil, gas and water for recycling. His creation won one of the top prizes at the international fair in Pittsburgh in 2015. He has applied for a patent and he has presented his idea to groups as varied as oil companies, the United Nations and young entrepreneur programs. His science fair success, he said, has “really opened up so many doors for me that I had never thought of.” Samantha Marquez , 21, a junior at Yale University, won a prize in materials and bioengineering at the 2013 international competition in Phoenix. For Ms. Marquez, a lesson from her experience is that science is not solitary, isolating work, as it is often portrayed. Winning science-fair projects, she said, typically involve consulting mentors and judges, and bouncing ideas off others. That is particularly true of the final event, where 1,800 high school students from more than 70 nations gather to compete for the top prizes. Total student participation in the global competition remains steady, according to the Society for Science. Raymond Wang , 19, a freshman at Harvard University, thinks science fairs are “misunderstood gems of education.” But a branding makeover might be in order, he suggested. Mr. Wang, who won a top prize at the 2015 international science fair, avoids the well-known label and uses “research competitions” instead. “The positioning of these research competitions as science fairs can be misleading,” he said. \nFollow Steve Lohr on Twitter @SteveLohr A version of this article appears in print on February 15, 2017, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Supporting Science Beyond The Fairs.
