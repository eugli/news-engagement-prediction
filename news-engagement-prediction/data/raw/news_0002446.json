The suppression order extends to the man's child and other identifying details. \nThe offender, who was originally charged with murder over the death, said he felt overwhelmed at being a father and having to care for his son as often as he did. \nThe child had been crying and not settling on the night of the shaking. The man said he picked his son up and shook him with sufficient force to cause head injuries that ultimately led to his death. \nHe said he immediately regretted the action and took his son to hospital after alerting a relative in the house. \nThe toddler died later in hospital of severe head trauma which disrupted the blood supply to his brain. He had retinal haemorrhages causing blindness. \nExperts confirmed the injuries sustained by the child were consistent with him being shaken. It was difficult to quantify the precise level of force required to cause the injuries received. However, it was commonly accepted it was more than normal handling or play between an adult and child. \nThe man was spoken to a number of times by police but initially maintained he knew nothing about the injuries and he had never assaulted his son. \nThe judge issued the man a first strike warning. He is due to be sentenced in March.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T10:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T05:18:00.378+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
