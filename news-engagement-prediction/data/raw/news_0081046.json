The grille was broken and the bird was stuck.”\nThe female driver pulled off the road and stopped at a nearby gas station to inspect the damage and was shocked to discover the bird lodged in the car’s silver grille, police said in a statement on Facebook Saturday.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Firefighters arrived soon after. Using a thick blanket and gloves, they removed the trapped hawk.\nAfter the hawk was placed into a container provided by employees at the gas station, it was driven by two bystanders to the Tufts center for evaluation.\nIn a statement, Dr. Florina Tseng, director of Tufts Wildlife Clinic, said veterinarians found the bird had sustained several serious injuries including head and eye trauma, a wing fracture, and damage to its tail.\nAdvertisement\n“Given the bird’s head trauma, veterinarians will need to wait until the bird is stable to perform additional tests [or] procedures that require anesthesia,” Tseng said.\nOn Facebook Sunday, police wished the bird well.\n“We are hopeful she makes a full recovery and can be returned to her home in Milford soon,” the department wrote.\nSteve Annear can be reached at steve.annear@globe.com .
