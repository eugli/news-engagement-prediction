Amazon is donating equipment and 25,000 square feet of space in its South Lake Union campus that will allow the nonprofit to continue training people who are homeless, living in poverty, have a criminal record or a history of drug abuse. FareStart offers life skills, job training and employment in the food service industry. 4 photos Amazon is donating equipment and 25,000 square feet of space on its SLU campus for five… more Founded in 1992, FareStart has graduated 8,000 people from its adult and youth programs that include culinary and barista training to give people the technical and life skills they need to thrive in the restaurant and hospitality industry. With the donation from Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN), CEO Jeff Bezos says FareStart will be able to double its training program over the next 10 years. “Poverty and income inequality are growing in Seattle,\" FareStart CEO Megan Karch said in a press release. \"Meanwhile, the foodservice industry is experiencing a shortage of chefs and other staff in higher wage positions. Amazon’s generous support will help us train more people to fill those vacant positions.\" With the donation, FareStart plans to open a second full-service restaurant to supplement its flagship restaurant on Virginia Street. It will also open three fast causal locations, a coffee shop, a catering space and a training classroom. FareStart is not releasing the names of the eateries until closer to the opening dates this summer, but said they will be \"uniquely branded to showcase specific cuisine and dining concepts.\" In addition to growing its basic culinary and barista training programs, FareStart will also launch a new paid apprenticeship program for low-income food service workers to help them gain additional skills and employment in higher income positions such as line cooks, line leads, sous chefs, supervisors and managers. The curriculum will be developed in collaboration with local employers. Over the coming months, FareStart says it will kick off a fundraising campaign to raise an estimated $6 million in remaining operating expenses necessary to develop, launch and sustain the new apprenticeship program and build capacity for the expansion.
