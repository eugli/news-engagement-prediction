February 3, 2017 12:24 AM 1 / 9 Photo: Getty Images Twenty-seventeen has seen its share of media shakeups, but the news this week that Tamron Hall would be leaving the Today show after a decade at NBC and MSNBC was one of the most surprising. Following the cancellation of Hall and Al Roker’s popular hour-long segment Today’s Take , and the news that the space would be filled with a forthcoming program starring former Fox News anchor, Megyn Kelly, Hall announced that she would be leaving the program and network that had helped launch her career. Her status as the first African-American woman to co-host Today and Kelly’s controversial tenure on Fox only added to the controversy. While the debate over what Hall will do next, and whether NBC’s decision was shortsighted, continues, a smaller question has been raised: Has the Today show lost its most prominent fashion voice with Hall? Loading View on Instagram There are certainly few anchors as invested in fashion as her. While the majority are polished, it’s unlikely that you’ll see them stepping out in a fiery Balmain minidress as Hall did at this week’s For the Love of Our Children Gala, or donning a mixed-print Sonia Rykiel like the one she wore at November’s UNICEF Snowflake Ball. Unlike her peers, Hall’s approach to the dressing has consistently been in step with runway fashions. A fan of dramatic pieces, she wears sequin-covered Moschino suits to an event at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and patterned Givenchy on the air. Treating viewers to a taste of bold design as they start their mornings—and documenting her looks on Today ’s What I Wore Today blog—she has brought a sophisticated style sensibility to the masses. Loading View on Instagram Hall’s ability to provide the millions who tuned in for each episode of Today with a runway moment gave the program an added appeal. As the heated discussion regarding Matt Lauer’s man-choker proves, the morning-show audience pays plenty of attention to what anchors wear. With her exit confirmed, Hall leaves the Today show without a compelling sartorial voice, though she’s sure to up the fashion ante wherever she’s headed next.
