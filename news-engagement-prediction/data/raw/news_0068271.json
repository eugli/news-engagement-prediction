Better-than-expected Q3FY17 quarterly numbers post demonetization and no major negative surprise in the Union Budget 2017 have enthused the equity markets to reach near the 9000 levels. Despite recent events like DeMo, changes in US trade policies towards protectionism and shift in the RBI ’s monetary policy stance from ‘accommodative’ to ‘neutral’, the markets have shown resilience and moved northward.\nThe current scenario suggests a consolidation phase at the current levels as no fresh positive triggers are seen in the market. “We believe the month of March will be eventful and volatile on the back of 5 state election results in the 2nd week with the FOMC policy meet round the corner in mid March. Q4FY17 quarterly numbers will be the key for the market direction on stock-specific basis as the PSU banking segment may come under pressure. However, investors should be cautious in this scenario and enter into fundamentally-sound companies in a staggered manner,” says Siddharth Sedani, Vice President-Equity Advisory, Anand Rathi.\nAnand Rathi recommends investors to take a look at the following investment ideas in the financials, consumption, agri, pharma and infra space with a medium to long-term view.\n1. Equitas\nCMP (22 Feb 2017): 179\nTarget Price: 265\nRationale: Equitas is strongly positioned to grow on the back of its balanced portfolio. However, the market segment which the upcoming bank intends to cater to has vast untapped business potential and exploiting it effectively will drive the company’s growth for multiple years. Equitas is expected to attract meaningful valuation premium due to sustainability of high growth in its diversified business and lower liquidity risk as it converts into a bank.\nYou may also watch:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:34:02.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
