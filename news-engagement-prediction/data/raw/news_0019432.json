Here’s how they did it February 9, 2017 1:37PM EST Follow@ philwest \nIn 2017, as in 2015, MLS will bring in two teams: one that’s already cultivated fans through other leagues (Minnesota), and one that has been created anew (Atlanta). And with teams, obviously, expansion brings new fans from a range of perspectives and situations. \nSupporters’ groups prove particularly important for everyone involved. For teams migrating to MLS, they embody the existing history of fan support and help new fans learn the team’s particular brand of support. And for brand-new teams, they have been working (in some cases, before the team was even officially announced) to build that city’s fan culture. \nFor those in one of the potential new MLS cities curious about creating a supporters’ group, we spoke to representatives from four groups aligned with 2015 and 2017 expansion teams to get a better sense of what it takes to start and sustain an expansion supporters’ group. \nPhoto via USA Today Sports Images The Third Rail, NYCFC Rox Fontaine, president Origins \nOn May 21, 2013, the day of the official MLS announcement bringing NYCFC into the world, a group of prospective fans took to social media and organized a new supporters’ group. For their one-year anniversary, the fledgling group voted in the Third Rail as the official group name. How they grew \nFontaine notes that initially, the new front office and SG “supported each other as they were both coming from nothing. The club helped raise the profile of the Third Rail, and vice versa.” Today, with both entities more established, “[they] are raising our own profile by playing to [their] biggest strengths which are social media engagement and event planning.” Their relationship with the front office \n“Our relationship with the front office developed very easily and naturally; we were the first,” Fontaine says. That continues to this day. “They truly support us and work with us to make our oddball situation as comfortable as possible.” Three pieces of advice for those who want to start a supporters’ group “You have to be able to say no, and be okay with having said no. The exposure changes things and a group that used to be one thing or one way can change to another under the big lights.” “Don't be bound by old ideas. In our case, we're a brand-new team in a relatively new league, and there are any number of places to draw influence from. It can be difficult to push for new ideas and experiences when there is so much fixation on the way team X, Y or Z does or did things.” “Think long-term. It's very easy to get caught up in what's exciting right now, but long-term vision will separate the best from the rest.” One thing you shouldn’t do \n“You shouldn't think small.” Terminus Legion, Atlanta United FC Jorge Alonso, director of brand development Origins \nAccording to Jorge, Terminus Legion grew out of the “ATL Wants MLS” campaign, a fan-driven initiative in 2011 to demonstrate to MLS that soccer fans in Atlanta were ready for a team. More than 3000 signed the initial petition, and Terminus Legion launched as a group in support of Atlanta soccer in February 2014. That was just before MLS made the then-rumored announcement about an Atlanta team official. How they grew \nThe drive to bring an MLS team to Atlanta gave them a database of potential fans from which to draw, but they’ve largely relied on social media to increase their presence and grow their awareness. Alonso notes they make sure they’re at parades and other city events, wearing Terminus Legion-branded scarves and shirts, and talking to those who want to know more about the group at those public events. Their relationship with the front office \nAlonso is proud of the relationship his group’s been able to forge there. Atlanta United has two employees who specifically work with Terminus Legion and the team’s other emerging supporters’ groups. They are able to email back-and-forth on matters in addition to holding regular meetings. And as Alonso proudly notes, “There are other people in the front office, including in the sales department, who are Terminus Legion members.” Three pieces of advice for those who want to start a supporters’ group “Get your relationship with the front office going quickly. You’ll need contacts with the front office when you want to make things happen for your supporters’ group.” “Develop solid social media. It’s simply how news is communicated today, and it’s democratized media. We started early, and it’s helped us reach beyond our members.” While Terminus Legion officially has around 400 paid members, their Facebook page has 4000 members — some of whom they believe are future members waiting for the team to play its first match. “Find a charity to work with. It doesn’t have to be soccer-related, though with Soccer in the Streets, we were able to find one. There’s a legitimacy that gives you — it lets people know that you’re about something else.” One thing you shouldn’t do \n“Don’t alienate anyone. We’ve run across people who think we’re not [doing this] ‘correctly.’ But there’s not one correct way to do [a supporters’ group]. You don’t have to conform to any unwritten rules. It’s not a private club. There’s no secret handshake.” \nPhoto via USA Today Sports Images Dark Clouds, Minnesota United FC Jim Oliver, president and board member Origins \nAs Oliver remembers, the Dark Clouds started as a group of fans sitting behind the visitors’ bench at matches for the former Minnesota Thunder, who played in USL. The group name, a joke about fans aspiring to “ultras”-style support, grew to where one member of the group handed out buttons, each featuring a “fluffy black cartoon cloud,” says Oliver. How they grew Oliver notes that after the Thunder folded and the team then reorganized as an NASL-owned club, the fans decided they needed to act to help keep the team there. So they formed a governing structure and encouraged season ticket sales. They also coordinated transportation to home matches, as the team played in the National Sports Center in Blaine, a Twin Cities suburb. Their relationship with the front office \nOliver notes owner Bill McGuire and president Nick Rogers saw Dark Clouds’ presence as an indicator that Minnesota would support an MLS team, once the team moved to the league. \n“They've been working with us since they arrived on the scene. We actually have a business relationship because of our memberships being bundled with season tickets, so that helps keep us talking to each other productively,” say Oliver. “We're also working with the club, the city, and our temporary hosts at TCF Bank Stadium to make sure we can get as much supporters’ section action in that stadium as is practical.” Three pieces of advice for those who want to start a supporters’ group “Make art.” “Throw parties.” “Don't listen to the armchair quarterbacking from trolls on the internet. It's super easy for people to pick apart what they do and don't like, and when you're working to get a couple hundred people standing together in public and yelling, you're making yourself a target for haters. But if you want to have an impact on the sport and your town, just focus on doing what's fun for the people around you and try to connect with those people.” One thing you shouldn’t do \n“Listen to people that tell you there's a right way to do this stuff.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T01:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T02:46:39.711+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
