However, this sudden trailer of the film featuring leaders like Uttarakhand CM Harish Rawat, PM Narendra Modi, and BJP Chief Amit Shah, has left social media in splits. The one and half minute long video, which went viral on Facebook, shows Harish Rawat as Baahubali saving his state, as Modi and Shah watch on. This clip has come even as Uttarakhand gears up for Assembly polls that are due in February. CM Rawat, like Baahubali uprooting and holding the gigantic Shiva Lingam, holds the weight of Uttarakhand on his shoulders as he projects himself as the 'saviour'. Uploaded by UP/UK live page on Facebook, the clipping has been viewed more than 260,000 times and shared over 5,800 times. However, Rawat told ABP News he had no knowledge of the video and the party is not aware of it.
