The Met Office only names storms when forecasters believe them to have the potential cause amber 'be prepared' or red 'take action' warnings and do this in order to make people more aware of sever weather. The stormy conditions follow a warm air blast from tropical America which pushed thermometers into double figures. \nNow the Met Office has issued warnings for snow and wind from the early hours of Thursday morning. \nThe warnings state: \"Snow is expected over high ground of northern England and Scotland on Thursday and may fall to low levels for a time in Scotland. \n\"In addition, strong winds are expected to develop with gusts of 50 to 60 mph. This will result in drifting of the snow and blizzard conditions over high ground. Associated heavy rain at lower levels will be an additional hazard. \n\"The combination of snow, strong winds and heavy rain is likely to lead to disruption to transport networks and perhaps power supplies.\" #StormDoris is going to push in from the west on Thursday, bringing very strong winds, heavy rain as well as some snowfall in the north pic.twitter.com/ZxeYNjQxW0 \n— Met Office (@metoffice) February 21, 2017 ⚠️Snow is expected over high ground of N England and Scotland on Thursday and may fall to low levels for a time in Scotland #StormDoris ⚠️ pic.twitter.com/Rke7qsmC6V \n— Met Office (@metoffice) February 21, 2017 RELATED STORIES here comes the sun UK set for Caribbean heat blast this weekend making Britain hotter than Barcelona and Abu Dhabi CARIBBEAN VORTEX UK weather to get hotter than Abu Dhabi as Caribbean heat blast heads for Britain - but storms and snow will follow WHAT A DIFFERENCE A DAY MAKES Snow melts after Britain's big freeze... but downpours and gales set to return ARCTIC BLAST Snow and floods to hit UK again before weather gets sunnier - but will you escape the flurry?
