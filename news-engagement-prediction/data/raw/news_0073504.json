PUBLISHED: 10:30, Sun, Feb 26, 2017 | UPDATED: 10:37, Sun, Feb 26, 2017 \nZlatan Ibrahimovic has proved his critics wrong this season at Manchester United, proving he can do it on the Premier League stage. \nThe 35-year-old striker is the highest scorer in England, bagging 24 goals for the Red Devils in all competitions. \nAnd his agent Mino Raiola has claimed Ibrahimovic will not be stopping any time soon and he predicts he will continue for at least another five years. \n\"If I have to judge him today, then it's another five years,\" Raiola told the Sunday Times. \n\"But I saw Pavel [Nedved] also. I saw Pavel push every year until one day [approaching 37] he said stop. \n\"So, it's not a question of your physics, it's a question of your mentality. \n\"How long do you want it? It's up to him and he knows that I will push. \n\"I always told him I will squeeze him like an orange. That's my job.\" \nIbrahimovic has made 37 appearances for the Red Devils this season in all competitions, scoring 24 goals and providing seven goals.
