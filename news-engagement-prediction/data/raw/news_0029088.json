The 80-year-old director used his acceptance speech to lambast the country’s Conservative government. \nLoach said his docudrama about a carpenter trying to get welfare after a heart attack shows that “the most vulnerable and the poorest people are treated by this government with a callous brutality that is disgraceful.” \nHe was cheered by an audience at London’s Royal Albert Hall that included Prince William, his wife, Kate, and nominees including Meryl Streep, Casey Affleck, Emma Stone and Nicole Kidman. \nBoth William and Kate wore black and white — he a tuxedo, she an off-the-shoulder Alexander McQueen gown and glittering chandelier earrings. \nThe U.K. awards, known as BAFTAs, are often seen as an indicator of who will win at Hollywood’s Academy Awards, held two weeks later. La La Land already is a dominant force at the Oscars, with 14 nominations. It also has won seven Golden Globes. \nBut while the luscious musical was an academy favorite, academy voters also rewarded less escapist fare. \nViola Davis won the supporting actress BAFTA for Fences , Denzel Washington’s adaptation of August Wilson’s stage drama about an African-American family. \nA visibly moved Davis praised Wilson’s play for showing “that our lives mattered as African Americans.” \n“The horse groomer, the sanitation worker, the people who grew up under the heavy boot of Jim Crow,” she said. “The people who did not make it into history books, but they have a story — and those stories deserve to be told.” \nAda DuVernay’s film about mass incarceration in America, The 13th , was named best documentary, and Laszlo Nemes’ unbearably powerful Holocaust drama Son of Saul ” took the trophy for best foreign-language film. \nThe stars brought a dose of glamour to gray, wintry London, as hundreds of fans lined the red carpet outside the domed concert hall beside London’s Hyde Park. \nMany of those attending expected politics to make a guest appearance at the ceremony, as it has so often this awards season. Streep is among the stars who have used the awards stage to criticize President Donald Trump. \nMaster of ceremonies Stephen Fry joked about Trump’s dismissal of Streep as overrated, declaring from the stage: “I look down on row after row of the most overrated people on the planet.” \nPrince William, who is also president of Britain’s film academy, presented the academy’s lifetime-achievement honor to veteran comedian Mel Brooks during Sunday’s ceremony. \nThe 90-year-old entertainer said he would treasure the award. \n“This is one of the awards you will not see on eBay,” he said. \nWINNERS \nBritish Film — I, Daniel Blake \nDirector — Damien Chazelle, La La Land \nActor — Casey Affleck, Manchester By the Sea \nActress — Emma Stone, La La Land \nSupporting Actor — Dev Patel, Lion \nSupporting Actress — Viola Davis, Fences \nRising Star — Tom Holland \nBritish Debut — Under the Shadow \nOriginal Screenplay — Kenneth Lonergan, Manchester by the Sea \nAdapted Screenplay — Luke Davies, Lion \nFilm Not in the English Language — “Son of Saul” \nMusic — Justin Hurwitz, La La Land \nCinematography — Linus Sandgren, La La Land \nEditing — John Gilbert, Hacksaw Ridge \nProduction Design — Stuart Craig and Anna Pinnock, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them \nCostume Design — Madeleine Fontaine, Jackie \nSound — Claude La Haye, Bernard Gariepy Strobl and Sylvain Bellemare, Arrival \nVisual Effects — The Jungle Book \nMakeup and Hair — J.
