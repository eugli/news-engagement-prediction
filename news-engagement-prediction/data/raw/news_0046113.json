Is Tyrod Taylor staying with the Bills after all? By Clint Brooks 1 minute ago shares By: Clint Brooks | 1 minute ago \nThe conundrum that is Buffalo Bills quarterback Tyrod Taylor will be a topic of discussion from now until March 11, when general manager Doug Whaley and the Bills will have to make a huge decision on whether they’ll trigger Taylor’s option that’ll pay him $30.75 million in guaranteed money while exercising the remaining five years on his contract. \nTaylor is also set to earn $27.5 million in 2017, paying him $12 million in salary while receiving a $15.5 million signing bonus. \nWith less than three weeks until the deadline approaches, the situation will become clearer regarding Taylor’s contract. Related: Could the Bills go after Cowboys' Tony Romo? \nAnother report emerged this morning on NFL Network’s ‘Good Morning Football’, as network insider Ian Rapoport touched on the Taylor situation in Buffalo, and he’s optimistic the Bills will be keeping their starting quarterback rather than parting ways and starting over at the league’s most important position. \n“Another one to consider, the Buffalo Bills, if they end up moving on from Tyrod Taylor, although from my understanding it is probably a better chance they keep Tyrod now, than actually cutting him, so stay tuned.” Related: Conflicting reports emerge regarding Tyrod Taylor's willingness to restructure contract \nWith each passing day, it seems more and more likely the Bills will be retaining Taylor. It would make sense, too. Taylor proved why he can be a solid quarterback in Buffalo thanks to his mobility and impressive deep ball. Last season, Taylor was passing the ball to an inconsistent wide receiving core, yet he still recorded nearly identical numbers to his breakout season in 2015. \nHowever, the Bills brass have done an excellent job revealing very little, to any considerable leaks on the context of Taylor’s contract. It looks as though this standstill could stand all the way until March 11, as the great Taylor debate remains much a mystery.
