But the phenomenon “ fits into the larger picture of basal crevasses in the centre of the ice shelf being eroded by warm ocean water , causing the ice shelf to break from the inside out.” \nScientists have been closely monitoring Pine Island, one of the main glaciers responsible for moving ice from the interior of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet to the ocean, and its connection to rising sea levels.
