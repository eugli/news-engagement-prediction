If not, then those PGA Tour mandarins in Florida would prefer to keep it that way. For the name of Dustin Johnson is one that they have, for three months, been seeking desperately to expunge. Johnson has become to his sport what his namesake Ben has been to athletics ever since 1988: a pariah, a persona non grata, a great unmentionable. \n• Golf's 10 greatest rivalries - in pictures \nPhil Mickelson, a man not normally shy of an opinion or two to judge by his Ryder Cup showing, describes Johnson’s exile since August as “kind of a touchy issue – I’d rather just stay away”. Even the ever-garrulous Graeme McDowell admits that it is “tough to know what’s going down”. On all things Dustin, golf is scrupulously cultivating the same code of silence with which it once helped to cover up Tiger Woods ’ industrial-scale philandering. Johnson was supposed to be defending his title at last week’s World Golf Championship in Shanghai and yet there was, in his absence, barely a word about him to be found.

It has the daughter of an ice hockey legend, in the form of Paulina Gretsky, Johnson’s fiancée and soon-to-be mother of their first child. It has tales of hard drug use, which have prompted Johnson to take – in the tour’s euphemistic language – a “leave of absence” to resolve his “personal problems”. And it has rumoured dalliances with two women married to his colleagues on the road, just to prove that he has learnt precisely nothing from the experience of his close friend Tiger.

If he ever decides to write a book entitled, ‘What I Did in 2014’, it would be an instant New York Times bestseller. Then again, Johnson is not exactly regarded as golf’s foremost man of letters. Many of his detractors have long agreed that this lanky son of South Carolina has a bag of cement for a brain, as reflected in Rick Reilly’s famous remark that “Dustin is so dense, light bends around him”. \n• Jordan Spieth - 10 things you didn't know about US Open champion \nBy all accounts, it is Wayne Gretsky himself who has ordered Johnson to shape up or ship out if he has any hope of hanging on to his daughter. In Wayne’s world it is, to adapt an old Robert De Niro saying, “my way or the Central Florida Expressway”. For all the young man’s world-class idiocy, though, it is tempting to wonder whether the chief outrage is not the misdemeanours themselves but the extent to which golf has gone to try to sweep them into the long grass. \n• Golf paves way for shorts... to attract youth \nFirstly, the alleged womanising: Robert Lusetich, the respected Fox analyst and author of a book about Woods’ fall from grace, wrote after the story broke that it was “not a huge secret that Johnson had affairs with two wives of PGA Tour players – one broke up the marriage”. Secondly, and more seriously, the drug-taking: Johnson had tested positive three times since 2009, twice for cocaine and once for marijuana, and yet it was not until the real reasons were blown off his withdrawal this summer from all competition that the tour decided to divulge any of it.

The disgrace is that the tour knew full well what Johnson had done, but resolved to tell the world nothing beyond a clumsy, ambiguous statement that he was taking some time away to sort his life out. This is entirely in keeping with their secret-society mentality elsewhere. In China last week, the PGA Tour made clear their disapproval of Patrick Reed for calling himself a “f-", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T16:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T11:24:27.732+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
