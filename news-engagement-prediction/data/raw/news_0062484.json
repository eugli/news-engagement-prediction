Just like Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 - which is actually developed in collaboration with Samsung - the Exynos 9 Series 8895 is built on a 10nm (nanometer) process technology. This enables it to deliver up to 27% higher performance compared to chipsets built on 14nm technology (like the Snapdragon 821), while also draining up to 40% less power. The Exynos 9 Series 8895 has four custom CPU cores, plus four Cortex-A53 cores (with a maximum processing frequency that hasn't been revealed), and includes a Mali-G71 GPU. It supports displays with resolutions up to WQUXGA (3840 x 2400) or 4K UHD (4096 x 2160), as well as video recording and playback in 4K UHD at 120fps. Furthermore, there's support for cameras up to 28 MP, including front and rear cameras with dual sensors. According to Samsung, the new processor is the first of its kind to feature an LTE modem with support for five carrier aggregation (aka 5CA). Thus, it will be able to deliver download speeds of up to 1 Gbps (1 Gigabit per second), and upload speeds of up to 150 Mbps. Another notable thing is that the Exynos 8895 comes with a separate processing unit dedicated to enhanced security solutions - including both iris and fingerprint recognition.Samsung says that the Exynos 9 Series 8895 is already in mass production, and we assume that this new chipset will be found inside the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ . However, this may be true only for the international variants of the phones, as the US models might be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835.
