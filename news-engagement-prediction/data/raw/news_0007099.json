Les Reed, Southampton’s director of football, admitted he was delighted to secure the player’s signature.\n“We have followed his progress for a significant amount of time and have worked hard behind the scenes to agree a deal for him this month,” he said.\nTransfer deadline day: Mamadou Sakho set to join Crystal Palace on loan – live! Read more \n“At the age of 25, we believe Manolo can play an important part in the remainder of the season, while still having his best years ahead of him. Claude Puel’s reputation for developing young players also makes this an ideal place in which he can take the next step in his career.”\nGabbiadini, who began his career at Atalanta, has found his opportunities limited at Napoli this season. The manager, Maurizio Sarri, first preferred Arkadiusz Milik up front and then, when the Pole sustained an injury, turned to Dries Mertens, who is not used to playing in that position. Gabbiadini joined Napoli from Sampdoria in 2015 and has scored 15 goals in 55 league appearances for them. A left‑footed player, he has six Italy caps.\n“I am very, very happy,” he said. “Since I was a kid, one of my dreams was to perform in one of the biggest leagues in the world, so now that it’s happening I can’t wait to start playing. The facilities that I have seen here are an incredible level – top-level standards even for Serie A. These are the sort of facilities that make you want to come here and perform as soon as possible.”\nOn a busy day for the south coast club that also saw them secure the goalkeeper Mouez Hassen on loan until the end of the season from Puel’s former side Nice, Southampton rejected two bids from West Brom and Sunderland for Rodriguez.\nThe second of around £12m for the former Burnley striker came after David Moyes was frustrated in his attempts to sign Leonardo Ulloa from Leicester in an attempt to replace the injured Victor Anichebe.\nSunderland’s third offer of £7.5m plus bonuses was rejected despite it matching the Premier League champions’ valuation, with Ulloa having stated on Monday that he would not play for Leicester again after being “betrayed” by manager Claudio Ranieri.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:13:57.550+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
