There is one good news though: it is not the only new Xperia smartphone that features the new 960 fps super slow motion camera as the same capability is also available on the Xperia XZs . \nThis is due to the fact that Xperia XZs is indeed sharing the same Motion Eye camera as per the higher-end Xperia XZ Premium. This include the 1/2.3” 19-megapixels Exmor RS memory stacked sensor, 5-axis stabilization system, and Predictive Capture function alongside the 960 fps super slow motion function that we mentioned earlier. \nSony has even retained the same front camera setup from the Xperia XZ Premium for the Xperia XZs which consisted of 13-mgeapixels Exmore RS sensor and f/2.0 22mm wide angle lens. Not to forget, the phone also comes with 4GB of RAM as standard. \nNevertheless, there are still plenty of things that separate both devices apart such as screen size whereby the Xperia XZs comes with a smaller 5.2-inch full HD Triluminos display. Additionally, the phone internal storage is eMMC-based instead of Universal Flash Storage that was used on Xperia XZ Premium.

Last but not least, the phone also carries a smaller 2,900 mAh battery. \nMeanwhile, Sony Mobile has confirmed that Xperia XZs will be making its way to Malaysia this coming April alongside Xperia XA1 . That being said, the company will only reveal the price tag of the device for our market as we get closer to its release date. 9 3 3 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T04:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T03:05:08.617+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
