photos\nCoyne allegedly taunts the homeless man in a video (SWNS) More A Cambridge University student – dressed in a white bow tie and black tails – has been filmed deliberately burning a £20 note in front of a homeless man.\nFootage has emerged of Ronald Coyne allegedly setting fire to the banknote whilst wearing a white bow toe and tails in Cambridge.\nIn response, some people have collected more than 700 signatures for a petition demanding the 18-year-old be expelled.\nOthers have called for Coyne to work 200 hours in a homeless shelter.\nMORE: Chilly Britain braced for freezing cold temperatures\nMORE: Canadian man missing for 5 years found living homeless in Brazil\nVideo of the incident was seen by hundreds of students after it was shared on Snapchat.\nIn the video, the student struggles to light the note, while the film-maker panned to the homeless person.\nThe student says “some homeless shelter”, and the video cuts out, which was allegedly taken in the early hours of February 2.\nView photos\nHe set fire to a £20 note (SWNS) More It has been rumoured that burning a £50 note in front of a homeless person is one of the initiation ceremonies of Oxford’s notorious Bullingdon club.\nSpeaking to student newspaper The Tab, a Cambridge resident who saw the student soon after the incident said: “I was blocked from getting into my college as some chap in white tie was being excluded by the porters.\n“I saw the videos of what he did the next morning, and am utterly shocked and appalled that someone would do such a thing.\n“I’m sure I speak on behalf of the student body when I say that we condemn such actions.”\nCambridge University Conservative Association said the student has been expelled from the association and described the behaviour as “abhorrent and repugnant”.\nHe added: “The CUCA committee became aware of serious allegations against Ronald Coyne late last week concerning his private behaviour.\n“There is no room for people who behave like that in our Association, any other University Association, or frankly our University.\n“This disgusting and abhorrent behaviour occurred completely independently of CUCA, and did not take place before or after any CUCA event.”\nHe added: “There is no room for people who behave like that in our Association, any other University Association, or frankly our University.”\nView photos\nNote-burner: Ronald Coyne (Cambridge University Conservative Association) More It has also been alleged that Coyne is a “direct” relative of Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.\nBut the Scottish Government has denied this claim.\n“The individual is not a direct relative of the First Minister or her husband,” said a spokesman.\n“It’s as simple as that.”\nHowever he did concede they were distantly related.\n“They are not really related, the connection is so distant it doesn’t even count as a relation, there are six or seven degrees between them.\n“He might go around saying he is her nephew but he’s not.\n“She has no recollection of ever meeting him. Somewhere along the line his dad is the brother of the ex-husband of the sister of the First Minster’s husband.”\nOne of those people who has signed the petition for him to be expelled, Anne Baynham from Newent, said: “He needs to learn that you can’t treat people this way and then just go about your privileged life with no consequences.”\nCoyne’s mother — Sandra McLaughlin, 46 — said she could not understand her son’s behaviour, and denied he was a toff.\n“I don’t really know why he’s done something so thoughtless and cruel,” she said\nRead More “It’s completely out of character. He did two years of volunteering at Stockbridge shelter homeless shop in Edinburgh when he was still at school.\n“It’s very surprising. We’re just a normal family. We’re not toffs, he’s not a toff.”\nA Cambridge University spokesman said: “The University is committed to respecting the rights and dignity of all members of our community.\n“We expect our students to treat others with respect, courtesy and consideration at all times, and the University takes allegations of unacceptable behaviour very seriously.\n“We do not comment on individual cases.”", "external_links": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/UBRxsYUL_pGtZMLlSRvY9Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NjgyO2g9NDc0/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/fe9363272100d3d1e97e0066dc6d5d52", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Hzd4RwkP2s8e9WME2qAYlA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9MzUzO2g9NDAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/264d743c85a778ca6a56ebdfc2cf7bc8);", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Hzd4RwkP2s8e9WME2qAYlA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9MzUzO2g9NDAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/264d743c85a778ca6a56ebdfc2cf7bc8", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/yvaim0Ibupkf.mQTLPLkGw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9MzIyO2g9NTM3/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/a8b3e626f3446e162c61a7f142a6f768);", "https://s.yimg.com/dh/ap/default/150604/orb.png);", "https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/yvaim0Ibupkf.mQTLPLkGw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9MzIyO2g9NTM3/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/a8b3e626f3446e162c61a7f142a6f768"], "published": "2017-02-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T14:41:52.787+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
