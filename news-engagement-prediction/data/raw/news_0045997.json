In a short film / commercial released earlier this month, the Yukimaru quadcopter flies to the main Oji attractions, like a scenic photo op, a temple, and the Bell of Eternal Lovers. Oji isn’t Tokyo but it still has a lot to offer visitors, like a doggo drone! \nThe film is endearing for both drone fans and people naturally inclined to enjoy views of the Japanese countryside. We’re unclear on whether this drone actually exists or is a CGI production, although RocketNews24 says it’s possible Yukimaru will show up around town at both festivals and the openings of car dealerships. So I guess it’s real? Regardless, I think the idea behind Yukimaru is to dream. Let it take you on a journey.\nMy favorite parts of the commercial are the reactions to the doggo. Like this kid whose awe I can definitely relate to:\nYukimaru Walking in the Sky And this non-reaction from these “love birds:”\nYukimaru Walking in the Sky I really wanted to GIF this whole video, but instead, I’ll let you discover the Yukimaru surprises on your own. Byeeee.\nYukimaru Walking in the Sky", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:17:50.332+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
