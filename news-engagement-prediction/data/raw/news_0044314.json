Most are in the Landes, a foie gras-producing region where the new slaughter is focused. \nAgriculture Minister Stephane Le Foll said on France Bleu radio Tuesday that the flu spread faster than expected. He said all 600,000 farmed ducks in the Landes would be killed and measures would be taken to better secure transport of poultry and limit their mobility. \nThe virus does not transmit via food and is harmless to humans.
