CAMERON BURNELL/FAIRFAX NZ \nThe decision was made by Victoria University to sell the campus in August last year. \n\"It's a complex situation and we are working through the details,\" Shannon said. \nREAD MORE: \n\"We recognise that the children and families of Karori Kids and Campbell Kindergarten have been through a great deal of uncertainty. Our aim is to ensure their existing tenancy arrangements can continue.\" CAMERON BURNELL/FAIRFAX NZ \nWhat will happen to the rest of the site is yet to be worked out. \nWhanau Manaaki Kindergartens chief executive Amanda Coulson said teachers and parents had burst into tears of relief on hearing the news on Wednesday. \nCoulson said everyone was relieved common sense had prevailed, and the services could get on and continue to provide for the community. \n\"We're feeling very reassured. \n\"We thought it should happen. It is the right thing to do, it is great the ministry and Victoria University have seen that it's the right thing to do.\" Ad Feedback \nThe two sites were included in the merger between the Wellington College of Education and Victoria University in 2004, and the title transfer that came in 2014. \nVictoria University agreed transferring the land back to the Ministry of Education was the right thing to do, Shannon said. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T11:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T06:32:19.170+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
