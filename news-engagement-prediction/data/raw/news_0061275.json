O'Keefe, playing only his fifth Test and his first in India claimed career-best 6 for 35 to help Australia take a 155-run lead over the hosts.\nO'Keefe's second spell during the second session read as: W 1 W . W . . . . . . . 1 W 1 . . . W 1 . . 1 W . His figures now is the ninth best bowling figures by an overseas spinner in India\nHere is how the Indian collapse unfolded:\n32.2 - Batting on 64, KL Rahul who looked settled in the middle, decided to take on O'Keefe but failed to get to the pitch of the delivery and edge it hit over to long-off where David Warner took a simple catch. A shot that was uncalled in the context of the match, triggered the Indian collapse. INDIA 94/4\n32.4 - One ball later, Rahane edge one to the second slip where Peter Handscomb took a good catch diving low to his right. INDIA 95/5\n32.6 - Off the final ball of the over, O'Keefe took his third wicket when Saha poked a delivery that came in after pitching and handed a simple catch to Steve Smith at first slip. INDIA 95/6\n33.3 - Nathan Lyon scalped Ravichandran Ashwin courtesy another superb catch by Peter Handscomb, this time at forward short leg. Ashwin went back to a fuller delivery and defended it; but the ball bounced of Ashwin's toes to short leg where Handcomb pounced on to the chance. INDIA 95/7\n36.3 - After Nathan Lyon removed Ashwin, O'Keefe got rid of Jayant Yadav. Jayant stretched too far in a bif to defend the good length delivery but was defeated by the run and Wade did the rest behind the stumps. INDIA 98/8\n38.2 - In his next over, O'Keefe was charged down the track by Ravindra Jadeja but the allrounder only managed to find Mitchell Starc at deep midwicket and perished for 2 runs. INDIA 101/9\n40.1 - The 32-year-old then polished off the Indian innings with the wicket of Umesh Yadav. Umesh went for a wild slog but edge it to Smith at first slip INDIA 105 all out", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T11:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T11:14:06.255+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
