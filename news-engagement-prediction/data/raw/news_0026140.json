Elizabeth Warren, on Tuesday night for reading Coretta Scott King’s decades-old letter opposing Sen. Jeff Sessions, Twitter users rallied around Warren with the hashtag #LetLizSpeak. \nWarren was reading the letter King sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1986 voicing her “strong opposition” to Sessions’ nomination for a federal judgeship. Although Democrats tried to appeal Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s invoking an arcane Senate rule against impugning fellow senators to silence Warren, they didn’t have the necessary votes . \nWarren, for her part, stepped outside and finished reading King’s letter on Facebook Live, which has since been viewed more than 4.5 million times . \nThe dust-up didn’t play well on Twitter, where elected officials and their constituents urged the Senate GOP to #LetLizSpeak. It is demeaning to the memory of Coretta Scott King and harmful to the process for the Republicans to silence @SenWarren . #LetLizSpeak \n— Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) February 8, 2017 This just happened: @SenateGOP censured @senwarren for reading letter from Coretta Scott King. Unbelievable.
