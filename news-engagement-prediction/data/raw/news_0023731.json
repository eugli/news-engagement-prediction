New behind-the-scenes pics shared by stylist Farren Fucci show the Anti singer strutting her stuff in forest green locks. \nPairing a bold, colorful dress with even bolder hair is a feat that only Rihanna could pull off. Behold: \nThere's also this video, in which Rih struts her stuff and promptly makes your jaw drop to the ground. It's been a hot minute since she last sported green, though this darker shade is much more subdued than the lime green hair she rocked in her 2014 MAC Viva Glam campaign . \nBut despite how well this look works, it appears to be temporary. A photo posted by Shannon Stokes — who worked with Fucci on the shoot — shows Rih with black hair and a lavender poof that same night. How'd she change it up so fast? A wig, most likely. \nActually dyeing your hair green is a pain in the rear , so it's understandable if Rih went the temporary route. Let's hope she busts out this wig again when St. Patrick's Day rolls around.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T06:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:54:18.223+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
