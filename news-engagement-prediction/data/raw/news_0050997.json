They retained the La Liga and King's Cup titles last season. \nBarca have again reached the King's Cup final, which will be played in May. \n\"We still have options in the three competitions, although in the Champions League it's very, very difficult,\" Pique said. \nBarca will hope to become the first team to recover from a 4-0 first-leg deficit in Europe's elite club competition to progress when they host PSG on March 8 at the Camp Nou. \nMeanwhile, Barcelona have work to do, according to Pique. \n\"We need to recover our game,\" he said. \"We have been one-and-a-half months without playing the football that we're accustomed to. It's costing us more than usual. I'm certain the coach is in his office thinking about it.\" \nBarca will fall four points behind La Liga leaders Real Madrid on Wednesday if Zinedine Zidane's team win one of their two games in hand when they play at Valencia. \nPique is annoyed that supporters booed Barcelona when they needed a late Lionel Messi penalty to beat Leganes. \n\"Barca is the club of my life and I know how things go,\" he said. \"I can understand the discontent but I'm not in agreement on how it's manifested.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:49:30.854+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
