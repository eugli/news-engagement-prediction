The kerfuffle around Flynn’s resignation comes after a damning report that the FBI also found several top Trump campaign members were in contact with Russia throughout the campaign. (CARLOS BARRIA/REUTERS) \nThe FBI interviewed Flynn on Jan. 24, just days after Trump’s inauguration, to ask him about the contents of his call with Kislyak. \nTrump, on Thursday, continued to defend Flynn, calling him a “fine person.” \nPresident Trump blasts ‘low-life’ leakers in Flynn Russia fiasco \nThe President continued to blame the media for Flynn’s fall, not his own actions. \nOn Wednesday, the leadership of the Senate Judiciary Committee asked the Department of Justice and the FBI to brief them on the situation that led to the high-profile resignation. \nIn a letter addressed to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and FBI Director James Comey, Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Diane Feinstein (D-Calif.), the chairman and ranking member of the committee, cite media reports indicating the involvement of the Justice Department and the FBI in the circumstances leading up to Flynn's resignation.
