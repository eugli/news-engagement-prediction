Looks like you might have taken a page. You're looking great. Lady gaga has said she does not believe in lip-syncing so, yeah, she was singing, she was dancing simultaneously during that epic super bowl performance but, Michael, how did she bill up the stamina? By talking and singing during her workouts. Lady gaga displaying incredibly acts of athleticism with twists and turns wowing the world with her nonstop routine. ??? For the last several months the star tirelessly working on both her body and vocals at the same time. Sharing her routine on social media from morning yoga to late night ab exercises. Her trainer posting this photo of her pregame warm-up using trx straps. Eat I'm beautiful ??? Reporter: Her workout arsenal pushing her performance and stamina on the stage giving her the strength to hit those notes and just dance. ??? Susane Pata is a group fitness instructor from crunch and she'll show us how to train like a star. Welcome. Thank you. We've seen lady gaga. She is singing while doing her cardio. Demi low separate to singing on the treadmill so are -- do they help and is it something we can do? They do help and you can do it yourself. When you're singing you're projecting so you almost are forced into this upright posture and as you're singing you're activating your core and getting stronger. It's like masking but more fun because you're singing and anybody can do it. You don't have to be a great singer. If you find yourself alone and belt out a tune, you'll get stronger. Alone is key. I don't want to be at the gym. You can go running with friends and talk to them but I'm usually passed out. I can't talk anymore. That's a good point. Running and talking to your friends. We saw lady gaga with the trx bands warming up before her performance. What was she doing. She's impressive. She looks to me she was doing a trx row. You're a master instructor at this. Yes. So the row is basically you're using your body weight and lean back and start moving the body by squeezing the shoulder blades and releasing. Want to make it tougher, step forward and it's a little tougher because you're using more body weight. My husband ordered these straps. He came in the mail. I wasn't sure what they were for and was relieved when he put them in the gym. I had no idea. Like this. Yeah. Oh, boy. Trx bands. I don't even know what to say. But I'm glad that's what this is for. Got to keep it spicy. That's it. Exactly. Gaga told me she uses the versa climber and sings while she's on the Ver climber. That's amazing. Everybody doesn't have a versa climber. Not a cheap piece of equipment. What can you do to get the same result. If you don't have one you can mimic the movement, not replicate it but on the ground so the versa climber, you have one arm moving and the other leg moving and if you want to make it tougher add elastic bands or put towels underneath you to add on more complexity. Susane, great job. This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate. Lady Gaga said that she wanted her performance to bring people together.
