However form fell away and their defensive frailties became all too clear to see. \nEarlier this month they shipped four goals to Everton so unsurprisingly the addition of Gabriel Jesus does not solve all of their problems. \nHowever Guardiola wants to fix their defensive issues and according to the the Sun he'll do that in the summer with a £55 million move for Athletic Bilbao's Aymeric Laporte . \nThe former Barcelona manager is clearly a fan of Laporte's and tried to sign him in the summer, as well as his successful move for John Stones, but had a £38 million move turned down by Bilbao. \nSince then the young Frenchman has signed a new contract which has a release clause for £55 million and despite already spending around £50 million on one 22 year old defender that doesn't put Guardiola off signing another 22 year old. \nCity were linked with a move for Southampton's Virgil van Dijk in the January transfer window but the Saints have put a £50 million price tag on the former Celtic player that Guardiola thinks doesn't represent the player's value. \nCould Laporte one day be in our All Time Spanish Premier League XI? \nIn previous years City have spent £40 million on Eliaquim Mangala and around £35 million on Nicolas Otamendi, as well as the money for Stones, with none of those players yet living up to their price tags. \nGuardiola will be as determined as ever to get his defensive recruits right in the summer with Vincent Kompany's long term future at the club becoming increasingly shorter.
