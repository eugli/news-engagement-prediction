They didn't. \nTabakau, a golfer for 17 years who plays off an 11 handicap, won't know which pro he will play with until next Tuesday when the groups are drawn but was hoping to play with Ryan Fox and to play well. \n\"I didn't think until later that I'd be playing in one of the top competitions. \n\"At the end of the day I know I'm representing Alexandra. I want to get in and post a good score.\" \nNZ Open assistant to the tournament director and The Hills head coach Allan McKay said he was really happy for a \"humble\" Tabakau, \n\"He'll have a wonderful week just being part of the event. What a thrill.\" \nMcKay said each of the seven players all \"hit it well\" and enjoyed themselves in the playoff. \nTabakau receives a minimum of two days play at Millbrook and The Hills with a professional player in the Open Challenge. \nA professional field of 144 players will play the first two rounds of the NZ Open alternately at Millbrook Resort and The Hills before the second round cut of 60 plays the final two rounds at Millbrook. \nThe tournament also hosts 144 amateur players, each partnering with a professional.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T08:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T06:19:45.320+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
