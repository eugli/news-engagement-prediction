That being said, the LG G6 has a lot of aces up its sleeve, as it’s equipped with really nice specs, and also some features that we’re not used to seeing, like the Dolby Vision and HDR10 support for its display. The LG G6 features a 5.7-inch QHD (2560 x 1440) FullVision display which comes with an 18:9 ratio, and as already mentioned, Dolby Vision and HDR10 support, which are two competing technologies, actually. \nSo, what exactly does that mean? Well, Dolby Vision is expected to improve image quality on the LG G6, quite considerably actually. Thanks to this technology, you’re supposed to notice a considerable improvement in image quality, and the company talked quite a bit about it during their press event. Videos are supposed to be brighter, and are supposed to offer a considerably better contrast between light and dark. Dolby Vision comes from Dolby, a well-known company which develops audio and imaging technology. The 5.7-inch display on the LG G6 is actually the smallest display to offer Dolby Vision HDR, though LG said that it won’t affect the image detail. In addition to all that, Dolby Vision is expected to act as a battery saving feature as well, it’s expected to save at least 15% of LG G6’s battery because the phone’s display will not have to brighten up the display physically in order to display images in HDR. In addition to all this, LG added that any Dolby Vision-compatible titles which are currently available on Amazon and Netflix will be available for their new flagship at launch. This essentially means that you’ll be getting 85 Hollywood titles and around 100 hours of TV content. \nNow, on the flip side, HDR10 is here as well. Now, these two formats are similar, but there are some differences. HDR10-compatible devices are not capable of displaying content developed for Dolby Vision, while Dolby Vision can display content developed for HDR10. Dolby Vision also offers more luminosity per square meter, though that’s not as noticeable. All in all, these two formats are quite similar, and it will be interesting to see how will Dolby Vision and HDR10 content look like on the LG G6’s display.
