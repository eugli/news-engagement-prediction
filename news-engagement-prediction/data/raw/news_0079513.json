John McDonnell says the plotters would rather lose elections than see Corbyn succeed (Photo: Getty) \n“Undermining support for Jeremy from Labour voters is important to the plotters because their objective is to ensure Jeremy trails in the polls and can’t win elections. \n“In this way they can destroy morale among party members and their confidence in him,” he writes. \n“The coup is not being waged up front in public but strictly behind the scenes. \n“Having learned the lesson of the last coup attempt - that a direct attack on Jeremy and his policies will provoke a backlash from many party members - the coup perpetrators are this time round pursuing a covert strategy.” \nThe article continues: “The coup plotters are willing to sacrifice the Party at elections just to topple Jeremy and prevent a socialist leading the Party.” \nMr McDonnell said the tactics include “daily and constant behind-the-scenes non-attributable briefings against Jeremy and his Shadow Cabinet.” Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn has announced a reshuffle of his shadow cabinet (Photo: Getty Images) \n“This constant barrage of negative briefings also crowds out any positive initiatives or narrative from Jeremy and his team. \n“It also feeds and confirms in the public’s mind that the Labour Party is split. \n“The professional planning of interventions in which attacks to undermine Jeremy are framed evidences an exceptionally well resourced ‘dark arts’ operation of the old spin school,” he writes. \nMr McDonnell said it was important to spread the message about the ‘coup’ so supporters of Mr Corbyn could “fight back.” \nBut this morning a spokesman for the Shadow Chancellor rowed back from the claims. \n“This article was written over a week ago in response to the intervention from Tony Blair . \n“It was published in print last week and only went online last night. \n“However, as John said yesterday he wants us all to focus on party unity following last week’s by-election results. \n“And he is looking to reach out in the coming days to those across all sections of the party and none,” the spokesman said. \nMr McDonnell’s comments came as Labour MPs meet tonight in the aftermath of the Copeland by-election defeat. \nThe result has piled fresh pressure on Mr Corbyn to reverse Labour's dire poll ratings. \nAt the weekend the Labour leader pledged to bring forward “very coherent”, “credible” and “solid” policies that will help revive Labour's fortunes. \nHe has dismissed concerns over his leadership, saying: “People obviously have a view, perceptions, about party leaders, and I have mine.” Like us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T17:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T13:32:06.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
