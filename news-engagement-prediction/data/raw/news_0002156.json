Under his current suspension, Abreu is not eligible to return to competition until July 1, 2018,” UFC officials wrote in a statement released on Wednesday. \nUSADA is not allowed to reveal the substance found in the latest sample that was flagged for Abreu until he releases that information or his adjudication process has been completed. \nAbreu may be facing a rather lengthy sanction if found guilty because the penalty for a second-time offender of the UFC’s anti-doping policy could lead to a suspension double the amount of time for the first offense. \nIn other words, Abreu could be staring down a four-year suspension depending on the circumstances surrounding his second failed drug test. \nBefore any of that happens, Abreu is afforded an adjudication process with USADA just like all athletes competing under the UFC’s anti-doping program.
