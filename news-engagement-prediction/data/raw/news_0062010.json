Yellow topaz and citrine are good examples. These two healing crystals are wonderful energizers, they carry sun energies and are great for uplifting depressive thoughts that linger during dark overcast periods. Anyone who suffers from SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder) will benefit from wearing either of these \"sun bright gems\" on dark days. It is little wonder that both yellow topaz and citrine represent November birthstones. These stones may feel \"too hot\" to carry in summer months. Cooler stones more suitable during hot periods are pearls and coral. Emeralds and turquoise are perfect for springtime. Sapphires and opals in autumn. SAD - Seasonal Affective Disorder Record Keepers \nStones are ancient and wise. In general, they are excellent memory keepers. Certain stones are better at absorbing and retaining information than others. I have found that red stones (rubies, carnelians, garnets, etc.) are especially good at holding onto information. Melody, author of Love is in the Earth , identifies record keeper crystals as having one or more raised triangles located on the face of the crystal. Keep a memory-keeper stone with you while attending classes if you are student. The stone will not only take notes, but will help you stay grounded and be focused on the lecture being given. Don't forget to carry your memory-keeper in your pocket on exam days. Why We Are Attracted to Gemstones \nRocks are pretty. As children, we loved to dig them out of the dirt, hold them in our hands. A child's first collection is often an assortment of colored rocks found in the play yard or fished out pebbles from the bottom of a shallow creek. You may have kept these nature treasures inside an egg carton or a cigar box. Did you keep them hidden under your bed for safe keeping like I did? How to Create a Crystal Altar Gemstones as Gifts \nGemstones are delightful to give or receive as gifts. They are mother nature's natural healers. Gifting someone with a crystal is the same as offering a healing. There are hundreds of different types of stones to choose from. \nSome people feel that crystals should never be purchased for personal use, they believe that crystals should only be accepted as gifts directly from the earth or given to you from another person. This believe is born out of the idea that crystals and gemstones come into our lives at the appropriate times when we are in need of their healing gifts. Okay, I get that, but I do not totally agree. Giving yourself a crystal is a form of self-healing. If you are in a store and you sense a vibrational pull toward a particular crystal or gemstone then it is probably meant for you. If you can afford it, buy it! If a crystal is crying out \"take me home,\" please listen! Rocks will talk to you if you are willing to listen. Crystal Healing Properties Choosing Gold or Silver Settings \nChoosing what type of metal to wrap around your stones or as settings for your gemstones in rings, pendants, and brooches is also important. Silver tends to enhance or magnify the properties of the gemstones. Gold gives the opposite effect, it tames overpowering stones. If you are extremely sensitive to stone energies, gold is a good choice because it will lower the vibrational pulse of the stone so that the healing effects are subtle, offering the wearer a more comfortable transition from imbalance to balance. Books About Crystals and Crystal Healing Lost or Misplaced Crystals \nCrystals can be purchased but they can never be truly owned. So, if you have lost or misplaced a crystal this probably means that it has found a new home where its powers can be better utilized. Or, you may get a strong urge to pass on a cherished stone into the hands of someone else. Our healing crystals are very good at sending us intuitive messages whenever they want to be given away, and to whom. \nCertain crystals carry very powerful energies and can be overwhelming when worn or carried daily. These types of crystals tend to get lost or misplaced. It is not beneficial to be stimulated by vibrational energies that are too powerful. Crystals and gemstones will either get lost permanently or will be misplaced temporarily. Searching all the nooks and crannies in your home will do no good. Not to worry, lost stones tend to resurface when their services are needed. You may think you have lost a crystal only to have it show up several months later. Or, they are replaced by a more suitable stone that unexpectedly comes your way. For example you may lose or give away an amethyst, later you find or are given a different amethyst or an entirely different type of healing crystal meant for you.It is best to allow crystals to come and go since they do their work best without restrictions. Don't feel badly if you have lost or misplaced a crystal. It is either taking a time out in hiding until you need it or it has moved on to a more suitable place or person.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:28:00.338+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
