He watches Science Channel, History Channel, ESPN, and Family Guy.\nIn a statement, he said it was a dream come true to become the next Mr. Clean.\nAs part of the gig, Jackson is headed to the Super Bowl in Houston on Feb. 5 for the debut of a sexy, new Mr. Clean commercial.\nWe won't be seeing Jackson in the commercial. The ad features the animated version of Mr. Clean, showing off some new moves and getting downright diiiirty.\nBut Jackson will continue making special appearances as Mr. Clean and you can always get your hands on that limited edition calendar.", "external_links": ["https://www.yahoo.com/style/meet-face-mr-clean-174330524.html"], "published": "2017-02-01T00:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:24:41.195+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
