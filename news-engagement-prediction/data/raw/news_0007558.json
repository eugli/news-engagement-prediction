At one point, a gunshot is heard and then the injured journalist is seen being carried away. \nThe video shot on a mobile phone and made available to bdnews24.com captures a loud sound, which is almost accompanied by a person wondering, \"One down, isn't it?\" \nAnother man nearby is heard saying, \"Yes.\" \n\"Is one down?\" another is heard asking. It is then followed by someone relaying the events on phone, \"Bullet has hit brother, yes brother yes...\"\nOn Thursday, supporters of sacked Shahzadpur Awami League president Abdur Rahim (VP Rahim) and those of the party unit's Organising Secretary and Mayor Miru were involved in a violent skirmish. \nDaily Samakal Correspondent Abdul Hakim Shimul took a bullet in the head while covering the clash. \nHe later succumbed to the injury while he was being transferred to Dhaka from Bogra on Friday afternoon. \nThe autopsy report later revealed that the bullet had pierced through Shiuml's eye before making its way to the brain. \nThe clashes erupted reportedly following the beating up of Shahzadpur Government College BCL President and Rahim's brother-in-law Bijoy Mahmud on Thursday afternoon. \nShahzadpur Police Station OC Rezaul said Bijoy's uncle Ershad Ali started a case against the mayor, his two brothers Hasibul Haque Pintu, 'Mintu' and 11 others over the attack on his nephew. \nThe mayor's shotgun has been seized and his two brothers have been \"shown arrested.\" The deceased journalist's wife has also named the mayor and one of his brothers in the murder case.\nAwami League General Secretary Obaidul Quader has said his party has tasked two of its leaders to probe the matter. \nHowever, he also confirmed the sacking of the mayor from the party. \nIn his own reactions to bdnews24.com, the mayor said, \"When they (Bijoy's men who had mounted an attack on his house) opened fire, I also shot a blank round to bring things under control.\" \nShahzadpur Municipality BCL Joint Convenor Faisal Islam Setu told bdnews24.com the mayor's brother 'Mintu' and then the mayor himself came out of the house carrying a shotgun when police clubbed the BCL protesters. \n\"Three of them were carrying firearms and the others sticks,\" he added. \nWhen bdnews24.com tried to contact the mayor again after getting the video, the mobile-phone calls were being diverted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T10:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:47:01.572+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
