That cannot stand, Brazile said.\n\"Now we learn that top members of Donald Trump 's team are trying to keep the American people in the dark about what happened. To turn our White House into a black box. That is called a 'cover-up,'\" Brazile said.\n\"There's a name for this kind of government, and it's not democracy. Last night, Republican Congressman Darrell Issa said what every Republican and every American already knows is true. We have to have an independent special prosecutor to get to the bottom of what happened last year, or we are never going to move past this as a country.\"\n  Brazile was alluding to an appearance by Issa on \"Real Time with Bill Maher\" where Issa said an independent investigation is needed into the Trump camp's contacts with Russia during the campaign.\nReports have surfaced in recent days that the Trump campaign had frequent contact with Russian spies. The White House has denied those reports.\nBrazile said Attorney General Jeff Sessions cannot be responsible for an investigation of this magnitude.\n\"That investigation cannot be overseen by Jeff Sessions, who is himself a top member of Trump's team — the same team that we now know is trying to cover up what happened,\" she said. \"And we also need an independent 9-11-style Commission to figure out what we need to do now as a nation to keep this from ever happening to our country again.\"\nAlso from the Washington Examiner CPAC straw poll: 80 percent say Trump realigning the conservative movement 86 percent of CPAC attendees approve of the job Trump has done during the first month.\nBy Al Weaver • 02/25/17 4:21 PM  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T23:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T00:10:32.592+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
