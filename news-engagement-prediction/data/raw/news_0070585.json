When you have three ball handlers (Gillespie, Andrew Funk and Matt Cerruti), guys who make free throws and Collin makes play after play it makes me look like a good coach. \n\"I was a little bit concerned before the game, (but) when they came back in pregame I could tell in their eyes (that they were ready),\" Mosco said, \"especially when you have seniors who played a lot of games, along with Tyree (Pickron) who started as a freshman. I thought they handled it (well). One thing I do is try to stay out of the way and let them get a feel for it. They looked like they were handling it fine and we didn't have to use a timeout. \n\"It's gonna be a war,\" he said. \"It's gonna be special because I talk to (Arrigale) every day. I talk to him more than I talk to my wife. I talked to him today before the game and he was trying to calm me down. . .We're friends beyond basketball. We grew up together. We had a good run and he was happy for me when I moved on. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:01:56.523+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
