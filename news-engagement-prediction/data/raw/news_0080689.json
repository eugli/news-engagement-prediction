She posted photos of the experience, showing listeners wearing headphones and crying at the new tunes. \nPreviously, Halsey had noted that her next album would be a step in a brave new direction. \"I can't believe all the amazing people I've met and stories I've heard and tears I've shed. Badlands will always be my baby, my love,\" she wrote on Twitter . \"But there are big things coming, and I didn't hold anything back.\" \nIf this new album is the kind that makes you burst into tears in a church pew, clearly she didn't.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T22:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T18:21:29.227+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
