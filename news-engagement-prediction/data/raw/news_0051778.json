Saskatoon Forecast \nToday \nSaskatoon saw a few centimetres of fresh snow this morning, which prompted Saskatoon police to issue a traffic advisory asking motorists to use caution due to “unfavourable driving conditions.” \n-10 was where temperatures fell to this morning with a few sunny breaks after the snow moved out before mostly cloudy skies built in by noon as we climbed up to -4. Looks like our little fling with spring is done & it's back to winter for awhile! https://t.co/rtXFntPSo0 #yxe #Sask pic.twitter.com/9rzuO1cDBy \n— Peter Quinlan (@PQuinlanGlobal) February 24, 2017 This morning's snow has moved out, but there's a chance of light flurries later https://t.co/rtXFntPSo0 #yxe #Sask pic.twitter.com/mzD9rVdS2C \n— Peter Quinlan (@PQuinlanGlobal) February 24, 2017 -5 and back in the clouds on this Friday morning in Saskatoon #yxe #Sask pic.twitter.com/bMu9CbuKvt \n— Peter Quinlan (@PQuinlanGlobal) February 24, 2017 \nAfter ten days in a row with above freezing daytime highs, these past few days we’ve fallen back toward seasonal values with a daytime high of -3 expected today with a chance of flurries this afternoon. \nTonight \nIt looks like another bout of snow that could amount to a few centimetres worth will likely fall tonight as the mercury drops back into minus double digits. \nSaturday \n-20 is around what it’ll feel like Saturday morning with wind chill under mostly cloudy skies with a chance of flurries before we get into some midday sunny breaks. \nMorning wind chills will drop into the -20s over the weekend. SkyTracker Weather \nTemperatures should rise up through the day into minus single digits, but it’ll feel like the mid-minus teens all day with wind chill. \nSunday \nIt’ll feel like the -20s again Sunday morning with wind chill with some more clouds pushing through along with a chance of flurries through the day. \nThere\\’s a chance of snow on Sunday under mostly cloudy skies. SkyTracker Weather \nTemperatures should rise up a degree or so warmer with a daytime high back in mid-minus single digits. \nWork Week Outlook \nA mix of sun and cloud will dominate our work week with a cooler final few days of February with morning lows in the mid-minus teens, wind chills in the -20s and daytime highs struggling to get into minus single digits. \nModels are still showing inconsistencies for the beginning of March, but at this point it looks like we’ll see afternoon temperatures back into mid-minus single digits with some more cloud late in the week. \nKirsten Morin snapped this Your Saskatchewan photo at Île-à-la-Crosse: \nFeb. 24: Kirsten Morin snapped this Your Saskatchewan photo at Île-à-la-Crosse.
