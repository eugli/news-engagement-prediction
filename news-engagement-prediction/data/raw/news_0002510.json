One is to create a higher-level drive in the organism to move in a given direction otherwise in its own fashion — the other is to activate the movements directly by tapping into the muscles or neural interfaces in the legs themselves. In the first case, the insect can get used to those urges and eventually ignore them; in the second, efficient natural movement is replaced with clumsy artificial stumbling.” \nEnter the DragonflEye, the result of a collaboration between R&D company Draper Labs and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, aimed at taking a middle ground approach to solving the problem. \nThe DragonflEye is a genetically-modified version of a dragonfly, equipped with a man-made guidance system that taps directly into the insect’s own built-in steering mechanism using pulses of light. \nA gene is inserted into the insect that adds light-sensitive proteins (opsins) to its neurons, so that the DragonflEye can respond to optical stimuli rather than the crude electrical signals used in the past to send steering commands to cyborg insects: \n“[T]his allow[s] those neurons to be activated with specific wavelengths of light, sent by an interface called an optrode. Not only that, but other genetic tweaks make the neurons actually emit light when active, so the optrode can both influence and monitor the steering pathways.” \nThe Howard Hughes Medical Institute was responsible for developing the genetic “delivery methods” that make the dragonfly steering neurons sensitive to light, while Draper Labs invented the miniaturized “backpack” used for navigation, along with the flexible optrode system used to control the neurons. \nWhen the DragonflEye becomes fully functional, according to its developers, it will be capable of performing a number of useful tasks, including “guided pollination, payload delivery, reconnaissance and even precision medicine and diagnostics.” It may also be used, of course, as part of the expansion of the government’s police state surveillance of citizens. \nAlthough its inventors seem to be mostly interested in peaceful applications of the technology, it’s a sure bet that the folks at DARPA and elsewhere are eyeing these developments with an interest in applying them to military and wartime situations. \nAs genetic engineering begins to interface with micro-engineering and nanotechnology , a number of potentially scary possibilities begin to emerge. \nSophisticated human cyborgs are likely to be developed in the very near future; there’s little to stop it from happening, and the temptation is no doubt great to do so. Between scientific curiosity and the interests of various well-financed entities, there’s a powerful impetus to find out just how far we can go in terms of using nature’s elements to create totally unnatural living things. \nAt that point, all bets are off. \nSources:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T20:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T08:35:16.846+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
