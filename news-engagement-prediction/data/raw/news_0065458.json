But not if you are Benjamin Netanyahu. In the Israeli prime minister's case, it can take more than 11 hours. \nAs you can see in the map below, created using data from FlightAware , the Israeli leader took an unusual detour when travelling from Singapore to Australia overnight. The Guardian newspaper also confirmed this unusual route with Netanyahu's delegation.

Instead, the carrier - El Al, Israel's national airline - was deliberately avoiding the airspace of Indonesia. Related Content Kevin Rudd scolds Benjamin Netanyahu amid Australia visit \nIndonesia has the world's largest Muslim population. Like other Muslim-majority nations, the country has no formal diplomatic relations with Israel because of the latter's conflict with Palestinians. Some implications of this are well known - Israeli passport holders are refused entry to a number of Muslim-majority nations, except in special circumstances, though Israeli citizens are permitted access to Indonesia on tourist visas. \nBenjamin Netanyahu's detour to Australia.

Indonesia doesn't grant El Al access to its national airspace, necessitating a circuitous route around it. \nAnd Indonesia isn't the only country to restrict access. A quick look at Netanyahu's earlier flight from Tel Aviv to Singapore also shows how the Israeli prime minister took an unusual route, which may have been designed to avoid the airspace of Saudi Arabia or another nation.
