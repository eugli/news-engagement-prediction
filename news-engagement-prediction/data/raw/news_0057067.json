A post shared by Lance Stephenson (@stephensonlance) on Feb 21, 2017 at 3:13pm PST February has been a tumultuous month for Lance Stephenson. He didn’t sign with an NBA team until this month when he signed a 10-day deal with the Minnesota Timberwolves. And just as things were looking up for the former Indiana Pacer, he suffered an ankle injury. But just because his goal of a steady NBA gig in the 2016-17 season is temporarily on hold, doesn’t mean Lance’s moral has taken a hit. Would you expect anything different from the player who once tweeted out a YouTube highlight reel of himself with “T HIS IS FOR EVERYONE WHO SAYS LANCE IS TRASH ?” In fact, Stephenson is as determined as ever based on his most recent Instagram post. He posted a stoic photo of himself on Instagram and quoted himself in it. And those are some powerful words, ones that stick with you — almost as if you’ve already been exposed to the uplifting verbiage of basketball perseverance. But these are Lance’s words, you may be saying to yourself. How could they be familiar? This is actually a Michael Jordan quote. Yup. Lance Stephenson straight up took Jordan’s quote, took His Airness’ name off of it, and replaced it with his own. This is for everyone who says Lance’s quotes are trash. He Michael Scott-ed Michael Jordan. Next Up In ##Lookit", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:00:58.409+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
