Are you happy that Robron are getting married? \nDanny: Yeah definitely, I think that after the journey they’ve been on, everyone wants them to have a happy ending. We knew a while ago it was eventually going to happen and certain things brought it forward a lot quicker than we thought. \nIt’s great that it was done in an environment which Robert and Aaron are so familiar with and it’s so intimate as well which I think is fitting for both characters. \nRyan: It’s a comfortable family affair which I thought it was quite nice. In terms of their future, being married heightens the stakes so there’s not a risk the relationship will lose the drama – they are more committed to each other and it’s more concrete so there is still a lot of potential. \nI think it’s nice to see two characters who are so in love with each other take that step. Are you glad to be welcomed into the Dingle fold, Ryan? \nRyan: Yeah, it’s nice he’s getting on with all the Dingles. It gives me more opportunities as well to have scenes with people who are so great to work with, it’s a lot of fun. I particularly remember doing Christmas with the Dingles – it’s a good gang! How is it going to be when Aaron goes to prison? \nRyan: It’s going to be a horrible thing for both of them – Robert’s life is going to be on hold just as much as Aaron’s. There’s a lot of work for him and he’s got Liv to look after too. We assume Aaron is set for a tough time in prison? (Picture: ITV; Metro.co.uk) \nDanny: Yeah, standard. There’s a particular sort of storyline they wanted to make the public aware of which you will see when it plays out. Obviously things get a bit dark for him in there, there will be certain people in there who push his buttons and make his time inside very difficult. \nYou’ll see in the lead up to the wedding this week, he starts to worry about how Liv will get on- that’s the whole reason Robert speeds the wedding up. Aaron is worried as he is the only bit of security that she has ever had but Robert wants to join that. \nThe wedding is the perfect place to say we’re one family – just because Aaron is away, it doesn’t mean that the family is going to fall to pieces. It’s a time for Robert to be strong for the family and look after Liv, Chas is there to help out too, but he knows how much of a handful Liv can be. It’s a difficult time for both of them, but the commitment with the marriage will keep them going. There’s a prison set been specially built so there will be a lot of scenes… \nDanny: Yeah, it’s great to go in to that and meet new characters but it’s going to be a dark and harrowing time for him in there. Not all of it is at a prison set, some of it is location work… How did you feel when you learned the direction Aaron’s story is taking after everything he has been through? (Picture: ITV) \nDanny: You expect it, sometimes you have to draw the viewers in and then throw it back out to them. With Aaron getting so committed to Robert, his intention is to be very positive and get through it when he goes in there. But obviously in prison, things change and other people add on the pressure. Viewers have been talking about the fact that it’s not officially a legal wedding – how much does that matter to Robert and Aaron? (Picture: ITV) \nRyan: It’s a bit of paper innit? It’s more important that we see two people making a step and commitment to themselves so it doesn’t matter to them or anyone else attending the wedding. It’s more about celebrating their relationship and the love they have for each other – it’s like a private thing for them both. \nDanny: They don’t need a piece of paper to define that they’re married – they’re both there and committed to each other so no, I don’t think it’s a problem. Might Robert seek revenge on Finn or Kasim for Aaron being inside? (Picture: ITV) \nRyan: That’s not something seen so far I don’t think. Robert needs to stay out of trouble – he needs to make sure he doesn’t give Aaron anything else to worry about while he’s in prison. Robert needs to be taking care of everything at the scrap yard, with Liv, the house, and all of that. \nHe’s trying to prove to him he’s a straight lace guy now – that he loves him and is here to support him. Is Robert now distancing himself from the White family? \nRyan: Everything is just purely about Aaron and Liv and this family unit they’ve built together. In fact, we’ve just built a new set – Robron’s flat! Though it might be a while before Aaron can move in… What do you think of the wedding set? \nDanny: The idea of it is that they know Aaron is going to prison and it’s going to be for a while – he’s going to miss all these seasons which is why they cram them all of them into one. That’s why all the Christmas and Halloween and all that other tacky stuff put in an appearance. Robert is certainly less materialistic these days… \nRyan: It would seem so, wouldn’t it? He’s working in a scrap yard – he’s not necessarily mucking in but he’s still taking care of the business and he’s not driving around in an RBRE or the bat mobile, that’s gone. He’s got himself a new toy! I think the character has changed a lot since I came in, he’s got a much more romantic storyline now as opposed to being a duplicitous villain. \nDanny: He’s more moral isn’t he? \nRyan: Yeah he’s definitely more moral. It’s interesting to see that journey. Are you excited to see the fans’ reaction to Robron’s wedding? (Picture: ITV) \nDanny: I’m interested to see it; I don’t think they’ll expect this. I think they’ll be excepting something massive, but you need to take into account that it has to be rushed purely on the basis of Robert wanting to make the three of them a proper family and also the fact that Aaron’s going to prison and it could be another year before Robert gets the chance to marry him. There’s some real intimate moments which I think it’s fair to say both of us felt on the day so I think if they take all of that into consideration, they’ll enjoy it. Will Paddy put his feelings about Robert aside when Aaron goes to prison? \nRyan: Well I think Paddy is a moral character, isn’t he? You’d think under the circumstances he’d be sympathetic and understanding towards Robert’s situation – I don’t really want to go into too much of it but yeah, I think it would certainly seem that way… Would you like Andy to come back? \nRyan: Kelvin’s very sorely missed here. He was great for me – a great character to work with and a great actor as well so I can only say yes to that really but who knows what’s going to happen? When Aaron gets out of prison, might they do a bigger and more official wedding? (Picture: ITV) \nDanny: It’s something that we’ve discussed actually, just between the two of us. Bearing in mind that the story has been sped up so Lucy can be there and Isobel can be there as well, we were discussing that there might be something later on but that’s obviously just our opinion, we don’t actually know. We’ve got the storyline in prison and there’s loads more to come before we even think about it. Do you have any preferences on what Aaron and Robert would do with surnames after getting married? \nDanny: I’ve been fighting for eight years to be a Dingle so… \nRyan: They’re both central families in the show so it would be quite weird for either of them to lose that. I think Robert, other than Diane, is the only Sugden in the show – Victoria’s now a Barton. There’s Sarah and Jack but in terms of adult characters in the show Robert and Diane are the only two remaining and they’re the flagship family of Emmerdale. You could double barrel! \nRyan: Yeah, Sugden-Dingle or Dingle-Sugden! Robron Dingden? All the press event gossip! \nIn case you missed any, here are links to all of the articles from the Emmerdale press event. \nFirst details of Chas’ exit revealed ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T17:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T12:14:08.710+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
