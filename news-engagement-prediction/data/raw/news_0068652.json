Luckily, Conan O’Brien was in Mexico recently to remind citizens that it’s their duty to be the ones to pay for it. \nIn a new edition of Conan Without Borders, a series in which O’Brien has taped spots in places like Armenia and Cuba, the talk-show host visited Mexico for a show that will air next Wednesday. \nHere's a preview of what happens when O’Brien demands payment from Mexico. O’Brien will also speak with former Mexico President Vicente Fox. You know, the guy who’s been tweeting things like this. I've made it clear, Mexico is not paying for that #FuckingWall . US Congress don't get fooled by @realDonaldTrump . You can stop his maddness. — Vicente Fox Quesada (@VicenteFoxQue) February 3, 2017 Something tells me O’Brien won’t have an easy time convincing Fox to pay for the wall, either.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T19:13:54.414+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
