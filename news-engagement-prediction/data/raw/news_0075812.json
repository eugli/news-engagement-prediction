That depends on running a large amount of air underneath the car quite quickly and then worked to the back of the car. The Red Bull 'nostril' duct. Very clever aero idea. pic.twitter.com/9TlZVC2sik \nF1 2017: The new cars revealed \n\"It's playing to Red Bull's strengths, accelerating a low pressure area under the car, through the nose. It's not a golden bullet, but everything helps in the fight against Mercedes.\" \nRed Bull are looking to topple Mercedes in 2017 after the Silver Arrows dominated the last three seasons. A 'rules refresh' may help them do just that, especially if this aerodynamic addition works its magic. Craig Slater brings you all the latest news from day one of the first 2017 test in Barcelona. \n\"Red Bull know their deficit to Mercedes is in the power department,\" added Ted. \"So they need to make their car as low-drag as possible. \n\"They can slip through the air easier than Mercedes. We'll see if they've managed to achieve that.\" \nThe Sky Sports F1 Digital team will be providing live commentary from dawn until dusk for all days of winter testing while Sky Sports News HQ will also deliver live updates from trackside.
