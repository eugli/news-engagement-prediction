There's still quite a lot of heat, and if we get the wrong wind the fire could start up again,\" Hayles said. \nREAD MORE: * Port Hills fire: How it moved \nThe Department of Conservation already sent a Marlborough crew down, but rural fire crews could not leave the region while the fire risk was still high. \nMarlborough Kaikoura Rural Fire Authority principal rural fire officer Richard McNamara, who is co-ordinating helicopters over the Port Hills fire, called for volunteers from the Marlborough Sounds to join the efforts. \nDeputy rural fire officer John Foley and operations manager Trevor Tidy were also assisting fire management, while North Bank crew leader Mary Powell and Hayles would help with fire management from Monday. \nKenepuru Rural Fire Force volunteer Stefan Schulzâ€‹ said Marlborough Sounds crews were able to spare one or two crew members. Volunteers came from Okiwi Bay, Clova Bay, Nopera Bay and Kenepuru. \nThe volunteers were leaving their day jobs, including two farmers, to head south. Ad Feedback \n\"We are all busy people in one way or another, and we do leave a hole when we go away, not just for the fire guys but it's our families that have to pick up the slack,\" Schulz said. \nIt was the first time any of them would travel out of the region for a fire, but most had experience with large-scale fires such as the Onamalutu, Waikakaho and Wairau Valley fires in 2015. \nTwo rural fire trucks would be driven south, laden with pumps, hoses, hand tools and sleeping bags. The group would spend at least five nights at the army base in Burnham, about 30 kilometres west of the Port Hills. \nFire management contracted a private company to provide drones with thermal imaging equipment to collect GPS locations of hotspots, Foley said. \n\"This thing is the size of the bonnet of a car. But it's proving it's worth. We're able to get much more accurate locations for GPS than with helicopters. It's the first fire where we've been able to give tablets to crews with a map on it so they can walk straight to the hotspots.\" \nPowerlines prevented helicopters from getting close to homes to find hotspots, Foley said. \n\"In the briefings we've told the crews, 'occasionally you'll come across people who are under a great amount of pressure and stress, and they might make comments they ordinarily wouldn't, so just keep in mind they're under a lot of stress'. \n\"And if you see someone trying to move their stuff out of their house, give them a hand. We're not just there to fight fires, we're there to help a community in need.\" - The Marlborough Express", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T06:00:25.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
