During his 13 years at Stamford Bridge he won three Premier League titles, four FA Cups and the 2011-12 Champions League. \nHe left the club in 2014, by which time he had become their record goal scorer. He spent the 2014-15 season back in the Premier League at Manchester City -- scoring against his old club in a 1-1 draw at the Etihad Stadium -- before moving to NYCFC. Frank Lampard scored 15 goals during his stay in New York. Here are the five best. \n\"After 21 incredible years, I have decided that now is the right time to finish my career as a professional footballer,\" the 38-year-old wrote in an Instagram post. \n\"I'm immensely proud of the trophies I've won, of representing my country over 100 times and of scoring more than 300 career goals.\" 100 - Frank Lampard is one of three players to record both 100+ goals & 100+ assists in PL history (also Ryan Giggs & Wayne Rooney).

I couldn't have done it without them.\" \nInformation from the Press Association was used in this report. \nFollow @ESPNFC on Twitter to keep up with the latest football updates.
