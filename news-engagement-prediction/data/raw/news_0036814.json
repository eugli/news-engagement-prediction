I would love to be in the room as a reporter writing what’s going on. Now, if they would like to invite me, I’d welcome that, but as far as facilitating that meeting or convening that meeting, that is not my place.” \nThis isn’t first time Ryan has been the focus of Trump administration news. Ryan accused White House communications official Omarosa Manigault of threatening her , adding that Omarosa claimed she was keeping “dossiers” on reporters. Manigault responded by sharing a secret recording of their encounter with other journalists. \nWatch the clip above, via CNN. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T04:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:19:11.790+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
