Key points: 16-year-old held in Barwon Prison for stealing cars Suffered fractured neck after being bashed by inmates Mother says her son had also been punched in the face by guard Lawyers had asked for boy to be removed for own safety \nThe youth spent Monday night in hospital before being released on Tuesday afternoon. \nHis mother, who along with her son cannot be identified, was horrified when her son's lawyer called on Tuesday afternoon to tell her the 16-year-old was in hospital with a fractured neck. \nShe said it is the third time her son has been assaulted in Barwon — once, she said, was by a guard who punched him in the face. \nShe said the boy had also self-harmed, cutting himself with a piece of a fan whilst inside Barwon. \nShe spoke to her son on Tuesday evening. \n\"He was outside, there was something going on inside, another incident, it had nothing to do with him,\" the mother told 7.30. \n\"He just knew the person that was involved and getting beat up, and then all of a sudden he heard his name being called and 'watch out'. \n\"Then he was grabbed from behind, thrown to the ground and repetitively stomped on until he blacked out. \n\"He's got a fracture in his neck, damage to two vertebrae, he's had a head injury, he was knocked unconscious during the incident, which was totally unprovoked.\" \nThe boy is now back in the Malmsbury Youth Justice Centre, north-west of Melbourne. \nIt has been the subject of numerous riots and disturbances, including a mass breakout of inmates in January. Do you know more about this story? Email \nThe Victorian Government has been widely criticised for its handling of problems in youth detention centres and for using adult prisons such as Barwon to hold juvenile offenders. \n\"I'm disgusted that it's taken all this, all these people, all this effort of everyone saying that they're not safe; it's not a place for children right now,\" the mother said. \nThe boy was not involved in the rioting that sparked the Victorian Government's decision to move juvenile detainees to the adult prison and he has never been involved in a violent crime. \nHe is on remand on charges concerning car theft and has been in the Parkville juvenile detention centre several times before for stealing cars. \n\"We told them they're not safe where they are and this has just proven it — my son has ended up in hospital and it's not the first time he was attacked in there,\" his mother said. \n\"He shouldn't be in Barwon — it's a maximum security prison for adults.\" \nBarwon is currently using its Grevillea Unit as a makeshift unit for youth offenders. \n\"It's not ready and it shouldn't be legal,\" the boy's mother said. Lawyers warned that the boy was not safe \nThe boy's lawyers had been begging authorities to remove him from Barwon because they believed he was at risk.

(ABC News) \nAnd despite the latest incident happening on Monday night, the boy's lawyers were not told that he was in hospital until Tuesday afternoon. \n7.30 had, coincidentally, arranged to meet the lawyer, Alina Leikin from the Human Rights Law Centre, at Barwon on Tuesday as she went to check on the boy. \nMs Leikin said she had been very worried about the boy because of the previous assaults on him and his self-harming. \nOn the way she discovered that he was not there and had in fact been in nearby Geelong hospital overnight. \nMs Leikin spoke to 7.30 after coming out of the Grevillea Unit, which is a hastily-arranged youth justice facility on the grounds of the high-security adult Barwon prison. \n\"Last week we notified the Government that this young man was unsafe at this facility, that he was feeling incredibly at risk,\" she said. \n\"This is a vulnerable boy and he expressed to us his fears about being here. \n\"The Government did not respond to the grave concerns we raised about his safety and now this has happened — and it's taken an incident of this seriousness for this boy to be removed to an appropriate youth justice facility.\" \nMs Leikin is also concerned for the safety of another boy held in Barwon and has asked for him to be removed as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T08:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T04:20:23.676+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
