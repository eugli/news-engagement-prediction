In all fairness — I've only been here for four weeks, so I can't take too much of the blame for what's happened. But it is absolutely out of control.\" Highlight of the day \nTrump had promised to issue an updated travel ban this week but on Wednesday, aides said that will be delayed until next week . They gave no explanation. \nSimilarly, aides said all day that the administration would issue new rules regarding the use of bathrooms by transgender students. The issue reportedly prompted a feud between Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Sessions pushed to overturn Obama-era rules. DeVos resisted. \nFinally, the word came down. The new president had reversed the old one's order from May 2016 that said schools had to let transgender students to use the bathroom matching their gender identity. Sessions, in rescinding that requirement, said federal laws would still protect the LGBT students from \"discrimination.\" Dissenting voices In this May 17, 2014 file photo, Adm. William H. McRaven flashes the Hook 'em Horns signal during a commencement address at the University of Texas in Austin, where he is now chancellor. (AP/The University of Texas at Austin, Marsha Miller, File) \nTrump's tweet last week calling the news media an enemy of the public continues to resonate. \nIn Austin, University of Texas chancellor William McRaven, a retired admiral and Navy SEAL, called Trump's comments dangerous . \"We must challenge this statement and this sentiment that the news media is the enemy of the American people,\" McRaven told students and faculty at the Moody College of Communications Tuesday night. \"This sentiment may be the greatest threat to democracy in my lifetime.\" The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes , @NBCNews , @ABC , @CBS , @CNN ) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017 \nMeanwhile, around the country, Republican congressmen and senators are facing angry crowds at chaotic town hall meetings during this week's Presidents Day recess. \nConstituents are asking pointed questions about whether they'll stand up to Trump. \nAt the White House, press secretary Sean Spicer blamed Astroturfing — the technique of projecting a grassroots movement even when the protests are something other than spontaneous. \n\"Some people are clearly upset, but there is a bit of professional protester, manufactured base in there,\" he said. The Donald and the world \nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson and Homeland Security Secretary Michael Kelly arrived in Mexico on Wednesday. \nTo hear the White House tell it, their mission was to discuss and explain the president's border security plans and his latest orders involving deportation of unlawful immigrants, in the context of a thriving bilateral relationship. \nBut Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said his country would reject any U.S. policies imposed without consultation and agreement — including deportation from to Mexico of citizens of other countries, as proposed in memos unveiled by Kelly this week. \n\"I want to make it emphatically clear that neither Mexico's government or the Mexican people have any reason to accept provisions that have been unilaterally imposed by one government on the other,\" Videgaray said. \"We won't accept it because we don't have to.\" \nTillerson and Kelly are scheduled to meet Thursday with President Enrique Peña Nieto. \nSpicer insisted that the U.S.-Mexico relationship is \"phenomenal,\" even though Peña Nieto scrapped a visit to Washington last month in protest of Trump's proposal to build a border wall. \n\"We have a very healthy and robust relationship with the Mexican government, and Mexican officials and I think they would echo that same sentiment. President Peña Nieto has echoed that at well,\" Spicer told reporters at his daily briefing. \nBut Roberto Campa, head of the Mexican Interior Ministry's human rights department, called the plan to deport non-Mexicans to Mexico \"hostile\" and \"unacceptable.\" \nSo, let's call this relationship ... complicated. Tweeter in chief \nIt was a slow day on the president's Twitter accounts. He gave a shout out to the African American History Museum a day after his visit there. And he trolled Democrats with some faint praise for a liberal congressman, Keith Ellison, who's vying to become the party's next chairman. \nEllison is Muslim, which may have provided some subtext, given the uproar over Trump's attempt — blocked by federal courts — to cut off immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. One thing I will say about Rep. Keith Ellison, in his fight to lead the DNC, is that he was the one who predicted early that I would win! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 22, 2017 Second in command \nVice President Mike Pence donned work gloves and helped volunteers clean up after vandalism struck a St. Louis-area Jewish cemetery . He denounced the \"vile act\" during a visit to the Fenton Caterpillar facility, before going to the Chesed Shel Emeth Cemetery in University City with Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens. \nTrump has been criticized for a muted response to recent threats on Jewish community centers around the country, although he denounced Antisemitism on Tuesday as \"horrible\" and something that must end. Last month, the White House commemorated International Holocaust Remembrance Day but made no mention of Jews, which also drew criticism. \n\"We condemn this vile act of vandalism and those who perpetrate it in the strongest possible terms,\" Pence said in Missouri before visiting the cemetery. Coming and going \nA half-dozen White House aides with jobs involving national security failed FBI background checks and have been escorted off premises, Politico reported on Wednesday . The list includes White House Chief Digital Officer Gerrit Lansing, who ran the Republican National Convention's digital department last year, and the president's director of scheduling, Caroline Wiles. \nPolitico reported that Wiles resigned Friday before completion of the background check, which includes questions about credit and drug use.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:53:38.918+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
