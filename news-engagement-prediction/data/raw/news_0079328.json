It meant we didn’t get real track time until around 4pm, but after that we ran without issue. \n“The fixes we put in place cured the issues and we should be good to go tomorrow again.” Ricciardo ended up completing 46 laps in total across Day 1. Source: Getty Images \nRicciardo’s late running contained a best time of 1m22.926s to sit him fifth at the end of Day 1, a few tenths off his qualifying time for last year’s Spanish Grand Prix and 1.1 seconds off Lewis Hamilton’s quickest time of the day. \nAnd they have already started to iron out issues with the chassis. \n“From the first run, I went out there and it’s a new car, so you start to feel a few little differences,” Ricciardo said. “We’ve cleaned them up already in the few runs that we had. It’s just going to come with more running. \n“Sure you still have a look where the other cars are in testing but I don’t really read into it too much. If we’re two seconds quicker than everyone, then sure, I’d be pretty happy doing this interview right now. \n“We’re a bit more than a second off but you don’t know fuel loads or anything. \n“Considering the amount of laps we did today, we can be pretty positive about where we sit.” \nMax Verstappen takes over the Red Bull RB13 for the second and fourth days of the test, with Ricciardo back behind the wheel for the third day.
