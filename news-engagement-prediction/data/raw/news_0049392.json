VARANASI: When the state is in the poll mode, a new campaign -'Ramrajya Lao Abhiyan' (bring Ramrajya) is emerging in the parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi . But, it is not the work of saffron brigade (RSS or BJP). The campaign has been started by the seers and followers of Shankaracharya of Jyotir Math and Dwarka Peeth Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati . \"From today onwards we have started the membership of Ram Pariwar (Ram Pariwar ke sadasya) campaign. A facebook page of 'Ramrajya Lao Abhiyan' has also been created for this purpose, and people have started associating with our campaign,\" Shankaracharya's chief disciple and in-charge of Sri Vidya Math here Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati told to TOI on Monday. He is leading the campaign. These seers opening front against major political parties are supporting two independent candidates Sunil Kumar Shukla from Varanasi Cantt and Satish Kumar Agrahari from Varanasi South seats in the 2017 UP polls. The seers associated with Akhil Bharatiya Ramrajya Parishad Nyas took this decision because of the indifference shown by most political parties on police atrocities against them and innocent people during idol immersion in October 2015. With the slogan -\"Jaga Kashi ka swabhiman; Ramrajya lao abhiyan . Jago Kashivasiyo jao; Ramrajya lane ke liye khade ho jao. Akhir kab tak anyay sahoge?\" (Self pride of Kashi awoke to bring Ramrajya. Wake up people of Kashi, rise to bring Ramrajya. How long will you tolerate atrocity?), they began the membership campaign. \"We are not a political outfit, but a campaign to bring people together to end corruption, eliminate social imbalance and injustice, and stand against the bids of outraging the environment,\" said the seer adding that the poll manifesto of the campaign will be released on February 23. The objective of the campaign is to give a message to the ruling class and other major political parties that there is nothing bigger issue than the \"self-pride\" of Kashi. He said that the indifference shown by the chief minister has hurt Kashi's dignity. In police action many seers and devotees including Avimukteshwaranand were hurt at Godowlia crossing during idol immersion row. \"We strongly believe that the elected members of legislative assembly or Parliament should put people's grievances or issues of their respective constituencies freely in the house without the fear of party-whip. They should be accountable to the people who elected them, not the party high command. Unfortunately there is a veiled democracy in most political parties, and the elected members can't go against the high command. That's why we decided to support independent candidates to serve people's cause,\" he explained. Asked whether the concept of \"Ramrajya\" was literally similar to the Hindutva agenda of saffron outfits, Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati says, \"Absolutely not. We completely differ from RSS or BJP's definition of Hindutva. They speak about Hindu Rashtra, but we talk about Hindu (Sanatan) Dharma (religion) and Ramrajya. The BJP and RSS believe that they have the copyright or trademark of Hindutva, and they claim that they are the biggest party with over 10 crore members, but, what about rest of Hindus, whose population is 97 crore in the country as per 2011 census. Our campaign aims at bringing this vast chunk of Snatani Hindus under one umbrella.\"   All Comments () + ^ Back to Top Characters Remaining: 3000", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T18:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T17:49:44.597+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
