For the other sprinters, and the watching public, there are two more rounds remaining in this race for the fastmen. Cavendish has landed the first blow but the heavyweight contest is far from over. \nThe early skirmishes of the race were marked by a six-man break slipping clear. Manuele Mori (UAE Team Emirates), Artur Ershov (Gazprom-Rusvelo), David Lozano (Novo Nordisk), Artyom Zakharov (Astana), Mirco Maestri (Bardiani-CSF) and Kazushige Kuboki (Nippo-Vini Fantini) were afforded a healthy four-minute plus lead in the opening hours of action but with pan-flat course, and so many sprint trains willing and able to flex their muscles, there was little chance in an opportunist move succeeding. \nA series of falls took down Alex Dowsett (Movistar) and Juraj Sagan (Bora) but the entire peloton was breathing down the breakaway’s neck as the final 40 kilometres approached. \nWith 35 kilometres remaining only Zakharov, Kuboki, Mori remained out front, with their advantage teetering at just over a minute, a slim lead that evaporated quickly in the desert sun as Lotto Soudal and Quick-Step combined forces. \nThe catch made, Movistar hustled to the front in a bid to protect Nairo Quintana (Movistar) but there was no such response from Trek-Segafredo who saw Contador fall, with the Spaniard forced to chase on a teammate’s bike. \nContador made it back to the front of the bunch with 3,000 metres remaining but there would be no such luck for Kittel. The German looked to be well-positioned but a split in his leadout appeared to cause panic and with the road narrowing several riders on the left were forced wide. A touch of wheels, just as the bunch steamed through the flamme rouge, caught Kittel and several other riders. \nUp ahead, Dimension Data had both the numbers and the positioning to see out the victory. Greipel looked isolated as he moved into Cavendish’s slipstream but he was powerless as the Dimension Data rider opened for the line.
