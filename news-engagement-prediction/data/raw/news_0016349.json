Kyle Shanahan (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 7:12 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 7:12 p.m. ET \nNew 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan is leaning on people he knows to help fill out his staff, Sporting News' Alex Marvez reported Monday. \nShanahan, who officially took over in San Francisco hours after coaching for the Falcons in Super Bowl 51, has settled on three assistants, according to Marvez : the Buccaneers' Jon Embree (tight ends/assistant head coach), and Niners assistants Jeff Hafley (defensive backs) and Jason Tarver (unknown position). Shanahan worked with Hafley when the two were Browns assistants in 2014.Â He and Embree were assistants with the Redskins in 2010. \nMARVEZ: Mess from Falcons' worst loss ever not Shanahan's to clean up Â \nMarvez also reported Shanahan is \"targeting\" a pair of former Falcons colleagues: Jerome Henderson (co-defensive coordinator) and Mike McDaniel (wide receivers). Henderson would share DC duties with Chargers assistant Robert Saleh. Shanahan and Saleh were assistants with the Texans from 2006-09. \nSTEELE: Niners' hire of new GM Lynch proves owners make own rules \nThe Niners had settled on Shanahan long before Monday but waited until after the Super Bowl to announce his hire. He earned Sporting News' Coordinator of the Year award after leading the NFL's highest-scoring offense in the 2016 regular season. His play-calling in the Super Bowl came into question when Atlanta faltered badly late after taking a 28-3 lead against New England. Shanahan was criticized for being overly aggressive late in the game when a run-oriented attack likely would have secured a championship for the Falcons. \nAtlanta was outscored 31-0 from late in the third quarter through overtime and lost 34-28.
