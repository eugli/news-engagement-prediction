Hundreds of thousands of people angrily deleted the app, believing that Uber had weakened the New York taxi drivnald Trump's Muslim ban. A few days ers strike after Donald Trump 's Muslim ban. A few days later, responding to the popular pushback, and Silicon Valley's own strong pro-immigration sentiment, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick stepped down from President Trump's economic advisory council. \n\nDonald Trump makes one thing obvious: this is the age of the viral consumer boycott . If some companies have lined up behind Trump, campaigns like #grabyourwallet try to scapegoat brands that the Trump family profits from. \n\nWe've had our own social media tizzies, here in India. If you hashtagged #noAmazon, after discovering that the site hosted anti-national doormats, or if you were one of those who swarmed upon Snapdeal, forcing them to drop Aamir Khan as an endorser because he spoke of a new intolerance, you know that heady feeling of having participated. Boycotts can make a company bend. \n\nBut these days, we aren't holding companies to account for their business practices, but for their branding missteps, their CEO's political ties, and random unwitting errors. We're asking them to share our values. This is both asking too much and too little of them. \n\nBoycotts aren't new, but their history has had distinct phases. From the European cloth bonfires of our own swadeshi movement to the British rejection of slaveproduced sugar, to the way the world registered its disgust with apartheid and landgrabs by refusing South African or Israeli stuff, popular boycotts have given teeth to historic struggles. \n\nIn the '80s and '90s, consumer boycotts really took off in the West, targeting global companies for their environment and labour practices. Giants like Nike, McDonalds, Shell and others were exposed and shunned.Their own branding promises boomeranged on them, and often, bothered by the bad publicity , shareholders drove changes. It's because of those skirmishes that corporations do better PR now, sometimes coopting activism. Goody-goody brands like Body Shop and Whole Foods took off, and there was a flurry of product labels attesting to ecological and fair-trade practices.It's clear that boycotts were effective often enough. \n\nThat's because they were professional, committed operations that identified a clear problem and mobilised action. Now, any injured individual can start and scale a campaign on social media. It costs nothing to add your voice to the clamour. It fizzles out just as easily .; it's so easy to emote against a company that one forgets to organise, or even study the sustainability of the boycott. It's just about expressing a passing pique -like I boycotted Burger Singh for its bloodthirsty bad-taste discounts after the surgical strikes, Nando's after its sexist “breasts and thighs“ ad. But I was acting up, not taking action. \n\nUnsurprisingly , these pinpricks seldom hurt their targets. Many fired-up Indian patriots tried to boycott Chinese goods after the Uri attacks, seemingly to protest China's support of Pakistan. Now, that was clearly a campaign headed nowhere -most of us are unlikely to pass up a good deal, and it would barely scrape China's exports in any case. Whatever the reasons, culture or economics, very few Indians base their buying decisions on vague statements of virtue. Even Patanjali's success doesn't come from a nationalist “buycott“ as much as value for money . \n\nSome young, better-off Indians also pour their political passions into the marketplace. They instinctively relate to what Americans call “voting with your dollars“ -that is, buying the change they wish to see in the world. They take brands personally , their shopping choices are part of their identity . \n\nCompanies actively wanted this identification to happen, they wanted their brands to have a consciousness, a clear personality . But now, American companies caught in the political crossfire over Trump are dealing with the dark side of this personalisation. The boycotts cut both ways. For instance, Starbucks is being boycotted by the pro-Trump crowd because it announced its plan to hire more refugees. \n\nBut really , what's the point of displacing our political powerlessness into an irrational war on companies for their seeming stances? It is one thing to call out instances of collusion between politics and business, but it's wholly another to hate on a brand for not being sympatico with your causes. And in fact, such reactions obscure the real issues -how a company does its business, how it treats its workers and serves its consumers, plays by the rules of a competitive market, how accountable it is. \n\nSo let's not kid ourselves about our power as consumers. If you think of boycotts as emotional expression against companies, you will only get skin-deep responses from them. If you want to make a real change, you need strategy and patience, not twitchy tweeting fingers.
