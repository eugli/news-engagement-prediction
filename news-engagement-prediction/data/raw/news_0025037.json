Massie Bill Would Abolish Education Deptment posted by Mike Lindeman - share \n(Washington, DC) -- A northern Kentucky congressman has introduced a bill to abolish the U.S. Department of Education. Representative Thomas Massie filed the bill as the Senate approved Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education. Massie's proposal is one sentence, stating that the Department of Education shall terminate at the end of 2018. He says the department has an annual budget of $70 billion and districts rely on federal funding for about 15% of their budgets. The congressman argues that federal taxes for the department can be better collected and appropriated by local representatives. His bill has 7 co-sponsors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T01:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:06:32.293+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
