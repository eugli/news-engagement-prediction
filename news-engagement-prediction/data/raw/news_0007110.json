Gregg Popovich (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 10:59 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 10:59 p.m. ET \nOnce again, Gregg Popovich is speaking out on social issues in America, this time in the context of Black History Month. Something he said Thursday will spark the usual inflamed exchanges when race comes up. \nSTEELE: NBA, unlike NFL, not shying away from Trump talk \nAs part of a lengthy answer to a question about what the month-long commemoration means to him, the Spurs coach said this: \"If you were born white, you automatically have a monstrous advantage educationally, economically, culturally in this society and all the systemic roadblocks that exist, whether it's in a judicial sense, a neighborhood sense with laws, zoning education, we have huge problems in that regard that are very complicated, but take leadership, time and real concern to try to solve. It's a tough one because people don't really want to face it.\" \nThe rest of Popovich's response (as transcribed by ESPN.com's Michael C. Wright) was just as pointed. Prior to the above statement, he called idea that minorities have the same access to the American Dream as whites \"hogwash.\" Black History Month itself, he said, was America's \"national sin.\" Later, he said President Donald Trump tried to \"illegitimize\" former President Barack Obama with birther claims. \nMORE: Popovich rips into Trump over immigration ban \nPop's words come from a place of knowing people of color as, well, people, as human beings worthy of dignity and respect. But when he and other people touch the third rail of \"white privilege,\" people go off the rails. Dignity is immolated and respect incinerated by the sparks that ignite all around. Screamers on all sides are cocksure they're saving the country and that all dissenters are evil. The \"discourse\" causes people to withdraw, to not risk hurt feelings or, worse, physical injury as people protect their racial turf. \nPopovich sees no value in remaining silent. \n\"It always intrigues me when people come out with, 'I'm tired of talking about that' or, 'Do we have to talk about race again?' And the answer is, 'You're damned right we do,'\" he told Wright. \nAnd because he went there Thursday, to white privilege, get ready for another conflagration.
