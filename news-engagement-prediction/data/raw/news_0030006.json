Picture: Mark Scott Richard Noone Central Coast Gosford Express Advocate Share Share on Twitter \nA P-PLATER who travelled 200km/h in the breakdown lane with cannabis in his system before ploughing into another vehicle — sending it crashing over a guardrail — later giggled to police “it worked, it got rid of the car”. \nKayden James Lawson was sentenced today to four years’ jail with a non-parole period of just two years and six months following the shocking collision at 6.48am on November 10, 2014. \nDash cam footage tendered in Gosford District Court shows the moment his Holden Commodore passes a northbound truck before the 22-year-old slammed into the rear of a Toyota Hilux sending it smashing through a guard rail and plummeting 10m off a bridge to an embankment below. The Toyota Hilux was shunted off a bridge on the M1 at Morisset, trapping the driver.
