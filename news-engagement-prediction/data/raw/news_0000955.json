He can lead a protest. I’m leading a country.” \nCorbyn devoted his entire allocation of questions to Trump and US relations, beginning: “At last week’s prime minister’s question time, the prime minister told the house, I’m not afraid to speak frankly to the president of the United States. What happened?” \nMay replied: “I was able to build on the relationship that we have with our most important ally, and to get some very significant commitments from President Trump.” \nAsked whether she had prior notice of the travel ban, which has prompted protests and condemnation, May said she had not, adding her strongest personal criticism yet of the plan. \n“On the policy that President Trump has introduced, this is government is clear that that policy is wrong,” the prime minister said. “We wouldn’t do it. In six years as home secretary I never introduced such a policy. We believe it is divisive and wrong.” \nPraising the UK’s record on settling refugees, she added: “The question is how you respond. The job of government is not to chase the headlines. The job of government is not to take to the streets in protest. The job of government is to protect the interests of British citizens. And that’s exactly what we did.” \nCorbyn asked the prime minister whether access to the NHS for US healthcare firms was offered up as a “bargaining chip” for a new trade deal. May replied, to cheers from her MPs: “The NHS is not for sale and it never will be.” \nThe Labour leader ended by noting Trump’s travel ban, his stated intention to quit climate change deals, his defence of torture and dubious record on women’s rights. \nHe asked, referring to a petition against the state visit : “Just what more does President Trump have to do before the prime minister will listen to the 1.8 million people who’ve already called for his state visit invitation to be withdrawn?” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T20:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T15:22:49.097+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
