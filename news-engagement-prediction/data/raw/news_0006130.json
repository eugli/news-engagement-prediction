Sure, they both share a nicely energetic buddy chemistry that resonates in some scenes. But for the most part, this is all just one big product placement plug that truly offers nothing new in terms of humor. Vaughn and Wilson essentially star as a pair of unemployed watch salesmen who apply for internships at a \"certain multinational Internet-related corporation\" and soon find themselves competing against a variety of ambitious millennials for permanent jobs. At the same time, there's a flimsy romantic subplot between Wilson's character and an attractive female executive (Rose Byrne) that easily goes nowhere. Clocking in at a whopping two hours, the flick is mostly packed with overlong scenes of our two dimwitted heroes attempting to work together with a team of underdog misfits in a series of silly challenges, all the while trying to win themselves a brand new set of occupations. It doesn't help that all-star cameos from the likes of John Goodman and Will Ferrell add nothing to the film and are simply used to pad on more minutes than needed. The fact of the matter is, the whole thing is just one big, bland, entirely repetitive mess. Vaughn and Wilson try their best to make the utterly lazy material work with their comic chemistry and easygoing interplay, but to no avail. All in all, this is nothing more than a two-hour-long commercial with a story full of predictable shenanigans, corny sentimentality, and just a few solid laughs. Unless you genuinely enjoy by-the-numbers comedies, this isn't a must-see. At the very least, it's simply worth a one-time rent, but nothing more. The Internship by CJMOVIES This might tick some people off, but I liked it better than \"Wedding Crashers.\" The jokes may be hit & miss, but they still work. The supporting characters are more mature than the ones from that film, and I love the look of this film. üòçüòçüòçüòç", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T17:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T13:32:01.430+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
