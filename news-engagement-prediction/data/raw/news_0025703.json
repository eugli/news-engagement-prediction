And it seems the I Should Be So Lucky singer chose her family, with reports she kicked her fiance out of her London home around Christmas, leaving him to move back in with his parents. Concerns: It's understood parents Ron and Carol were concerned the 29-year-old actor was using the 49-year-old singer for fame Strained relationship: Dannii's dislike of Joshua was straining their close relationship The singer confirmed the split via Instagram last month, thanking fans for their support, saying: 'Thank you now for your love and understanding with the news that Josh and I have decided to go our separate ways. 'We wish only the best for each other as we venture towards new horizons,' she added. Earlier this month, entertainment reporter Peter Ford told the Kyle and Jackie O Show on Australian breakfast radio the family, 'They're celebrating! They're thrilled! He was bad news.' 'Relief is the word. They always had concerns. Dannii is like a sniffer dog. She can suss out a bulls**t artist anywhere and she did not like him,' Peter said. Done!

The engagement is said to have ended over rumours that Joshua had gotten close to actress Marta Milans And it appears Dannii's concerns might not have been unfounded with the actor being spotted cosying up to a mystery woman just weeks after getting engaged to the pop princess. Most recently it's claimed the actor was getting 'close' to Spanish actress Marta Milans, on the set of their US TV show No Tomorrow. Adding more fuel to the fire were claims Joshua lied about not knowing who Kylie Minogue was when the pair first met on the set of TV show Galavant. No longer supporting the cause: The couple put their 2016 engagement on hold to campaign for marriage equality in Australia with the Say I Do Down Under movement - a campaign Joshua has now abandoned His Galavant co-star Vinnie Jones recently revealed Joshua purposely moved into Kylie's hotel before she arrived for her guest role on the show. It's understood Joshua told Kylie all guest stars have dinner with the star of the series - him. Kylie and Joshua began dating in September 2015 before announcing their engagement in February 2016. However, the couple put their wedding on hold to campaign for marriage equality in Australia with the Say I Do Down Under movement - a campaign Joshua has now abandoned.
