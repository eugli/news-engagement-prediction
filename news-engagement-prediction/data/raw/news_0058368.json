It's safe to say most of us will take sex in whatever position we can get it, but most dudes have an affinity for doggy-style. In fact, one survey recently declared it the most popular sex position — among both men and women . And what's not to love? It's intimate, primal and you can thrust deep to hit all the right spots —\"getting all up in them guts,\" if you want to be romantic about it. \nThat's why it's particularly odd that one writer (a lady) for The Frisky has unilaterally decided that men \"Aren't That Into Doggy-Style\" — seemingly without consulting any men on the subject, no less. Let's see if her claims have any merit. \n1. It's hard on the knees \nIf you’re on all fours and your man is right behind you on his knees for a long period of time, his knees are getting the blues. \nWait, where are you having this doggy-style sex that it's so painful on the knees? I typically screw on my bed, which has a nice pillowtop that's very kind to my knees, as you'd expect a bed to be. If your knees are so sensitive that they can't handle a few minutes of tender jackhammering, then you are WEAK and SOFT and nobody wants to have sex with you anyway. \n2. Rug Burns \nYou may like to get it on, on the floor because it makes it easier to balance yourselves. But if your floor is covered in carpet, you knees will end up burning like sh*t. \nAgain with the knees? Look, no one's saying that sex on the floor isn't all it's cracked up to be, precisely because of the carpet issues. But how often are you really having sex on the floor? Like, I can see wanting to pound one out when Fixer Upper goes to commercial break (not a bad idea, tbh), but might we suggest the couch? Or a table? \n3. Minute Man \nBecause he has control of motion and movement, things can start to feel really good. So good that he may come within seconds. \nI don't know about you, but I have in fact had sex before, on at least two occasions. Anyone who knows anything about sex knows that obviously you don't go with doggy as your opening salvo. You gotta work up to it, and maybe even save it for the crescendo if it really does tickle your fancy that much. Again, her problem is not with the position, but with the misuse of the position. \n(And to be fair, there are plenty of guys who like it for this exact reason) \n4. Not So Rhythmic \nThe most important thing to have when having sex is rhythm. And sometimes when doing it doggy-style, rhythm is super lacked. Guys get way too excited because it feels so good, and ladies, you know it’s kinda hard to keep your balance while getting pounded from behind. \nWell, says who? Rhythm is pretty subjective, or at the very least there are many different rhythms to be found in sex. A slow, sensual grinding in either missionary or cowgirl is one type of rhythm. A vigorous pounding in doggy-style is another, equally-valid rhythm. It's all about changing it up and doing the right things at the right time. Rougher, more aggressive sex has its time and place just like anything else. \n5. Noises… Ew \nLet’s talk queefs. I know, it’s embarrassing, but it’s real as hell. In fact, when he hears it, he’s not the most turned on. \nFirst of all, let's not talk queefs — we know they're happening and that they're natural. Enough said. If anything, a few errant queefs are a sign that you're getting after it and have, in fact, reached the summit of F*ck Mountain. It's not as though we, as men, are strangers to making gross noises , so this is hardly a reason to abandon an entire sex position. Also, don't offhandedly dismiss queefing as a turn-on. I've seen some shit on reddit, man. \nIn summation, doggy-style is rad. Drop This Fact \nYet another survey found that doggy style was the most-hated position — but only by women.
