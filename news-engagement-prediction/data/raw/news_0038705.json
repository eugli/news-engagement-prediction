Written submissions are also being accepted. The deadline for both the survey and written submissions is April 30. \nREAD MORE : Alberta carbon tax kicks in: ‘It’s already here, we can’t do anything about it’ \nMinister of Indigenous Relations Richard Feehan says the indigenous community has long showed themselves to be passionate advocates for the environment. \n“Indigenous people have always been environmental stewards and are on the frontline of climate change. Our government is committed to involving indigenous people in all aspects of Alberta’s Climate Leadership Program which will create good jobs and diversify Alberta’s economy,” he said. \nThe province says some revenue collected from the carbon levy will go towards supporting indigenous communities in participating in climate leadership initiatives. \nIt will fund programs and services that assist indigenous communities and organizations in order to: reduce greenhouse gas emissions; generate green jobs; lower costs from burning fossil fuels. \nAccording to the government, the survey and written submissions are part of a broad engagement with indigenous leadership and communities. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T01:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T07:11:37.798+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
