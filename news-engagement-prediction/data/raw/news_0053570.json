Reports now indicate that Donald Trump ‘s White House is g earing up to change that. \nReactions vary, but the opposition to this likely move is very strong. . @realdonaldtrump will go down as most divisive president in history. Plan to attack trans kids is beyond the pale. https://t.co/9XoXlJ6ssy \n— Chad Griffin (@ChadHGriffin) February 22, 2017 Trump is going after trans kids today. Rescinding Obama’s era guidance that permits trans kids to use the goddamn bathroom. #ButHerEmails \n— Imani Gandy (@AngryBlackLady) February 21, 2017 There it is. LGB folks, Trump is not protecting any of us if he attacks queer & trans friends. Do not stand for this. https://t.co/cxAKIzfYnw \n— Rachel Stark (@syntactics) February 22, 2017 Educators haven’t “struggled to understand” guidance on respecting trans students. They *asked* for this policy. https://t.co/PUDvsxTlJF \n— Alexandra Brodsky (@azbrodsky) February 22, 2017 Reports that Trump Admin will rescind trans student protections. Shocking this kind of harm would even be subject of debate. #LoveTrumpsHate", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:14:51.391+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
