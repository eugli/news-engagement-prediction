I had no memory of it.'\nThe court heard the cuddle may have been enough to spark the act of sexsomnia so soon after returning from being in a warzone.\nThe woman went to police three years later after her night with Atila brought back memories of being sexually assaulted as a child.\nShe broke down in tears when the jury returned a not guilty verdict after 1 hour and 20 minutes.\nMerthyr Tydfil Crown Court (pictured) heard Atilla knew the woman before he volunteered for a six-month tour of duty in Helmand Province\nJudge Richard Twomlow said the evidence was some of the 'most unusual' ever heard in a courtroom.\nAtilla, of Northampton, had a 'distinguished career' during 26 years in the Royal Logistics Corps where he was a Warrant Officer.\nBut he stayed on as a reservist and volunteered to go to Afghanistan in late 2012 supporting the SAS. He also worked with the United Nations Peacekeeping Force.\nIn a testimonial to the court his commanding officer Lt Col Michael Crawley said: 'He was engaged in an exceptionally challenging task with Special Forces in Afghanistan.\n'He has terrier like determination and was our go-to person who can achieve anything he sets his mind to.\n'He is utterly reliable - I trust him implicitly.'", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T19:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T19:53:52.324+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
