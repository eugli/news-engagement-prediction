I love the country, yet I was being made to feel like a criminal. \n\"I had bought my ticket and checked in and was about to get on the flight when I was stopped by two officials. I thought, 'What is happening here?' \n\"They told me there was a visa problem and a red flag had come up against my name because of an Iranian stamp in my passport. I went there to play in a legends match to open a stadium and didn't even stay overnight. \n\"The two officials told me if I got on the flight, I would simply be deported back to Qatar once I arrived in the States. \n\"I tried to explain I didn't even live in Qatar and was just trying to get to my home in the Caribbean.\" \nLast month, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order temporarily banning people from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen entering the country. \nYorke won three Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FA Cup with United and also played in England for Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers, Birmingham City and Sunderland.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T23:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:57:17.195+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
