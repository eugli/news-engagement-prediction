My son would be sorely tempted to trade in his iPhone. https://t.co/g6jplGWhh8 pic.twitter.com/RcVBrR2NWu \n— mala bhargava (@malabhargava) February 15, 2017 Am here for the nokia 3310 as my 3rd phone. Will carry them all at once😂😂 \n— Bad Presidential❤ (@Audrianna011) February 15, 2017 \nDetails on the alleged re-release are scarce. \nThe HMD Global Oy, the Finnish manufacturer that bought the rights to market phones under the Nokia brand from Microsoft, will reportedly launch a \"modern version\" of 3310 at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona this month. According to the report, the phone will be launched on Feb. 26 and will cost only €59 ($63). \nHowever, the burning question: will the new 3310 contain the legendary Snake game? Twitter certainly hopes so: I'll buy the Nokia 3310 just for the Snake game \n— Samiya Daud (@thamiyah) February 15, 2017 @AlexisYoungxox how is that old nokia 3310 going? 😂😂😂 pic.twitter.com/pOQWsefMX4 \n— 🥃🍸Mr L🍸🥃 (@toyburu2) February 15, 2017 The Nokia 3310 is coming back!
