In time, they will be subject to legal challenges, which I hope and expect will significantly blunt their impact. \nHowever, I doubt that the overreach of these policies are entirely lost on Trump. Rather, I suspect that he is less concerned about the reality of implementing his policies than he is about the fear they are sowing in immigrant communities and the iron fist self-perception he is so desperately trying to cultivate. By both of those measures, the policies announced this week are wild successes. \nIn the 15 years I have represented immigrants facing deportation in New York City, I have never seen the level of panic that is gripping our immigrant communities. Fielding a deluge of calls from panicked immigrants is now a regular part of my day, as it is for immigrant advocates across the city and across the nation. \nIt is easy to understand the fear. The policies are too numerous to survey exhaustively but a few examples suffice to demonstrate their overreach. \nFor years, various administrations have advanced priorities directing that enforcement resources be targeted at immigrants with certain designated categories of convictions. One memo issued this week, and the executive order upon which it is based, purport to impose revised \"priorities.\" \nThe new \"priorities\" include not only anyone convicted of any crime, not matter how minor, but also anyone charged with a crime (so much for the presumption of innocence), or deemed by an immigration agent, not a judge, to have committed a crime (so much for due process). \nAs a result, when I got a call this week from Rosa, who entered the United States unlawfully 11 years ago fleeing brutal gang violence in Honduras, I could no longer give her my standard assurance that she was not a priority for deportation. As a crime, unlawful entry makes her — like the vast majority of undocumented immigrants — now a priority for deportation, even though she has never been charged or convicted. \nA stroke of Trump’s pen cannot, of course, change the reality that there are estimated to be over 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. While we already spend more on immigration enforcement than on all other federal law enforcement combined, immigration agencies can only realistically deport a small fraction of that population. \nThat means that instead of a targeted enforcement strategy, Trump has directed a shotgun style dragnet enforcement approach focused on any immigrant who an agent believes is \"in violation of the immigration laws.\" Thus, despite the rhetoric, the new policy is focused more on sowing broad fear in immigrant communities than it is in actually addressing any public safety threat. \nIt gets worse for Rosa. Trump has also directed an unprecedented (and unconstitutional) expansion of extra-judicial deportation mechanisms. The new memos dictate that if immigration agents encounter an undocumented immigrant who cannot prove that they have been in the United States for at least two years, they will not even be given the opportunity to see a judge. Rather, an immigrant agent can singlehandedly issue a largely unreviewable deportation order. \nImagine what our criminal justice system would look like if a beat police officer could not only make an arrest, but could also convict and sentence someone unilaterally. I advised Rosa that she should carry proof of her long term residence at all times. \nBut deportation is not all that Rosa has to worry about. Two years ago, when her son turned 12, the local gang in Honduras tried to recruit him. When he resisted, he was beaten and death threats followed. Terrified, she used her meager savings to pay smugglers to bring him to her in the United States. \nTrump's new order directs that parents like Rosa, who help their children escape life-threatening violence, are to be criminally prosecuted for human trafficking \"regardless of the desires for family reunification, or conditions in other countries.\" \nImmigration is and will be the leading edge of a larger stress test for American democracy. It is incumbent upon us all to stand steadfastly with immigrant communities. Make no mistake: Unless checked here, Trump's hostility to these core pillars of our constitutional democracy will bleed into all of our lives. \nMoskowitz is professor of law and director of the Kathryn O.
