Currently, it’s pouring about 50 billion tons of ice into the ocean each year, and scientists believe this rate could continue to increase in the future. Altogether, the glacier has the potential to raise global sea levels by an estimated two feet. \nScientists’ concern stems largely from the glacier’s interaction with the ocean, which laps against the exposed front of the floating ice shelf and also travels deep beneath it. Warming ocean waters can cause glaciers to melt from the bottom up, making them less stable and more likely to break. \nIn fact, Pine Island Glacier has experienced several significant calving events — that’s when an iceberg breaks off from the ice shelf — in recent years. In 2015, the glacier lost a massive iceberg with an area of more than 200 square miles. \nThe most recent event, which was captured via satellite imagery at the end of January, is small in comparison — NASA scientists estimate that the area of ice lost only spans a square mile or so. But the event speaks to the fact that the glacier is still melting and breaking. \n“I think this event is the calving equivalent of an ‘aftershock’ following the much bigger event,” said Ian Howat, a glaciologist at Ohio State University, in a recent statement . “Apparently, there are weaknesses in the ice shelf – just inland of the rift that caused the 2015 calving – that are resulting in these smaller breaks.” Related Logbooks kept by Ernest Shackleton, Robert Scott show Antarctic sea ice levels barely changed over 100 years \nIndeed, scientists have previously observed multiple small rifts in the ice that they believe could lead to more calving events in the future. \nThe incident comes as the future of the agency’s climate research grows increasingly uncertain. Last November, just after President Donald Trump was elected, one of his campaign advisers shocked the climate science community by suggesting that the new administration should curtail NASA climate research activities. \nAnd now, the issue has cropped up again in a hearing conducted last Thursday by the House Committee on Science, Space & Technology. At the hearing, committee chair Lamar Smith reportedly stated that he’d like to see a “rebalancing” at NASA, and later told E&E News that he’d like the agency to focus more on space exploration, while other agencies can focus on earth sciences and climate change. (On the space front, NASA researchers were part of a broader team that just discovered a striking group of seven exoplanets orbiting close to a nearby sun, all of which are in an Earth-like temperature range.) \nWhile it’s true that other federal agencies are also instrumental players when it comes to U.S. climate science, NASA’s satellite observations give the agency a unique and likely irreplaceable role when it comes to climate research. NASA data have been used in everything from constructing global temperature records to monitoring ice melt at the poles and recording events like the recent calving at Pine Island. Experts have noted that cutting the agency’s earth sciences research could be devastating not only for U.S. scientists, but for climate researchers all over the world.
