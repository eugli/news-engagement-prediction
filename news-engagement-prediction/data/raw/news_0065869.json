A strike by ASPIRA teachers would be the first at a charter school anywhere in the country.\nThe strike vote was prompted by what the union called a “lack of transparency and accountability in finances and foundering leadership at the network’s most senior levels, threatening conditions in classrooms.”\nASPIRA teachers said they blame the network’s struggles solely on board chairman Fernando Grillo, who has been in charge for seven years.\n“In the last 6 weeks alone, the charter network’s CEO and Chief Academic Officer have been removed, only one principal who started the school year remains in that position, and the system’s COO — who had essentially been running the charter school network — recently resigned,” the teacher’s union said in a statement Monday.\nGrillo, in a statement posted on the ASPIRA website, said the board has been negotiating with teachers since Spring 2016 and “the only item that remains unsolved is salaries.”\n“We want to make one thing perfectly clear: Nothing is more important that the education of our students and we continue to stand ready, willing and able to negotiate at a moment’s notice,” he said.\nLast year, Chicago’s UNO network of charter schools narrowly avoided a strike, just days after the Chicago Teachers Union reached an agreement with Chicago Public Schools that averted the union’s second strike since 2012.\nPreviously from Politics Obama could be a highway star — but should it be I-55 or I-294?
