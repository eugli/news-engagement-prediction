Reuters 8 Saido Berahino was suspended by the FA after failing a drugs test in September \nIn his defence with the FA, Berahino explained his personal situation and the fact he had suffered depression due to weight issues and had also turned to drink. \nThe forward is understood to have received help and advice from the West Brom and the FA. \nThe striker received the suspension before his £15million move to Stoke last month for testing positive for recreational drug MDMA - which can be taken pure - in an out-of-competition test. Getty 8 MDMA can be taken pure or found in ecstasy tablets \nBerahino, who made his Stoke debut on Wednesday night, did not make a single appearance for West Brom between September 10 and his transfer to the Potters last week. \nAnd he also failed to appear for the Under-23 team for three months. \nKeep up to date with ALL the West Brom and Stoke City news, gossip, transfers and goals on our club pages plus fixtures, results and live match commentary \nBaggies boss Tony Pulis admitted today that Berahino DID serve an eight-week suspension while at West Brom - but refused to discuss the matter further. \nBut following Berahino's move last week, Pulis said the striker needed to \"get his act together\". \nThe shock revelations will have no impact on his transfer to Stoke, who were made fully aware of the situation prior to the completion of the deal. \nThe news has only just come to light because the FA have a policy of not making the names of those found guilty of doping offences that are not regulated by WADA public.
