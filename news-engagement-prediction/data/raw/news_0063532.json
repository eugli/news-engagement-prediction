What’s changed, as far as you’re concerned? \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The questions I’ve been getting from the San Francisco media are different than the questions I got in 2014. It’s a lefty town, but among the interviewers, there’s a sense that Chelsea Manning got off, that it’s unfair, that it was unjust she didn’t serve what I think is this completely unjust sentence of 35 years for a victimless crime. The suggestion is “you’re obligated to tell both sides of the story,” and that’s very reductive to me. And I wasn’t getting those questions in New York and L.A. Was that because there was more support for WikiLeaks among a left-leaning audience three years ago? I don’t know if there was a broad support for WikiLeaks in 2014 in Brooklyn. But Chelsea Manning as a person was sort of forgotten then. That was the height of everyone talking about [Edward] Snowden . People talking about “The Source” would always bring up Snowden.

Opera, that was three weeks before the election, and WikiLeaks was totally persona non grata with Democrats, of course. But the piece seemed to even make more sense. Because it’s not about WikiLeaks in a simple way. I’m interested to see what it’s like in San Francisco, because her sentence has been commuted. Manning is a much more famous person now, among both liberals and conservatives. Her divisiveness has just gone up. But I didn’t change the text to reflect any change in current events. It’s not about that. The piece was about my interaction with these topics — the Iraq war logs, Chelsea Manning — at the time I wrote it. With any work, it’s this conversation between the circumstances it was created in and circumstances of the time and place it’s being seen. That conversation makes it meaningful or not. Why did you write it? It took such a long time to write this piece. I was initially interested in it before Chelsea Manning was a person anyone knew. I was interested in WikiLeaks, F.O.I. [Freedom of Information] activism, sampling, the digitalization of music. There was a New Yorker profile on Julian Assange in 2010, so I was interested in that.
