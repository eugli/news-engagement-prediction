The confetti falls and history is made. One team is declared Super Bowl champion, etched into the record books, while the other has to watch on, knowing what could have been. \nThere have been close fought Super Bowls, like two years ago when the New England Patriots snatched victory - quite literally - with a last-minute interception. \nOthers have been more one-sided, but however you win, the moment is there to be savoured. \nBut in the euphoria of victory, just how much do players remember? Does it stay with them forever, or is it a hazy memory, pieced together through replays and recollections? \nOver the year, Sky Sports asked a number of Super Bowl winners about their achievement, and what they remember about the game itself, but particularly that 'Super Bowl feeling'. Don't know who to support in the Super Bowl? Our quiz may help you decide! Building up \nFor players not familiar with Super Bowl week, it can be an overwhelming experience. Media obligations and dealing with ticket requests for friends and family, there can be a lot of plates to juggle. \nEmmanuel Sanders has made two Super Bowls in his seven-year career, and compared the two different experiences. New England Patriots v Atlanta Falcons NFL Super Bowl LI February 5, 2017, 10:00pm Get Sky Sports Get a Sky Sports pass \n\"It's not a distraction, you have to enjoy the moment and embrace it. In my first Super Bowl (with the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2010), I couldn't relax because we were playing against Aaron Rodgers, and you're taking care of family, a lot of chaos. \n\"But the second time (a victory in 2015 with the Denver Broncos), I really learned to embrace it, because I knew then it doesn't happen every year.\" Broncos wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders was able to enjoy his second trip to the Super Bowl \nCarolina Panthers outside linebacker Thomas Davis said that, despite the hype surrounding the game, it is important to enjoy the opportunity. Despite breaking his arm in the Panthers' conference win, Davis returned two weeks later for Super Bowl 50. \n\"Not a chance I was missing that game. Once the doctors said it was possible I could play, that's all I needed to hear. I took full advantage of everything I could to make it happen. \n\"You just take it all in, and really enjoy that moment. That's what it's all about, but don't allow it be a distraction. Focus on your work when you have to, and enjoy the down time when you can.\" Thomas Davis broke his arm two weeks before Super Bowl 50, but made it back to play in the game \nChris Harris Jr. , another member of the Broncos team that found success last year, agreed that having a relaxed attitude was the best policy. \n\"The week before is all about juggling tonnes of family and studying, but it's a fun week, for sure.\" \nFor Kevin Boothe , two-time Super Bowl winner with the New York Giants, it was the build-up - the last regular season game in 2007 - when it started to become apparent that the Giants could go all the way. \n\"We were fortunate enough to play the New England Patriots last. We lost by three points, but knew that we could beat them. The Patriots were unbeaten, and we were right there with them. That definitely propelled us going forward into the play-offs.\" \nGreg Jennings added:\"One of the most memorable moments was not the Super Bowl itself, but when we beat the Eagles, on the road in Philadelphia. We knew we had Atlanta, but we were training like we'd already beaten them.\" The immediate emotion \nMany of the players felt relief, and a sense of historic achievement that could never be taken away from them. \n\"You look around at the players you went to battle with, and there's a sense of pride\", said Osi Umenyiora , two-time Super Bowl winner with the New York Giants. \n\"Records will be broken, teams will win and lose but nobody can ever take this away from you, and there's no better feeling I've experienced. Offensive lineman Kevin Boothe won two Vince Lombardi trophies in a nine-year career \n\"That's why we play the game, to win a Championship\", said Boothe. \"To achieve that success at the highest level of your sport is something, to this day, that still doesn't seem real.\" \nMemories vary from player to player, depending on their experience level and role in the game. Boothe talked about how he made the mistake of leaving the field early. \n\"The first Super Bowl I remember vividly, being out on the field and I didn't know how to celebrate! Everybody is running around, but I actually went back to the locker room. Nobody arrives for five minutes, and I realise that maybe I shouldn't have come in, so I head back out and the celebrations continued!\" Von Miller was named MVP when the Broncos beat the Panthers in Super Bowl 50 \nMeanwhile, Super Bowl 50 MVP Von Miller still gets excited when he recalls the moment. \n\"I get goosebumps thinking about it. We worked so hard all year long, and to share it with your team-mates, coaches and family, there's really nothing like that. \nFor Umenyiora, the two experiences were very different. \n\"The first time, in 2007, I remember it clearly - not knowing what to do, what to think, and for the next three-four hours I just wandered round in a complete daze. \nShaun Gayle , Sky Sports pundit and Super Bowl winner with the '85 Chicago Bears, called the moment \"surreal\". \n\"You try to take a second, block out everything and gather your thoughts. What an accomplishment this is, for one, short time in your life to be the best,\" he said. \n\"You share it with your team-mates, the same guys you go through the training, injuries, and difficulties and you fight towards the same goal. They'll put that up there with their marriage, first-born child as an event with so much meaning.\" \n\"Oddly enough, the second one I don't remember anything about that. It's like we won, and then a week later I don't remember the feeling, or anything about it.\" Demaryius Thomas has played in two Super Bowls, both with the Denver Broncos \nSanders simply called it \"the greatest feeling in the world\", while team-mate Demaryius Thomas called it \"hands down the best moment of my life\". \nEven at 38, New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees was still motivated to repeat the achievement. \n\"At the end of the day, all you want to do is lift up that Vince Lombardi trophy, and you can call yourself a world champion. That was in my ninth year, I'm now in my 17th, and I'd like to get another one.\" Making history \n\"Every Super Bowl is history\", said Miller. \"I think instantly you feel that lifelong bond with your team-mates that you achieved the impossible.\" Bobby Wagner (right) celebrated victory with Richard Sherman \nBobby Wagner was part of the Seahawks team that delivered Seattle its first Super Bowl. \n\"It's an amazing feeling, one you can't describe. For me, the best moment was the parade, celebrating with the fans who have supported you all the way. Especially for us, bringing the first one to the city, it was a great feeling. \n\"I feel like we'll be remembered forever, because we brought the first one, and hopefully it's one of many.\" Building up to Super Bowl LI, we take a look back at the pick of the plays from each Super Bowl. The other side \nFor every winner, there has to be a loser. Davis talked about the ultimate disappointment of coming up short on the biggest stage. \n\"It was miserable but we didn't play well enough as a team. It was very disappointing after a great season to come up short in the Super Bowl.\" Neil Reynolds and Jeff Reinebold make their fantasy team from Super Bowl LI players. \n\"Losing a Super Bowl was one of the toughest days of my life\", said Sanders, who lost with the Steelers in his rookie year. \n\"To see the confetti falling, but it wasn't falling on me. To be within arm's reach of the Vince Lombardi trophy, and not being able to take it, was really hard. We went back into the locker room, and that feeling has motivated me to be great.\" \nWhich team will become the next Super Bowl winners?
