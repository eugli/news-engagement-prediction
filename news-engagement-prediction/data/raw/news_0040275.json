Staff Photographer Texas Rangers left fielder Josh Hamilton (32) gets high-fives from team mates in the dugout after hitting a home run during the second inning of their game against the Tampa Bay Rays on Friday, August 14, 2015 Globe Life Stadium in Arlington, Texas. (Ashley Landis/The Dallas Morning News) By SportsDayDFW.com Contact SportsDayDFW.com on Twitter: @SportsDayDFW \nRangers manager Jeff Banister joined the Ben & Skin show on 105.3 The Fan [KRLD-FM] on Tuesday to talk all things Texas baseball. The club is now in Arizona for spring training. Here are some of the highlights: What's a good place for fans to setexpectations on Josh Hamilton? \nJeff Banister: \"I'll open it up and say that this is an athlete that, there's no doubt in my mind, that when his playing days are done, he's still gonna look great, he's probably gonna be able to walk out in the baseball field and hit a pitch 400 feet. The expectations for us right now is for Josh to come in, test himself out, make sure that the knee is healthy, the body is healthy. This is as talented a human being that you'll ever come across. He's exciting, he can do a lot of great things. It is the ability to be able to do those things on a daily basis. Look, this is 162 games. We play every day, with the exception of a few off days here and there. And so when you structure a lineup, you have to be able to have players that are there, are available and can do things to help you win baseball games. \n\"The expectation is, for me: enjoy that he's back in camp, let's see what he can do, what the body can withstand, how good a shape he's gonna get himself into, and can he respond on a daily basis? 'Cause look, the level of play, if this guy is healthy, he can still play. He's still gonna hit monster home runs, he's still gonna be able to hit. It's just, can his legs allow him to run and play? I don't expect an everyday player. It's tough -- it's a rare player that can play every day, at this age -- but, look, this is a guy who's still talented.\" On the importance of player versatility What Mike Napoli's return to Rangers means for Josh Hamilton's hopes of playing first base \nBanister: \"Well, the perfect world is having everyday players. That's the perfect world, and then having players who can step in, fill in and still be quality players when you need to give guys days off. However, nothing's ever perfect, so having flexibility, I believe, is only going to get more crucial in our industry. The 162-game player is, like I just said before, is extremely rare. I don't know that it's that smart. You see it in basketball, you see it in football, rotating offensive backs. The only guy they don't rotate out is the quarterback. In baseball, you play every day, so allowing guys- we've learned that you allow guys to get off their legs, get off their feet and we have flexibility with our players that we can plug players in and play, but also, the other thing is is that, our sport is the only sport that doesn't allow you to re-enter a player once you take him out. \n\"So, that flexibility becomes even more crucial for guys to be able to maneuver around on the field so that, in other spots, if you need to pinch-hit, you need to pinch-run, or you need a defensive replacement, you can do that. But those guys have got to- it's crucial for those guys to be able to do all the things that we ask them to do. If they can't, then you're one-dimensional. What he feels best about regardinghis club entering spring training \nBanister: \"What I feel best about our club is just our identity of who we are, and how we play. We've shown that over the course of the last two years, the culture and chemistry of our club. I think it is the bread and butter, along with the talent on this club. Extremely talented. You don't win 95 games without being talented. When you look at our starting rotation, with Cole Hamels, Yu Darvish, Martin Perez heading up the top three, and then you look at the prospects of a Tyson Ross and Andrew Cashner to round it out when Ross is ready to go -- both these guys at one point in their careers were, they were top, inside that pitching ... when you start stacking these guys up, they were at the top of the list -- so the thing that excites me about them is the prospects of what our coaching staff can get these guys to do. \n\"The bullpen: still strong. We've got some electric arms out in that bullpen that can shut innings down. They gained experience. Now, how they come back after the usage of last year, kind of the workload, time will tell. But the other part of that is just, look, we've got a core group that loves to fight. They understand that this mission is incomplete and oh, by the way, we've got a special player that is about 58 hits away from 3,000, so that'll be fun to watch.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T04:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:08:19.472+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
