It was modelled on the style of the gothic Strawberry Hill in London , but on a smaller scale as a sporting estate. \nWith seven bedrooms, five bathrooms, a guesthouse and five lodges, it offers space and a great deal of style, as well as quite a bit of history. Luggala was built in 1780s for Peter La Touche, a member of a well-known banking family of French-Huguenot background. \nLuggala, Ireland, surrounded by snow.

Photo: Antonio Martinelli/Sotheby’s \nMr Browne’s late brother is Tara Browne, whose death in a car accident is claimed to be the subject of the 1967 Beatles song, Day in the Life . \nGarech Browne had undertaken some major restorations on the property , which is now owned by the family trust, in 1996, spending around €6 million and installing a new library and indoor swimming pool. \nHe and his wife sold about £2 million ($3.24 million) of “clutter” from the castle in 2006 to help pay for the renovations. He said at the time that “there was just too much stuff here, some of it too large and I was living with the contents of two houses”. \nLuggala contains seven bedrooms and five bathrooms. Photo: Antonio Martinelli/Sotheby’s \nThe 7438-square-metre property itself is somewhat famous, at least as a backdrop. It’s been used as a location in the movies Braveheart , 2004’s King Arthur , the notoriously terrible Sean Connery movie Zardoz , and the television series The Tudors and Vikings . \nIt also hosted Michael Jackson not long before his death – in 2006 for three months, at a reported €30,000 per week . The project manager at Luggala, Tony Boylan, remembered him as an “absolute gentleman” and recalled that he asked him to remove a painting – of “the freaky looking guy staring down at him”– from the bedroom he was staying in. \nMick Jagger, Orlando Bloom, Bono and the Beatles have also been guests. \nLuggala offers space and a great deal of style, as well as quite a bit of history. Photo: Antonio Martinelli/Sotheby’s \nThere’s been some suggestion that the Irish government should buy Luggala as part of efforts to preserve it, but the Minister of State Michael Ring has stated that they can’t afford the price tag . \nSo, if you can, you’re still in with a chance. Crawford’s and Sotheby’s have the listing .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T15:46:38.412+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
