The government denies such allegations. \nMalaysia is an outspoken critic of Myanmar's treatment of the Rohingya. Last month, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak slammed Myanmar for letting the abuses continue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T16:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T11:08:54.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
