I can't thank them enough. I am alive because of them,\" Mr Ackerman said about his colleagues. \nMr Wesley is working hard in his rehabilitation to get back to the job. \n\"It is my passion. It is what I have done all my life. I help people, that is what I do.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:08:14.101+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
