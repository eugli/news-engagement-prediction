By Erin Strout Monday, February 6, 2017, 1:16 pm \nDuring the days leading up to the USA Track & Field Cross Country Championships on Saturday, in Bend, Oregon, volunteers took shifts on the course to shovel off two feet of snow. The result was a runnable trail—what some called a “true cross-country experience”—with plenty of muddy stretches for athletes to negotiate. Six of the top finishers in the junior and senior divisions will comprise the U.S. team competing at the world cross-country championships on March 26 in Kampala, Uganda. 1/7 Michael Scott \nAliphine Tuliamuk wins the women’s race. \nThe 27-year-old who trains in Sante Fe, New Mexico, and competed for Witchita State University became a U.S. citizen last April. Tuliamuk collected her fourth U.S. title on Saturday, winning the women’s 10K in 34:25. 2/7 Michael Scott \nLeornard Korir is the men’s winner. \nKorir, 30, takes the men’s 2017 title in 30:12. He's a member of the American Distance Project, and the team swept the top four spots in the men’s race. Korir also competed in the 10,000 meters at the Rio Olympics. 3/7 Michael Scott \nMelody Fairchild takes the masters crown. \nFairchild, 43, of Boulder, Colorado, wins the women’s masters division 6K. It was a triumphant return to her roots in cross country, as Fairchild won the Foot Locker Cross Country Championships in 1989 and 1990. 4/7 Victah Sailer \nA former champion returns. \nChris Derrick, 26, from Portland, Oregon, places fifth and secures a spot on the world championships team. He won the U.S. cross country championships three years in a row from 2013 to 2015. 5/7 Victah Sailer \nNo one avoids the slop. \nKorir, the eventual winner, and his U.S. Army teammate, Shadrack Kipchirchir, negotiate a field of deep mud. Kipchirchir placed third in 30:19. 6/7 Victah Sailer \nSnow lines the course. \nThe men stick to the path cleared by snow-shoveling volunteers during the days leading up to the race. Wintry weather subsided on race day. 7/7 Victor Sailer \nWomen fight for places in the top five. \nOn her way to a fifth-place finish, Sarah Pagano, 25, of Boston, leads Courtney Frerichs, 24, of Portland, Oregon. Frerichs finished in fourth place by four seconds. Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T01:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:47:02.781+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
