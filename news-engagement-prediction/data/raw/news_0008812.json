Then came the final choice, USC: Levi Jones commits to Florida! Wait….Florida State! Wait… \nUSC! \n— ESPNU (@ESPNU) February 1, 2017 \nFor anyone who doesn’t root for the Gators or Seminoles, the reaction from the crowd and announcers is fantastic — they’re stunned when he tears off the Florida shirt, then don’t know how to react when the USC logo finally shows up, with everyone wondering if he had yet another shirt underneath. \nA four-star prank, for sure.
