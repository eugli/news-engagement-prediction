John Doane. \nA pickup truck nearly rolled down an embankment just after 9 a.m. \nLuckily, the back end of the truck got tangled up on the concrete barrier which stopped the vehicle from a roughly 50 metre plunge down the steep hillside. \n\nBlaine Gaffney / Global News \nBlaine Gaffney / Global News \nThe highway was closed for about 15 minutes while the pickup was removed from its perch by a tow truck. \nThe driver wasn’t injured. He says he lost control of his vehicle because of the snow covered road. \nRCMP are asking drivers to slow down when road conditions are snowy. \n“The posted speed limit is for ideal driving conditions only,” said Doane. \n\n. @KelownaRCMP say slow down and drive safe. Roads may be slippery due to the weather conditions #Kelowna #WestKelowna #LakeCountry pic.twitter.com/H3GdGUhJAl \n— Kelowna RCMP (@KelownaRCMP) February 3, 2017 © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
