Instagram \nWell, it turns out this this gorgeous 19-year-old isn’t just turning heads by writing brutally honest captions on social media. \nApparently, Egger is also re-writing history… Tinder history, that is. \nThe Instagram model claims she has set a “world record” for Tinder matches in just a few short months. Tinder \nEgger says she has racked up a whopping 5,400 right swipes since downloading the dating app, while most of us can’t even get the pitiful number of people we match with to message us back. Instagram \nThe London-based model says she has so many right swipes, likes and even super likes, she simply can’t keep up with all of the modern-day Romeos. \nLet’s be real: Having too many guys who want to take you out on romantic dates sounds like a terrible, terrible problem to have.

I travel a lot and people keep super liking me [every Tinder user has one Super Like to give away per day]. \nEgger just assumed being showered in “super likes” was the norm , until friends told her that unlike gorgeous supermodels, most women only get about one of two of these coveted likes each month. Tinder \nAccording to Egger, \nI reached a point where I couldn’t answer everyone anymore, because I had swiped right on every super like. \nIn fact, Egger became so overwhelmed by her Tinder suitors, she eventually added a message to her profile that read, \nSorry this is getting out of hand. I can’t answer everyone anymore. I only reply if your message is super interesting. Hope you understand. \nYou would think some people might be discouraged to swipe right on Egger due to the fact that this young model gets an insane amount of matches each day. Instagram \nHowever, Egger said her disclaimer “improved her Tinder game even more.” \nApparently, a lot of people viewed Egger’s words as a challenge rather than a threat. \nAccording to Egger, \nI would receive the craziest pick-up lines and unbelievable offers. I even matched with Conor Maynard and other well-known musicians, YouTubers and actors. \nAnother crazy offer was when a guy invited me for a week in Greece on his yacht. He offered to pay for everything, even my flight — just so he could have a chance. Of course, I declined that offer. \nDespite matching with 5,400 men, Egger has only been on 20 Tinder dates and is still searching for her right swipe in shining armor.
