After a rough start in which the Melbourne crowd was confused for Sydney , founding members Axl Rose, Slash and Duff McKagan reunited to perform for local fans for the first time since 1993. Rob Mopar \n\"I've loved Guns N' Roses since grade 5 so I had to come. My olds were pretty strict and wouldn't let me come when I was 14. I'm 38 now and they're old men.\" Sarah Kelly Photo: Sarah Kelly. (ABC News: Jane Cowan) \n\"I'm here to witness what I used to pray for in Catholic all girls school: for Slash and Axl to get back together. I used to pray for that in communion. It's just something about them. Their aura, their stage presence. They give it their all.\" Adrian Stubna Photo: Adrian Stubna. \n\"Love the Gunners. Why wouldn't you come? 75,000 people, it's gonna be an epic show. This will be something I think you'll be telling people about 20 years from now. Bad boy rock 'n' roll. It's the money, the fame, the do-anything-you-want attitude. It's rock 'n' roll, that's what it is.\" Russell Peillon \n\"What can I say? I've been a fan from day one. I was around when they brought out their first album and I've been with them since. I'm past the going mental stage, I don't jump up and down.\" Jesse Peillon \n\"I was born and bred into it, straight out of the womb - just rocking. My old man and I just love it. Nothing will beat the classic 80s, 90s stuff. It's just too good.\" Kittiya Pullen \n\"We waited 20 years for today. I wanted to see them years ago in Thailand but they cancelled the concert. I live in Tasmania and Fah came from Thailand for this.\" Andrew and Lisa Georgiou", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T06:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:06:00.817+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
