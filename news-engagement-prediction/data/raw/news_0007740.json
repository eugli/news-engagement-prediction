SEE ALSO: Donald Trump finally got a fact right \nHe couldn't resist taking another jab at his Apprentice replacement host, Arnold Schwarzenegger, by cracking a bizarre joke in the form of a prayer about ratings. \nAfter noting his own \"tremendous success\" as the reality show's host, he called out the show's drop in ratings since Schwarzenegger took over. \n\"They hired a big, big movie star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, to take my place, and we know how that turned out,\" Trump said at the Prayer Breakfast, for reasons no one could quite understand. \"The ratings went right down the tubes. It’s been a total disaster,\" he went on, \"and Mark will never ever bet against Trump again.\" \nThen came the ridiculously inappropriate and untimely punchline: \"I want to just pray for Arnold, if we can, for those ratings.\" He then laughed at his joke.

Schwarzenegger was so peeved at the president that he responded via video. \"Hey Donald. I have a great idea, why don't we switch jobs?\" he proposed with a smile. \"You take over TV, because you're such an expert in ratings and then I take over your job. Then people can finally sleep comfortably again, hmm?\" The National Prayer Breakfast? pic.twitter.com/KYUqEZbJIE \n— Arnold (@Schwarzenegger) February 2, 2017 \nAfter Schwarzenegger's season aired earlier this year, Trump was quick to trash his ratings. Wow, the ratings are in and Arnold Schwarzenegger got \"swamped\" (or destroyed) by comparison to the ratings machine, DJT. So much for.... \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2017 being a movie star-and that was season 1 compared to season 14. Now compare him to my season 1. But who cares, he supported Kasich & Hillary \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2017 \nEven back then Arnie took the high road. He provided him with a mature, slightly sassy comeback and a wise Abraham Lincoln quote for him to study in preparation for taking office. I wish you the best of luck and I hope you'll work for ALL of the American people as aggressively as you worked for your ratings.
