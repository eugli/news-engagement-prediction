(AP) - A woman has admitted to killing her weightlifter husband by lacing his steroid injections with antifreeze.\nForty-seven-year-old Jamie Baker faces 15 years to life in prison for poisoning her 42-year-old husband James Baker, a competitive weightlifter who died in September 2013. Authorities said an autopsy found ethylene glycol in his system. The chemical is found in antifreeze.\nJamie Baker reportedly told officers she filled a hypodermic syringe with antifreeze and injected it into her husband's bottles of liquid steroids, but she did not give them a motive.\nShe had been charged with first-degree murder but pleaded guilty to second-degree murder Monday in Kent County Superior Court in Delaware. Her sentencing is set for March 30.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:08:46.287+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
