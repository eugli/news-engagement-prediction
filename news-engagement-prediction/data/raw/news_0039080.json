I can live with either one.” \nTrump added that he “thought for a while the two-state looked like it may be the easier of the two,” but reiterated that “if Israel and the Palestinians are happy, I’m happy with the one they like the best.” \n— Tamerra Griffin ID: 10537420 Clinton campaign manager likens Trump administration’s secret communications with Russia to Watergate \nClinton campaign mgr @RobbyMook: \"The parallels to watergate here are eerie..and it's getting closer and closer toâ¦ https://t.co/mBeE4Diwyw — Tom Namako (@TomNamako) ID: 10537183 Robby Mook, former Clinton campaign manager, called the parallels between the Trump administration’s talks with Russia and the Watergate scandal “eerie,” especially as the revelations lead closer and closer to Trump. \n“I can tell you it is extremely strange to me that a member of any American presidential campaign would be speaking to Russian intelligence officials,” he said. \n“And it’s particularly bizarre, given the fact that we know that Russian intelligence officials broke into the DNC, stole documents, and handed them to WikiLeaks for the purpose of hurting Hillary Clinton and helping Donald Trump,” he added. ID: 10537198 Senator John McCain: Flynn resignation “raises serious questions” Sen. John McCain said Tuesday that Flynn’s resignation raised serious questions, and heightened concerns over national security in the interim period. \n“With now no national security adviser, and with turmoil within the administration, makes it very difficult for us to exercise responsibilities to defend the nation,” he said on CNN. \n“On the Flynn issue, I think we need to ask questions first and find out what the scope of that milieu or investigation needs to be expanded,” he added.

ID: 10535580 He started by calling out the “fake news media.” \nThe fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. @MSNBC & @CNN are unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) ID: 10535588 Then moved on to “Hillary Clinton’s losing campaign.” \nThis Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton's losing campaign. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) ID: 10535601 After that, Trump tweeted that the intelligence community was illegally filtering information to “failing” news outlets — “Just like Russia.” \nInformation is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?).Just like Russia — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Then he reminded everyone that Russia took Crimea during the Obama administration. \nCrimea was TAKEN by Russia during the Obama Administration. Was Obama too soft on Russia? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) ID: 10535607 Distancing himself from the “scandal,” he said the real issue is the “un-American” handing out of classified information. \nThe real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by \"intelligence\" like candy.
