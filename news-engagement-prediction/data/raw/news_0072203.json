Barcroft Media via Getty Images Nadiya Hussain \nShe said of her new venture: “ Our country’s regional cuisine is much more than tried and tested traditional dishes - there are quirky and clever food producers out there who are reinventing British food in unique and exciting ways. \n“I can’t wait to meet these local food heroes, to find inspiration in the most unusual food stories and unlikely ingredients and then come up with some brand new recipes in the kitchen, adding my own special twist.” \nNadiya has carved a successful media career for herself since being crowned ‘Bake Off’ champion in 2015, and it was even suggested last year that she could be teaming up with former judge Mary Berry on a new BBC show , after the latter decided not to go with ‘Bake Off’ when it made the jump to Channel 4. \nNadiya recently suggested that she wasn’t sure how the reboot of ‘Bake Off’ would fare on its new channel , admitting: “ The one problem with humans is that we don’t like change and the second you change something that we love people freak out a little bit… we just don’t want a repetition of ‘Top Gear’ do we?” \n‘Nadiya’s British Food Adventure’ will debut later in 2017.

'Great British Bake Off': Where Are They Now? 1 11 Edd Kimber (winner, 2010) Fresh from being crowned the winner of the first ever ‘Bake Off’, Ed quit his day job as a debt collector for Yorkshire Bank (which he hated) to follow his baking dream with a job in Raymond Blanc’s restaurant Le Manoir as a pastry chef (what else?). He’s gone on to carve himself a career as a food writer with articles appearing in BBC Good Food magazine and on his blog theboywhobakes.co.uk. In 2011 he published his first cookbook, ran a pop-up bakery in Fortnum & Mason and is also the resident baker on ‘The Alan Titchmarsh Show’. “Bake Off changed [my life] in the most amazing way. It allowed me to follow my passion and fulfil my dreams in a way I never imagined,” he said recently.
