Police had initially referred to a \"potential threat.\"\nThey later confirmed that a bomb threat had been phoned in to the Canada Games Centre, whose staff then notified police.\nParents were asked to pick up their children at the playroom, while others had to vacate the pool or clear off the ice.\nâ€‹Durand Cornett was in the middle of a hockey game when a rink attendant came and interrupted.\n\"We got pulled off the ice. We had four minutes left in our hockey game,\" he said. \"It wasn't much of a rush to get out or anything, but people eventually were escorted out.\"\nRCMP then inspected the building, with help of a bomb disposal unit. At about 4 p.m., they declared the building to be clear of any threat.\nThe facility was reopened about an hour later.\nPolice are still investigating the origin of the threat.\nPolice had blocked off the entrance to the facility early Friday afternoon.
