Bush did something extraordinary. He went to the Islamic Center of Washington, D.C., one week after the Sept. 11 terror attacks , and praised Islam as a religion of peace . \n\"When we think of Islam we think of a faith that brings comfort to a billion people around the world. Billions of people find comfort and solace and peace. And that's made brothers and sisters out of every race‚Äîout of every race,\" he said to those assembled. \nIt was a speech designed to halt the violent attacks against innocent American Muslims that had been taking place following 9/11, and to help people understand that the 19 terrorists were to Islam what the Ku Klux Klan was to Christianity: A group of violent extremist who blasphemed the religion they purported to uphold.
