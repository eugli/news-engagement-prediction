Perhaps just for a short spell, even? \nWhedon on Tuesday offered this confessional tweet, saying, “I think I’m broken”: I think I'm broken \nI never ran smooth but I think I'm really broken, I'm sorry, I was funny for a while, good times, please keep fighting \n— Joss Whedon (@joss) February 7, 2017 \nHe added that, “I never ran smooth but I think I’m really broken, I’m sorry, I was funny for a while, good times, please keep fighting.” \nNow, Whedon doesn’t specifically say what apparently has got him down, but a number of concerned Twitter users picked up the vibe that he’s throwing in the progressive political towel over Trump dismantling Obama strongholds at a breakneck pace: Your religion is politics, @joss . That's why you're constantly distraught and angry. You're putting your trust in mere mortals. \n— Alo Konsen (@OhioCoastie) February 7, 2017 @joss Don't stop. Your voice is needed.
