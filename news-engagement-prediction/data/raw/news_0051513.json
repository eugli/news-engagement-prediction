He yelled toward the field: “Dai, dai! Atta boy! Bravo! Get that ball!” He drank an Aperol spritz and a few glasses of rosé. “I’m going to get a bad headache,” he said. “But if we pull this game out, it’ll be worth it. It’s two Advil.” The conversation at halftime turned to the region’s famous gastronomic tradition, or as Piazza called it, “the other reason I bought the team.” He breathlessly cataloged the area’s cured meats: “The prosciutto, the bresaola, the coppa, the mortadella — that’s all here.” Noting that he had met with groups aiming for expansion franchises in Major League Soccer before buying Reggiana, he said: “I’d rather be poor in Italy than based in St. Louis. You can’t get a good meal there!” When Reggiana scored its eventual winning goal in the second half, Piazza threw a left-handed uppercut — balancing the wineglass in his other hand — and let out a prolonged yell. He cursed when a Reggiana player injured himself and again when the fourth official announced that there would be four minutes of injury time. “Yeah!” Piazza said when the final whistle blared, before closing his eyes and touching his chest. “Mamma mia.” Afterward, several fans walked over to greet Piazza, addressing him as “Presidente” — the formality of which always makes his wife, Alicia Rickter, laugh. Piazza shook hands and posed for pictures. “Grazie per essere venuti,” he said. Thank you for coming.

Piazza has adopted the same approach to life in Italy. He was 34 when he visited Italy for the first time. He had been to Japan seven times at that point in his life, but somehow never to the home country of his paternal grandparents. The trip changed him, he said. Growing up, he had absorbed a bundle of cultural idiosyncrasies — whether tastes, mannerisms or locutions — that sometimes manifested themselves explicitly or in other cases merely fizzed beneath his consciousness. In Rome, he found these stray fragments of his identity fitting naturally, exhilaratingly, into his surroundings. The next year, he and his father visited Sciacca, the town on the southwestern coast of Sicily where his great-great-great-great-great-grandfather Giuseppe Piazza was born in 1789. “I felt like a duck going back to water,” Piazza said. “I just related. I could just feel it. I just felt Italian.” Continue reading the main story Photo Piazza San Prospero in Reggio Emilia. Piazza said he had met with groups involving Major League Soccer franchises, but the Italian culture was part of the lure of Reggiana. “I’d rather be poor in Italy than based in St. Louis,” he said. “You can’t get a good meal there!” Credit Clara Vannucci for The New York Times These days, Piazza has been renting a home in a village called Quattro Castella, about 10 miles south of Reggio Emilia. He has considered having his children — Nicoletta, 10; Paulina, 7; and Marco, 3 — attend Italian schools for a year. In the restaurant, Piazza fiddled with the patterned scarf around his neck, joking that he accessorized like this only in Italy, where he felt sartorially inadequate alongside the locals. Scanning a menu, he made a face when he came across the horse tartare; his children were taking riding lessons, he explained. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Piazza is enjoying this cross-cultural learning process. He said the rigors of this new life — stacking airline miles, struggling with a new language, savoring new foods, connecting to his family’s roots — had invigorated him in the vacuum left by baseball. “I played baseball for 16 years,” Piazza said. “I’ve had to reconcile the fact that I’ll never again feel the juice of hitting a home run in front of 50,000 people.” To be sure, baseball still seeped into conversation during the first two days of his trip. Orlando Hernández and Byung-Hyun Kim were the two pitchers he never figured out. He thought the increasing reliance on “Moneyball” principles had precipitated his retirement. He called being booed at Yankee Stadium “the coolest thing I remember from my career.” But it is soccer, calcio, that consumes him now. “I like the adventure of this,” he said of the Reggiana project. “I’ll hop on a train. I’ll hop on a plane. I’ll get in the car. I’ll just go. I like the energy.” He sipped Lambrusco, a sparkling red wine produced in the region. “I could fail,” he said. “I could end up losing some money here. But it was important to me to step outside of my comfort zone.” \nBrando de Leonardis contributed reporting.
