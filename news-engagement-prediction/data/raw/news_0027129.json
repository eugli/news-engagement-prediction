It made sense, given his obvious frustration with having to field daily questions about the film, as well as the apparent all-to-late realization that allying yourself, and tying your career, so closely to WB/DC for the coming decade is something of a poison pill. \nThe DC Extended Universe needs a win. Hell, they just need something on the scoreboard. Wonder Woman will be relevant and wacky, but the jury's still out on whether it'll actually be good. Justice League already seems a bit of a mess, and DC are apparently doing nothing to fix their \"all our baddies are nondescript giant grey CGI monsters\" problem . The Batman is by far the best bet to haul this prematurely ailing franchise into some semblance of quality. \nEnter Matt Reeves \nReeves's resume so far is light, some would say unspectacular: his directorial breakout was the 2008 weirdo-hit Cloverfield , often mistakenly attributed to producer J.J. Abrams. From there, Reeves made Let Me In , a needless but evenhanded, stylish remake of the beautiful, melancholy Swedish horror film Let the Right One In released just a few years prior. \nAt the moment, Reeves is shepherding the revived, bizarre, wonderful Planet of the Apes film series. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes , the second movie in the franchise but Reeves's first, was a triumph of genre filmmaking that enriched the impressive world-building of the first film, and continued to frame the whole thing from a realistic, emotional perspectiveâ€”no small feat when you're trying to make an audience take a bunch of talking, super-smart apes seriously. The third (and presumably Reeves' last), War for the Planet of the Apes , already looks to continue his hot streak. \nDemonstrably, Matt Reeves is the perfect director for material that shouldn't quite work. It's not unrealistic at all to imagine Cloverfield or Dawn of the Planet of the Apes , both experimental, nowhere near sure bets, would have been far worse movies in other hands. His signature on the Batman movie is just what WB needs. Along with Patty Jenkins ( Wonder Woman ) and James Wan ( Aquaman ), the studio is building an impressive roster of filmmaker talent its direct competitor, Marvel Studios, has comparably struggled with due to their stringent, increasingly homogenized guidelines. \nThe Batman still doesn't have a release date, but it will star Ben Affleck, be directed by Matt Reeves, and will try its dang hardest to be a good movie.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T00:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T21:23:48.979+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
