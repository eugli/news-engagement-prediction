Everyday life is stressful and the children are at home. This could be an opportunity to have their own time.” \nGood luck coming up with an appropriate answering machine message for that one. “Hello clients. Sorry I can’t take your call right now, I’m a bit busy taking something far more pleasurable. Good day to you.” ‘STOP INTERRUPTING MY PAID FORNICATION TIME!’ Source: Supplied \nBut hey, apparently office orgasms are the way forward. \nA recent survey by Time Out New York found 39 per cent of male readers reported masturbating in the office, after an earlier poll by Glamour in 2012 put that figure at 31 per cent of workers. \nPsychologist and life coach Doctor Cliff Arnall accordingly told Metro that masturbation breaks should be taken “if they’re motivated by a genuine desire for stress relief”. \nSweden already enjoys several work benefits not typically afforded elsewhere, including 480 days of paid parental leave and very little overtime work. \nAccording to the OECD Better Life Index, only one per cent of Swedes work overtime. \nSwedish fulltime employees work the third-least amount in Europe, after Finland and France. \nMeanwhile, in January, nurses in the city of Gothenburg began a two-year experiment to cut work hours while maintaining their pay levels. \nThe initial results were largely positive, with nurses reporting better health, less sick leave and patient care improving.
