(Who could forget MJ’s iconic free throw line dunk ?) To honor his Airness’s greatness during his epic ASW run, Jordan Brand is releasing a brand spanking-new Air Jordan 1 style timed to this weekend’s All-Star Weekend in New Orleans. \nDubbed the “Air Jordan 1 High All-Star”, the high top is inspired by MJ’s 1982 NCAA National Championship victory (which just happened to take place in New Orleans as well.) It’s alluded to in the kicks’ vamp, ankle, and heel, where iridescent blue details call to mind both Jordan’s North Carolina uniform and the plastic-y sheen of Mardi Gras beads. That’s counter-balanced by a high-contrast black-and-white upper and white sidewall. The overall effect is very business up front, party in the back (it helps the silhouette in play here is the Jordan 1, a.k.a. the most wearable and minimal of any Jordan silhouette). \nPlenty of other brands are rolling out a slew of souped-up kicks this week to capitalize on the annual gathering of the NBA’s biggest talents. These Air Jordan 1 High All-Stars are hardly attention-seeking compared to the competition. Onlookers might not even realize there’s anything new or special about the classic kicks before you’re walking away—and that’s what makes them worth hunting down. It’s the kind of special release that’s actually wearable, able to sit under jeans or chinos or sweats without overpowering the rest of your outfit. In that way, this pair is a fitting tribute to the legend. After all, MJ always knew that All-Star Weekend was a time for bringing your A-game, even among the best of the best. \nGet yours at nike.com ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T14:35:00.431+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
