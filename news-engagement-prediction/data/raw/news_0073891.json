Salvatore Di Nolfi/Keystone via AP \nMANILA, Philippines — The Philippines' top diplomat lamented that international observers are more focused on the human rights of drug suspects being targeted by President Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs. \nIn his speech before the 34th session of the Human Rights Council at the United Nations Office in Geneva, Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay Jr. noted that law enforcement authorities are being portrayed as the \"villain\" and the \"enemy\" in the drug war. \n\"They instead depict a violent picture of law enforcement operations against these ruthless malefactors, who will not hesitate to violate the human rights of their victims or to kill any man, woman and child that comes in the way of their lucrative trade,\" Yasay said. \nThe Foreign Affairs secretary claimed that the media has failed to show interest in the risks that law enforcement authorities face in curbing the illegal drug trade. \nMedia coverage of the drug war has focused on those killed -- at least 7,000 since July 2016 -- in the drug war, including those whose families claim were either innocent or were users but not dealers. Of that number, around 2,500 have been killed in actual police operations. The government has attributed the rest to vigilantes and to a supposed cleansing within the drug syndicates. \nAs of late January, 35 police officers and three Armed Forces personnel have been killed in anti-drug operations. Security forces have also recorded 87 police personnel wounded in operations while eight from the Armed Forces of the Philippines have been recorded wounded. Headlines ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1 'Drug war critics protect narcotics trade' \nYasay said that international observers have done nothing to help in eliminating the drug problem in the country. \n\"The actions of these critics and watchdogs have only served to encourage, support, and even protect – wittingly or unwittingly – the illicit drug trade,\" the secretary said. \nThe secretary stressed that the Philippine government recognizes the importance of carrying out the anti-narcotics war in a manner that underscores its obligation to defend and protect the rights of the Filipino people. \n\"As a matter of practice, all law enforcers are held to abide by established procedures. Human rights enforcers ensure that operational protocols are aligned with the law and existing international practices, which are to be strictly followed,\" Yasay said. \nAn Amnesty International report released in February alleged some police officers were involved in the killings themselves or through hired killers. \nIt said in the same report, which looked into 33 cases of drug-related killings, that it found \"a pattern of police inaction and impunity, often insurmountable obstacles for complainants pursuing legal action and difficulties facing human rights defenders working on these issues.\" \nAmnesty said that \"in killings carried out during formal operations, police reports are startlingly similar from case to case.\" \nPolice participation in the war on drugs has been suspended over the death of a Korean businessman who was abducted from his home in Angeles City in Pampanga in October by rogue members of a police anti-narcotics unit. It has since been found that he was killed inside the PNP headquarters in Camp Crame. 'Philippines committed to upholding human rights' \nYasay assured the UN council that the Philippines remains resolute in promoting, protecting and upholding human rights of its citizens. \n\"Our obligation to defend and protect the rights of our people is mandated by our solemn duty to uphold due process and the rule of law as required under our justice system,\" the secretary said. \nThe Philippines was among the first members of the first UN Commission that drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1947. The country was also one of the founding members of the Human Rights Council, which was formed in 2006. \nThe Department of Foreign Affairs said that Yasay's presence at the HRC in Geneva signifies the Philippines' commitment to meet its international obligations, particularly with the UN and its mechanisms. \nThe HRC is the principal organization of the UN dealing with the promotion and protection of human rights. \nYasay is the second Foreign Affairs secretary who participated in the High-Level Segment of the HRC after former Foreign Affairs Secretary Alberto Romulo who addressed the Council in March 2008. \nThe council meets for its regular sessions thrice a year. The session for March this year features 107 dignitaries from UN member states.
