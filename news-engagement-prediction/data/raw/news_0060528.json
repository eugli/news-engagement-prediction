(True story: The brand is the reason many Allure editors got their dads to finally wear sunscreen.) And its latest launch, the La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Moisturizer, is no exception. Come January, the skin-care giant, which always seems to be ahead of the skin trends curve (for example, its high-tech UV-monitoring patch ), is debuting a new four-piece collection, including the La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Moisturizer, all packed with prebiotics—you know, the non-digestible food ingredients that promote the growth of good-for-your-gut bacteria in the intestines. Why would you want bacteria on your face? Well, a few years ago scientists discovered that on top of the skin's physical barrier there's another layer of diverse micro-organisms called the \"microbiome.\" Or, as New York City-based dermatologist, explains it: \"The collection of natural bacteria that live on the skin and help promote healthy skin cell function.\" For decades, nearly every skin-care product on the market has been aimed at treating the skin's physical barrier. But after learning of the microbiome, La Roche-Posay turned their attention to this invisible layer of good bacteria on the skin. And after five years and 13 clinical studies, the brand discovered a connection between the skin's physical barrier and the microbiome—namely that good bacterial diversity in the microbiome is the key to good skin (healthy, hydrated), while bad bacterial diversity equals bad skin.

So what makes the Toleriane line any different than the rest of La Roche-Posay's products? All four products contain a higher concentration of Thermal Spring Water than usual, making them even better at treating and maintaining the bacterial diversity of the microbiome.
