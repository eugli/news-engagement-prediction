( IND vs AUS, 1st Test - LIVE Blog | Scorecard ) \nThe 32-year-old`s stunning exploits saw India concede a 155-run first innings lead -- with captain Virat Kohli was dismissed for a rare duck -- and put Australia in charge of the first match of the four-Test series. \nKohli, who has hit four double centuries since July last year, walked after just two deliveries for his first duck in a Test since against England in August 2014. \nIndian opener Lokesh Rahul top-scored for the home side with a gritty 64 as eight Indian batsmen failed to get into double figures. \nIndia went to lunch 70-3 and got to 94 without further loss before O`Keefe, who had been largely ineffective during the morning session, swung control of the match to Australia. \nHe claimed three wickets in his 10th over to leave the Indian middle-order rattled at India`s newest Test venue, which has seen a considerable turn from the beginning. \nThe wickets of Rahul, Ajinkya Rahane (13) and Wriddhiman Saha (0) broke India`s batting back and there was no looking back for O`Keefe in just his fifth ever Test. \nIndia lost their last seven batsmen for a paltry 11 runs to post a first-innings total of just 105. Earlier, Mitchell Starc had claimed the prized scalp of Kohli. \nStarc, who hit a gritty 61 in Australia`s first innings of 260, took two wickets in the space of three deliveries as the tourists made decisive early inroads into the Indian batting line-up. \nIndia's total of 105 in first innings would be considered embarrassing but it was far from the list of top 10 lowest totals in the format. \nHere's the list:- \n10. South Africa 43 v England (1889) \n9. India 42 v England (1974) \n8. Australia 42 v England (1888) \n7. New Zealand 42 v Australia (1946) \n6. Australia 36 v England (1902) \n5. South Africa 36 v Australia (1932) \n4. South Africa 35 v England (1899) \n3. South Africa 30 v England (1924) \n2. South Africa 30 v England (1896) \n1. New Zealand – 26 v England (1955) \nSteve Smith's men were dismissed for 260 in their first innings at Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium. \n(With Agency inputs) First Published: Friday, February 24, 2017 - 14:08 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T07:26:30.653+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
