Welcome to a new week, Verge readers. Today's the oldest you've even been, but also the youngest you'll ever be again. So, with that in mind, let's take a look at your future. Today kicks off the big two-day Code Media conference in California with a focus on the trends and topics that shape media. This year's event features the likes of Apple's Eddy Cue, and execs from Google, Facebook, Buzzfeed, and The Washington Post. No doubt there will be plenty of discussion about operating strategies in a post-fact age where a White House wages war against the media. In tech you can expect a deeper dive on both the Leica M10 and new Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 . We'll also be taking a closer look at the magnificent silver swan automaton built in 1773, and currently on display at the London Science Museum. In entertainment you can expect another installment of our love / hate relationship with The Walking Dead after the show made its mid-season return last night. We'll also be taking a look at Humans season 2 which returns tonight, and then offering some insight as to why Matt Damon's Great Wall of China is important for Hollywood. You can also expect a book review of Neil Gaiman's Norse Mythology . In gaming we're planning a review of the delightful Hidden Folks , set for release on Wednesday. We'll also have lots of say about the release of Halo Wars 2 and For Honor , both set for release this week. Andrew Webster will also be taking a look at Kickstarter's influence on game development in the days ahead. Transportation is planning a little somethin' on the Audi S3, while science is preparing a report about the clinics of the future. We're also working on the science of aphrodisiacs, just in case you need some help luring a mate on Valentine's Day.
