In today’s Movie Morsels, we learn that the studio might already have secured a director for its adaptation of one of the most revered X-Men stories ever, The Dark Phoenix Saga . Plus, we’ve got a new featurette on Kong: Skull Island , casting updates on Godzilla: King of the Monsters and The Predator , and oh so very much more! \nX-Men: Supernova \nX-Men: The Last Stand has long been a thorn in the side of Marvel mutant lovers. While it brings writer Chris Claremont and artist John Byrne’s fabled “Dark Phoenix Saga,” arguably the most acclaimed X-Men comic storyline, to the screen, it does so rather rather halfheartedly. So let’s all put our hands together and pray that X-Men: Days of Future Past screenwriter Simon Kinberg at long last does the story of poor Jean Grey’s transformation into the most fearsome force in the galaxy some well-deserved justice. According to Collider, Kinberg is in talks to both write and direct the film, set in the ’90s and titled X-Men: Supernova– a likely confirmation it will center around Phoenix (played by X-Men: Apocalypse ‘s Jean Grey, Sophie Turner). The website reports that it does focus on the Dark Phoenix storyline. If Kinberg does get the job, it will mark his directorial debut. \n[ Collider ] \nKong: Skull Island \nHowever next month’s Kong: Skull Island fares at the box office, one thing’s for sure: it will definitely have the biggest King Kong yet seen on screen. Not only is he the tallest ape in terms of height, but he’ll also occupy a bigger movie screen than any previous Kong, thanks to IMAX. Now we’ve got a new featurette offering a glimpse at just how massive the format will make the Eighth Wonder of the World… \n[ Warner Bros. ] \nGodzilla: King of the Monsters \nAnd speaking of giant monsters… After Kong, the next creature to roar on screen in Legendary’s new shared MonsterVerse will be everyone’s favorite atomic lizard, who returns in Godzilla: King of the Monsters . The latest big name to join the project, after the recently announced Millie Bobbie Brown, is Kyle Chandler. It’s worth noting that although he’s best known for dramas like Friday Night Lights and Manchester by the Sea , Chandler’s stared down a big-ass creature or two before, in J.J. Abrams’ Super 8 . So he’s got plenty of experience tilting his head back and looking awestricken while things around him get demolished. \n[ Variety ] \nThe Predator \nWant still more monster mayhem? Ooookay… As much as I like the new John Wick: Chapter 2 , it does miss one of the best things from the original Wick– Game of Thrones star Alfie Allen. But we won’t have to wait to long to see Allen up to his bug-eyed eyeballs in trouble again, because he’s just become prey for Shane Black’s The Predator ! \n[ The Hollywood Reporter ] \nMoana \nDisney’s animated, Oscar-nominated South Seas-set musical Moana just landed on Digital HD yesterday. Here are some clips from the film’s bonus features that are sure to raise fans’ Rock-caliber smiles. The first sees stars Auli’i Cravalho and Dwayne Johnson himself revealing some of the film’s Easter eggs, while the second features the internet’s boyfriend Lin-Manuel Miranda on the creation of his song “We Know the Way.” Enjoy! \n[ Disney ] \nKing Arthur: Legend of the Sword \nAnd just in case you missed it yesterday, I visited the London set of King Arthur: Legend of the Sword and learned how director Guy Ritchie and star Charlie Hunnam are hellbent on making a centuries-old tale compelling for today’s movie audiences. \n[ Nerdist ] \nJohn Wick: Chapter 3 \nGiven the praise John Wick: Chapter 2 has received, it’s not at all surprising that star Keanu Reeves already has an idea for John Wick: Chapter 3 . And it’s a pretty darn good one at that! \n[ Nerdist ] \nYoung Han Solo ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:33:16.439+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
