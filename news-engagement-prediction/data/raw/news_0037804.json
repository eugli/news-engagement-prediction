Photo: Bloomberg \nThe open format did give journalists a chance to challenge him on some falsehoods directly. During his lengthy preamble, he once again repeated the lie that his electoral college victory was \"the biggest since Reagan\". \nAn MSNBC reporter took him up on that, telling him his tally was lower than both Barack Obama and George H. W. Bush and asked \"why should Americans trust you...?\" \nTrump replied curtly: \"I don't know, I was given that information.\" \nAs the press conference moved past the one-hour mark, there were several extraordinary exchanges with individual reporters that raised eyebrows in the room. \nBecoming irritated with the repeated questions on Russia and Flynn, he scouted around for a \"friendly reporter\". He settled on journalist from Ami , an Orthodox Jewish magazine, who rose out of his chair and asked the president about rising anti-Semitism in the US and recent bomb threats made against 48 Jewish community centres. \nThe president grew visibly irritated, putting up his hand to cut off the reporter and complaining: \"he said he's going to ask a simple easy question, and it's not, not a simple question, not a fair question, ok sit down,\" before going on to say he was \"the least anti-Semitic person\". \nIn another strange exchange, April Ryan, a black reporter, asked if Mr Trump was going to meet with members of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC). \n\"Do you wanna set up the meeting?\" he replied. \"Are they friends of yours?\" \nHe went on to say a meeting had been set up and then cancelled. The CBC tweeted soon after that they had written to Trump in January and he had never replied. \nThe faces of some news anchors in the wake of the conference captured the disbelief that many might have felt watching this rambling, pugnacious display. It was \"wild\" and \"unhinged\", said CNN's Jake Tapper: \"It was an airing of grievances, it was Festivus\" (the fictional Seinfeld holiday where George Costanza's father rants about his grievances from the preceding year). \nEven over on Fox News, the moderate daytime anchor Shepard Smith declared the display was \"crazy\". \nBut to other sections of the media, and perhaps the country, that ferociously back him, the event was a ringing success. The Drudge Report's headline declared \"Trump eats the press\", while Fox News host and Trump cheerleader Sean Hannity called it \"amazing\" and a \"beat down\" of the media. Here, they saw a return to the good old days of the election campaign, where Trump would repeatedly taunt the media from the stage while a crowd cheered. \nTrump has scheduled a campaign-style rally in Florida this Saturday - an unconventional move for a president just a month into office. He loves the crowds, and knows that they loved the rousing, chaotic, pugnacious campaign that he ran all the way to victory last year. \nThis press conference was a reminder that he's also counting on the same wild, aggressive confrontations with the media that he had during the campaign to carry him through his time in the White House - especially perhaps during weeks like this one when his administration is on the ropes.
