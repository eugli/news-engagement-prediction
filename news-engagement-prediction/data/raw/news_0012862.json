The company is one of the traders participating at the ‘Eat The World DXB’ event at the Burj Park on February 25 to 27.\n“With its undisputed reputation for luxury and incredible ability to build almost anything bigger and better than the rest of the world, we couldn’t return to Eat The World DXB without something extra special this year,” Shearman said.\nFood trucks are becoming a more regular presence in the UAE, with vendors coming together at weekend events, dishing up a variety of streed food to the country's growing population.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T22:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T13:50:11.484+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
