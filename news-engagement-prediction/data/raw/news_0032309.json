The two onetime neighbors had been close friends and began attending a mosque together in 2010. Even as Marquez told friends he hoped to enlist in the U.S. Navy, prosecutors say, he and Farook were secretly amassing weapons, discussing radical Islam and plotting terrorist attacks in California. \nAccording to court records, Marquez and Farook had plotted to launch attacks on the 91 Freeway in Corona and at Riverside City College in 2011 and 2012, but both plots were aborted, records show. \nIn exchange for the guilty pleas, the government agreed to dismiss the other charges against him, although the judge can consider dismissed charges when deciding on a sentence for Marquez. \nFarook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, were killed in a gun battle with police hours after the Dec. 2, 2015, attacks. The shootings at the Inland Regional Center left 14 people dead and 22 others injured.
