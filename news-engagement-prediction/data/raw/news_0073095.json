Coulter said she didn’t want Trump “hanging around with the enemy. He could be in danger at the White House Correspondents Dinner.” \n“He has everyone against him, I want him in the White House working,” Coulter said. “This is a frivolous event.” \nCoulter went on to defend Trump’s feud with the media by saying that he was taking aim at the “lying media” and not attacking the 1st Amendment or the free press. Circling back to her argument that Trump never mocked a disabled reporter during a campaign event, the conservative pundit continued by saying that the media is notorious for making up lies about POTUS on a regular basis. \nWatch above, via Fox.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T10:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T07:48:49.485+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
