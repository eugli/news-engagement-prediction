A superstar like Sting can play pretty much wherever he wants. The last time he came through Los Angeles last year he easily sold out the spacious Hollywood Bowl twice over for a total of 35 thousand people. And that's a not even a particularly big space for him. There probably aren't many spaces Sting can't sell out, so it's a rare experience to catch him somewhere like the Hollywood Palladium, a historic theater with a long and celebrated history and room for just 3,700. That’s exactly why Citi brought him there for two performances during the star-studded kickoff of its exclusive ongoing Citi Sound Vault concert series. Sting.

For five nights last week, Citi Sound Vault gave fans a chance to experience three legendary rock veterans—plus a beat-powered duo on the fast track to superstardom— up close and very personal. They were some of the most coveted shows of music’s biggest week. Getting in only took two things: a little bit of luck and a Citi® card. At the Palladium you could feel the anticipation in the air even before you entered the historic Art Deco theater, which since its opening in 1940 has played host to a who’s who of notable artists. Ticket holders entered through the lobby, which had been dressed up for the occasion with nooks full of candles and gold-toned animated projections lighting up the dome above—a high-tech decorating scheme that turned up the venue’s classic Hollywood elegance and gave it the air of being let into some kind of posh club for music-loving celebrities. Inside the auditorium, fans buzzed as they filed in and discovered that there wasn’t a bad view in the house, no jumbotron required. Throughout the venue lucky fans took selfies to commemorate the once in a lifetime experience (and probably making more than a few their friends at home jealous in the process). Sting.

Sting kicked off the series with an anecdote about his first time visiting L.A. as a kid, where he was so blown away by seeing the city’s famous palm trees in real life that he went up to one and wrapped his arms around it. “That was my introduction to tree hugging,” he joked to the room while sitting in a bar chair holding an acoustic guitar, before offering a solo rendition of his nostalgia-tinged “Heading South on the Great North Wood.” After turning the stage over to opening performances by his son, Joe Sumner, and the rootsy San Antonio outfit Last Bandoleros, the rock legend returned to take the crowd through a sprawling set spanning his entire career, from classic Police hits through every turn of his eclectic solo work before landing on his latest composition “The Empty Chair.” Between the intimate space and Sting’s disarming between-song banter, you could relate to what he must have felt like as a kid seeing a California palm tree for the first time, having something so inimitably iconic within arm’s reach. Beck.

Then, while closing the hit-packed evening, he led the band through an extended version of “Where It’s At” that transformed partway through into a medley of buoyant cover songs, and in the process let his inner music geek shine through the polished rock-star exterior.

The Chainsmokers were the newest act to play Citi Sound Vault (and the latest to win one of music’s top honors), but their performance demonstrated that they can easily keep up with the series’s veteran musicians. Their set began with an explosion of pyrotechnics, lasers, and bone-shaking bass, and didn’t let up for nearly two hours. From behind a table decorated with its own LED screen to give even more space to their eye-popping computer graphics, Alex Pall and Drew Taggart served up one banger after another, veering from EDM to trap rap to pop—and even a quick excursion into pop-punk—for a crowd that was eager to follow them through every twist. It was a master class in sensory overload, but like Sting and Beck before them, the pair also used the close quarters as an opportunity to get a little personal. In between executing rock-star leaps from their DJ platform, Pall told the crowd about a life-changing experience at an EDM show at the Palladium. In the middle of it, he said, “I decided that I wanted to do this for the rest of my life.” Then they dropped “Closer” and for the hundredth time that night the crowd exploded. Metallica. Photo by Charley Gallay/Getty Images for Citi. On its final night, Citi Sound Vault turned up the volume and got much more headbanger-y with a set by Metallica. The band got straight to business with the savage title cut from their latest album Hardwired... To Self Destruct and the crowd responded by immediately starting a mosh pit in the middle of the floor. Forgoing any stage decoration besides their amps, the band tore through a set heavy on Metallica classics while crowd surfing fans literally rode the waves of excitement running through the room. According to drummer Lars Ulrich, the band’s unofficial historian, the last time they’d played the Palladium was all the way back in March of 1985. Metallica’s done a lot since then, but with the ferocity they brought to the performance it was easy to close your eyes and imagine you were back at that gig over 30 years ago. After thrilling fans with hits like “One,” Master of Puppets,” and “Enter Sandman,” they returned to the stage to for an encore that peaked with “Seek And Destroy” from their debut album Kill ‘Em All . “Did you have some fun tonight?” Hetfield asked the audience towards the song’s end, and they roared back in approval. “So did we,” he said. After leaving the stage on a triumphant note, Citi Sound Vault officially came to a close. As giddy, sweat-drenched fans emptied out of the Palladium into the cool California air, one beaming headbanger summed up the whole week succinctly. “I’ve never seen anything like it,” he said.
