Delta Air Lines will make major changes at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International… more Delta Air Lines photo “These enhancements reflect the solid demand from both business and leisure travelers,” said Joe Esposito , Delta’s vice president for its network in the Americas. “We are proud to serve our Cincinnati customers as the No. 1 airline connecting Cincinnati to the world.” Delta announced several major changes: More than 75 percent of all flights will operate with aircraft that have a first-class section, the most ever at CVG. All Minneapolis flights will have first-class cabins. The number of seats available to the 35 cities served by Delta will increase by 6 percent. Schedules will be tweaked with business travelers in mind, with more destinations having flights that leave in the morning and return in the evening so companies can leave and return to Cincinnati in the same day. That change will be made for Philadelphia; Newark, N.J.; Charlotte, N.C. and Hartford, Conn. It will add flights to five markets: Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, Orlando and Toronto. On peak days Delta will offer 82 departures to 25 destinations including international flights to Paris-Charles deGaulle International Airport, Cancun and Toronto. CVG CEO Candace McGraw hailed the move by CVG’s largest carrier. \"CVG is pleased to see Delta's capacity growth and schedule enhancements,\" McGraw said. \"Delta's local CVG passenger volume has grown for 15 consecutive months and these changes will certainly help continue that trend while benefiting business and leisure customers in our region.\" Wetterich covers government and politics, transportation and downtown development.
