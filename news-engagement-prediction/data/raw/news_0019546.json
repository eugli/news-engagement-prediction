We are launching our three satellites. One is of 730 kgs while other two are 19 kgs each. We had additional space of 600 kgs. So we decided to accommodate 101 satellites,\" ISRO chairman A S Kiran Kumar said. \n\"Roughly half of our cost will be covered by the foreign satellites we are launching,\" he said, without revealing the exact amount ISRO will earn from foreign customers. \nWith the launch of foreign satellites, ISRO has managed to earn more than USD 100 million. It also has achieved mastery on launching smaller satellites. \nThese 101 satellites are nano-satellites and belong to foreign nations, including the US and Germany. \nThe Indian satellites are from the Cartosat series. \nLast year, ISRO launched record 20 satellites at one go. The highest number of satellites launched in a single mission is 37, a record that Russia set in 2014. The US space agency NASA launched 29. \nKumar said ISRO is at present doing tests on its lander for Chandrayaan 2 at its facility in Mahendragiri in Tamil Nadu and Challakere in Karnataka. \n\"It is an indigenous development and tests are on. It's a control descend. So it has engines that allow a control descend,\" Kumar said. \nChandrayaan 2 mission seeks to make a landing on the moon. \nThe ISRO said that all SAARC countries, except Pakistan, have given their consent for the South Asian satellites project envisioned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as \"India's gift to its neighbours\". \nKumar said that the manned mission project is \"not a top priority\" for the ISRO, as he emphasised on enhancing space infrastructure. \n(With PTI inputs) First Published: Tuesday, February 7, 2017 - 21:03 More from zeenews", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T04:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T09:38:28.655+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
