After demonetisation, banks were flush with funds and everyone was expecting them to lower deposit rates also. But that has thankfully not happened so far and some banks are even offering up to 9% interest on their fixed deposits.\nPeople who are not willing to take risk and also want to gain high interest rates on their investments can invest in these fixed deposits. Investing money in fixed deposit ensures a guaranteed return for a particular period of time, which means that it is an instrument where you exactly know the worth of your invested amount.\nFixed deposits are also known as term deposits, so one should not get confused between the two terms. Generally, FD’s give you a return ranging from 7% to 8%, but some banks have started giving 9% return on an investment made for 12 months or less than 24 months.\nAre bank FD’s insured?\nBank FD’s are safer than post office saving instruments because their investments are covered under DICGC (Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation) were investments are insured up to Rs 1 lakh. Protecting the interest of consumers, every bank is covered under DICGC.\nYou may also watch:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:54:35.807+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
