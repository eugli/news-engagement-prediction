The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) announced a 15-member team to be led by Mushfiqur Rahim, but the side has no Mustafizur Rahman. \nRahman, 21, is regarded as one of the best pace bowlers around, and his absence will be a huge blow to the tourists when they take on Virat Kohli's World Number 1 ranked Test side in India. The left-arm pacer is currently recuperating from a shoulder injury, for which he underwent a successful operation. \nHe had the operation in August last year in London. Then, the BCB said that the pace sensation will remain off the pitch for at least four months. Known for his lethal cutters, Rahman emerged as one of the leading pacers last year, performing exceedingly well for Bangladesh in the Asia Cup and ICC Twenty20. \nHe was played a prominent role in Sunrisers Hyderabad's Indian Premier League triumph last season. \nSkipper Rahim recovered from a head injury he suffered during the New Zealand Test series, and is cleared to the lead the side. Besides Rahim, Imrul Kayes and Mominul Haque were also included in the team after clearing the fitness test. \nOther change in the team is the return of Liton Das, who recently scored a 219 in the first round of the Bangladesh Cricket League. He replaced Nurul Hasan.
