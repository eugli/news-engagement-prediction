The IPOB said all that Kanu prophesied about Nigeria is currently manifesting. The group in a statement released by its spokesperson Powerful Emma said: “The indigenous people of Biafra IPOB and it's leadership worldwide wants to use this medium to remind Nigeria government and Nigerians what is about to befall on the contraption called Nigeria in the near future.” Emma also said that God is angry with Nigeria because its government has continued to detain Kanu. “The Almighty God the Chukwu Okike Abiama is angry with Nigeria government and their failure to heed for the total release his prophet mazi Nnamdi Kanu. There's a saying that a Prophet is not recognized even in his own kingdom. “Mazi Nnamdi Kanu the leader of the Indigenous people of Biafra took the entire globe by storm when he elected to be the voice of the voiceless nation Biafra,” Emma said. He added that: “A lot of people both at home and in diaspora saw his moves and determination as a huge joke of the century. Many saw him as another youth seeking for relevance.” Many saw him as hungry man who wants to earn a living through defrauding the vulnerable. Nobody took the messenger and the message serious. The Nigerian state saw him as a rascal that must be tamed. Some of the people within the Biafran enclave saw in him as an unassuming and over ambitious young man. People never believed in the spiritual realities that the affairs which Mazi Nnamdi Kanu is incharge spearheading are still governed by the creator of the universe, which is God Almighty Chukwu Okike Abiama.

The Nigerian nation in their usual way instead of discussing and negotiating took a dangerous path of arrest and detention. Looking at the state of affairs in Nigeria since the arrest and detention, one can confidently say that Mazi Nnamdi Kanu is now a Prophet of God. “Is there anything he said that has not come to pass? Does Nigeria government still wait till all he has said comes to pass? That may spell doom for Nigeria and its people. The truth remains that things have fallen apart and the centre can longer hold. The continued detention and incarceration of Nnamdi Kanu in the prison is not an option. The group said, all that is happening in Nigerian since the past one year, is an evidence of the spirituality of Biafra and its leadership.

Again, Nigeria government and the citizens should not wait like in the case of Pharaoh till the nation receives the last plague before doing the needful. God is not a man that he should lie. Nnamdi Kanu is divinely sent on a mission and must be seen as such. No harm must befall the prophet of God.
