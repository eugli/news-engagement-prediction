Now the honorable minister has listed Prime Minister’s residence at 7 Racecourse Road (Now known as 7 Lok Kalyan Marg) on Airbnb for the next month. Now you can live like the PM! Book now! \nVoting in the important state of Uttar Pradesh begins on 11th of February and the results will get announced on 11th of March along with 4 pother states. Due to the importance of this election, PM Modi is expected to address a number of rallies in the state and is not expected back at the PM residence till the voting gets over. To capitalize on this 1 month window, FM Jaitley has listed the house at Airbnb to get some additional money in Government’s coffers. \nThis is not the first time that the PM residence has been rented out, earlier the government had rented it out for wedding functions. With marriage season almost over, they have decided to list it on Airbnb to attract the tourists coming to Delhi. \nSpeaking to Faking News, a senior official in Finance ministry said ,”Well, the house was going to remain vacant for a month so why not rent it out to travelers? As you know, our Finance Minister is always focused on increasing government revenue and a huge property like the PM residence is expected to bring in a lot of money. We can accommodate dozens of people there at the same time, in a really luxurious home. Our experts are predicting that we will remain fully booked throughout the month.” \n“Public should be happy since we are focusing on making money through other means now instead of introducing some cess all the time. PM won’t care since he will be in UP all this while, nobody is upset and government makes money. This is the best possible way we feel”, he further added. \nInspired by this, Manish Sisodia has also listed Arvind Kejriwal’s official home on Airbnb.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T14:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T09:24:47.876+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
