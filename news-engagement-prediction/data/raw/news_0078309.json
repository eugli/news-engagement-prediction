Kate Middleton joined the rest of the royal family at Buckingham Palace on Monday night to celebrate Britain’s cultural ties with India. The Duchess of Cambridge literally shined at the reception in a metallic, mid-length dress by Erdem, pairing it with sparkling Oscar de la Renta heels. In honor of the occasion, she wore earrings by Indian designer Anita Dongre , whose pieces she also wore while playing cricket during her visit to India in May 2016. As with many American First Ladies , the Duchess is no stranger to fashion diplomacy. While visiting Bhutan during that same trip , she wore a red gown with a floral print by Beulah London , honoring Bhutan’s national flower, the Himalayan blue poppy, as well as a traditional Bhutanese skirt from Kelzang Handicraft , which specializes in Bhutanese textiles and crafts. She also made headlines for her highly coveted blue-and-white dress by Indian designer Naeem Khan ( a favorite of First Lady Michelle Obama ) while visiting the Taj Mahal. Simply said, Middleton has no trouble making diplomatic statements through her wardrobe. 1 / 17 All of Kate Middleton’s Looks on the 2016 India Tour Kate closed things out in typical (impossible-to-even-conceive-of-that’s-how-good-and-effortless-it-is) style, wearing this Naeem Khan to the Taj Mahal, for her final look of the tour.

But, oh no, ever the professional, the Duchess pulled off winning looks down the very end. Photo: From Getty Images. Only Kate Middleton could complete a three-hour hike and look completely non-fatigued afterwards. She looks fresher than most people do on the red carpet! Photo: From Rex/Shutterstock. The Beulah dress features Bhutan’s national flower, the poppy, and is called “Juliet” ( of course she would wear a dress named “Juliet”). Photo: By Mark Lange/Getty Images. This was Kate’s first full-on formal outfit of the tour, a blue Jenny Packham dress for a black-tie gala, on the first night of her trip. If you were planning to go to a fancy event anytime soon and not wear an embroidered shawl, you are going to look like an out-of-touch fool, frankly.

I wear a cool patterned dress while playing sports, and still look immaculate.” Photo: By Chris Jackson/Getty Images. Try to imagine you have just flown from the U.K. to India—you’re probably jet-lagged, disoriented, otherwise exhausted. And then, at that moment, you have to get dressed up and wear something fancy and be photographed by hundreds of people. Kate manages to pull that off without breaking so much as a (metaphorical, as well as literal, probably) sweat, in this patterned, red Alexander McQueen dress.
