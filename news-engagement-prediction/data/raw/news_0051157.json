That proved to maybe be an unwise decision by Belichick, as the man keeps winning titles and, thus, keeps having to update the name and paint job on his dang boat. \nWhen he first purchased the vessel, it was named “V Rings” to reflect the three championships he won as head coach of the Patriots, plus the two he secured as an assistant with the New York Giants. But then the Pats defeated the Seahawks in Super Bowl XLIX and the coach had to make a change. Bill Belichick renamed & repainted his boat this summer. It looks stunning. #VIRings pic.twitter.com/ZI10pFCwAG \n— Only In Boston (@OnlyInBOS) July 17, 2015 \nNow, with the Patriots’ incredible comeback victory in Super Bowl LI earlier this month, another change became necessary. If we’re to believe a picture that has surfaced on the Internet this week, Belichick wasted little time in making the appropriate updates.
