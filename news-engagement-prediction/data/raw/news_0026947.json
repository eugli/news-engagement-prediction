Dakota Access Pipeline will be built after all after Trump gives it the go-ahead \nActivists opposed to the construction of the $3.7billion oil pipeline remain camped on the construction site, and the veterans’ support could make it harder for the police to displace them. \nSome also hope that it will stop the state’s militarised police force from using excessive force on demonstrators. \n‘We are prepared to put our bodies between Native elders and a privatised military force,’ Elizabeth Williams, a 34-year-old air force veteran, told the paper. \n‘We’ve stood in the face of fire before. We feel a responsibility to use the skills we have.’ Dozens of veterans have been standing with the Standing Rock Sioux (Picture: Reuters) Demonstrators have camped on-site (Picture: Reuters) \nIt’s believed hundreds of veterans are currently en route to the site to protect the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. \nThe tribe fears that the pipeline could pollute the Missouri River, which is their main source of drinking water. \nThe pipeline’s construction would also destroy several sites that are sacred to the Standing Rock Sioux. \n‘We’re not coming as fighters, but as protectors,’ Jake Pogue, a 32-year-old marine corps veteran, added.
