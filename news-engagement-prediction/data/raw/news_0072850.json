Thankfully, the fire was put out quickly and no one was hurt. However, a hotel staff member uploaded pictures of them evacuating on their personal Instagram, and fans accused them of leaving Kyuhyun at the burning hotel. \nKyuhyun spoke up about the incident and tweeted, “There seems to be a misunderstanding about the fire in Taiwan. My manager, my staff, and I were in my room preparing for the comments I would be making at the concert, and we missed the right timing to evacuate. Then we heard that the fire was put out and decided to just stay in the room instead of breathing in the smoke while walking down the stairs.” 대만 화재로 오해가 있는것 같아서요.. 짧게 얘기 하자면 저는 매니저&스텝들과 그시간까지 공연 멘트정리를 위해서 방에 남아 있다가 대피할 타이밍이 늦어졌는데 화재는 진압되었다는 얘길듣고 나서 계단 내려가며 화재 연기를 마시느니 방에 남는걸 제가 택했고 \n— ChoKyuHyun (@GaemGyu) February 25, 2017 \n“Besides the people in my room, all of the other staff members followed the hotel’s instructions and waited outside for three hours. It was my mistake to have stayed in my room thinking that it wasn’t a big deal. I do not want bad feelings to arise after a great concert. Good night!” 제 방의 인원을 제외한 전 스텝들은 호텔 지시에 따라 내려가서 밖에서 3시간가량 대기 했습니다.. 문제가 있다면 별일 아니겠지 하며 남아서 계속 스텝들과 작업했던 제가 문제인것 같아요 좋은 공연 후에 논란이 생기는건 원치 않습니다..좋은 밤 보내세요!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T14:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T10:08:28.632+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
