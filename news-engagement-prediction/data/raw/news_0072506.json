I&apos;ve always considered myself an ally to LGBT causes and it was an opportunity to put that empathy into action. And what I decided was that if I was respectful to Tarell&apos;s [Tarell Alvin, who wrote the play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue,  on which the film is based] voice, if I preserved his voice, then this was a way that I, as a straight man, could bring a queer story into the world and do it with the same nuance and subtlety and respect that someone who had the first-person experience would.” \nWithout the presence of La La Land— a film can only be nominated if it was made for less than $20 million—many observers expected Moonlight to sweep Saturday’s awards. And while the show is rarely an arbiter for Oscar success, it’s clear that industry love for Jenkins’ masterpiece is still running strong.\nOther winners Saturday included Casey Affleck ( Manchester By The Sea) and Isabelle Huppert ( Elle ), who won Best Actor and Best Actress\\, respectively. Robert Eggers won Best First Screenplay and Best First Feature for his chilling period horror The Witch, while ESPN’s universally acclaimed O.J.: Made in America beat out Ava DuVernay’s equally hailed 13th for Best Documentary. \nWatch Now Tags: News , Videos , Awards , Independent Movies , Movies , Moonlight", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T04:17:08.850+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
