Every single one of these presidents you see passing before you, they all had problems. But nothing like what we’re seeing from this presidency or this administration,” said organizer Christina Chapman from the anti-Trump protest group Rise and Resist. \nActivists led protest ers in a series of mourning ‘hymnals’ sung to the tune of iconic songs such as “Somewhere Over the rainbow” and “Amazing Grace,” but with completely revised lyrics that denounced Trump and his administration. \nREAD MORE: Donald Trump renews campaign vows, declares war on media in Florida rally \n“Somewhere over the rainbow, Kellyann — Steve and Don are in prison, preferably in Iran,” sang protest ers, in reference to Trump and his key advisors, Kellyann Conway and Steve Bannon . \nProtest ers then led the casket around the park with jazz and marching band music much like traditional New Orleans funerals. \nSince his Jan. 20 inauguration, Trump has faced a steady stream of protest s and marches, highlighted by mass rallies focused on women’s rights that drew millions of people around the globe on the day after he was sworn in. \nBut on Friday, a second consecutive day of protest s against Trump’s month-old administration appeared to lose momentum, with rallies in Chicago, Los Angeles and New York attracting small yet enthusiastic crowds. © 2017 Thomson Reuters ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T04:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T04:26:48.484+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
