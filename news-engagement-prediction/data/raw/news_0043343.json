Marchers hold signs as they march down Lincolnway in Valparaiso Saturday to a rally for immigrant and civil rights in front of the Valparaiso City Hall. (Kyle Telechan / Post-Tribune) Privacy Policy \nThe message of the March for a Welcoming Valparaiso on Saturday was a clear one. \n\"This must be the beginning of a movement that says we will not tolerate those who can't love us because of our differences,\" the Rev. Cheryl Rivera, executive director of the Northwest Indiana Federation of Interfaith Organizations, told the crowd at Valparaiso City Hall. \"(Valparaiso) is big enough for all of us. Let's enlarge the circle.\" \nThe event, in which more than 250 people walked from Valparaiso University to City Hall on an unseasonably warm day, was triggered by President Donald Trump 's executive order that sought to prevent immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States, organizers said. The order is on hold as it works its way through the federal court system. \nWith signs that read, \"No ban, no wall, no hate,\" and \"Resist fear, teach peace,\" the marchers chanted their way down Lincolnway with an occasional chorus of, \"A country united shall never be divided.\" Several drivers honked as they passed by. \nLakshmi Raman, of Valparaiso, a native of Madras, India, said she felt it was important to take part in the event. \n\"I want to show that Valparaiso has been welcoming for me,\" she said. \"I've been here 18 years and this sends the right message for the city.\" \nOrganizer Candace Shaw, of Valparaiso, said she was motivated to put the march together after hearing in recent weeks from first and second generation Americans who are afraid because of what's going on in this country. She cited a recent report by the Southern Poverty Law Center that shows the number of hate groups is on the rise. \nAs she addressed marchers from the steps of City Hall, Shaw said she wanted those in attendance to carry the speakers' stories with them in their daily lives, to empathize with them. \n\"It's not enough to march on one day and move right back to the status quo,\" she said. \"Today is not the ending. It is the beginning.\" \nShe told marchers at the start of the event and again when they reached City Hall not to engage with hecklers and to stay positive with their words and actions. \nWhen a heckler tried to interrupt Janet French, officiant for Unitarian Universalist Church in Hobart, during a responsive reading, the crowd raised their voices to drown him out with, \"We come together to take a stand for a welcoming Valparaiso.\" \nJesus, from the time of his birth, was a refugee when Joseph and Mary were warned to flee to Egypt, the Rev. Timothy of Trinity Lutheran Church in Valparaiso said. \n\"If God has to depend on us not to get killed, we certainly need to also,\" he said. \"People who are fleeing war zones and terrorists are not terrorists. People who are looking for a job are not terrorists. They are looking for a job.\" \nThe CEOs of Google, Apple, Tesla, Yahoo and Microsoft are immigrants or the children of immigrants, said Ferass Safadi, who graduated from Valparaiso High School and went on to get a degree from Loyola University. He and his wife are raising five children in Valparaiso, he said. \n\"It's the normal life of every single American except for one thing. I was born to immigrant parents. Muslim parents. Syrian parents,\" he said. \"I am here to reaffirm what I saw in Valparaiso my whole life. It's a welcoming city.\" \nImmigrants like his father, a physician, often leave everything behind and start with nothing when they arrive here. As a doctor in the region for more than 40 years, Safadi said his father \"has served and healed more than 240,000 residents.\" \n\"He is proud to be a Muslim, and we are all proud to be American Muslims and American Jews and American Christians and not live in fear,\" he said. A policy of dividing the country to conquer it will not work because of the judicial system's system of checks and balances, he said. \nAs the hour-long rally wound down, Shaw introduced a surprise speaker, Nour Ulayyet, who garnered international attention when her sister was denied entry to the United States from Syria on Jan. 27, the day Trump's executive order went into effect. Sahar Algonaimi was en route to the U.S. to help care for her sick mother. \n\"Thank you (for) every single prayer that came our way,\" said Ulayyet, of Valparaiso. With help from the community, U.S. Rep. Pete Visclosky , D-Merrillville, and U.S. Sen. Joe Donelly, D-South Bend, \"my sister was able to come back here and is visiting with my mother.\" \nAmy Lavalley is a freelance reporter for the Post-Tribune.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T04:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T01:03:08.140+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
