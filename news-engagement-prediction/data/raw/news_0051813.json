Photo Philip Roth Credit Fred R. Conrad/The New York Times He keeps Roosevelt from a third term in a blowout election, carrying 46 states and winning 57 percent of the popular vote. The widespread antiwar sentiment in the country at the time is turned, in Roth’s version, into a winning hand. But before embarking on further discussion of a novel about America that has a swastika on its cover, perhaps some caveats would be wise. When “Plot” was published, Roth wrote an essay in The New York Times Book Review, in which he emphasized that his interest was in revisiting 1940-1942, not in commenting on George W. Bush’s America or any other version of the country. He wrote the book “not so as to illuminate the present through the past but to illuminate the past through the past.” After the election of Donald J. Trump, which even to many on the left made the George W. Bush presidency seem deeply traditional, even boring, Roth told The New Yorker in January: “Writers here don’t live enslaved in a totalitarian police state, and it would be unwise to act as if we did.” However much readers might crave it, no novel offers a neat parallel between its pages and the real world. Still, what parallels do exist in Roth’s novel are striking. As today, when many urge President Trump to denounce attacks on synagogues and mosques, observers in “The Plot Against America” worry about those emboldened by “a provocateur cynically encouraging American citizens who needed in no way to feel besieged to cling to their oldest, most crippling anxieties.” \nAdvertisement Continue   In the novel, synagogues have windows broken and walls defaced. One is firebombed. The government positions its policies as efforts at greater assimilation, with the Office of American Absorption drawing up programs like Homestead 42, in which Jews from places like Newark are sent to live and work in places like Kentucky. The goal is to weaken Jewish communities and “diminish whatever electoral strength” they might have. Photo Mr. Roth’s novel. Characters — particularly the family’s father, Herman Roth, a firm supporter of Roosevelt — say things that could be lifted from today’s Twitter feeds. “How can this be happening in America?” Herman asks. “How can people like these be in charge of our country? If I didn’t see it with my own eyes, I’d think I was having a hallucination.” And later: “The man is unfit. He shouldn’t be there. He shouldn’t be there, and it’s as simple as that!” Lindbergh in the novel is clearly an outlier in political life. But in other ways, Roth perhaps rightfully saw 1940s America as a place where several conventional criteria would have to be met if highly unconventional ideas were to land in the White House. Lindbergh, with his “relative youth” and “graceful athleticism,” represents “normalcy raised to heroic proportions, a decent man with an honest face and an undistinguished voice.” He’s even said to possess an “affable blandness.” Lindbergh’s diplomatic relationship with Germany mirrors in some aspects the unusual dynamic involving Trump, his administration and Russia. Americans in the book, as they are now, are left to wonder about exactly why certain global relationships have warmed. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.
