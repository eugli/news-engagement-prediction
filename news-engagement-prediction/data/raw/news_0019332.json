Responsible business practices are starting to spread in eastern Congo. This action could reverse that progress.” \nGlobal Witness said the action, if taken by the White House, would be tantamount to an “abuse of power,” and that suspending Dodd-Frank “could actually undermine U.S. national security.” \nThe first section of the memorandum instructs the Securities and Exchange Commission to suspend for two years “all … reporting and disclosure requirements” that force companies to report whether materials used in their products originated from the DRC or its adjoining territories, as is required under Section 1502 of Dodd-Frank . \nThe second section of the presidential memoranda instructs the SEC to waive enforcement of the Conflicts Mining Rule, officially known as Section 13p-1 of the Exchange Act and part of Dodd-Frank, which requires companies to report if any “conflict materials” are necessary for the production of their products or in their functionality. The order maintains that this requirement poses a threat to national security. \nFinally, the order requests the secretaries of state and treasury to craft plans for “addressing human rights violations and funding of armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country.” \n“The plan could include targeting persons and entities engaged in violations of law and negative human rights impacts,” as defined by Section 13 of the Exchange Act, the order says. Trump has asked the secretaries to provide his office with a plan within 180 days. \nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nBelow is a full copy of the leaked draft order:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T04:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T02:05:56.131+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
