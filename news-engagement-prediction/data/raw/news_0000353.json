There’s that death stare. (Pic: Kym Smith) \nI have a dream. \nActually I have many, but I suspect no one’s interested in the one about pork belly and a certain Shia LaBeouf in a cage. \nIn this little daydream, Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop shirtfronts US President Donald Trump. Not shirt-front in that hairy-chested Abbott kind of way, but in the blue-eyed death-stare kind of way. \nPulls him up, swiftly. Julie Bishop would not take any crap from Donald Trump. (Pic: Kym Smith) \n“Grab Her By The Pussy” Trump thinks Australia — steadfast ally, sometimes sycophantic friend — doesn’t matter. He allegedly chucked a tanty during a phone call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull , saying it was “the worst call of the day by far, including Putin”. He accused Australia of trying to export terrorists to the US. \n(The deal on the table actually involves confirmed refugees, currently languishing on Manus Island and Nauru).
