Yet, those are last week's statistics. \n\"It's probably higher now,\" Pierce said over coffee Monday, his voice still tinged with a Boston accent after close to three decades in Dallas. And it will inch higher still, week after week, until the school year's end. My old DISD high school is failing the state's test, but meet a teacher who could save it \nBut, it's important to note that number is also incomplete. That 3,700 figure — rising and little short of catastrophic — does not include the 1,000 or so kids who aren't officially registered to attend classes. The numbers, Pierce has said, rival those not seen since families from areas ravaged by Hurricane Katrina sought refuge in Dallas 12 summers ago. \nThese are the homeless not counted during Metro Dallas Homeless Alliance's annual point-in-time count , the results of which will be released next month, or by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. They live not on the streets, but just on the edges of the shadows — in cars and seedy motels, on friends' floors, on cots in garages. Not long ago, Pierce had a couple of kids interning for him who lived in an abandoned home where their mother dropped them off when she decided it would be easier to find room in a shelter without her boys tagging along. \n\"They're not counted as homeless by HUD\" now, Pierce told the Dallas City Council last week. \"But they will very soon, because they will not have any place to go.\" \nI've heard Pierce speak twice in recent weeks to the Dallas City Council as it continues to wring its hands over whether to form a citizens homeless commission or a city-county agency ... or both or neither, who knows. I caught him in January; we finally sat down this week. He has better things to do, like spending the day driving around town collecting donations or educating educators about how to identify homeless students and how to help those kids who would prefer to keep their stories secret. \n\"My solution — my take, and that's only because of where I am — is we need to educate them,\" Pierce said. \"We need to get them to school. Because I believe public school is the greatest gift this country has.\" Mark Pierce is the program manager for DISD's homeless education program — and the only person whose full-time job entails finding hope for kids without any. (Nathan Hunsinger/Staff Photographer) \nWhich should be the least controversial thing you'll ever read. Until you remember that the new secretary of education has called public schools a \"dead end.\" \nThe kids' stories are similar only in the depths of their tragedy and despair. Many have been kicked out of their homes by single parents who can't afford to feed an extra mouth. Or they're fleeing abusive stepfathers. Or a single parent has been taken to jail or killed or hospitalized for mental illness. Pierce estimates that a significant percentage of the district's homeless kids are LGBT and were booted by parents who believe \"they're influencing the younger children,\" he said. \nThere is, he said, one commonality among the students who do not know where they will sleep on any given night: \"They're terrified.\" \nThe number is staggering, yes; shameful, of course. \"Heartbreaking,\" too, Mayor Mike Rawlings said last week, after Pierce made his second trip to Dallas City Hall in two months. \nPierce had come, again, to plead his case for more assistance from a City Council that continues to think it can solve Dallas' unsheltered crisis by talking it to death . \nBoth times Pierce has been to Dallas City Hall, he's asked for only two things: emergency shelters for women and children, and a handful of beds under roofs for kids in their late teens — 17-year-olds, at least, though 14 and up would be preferable. The response thus far has been silence, inaction, the same old dunno shrug. In 1998, Pierce was in charge of DISD's then-brand-new homeless after-school program. Nineteen years later, he's dealing with a brewing catastrophe, and he's in need of more than a guitar. (File Photo/Staff) \n\"Fifteen years ago, I could call Dallas Life and get them in that night, the day of,\" Pierce said Monday. \"Family Gateway, too. And Salvation Army. A multitude of places. Now, I am getting calls from counselors and nurses three times a week, at least, begging for emergency shelters. And now, there's no room for them.\" \nPierce told the council that he is tapped out of ideas. He told me that he is also running out of time to help kids about to slip forever out of his grasp. And should this continue, should the homeless student population continue to expand against a backdrop of dwindling resources, we are headed to an inevitable outcome. \n\"Dickensian England,\" he said. \"We'll end up with that. It's a huge problem, but that's what I think we're facing — Oliver Trust , Hard Times .\" Swell, more books to add to 2017's already grim reading list, alongside Animal Farm , The Handmaid's Tale , It Can't Happen Here as the present slides further and faster toward the dystopian future we were warned about in the not-so-distant past. Homeless teens find shelter from stormy lives at North Dallas High School \nThe news is not entirely grim: For the past four years, the district has made strides toward identifying and assisting homeless students via drop-in centers that open once a week on a dozen high school campuses and in a few junior highs. There, students can stop by before classes to eat breakfast, pick up hygiene products, jackets, even sleeping bags and pillows. \nThe first was at North Dallas High School in 2012, when there were some 76 homeless students there; that number has more than doubled since then. But North Dallas has something the other campuses do not: a partner in nearby Church of the Incarnation, whose Incarnation House welcomes at-risk students for a few hours after school each day and offers meals, tutoring and mentoring, art and music classes, job training, life skills. \nThe program is, by all accounts, a godsend. But it's also incomplete: Every night, the doors close; and every night, those kids have to find a place to sleep. \nWhich is why Pierce suggested, over and over during our sit-down, the creation of emergency shelters near every high school, where kids can safely sleep and shower before school. He said these shelters could be in the basement of a church or in a vacant strip-mall storefront or anywhere, it doesn't matter, even if it's just \"a night at a time.\" \nHe knows what the response will be: Not in my backyard. But it's too late for that. Homeless students, like the encampments filled with grown-ups, are already in every neighborhood; I know of several kids living in motels a couple of miles from my house in northwest Dallas. \n\"I don't get why we can't make kids' live enjoyable — bearable,\" Pierce said. \"When I look at the adult world, I am extremely cynical. But when I look at the kids, I wonder, why are we expecting them to be adults? Why are we expecting them to muscle through? Why are we expecting them to shut up and get along? They're kids .\" View Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:53:29.365+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
