He was sentenced to life in prison for the grisly shooting of his pregnant wife, Belinda Lucas Temple, in 1999. \nOn Monday, Ogg said she needed more time to review the massive file before deciding whether or not David Temple would be retried. She also said she had not ruled out giving the case to a special prosecutor. \n\"There's been a number of requests, from the victim's family and their supporters, for us to recuse ourselves,\" she said. \"It's all under consideration.\" \nShe said she was looking at whether the office has a conflict of interest, or the appearance of a conflict. And if the decision is made for a re-trial, she said she is weighing whether a special prosecutor should do that. \n\"It's an important case to me,\" said Ogg, who took office Jan. 1. \"It's an important case in terms of how prosecutors behaved under the past administrations and how that affects future prosecutions. That's why I'm handling it personally.\" \nVictim advocate Andy Kahan issued a statement Monday saying the Lucas family wants Ogg to give the case to a special prosecutor. \n\"There is no doubt in our minds that David Temple is guilty of the cold-blooded murder of Belinda and her unborn 8 month-old baby Erin,\" Kahan said in an email. \"In light of the current situation we firmly believe that it is best for all concerned that an independent prosecutor be appointed to give a semblance of fairness and balance. The evidence that was used to convict Temple remains the same, therefore there is no legitimate reason not to try him again.\" \nHe said the family is hopeful and \"praying that Belinda and Erin will once again have their day in court and justice will prevail.\" \nThe controversial case has been simmering since Ogg took office, but it came to a boil Monday after media reports emerged that she was holding a fundraiser later this week with a group of defense attorneys, inclulding Temple's former attorney, a day before a scheduled hearing in the Temple case. \nOgg said she wanted to defend herself against the implications. \n\"Elected officials from the White House to the courthouse accept political contributions and the law requires us to disclose them and that keeps the process transparent,\" she said. \"But my decision's not for sale. Never has been. Never will be.\" \nShe said she has made no promises about jobs in her administration or results in cases. \n\"I want to assure the public that I am committed to an evidence-based style of prosecution and that's what drives me,\" she said. \"That's why a thorough review of the evidence is so important.\" \nShe said Friday's hearing in the Temple case would be postponed for at least 60 days while she continues her review. \nThe fundraiser, set for Thursday downtown, is being hosted by several lawyers, including Temple's trial attorney, Dick DeGuerin who has long maintained that Temple is innocent. Donation amounts for the fundraiser range from $100 to $2,500. \nBoth DeGuerin and Temple's current attorney, Stan Schneider, said Ogg should keep the case and make the decision. \n\"There's enough people in Ms. Ogg's office that had nothing to do with the Temple case,\" Schneider said. \"They can review the offense report, all the evidence, review transcripts and make a decision.\" \nDeGuerin said Monday that the fundraiser, and his support for Ogg have never been tied to Temple's case. \n\"I supported Kim Ogg before she was elected and I support her now,\" he said. \"I'm not bashful about supporting her but it had absolutely nothing to do with the Temple case.\" \nHe said he gave Ogg money during her campaign and is helping her now because he has known her for years. \n\"A political contribution is not going to influence her one way or another,\" he said. \nDeGuerin said he has donated money and, in this case, lent his name to the steering committee for the fundraiser. He noted there is no rule or law prohibiting district attorneys or other elected officials, like judges, from soliciting money from the lawyers in the their court. \nIn fact, most elected officials in the criminal justice system take thousands of dollars from lawyers who may practice in their court or be an adversary in a legal proceeding. \n\"It's the lawyers who practice in the criminal justice system that know who's good and who's not good,\" he said. \"And they're the ones who support good judges and good district attorneys and good county attorneys. That's the kind of system that we have.\" \nProminent defense attorney Kent Schaffer, who is also listed as a host for the fundraiser, agreed that lawyers have long donated to judges and district attorneys in Texas. \n\"You trust your public officials to have more integrity than to be influenced by a $500 contribution,\" he said. He said he had been invited to two judicial fundraisers this week, because time is short for candidates to talk to their donors before the window to ask for money closes until next election season. \nSchaffer has not been connected to Temple, but said it looks like it will be dismissed. He said Ogg should consider handing the case off to a special prosecutor. \n\"The only thing Kim Ogg can do to avoid heat is to appoint a special prosecutor and let them take the heat,\" he said. \"Any special prosecutor worth a damn is going to look at the misconduct that occurred, the information that was never followed up on, the paltry evidence that they had before and they're going to dump the case.\" Latest from the Chron.com Homepage Click below for the top news from around the Houston area and beyond.
