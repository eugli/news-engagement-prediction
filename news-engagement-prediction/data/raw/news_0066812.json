They dream about going to Tokyo, and when they get there, they obsess over where to eat. And while Eater is here to help — our massive guide to Tokyo can point you to essentials; to the new and hot; to the best coffee, ramen, and affordable sushi — there's nothing like restaurant recommendations from chefs who are particular and passionate. \nEater asked 10 American-based chefs for their top Tokyo picks. On the map is a super-small tasting-menu temple ( Takazawa ), an eel-focused bonanza ( Ichinoya ), and a tempura shop that will have you questioning what hard work means ( Tempura Kondo ). There's also a serene dining room and tea salon tucked away in a residential neighborhood ( Yakumo Saryo ), a lunch destination where rice is king ( Ohitsuzen Tanbo ), and a noodle shop with a thing for Michael Jackson ( 2-Chome Tsukemen Gachi ). \nWithout further ado, and in geographical order, here's where chefs eat in Tokyo: 1 Yakumo Saryo (八雲茶寮) \nCortney Burns ( Motze , formerly of Bar Tartine , San Francisco): \"Dining at Yakumo Saryo is not only about eating a truly nourishing and satiating meal; its serene grace and elegance creates a relaxing experience for the entire soul. Set back in a residential neighborhood, the setting is quiet and unassuming. When you step through the white noren curtain, however, you'll be greeted with a full sensory experience. I had the tea pairing with my omakase lunch, beginning with a sparkling green tea perfumed with ume. Each dish, presented in the most perfect vessels, was balanced and refined — surprising and comforting at the same time. We were ushered into the tea room after the meal for matcha and sweets. I had hoshigaki (dried persimmon) stuffed with salted butter and a white bean paste bite with chestnut and puffed millet. Pure heaven.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T00:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:20:48.797+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
