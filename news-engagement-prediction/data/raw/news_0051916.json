'If Marine Le Pen comes in office,' he said. 'If she asks for a referendum on Frexit, what would Europe be about? 'Europe was founded precisely in order that France and Germany and others work together in a common project. 'But this won’t happen – it’s just to say how crazy it will be if she is elected – that is why precisely it cannot happen, it won’t happen, it must not happen.' European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici For this not to happen, he said the other candidates have to put together stronger campaigns in order to persuade citizens France has a bright future. He believes the rise in popularity of the right-wing candidate is a direct result in people being disappointed with the others in the race. But he still feels confident she will not succeed. 'I know my citizens and my compatriots,' he told CNBC . 'I know they are not going to elect a candidate that is proposing exiting not only the Euro, but Europe too, which would be crazy. 'That would be the end of the European project.' The 48-year-old hopeful made headlines today after cancelling a meeting with Lebanon’s most senior Muslim cleric – saying she objected to covering her hair with a headscarf. It adds to the controversy surrounding Le Pen, who is currently in the centre of a fake jobs conspiracy. During a campaign speech in Lyon earlier this month, Ms Le Pen pledged to ‘promote secularism’ as part of her anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant agenda. She is currently at the centre of a fake jobs corruption enquiry in France, but is expected to win the first round of voting in presidential elections in April. However, polls suggest that she will be well beaten in the second in May, when independent Emmanuelle Macron is expected to win.
