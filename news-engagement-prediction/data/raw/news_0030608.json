Charles Oakley (Getty Image) \nPublished on Feb. 11, 2017 \nFeb. 11, 2017 \nCharles Oakley admitted to drinking before Wednesday's incident at Madison Square Garden, and Knicks owner James Dolan's said he believes the former Knicks star has a drinking problem. \nDolan has said Oakley was not only \"terribly abusive\" towards people at the Garden but he also used \"racial overtones\" and \"sexual overtones\" towards the staff, which lead to his arrest. \nMORE: James Dolan sinks to new low in petty battle with Charles Oakley \n\"He may have a problem with alcohol, we don't know,\" Dolan said Friday on the The Michael Kay Show about Oakley. \n\"I'm sure he has problems,\" Dolan, a recovering addict himself, told the New York Post . \"I didn't have the problem he has, but when you're fighting addiction, it's not that much different from anger management or other diseases where you can't control yourself.\" Oakley told the New York Post in a separate interview Saturday that Dolan couldn't be more wrong about his drinking. Oakley said he visits treatment centers to support others, including former NBA player Jayson Williams. \n\"Dolan might think because I go to volunteer at Rebound Institute treatment centers with Jayson that I'm a client,'' Oakley told The Post. \"I'm just supporting the amazing work Jayson is doing. I'm not an alcoholic, but Jayson is.'' \nThe Knicks owner and MSG chairman said Friday that Oakley is banned from stepping foot inside MSG as a result of the altercation, which has owned headlines across the NBA and added yet another ring to the Knicks' circus this season. \nNBA players like LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, J.R. Smith and Chris Paul have expressed their support for Oakley, who spent 10 seasons with the Knicks and was an All-Star in 1994. Former Pacers guard Reggie Miller also supports Oakley and asked why any potential free agent would want to play for an owner who \"treats past greats like this.\" Watch This", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T10:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T11:21:48.880+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
