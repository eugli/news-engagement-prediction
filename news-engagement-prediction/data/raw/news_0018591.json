At least 52 people died and more than 100 others were injured in the Nov. 12 bomb blast at a remote Sufi shrine in Pakistan, officials said, with the Islamic State group claiming credit for the attack.\nBy Michael A. Cohen February 08, 2017\nSo Donald Trump thinks that the “very dishonest press” doesn’t want to report on terrorism.\nAccording to our president, the news media, including cable news networks — which, when it comes to terrorism, generally follow the standard applied to local crime of “if it bleeds, it leads” — are purposely playing down the issue. “They have their reasons, and you understand that,” Trump darkly suggested.\nAdvertisement\nThe White House tried to back up Trump’s bizarre assertion with a list of 78 terrorist incidents that they claim went underreported. The tally included the San Bernardino, Paris, and Orlando massacres, all of which will be familiar to most Americans because the media coverage of these incidents was ubiquitous.\nThe White House list is inane and comical, but in its composition it tells us everything we need to know about how the president and his advisers view terrorist incidents in the United States and around the world. Those perpetrated against Westerners and white people count far more than those against Muslims and brown and black people.\nGet This Week in Opinion in your inbox: Globe Opinion's must-reads, delivered to you every Sunday.

Only one bears inclusion on Trump’s list — a suicide bombing on a bus carrying guards who worked at the Canadian embassy.\nAdvertisement\nPakistan experienced 1,000 separate terrorist incidents in 2015. Trump’s list includes one: a knife attack in which a single US citizen was wounded.\nNotice anything similar about the victims in these two examples?\nIn that same year, 2015, Nigeria experienced nearly 600 separate terrorist attacks, which led to the deaths of more than 4,800 people.\nMost of these attacks were perpetrated by the radical jihadist group Boko Haram — and against innocent Nigerian civilians. These attacks rarely get any serious coverage in Western news outlets. Yet Nigeria goes unreferenced on the White House list.\nIn fact, nearly three-quarters of all terrorist deaths in 2015 occurred in just five countries — Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Syria, and Pakistan. Only two attacks from any of these countries are included in Trump’s list — and both were directed against Westerners.\nOddly, however, even though France experienced only 36 terrorist events in 2015 one out of 6 incidents on the White House lists references a terrorist attack in France. It’s as if the Trump White House wants to people believe that the terrorist threat facing Western countries is far greater than it really is.\nConversely, for the Trump administration, it seems, if a terrorist attack is carried out against Muslims, even if perpetrated by a jihadist terrorist organization — it doesn’t count.\nYet, beyond it’s clear racist intent, maybe the strangest thing about Trump’s fact-free accusation of bias in terrorism coverage is that, in fact, American media spend far too much time focusing on terrorism. Every major attack and even some of the minor ones — whether it occurs in France, Turkey, or the United States — receives omnipresent coverage. Terrorism and security experts are brought on cable news networks to hypothesize that America could be next. That Americans are at greater risk of being struck by lightning or crushed by furniture then they are to be killed by a jihadist terrorist is rarely mentioned. And the fact that the massacre of civilians in places like Iraq, Afghanistan, and Nigeria is rarely covered tells us all we need to know about how media organizations view terrorism coverage — if it’s white or Western and bleeds . . . it leads.\nIn fact, that so many of the incidents on the White House’s list received scant attention is actually a positive. If anything, we should be talking less about terrorism. Terrorism is not a serious threat to Americans, and wall-to-wall coverage of terrorist attacks scares people into believing they are at greater risk from terrorism than they really are. If you don’t live in one of the five countries where the majority of terrorist attacks occur, your chances of being killed by a terrorist are basically zero.\nThe president’s intent in talking about terrorism is not hard to discern: It’s cover for discriminatory and racist policies that play to his political base. But there’s no reason for the rest of us to play along.\nMichael A. Cohen’s column appears regularly in the Globe.
