Some didn't die because they are light. \n\"For the young ones, their weight wouldn't kill them. The officers' assistants would pull them down and break their necks.\" \nA former inmate added: \"The beating was so intense. It was as if you had a nail, and you were trying again and again to beat it into a rock. \n\"It was impossible, but they just kept going. I was wishing they would just cut off my legs instead of beating them any more.\" \nThe charity contacted the Syrian authorities but received no response, it said.
