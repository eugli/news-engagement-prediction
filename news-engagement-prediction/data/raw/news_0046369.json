There is no better time for those clean, vivid citrus flavours than now – frost on the hedges, the scent of lemon zest in the air.\nPuntarelle, grapefruit and capers Some great things going on in this simple salad. Crisp, slightly bitter leaves, such as chicory or the long, jagged-toothed shoots of puntarelle, work well when dressed with something mild and buttery, like this dressing of citrus juice, capers and butter. The simplicity has something of a catch to it here, the dressing being easy to get wrong. I sometimes need more than one go at it. The butter needs to be lightly browned before you add the clementine juice. This needs a careful eye if it isn’t to burn. You need the toasty, nutty notes of the browned butter.\nServes 4\npuntarelle or other bitter leaf 500g\ngrapefruit 1\nsmall orange 1 small\nclementines 2\nbutter 50g\ncapers 2 tsp, drained\nTrim the puntarelle, removing any dark leaves, then put the pale tubular stalks into iced water. Leave for at least 2 hours.\nSlice the ends from the grapefruit, sit it flat on a chopping board then slice away the peel and white pith with a knife. Be vigilant about removing the pith, as its bitterness can spoil the salad. Cut the grapefruit in half, then cut each half into thin slices. Do the same with the orange.\nDrain the puntarelle and pat it dry with kitchen paper or spin briefly in a salad spinner. Toss the puntarelle with the grapefruit and orange. Halve the clementines and squeeze the juice, then set aside.\nMake the dressing: melt the butter in a small, shallow pan, then, watching it carefully, leave it for three or four minutes until it starts to smell nutty. The butter should darken slightly in colour. As soon as the butter smells nutty, pour in the juice of the clementines, stir in the drained capers, then remove from the heat immediately.\nDivide the salad between four plates, then spoon over the butter, caper and clementine dressing.\nCeviche of sea bass and blood orange \nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ceviche of sea bass and blood orange. Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin for the Observer \nThe texture of the marinated sea bass will mostly depend on the length of time it spends in the dressing. Two hours is just long enough for the sea bass to be tender and toothsome. Any longer and it may become too soft and woolly.\nServes 4\nred onions 2\nradishes 10\njalapeños 2\nsea bass 4 fillets (about 550g total weight)\nlimes 3\nblood oranges 2\nsherry vinegar 2 tbsp\nPeel the onions, then slice them into rounds no thicker than 1cm and put them in large glass bowl. Thinly slice the radishes and the jalapeños, then add them to the onions.\n\nSlice the sea bass finely into strips about 1cm in thickness, then put them in with the radishes and onions.\nSqueeze the limes and blood oranges – you need about 250ml – then season with the sherry vinegar, and a little salt and black pepper. Pour the juice over the fish and vegetables, cover and set aside, in the fridge, for about two hours. Serve on chilled plates.\nCotechino with potatoes and lemon \nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cotechino with potatoes and lemon. Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin for the Observer \nThe marriage of pork and lemon has long been a favourite of mine. This time, potatoes are roasted with lemon, olive and bay then tossed with pieces of juicy Italian sausage. Cotechino, the plump, sticky, boiling sausage, can be found in Italian grocers. It comes in a sachet, which you slip into cold water and bring to the boil. Beware the hot juices when you slip the hot sausage from its foil.\nServes 3\nsmall, waxy potatoes 750g\nlemon juice of 1\ngarlic 4 cloves\nolive oil 4 tbsp\nthyme 10 small sprigs\nrosemary 4 sprigs\nbay leaves 3\ncotechino sausage 500g\nSet the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Wash the potatoes, then cut them in half lengthways and put them in a roasting tin. Squeeze in the lemon juice then add the empty lemon shells. Add the peeled garlic cloves, olive oil, thyme and rosemary, and a little salt and black pepper, then toss gently to coat the potatoes. Place in the preheated oven and roast for about 30 minutes till the potatoes are golden.\n\nPut the cotechino, still in its sachet, into a deep pan of cold water and bring to the boil. Lower the heat to a simmer, cover with a lid and follow the timing instructions on the packet. (The cooking time will probably be about 20 minutes.)\nRemove the cotechino from the water, open the pouch, carefully remove the sausage then cut into six thick slices. Tuck the slices among the potatoes and return to the oven for 10 minutes before serving.\nFig and orange shortbreads \nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fig and orange shortbreads.

Place a piece of baking parchment on a baking sheet.\nRemove and discard the hard stems from the figs, then put the figs into a food processor, add the golden sultanas and process to a coarse paste. Set aside.\nPut the butter, cut into small pieces, into the bowl of a food mixer, add the icing sugar and beat, with a flat paddle beater, to a pale, soft cream. Pour in the vanilla extract, and blend in the ground almonds and flour. Roughly chop the pistachios and fold them in, together with the orange zest.\nLightly flour a chopping board. Take a tablespoon of the fig paste and roll it into a ball. Scoop up two tablespoons of the almond shortbread dough, roil it into a ball then press a deep hollow in the centre. Place the ball of fig paste in the hollow and draw the almond shortbread around it to completely enclose it. Flatten the balls lightly with a fork, then place on the lined baking sheet, with a little space between them.\nBake for 20-25 minutes until pale biscuit coloured, then remove from the oven and allow to cool. Sift icing sugar over the biscuits and, if you wish, scatter with dried rose petals.\nSeville orange curd \nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Seville orange curd. Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin for the Observer \nSharper than the usual lemon curd, with a delicious bittersweet marmalade tang.\n\nEnough to fill a standard jam jar\nlemons 2\nSeville oranges 2\nbutter 100g\ncaster sugar 200g\neggs 3\negg yolk 1\nGrate the zest from the lemons and oranges, using a fine-toothed grater over a heatproof glass or china bowl. Slice the fruits in half and squeeze the juice. You need a total of 240ml.\nPlace the bowl of juice and zest over a saucepan of simmering water. Cube the butter and add it, together with the sugar, whisking regularly. When the butter has melted, break the eggs into a small mixing bowl, add the egg yolk and beat lightly to mix. Stir the eggs into the fruit and butter mixture and continue whisking, often but not continuously, until you have a thick, custard-like consistency.\nRemove the curd from the heat and leave to cool.
