Bukaty/Associated Press\nMaine Governor Paul LePage.\nBy Marina Villeneuve Associated Press February 24, 2017\nPORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Maine’s Republican governor has asked U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions to ramp up prosecution of drug crimes.\nGov. Paul LePage tells the former U.S. senator that slow federal prosecution is straining Maine’s resources, according to a copy of the letter dated Jan. 26 obtained by The Associated Press.\nAdvertisement\nLePage says the state is forced to prosecute and imprison offenders who break ‘‘the most serious’’ federal laws.\nThe governor said Maine is being overrun by drug gangs from other Northeastern states, and they’re ‘‘decimating’’ residents in his state. LePage successfully pushed for more state drug enforcement agents and has repeatedly spoken out against heroin traffickers coming into the state.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Of the 2016 cases, 42 cases involved heroin and Oxycontin, up from 20 in 2011.\nSpokesman Donald Clark said the office works with the Maine Attorney General’s Office and county prosecutors to determine whether drug cases are appropriate for prosecution in federal or state court.\nHe said the U.S. Attorney’s Office ‘‘is, and has been, firmly committed to working with our state and local partners to combat the opioid problem in Maine on all fronts.’’\nMaine Attorney General Janet Mills, a Democrat, said the state has ‘‘excellent cooperation’’ with the U.S. Attorney’s Office, which she said has ‘‘obtained substantial sentences against major drug traffickers.’’\nShe supplied data showing the state prosecuted 332 heroin cases last year, up from 61 in 2011. Heroin represented 37 percent of drug cases prosecuted last year, up from 6 percent in 2011.\nLePage also wrote to previous Attorney General Loretta Lynch last year asking for more federal prosecutors to tackle the drug crisis and acknowledged the Maine U.S. Attorney’s Office was pressed for resources.\nA message was left with Sessions’ office on Friday.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show that Sessions was a senator, not a congressman.", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2017%2F02%2F24%2Fmaine-lepage-asks-sessions-boost-drug-prosecution%2FTeYoAaEJadeeuKUzVoX7zH%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&t=Maine’s", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2017%2F02%2F24%2Fmaine-lepage-asks-sessions-boost-drug-prosecution%2FTeYoAaEJadeeuKUzVoX7zH%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&title=Maine’s", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Maine’s", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2017%2F02%2F24%2Fmaine-lepage-asks-sessions-boost-drug-prosecution%2FTeYoAaEJadeeuKUzVoX7zH%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%3Fevent%3Devent25&tMaine’s", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2017%2F02%2F24%2Fmaine-lepage-asks-sessions-boost-drug-prosecution%2FTeYoAaEJadeeuKUzVoX7zH%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%26s_campaign%3dsm_gp%26hl=en-US"], "published": "2017-02-24T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T08:05:36.485+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
