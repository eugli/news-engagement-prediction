Mr. Trump, who mentioned how important the next justice was to Republican voters, according to exit poll data, said he wanted someone who was “not weak,” an adviser said. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump also said he wanted to avoid what he called the mistaken appointments of other Republican presidents — namely Justice David H. Souter, who drifted left, and Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who voted to uphold the Affordable Care Act. By early January, officials on Mr. Trump’s transition team had whittled the campaign’s lists down to seven finalists. They were invited to Washington and faced two sets of probing interviews. Aides had read everything the finalists had written. In Judge Gorsuch’s case, that meant a trip to New York to obtain copies of student newspapers he had contributed to as a student at Columbia.

Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times On Jan. 5, Judge Gorsuch met with Mr. McGahn in a conference room at Jones Day, Mr. McGahn’s law firm. The meeting was for “personal vetting,” to make sure there was nothing embarrassing in Judge Gorsuch’s background. Later that day, Judge Gorsuch was driven to the Trump campaign’s transition office. In a basement room, under florescent lights and with bags of cookies and candy bars in the corner, Judge Gorsuch was grilled by five members of the Trump team: Vice President-elect Mike Pence; Reince Priebus, now the White House chief of staff; Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief strategist; Mark Paoletta, now Mr. Pence’s counsel; and Mr. McGahn. With a six-page memo on Judge Gorsuch’s writing prepared by Mr. McGahn in front of them, the five men asked him about his writings and the role of a judge. “We’ve never talked to him about abortion,” a White House official said. “There was no discussion about specific cases or outcomes.” Mr. Pence, the official said, was particularly engaged in the selection process. The six other finalists all went through a similar two-step interview in Washington. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Four, like Judge Gorsuch, served on federal appeals courts: Judges Thomas M. Hardiman, William H. Pryor Jr., Diane S. Sykes and Raymond M. Kethledge. The others were Judge Amul R. Thapar, of a Federal District Court in Kentucky, and Justice Don R. Willett of the Texas Supreme Court. With the exception of Justice Willett, all had already undergone F.B.I. background checks and Senate confirmations. “People loved Tom Hardiman,” an official said. “He was super personable. Pryor has done more for the cause than anyone else in the country. But the politics are really tough.” Judge Pryor had taken strong stands against gay rights and abortion, calling Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion, “the worst abomination of constitutional law in our history.” Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.
