We are making sure that fellow students have the support they need both immediately and in the days ahead.” \nA Justgiving page set up to raise money for the boy while he was fighting for his life in hospital has almost reached £2,000. \nA parents’ evening planned for Thursday has been postponed but pupils at the school were still advised to attend during the day as normal. \nPrincipal Rebecca Handley Kirk said: \"We are devastated by these events, and we send our thoughts and our love to Michael's family and friends. \n\"Michael had only joined us in September, but was already becoming a well-known student throughout the school, thanks to his lively personality. Michael enjoyed football, making jokes and being with his friends.
