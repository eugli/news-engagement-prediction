I don’t know why the city is being as aggressive as they are now.” \nThe 2.2-million-square-foot, seven-building complex on Clay is authorized by the city to be a factory, but has morphed over the years into a space for a variety of businesses and a locale for edgy events and movies. It has nearly 150 tenants. \nThe century-old center has acted as a de facto home for woodworkers, glass artists, musicians and various members of Detroit’s creative community. Its website says in 2008 it was \"one of the largest artistic communities in the Midwest.\" \nDavid Bell, the city's director of buildings and safety engineering, sent out a statement outlining the various problems inspectors found. \n\"They have erected walls using combustible materials, illegally installed plumbing and heating systems in numerous units without the proper permits, inspections, and approvals,\" he said. \"During a recent inspection, the smell of natural gas from the multiple illegal installations was so strong, DTE had to be immediately called to correct the leak.\" \nThe Russell Industrial Center was the backdrop for a daylong music festival on Aug. 15, 2015.

Fire officials have yet to announce the cause of the blaze. \nYoung said it is unfair to draw parallels between the Russell complex and the Ghost Ship. \n“This building is made of concrete,” Young said. “We’re not building staircases out of wood pallets and building walls out of bad materials.” \nMany tenants have considered leaky roofs, broken freight elevators and leftover asbestos from its days as the Murray Auto Body Corp. as part of the cost of having an affordable studio space in a transforming city with rising rents. \nDuring a walk-through on Tuesday, some tenants held out hope for a swift resolution between Dennis Kefallinos, the center's owner, and the city. \nOthers, such as 25-year-old musician John Bochnowski, boxed up belongings and planned to seek out new studio space. For the past year, he has taught music lessons at the RIC, as the complex is known. \n“When the city makes decisions like this, the burden and the punishment falls directly on the artists here,” Bochnowski said. “Who is going to see the value of a facility like this in the community?” \nNovack said the center aims to address any safety problems, but is mostly baffled by the city's abrupt order considering that the center has been open to artists for more than a decade, and has hosted many high-profile events, including having a role in the movie \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.\" \nEarlier this month, it hosted the Dirty Show: the 18th annual International Erotic Art Exhibition. It also has been the backdrop for a variety of events, including parties, concerts and even a boxing match. \nThe Russell Industrial Center was designed in 1915 by architect Albert Kahn, and took a decade to build. It initially was a factory for auto parts and bodies, and during World War II it made airplane wings. \nIn 2003, the complex was purchased by the Clay Street Group, and sought to draw artists. Five years later, the center's website said, it had more than 140 tenants. \nThe center's website says that it welcomes \"small businesses and manufacturers ranging from the food industry, to furniture, to the arts and fashion, and beyond.\" \nBut Bell said multiple commercial and residential tenant spaces were built without proper permits, inspections and other approvals. \nHe added that the center is being used improperly for a variety of things, including living spaces; studios for artists; photographers and musicians; a counseling center, and a fitness center. \nNovack, however, denied that the center rented out living spaces — or that its tenants had made the property their home. \n\"Due to the blatant disregard for city ordinances, laws, and regulations this owner has shown, this facility will be vacated until it has all proper permits inspections and approvals,\" Bell added. \"We plan on sitting down with the owner later on this week to discuss this facility coming into compliance.\" \nAllison Key, 33, has operated her glassblowing studio and business out of the center for nearly a decade. Known as Urban Pheasant Glass, the collective currently hosts nine artists who pay $1,000 a month for about 1,400 square feet of space. \nFollowing the city’s notice, she’s reluctantly seeking out new space but said finding anything as affordable in Detroit will be a challenge. \n“I wouldn’t be where I am today without a space at the Russell,” Key said. “It was a space we could afford, make our own and be safe in.” \nKey has hosted a yearly Michigan Glass Project charity event at the center for the past four years. In 2016, the three-day event raised $80,000 for Art Road, a local nonprofit focused on funding arts education for students throughout metro Detroit. \nKey said she is unsure where her event will be hosted this year if the Russell shuts down. \n\"As artists, we teamed up together in this space to sustain our livelihoods in the city,” Key said. “It’s an important space for a lot of people.” \nNerf wars at the Russell Industrial Center have ended because of the closures. \nConnor McGaffey, 29, of Ferndale, who operates the Detroit Dart Club in Building 2, said he didn’t receive a notice to vacate. But while he feels comfortable the 4,700-square-foot area he rents is safe, he’s moving the operation. \n“I don’t think it’s responsible to say, with the gas leaks, ‘Yeah, bring your kids here,’” he said. “For me, (it’s) the reputation of the Russell — I just have to find a new spot.” \nMcGaffey said he hasn’t had any safety issues in the space, which is on the ground level and has three exits. His clients are frequently kids with birthday parties or corporate workers — such as from Quicken or General Motors — who come to play games shooting each other with foam darts. \nWith kids off school this week, he said he’s losing money. \n“This is one of the busiest weeks,” McGaffey said. “Whenever the kids have days off school, it’s a big week for me.” \nHe said he gets 45-50 groups per month, and he had 86 reservations in the next couple of months that he’s planning to reschedule. \n“This could be a good thing for me, as far as, ‘All right, let’s check out some other spaces and do this bigger and better,” McGaffey said, adding that he’s looking for other industrial-style places in Detroit. \nStaff writer Ann Zaniewski contributed to this report.
