(Photo: Jasen Vinlove, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nDAYTONA BEACH, Fla. — This was what Kurt Busch craved, Tony Gibson deserved and Tony Stewart pursued for so long. \nBut it wasn’t what NASCAR needed, not on this day. It’s simply Busch’s misfortune that his win Sunday in the Daytona 500 will be parsed for anything other than being his greatest moment in a race car, Gibson’s as a crew chief or Stewart’s as an owner after failing to win NASCAR’s premier showcase in 17 tries as a driver. \nBut it’s true. \nThis Speedweeks had already been all about crossroads, improving ratings, finding a footing as an industry even before stakeholders locked figurative arms to show solidarity after a Wall Street Journal article that many felt besmirched the sport. Monster Energy’s entry as title sponsor was highly scrutinized, and a new points system was unveiled to stoke ratings and rejuvenate the sport’s prospects. \nMORE DAYTONA 500: NASCAR makes changes to ramp up racing, boost TV ratings \nA glorious Sunday began strangely on a red carpet lined with dancing Monster Energy girls leading competitors to the drivers meeting where series Chairman Brian France admonished drivers not to block each other. \nThen after 14 cars representing seven past Daytona 500 wins were eradicated in a series of sublime wrecks, Busch’s victory turned into a resolution that will leave many unfulfilled. And that has nothing to do with his often tempestuous past. It has everything to do with NASCAR dodging the potential calamity of an absurd race when it needed a showpiece. — FOX SPORTS: NASCAR (@NASCARONFOX) February 26, 2017 \nTwenty-one-year-old pole-sitter Chase Elliott, son of Hall of Famer and two-time Daytona 500 winner Bill Elliott, led for 23 laps entering the final three circuits around the 2.5-mile racetrack. A win might have enticed desperately needed younger fans to patronize NASCAR. Or it might have done nothing. \nIt might have helped Atlanta Motor Speedway officials put more patrons into their generally highly available stands next weekend to cheer for a homegrown Georgia son. Maybe not. \nBut those enticing prospects sputtered away with the last wisps of fuel in Elliott’s No. 24 Chevrolet with two laps left. \nThen Kyle Larson, 24, another driver on whom NASCAR has pinned a great deal of its hopes and prayers, took the lead but ran out of fuel with one lap left. \nThis strange day in which the comeback of Dale Earnhardt Jr. had been snuffed in a wreck, Corey LaJoie nearly plowed through Clint Bowyer when he appeared to lose brakes and otherwise professional race car drivers kept running into each other, might have been saved. \nBut it wasn’t. \nBusch, Gibson and Stewart won it, and that’s all that matters. They should celebrate it. \nPHOTOS: Best of the 2017 Daytona 500 Facebook A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
