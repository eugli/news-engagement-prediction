I would like to congratulate the team,\" he said. \nMore than 100 entries were submitted for the awards, which recognise the work done using the interactive storytelling tool Shorthand in 2016. \nThe top prize for standout story went to Mercy Corps, for 'Driven by love' , about the charity's work with refugees. \nWales Online, was given a special mention in the same category for their \"moving\" story marking the 50th anniversary of the Aberfan disaster. \nBlack Gold by the NZ Herald, telling the story of the trade of hair extensions, was awarded the prize in the most visually compelling category. \nWhile The Mountains Moved by Stuff.co.nz received the award for best use of interactivity.
