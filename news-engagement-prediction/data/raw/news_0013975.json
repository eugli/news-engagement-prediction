(Photo: Chris Pizzello, Invision/AP) \nBEVERLY HILLS, Calif. — La La Land director Damien Chazelle waltzed off Saturday night with the top honor at the Directors Guild of America Awards. \nIt's the latest stop on the ebullient musical's journey to the Oscars, but it wasn't all song and dance at the annual awards ceremony. The evening also took on a more somber, urgent note as many directors and presenters also grappled with President Trump's refugee and immigration ban. \n\"I wanted to celebrate the act of dreaming and what art means. Art does connect people and transcend borders,\" Chazelle said. \"I want to be part of that transnational dialogue of movies.\" \nFirst-time nominee Chazelle, 32, is the youngest-ever recipient of the DGA feature film award, which all but guarantees an Oscar win on Feb. 26. \nRarely has the DGA winner not gone on to win the directing prize at the Academy Awards. La La Land recently won the top honor at the Producers Guild Awards and is nominated for a record-tying 14 Oscars. Who'll win? Analyzing pros and cons of the Oscar best picture nominees \nEarlier in the evening, La La Land stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling presented Chazelle with the directing medallion. While singing his accolades, like the fact that he shot the musical in 40 days using 35mm film, 93 locations and 1,600 extras, Gosling also joked that Chazelle \"directed his own birth in a single take.\" \nChazelle was up against Barry Jenkins for Moonlight, Kenneth Lonergan for Manchester by the Sea, Garth Davis for Lion and Denis Villeneuve for Arrival. All but Davis are also nominated for the Oscar. \nDavis did win the first-time director award for Lion. Starring Dev Patel and newcomer Sunny Pawar, Lion tells the true story of an Indian man who was lost at age 5 and 25 years later used Google Earth to retrace his steps to his hometown and his birth mother, not knowing the name of either. \nNicole Kidman (from left), Sunny Pawar and Garth Davis attend the 69th annual Directors Guild of America Awards on Feb. 4, 2017.

Ezra Edelman won the documentary award for O.J.: Made in America which he called a \"labor of labor.\" \nOther winners included Steven Zaillian for The Night Of, Tina Mabry for An American Girl Story — Melody 1963: Love Has to Win, Miguel Sapochnik for Game of Thrones and Becky Martin for Veep. \nSir Ridley Scott was also given the 35th Directors Guild Lifetime Achievement Award, presented by Christopher Nolan, Billy Crudup and Michael Fassbender. \nFassbender described Scott as, \"direct, generous, loyal, competitive ... and a bit of a loner who prefers the company of dogs to most people.\" \nBeyond the self-congratulatory air typical of a Hollywood awards season event, many were compelled to address the refugee and immigration ban as it relates to the entertainment industry and the art it creates. \nDavis said he's spoken to \"a lot of refugees who have said that this film has given them the courage to find their families.\" These 10 women have directed movies we can't wait to see \nChazelle praised Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi, an Oscar-nominee for his film The Salesman, who won't attend this year's Academy Awards because of a travel ban imposed by Trump. \nFarhadi \"comes from a country my government tells me I shouldn't be in dialogue with,\" Chazelle said, adding that the business of excluding filmmakers or voices is \"inherently anti-art.\" \nAlejandro Inarritu, the Mexican director who won last year for The Revenant, called the current political story \"a bad remake of one of the worst stories of the last century.\" \n\"The only way we win is by telling good, complex and truthful human stories,\" Inarritu said. \"No alternative facts or false statistics will defeat that.\" \nSo prevalent were politics throughout the evening that even the absence of a political statement required acknowledgement. \n\"I'm not going to talk about politics because there have been a lot of references to politics tonight and I'm best off not talking about it,\" Scott said.
