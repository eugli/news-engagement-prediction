That’s exactly what they’ve got here,” he said. \nLib Dem Lord Tyler called it the “best day care centre for the elderly in London”. \n“Families can drop off him or her and make sure that the staff will look after them very well, nice meals subsidised by the tax-payer, and they can have a snooze in the afternoon in the chamber or in the library,” he said. \nBut not all peers were so scathing about the House of Lords. Labour’s Baroness King said the Lords were there “to do the serious work, without just being inundated with the political point scoring”. \n“I look at what the Lords does and what the Commons does, and the comparative legislative chaos that is being sent from the Commons to the Lords, and I genuinely think, thank God the Lords are there,” she said. \nTory peer Lord Dobbs said the House of Lords took “all of the nonsense, rubbish, legislation” from the House of Commons and worked on it “a bit like a composting machine”. \n“Whatever comes out the other end is always more fragrant and more fertile than what went in,” he said. \nMeanwhile John Bird, a crossparty peer, explained he had started his career working in the House of Lords’ kitchens, but was asked to leave after two weeks for “trying to destroy capitalism”. \n“There was an important woman who would say to me, if you don’t like it here you can always bugger off to Russia. And I’d say yeah but they’d shoot me before they’d shoot anybody else. And then she said I don’t care, dead or alive I don’t want you in the kitchen,” he told the programme.
