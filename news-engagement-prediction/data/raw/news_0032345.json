Church wedding on a hot day in February \nThe Taylors were married in the Church of England in Hillston on February 10, 1947 — a day they remember as \"110 in the shade\". \nThe following morning, they caught the early train to Griffith where they dressed up again in their wedding clothes for a formal studio portrait. \nThey spent their honeymoon in Sydney, spending one night at the People's Palace at Pitt Street and then three weeks at a Bondi boarding house run by two elderly women. \n\"They were twins and they were funny as anything,\" Mrs Taylor said. \nThey remember getting lost in the city and spending Friday nights at the Tivoli Theatre. \nBack home on the farm, the young couple began domestic life in a ramshackle old house. \n\"It was built out of soft and hard timber, and white ants had eaten all the soft timber out, so it'd half collapsed,\" Mr Taylor said. \n\"We spent nearly every night until 12 o'clock or more working on the house inside.\" \nThey also built a huge workshop together; Mr Taylor was a talented bush mechanic, who in 1956 won the 6,500 miles (10,460 kilometres) Ampol Round Australia Trial with his mate Wilf Murrell. Tragedy brought couple closer together \nMr and Mrs Taylor's first daughter Wendy was born the same year they married, followed by Susan, then Dennis. \nBut in March 1952 tragedy struck when 15-month-old Susan accidentally ate ant poison. \nThey rushed her to hospital, but after hours of trying to save her, she died. \nMrs Taylor became ill from grief and took years to recover, including periods spent in mental health institutions. \n\"I was [in a] very dark place for a long time,\" she said. \nBut far from destroying their marriage, the terrible loss of their daughter brought the couple even closer together. \nMr Taylor travelled with his wife to Sydney and Canberra seeking treatment for her depression. \n\"I couldn't see her suffer,\" Mr Taylor said. \n\"It was a terrible shock to both of us — I just happened to be, I suppose, a little bit stronger.\" A special, lasting bond \nIn 1983, the Taylors sold their farm and retired to Canberra. \nThey celebrated their 70th anniversary in January with a large family gathering but have planned a quiet day together on the actual date.

(ABC Radio Canberra: Louise Maher) \nDespite some arguments over the years — \"I call him a silly old bugger ... quite a lot!\" — Mrs Taylor said she relished the special bond she had with her husband. \n\"He'll be going to say something to me and I'm thinking it and going to say it to him,\" she said. \n\"Sometimes he says it first and sometimes I say it. \n\"He's just a wonderful person — I love him to death.\" \nMr Taylor said he had married \"the most beautiful girl in Hillston\". \n\"We've always been there for one another right through our 70 years,\" he said. \n\"We just got along well ... and hope to for a good while, until the day comes.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T05:56:35.604+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
