Whatsapp is available in 10 Indian languages, making it easier for merchants to use the app. “We will continue to grow the languages. There are more than 10 languages here,” Acton said. \nFirst Published: Saturday, February 25, 2017 - 12:00 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T15:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T10:30:32.810+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
