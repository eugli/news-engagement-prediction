Question: What Is the Difference Between an Ionic and Covalent Chemical Bond? \nAnswer: A molecule or compound is made when two or more atoms form a chemical bond , linking them together. The two types of bonds are ionic bonds and covalent bonds. \nIn an ionic bond, the atoms are bound together by the attraction between oppositely-charged ions. The atoms have different electronegativity values from each other. For example, sodium and chloride form an ionic bond , to make NaCl, or table salt . \nIn a covalent bond, the atoms are bound by shared electrons. In a true covalent bond, the electronegativity values are the same, although in practice the electronegativity values just need to be close. If the electron is shared equally between the atoms forming a covalent bond , then the bond is said to be nonpolar. Usually, an electron is more attracted to one atom than to another, forming a polar covalent bond. For example, the atoms in water, H 2 O, are held together by polar covalent bonds. \ncontinue reading below our video Ionic and Covalent Chemical Bonds \nDo you understand?
