Grant Hackett’s brother Craig speak to the media yesterday. Photo: David Clark   \n“He had the world at his feet … such a role model to so many kids … and now no one knows what’s going to happen. It doesn’t look encouraging. \n“It’s coming to the point now where he is dangerous. He’s a danger to himself, he’s a danger to the community, and poor Mum and Dad have tried to look after him so much. I’m concerned for their welfare.” A handcuffed Hackett gives a thumbs up to the media after his arrest.

Grant Hackett leaves Southport Watchhouse yesterday following his arrest.

This is a completely different person. I don’t know this person, my mum and dad don’t know this person. \n“He’s there in body, but he’s not there in mind, soul or spirit. \n“We can’t do it. It’s getting to the point where he’s dangerous. He’s a danger to himself and to the community.” \nHackett, a three-time Olympic gold medallist and considered to be one of Australia’s greatest swimmers, has struggled with personal issues and addiction. \nHe attempted to make the team for Rio last year but missed out, only to be involved in a drunken incident on the flight back from Adelaide and was detained by police. \nIn 2014, he was filmed walking around The Crown Casino in his underwear claiming to be looking for his young son. That lead to a five-week stint in rehab. \nHackett has made little secret that he had struggled to adjust after professional sport and this latest incident comes as a huge setback in his efforts to reform his life. \nHe spent time in a US rehab clinic where he was treated for a sleeping pill addiction after photos emerged of him wandering around looking lost with a singlet wrapped around his waist as a pair of shorts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T05:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:18:45.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
