(Wally Skalij / Los Angeles Times) Dylan Hernandez \nIn the coming days, Chase Utley will report to the Dodgers spring training facility in Arizona to take the physical examination required to finalize his new one-year contract. \nFrom the outside looking in, this looks like a minor deal. Utley is 38, and Logan Forsythe will be the team’s primary second baseman. \nThat won’t be the view on the inside. \nBy retaining the highly respected veteran, the front office has made a loud and clear statement to the players: What they think counts; how they feel matters. \nAdd the Utley deal to everything else the Dodgers did this winter — trading for Forsythe, re-signing Kenley Jansen , Justin Turner and Rich Hill — and the guess here is that players will open spring training this week with a greater trust of the team’s decision makers. \nThis is no small development, considering everything that has transpired over the last couple of years, when well-liked players were traded and key contributors weren’t re-signed. \nFrom the time Andrew Friedman became the team’s president of baseball operations, many players viewed the front office with a degree of skepticism. Privately, they wondered whether the club’s analytically inclined executives were more invested in stocking the farm system than winning now, and they questioned the sincerity of declarations made about the importance of clubhouse culture.
