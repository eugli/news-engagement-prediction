He beat out stiff competition from Bruno Mars, Bon Iver and his fellow Canadians The Weeknd and the late Leonard Cohen. \nA Tribe Called Quest also won the major honor of Best International Group for their return to the scene in 2016. They beat out popular acts such as Kings of Leon and Twenty One Pilots. \nIt was a disappointing night, however, for the UK‚Äôs biggest grime stars. Skepta and Stormzy had been both been nominated for British Breakthrough Act, but lost out to singer-songwriter Rag‚Äôn‚ÄôBone Man. \nStormzy can still say that he had a good night, utterly killing a duet with Ed Sheeran on the singer‚Äôs ‚ÄúShape Of You.‚Äù \nThe same can‚Äôt be said for Drake‚Äôs buddy and collaborator Skepta, whose performance of ‚ÄúShutdown‚Äù was heavily censored, making for a disjointed audio experience for viewers at home. \nNaturally, those watching took the Brits to task over their decision to mute much of Skepta‚Äôs biggest hit. Brits ‚Äì Let's invite Skepta \n‚Äî Lawrence James (@DJLawrenceJames) February 22, 2017 Our favourite lyric of Skepta's ‚Äì\"Shut Down\" is \"Audio Muted\". Speaks to us on a spiritual level. #BRITs2017 #brits pic.twitter.com/fVV518syEC \n‚Äî We Are Generation Z (@GenerationZMag) February 22, 2017 Dermort literally said \"shit\" and Skepta can't say \"pussy\" smh. #brits \n‚Äî GRM Daily (@GRMDAILY) February 22, 2017 My reaction to Skepta being bleeped out #BRITs2017 pic.twitter.com/bmZ64JE6Xu \n‚Äî Shazid Miah (@shazidmiah) February 22, 2017 #brits No point having Skepta on if you're gonna mute out half the song!!!! Ruined it for me! \n‚Äî Ibrahim Banks üëë (@TheShowOff85) February 23, 2017 Why bother getting Skepta to perform when you're just going to mute the whole thing. Wankers \nThe offending lyric that most people wanted to hear was ‚ÄúRing, ring, pussy ‚Äî it‚Äôs shutdown,‚Äù a lyric that refers to Skepta‚Äôs track ‚ÄúIt Ain‚Äôt Safe.‚Äù \nWell, that‚Äôs what a real shut down sounds like. \nHere‚Äôs the track in its full glory.
