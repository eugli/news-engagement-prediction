Equally displayed for sale is Super J. noodle, a noodle brand produced by Super J. Limited, a company based in Bangkok, the capital city of Thailand. \nSimilarly, further checks at the Sango-Otta branch of the mall revealed that the same Barilla Spaghetti was on display for sale at the mall. \nAt Sahad Stores, one of the largest in Abuja, similar Italian Barilla Spaghetti brands were also on sale despite the ban. \nHowever, in all the stores visited, other banned items like fruit juice in retail packs were absent. \nJohn Ifeanyi, a customer at the Ikeja Shoprite mall, attributed the development to Nigerian’s love for imported product, noting that it is the bane of Small and Medium Enterprises, SMEs, in the country. \n“Nigerians love imported products and these malls have identified that…and that’s why they are keying into it,” he told PREMIUM TIMES. \n“It is the reason why our local industries and start-ups always struggle to survive,” he added. \nAzeez Akorede, a Sango-based entrepreneur, said the porous nature of Nigerian borders was the cause of the development. While imploring the government to look into the situation, he decried the harsh business environment Nigerian entrepreneurs and business owners are being made to operate in, noting that no country develops with such system. \n“Nigerian entrepreneurs and manufacturers are faced with numerous challenges; yet they have to still compete with their foreign counterparts on Nigerian soil. Government needs to do something drastic to protect Nigerian business owners and manufacturers,” he said. \n“No nation develops by exposing its manufacturers to risks and undue competition from foreign businesses.” \nOfficials at the malls visited declined comment. Imported Spaghetti at Nigerian malls \nAt the Sango-Otta Shoprite mall, the attendants including a man they identified as ‘their oga’, declined to speak. Same at the IKeja mall in Lagos and Sahad Stores in Abuja where officials all declined comment. \nAn e-mail sent to the officially listed address on Shoprite’s website was also unattended while phone calls to its customer service was unanswered. \nA phone call to Sahad Store’s customer service listed on its website was answered by an official who identified himself as Auwal. He, however, said he was unaware of the spaghetti ban and that he would communicate to the management who would address the issue promptly. \nEfforts to reach the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria, MAN, proved abortive as the phone number of its Public Relations Officer, Victoria Anioke, was not reachable. For more than a week, she did not reply messages sent to her either. \nBut when PREMIUM TIMES contacted the Nigerian Customs Service, NCS, Joseph Attah, the acting Public Relations Officer, disclosed that the agency is doing its best to control the activities of smugglers and their collaborators. Mr. Attah, an Assistant Comptroller of Customs, noted that all hands must be on deck to ensure that anti-smuggling operations of the Nigerian Customs are successful, noting that the general public has a role to play too. \n“Anti-smuggling operation is like fishing; you cannot catch them all. That’s why we often tell the general public to supply us with information so we could track them (smugglers) down,” the Customs spokesperson told PREMIUM TIMES. \nCommenting on PREMIUM TIMES findings, Mr. Attah disclosed that importation of Spaghetti in commercial quantity still remains banned, adding that investors should desist from channelling their funds into such business. \nHe, however, urged the Nigerian media to intensify efforts in sensitizing the people on the economic benefits of patronizing Nigerian-made Spaghetti, noting that apart from being more nutritious, it contributes to the nation’s economic growth.
