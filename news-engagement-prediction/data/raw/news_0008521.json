It's not going to change my opinion.\" \nBarkley even suggested that he and LeBron should go at each other with paintball guns as an event at the All-Star weekend, which quite frankly, sounds ridiculous and stupid. \nSeveral players have come to the support of James in this feud, including Camelo Anthony and Dwyane Wade, but really, this spat needs to stop before it escalates further and out of control. Hopefully, the two can talk to one another soon to put this drama to bed and concentrate on the basketball instead. \nHowever, because LeBron has always been someone that Barkley has criticized, you just know for a fact that the next time he makes a mistake, the TNT analyst is just going to be all over it - especially after the way he spoke above - bringing up this whole dispute again and state how much of a distraction it was.
