CTVNews.ca Staff Published Thursday, February 23, 2017 8:09AM EST Last Updated Thursday, February 23, 2017 10:13AM EST \nA police officer’s opinion on a motorist’s level of drug-induced impairment should be accepted as expert evidence at trial, the Supreme Court of Canada has ruled. \nThis is a breaking news alert. An earlier version of the story is below… \nThe Supreme Court of Canada is set to rule Thursday on whether a police officer’s opinion on a motorist’s level of drug-induced impairment should be accepted as expert evidence at trial. \nOfficers can administer field sobriety tests for suspected drug impairment, but unlike alcohol, there’s currently no roadside test such as a breathalyzer. \nThere is also no legal blood-concentration driving limit for marijuana or other drugs. Therefore, in drug-impairment cases, the courts must rely on specially trained police officers known as drug recognition experts, who are sometimes referred to as evaluators. \nThe legal ruling will determine whether drug recognition experts should be required to submit voir dires to the presiding judge so they can be permitted to testify at drug-impairment trials. \nThe government argued the submission would add unnecessary delays. The opposing view is that personal opinions should not be a legal avenue for determining guilt. \nCTV legal analyst Edward Prutschi said that the ruling will be a “big deal either way.” \n“The issue is, what are these drug recognition officers? Are they police officers like anyone else? People consider police officers to be experts if you’re a lay person, but in court, they’re not. They’re just like anyone else. They give testimony about their general experience.” \nPrutschi said if the court rules that the officers are experts, their opinion provided in court cases carries extra weight: If you’re qualified though as an expert, you’re now permitted to give opinion evidence. No one else can do that in courts.” \nThe case at the heart of the ruling involves Carson Bingley, of Ottawa. In 2009, Ottawa police charged him with driving while impaired after he struck a car. \nAn officer on scene said he showed signs of intoxication, however, an alcohol screening test found his blood-alcohol concentration well below the legal limit. \nBingley did fail, however, a standard field sobriety test administered by a DRE at the scene. “When he failed the sobriety tests, Mr. Bingley was charged with driving while drug impaired,” a case summary notes. \nBingley eventually admitted to taking two Xanax smoking marijuana in the previous 12 hours before he was stopped. The police drug recognition expert decided Bingley’s ability to drive was impaired by marijuana use. A urine test revealed the presence of cannabis, cocaine and Alprazolam. \nHowever, in an Ontario court, Bingley was acquitted. A summary conviction appeal led to the acquittal being overturned and a new trial was ordered. \nThere a second judge found the DRE evidence could be received without a voir dire. However, on the voir dire, the judge determined that the DRE evidence was inadmissible, and Bingley was again acquitted. \nAfter a second summary conviction appeal brought on by the Crown, a third trial was ordered. Bingley was unsuccessful in his subsequent appeal.
