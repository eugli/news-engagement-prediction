Storm Doris to batter Britain with 80mph winds and heavy rain Read more \nSome Labour MPs said they were increasingly concerned about the effects of Storm Doris on turnout in Copeland and Stoke and those that had visited the seat said the Tory campaigns in both seats were growing in confidence. \n“Turnout is going to be the problem for us. I think people on a cold day in February will think ‘Oh, why should I bother?’” one Labour MP said. “The Tories were only a handful of votes behind Ukip and I think they could even win in Stoke. If you’re an anti-Labour voter, and they are the majority in Stoke, you could decide to vote Tory. It could happen with a low turnout.” \nOn the doorstep in Copeland, where Labour has a slim 2,564 majority, there was little enthusiasm to turn out and vote even among loyal Labour voters, the MP said.

Given his past record on nuclear power and on Trident, just down the road, it makes it too much for people to believe. \n“There is a general sense of disillusionment, and the most frequent response is ‘I don’t know who to vote for’ and then it means people are far more likely to stay at home.” \nHowever, another Labour source said a low turnout did not necessarily mean there would be a Conservative victory in Cumbria.

It is genuinely impressive and disciplined considering the geography. The messaging is simply, we are committed to nuclear power and focused on saving the maternity services.” \nAnother Labour backbencher said they believed the party’s relentless focus on the NHS would see them clinch Copeland. “I am getting the sense that the NHS has really punched through, as indeed it should. Campaign issues-wise, this is almost the perfect by-election for us.” \nThe exact timing and course of Storm Doris remains uncertain, the Met Office said, but it is forecasting gale-force winds late on Thursday morning. The warning added: “There is potential for a short-lived core of very strong winds to develop. While some disruption is expected outside of this stronger swath of winds, the amber area looks most likely to see more significant disruption.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:41:50.918+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
