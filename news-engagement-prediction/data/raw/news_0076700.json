You mean underwear? \n\nNo, we’re not talking about underwear – we’re talking about footwear! \nYou may have considered that thongs were referring to the skimpy pieces of underwear and swimwear won by women relaxing on the beach (much like a G-string). But in Australia, thong has an entirely different meaning. \nThongs are simply one of Australia’s finest contributions to all of society. If you were to walk among the streets of Australia proclaiming your lack of knowledge on the subject, you would quickly be set on the right path. \nThongs, to put it simply, are the staple piece of footwear that every Australian citizen has within their wardrobes. \nAussie thongs primarily consist of a sole and thong passing between the first and second toes of the feet and affixed in a Y formation on three points to the sole. They are typically padded with spongy textures and are incredibly comfortable to wear. \nAlthough thongs in Australia are, well, not as sexy as the thongs in America – they mean so much more here! \ncontinue reading below our video Tipping Etiquette Around the World \n\nWhy do we Love Thongs? \nThey're your basic sandals, your basic go-to on a hot summer day when all you want to do is go for a brisk walk or if you want to head down to the beach. \nYou can get your basic garden-variety thong made of plastic, through to a bejeweled, sparkling, upmarket thong that wouldn’t look out of place with a nice long evening frock. \nWhether you’re relaxing on a beach in Queensland , shopping up a storm in Melbourne or enjoying a late brunch in Sydney , thongs may just be your ideal footwear choice. \nThongs are occasionally referred to as jandals in New Zealand, or slippers or go-aheads in other parts of the world. In America, you may have known them as flip-flops. \n\nHow Much Does a Good Pair of Thongs Cost? \nWhen paying for a decent pair of thongs, you won’t need to spend much. \nAt the extreme end of the scale, you could fork out as much as $80 for a pair of designer-brand, high quality thongs. \nOr if you’re travelling on a budget , you could spend as little as $1 for a basic supermarket pair, depending on what you’re after. \nShould you want a decent pair that is both comfortable and durable you shouldn’t be too hard to find, and paying around AU$10-$20 is fairly standard. \nShould you want to elevate your status a little bit more, you can always hand over a little extra money for designer thongs such as havianas. If ever in the midst of a thong emergency, you can also run to a thong vending machine . With thongs coming out of vending machines, it is clear to see that this product is so much more than a mere pair of footwear – it’s part of the Australian psyche! \n\nWhen Not to Wear Thongs Whilst we all love our thongs here in Australia, we are not always able to wear them in all circumstances. \nFor instance, should you be attending a formal occasion, it is typically unacceptable to wear thongs. In some clubs and venues, you may be refused entry for trying to sneak your thongs in after 6pm at night. When you are engaging in sports , they may also become slippery and unsafe. \nAlso, should the weather be incredibly wet and rainy, thongs are probably not the best choice of footwear as some pairs may soak up water. Should you be driving, it is recommended that you take these shoes off, as they may get slippery and get caught between the pedals. \nSo, if you're imagining a bronzed Aussie beach girl in what Americans call a thong, you are definitely looking in the wrong direction. You have to look down at her feet to see if she's wearing thongs.
