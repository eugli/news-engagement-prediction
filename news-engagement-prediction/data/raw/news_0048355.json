Jillian O'Neill's team, Kaimai Valley Crossfit, placed 4th in the Masters division.

Metcon Madness / Facebook \nNearly 500 competitors from around the country descended on Auckland for New Zealand's largest outdoor CrossFit competition. \n\"It's really empowering as a woman, to be strong, and although in the middle of a workout you're thinking, 'what the F am I doing? This is killing me,' at the end of it the adrenalin buzz kicks in and you can't wait to do it again. \n\"But it's just that fact of being fit, knowing you can keep up with your kids, knowing you can lift your heavy suitcase and do all that stuff yourself, that's kind of what CrossFit was designed for, to have people fit for life. \n\"And there's a real community spirit around CrossFit, you become mates. None of us knew each other before this - or maybe just to say hello to because we're a small town. \" \nRobert Wade, 46, has come up from Kawerau in the Bay of Plenty to compete with his team K.Fit. \nHe's been doing CrossFit for three years, after trying out a free class at a Mt Maunganui CrossFit gym on a mate's recommendation. \nHe says his strength is probably in the more gymnastic elements. \n\"I'm not as strong as some of these big tanks here,\" he jokes. \n\"I'm slowly getting there but I do notice my healing time is a little bit longer than some of these younger guys - you don't heal as fast as the young fellas.\" \nWade says as they train hard and \"try to eat as clean as we can all the time\", the only special training the team do in the lead-up to a competition is to focus on the workouts as they are released. \n\"So handstand walking, sled-pulling and that sort of stuff, but nothing too far out of the normal training we do.\" \n\"We like rolling with the younger guys though as it keeps us competitive, it's a healthy sort of competition between us.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T09:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T05:13:20.203+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
