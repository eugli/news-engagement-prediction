The second victim died from his injuries hours later. \nKyle Sparks-McKinnon, 26, of Toronto, was arrested Feb. 11, 2016 and later charged with two counts of second-degree murder and three counts of attempted murder in connection with the shooting. \nVIDEO: Arrest made in Chinatown double homicide (Feb. 12, 2016) \nPolice released CCTV images of several persons of interest from the time of the shooting that they later said directly led to the arrest. \nOn Tuesday, police announced they had arrested a second suspect, 33-year-old Jahmal Richardson of Oakville, Ont. He has also been charged with two counts of second-degree murder and three counts of attempted murder and is scheduled to appear in a Toronto court on March 2. \nBoth Sparks-McKinnon and Richardson are half-brothers and were also charged in the Halloween 2015 shooting of Charles Shillingford in downtown Toronto. \nREAD MORE: Police charge Toronto, Halifax men with first-degree murder in Halloween shooting \nPolice said Shillingford was shot in the chest in the area of Yonge Street and Charles Street just after 2 a.m. on Oct. 31, before crashing his vehicle into a building near Yonge and College Street. He was taken to hospital where he was later pronounced dead. \nHomicide detectives said in May 2016 they had executed several search warrants and arrest warrants in relation to the shooting of Shillingford. \nRichardson and Sparks-McKinnon as well as Mitchell Mannette, 20, of Halifax and Denzell Tyresse Walter Desmond, 19, of Halifax were then arrested and charged with first-degree murder in connection with that shooting and appeared in court on May 19, 2016. \nVIDEO: ‘Project Sizzle’ raids targeted gang originating in Nova Scotia \nA month later, police announced they “eradicated” a violent downtown street gang called Heart of a King following a Canada-wide investigation that led to the arrests of 53 people on 285 charges. \nPolice said the multi-jurisdictional police operation, nicknamed Project Sizzle, began in January 2016 and culminated in predawn raids at multiple locations in the Greater Toronto Area in June 2016 — totalling 43 search warrants. \nIn addition to the arrests of the suspects, four of whom were apprehended in Montreal, several items were also seized including 11 vehicles, 17 firearms, an undisclosed amount of drugs, body armour, jewelry and $45,000 in cash. \nREAD MORE: Project Sizzle leads to 53 arrests, 285 charges after ‘Heart of a King’ gang targeted \nInvestigators say the Heart of a King gang, also known as H.O.K., began operating in 2010 and originated from a well known gang from Nova Scotia called North Preston’s Finest. \nToronto Police Insp. Bryan Bott said in June that Richardson, who used the aliases Bam or Bambino, was the alleged leader of the gang, which centred its criminal activity on adult entertainment establishments and local bars in downtown Toronto. Bott said Sparks-McKinnon was also a member of the gang. \nAnyone with information is asked to contact police at 416-808-7400 or Crime Stoppers anonymously at 416-222-TIPS (8477). \nWith files from David Shum Homicide victims ID'd by Toronto Police~David Eminess, 26~Quinn Taylor, 29 Watch press conf: https://t.co/UhXikBQ2eJ pic.twitter.com/OPV7VX5dib \n— Homicide Squad (@TPSHomicide) February 2, 2016 © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
