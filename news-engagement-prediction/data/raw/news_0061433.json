New mother Stephanie is also on a poster showing her at an exercise class with her baby \n“She is 67 and she started boot camp when she was 60,” Sport England chief executive Jennie Price told Telegraph Sport . \n“She was walking her dog in the park and decided she would like to try it. And, seven years later, there she still is. \n“That’s a great message, too, because we don’t see many positive, everyday, role models for women as they get particularly into their 60s.” \nN ew mother Stephanie is also on a poster showing her at an exercise class with her baby, who is described as ‘Cuter than a dumbbell but just as heavy’. \n“There’s a really strong feature this time around about pregnancy, birth, how women feel working out when they have recently given birth and when they have got really young children,” Price added. \n“I know it’s talked about a lot in the context of motherhood, how you lose your sense of self, but very rarely in the context of something like exercise, which lots of people regard as a bit selfish and a bit on the edge and not really as relevant but is incredibly important to lots of people.” \nA nd back for her second starring role is Grace, who took a break from sport following the first advert and is trying to show that there is no shame in having done so. \n“Sport remains a very in and out thing,” Price said. “You are either in it or you’re completely out. And, therefore, the normal kind of life pattern of stuff getting in the way sometimes – missing a week or missing a month or six weeks – makes it quite hard. \n“And if you’re already thinking, ‘People are judging me’, when you go back, there is a bit of a sense that sport’s there with its arms folded saying, ‘Where have you been then? This is the stuff that you’re meant to do every week’.” \nT he final group targeted are those who feedback from the first campaign indicated felt it focused too heavily on mainstream activities like running, cycling, swimming and keep fit. \nPrice said: “For the younger girls, they said, ‘This is all very well, and we know we should be doing this, but can’t you give us something a bit more exciting? Can’t you give us something a bit more out there?’ \n“So, that’s why we’re featuring roller derby, and you see a lot of roller derby in the ad, because the pace of it and the excitement of it is really strong.” \nT he new advert is set to a soundtrack blended with the 1978 poem, ‘Phenomenal Woman’ by Maya Angelou, and – like its predecessor – the television version of it will make its debut during Coronation Street on Friday night. \nWhether it goes viral to the same degree or wins a comparable number of awards remains to be seen, but, for Price, all that matters is that it once again helps get more women active. \nThe two years since the first advert has seen the gap in participation between men and women fall from 1.75m to 1.3m and Price said: “The task is to close that gender gap further, to normalise women exercising still, at all ages, at all levels of ability, and to really help the sector think not just how it represents women but the experiences that it gives them.” Follow Telegraph Sport", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T19:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T14:17:00.155+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
