Picture: Chris Higgins Matthew Dunn news.com.au @mattydunn11 \nFINALLY there is a way to find out when the NBN will be available in your area. \nAs part of an update the company’s website address tracker , people will be able to see a time frame for when their local area will be connected to the National Broadband Network (NBN). \nThis feature is a first for the company, with the previous address tracker only telling people when NBN construction would begin in their area — not a specific time frame for when the service would actually be available. \nThose down for a connection in 2017 will be given a three-month window, while people on the list for 2018 or beyond will be given a window of six months. This is what customers will see on the website. Source: Supplied \nIn addition to an actual time frame, the online tool will show what technology will be used in the roll out, plus a list of telcos that will offer the service. \nUnfortunately, information on internet speeds and bandwidth are not included - something that has been a talking point of recent times, with a number of current NBN customers left frustrated by the fact it’s impossible to get the “superfast” speeds they are paying for . \nThe NBN is hoping every household in Australia will have access to the network by 2020. \nAbout eight per cent of Australian homes are expected to have a satellite or fixed wireless connection, while the remaining 40 per cent will be split between new fibre connections and hybrid fibre coaxil using the existing pay TV cable network. \nHow have you been finding the NBN?
