ANDY JACKSON/Fairfax NZ \nShona Salisbury from St Aubyn Veterinary Clinic spends some time with stow away kitten, Maui. \nShell New Zealand chairman Rob Jager said it was likely she'd climbed into a shipping container while it was being loaded, and wasn't discovered until she was at the platform roughly 50 kilometres off the coast. \nREAD MORE: \n\"It's unusual to have a small animal or bird found offshore but it has happened before,\" he said. ANDY JACKSON/Fairfax NZ \nMaui came in a bit dirty and shy but is pretty much back up to full health. \n\"Now one of the guys from the Maui team is taking her home. He looked after her when she was offshore and has convinced his wife they should keep her. \n\"Unless someone claims her.\" \nAnimals aren't allowed on the platform and fortunately Maui didn't cause any damage during her short stay. STOS \nRebekah Smith, platform medic, at Maui B with Maui the kitten. \nWorkers managed to lure her into a cage borrowed from a local vet with a rasher of bacon, then loaded her onto a specially-requested helicopter. Ad Feedback \nShe's now staying at St Aubyn Vet Clinic in New Plymouth until her new family takes her home. \nVet Gemma Kinross said she got a call from one of her clients asking to borrow a cage to take to the Maui B platform. Stuff \nMaui the kitten's journey from New Plymouth to the Maui B gasfield roughly 49 kilometres off the coast. \n\"It was all a bit confusing, I just thought they meant the port,\" she said. \n\"But then they said it needed to be pretty fast because there was a helicopter waiting.\" \nAside from coming in a bit shy, dirty and slightly traumatised from her helicopter ride, Maui was healthy even after a few nights at the platform. \n\"We have no idea what her start in life was like, we checked for a microchip straight away,\" Kinross said. \n\"It seems like everyone loved her, someone rang today saying they would have her as soon as she could leave.\" \nKinross suspected Maui was seeking food when she got into the container and it looked like she had stowed away to the right place, coming back with a full belly from the crew's attentions. \nMaui isn't the first cat to stowaway on and oil and gas ship. In 2001 a cat called Colin's stowed away on the methanol tanker Tomiwaka from New Plymouth to South Korea. \nColin's belonged to one of the tanker terminal workers at Port Taranaki, but after falling asleep on board the Tomiwaka she set sail for international waters. \nOn her arrival back home by air New Plymouth's mayor Peter Tennent named her an honourary ambassador of the district. Sadly she passed away in 2007. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T10:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T06:02:46.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
