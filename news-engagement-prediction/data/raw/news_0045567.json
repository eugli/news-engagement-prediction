As a result of the withdrawal of the UAE, which was supposed to host the tournament, the ACC has decided to shift the venue to Bangladesh. \nAccording to Bangladesh Cricket Board CEO Nizamuddin Chowdhury , Hong Kong and the UAE decided not to participate this time citing their busy schedule. “There won’t be eight teams this time in the Emerging Asia Cup. As per the ACC schedule, Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates will be busy due to their respective schedules. That’s why we will be hosting six teams,” he told local media. \nSimilarly, the ACC has also decided to postpone the tournament by 10 days. The event has now been scheduled for March 25-April 5. Earlier, the first match was scheduled for March 15. \nHe said the BCB plans to host the tournament in Fatullah, BKSP and Cox’s Bazar, and the final may take place in Mirpur. \nThe Emerging Teams Cup is an under-23 tournament. Test-playing Asian teams (India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh) will be allowed to field four national players each, while associate teams can field their respective national squads. \nMeanwhile, in the ICC World Cricket League, Nepal are to play Kenya in Kathmandu on March 13 and 15. The team then head to Hong Kong, and play their final match of the league, seen as a gateway to the World Cup Qualifiers, against the UAE at home.
