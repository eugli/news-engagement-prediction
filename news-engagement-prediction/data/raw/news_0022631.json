NEW GENERAL MANAGER? \nFoley himself first hinted at a change when Lana expressed her desire to help him improve Raw in the ratings battle with SmackDown Live, claiming that his job will be up for grabs soon.

I think it’s going pretty well, so well that I’m just like, I don’t see the firing that I thought was imminent when I took [the job].

Like, it’s not a long-tenured position, especially if they put an emphasis on you. It’s two things. Really, the big thing is hoping it pays off for somebody. \n“When my time is up, I hope Stephanie gets a heck of a promo out of it and it helps somebody.” \nIt seems like a new favourite has emerged to take over his job, and per The Inquisitr , that man could be Kurt Angle. ON-SCREEN ROLE \nAngle will be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame this year, which gives you a slight indication that the company doesn’t intend on using him in an in-ring role. \nThis comes after a Cageside Seats report last month , claiming WWE are wanting to use Angle in an on-screen role once he’s been inducted, and there's no bigger job available once Foley is out of the equation. \nHe already has the experience of being a general manager, as he oversaw the SmackDown brand in 2004, and he’d certainly bring more interest to the red brand as he’s a fan favourite, much like Daniel Bryan. \nSo, the seeds have been planted for Foley’s departure, now we must wait and see whether WWE can secure Angle as Raw’s general manager. \nWould you like to see Kurt Angle replace Mick Foley as Raw’s general manager?
