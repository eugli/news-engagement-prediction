But they haven’t exactly changed much. View photos New ‘The Last Jedi’ toy boxes – Credit: Disney More As you can see, Rey is wielding that very special lightsaber once more – the one she was given by Maz Kanata in ‘The Force Awakens’ which used to belong to none other than Luke Skywalker himself. Clearly she’s been brushing up on her lightsaber skills since ‘Star Wars: The Force Awakens’ and she looks far more confident with that blade. And then there’s her new hairstyle. What about the others? Well, it looks as though Finn is still rocking Poe Dameron’s jacket from ‘The Force Awakens’… and he really hasn’t changed much since we last saw him. As for Poe, he’s kitted out in his full X-Wing pilot’s flight suit. And it looks like he means business. “The first Star Wars Force Friday event was truly unique, uniting fans across five continents in an unprecedented global live unboxing event ahead of thousands of midnight openings at retail,” said head of Disney Consumer Products, Jimmy Pitaro. “Plans for this year’s world-wide event are top secret but expect something befitting the excitement around the next episode of the Star Wars saga.” What does this tell us about ‘The Last Jedi’? Well… not an awful lot. These static images don’t exactly reveal anything major about our three new heroes in the run up to the first ‘The Last Jedi’ trailer. In fact, it’s all pretty run of the mill. Of course, that’s not to say there won’t be some big, explosive reveals by the time we get our first real glimpse of the movie. But for now, it’s just a cool glimpse of our returning heroes. ‘Star Wars: The Last Jedi’ stars Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Oscar Isaac alongside Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver, Gwendoline Christie and Andy Serkis. Rian Johnson wrote and directed the movie. ‘Star Wars: The Last Jedi’ heads to cinemas on 15 December 2017.
