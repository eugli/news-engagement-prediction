They lie to us.” \nWord of his belief started to spread, causing a stir on social media. Irving was asked about his comments on Friday in New Orleans at the NBA All-Star Weekend. Kyrie Irving was trending on Twitter today because he believes the Earth is flat. I asked him about it. pic.twitter.com/ODe9aP9qmK \n— Arash Markazi (@ArashMarkazi) February 18, 2017 \n“I think people should do their own research, man,” Irving told ESPN reporter Arash Markazi. “Hopefully they’ll either back my belief or they’ll throw it in the water. But I think it’s interesting for people to find out on their own.” \nIrving was then asked if he had seen any pictures of a round planet but he remains a skeptic. \n“I’ve seen a lot of things that my educational system has said that was real that turned out to be completely fake. I don’t mind going against the grain in terms of my thoughts.” \nPerhaps the oddest part of the story might be that Irving isn’t the only NBA player who believes the earth is flat. \nGolden State Warriors forward Draymond Green avoided offering a commitment on the flat vs. round argument while Denver Nuggets forward Wilson Chandler chimed in on Twitter with his ‘flat’ vote.
