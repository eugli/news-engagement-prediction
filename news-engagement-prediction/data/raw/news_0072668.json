Jason Bateman voices the role of a conniving fox. \nThe social commentary of \"Zootopia\" arrived in theatres as the United States grappled with issues of racism, sexism and inequality during the 2016 presidential campaign. \nThe filmmakers started developing \"Zootopia\" about five years ago with \"this crazy idea of talking about humanity with talking animals, in hopes when the film came out it would make the world just a slightly better place,\" co-director Byron Howard said as he accepted the award. Co-director Rich Moore said he was grateful to audiences around the world \"that embraced this story of tolerance being more powerful than fear of the other.\"\nThe Oscar win for \"Zootopia\" extends a renaissance for Disney Animation Studios, which took home the animation trophy in 2014 for \"Frozen\" and in 2015 for \"Big Hero Six.\"\"Zootopia\" was co-directed by Byron Howard and Rich Moore. \n\"Zootopia\" competed against another Disney Animation film, the musical \"Moana\" about a young Pacific island heroine. \nOther nominees were stop-motion film \"Kubo and the Two Strings,\" Swiss drama \"My Life as a Zucchini,\" and \"The Red Turtle,\" a film with no dialogue, from Japan's Studio Ghibli.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T18:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T11:26:32.122+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
