Key Points: Mr Trump signed executive orders on border security, including his planned Mexico border wall Mexico's foreign relations department said \"negative statements\" did not occur The two have had a series of public spats over Mr Trump's determination to have Mexico pay for the planned wall \nThe excerpt of the call, obtained by The Associated Press, did not detail who exactly Mr Trump considered \"bad hombres\", nor did it make clear the tone and context of the remark, made in a Friday morning phone call between the leaders. \nIt also did not contain Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto's response. \n\"You have a bunch of bad hombres down there,\" Mr Trump told Mr Pena Nieto, according to the excerpt. \n\"You aren't doing enough to stop them. I think your military is scared. Our military isn't, so I just might send them down to take care of it.\" \nA person with access to the official transcript of the phone call provided only that portion of the conversation to The Associated Press. \nThe person gave it on condition of anonymity because the administration did not make the details of the call public. \nStill, the excerpt offered a rare and striking look at how the new President is conducting diplomacy behind closed doors. \nThe Mexican foreign relations department said: \"The negative statements you refer to did not occur during said telephone call. On the contrary, the tone was constructive.\" \nThe phone call between the leaders was intended to patch things up between Mr Trump and his ally. \nA White House spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. \nThe two have had a series of public spats over Mr Trump's determination to have Mexico pay for the planned border wall, something Mexico steadfastly refused to agree to. \nThe Mexican website Aristegui Noticias published a similar account of the phone call, which described Mr Trump as humiliating Mr Pena Nieto in a confrontational conversation. \nMexico's foreign relations department denied that account, saying it \"is based on absolute falsehoods\". Mexico - US relations under Trump administration \nMr Trump has used the phrase \"bad hombres\" before. \nIn an October presidential debate , he vowed to get rid the US of \"drug lords\" and \"bad people\". \n\" We have some bad hombres here and we're going to get them out,\" he said. \nMr Trump's comment was in line with the new administration's stance on foreign policy matters in general, and the president's willingness to break long-standing norms around the globe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T13:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T08:19:05.237+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
