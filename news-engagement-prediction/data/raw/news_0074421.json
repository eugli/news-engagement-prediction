Seemingly, the G6 has what it takes to be a successful device that has the potential to shake the status quo. It has a speedy chipset that hints at excellent performance, an exorbitantly high screen-to-size body ratio, water-tight full metal bod', and last but not least - the same dual-camera setup that has made the previous high-end LG devices an appealing choice. But is the hardware feature list of the G6 enough to take on the already-existing superstars, the Galaxy S7 edge and the Google Pixel XL?

It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is. 565 ppi 534 ppi Technology Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.
