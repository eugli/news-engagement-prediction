The compound forms two enantiomers (compounds which are mirror images of each other), dextromethamphetamine and levomethamphetamine. \nMethamphetamine hydrochloride salt is a white crystal or crystalline powder at room temperature that is bitter-tasting and odorless, with a melting point between 170 to 175 °C (338 to 347 °F). It readily dissolves in water and ethanol. \nThe free base of methamphetamine is a clear liquid that smells like geranium leaves. It dissolves in ethanol or diethyl ether and mixes with chloroform. \nAlthough crystal meth is a persistent pollutant in soils, it is degraded by bleach or within 30 days in wastewater that is exposed to light. Where Does Crystal Meth Come From? \nMethamphetamine is available with a prescription for obesity, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and narcolepsy, but crystal meth is a street drug, made in illegal labs by chemically altering over-the-counter drugs. Making crystal meth usually involves reducing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine, found in cold and allergy medicine. In the US, a typical meth lab employs something called the 'Red, White, and Blue Process', which entails hydrogenation of the hydroxyl group on the ephedrine or pseudoephedrine molecule. The red is red phosphorus, white is the ephedrine or pseudoephedrine, and blue is iodine, used to make hydroiodic acid. Making crystal meth is dangerous to the people making it and dangerous to the neighborhood where it's being made. White phosphorus with sodium hydroxide can produce poisonous phosphine gas, usually as a result of overheating red phosphorus, plus white phosphorus can auto ignite and blow up the meth lab. In addition to phosphine and phosphorus, various hazardous vapors may be associated with a meth lab, such as chloroform, ether, acetone, ammonia, hydrochloric acid , methylamine, iodine, hydroiodic acid, lithium or sodium, mercury, and hydrogen gas .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:41:40.676+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
