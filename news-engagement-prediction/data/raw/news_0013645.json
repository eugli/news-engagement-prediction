As the buyers have drifted off, the sellers have also started to back away and the number of home listings is down 25 per cent from a year ago, according to CoreLogic RP Data. \nThis is all yet to show up in a decline in prices in Australia. In the nation's eight biggest cities, home prices surged a further 0.7 per cent in January even as the volume of transactions was lower. But some real estate experts and hedge fund investors say that it may be only a matter of time before prices also start to crumble.

The property sector is also a major employer and generator of demand, a particularly important pillar of the economy during a subdued period for the mining sector. \nOne big concern is the drop off in the number of Chinese buyers , following a crackdown by Beijing on capital outflows and Australia's tightened restrictions on lending to foreigners.

That sober behaviour is in contrast to the buying frenzies of the past three years that saw hopeful bidders queuing up to take part.
