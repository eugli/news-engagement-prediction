The timeless story of Chandrakanta, the princess of the fictitious kingdom of Vijaygarh, is being reimagined once more, this time by Life OK . TV actor Kritika Kamra, who plays the titular character, shared the first promo of the show on her social media handles on Wednesday. A video posted by Kritika Kamra (@kkamra) on Feb 8, 2017 at 6:57am PST \nKamra looks stunning in the 40-second video, making us want to wait till March 4, when the show premieres at 8pm. This is the second time that Devaki Nandan Khatri’s famous novel, Chandrakanta – Prem aur Paheli, is being adapted for Indian television. The first outing by Doordarshan, called Kahani Chandrakanta Ki, was a rage in the ‘90s. Actor Shikha Swaroop essayed the eponymous character then. A video posted by Kritika Kamra (@kkamra) on Feb 8, 2017 at 7:03pm PST \nA fantastical romance, Chandrakanta traces the story of two star-crossed lovers. Helmed by Nikhil Sinha, it might be the next big historical drama on Indian TV. Going by the promo, the makers seem to have captured the mood and the essence of that time and age just right. Splendid costumes, grand sets, decent VFX and Kritika Kamra are more than enough to capture the attention of viewers.
