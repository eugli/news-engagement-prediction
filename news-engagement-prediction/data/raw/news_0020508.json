Wile blowing off some steam in the Virgin Islands, Obama went kitesurfing with Richard Branson and the pure joy on his face is infectious. \nWith the weight of the presidency off his back, it looks like Obama was finally able to relax a little. According to The Huffington Post, Obama enjoys surfing, but while president wasn't able to participate during his eight years of service due to necessary Secret Service protections. \nThe owner of Virgin, Branson invited the Obamas to the Virgin Islands . Branson wrote on his website that after a surfing session at the beginning of his presidency, a security personnel told Obama that it would be his last time he could surf for eight years. However, the former president who grew up in Hawaii is now able to have some additional freedom and get some of his normal life back. \nBranson also wrote on his website about a competition between himself and Obama . He said they made a bet to see who could master a new skill first: Obama with kitesurfing and Branson with a foilboard. It was a close race, but in the end, Obama pulled out a victory. \nPhotos of the kitesurfing event have emerged, and they show an Obama who looks carefree and downright excited to be flying through the air.
