Sharma’s colleague, inspector Badrish Dutt, a member of the team that arrested Mohammed Rafiq Shah from Jammu and Kashmir was shot dead by his girlfriend in 2013. The then DCP Ajay Kumar retired last year. \nKumar’s boss, Karnal Singh, the then joint commissioner who supervised the case, left Delhi police around 6 years ago and has not returned since. Singh was recently appointed as the director of the enforcement directorate. The then police commissioner KK Paul, who retired in 2007, is currently the governor of Uttarakhand. \nDCP Sanjeev Yadav brushed aside reports of having framed the men. \n“Two men, Farooq Ahmed Batloo and Ghulam Ahmed Khan, were arrested for their role in funding the blasts. The men plead guilty and were convicted. Tariq was also been convicted. The main conspirator Abu Ozefa was killed in Srinagar by a joint team of Delhi police, J&K police and the Army. We will read the judgment after the two men who were acquitted and might approach the a higher court,” Yadav said. \nManisha Sethi, Jamia Milia Islamia’s associate professor and member of Jamia Teachers Solidarity Association that published two books about alleged frame-up of youths by the special cell in the case said, “Until there is prosecution of policemen and agencies who frame innocents and till courts take a pro-active role in providing compensation, we can’t see acquittals after periods of incarceration as justice…” \nThe second book of Jamia Teachers Solidarity Association’s (JTSA) documents eight special cell cases, in which 16 men were arrested on terror charges, only to be acquitted later.
