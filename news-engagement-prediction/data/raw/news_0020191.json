WATCH: Hlaudi Motsoeneng eyeing leadership position in government \n\"The DA also welcomes the fact that Motsoeneng and his toxic influence will now be removed from the SABC until such time as he has either faced a satisfactory disciplinary hearing, or the findings of and remedial action [stipulated] by the public protector have been reviewed and set aside by another court,\" the party's federal chairman, James Selfe, said. \nHe said it was time the SABC ended its \"frivolous litigation\" at the expense of the taxpayer and focused on fixing the public broadcaster and correcting the damage Motsoeneng had caused. \nThe SABC's lawyer, Stephan du Toit, argued in the Cape Town High Court last week that its earlier ruling had set a bad precedent in that it allowed outsiders \"to interfere in the employment policies of organs of the state\". \nHe said the matter should be clarified by the Supreme Court of Appeal. \nMotsoeneng's appointment \"constituted an internal arrangement\" and was not an exercise of public power, Du Toit contended. Hunt for 'fit, proper' SABC \nThe SABC said it was \"disappointed\" by the court's ruling. \n\"Our lawyers will get a copy of the judgment today and go through it. Once they have gone through it, they will advise us on how to go forward,\" SABC spokesman Kaizer Kganyago said. \nUnder Motsoeneng, the SABC has lurched from one crisis to another. \nThe parliamentary committee investigating the SABC finalised its draft report last month and sent copies to affected parties, including Communications Minister Faith Muthambi.
