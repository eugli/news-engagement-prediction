But the personalities and temperament we have, we have a tight-knit group.” \nOther businesses like Cesar’s Tacos, normally open 24 hours a day, remained closed for all of Thursday. \nCowan said she does not hold it against her employees and hopes the movement can evolve. \n“I get it. I took a day off to go to Washington to march for what I thought was my right and my daughter’s right and this is their turn,” said Cowan. \nBusiness owners like Cowan said they did not bring in any temporary workers and everyone who protested is welcome back to their job on Friday. \n  Jeff Paul facebook Follow Reporter Jeff Paul joined the CBS 11 News team in 2014.
