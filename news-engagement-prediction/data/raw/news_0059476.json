Mr Turnbull had condemned the UN over its “one-sided” criticism of the Jewish state. \n“Australia has been courageously willing to puncture UN hypocrisy more than once, including this absurd resolution that said the Western wall — the most sacred site for the Jewish people for thousands of years ... even before the rise of Islam — that this is occupied Palestinian territory,” Mr Netanyahu told press today in Sydney. media_camera Mr Netanyahu praised Australia’s strong rebuke of the United Nations. Picture: Jason Reed/Getty Images \n“The UN is capable of many absurdities and I think it’s important that you have straightforward and clear countries like Australia that often bring it back to Earth.” \nMr Netanyahu and Mr Turnbull both reaffirmed Australian and Israel’s long friendship in a joint press conference in Sydney today. \nThe two leaders signalled a stronger association in the future in both their commitment to innovation and in combating the rise of radical forces in the Middle East. \n“We discussed how we can intensify our co-operation against this radical terrorism that reaches deep into every corner of the world, including to Australia, but I believe that we have not only the force of technology, but of conviction to defeat these forces,” Mr Netanyahu said. media_camera Mr Netanyahu (L) is the first Israeli Prime Minister to visit Australia. Picture: Toby Zerna \n“I see a change in the Middle East, in many Arab countries, that recognise that they, too, are being threatened by these malignant forces, and that gives me hope that in co-operating with them for our common security, we might also be able to advance the peace between us and them, and ultimately between us and our Palestinian neighbours,” he said. \n“And [in] all these efforts we see you, Australia, as our partner.” \nEarlier, Mr Turnbull had lauded Israel’s business, science and innovation credentials and praised the “miraculous country” for succeeding as the sole liberal democracy in a region racked by war. \nThe Prime Minister also reiterated Australia’s support for a two-state solution. \nThe Turnbull government would not back deplorable campaigns to delegitimise the Jewish state and would “not support one-side resolutions criticising Israel of the kind recently adopted by the UN security council”, he wrote in an opinion piece for The Australian. \nHe condemned the ongoing bias, citing 20 UN resolutions between 2014 and 2015 which were critical of Israel compared to just one issued in response to the Syrian civil war, which has claimed more than 250,000 lives and “driven millions from their homes”. media_camera Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull wrote a scratching piece about the UN’s treatment of Israel. Picture: AAP/Dean Lewins \nPrime Minister Netanyahu’s visit comes after Australia was outspoken in its opposition to the recent security council resolution condemning continued Israeli settlement building in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. \nThe Obama administration and New Zealand had backed the UN’s call. \n“We recognise that Israel and the Palestinians need to come to a settlement and we support a directly negotiated two-state solution so that Palestinians will have their own state and the people of Israel can be secure within agreed borders,” Mr Turnbull said in The Australian . \n“We believe that with so many other larger, more destructive and intractable disputes in the Middle East, this is a time when Israeli and Palestinian leaders, supported by the global community, should return to the negotiating table and work towards a solution that upholds the rights of both peoples to live side-by-side in peace and security.” media_camera Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrives in Sydney — and even the pilots are recording the historic moment. Picture: AAP Image/David Moir \nPrime Minister Netanyahu also responded strongly to the comments of former Prime Ministers Bob Hawke and Kevin Rudd, who called for Australia to recognise Palestine and condemn Israeli expansion in the West Bank. \n“I prefer not to deal with labels but with substance and I ask both former prime ministers to ask a simple question: What kind of state will it be that they are advocating,” he said. \n“A state that calls for Israel’s destruction? \n“A state whose territory will be used immediately for radical Islam? \n“Israel retreated already from Gaza, took out all the settlements there, gave the territory to the Palestinian Authority and this became a terrorist state of Hamas, backed by Iran. \n“They fired thousands and thousands of missiles against us. \n“So clearly when people say they are for a Palestinian state, they are not for that kind of state. “What kind of state will they be talking about?” \nMr Netanyahu said it was not conceivable for people to say the Palestinians should have a state and while they continued to call for the annihilation of the Jewish state, Israel. \nHe said the Palestinians should govern themselves but not have the military might to threaten Israel. media_camera Former Prime Minister Bob Hawke has condemned the state over its decision to approve a law retroactively legalising 4000 settler homes. Picture: Lachie Millard \nFormer Prime Minister Bob Hawke, a long-time supporter of Israel, had last week joined those condemning the state over its decision to approve a law retroactively legalising 4000 settler homes. \nIn an opinion piece for Fairfax Media, Mr Hawke wrote of the aspirations of those who had fought for peace in the Middle East were being “trashed by the inexorable expansion of Jewish settlement in the West Bank”. \n“Australia was there at the very beginning,” he wrote. \n“The least we can do now, in these most challenging of times, is to do what 137 other nations have already done — grant diplomatic recognition to the State of Palestine.” \nSeveral senior Labor frontbenchers this week insisted a two-state solution would not be viable if settlements were continued to be encouraged and allowed by Israel. \nAbout 50 people gathered outside the Israeli embassy in Canberra on Monday to protest against the visit, with similar rallies expected in Melbourne and Sydney this week amid tight security. \nRoad closures and traffic diversions are in place across parts of Sydney for the visit. \nMore than 60 prominent Australians, including former Labor politicians, senior legal professionals and clergy, have signed a statement opposing Mr Netanyahu’s visit because of his government’s policies towards Palestinians.
