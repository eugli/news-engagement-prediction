The only bit of evidence the police have ever had is Corrie's phone pinged at Barton Mills within a minute and a half of the bin lorry getting there. \n\"If they knew that was the route that Corrie's phone had taken, it's a logical step to think that there's a possibility Corrie has also stayed with his phone.\" \nSuffolk Police have previously defended their decision not to search the site while other lines of enquiry were being pursued and added no new waste has been deposited there since Corrie's disappearance. \nDetectives added they hadn't searched the site because they couldn't rule out another vehicle had taken the route or that his mobile phone was with Corrie at the time it was giving out the signals.
