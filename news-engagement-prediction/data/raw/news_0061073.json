Kevin Coffey \nThey were asked to weigh a sentence between 2 and 20 years for each of the charges Coffey was convicted for. They had the option of recommending community supervision instead of time in jail. \nJurors deliberated less than an hour before deciding that Kevin Coffey should be sentenced to 20 years in prison for each charge. \nEllis County District Judge Cindy Ermatinger decided to stack the sentences, meaning one sentence will begin after the other. \n\"Take care of yourself and good luck to you, sir,\" the judge told Coffey. \n\"Thanks, your honor,\" he responded, before court was dismissed. \nIn the back of the courtroom sat the 16-year-old who testified through tears last week about Coffey's sexual advances when she was 14. She said they would Skype for hours at night and would meet up in his office, where she said he once stuck his fingers into her genitals. \nProsecutors were seeking the maximum time in prison for Coffey, who they said wore two masks: as Maypearl's top cop and as a predator who preyed on vulnerable teenagers. \n“This is a man that isn’t going to get better by probation so the only thing you can do is put him in prison for as long as you can,” Assistant District Attorney Grace Pandithurai told jurors in her closing arguments “His actions get the sentence he deserves.” \nCoffey’s attorney, James Jenkins, asked for grace on Coffey’s behalf in his closing remarks. \n“Mr. Coffey does not deserve grace. Nobody does,\" Jenkins said. \"Grace is not mercy, it’s not forgetting. It’s giving something that’s perhaps undeserved.\" \nLast week, an investigator testified that Coffey collected “provocative” photos of young girls he met through his job as a police officer in Maypearl. At one point, the former U.S. Marine was working as a school resource officer in the city. Maypearl police chief collected 'provocative' photos of teens he met through work, investigator testifies \nTexas Rangers investigator Adam Sweaney returned to the witness stand during the punishment phase of Coffey’s trial on Tuesday to describe things found on Coffey’s computer which the jury hadn't heard about during the trial: Coffey visited an erotica website and searched for stories about incest, among other topics. \nSweaney testified that law enforcement officials in Ellis County don’t appear to be supportive of Coffey. \nHe said the case “hurts the next guy up or the other guy around that tries to deal with people” in Maypearl. Maypearl's former police chief is convicted of molesting 14-year-old girl in his office \nThe city’s mayor and a local businessman also took the witness stand on Tuesday to talk about Coffey’s work as a policeman. They said he was helpful and created new programs -- like a Shop with a Cop program that allowed cops to take underprivileged families shopping for Christmas. \nBut Mayor Adele Mooney and Larry Burns, who owns the only bank in town, acknowledged that Coffey tarnished the town’s reputation and betrayed its people. \n“Fair to say Mr. Coffey wore his two faces really well?” Assistant District Attorney Ricky Sipes asked Burns during testimony. \n“Apparently so,” Burns said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:17:41.178+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
