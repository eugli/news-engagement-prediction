Happy birthday ,Sushma Swaraj! A look at the popular Twitter replies by Sushma Swaraj to random people asking for her help! By Vandana.Srivastawa | Published: February 14, 2017 7:00 AM IST Comments \nSushma Swaraj was born on February 14, 1952, and is one of the most prominent and powerful leaders of our country. Sushma Swaraj currently holds the portfolio of External Affairs in Prime Minister Narendra Modi ‘s cabinet. She is a former lawyer with the Supreme Court of India and has been elected seven times as a Member of Parliament and three times as Member of the Legislative Assembly. Sushma Swaraj became the youngest cabinet minister of the north Indian state of Haryana at the age of 25 in 1977. According to information available on her, Susham Swaraj also holds the credit of becoming the first woman chief minister of Delhi (1998) and first woman Union Cabinet Minister, as well as the first woman General Secretary, Spokesperson and Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha. \nSushma Swaraj is known for her oratory skills in Parliament and in politics in general. But as the Union External Affairs Minister, she is popular among the young and known well for her promptness in helping stranded Indians on foreign soil. She has become one of the most active union ministers on Twitter who is there to help Indian citizens with their problems, so much so that she has often been applauded for her quick and genuine replies. People have been emulating her and she has become a darling of most Indians! She is a no-bullshit person who does not take crap from people neither on the Parliament floor nor on Twitter. Her pro-activeness on the digital platform is laudable, but she is not there to entertain random requests and trolls. Her tweets are to the point and succinct and very rarely does she lower her guard and tweet anything of personal nature. Take a look at some of Sushma Swaraj’s Twitter conversations that are entertaining and yet reveal a lot about her professionalism. \nSome time back, one Twitter user thought it was okay to seek help from Sushma Swaraj because his refrigerator stopped working. He said, “@irvpaswan @SushmaSwaraj Samsung REFRIGERATOR (RT28K3922RZ/HL), bearing serial # (03E04PAH201870M). @Samsung_IN is forcing me go for repair.” @irvpaswan @SushmaSwaraj Samsung REFRIGERATOR (RT28K3922RZ/HL), bearing serial # (03E04PAH201870M). @Samsung_IN is forcing me go for repair. \n— Venkat (@M_VenkatM) June 13, 2016 \nTo this absurd tweet, Sushma Swaraj replied: Brother I cannot help you in matters of a Refrigerator. I am very busy with human beings in distress. https://t.co/cpC5cWBPcz \n— Sushma Swaraj (@SushmaSwaraj) June 13, 2016 \nIt is not easy being the go-to source for any passport or visa related problem, or Indians stranded abroad and matter of foreign policy, and yet Sushma Swaraj usually keeps her cool. But this time, she lost her temper when a nonsensical request came her way. A man tweeted to her seeking a transfer for his wife who works with the Indian Railways and is posted in a different city! Read the conversation here: @SushmaSwaraj Can u plz help us in ending our banwas in India? My wife is in Jhansi Rly employee and I work in Pune in IT. Been a year+. \n— Smit Raj. (@smitraj07) January 8, 2017 \nSushma Swaraj, not one to take things lightly, tweeted back sternly. If you or your wife were from my Ministry and such a request for transfer was made on twitter, I would have sent a suspension order by now. https://t.co/LImngQwFh6 \n— Sushma Swaraj (@SushmaSwaraj) January 8, 2017 \nBut owing to her soft and helpful nature, she directed the request to Suresh Prabhu, the Union Minister of Railways. @sureshpprabhu I have received this tweet. pic.twitter.com/gXhQAhQNA8 \n— Sushma Swaraj (@SushmaSwaraj) January 8, 2017 \nUnfortunately, the man was not lucky, as Suresh Prabhu informed him that he doesn’t look into transfers. 1/Thanks @SushmaSwaraj ji for bringing it to my notice.As per policy laid by me,I don’t look into transfers.Railway Board empowered for same https://t.co/WSqxinGx1u \n— Suresh Prabhu (@sureshpprabhu) January 8, 2017 \nSushma Swaraj as our External Affairs Minister means business but is also fun. She has a cool sense of humour and is a romantic at heart too. She shared this cool and romantic picture where she is seen with her husband Swaraj Kaushal holding hands when they bumped into each other in Parliament! Together after many years – a chance meeting with @governorswaraj at the Parliament House gate today. /1 pic.twitter.com/yHvD0NliSt \nShe had also shared a throwback picture of her with her husband on her wedding anniversary last year. Sushma Swaraj is still helping people while ailing in hospital! Thanks for your greetings and good wishes on our wedding anniversary. @sushmaswaraj & @GovernorSwaraj pic.twitter.com/d80OTAiMjc \n— Sushma Swaraj (@SushmaSwaraj) July 13, 2016 \nSushma Swaraj’s husband Governor Swaraj Kaushal also has an amazing sense of humour. Some time back a Twitter user asked Sushma Swaraj, “Hi mam @SushmaSwaraj ji, @governorswaraj is following you on Twitter but you don’t follow him, Can I ask why with all respect?”. But this time it was not Sushma Swaraj who answered but her husband Swaraj Kaushal, who said, ““I have followed her for 45 years – Can’t change things now”. Yes, this is a power couple in the real sense who have held hands for 45 years and still counting and have also kept the level of humour and love intact! \nThe well-loved leader that Sushma Swaraj is, she has made inroads into the hearts of our kids too, as is obvious from this girl dressed like the Minister in her school’s fancy dress competition. Sushma Swaraj, Virender Sehwag: Funniest tweets by Indians in 2016 \nTake a look here: \n— Rajesh Sharma (@Raj19Sharma) August 12, 2016 Oh ! I love your jacket. https://t.co/xionOXbg0O \n— Sushma Swaraj (@SushmaSwaraj) August 12, 2016 \nSushma Swaraj also is prompt in helping not just Indians abroad but also anyone who genuinely needs help from the country. If you are stranded, pl contact @ProtectorGenGOI with name/details of your agent. \n— Sushma Swaraj (@SushmaSwaraj) February 13, 2017 \nI have got report from our Consulate in San Francisco. The report says Vamshi was killed by a drug addict on Friday evening at Milpitas. /2 \n— Sushma Swaraj (@SushmaSwaraj) February 13, 2017 The culprit has been arrested. Our Consulate is in touch with your family. We assure you of all help and assistance. /3 \n— Sushma Swaraj (@SushmaSwaraj) February 13, 2017 \nAnd for that, she often gets tweets appreciating her efforts as External Affairs Minister of India.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T08:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:15:29.709+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
