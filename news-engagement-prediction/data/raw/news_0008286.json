Randa was surprised, as was the owner of the store that sold the beer. \n“For us, it was kind of exciting and it was a surprise, especially since we’re a brand new store. We just opened up in November,” said store owner Manuel Osorio. \n“I’m excited more than you even know, more than you can imagine,” Randa said. \nBeginning this year, Anheuser Busch will fly Randa and his wife to the game.
