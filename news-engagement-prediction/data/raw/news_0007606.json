He confronted Bethenny at their child's school, allegedly saying, \"I will destroy you.\" \nWe've learned the restraining order requires Hoppy to stay clear of Bethenny's home, school (presumably their 6-year-old daughter Bryn's school), and place of business. \nThe order also requires Jason to stay radio silent ... no communication with Bethenny. \nThe only exception for Hoppy is if a judge allows him access at the various locations to facilitate the custody arrangement. \nThere's one kind of vague part of the order ... Jason is not permitted to have any \"third party contact.\" Although the order does not specify the identity of third parties, it's safe to assume it includes Bethenny's boyfriend, Dennis Shields, who was with Bethenny when Jason got arrested . \nThe restraining order lasts 6 months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T05:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:32:37.120+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
