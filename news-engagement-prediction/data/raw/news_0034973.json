Maybe you proudly post them to Instagram and wait for the double taps to roll in, maybe you send them to your boo as a sort of PG-rated sext, or maybe you keep ‘em stored in a secret folder on your phone meant for your eyes only—you know, to sneak a swift peek at your guns when you need a quick pick-me-up. And this is fine! You should never feel ashamed of showing off your hard work or proudly admiring your gains, and if one person sees your gym selfie and gets inspired to go break a sweat, then you’ll have done your part in helping make the world a fitter, better place. So go ahead, embrace your gym selfie—because these celebrities sure as hell have. \nBelow you’ll find some of the fittest actors, models, and musicians posting photographic proof that they weren’t just engineered in a lab to have blockbuster biceps and action-hero abs, but indeed put in the time, effort, and dedication to sculpt bodies worth flaunting on the big screen and the red carpet. And sure, a lot of these photos aren’t *technically* selfies. But the stars themselves posted the pics to their own Instagram accounts, which means they’re just as pleased with their progress in the gym as you are. Click through to see how the rich and famous bench, box, squat, and spin their way to the fittest bodies in Hollywood—and steal a page or two for your own workout playbook.
