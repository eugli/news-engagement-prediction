Supplied / MPI \nTwo divers were caught with 565 scallops, 300 of which were undersized. \nA fisheries officer made a trip to the beach and found one of the divers emerging from the water carrying a catch-bag of 19 scallops, 52 scallops dumped on the water's edge and a catch-bag containing another 176 scallops in the water. \nREAD MORE: \n\"During the inspection, one of our officers was allegedly threatened by one of the divers,\" said Ministry for Primary Industries spokesman, Stephen Rudsdale. \n\"Our officers took the men's details and informed them they would be facing charges.\" \nBut that wasn't the last the officer would see of the pair; later that evening another member of the public reported two men acting suspiciously and apparently searching for something in the water in the same area. \nThe pair drove off towards Whangarei shortly after, but officers stopped the vehicle and recognised them as the same two they had dealt with earlier in the day. \nThe officers found two catch-bags containing a total of 318 scallops in the back of the vehicle. Ad Feedback \nThe scallop haul was more than 14 times the daily limit. \n\"Unfortunately, during the inspection, one of the men who was wearing gang insignia, became aggressive and threatened the officers. Police were then called,\" said Rudsdale. \n\"The men had allegedly taken 565 scallops in total, over 300 of which were under the legal size of 100mm.\" \nThe daily limit per diver is 20 scallops. \n\"This is extremely disappointing. What people need to remember is that this sort of excessive take threatens the sustainability of the scallop fishery and impacts the number of scallops available to other people. \n\"This was a premeditated, deliberate attempt to break the rules. MPI would like to thank the members of the public who reported the incidents. Their quick-thinking has enabled us to take action.\" \nTwo men, aged 30 and 38, face charges under the Fisheries Act for possessing excess and undersized scallops and threatening and obstructing fisheries officers. \nA 1997 Toyota Camry station wagon and dive gear was seized. \nRudsdale said some of the scallops were returned to the sea, but the scallops that had been out of the water for at least six hours were disposed of for heath reasons. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T10:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:53:00.838+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
