JAMES ALLAN \nSkid marks left by Barry Fitzgerald's McLaren F1 before it crashed on December 3. \nA police spokeswoman said Fitzgerald received diversion but would not disclose any conditions associated with it. \nREAD MORE: \n\"I've been advised his diversion has been 'completed',\" she said. MAARTEN HOLL/FAIRFAX NZ \nThe McLaren F1, estimated to be worth $20 million, photographed in Wellington before its crash near Queenstown. \nAsked at what speed the car was travelling before the crash and why police decided diversion was sufficient, the spokeswoman said police had no further comment. \nFitzgerald's lawyer Nic Soper was yet to respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. \nThe luxury car crashed into a ditch at Closeburn. The vehicle was one of a procession of 31 McLaren cars from across the world travelling from Auckland to Queenstown as part of the carmaker's Epic New Zealand Road Tour. \nProcession stewards reportedly tried to cover up the crash allegedly offering money to media and then trying to stop footage being recorded. \nThe 1994 McLaren F1 is capable of travelling at speeds of up to 386kmh and was at one stage the world's fastest production car before losing the title to the Bugatti Veyron. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:32:14.838+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
