I don't have any problem with that characterisation.\" \nMr Dutton said he expected refugee resettlement to the US to begin within \"the next couple of months\", despite recent tensions over the deal. \nMr Trump made the comments on Twitter, where he incorrectly labelled refugees \"illegal immigrants\" and cited \"thousands\" of people instead of 1,250. \nForeign Minister Julie Bishop, however, said she would not describe the two deals as a people swap. \nSpeaking to media in Washington, Ms Bishop would not be drawn on Mr Dutton's comments that Australia would not resettle people from Costa Rica without assurances from the US Government. \nShe instead stated that both the US and Australia were \"generous nations\" when it came to refugees. \n\"We will continue to take refugees from across the world, as we've always done,\" she said. \n\"It's always been subject to the consideration of the United States' consideration of those they wish to resettle and they are likewise a generous nation when it comes to resettling refugees and I'm sure they'll continue to do so.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:37:25.640+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
