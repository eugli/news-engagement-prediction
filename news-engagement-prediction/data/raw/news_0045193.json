But there are some celebs who seem to get into the drama more than others, Adam Lambert possibly being one of them. \nThe rocker seems to have attracted some gossip and disses from many of his colleagues in the music biz over the years. So when Adam appeared on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen Thursday night, he was asked to spill on all of the feuds that he's been involved in or at the center of during his career. \nFirst, host Andy Cohen asked Adam about one of the nastier ones from 2011, when Adam Levine said on The Voice that he wasn't familiar with Adam Lambert's song \"Whataya Want from Me,\" but that the contestant \"probably sang it better than the person that sang it originally.\" \"That was high shade! I was like, 'Ow, Adam!'\" Adam Lambert said of the moment, before possibly throwing some shade of his own at the Maroon 5 frontman: \"Like, our initials are the same. People call me Adam Levine all the time.\" Adam Levine, Shirtless and Holding His 5-Day Old Baby Girl, Is Officially a DILF \nAdam got even shadier when looking back on some comments he made about Susan Boyle , saying that her cover of the Rolling Stones' \"Wild Horses\" made him laugh until he cried, to which Perez Hilton responded by insinuating that Adam was just jealous that her album was outselling his in 2010. When Andy asked if Adam thought Susan is underrated, overrated, or untalented, he said, \"I don't think anyone remembers who she is, really.\" To which Andy exclaimed, \"Oh, that's some shade!\" \nNow, you would think that Demi Lovato choosing to go on tour with Nick Jonas after she was originally set to perform with Adam in 2015 would have caused quite the beef. However, Adam said that he has been in touch with Demi since then and totally understands why she decided to go in a different direction. \"Yes, actually right after it happened we were texting because I adore her. We did Glee together,\" Adam told Andy. \"I mean, they have the same manager. What manager would not want their two artists on one tour?\" \nAnd what about those rumors that Adam and Selena Gomez were going to plan a \"Demi takedown tour\" as a result? \"No, I don't know Selena Gomez,\" Adam confirmed. \"But that would be fun. We should challenge them to that.\" \nAdam also exchanged barbs with KISS frontman Gene Simmons back in the day, who once said that the American Idol runner-up \"killed his career\" when he officially came out as gay in a 2009 Rolling Stone cover story because the conversation would now be about his sexuality and not about his talent. But prior to that, Gene had invited Adam to tour with KISS . Andy asked Adam if he would ever perform with the iconic rock band. \"I did on Idol . He kind of reminds me of Donald Trump 's track record. It's like, one minute this, one minute, that, contradicting. He's really friendly,\" Adam said sarcastically. \nSpeaking of Idol , Adam was noticeably absent from its series finale last April, but he had a good, not shady, reason. \"I did an episode a couple weeks before that, and then I was filming Rocky Horror in Toronto,\" the singer said. \nWell, here's hoping none of Adam's comments on WWHL reignite these feuds â€” or start new ones. \nWatch Adam and This Is Us star Chrissy Metz talk about some other haters on WWHL , below.
