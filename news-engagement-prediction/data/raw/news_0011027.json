COMPARISONS \nThe magnitude of this event is why it’s often considered as the Super Bowl of wrestling, with plenty of fans tuning in to see what goes down on both nights, and even though they’re in two different worlds, the comparisons simply won’t end.

Article continues below \nAfter trying to tread carefully around the subject, The Viper eventually succumbed and revealed that The Grandest Stage of Them All is bigger than the NFL’s Big Game. WRESTLEMANIA VS. SUPER BOWL \nHe said: “WrestleMania is the Super Bowl of wrestling. Royal Rumble is getting in, winning the Royal Rumble is getting into the Super Bowl of wrestling. \n“Screw the Super Bowl, we’re talking about WrestleMania. Super Bowl ain’t got s**t on WrestleMania! \n“WrestleMania is the biggest show on earth, the grandest show on earth, and I feel like everyone knows that, worldwide. \n“I’m gonna main event that show, and it’s because I won the Royal Rumble. That’s why I’m here, to meet the fans and talk about that. \n\"Everyone congratulated me and they want me to beat John Cena, take the title, put the gold around my waist, and that’s what I’m gonna do.” \nOrton couldn’t have picked a worse time to come out with those comments, as football fans are bound to hit out at him ahead of the all-important clash between the Atlanta Falcons and the New England Patriots on Sunday night. \nWhat do you make of Randy Orton’s Super Bowl comments?
