I think there’s every reason why we [should] go this full tilt and get it done within two years. But let’s see how it goes.”\nThe Government has conceded a vote on any deal agreed with the EU before the European Parliament starts its consideration, probably in late 2018.\nBut the Prime Minister has warned it will be a ‘take-it-or-leave-it’ choice – insisting she will take Britain crash out of the EU with no deal at all, if her terms are rejected.\nWTO rules would mean hefty export tariffs on, for example, dairy products (36 per cent), cars (ten per cent), food and drink (20 per cent) and clothing and textiles (10-20 per cent).\nRead more BMW considers moving production of electric Mini to Germany from UK Teenagers blame parents for 'poisoned legacy' of Brexit UK firms call for Brexit to be delayed if a trade deal isn't struck EU nationals express panic after Home Office changes residency rules Treasury documents leaked to The Times last year highlighted the predicted cost of leaving both the EU’s single market and customs union.\nThey suggested lost tax revenues of up to £66bn a year and that the UK’s gross domestic product (GDP) could fall by as much as 9.5 per cent if it reverts to WTO terms.\nThis morning, the British Chambers of Commerce urged Ms May to delay Brexit if she is unable to strike a comprehensive trade deal within the two-year negotiating period leading up to the split.\nIn a report based on feedback from more than 400 businesses, it said the Government needed to provide “solutions and certainty” to businesses before the divorce was finalised.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T21:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T16:59:22.616+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
