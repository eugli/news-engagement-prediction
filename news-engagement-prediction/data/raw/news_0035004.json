Nancy Hixt reports. \nGlobal News has confirmed Rasberry was arrested Monday morning and charged with three counts of breaching conditions of his release as well as one count of resisting arrest. \nCourt documents allege Rasberry was intoxicated and refused to provide breath samples to the RCMP in Canmore. \nIt’s also alleged he attempted to shut the door on officers at a hotel. \nLast November, the prosecution asked a panel of appeal court justices for a murder conviction, while defence proposed Rasberry be acquitted. \nKelloway was stabbed 37 times in Rasberry’s Auburn Bay home on May 4, 2013. \nWatch below from October 2015: A disturbing 911 confession was played in court from a man accused of murdering his neighbour, a Calgary teacher. Nancy Hixt reports. \nThe Crown pointed to the fact that three knives were used as proof it was not self defence, suggesting Rasberry made a choice to “put Mr. Kelloway down.” \nDefence argued Kelloway was threatening to rape Rasberry and that he was provoked. \nThe original trial judge found Rasberry was not acting in self defence, but also said he didn’t feel there was an intent to kill. \nIn December 2015, Rasberry was sentenced to seven years in jail-but with credit for time served, he was left with five years and four months in his sentence. \nSoon after, the Court of Appeal granted Rasberry bail pending the appeal. \nThe victim’s family has told Global News they want a new trial.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T04:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:18:41.161+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
