Owning the whole chain cuts out the middleman fees,\" said Mr Banker.\nEconomic boost The Governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin, said the plans for the cargo hub were \"exciting\".\n\"Kentucky's ideal location, proven workforce and an already extensive shipping and logistics industry have been the backbone of our relationship with Amazon for nearly 20 years.\n\"This new project will pay dividends to both the company and our state and we are truly grateful for the jobs and economic impact it will bring.\"\nThe chief executive of the airport, Candace McGraw, called the hub \"transformational\" for the economy and businesses in the area.\nLast month, Amazon said it will create 100,000 new, full-time jobs across the US by mid-2018 and also revealed plans to open new warehouses in Texas, Maryland and Colorado .\nThe company also completed its first commercial drone delivery in the UK at the end of last year, with a package delivered to an address in Cambridge 13 minutes after being ordered.", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-38320067", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/141E2/production/_93920428_amazonair.jpg", "http://phoenix.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2237998", "http://phoenix.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2238986", "http://phoenix.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2241026", "https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=3330451", "http://phoenix.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2237110", "http://phoenix.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2238204"], "published": "2017-02-02T15:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T05:34:27.144+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
