The officer estimated the cars were traveling in excess of 100 miles per hour, Ferrelli said. \nWhen he turned on his lights and siren, one of the cars stopped for the red light at Ohio while Rodriguez continued through the light, eventually pulling over near Fulton and Smith, Ferrelli said. \nUpon investigation, police said that Rodriguez was showing signs of impairment for which she was ultimately charged, Ferrelli said. \nInformation on the other car was not contained in the police report, Ferrelli said. \nRodriguez was previously found guilty of drunken driving in 2013 in Kendall County, records show. \nShe was booked at 2:36 a.m. Saturday and given a 10 percent bond set at $300, then released later that morning, according to Aurora police reports. \nTwitter @hannahmleone", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:36:11.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
