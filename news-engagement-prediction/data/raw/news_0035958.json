Since his grandson Michael Audette was a toddler, Carriere was passing along his love of the instrument. \n“I was so happy when I saw him as a boy and he was playing. And he just loved it. He would sooner play than eat I think,” Carriere said . \nThe duo would practice playing for hours. \n“We started just practicing the two of us. One in front of each other. He would teach me a tune and we would go back and forth,” Audette said. \nAt 88-years-old Carriere knew it was time to put the bow down, but he wanted to keep the music alive. \nFor Audette’s 23rd birthday, he was gifted his grandfather’s fiddle. \n“When he passed me the fiddle I said I thought you were going to play forever. He said I will, you will,” Audette said. \n“To open my fiddle case and know that it’s there and just to know there’s so much history on that fiddle. People have heard it play for 50 years.” \nMichael Audette’s love of the fiddle started at a young age. This photo shows Audette playing a plastic fiddle at two years old.

You got the boots, right up to the vest and the fiddle, the little cherry on top,” Audette said. \nThe vest even has a balding spot from where the fiddle rests on his shoulder. \nAudette has been performing at Festival du Voyageur this year, one of his favourite places to play. \n“Like grandpa said, you touch the strings with the bow and everyone turns,” he said. \n“When I perform at festival it’s so different than performing anywhere else everyone comes for the traditional music instead of pop music. And it means a lot to me because I came from that.” \nYou can see Audette playing: \nFebruary 17: Norwood Hotel at 10 p.m. \nFebruary 18: Festival du Voyageur trading post at 7 p.m. \nFebruary 18: Maison Chaboillez at 8:15 p.m. \nFebruary 18: Norwood Hotel at 10 p.m. \nFebruary 25: Cabane a Sucre at 12:15 p.m. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
