Priebus said he was getting “crushed” on the story and asked what they could do about it. McCabe said he’d get back to him. \nLater, McCabe called Priebus and said the FBI would “love to help” but couldn’t say anything publicly. McCabe said that they couldn’t make statements on every story, White House officials said Friday. Priebus asked if he could cite “senior intelligence officials” as saying there was “nothing to” the Times story. McCabe gave his permission, the administration officials said. \nFBI Director James Comey called Priebus and reiterated McCabe’s sentiments, the officials said. \nPriebus told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday that the “top levels of the intelligence community” had assured him that the Times story is “not only inaccurate” but”grossly overstated” and “wrong.” \nFor his part, Trump railed against what he called the FBI’s inability to stop “leakers” Friday. \n“The FBI is totally unable to stop the national security ‘leakers’ that have permeated our government for a long time,” Trump tweeted. “They can’t even find the leakers within the FBI itself.” \n“Classified information is being given to media that could have a devastating effect on U.S. FIND NOW,” he added. \nFollow Business Insider Australia on Facebook , Twitter , LinkedIn , and Instagram .
