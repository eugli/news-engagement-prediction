Image Group LA via Getty Images \n\nPrice Waterhouse has now issued a statement on the debacle, revealing they handed Warren and Faye the wrong envelope to present the award with. \nThey also confirmed an investigation is currently underway to establish how the gaffe happened. \nThey said: “We sincerely apologize to ‘Moonlight’, ‘La La Land’, Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, and Oscar viewers for the error that was made during the award announcement for Best Picture. \n“The presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope and when discovered, was immediately corrected. We are currently investigating how this could have happened, and deeply regret that this occurred.” \nThey added: “We appreciate the grace with which the nominees, the Academy, ABC, and Jimmy Kimmel handled the situation.” Lucy Nicholson / Reuters \nWarren made an attempt to explain what had happened while still on stage, telling the audience: “I want to tell you what happened. I opened the envelope and it said Emma Stone, ‘La La Land.’ \n“That’s why I took such a long look at Faye and at you. I wasn’t trying to be funny.” \nAfter that monumental cock-up was sorted out, ‘Moonlight’ left the ceremony with three Academy Awards, including Best Film, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor. \nMeanwhile, ‘La La Land’ went home with six gongs, including one for Damien Chazelle, who became the youngest ever recipient of Best Director gong, as well as Best Actress (Emma Stone), Best Musical Score, Best Song, Best Cinematography and Best Production Design.
