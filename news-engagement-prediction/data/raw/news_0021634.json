The teachers, who trekked over eight kilometres along major routes in Calabar, went to the Cross River State House of Assembly and the Governor’s office to present letters of grievance to the Speaker, Mr. John Gaul-Lebo; and Governor Ben Ayade respectively. PUNCH Metro had reported that a Civic Education teacher, Mr. Owai Owai, had on Thursday flogged 10 pupils of Senior Secondary School 3, for forcing some Junior Secondary School pupils to sweep their (SSS3) classroom when classes had commenced. One of the SSS3 pupils was said to have called her mother, Mrs. Asuquo, a DSS official, on the telephone, who reportedly raced to the school and invited her colleagues. The DSS officials stormed the college premises, shooting indiscriminately. They reportedly flogged Owai, and other teachers, who attempted to caution them. The protest by members of the association, which is an affiliate of the Trade Union Congress, also attracted officials of the state chapter of the Nigeria Union of Teachers. In the letter titled, ‘A case of threat to lives, molestation and abduction of students and attempted murder of teachers in the FGGC, Calabar, which was delivered separately to the Speaker and the governor, the protesters urged the government to properly investigate the matter. The letter was endorsed by chairman and secretary of ASCSN, Udofa V.M., and Emore M.E., respectively. The state Chairman of TUC, Mr. Clarkson Otu, who presented the letter on behalf of the teachers said, “We are here to protest against the brutal attack on our colleagues at the FGGC, Calabar, by officials of the DSS on February 2. We know that the DSS is not under your control, but we have come to register our grievance. “We know you will use your good offices to ensure that the matter is not swept under the carpet. This matter is before you and we want justice. We want the matter to be properly investigated so that those behind this brutality are punished.” The Clerk of the House, Mr. Bassey Ekpenyong, who received the letter on behalf of the Speaker, promised that the matter would not be swept under the carpet. He decried the action of the DSS officials, stating that the attack on the teachers was unwarranted. “This letter will get to its destinantion. We will ensure that justice is served,” he said. Fatai Ibrahim | Punch Newspapers FGGC Also, a Director at the office of State Security Adviser, Mr. Etam Eno, who received the letter on behalf of Ayade, promised that a meeting would be called between the management of the school and the DSS to resolve the matter amicably. Eno, who said the governor was aware of the development, promised that justice would be done. Meawhile, the brutalised teachers’ lawyer, First Baba Issa, who has been handling the case, told one of our correspondents on Tuesday that the Federal Ministry of Education had invited him for a meeting on the incident, adding that the state Assembly had pledged to ensure that the operatives were brought to book “I have spoken with the Federal Ministry of Education and we have scheduled a meeting for tomorrow (Wednesday). I was asked to bring another petition that would be addressed to a particular official. We are looking forward to the outcome of the meeting. “The protest was successful and we love the response of the state House of Assembly. The lawmakers have promised to use their political will to bring the DSS operatives to justice. So, we are awaiting the action of the Assembly.” Responding to an inquiry by PUNCH Metro on the attack, the spokesperson for the education ministry, Priscillia Ihuma, said, “Come to the Federal Ministry of Education to get your facts like other journalists? You will get in-depth answers that way. Thanks.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
