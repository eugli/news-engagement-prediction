Leila De limaINQUIRER FILE PHOTO/ MARIANNE BERMUDEZ \nSenator Leila de Lima was a highly paid lawyer who switched focus mid-career to human rights, a decision that would draw her into the deadly world of President Rodrigo Duterte. \nDe Lima was arrested Friday on drug trafficking charges she insisted were manufactured to silence her opposition to Duterte’s anti-crime crackdown, which has claimed more than 6,500 lives in eight months. \nREAD: After awaiting arrest at Senate, De Lima turns self in to CIDG ADVERTISEMENT \nDe Lima, 57, began her career as one of the brightest legal prospects in the Philippines, having scored the eighth highest mark in the country’s bar exams in 1985. \nShe worked as a law clerk for the House of Representatives and as a legal aide of a Supreme Court associate justice, while building a successful law practice that specialized in helping prominent politicians in election court challenges. \nDe Lima helped now-Senate President Aquilino Pimentel Jr. to unseat a senate election rival, and future senator Alan Peter Cayetano beat a suit alleging he was not a Filipino citizen and therefore not qualified to run for office. \nIronically, Pimentel and Cayetano are now among the most powerful allies of Duterte, a longtime mayor of the southern city of Davao who won presidential elections last year after promising to kill tens of thousands of criminals. \nDe Lima’s life turned in 2008 when she accepted her first government post as chairwoman of the government’s independent Commission on Human Rights. \nDuring two years in the job she worked with a small team of lowly paid lawyers, investigating extrajudicial killings, abductions and human rights violations by the Philippines’ notoriously corrupt security forces. \nAnother one of her main targets was Duterte, who had for years faced allegations of running death squads in Davao that killed hundreds of drug addicts and petty criminals as part of a ruthless anti-crime campaign. \nDe Lima opened a probe into the so-called Davao Death Squads. \nShe left the commission with the probe unfinished in 2010 to become justice secretary in the administration of Benigno Aquino, who swept to power on a pledge to fight corruption. \nAs justice secretary she prosecuted cases linked to the misuse of huge amounts of legislators’ so-called pork-barrel funds, and raided the country’s biggest prison to dismantle the perks accorded to inmates convicted of drug offences. \nShe left the cabinet in late 2015 to run for the Senate, winning a seat last year at the same time Duterte was elected president. \nAs Duterte launched a Davao-style anti-crime crackdown across the Philippines that would go on to claim thousands of lives, De Lima was one of the few politicians willing to criticize him. \nREAD: Duterte is Philippines’ ‘No. 1 criminal’—De Lima \n“I will have to destroy her in public,” Duterte said in August last year, and then proceeded to build a case alleging she was one of the nation’s biggest drug traffickers. \n“Throughout my entire life, I never imagined myself becoming a victim of a human rights violation myself,” De Lima, a divorced mother of two, said in October as she insisted the charges against her were absurd. \nJust before her arrest at the Senate on Friday morning, De Lima again insisted on her innocence while remaining characteristically defiant. \n“They are mistaken if they are hoping that they will silence me and stop my fight for truth, justice and against the daily killings and repression by the Duterte regime,” she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T05:25:35.309+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
