She contacted Gerber and Walmart, where she bought the Puffs. \nConsumer Justice contacted Gerber as well, and learned the company has strict guidelines to prevent this type of issue. \nThe company said employees are not allowed to bring anything into the room where Puffs are made and packaged. They’re not even allowed to wear shirts with pockets, just to be safe. \nGerber said it is investigating Davis’s report, and that it has received no other reports like this. \nDavis, whose Facebook post has been shared more than 74,000 times, says she wants Gerber to increase safety.
