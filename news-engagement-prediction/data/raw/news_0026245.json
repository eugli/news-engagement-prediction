More videos Xenophon won't back welfare changes \nThe government's omnibus savings bill has met with resistance, with Senator Nick Xenophon declaring his party won't vote for the legislation. \nBut crossbench kingmaker Nick Xenophon officially torpedoed the plan on Tuesday, saying the trade-off was simply \"too harsh\". \n\"As a negotiating tactic, this is as subtle as a sledgehammer. Pitting battling Australians against Australians needing disability support services is dumb policy and even dumber politics,\" Senator Xenophon said.
