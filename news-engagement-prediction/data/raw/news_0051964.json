The image, via StarWars.com , shows the core cast and directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. Let's take a closer look and then run through the faces: \nSo, from left to right... \nLeft top, Woody Harrelson: Woody Harrelson will be playing Han Solo's mentor Garris Shrike . In Star Wars lore the character first appeared in the 1997 book The Paradise Snare. He raised Han Solo alongside a female Wookiee and taught him all about being a smuggler and ne'er-do-well. \nLeft Bottom, Chris Millar: Millar is co-director along side Phil Lord (who's second from the right). Together the pair have directed movies like 21 Jump Street, The Lego Movie and Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs. It suggests we might be getting a lighter, more comedic tone here, befitting a wise-cracking space rogue. \nLeft middle top, Phoebe Waller-Bridge: Naughty Phoebe litearlly denied any knowledge of being in the film last week, calling it 'all rumours'. Those rumours point to the Fleabag star playing a female droid in the Han Solo movie via CG and motion capture. \nMiddle left, Alden Ehrenreich: Meet your new Solo. Ehrenreich's casting was confirmed at the last Star Wars Celebration. And that's about all we have for now on the Hail, Caesar! and Beautiful Creatures actor. Reportedly he was one of the first people to audition for the role of Han and has met up with Harrison Ford to swap notes. \nMiddle right, Emilia Clarke: We don't know anything about the part the Game of Thrones actress is playing yet, which makes me think she might be playing an existing, or known character. \nMiddle top, Chewbacca: Played here by Finnish basketball player Joonas Suotamo. He stepped in for the now 72-year-old Peter Mayhew in The Force Awakens, and looks to be taking over the role completely for the spin off. \nMiddle right, Phil Lord: Co-director with Chris Millar. \nRight, Donald Glover: Glover was always top of the running to play a young Lando Calrissian. He's already met with the original, Billy Dee Williams , and is clear on one thing: the character has to be cool . \nDirected by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, and starring Alden Ehrenreich, Donald Glover, and Emilia Clarke the Han Solo movie is due to be released on May 25, 2018. \nSeen something newsworthy?
