Ken was struck down by a stroke in November (Photo: ITV) Ken collapsed last year (Photo: ITV) \n\"He is rushed to hospital and his life is very much hanging in the balance. Obviously for someone who was so recently ill, the chances of him coming out of it alive – let alone unscathed – are drastically reduced.\" \nKen's storyline comes as actress Helen Flanagan reprises her role of Rosie Webster on Monday, 6 February, making a surprise return to the cobbles alongside sister Sophie Webster. \nSophie has been visiting Rosie in Miami and, dragging Kevin Webster outside, she reveals she’s brought a surprise home - Rosie! \nRosie emerges from the taxi followed by a huge amount of luggage, chattering away about what she’s been up to since we last saw her on screen. \nBut will her return bring a whole lot of trouble to the family? \nCoronation Street boss Kate Oates has already hinted there will be major drama, telling Radio Times: \"Rosie is such a colourful character - I thought it'd be great for Sophie. \n\"I wanted to see Sophie led up the garden path a little bit and to see her in a bit of trouble. \n\"And I think that Rosie will cause Sophie a lot of headaches.\" \nThere have been rumours that Rosie's return storyline is linked to a drugs scandal . \nIt's thought police soon turn up after Rosie’s return, as she’s a suspect for smuggling drugs into the UK from America - however, no illegal substances are found during a raid of the Webster home. \nBut an insider claims the cocaine is hidden deeply inside a packet of sweets that Sophie uncovers, leading the sisters to take dramatic action and bury it in Ken Barlow’s garden - but Adam spots them in the act. \nHe then persuades the girls to let him sell the drugs. \nBut that doesn't exactly work out as planned when their dad Kevin find out and confronts Adam. \n\"Rosie tells Sophie someone planted the drugs on her, and is as shocked as her sister when she sees the white powder,\" a source told The Sun. \n\"The girls panic and decide to bury the drugs but Adam Barlow finds out what they have done and offers to sell the drugs for a fee. \n\"But, Kevin’s business is struggling following an arson attack and he needs money. So he takes matters into his own hands.\" \nRosie left Weatherfield to star in a reality TV show in February 2012, viewers have seen mum Sally head off to visit her on numerous occasions but Rosie has never come home - until now! \nConfirming her return last year, a thrilled Helen said: \"I'm so excited to be returning to Coronation Street and being part of the Webster family again.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T15:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T10:35:32.929+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
