Each person who follows is given a corresponding number. \nREAD MORE: \nEach person must check in several times a day until the day of the concert. If they miss a roll call, they lose their number. \nThose who make every roll call enter the show in the order they first arrived. \nOn the eve of the concert, hundreds still have their numbers as they check in for the third time of the day. \nThe Christchurch roll call began with local Glen McCartney, who claimed the number one spot at 11am on Friday. As the first in the queue, he took on much of the responsibility; he arrives at 6am each day to check-in his fellow fans. \n\"It's a lot of work. I'm here 11, 12 hours a day,\" he said. \nHe wasn't the first to arrive. An Auckland woman was, but she gave up her number one spot because he was a local. \nBeing number one meant he could go right up to the stage, metres away from Springsteen. \n\"He gave me his harmonica in Auckland in 2014. That was something special.\" \nNumber four in the line, Tresca Forrester, said the Christchurch roll call was made up of people from around the globe. \n\"We've got about 50 per cent locals in the line, but we've got people from the UK, Australia, America and a whole lot of European countries as well. It's quite remarkable.\" \nShe said The Boss's first Christchurch show would be a special one. \n\"He's going to sing City of Ruins â€“ that's a given.\" - Stuff ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T15:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T10:38:21.454+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
