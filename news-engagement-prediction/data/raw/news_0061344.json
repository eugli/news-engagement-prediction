Investigators believe he was using headphones and distracted by his phone. (CBC)\nSome years, however, there were no fatalities at all.\nThe intersection at 36th Street at 12th Avenue N.E. is the deadliest with six deaths. In fact, 36th Street N.E. seems to have more than its share of fatalities, with 19 since the northeast line opened in 1985.\n\"The high-risk locations that are often identified are also the areas that have the most vehicles that go through them,\" Whitelaw said.\n\"Where you have got retail nearby, some of the larger malls, we do tend to see higher passenger counts ... which could potentially play a role in why we see greater frequency of accidents at certain locations and not others.\"\nCalgary Transit says a headphone ban near LRT stations may have to be considered to reduce fatalities, but commuters watching out for each other is considered the best safety option. (Calgary Transit)\nWhitelaw said all the safety systems in the world wouldn't likely bring the fatality count to zero. That, he said, would not cost a thing if more people would simply keep their eyes open for their fellow passengers.\n\"Zero requires support from all of our users. We need people to look out for each other. We need people to unplug,\" Whitelaw said.\n\"The real secret to safety is if we can break down barriers between individuals who use transit so that they do look out for each other. The safest transit systems certainly incorporates technology but ultimately it's the users of the transit systems themselves that make these systems very, very safe.\"\nMORE ALBERTA NEWS | Andre Chabot coy about run for Calgary mayor, but website shell isn't MORE ALBERTA NEWS | Medicine Hat mumps outbreak prompts alert as virus hits hockey team With files from Colleen Underwood", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T08:16:16.668+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
