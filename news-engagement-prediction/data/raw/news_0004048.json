At the time, she was an alderman and went by the name Jeff. \nShe came out as transgender last fall to her colleagues at Town Hall and to her customers as a self-employed computer technician. \nThe newspaper says her wife knew the truth early in their relationship. © 2017 The Canadian Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T08:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T01:07:02.655+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
