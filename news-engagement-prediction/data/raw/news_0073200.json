But the real story behind the story is that the organizations shut out all have been reporting on Trump’s Russia ties. \nThe Trump team wants this story to go away. They’re scared. And this week’s earlier big story that Sean Spicer Reince Priebus unsuccessfully sought the FBI’s help to refute the stories about those Russia ties seems to be just the tip of this latest iceberg. The Trump team sought help from top officials at other intel agencies, and apparently got it. The Trump team sought help from members of Congress, and got it. Which demands further investigation, particularly as it calls into question the ability of those agencies or the Republican majority Congress to investigate Trump’s Russia ties. Who were these officials? Did these White House efforts constitute obstruction of justice? \nThese efforts speak for themselves. The Trump team wants the Russia stories to go away. Which is why, more than ever, everyone should be focused on them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T07:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:50:07.761+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
