Other cars used on the line have also been pulled from service after inspectors saw indications of similar cracks, though other cars used on the line have been inspected and cleared for service. In July, 120 Regional Rail cars were pulled from service, a third of the fleet, after inspectors found a systemic flaw in the welds on another load bearing part, the equalizer beams. That discovery caused a scheduling nightmare for train riders throughout the summer. \nCity transit riders experienced their own transportation chaos in November, when workers responsible for operating subways, trolleys, and buses in the city went on strike for a week, shuttering those services. \nStarting Monday, the shortage of Market Frankford Line cars will create reduced service during peak hours. Riders should expect delays and crowded cars, SEPTA reported in a press release. The authority is also providing additional bus service to suppliment the reduced subway service. \nA press conference is planned Monday afternoon to elaborate on the troubles with the rail cars.
