That show half the voters did not exercise their franchise, which under democrcy, is nothing short of a sin. However, that was not the course of action adopted by some of the busiest corporate chiefs in the country. The busiest of them all would surely have been none other than N Chandrasekaran, the new chairman of Tata Sons, who took over the reigns from veteran Ratan Tata today. He cast his vote today, prioritising it above all his professional engagements; including the taking over as the chairman of country’s largest business house. \nPopularly known as Chandra, the new Tata Sons’ chairman was spotted with inked finger at the Bombay House after completing the first board meeting; as the chairman of the USD 103-billion salt to software empire. Most of the news from Mumbai came from the polling booths today, as the western metropolis is geared up to elect a new civic body for BMC – the richest municipal corporation body in Asia! \nYou may also like to watch this video : \nApart from the Tata Sons chairman, other corporates seen at the voting booths were HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh and Keki Mistry, chairman.
