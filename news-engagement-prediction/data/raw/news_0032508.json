Key points: Nearly 100 aftershocks felt as emergency workers try to rapidly access damage More casualties feared within one of the city's villages, schools being used as evacuation centres Airport closed after cracks discovered in runway while a major port was also shut \nThe late Friday quake with a magnitude of 6.5 roused residents from sleep in the Surigao del Norte province, sending hundreds fleeing from their homes. External Link: Tweet: USGS shares a map of the earthquake \nThe quake was centred about 14 kilometres north-west of the provincial capital of Surigao at a relatively shallow depth of 11 kilometres, said Renato Solidum of the Philippine Institute of Seismology and Volcanology. \nNearly 100 aftershocks have been felt, officials said, adding that schools were being reopened as evacuation centres for residents wary of returning to their damaged homes. \nMr Solidum said the quake was set off by movement in the Philippine fault, which sits in the Pacific \"Ring of Fire\" where quakes and volcanoes are common. \nA number of people were killed, some after being hit by falling debris and blunt objects, provincial disaster-response official Gilbert Gonzales said. \nAt least 126 others were injured in Surigao city, about 700 kilometres south-east of Manila. \n\"We're still doing a rapid needs and damage assessment,\" Office of Civil Defense director Antonio Gonzales said. \nSeveral mostly low-slung buildings and schools sustained cracks in the coastal city and a bridge collapsed in an outlying town. \nRescue teams were checking for possible casualties in a village called Poknoy in the city of 140,500 people, he said. \nThe city's airport was temporarily closed due to cracks in the runway, aviation officials said. \nA major port in Lipata district also was closed while engineers checked the stability of an access road, Mr Gonzales said. \n\"The shaking was so strong I could hardly stand,\" coast guard personnel Rayner Neil Elopre said. \nVillage leaders asked residents to move to a school building on higher ground, Mr Elopre said, pausing briefly during a mild aftershock while talking on the phone. \nPolice officer Jimmy Sarael said he, his wife and two children embraced each other until the shaking eased. \nThey later moved to the moonlit grounds outside the provincial capitol complex to join more than 1,000 jittery residents, he said. \nThe last major earthquake that struck Surigao, an impoverished region also dealing with a communist insurgency, was in the 1800s, Mr Solidum said. \nA magnitude 7.7 quake killed nearly 2,000 people on the northern island of Luzon in 1990. \nAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T15:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T16:23:48.857+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
