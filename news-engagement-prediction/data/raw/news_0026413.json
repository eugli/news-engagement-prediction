A spokesperson for Saifee Hospital said Ms Aty was given blood thinners in the days leading up to the transfer to prevent her from suffering a pulmonary embolism\nShe was then, very carefully, lifted out of the truck and on to the plane, where she was then flown to the hospital with her sister by her side\nAs a child (left), Ms Aty was diagnosed with elephantiasis which caused her body to swell up and increase her weight dramatically\nWhat is Elephantiasis? Elephantiasis is a disease which causes a person's body to swell up to huge proportions.\nIt is caused by an obstruction of the lymphatic system, which causes fluid to be accumulated in certain areas of the body.\nArms and legs are often the two main areas which are affected.\nSome cases of the disease are treated with medicine, which battles the underlying issues. However, many people have surgery.\nAround the same time she dropped out of primary school and tragically suffering a cerebral stroke, which left her bedridden and exacerbated her conditions, causing her to remain in her room.\nShe has suffered paralysis in right leg and right arm.\nPrior to her flight, a special bed was created for her in line with the requirements needed to transport her safely to Mumbai.\nSpecial equipment was also installed in the cargo plane in case of an emergency, including a portable ventilator, portable defibrillator, oxygen cylinder, intubation laryngoscope and drugs.\nAs she approached 78 stone, her family posted a desperate plea online to Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi asking for medical assistance.\nAfter hearing about her case, Dr Muffazal Lakdawala offered to carry out the procedure free of charge.\nHer request for a visa was initially rejected, prompting Lakdawala in December to tweet a request for help to India's foreign minister Sushma Swaraj.\nAt the time Swaraj was in hospital awaiting a kidney transplant but was quick to respond with an offer of help.\nMs Aty has had a long wait as no airliners were willing to fly her from Egypt to India due to possible health complications.\nDr Lakdawala previously said: 'Transporting Eman to Mumbai is a challenging task keeping in mind the complexities of her case as she is a high risk patient who has not been able to move or leave the house for the past 25 years.'\nBariatric surgery is increasingly common in India, which has a growing problem with obesity, particularly in urban areas.\nIndia is a key destination for medical tourists because it offers quality services at a fraction of the cost of western countries and no waiting lists.", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-11T17:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T19:35:47.142+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
