What are we to do now? We will die together,\" one herder told the BBC Cows that used to sell for $500 (Â£400) each now sell for $100 because they are so thin. The government promised to buy the animals to mitigate the losses but herders told the BBC they have not received such an offer. As water dries up, the few watering holes left in Marsabit are getting busy. People are walking as long as 10km (6.2 miles) each way to get water. Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta has declared the drought a national emergency and has appealed for international aid. Kenya's Red Cross says 2.7 million people face starvation if more help is not provided. \"If it doesn't rain, this will be a catastrophe. We might lose lives, not animal lives this time, but humans,\" the head of the county's drought management authority, Guyo Gulicha, said.
