Rec Malcolm Butler is a solid cornerback. He did not, however, have a chance at this double move from Taylor Gabriel . Please call 911. Butler was cooked from the moment Gabriel began that move. He started to go with him and Gabriel cut back the other way so quick it was over. Gone. Dead. Deflated. Done. Pick your adjective, they all work. Like, a big story this week was that Butler wanted a chance at Jones, which is great that he’s confident. But, uh, he couldn’t handle Gabriel. Here lies Malcolm Butler, 1990 to 2017. He had a good career and a better life. He will be missed.
