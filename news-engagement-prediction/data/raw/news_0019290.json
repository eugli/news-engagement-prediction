Fireworks and explosions are based on chemistry, so it's definitely not a boring science . If you take classes in chemistry, you'll apply math and logic, which can make studying chemistry a challenge if you are weak in those areas. However, anyone can understand the basics of how things work... and that's the study of chemistry. In a nutshell, the importance of chemistry is that it explains the world around you. Chemistry Explains... Cooking Chemistry explains how food changes as you cook it, how it rots, how to preserve food, how your body uses the food you eat, and how ingredients interact to make food.\n\ncontinue reading below our video 4 Tips for Improving Test Performance Cleaning Part of the importance of chemistry is it explains how cleaning works.
