'As you can imagine, everyone didn't stay calm and got out very quickly. I was told by those working closely to the lab it was TATP.' TATP is a homemade explosive substance, and has been used in improvised explosive devices (IED). Traces of it was found after the 7/7 bombings, the November 2015 Paris attacks and last year's Brussels bombing. A spokesman for Bristol University would not confirm the nature of the substance, saying a review was set to start next week. But he confirmed the 'unstable substance' was made accidentally. He said: 'Our chemistry building and those buildings in the near vicinity were evacuated earlier this afternoon as a precaution, due to an unstable substance being manufactured by mistake. 'The substance has been disposed of safely and no one was injured. 'We will be looking into what happened and seeing what lessons can be learned.'
