Scotland have just their second ever win on the opening weekend thanks to two late Greig Laidlaw penalties after the hosts produced a breathtaking first half and withstood a colossal Ireland fightback to prevail.\nTrailing 21-8 at the interval, Ireland blasted their way back into lead with tries from Iain Henderson and Paddy Jackson, whose conversion had edged the visitors a point in front with 18 minutes to go. Scotland have had enough of near misses however. After another one against Australia in the autumn, they refused to buckle here. Their heroes were plentiful - Hamish Watson was monumental before he went off injured while Stuart Hogg lit up a first half performance for the ages and Jonny Gray would still be out there tackling tomorrow if he was asked.\nScottish optimism has been flowing for the last couple of weeks though the problem is, it often does in early February and it rarely is justified. They have been compared to the 1999 side that won the last ever Five Nations and their first half an hour is the closest they have come to emulating their predecessors in the years since. Ireland on the other hand, without Johnny Sexton but an imperiousness that comes with beating New Zealand in the autumn, began dreadfully but hit back with a response that appeared to prove why they are so many observers favourites for the title. Laidlaw had the final say however, to thrust Scotland firmly into contention for a first title since 1999.\nScotland, despite their early struggles at the scrum, took less than 10 minutes to capitalise on Ireland’s inability to deal with their commitment to putting width on the ball at every opportunity. The forwards rumbled up to the line towards the left before Finn Russell flung a pass towards Hogg on the right. It did not reach him but Garry Ringrose flew out of the line and slipped just as the ball bounced past him. He might not have caught Hogg anyway but it was unfortunate for the Irish youngster on his first Six Nations appearance.\nHogg’s tail was clearly up and when that is the case there are not many better full-backs around. He soared to claim a towering Conor Murray box-kick and just after the 20-minute mark had his second try. Scotland worked the ball to Huw Jones who straightened and fed Hogg on the left. Sean Maitland was outside him to keep Rob Kearney honest and after a delicious dummy from Hogg, and a forlorn tackle from Keith Earls, he was over. The watching Warren Gatland will have enjoyed what he was seeing from the 2016 player of the championship, already making a considerable early claim for this year’s award.\nBut whereas Scotland survived a scare just after Hogg’s first try - twice Ireland kicked penalties to the corner but on both occasions the hosts held out - they were pegged back soon after his second. Jackson slipped a tackle down the middle and after a couple of phases, and with the referee Romain Poite playing advantage, Earls was freed on the left to dive over.\nJackson could not convert and having missed some crucial penalties when making his Ireland debut here as a callow 21-year-old in 2013, he will have been relieved to convert his first three points towards the end of the first half. Problem for Ireland was, Scotland had added their third try by that stage in a manner that demonstrated the confidence with which they were playing. Ross Ford, on far early than expected for Fraser Brown who had suffered a head injury, picked out Alex Dunbar in a lineout close to the Ireland line and the inside-centre ghosted between Iain Henderson and Rory Best to score. You could not help but appreciate the sheer temerity of trying such a move, although Andy Farrell, Ireland’s defence coach, is unlikely to have felt the same way.\nGreig Laidlaw nailed his third conversion from wide on the right and after Jackson’s penalty, Scotland took a 21-8 lead into the interval, but not before Hogg was denied a first-half hat-trick by a crunching hit from Kearney, and Simon Zebo had picked off an interception, only for Scotland to scramble and clear their lines. Breathless stuff.\nIreland needed a swift response after the restart, and sure enough they got it. Scotland’s redoubtable tackling had been heroic to this stage but while Jonny Gray denied Murray’s dive for the line, Henderson followed up and Ireland were back to within six after Jackson’s conversion. Scotland were then dealt a significant blow when Hamish Watson went off before play had restarted - the openside weighing in with 16 tackles in his 49 minutes on the pitch.\nScotland were riding their luck. Finn Russell, back on after a head injury assessment, grubbered straight into Murray’s legs and had Jamie Heaslip a yard more pace he was in under the posts. Minutes later Earls was denied his second try after Kearney’s foot was correctly ruled to be just in touch. Ireland though, thanks in no small part to the bullocking Sean O’Brien, had stirred from their first-half slumber, and Jackson had his cathartic score shortly after the hour mark after wriggling to the line off Murray’s pass. His conversion put Ireland a point ahead and by now, the visitors were relentless but Scotland dug in and Laidlaw kicked the points to ensure that the optimism will continue to grow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T00:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T18:38:31.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
