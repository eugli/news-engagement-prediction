You can see the results for yourself in the video above.\nRead More Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket to resume flying as cost of explosion revealed as quarter of a BILLION dollars https://www.instagram.com/p/BQspL7Qhv1v/embed The drone footage was just one of the recorded viewpoints of the landing. The Falcon 9 rocket also had cameras strapped to its body and on the ground near the landing pad.\nTouchdown came after the rocket had delivered supplies and science equipment to the astronauts aboard the ISS.\nThis was also SpaceX's first launch (and landing) from Launch Complex 39A - the site that hosted numerous Apollo launches as well as the final Shuttle mission in 2011.\nRead More Holidays on the moon will be possible in a DECADE - but a ticket will cost you £8000 It could pave the way for the private space company to begin using the launch pad more frequently in the future. Especially if they can continue to land and re-use rockets so successfully.\nMusk also used Instagram to post another video of the Falcon 9 coming back down to Earth.\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BQtNTk4Brqp/embed poll loading Will SpaceX get to Mars by 2018? 0+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO @DailyMirror Elon Musk SpaceX", "external_links": ["http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/718/4221396001_5339914341001_5339860285001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201701/1762/4221396001_5304723464001_5304675426001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BQtNTk4Brqp/embed", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201701/2795/4221396001_5283961287001_5283941747001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/2423/4221396001_5329611861001_5329596860001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/trinity-images/logos/mirror.png", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/3720/4221396001_5334275861001_5334265152001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=DailyMirror", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/538/4221396001_5339471570001_5339457860001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/2302/4221396001_5339559502001_5339536275001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/582/4221396001_5339534803001_5339513020001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/1878/4221396001_5339718225001_5339717098001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/2838/4221396001_5339547993001_5339529670001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BQspL7Qhv1v/embed", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/2682/4221396001_5339820055001_5339820208001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/1426/4221396001_5339933131001_5339894197001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001"], "published": "2017-02-28T01:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:58:53.846+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
