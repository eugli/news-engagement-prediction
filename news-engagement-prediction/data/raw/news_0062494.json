RNZ \nFive people with gunshot wounds have had surgery after a shooting in Whangarei last night. Lois Williams is at the scene and says it is a quiet family street and the house in question is a rental property with what neighbours describe as a lot of \"comings and goings\" \nOne described it as \"a bit of row\" and said he heard car doors opening and shutting and cars taking off up the road. \nAnother said he heard \"a guy yelling and whimpering\". \nA third said there was a banging noise and people were wandering up and down the street. \nThe residents said a \"commotion\" went on for several hours on Wednesday evening. \nThey didn't hear any distinguishable gun shots. \n\"I thought maybe they were having a scrap,\" said another resident. \nClark Rd is a quiet Kamo street, home to many older residents, and not far from local schools. \nResidents have called police in the past, as people associated with the house have been \"hooning\" up and down the road. \nOne Clark Rd resident said there was frequently excessive noise from the rented property. \n\"There are lots of comings and goings.\" \nResidents didn't seeing any ambulances arrive at the property, but did see a taxi. \nOne resident said she had not seen any gang insignia at the property recently, but had seen some there before Christmas. \nA worker at a nearby Mobil station said locals had said there was fighting in the area, and people shooting from cars. \nSURGERY FOR VICTIMS \nAll five victims suffered serious gun-related injuries, and were taken to Whangarei Hospital. \nThree of them had surgery overnight, while another was awaiting surgery. \nThe fifth person was flown to Auckland Hospital and was undergoing surgery there. \nWhangarei mayor Sheryl Mai said she was dismayed to hear the \"terrible news\". \n\"We feel for the families, friends and community of the people caught up in this,\" she said. \nIt is not yet clear whether the shootings were the work of a lone gunman. \nA police spokesperson said police could not say whether a gunman was still on the loose, and could not guarantee there was not further risk to public safety. \n\"Obviously we can't make that kind of guarantee,\" she said. \n\"Police are investigating the incident and are already speaking with people involved,\" said Detective Senior Sergeant Dene Begbie. \n\"A scene guard has been in place overnight and an examination will be carried out today.\" \nWhangarei has seen a spate of shootings recently that have involved gang members. \nJohn Henry Harris, 37, known as John Boy, died on October 18 last year from a gunshot wound to his chest. \nHe was dropped off in a critical condition on the doorstep of a local ambulance station. \nPolice later released pictures of gang members taken moments before the shooting in an attempt to find who killed him. \nThere have been growing concerns about an increase in gang violence which seems to be linked to the nationwide meth market. \nAnyone who may have seen anything in the area of the Wednesday night shooting is asked to contact Whangarei police on 09 430 4500. \nAlternatively, they can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:26:23.397+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
