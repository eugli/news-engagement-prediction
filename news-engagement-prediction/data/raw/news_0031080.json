Almost £2million was squandered on deportation flights for failed asylum seekers that had to be cancelled because of a court ruling. Stock image of a deportation flight Officials booked seats before legal challenges were launched against deportation, meaning the operation had to be abandoned. Taxpayers have now forked out £5.2million on scrapped flights in three years. X-ray equipment worth almost £1million that was intended to screen passengers for TB at Gatwick and Heathrow was axed after a change in Government policy. Government documents state that the ‘machines have been declared redundant’ along with the ‘associated maintenance contracts’. After spending the money, officials decided to screen for diseases such as TB before passengers began their journey to the UK. Former justice minister Andrew Selous admitted that a £4.8million scheme to build colleges for young offenders was scrapped Around £2million went up in smoke when the Department for Farming and Rural Affairs scrapped a computer system that was being developed to help process payments under the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy. The department wanted to make farmers fill in their payment forms online. But it reverted to paper because farmers struggled with poor broadband coverage in rural areas. Documents seen by the Mail show that a plan to build secure colleges for young offenders was scrapped by the Ministry of Justice after officials had forked out £4.8million. Former justice minister Andrew Selous admitted that all work on a pilot scheme in Leicestershire with room for 300 children aged from 12 to 17 had been abandoned. Figures showed that around £4million had been ploughed into design fees and site preparation, and the rest on staff pay, procurement and other costs. An administrative error at the British Library meant the Department for Culture, Media and Sport overpaid £264,115 to authors when their books were loaned. John O’Connell of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘If we are ever going to balance the books then it is essential that a culture of delivering best value for money exists at all levels of the public sector. ‘It doesn’t matter if that is at the biggest departments in Whitehall or the smallest parish council, those in charge of holding the purse strings need to be acting more responsibly with taxpayers’ money. An administrative error at the British Library meant the Department for Culture, Media and Sport overpaid £264,115 to authors when their books were loaned ‘That means cutting out wasteful spending, clamping down on spurious compensation claims or recovering money that they are owed. ‘Some of these losses may be unavoidable but for too long we have seen too much taxpayers’ money frittered away as if it grows on trees. ‘It is important that Government officials now lead by example by making sure they cut out waste from the system, making government more efficient and delivering value for hard-pressed taxpayers.’ A Government spokesman said: ‘During the last financial year this Government has saved the taxpayer £3.3billion by disposing surplus property and reforming the way we work. ‘And we are on track to deliver our manifesto commitment of £15-20billion savings by the end of the parliament.’ Share or comment on this article 15", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T07:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T07:18:28.109+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
