There wasn't a whole lot of contact, to be honest. Jimmy Butler (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 11:35 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 11:35 p.m. ET \nJimmy Butler says he was fouled by Marcus Smart on what turned out to be the deciding play in Thursday's game between the Celtics and Bulls . \nButler is, technically, correct, but that was one really iffy foul call, especially given the point of the game in which it was called. And because, maybe, Butler talked his way into it. \nALL-STAR GAME: Rosters, how to watch \nSmart appeared to graze Butler's shooting elbow as Butler attempted a game-winning jumper in the final second of regulation. The shot missed as time ran out, but Smart was called for a shooting foul. A foul with that little contact usually isn't called in that situation. Replay Review (Foster): if Smart committed a foul before time expired, Q4 of #BOSatCHI . Ruling: Foul committed by Smart with 0.9 remaining. pic.twitter.com/IVhYoPCm4R â€” NBA Official (@NBAOfficial) February 17, 2017 \nOfficials put nine-tenths of a second back on the clock. Butler made both free throws to give the Bulls a 104-103 lead. Chicago then held on for the win. \n\"We all know (Smart is) an aggressive defender,\" Butler told TNT after the game. \"Got a piece of the elbow, go to the line, make two.\" \nMORE: Ranking every player in the NBA All-Star Game \nThat was one small piece. \nThe Celtics, naturally, were dumbfounded by the call. All-Star guard Isaiah Thomas was clearly angry after the final horn. \nSmart told reporters after the game ( via MassLive.com ) that Butler lobbied for a call after no whistle was blown immediately. \n\"Jimmy shot the ball. I heard him scream, \"NO FOUL?!\" As soon as he said that, the whistle blew and I looked, and I saw (official Zach Zarba) him raise his hand up. Foul. I couldn't believe it.\" \n\"I got punished for playing good D, I guess,\" Smart added. \nSo, is this call proof Butler has been, or will be, receiving star treatment from officials? Sure looks that way. The NBA's last-two-minutes report on this game might give us a bigger clue.
