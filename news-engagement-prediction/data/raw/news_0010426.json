(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) ORG XMIT: NFL196 (Photo: AP) \nAmong the positively crazy things about the New England Patriots' epic comeback effort in Super Bowl 51 is a quirky fact about running back Dion Lewis. \nAfter the championship win in Houston, the Patriots have claimed victory in every single game when Lewis was in the lineup. That's right, he's notched 10 wins in 2016 including the Super Bowl and seven in 2015. The Patriots are still undefeated every time Dion Lewis plays. â€” Jamey Eisenberg (@JameyEisenberg) February 6, 2017 \nLewis missed a bunch of contests between those two years thanks to a torn ACL and recovery from subsequent surgery, which means the Pats have lost a few contests without him. \nJust imagine what that must be like for Lewis - when in uniform, he's been a a part of a winning locker room every single time. That's just plain nuts.
