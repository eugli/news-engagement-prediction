Gossip Cop can bust this claim. We’re told it’s “not true.” \n“Gaga Goo-Goo For Kinney – Again!” blares a headline in this week’s National Enquirer , which goes on to claim the singer is secretly dating Kinney again after the pair ended their relationship last August. A so-called “source” tells the tabloid, “Gaga and Taylor are still seeing each other low-key right now, and Taylor did, in fact, go with her to the Super Bowl in Texas.”“Now that her career is back on track, it is just a matter of time before they go public with their relationship again,” adds the magazine’s seemingly made-up tipster. { \"position1\" : { \"type\" : \"artist\", \"id\" : 39335, \"name\" : \"Lady Gaga\" } } \nGossip Cop , however, already debunked this regurgitated article when RadarOnline published the same incorrect claim only days ago. The notoriously unreliable outlet falsely alleged Lady Gaga and Taylor Kinney were back together , but the singer’s own rep exclusively assured us the report was “definitely wrong.” While it’s true Kinney watched her perform at this year’s Super Bowl, the pair are not romantically involved anymore. It’s simply yet another fake news story. \nOf course, the Enquirer has a long history of publishing inaccurate reports about Lady Gaga. For example, Gossip Cop previously called out the tabloid for wrongly claiming Lady Gaga was caught in a three-way with Kinney and a “Chicago Fire” actress. That article was not true, and the same goes for this latest fabrication. \nPhoto: Getty Images ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T02:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T02:34:44.352+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
