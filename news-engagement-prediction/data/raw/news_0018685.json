A new study has found that women drinking water from plastic bottles during their pregnancy increases the risk of baby being obese. \nResearchers also found that the chemical bisphenol A (BPA), a hormone disruptor, is linked to an unborn child`s increased risk of obesity. \nWhen the child is exposed to BPA, they become less sensitive to a hormone responsible for controlling appetite. \nAs per study, experts admit they are not surprised by the results, and warned of the need to be aware of environmental factors that can lead to increased susceptibility of obesity. \nBPA is a chemical found in a variety of food containers, including polycarbonate plastic water bottles and can linings.

The hormone sends signals to the hypothalamus region of the brain to suppress appetite. \nSenior author Dr Alfonso Abizaid, of the Department of Neuroscience at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada said: `Our findings show that bisphenol A can promote obesity in mice by altering the hypothalamic circuits in the brain that regulate feeding behavior and energy balance.`Low level prenatal exposure to BPA delays a surge of leptin after birth that allows mice to develop the proper response to the hormone. BPA exposure permanently alters the neurobiology in the affected mice, making them prone to obesity as adults.` \nTo examine how BPA can encourage the development of obesity, the researchers fed pregnant mice BPA in their food. \nThe mice were exposed to doses of BPA that are lower than levels deemed safe by the US Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada. \nOnce the mice gave birth, the researchers gave their offspring injections of leptin at various intervals and then examined their brain tissue and analyzed their blood to gauge the response to the hormone. \nOther pregnant mice were not exposed to any chemicals or were exposed to an estrogen chemical called diethylstilbestrol (DES), so their young could be compared to those born to mice that were exposed to BPA. \nNewborn mice typically exhibit a surge of leptin when they are eight days old that programs a part of the brain to respond to fullness cues. \nThe findings found that animals exposed to BPA experienced this surge two days late, and mice exposed to DES never had a surge of leptin. \nWhen they were treated with leptin over the course of two days, control animals that weren`t exposed to either chemical lost more weight than BPA - or DES- exposed mice. \n`This study improves our understanding of how BPA can disrupt the endocrine system in a manner that raises the risk of obesity in animals,` Dr Abizaid said. \n`Since BPA has also been linked to obesity in humans, people need to be aware that environmental factors can lead to increased susceptibility to obesity and cardio-metabolic disorders.` \nA report released in October 2016 claimed that plastic bottles contain hormone-disrupting chemicals that can cause cancer, diabetes, ADHD and autism. \nYet they are found in thousands of everyday products, ranging from plastic and metal food containers, to detergents, flame retardants, toys and cosmetics. \nThese chemicals are responsible for scores of illnesses - costing the US an astonishing $340 billion in health-related costs each year, the NYU Langone report read.The most common illness due to endocrine disrupting chemicals is neurological - including attention-ADHD, autism and loss of IQ. \n(With ANI inputs) First Published: Wednesday, February 8, 2017 - 21:00 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:28:08.659+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
