Photo: Mayu Kanamori \nIt wanted to stop Domain using any phrases claiming it was the \"#1 property app in Australia\" or that its website or app had the most property listings in Sydney or the best property listings in Melbourne. \nSeven ads were identified, including a four-page wrap around of the Sydney Morning Herald that stated Domain was the \"#1 property app\" and had the \"most listings in Sydney\". A billboard also claimed Domain had the most listings in the Sydney real estate market. A similar wrap-around published in The Age that weekend said Domain had \"the best listings\" in Melbourne. \nJustice Murphy found the ads claiming Domain had the most listings in Sydney \"constitutes misleading or deceptive conduct\" in breach of Australian Consumer Law [ACL]. \n\"I also find that in representing that the Domain app is the number one property app in Australia because it allows users to view the most property listings in Sydney Domain made false or misleading representation that its service was of a particular standard, quality or grade, in breach of...the ACL,\" Justice Murphy added. \nThe court appointed a forensic accountant from KordaMentha to count the number of listings on Domain and realestate.com.au. He found that between September 2015 and February 2016 REA Group's site had more listings overall in greater Sydney than Domain, although the difference was not very large. \nAlso, a footnote in the print version of the advertisement clarifying Domain's count was based on established homes only was too small and too hard to find. If the footnote had been bigger this ad would not have been misleading, he noted. \nJustice Murphy found the claim of having the \"best listings\" in Melbourne was not misleading because \"the ordinary or reasonable reader would have understood the Best Listings Claim to be just puffery\". \nHe found real estate agents and property hunters would consider this claim to be \"just Domain's broad self-serving commendation of its own app over those of its competitors\". \nJustice Murphy also found three more advertisements published after REA filed its first injunction were not misleading. \nThese ads stated Domain was \"Australia's highest-rated property app\" and included a prominent asterix explaining this claim was based on app store ratings. \n\"I see it as quite unlikely that the ordinary or reasonable member of either target class would reach the view that there was some unidentified independent body which rated property apps against some unknown criteria. It is uncontroversial that no such body exists, and I am not satisfied that the ordinary reader would think that it did,\" Justice Murphy wrote, adding app users know ratings are written by other consumers. \n\"Based on the All Versions Ratings it is plain that the Domain app had a clear ascendancy over the REA app for a significant period preceeding the Advertisements\". \nBoth parties must submit draft orders within two weeks and costs are yet to be determined. \nFairfax Media's group general counsel Gail Hambly said: \"We are pleased that the judge found for us on the majority of points.\" \nChief executive of REA Group, Tracey Fellows, said the judgement was a good outcome and justified legal action. \n\"Our aim in taking this action was to ensure customers and consumers are able to make informed decisions based on reliable facts,\" Ms Fellows said. \n\"We are one step closer to keeping our competitor honest and accountable to provide reliable and fact based information.\" Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T12:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T07:31:45.249+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
