Read More \nThe man’s pockets were empty save from a one-way bus ticket from Leigh to Wigan, dated January 14 2013 and timed at 6.38am. \nThis tiny slip of paper could hold a clue as to his last ever journey. \nThe case has echoes of the David Lytton mystery. His body, carrying train tickets and cash, was found at Dovestones in 2015 but remained unidentified until this year. \nAgain, the investigation has spanned both the country and the globe, but appeals for information including stories in the M.E.N, have brought police no closer to the truth. Westwood Lane, near Westwood Cemetery - close to where the man's body was found \nNobody fitting his description has ever been reported missing, and detectives have failed to find a match for his fingerprints or DNA on any UK database. \nThe man found in Wigan is described as white, around 5ft 8ft-tall, with an olive-skinned complexion and short cut brown hair. Read More Who is this man filmed running across a field with bags of cash? \nDetectives say his appearance suggests he may be of Eastern European or Middle Eastern origin. \nWhen discovered, he was wearing blue Nike tracksuit bottoms, a blue padded gillet, a McKenzie hooded blue top with grey cuffs, a light blue Fred Perry T-shirt and blue Adidas trainers. \nDet Sgt Graham Clare, of GMP’s Wigan Borough, said: “Unfortunately, our extensive enquiries so far have not provided the results we hoped for and more than four years later this remains a mystery. \n“However, I still find it hard to believe that no one has any knowledge which could help us establish his identity and we remain hopeful that someone has the answers. David Lytton, the mystery man at Ealing Broadway station in London who has been identified after he was found dead on an Oldham hillside \n“Advances in social media technology and user numbers since 2013 mean that sharing appeals online is becoming an increasingly effective means of spreading a message. \n“So I am urging anyone who sees this to please take a moment to read it and, if possible, share it for others to see. \n“Despite the time that’s passed, it remains our priority to trace his next of kin and inform them of his death.” \nCoun Nathan Murray of Bryn ward on Wigan Council said he had followed the case with interest and praised GMP for their extensive national enquiries. \nHe added: “I find it such a shame that his identity has never been established. \n“However, with the passage of time, it’s only natural that this case may have slipped out of the public consciousness and we owe it to this man to renew the appeal to establish who he was. \n“I would urge anyone who believes they have any information, no matter how small it might be, to get in touch with the police so he can be given the dignity of being remembered by name, and not just as an anonymous person.” \nAnyone who can help identify the man is asked to call police on 0161 856 7962, or Crimestoppers anonymously 0800 555111.
