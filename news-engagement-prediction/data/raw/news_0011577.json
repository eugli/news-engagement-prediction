DJUBO is the only hotel tech company in India which has entered into such a partnership with Google, the company added. Google will be giving a high visibility to DJUBO's client hotels in exchange for a commission for Google on successful bookings. \n\nSo far, Google was only entering into cost-per-click partnerships with other hotel tech companies which required hotels or their tech partners to pay Google for every click that lands visitors on the hotel's booking engine. \n\nAll clients of DJUBO will get immediate visibility for their direct booking engine across all Google platforms like Google Hotels, Google Maps, Google Business Listing etc and will be charged a commission only when a booking happens. Google will use their unique algorithms and artificial intelligence tools to handle the bidding. \n\nSankalp Goel, co-founder and director, DJUBO said: \"One of DJUBO's goals is to increase direct bookings for hotels at lower than OTA commission rates. Traditionally direct booking platforms for hotels like brand websites, booking engines and enquiry CRM tools contribute to 1% of bookings in India which DJUBO has been able to pull close to 7% already through on page SEO, price comparison widget, mobile friendly website templates and other partnerships. With the launch of Fireball we are hoping to increase the penetration of direct bookings further.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T00:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T14:17:38.113+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
