At a conference on health care in Florida on Thursday, the former Speaker of the House said he doesn’t think Republican legislators will actually be able to repeal the Affordable Care Act and move the replacement through Congress. In fact, he predicted that Obamacare won’t be completely different when Republicans are done with it, Politico reports. “[Congressional Republicans are] going to fix Obamacare – I shouldn’t call it repeal-and-replace, because it’s not going to happen,”Boehner said, according to Politico. “Most of the framework of the Affordable Care Act … that’s going to be there.” He seemed to attribute the unlikelihood of repealing ACA to a lack of consensus to the right side of the aisle. “I started laughing,” Boehner said, referring to when Republicans had promised right after the November election to strike down Obamacare and quickly replace it, Politico reports. “Republicans never ever agree on health care.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:11:02.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
