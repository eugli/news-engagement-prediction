Share on Twitter Print This Post \nOutspoken transgender Republican Caitlyn Jenner ripped into Donald Trump’s recent move to ax protections for transgender Americans in a Twitter video on Thursday, calling the president’s decision a “disaster” and urging Trump to give her a call. \n“From one Republican to another, this is a disaster,” said Jenner. “You can still fix it. You made a promise to protect the LGBTQ community. Call me.” \nVideo: Well @realDonaldTrump , from one Republican to another, this is a disaster. You made a promise to protect the LGBTQ community. Call me. pic.twitter.com/XwYe0LNUOq \n— Caitlyn Jenner (@Caitlyn_Jenner) February 24, 2017 \nShe added: “Mr. President, we’ll see you in court.” \nJenner also went after “the bullies,” including new U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions. \n“Now, I have a message for the bullies: You’re sick,” she said. “Apparently, even becoming the attorney general isn’t enough to cure some people of their insecurities.” \nJenner’s harsh criticism comes less than a year after she praised Trump for his stance on LGBTQ issues. \n“He seems very much behind the LGBT community because of what happened in North Carolina with the bathroom issue,” she said last June, according to the Huffington Post. “He backed the LGBT community.” \nOf course, what Jenner didn’t seem to realize at the time – though most of us have known this for a while – is that verbal promises are meaningless to this president. Trump says whatever it takes to please the room he’s currently standing in. \nIn an administration full of anti-LGBTQ extremists, there was never a chance that he would keep his phony promises to support the transgender community. \nThough Jenner went hard after the new administration, she offered some words of hope for “the trans kids of America.” \n“You’re winning. I know it doesn’t feel like it today, or every day, but you’re winning,” she said. “Very soon we will win full freedom nationwide and it’s going to be with bipartisan support.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T09:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T05:07:18.416+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
