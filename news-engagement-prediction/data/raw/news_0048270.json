Maintenance staff used the Midtown Plaza’s ventilation system to remove the smoke. \nCustomers were not let back in and owners closed their stores for the remainder of the day. \nMD Ambulance paramedics assessed one of the mall’s security staff for smoke inhalation. \nNo one was found during a search of the parking garage. \nA fire investigator was called to the scene and determined the blaze originated from the driver-side engine compartment. Due to a “complete burn,” the cause is undetermined. \nDamage to the car and parkade ceiling finish is estimated at $10,000. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
