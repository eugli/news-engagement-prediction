PHOTO | HOTEL By ANGELA OKETCH \nOrdinary Kenyans have an opportunity to enjoy a Valentine accommodation at the luxurious Acacia hotel in Kisumu for only Sh93. \nThe offer, according to the hotel management, would be given to a couple that writes a compelling love poem titled “ 93 reasons to love ”. \nThe hotel, which ordinarily attracts both the lowly and the high and mighty has planned the spectacular Valentine’s Day competition that will see a lucky couple win a chance to dine at Kisumu’s most luxurious hotel come February 14. \nIf you have been having the passion to spend at the hotel and cannot afford, you have a reason to smile. \n“We thought of including people who are motivated to spend at Acacia and cannot afford it,” said Mr Robinson Anyal, the hotel’s sales and marketing manager said on Wednesday. \nPRESIDENTIAL SUITE \nLast year, the hotel had a valentine offer of Sh500,000 for a couple to spend in its presidential suite. \nThe package included a treat in the Jacuzzi, a luxury diamond and sapphire jewellery, all collectively rated at Sh1 million but none of the common mwananchi participated. \nHowever, in the latest competition, the everyone, regardless of their financial or social status can participate. \nIn normal circumstances, without the offer, the entire package offered to the couples would cost them Sh50,000. \n“With the Sh93, we are targeting boda bodas, mama mbogas to come and celebrate with their loved ones,” said Mr Anyal. \nThe only thing that the competitors need to do is to write a compelling love poem on “93 reason to love” and share it on the hotel’s Facebook page. \n“Once you like our page, you can easily post the poem. We are looking for a romantically-appealing poem that fits the theme. Creativity is a plus,” said Mr Anyal. \nThe lucky winners will enjoy treats including a night for two in Acacia’s Superior Room which overlooks the splendid Winam Gulf of Lake Victoria; breakfast, a bouquet of roses, a bottle of wine, an hour-long romantic boat ride on the lake.
