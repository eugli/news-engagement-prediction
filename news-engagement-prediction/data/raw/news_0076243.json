Subsequently, the story was picked up globally, and continues globally, to overwhelm my appearance at the Oscars, on the occasion of my record-breaking 20th nomination, and to eclipse this honor in the eyes of the media, my colleagues and the audience.” Meryl Streep: The Oscar Winner Through the Years \nOn Friday, February 24, Women’s Wear Daily ran a story in which Lagerfeld, Chanel’s creative director, claimed that Streep had dropped the fashion house in favor of another brand that would pay her to wear its design. \n“I made a sketch, and we started to make the dress,” the 83-year-old German designer told the publication. He said he received a phone call a few days later from someone in Streep’s camp. “‘Don’t continue the dress. We found someone who will pay us,’” he claimed the messenger said. \nLagerfeld also offered his thoughts on the alleged snub, calling the Florence Foster Jenkins star “a genius actress, but cheapness also, no?” \nAt the time, a rep for Streep denied Lagerfeld’s claim in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter , saying that the designer’s accusation was absolutely false, and that it is “against her personal ethics” to be paid to wear a gown to any red carpet event. The Biggest Celeb Feuds of All Time: Chloe, Kim, Kanye \nLagerfeld then issued an apology to Streep on Saturday morning, explaining that he “misunderstood” the situation. “Chanel engaged in conversations with Ms. Streep’s stylist, on her request, to design a dress for her to wear to the Academy Awards,” he said in the statement. “After an informal conversation, I misunderstood that Ms. Streep may have chosen another designer due to remuneration, which Ms. Streep’s team has confirmed is not the case. I regret this controversy and wish Ms. Streep well with her 20th Academy Award nomination.” Meryl Streep attends the TimesTalks Presents Meryl Streep Discussing Her New Film 'Florence Foster Jenkins' at The Times Center on August 11, 2016 in New York City; Karl Lagerfeld on November 30, 2016 in Paris, France.
