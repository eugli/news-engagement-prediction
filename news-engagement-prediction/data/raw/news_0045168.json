They say it’s a dangerous trend for the country.\nThe gathering is scheduled for Sunday at noon at Copley Square.\nActivists say they’re increasingly concerned after what they describe as “anti-science forces and climate deniers” have taken office. They say science should play an integral role in the country’s policy-making.\nThe rally coincides with the annual conference of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Boston.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T09:46:27.734+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
