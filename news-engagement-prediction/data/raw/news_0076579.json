Her father then approached the police and lodged a complaint against them. \nThe Delhi Police arrested two senior female students of the same school for assaulting the minor. A case under IPC sections 328 and 34 and the POCSO Act has been registered against the accused. \nThe girl alleged her seniors, who are in classes VIII and IX, took her into empty classrooms during lunch breaks or when her classes ended and made her perform obscene acts. \n\"One of the accused is class IX student and is 19-year-old. She had failed several times and so remained in the same class,\" a police official told Zee News. \n\"The girls would make the victim take off her clothes and do obscene things to them. When she would refuse, they would threaten to harm her,\" he added. \nThe victim was sent for medical examinationis and is being counselled by a local NGO to help ease her trauma.
