I think it’s our egoistic disorder.”\nThe Ghazi Attack is Om Puri’s first film that released after his demise. Kay Kay further says, “People with one tenth of his acting talent are being applauded and that’s because their PR machineries are strong. It’s just not fair.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T08:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:22:39.145+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
