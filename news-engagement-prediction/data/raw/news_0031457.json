Photo: Rick Bowmer/AP Republican congressman Jason Chaffetz is now claiming that the crowd of participants who confronted him at a town hall in his Utah district on Thursday night included a large contingent of paid agitators from out of state. Speaking with the Deseret News , the chairman of the House Oversight committee insisted, without offering any evidence, that the mostly-hostile capacity crowd’s reaction was “more of a paid attempt to bully and intimidate” him than an accurate reflection of what his constituents are truly concerned about. Furthermore, Chaffetz wrote off the protesters as Democrats who couldn’t come to terms with the election of President Trump and just want to lash out. “You could see it online a couple days before, a concerted effort in part to just cause chaos,” Chaffetz insisted. “Democrats are in disbelief that they have nothing but flailing and screaming to deal with this.”\n“Absolutely. I know there were,” Chaffetz said when pressed on his assertion that the town hall backlash was powered by paid disruptors. When asked who might have paid to fill out the 1,000-person audience, the Utah Republican then told the paper to “do some reporting.” Referring to the protesters’ frequent shouting, he added that, “We’re better than that. That’s not what the average Utahn is like.”\nThe crowd at the town hall. The event was held on Thursday night in Cottonwood Heights, a suburb of Salt Lake City. Photo: Rick Bowmer/AP There is no evidence that any of the protesters at the town hall on Wednesday were paid to be there, nor is there any evidence that the vast majority of them weren’t from Utah, as these reporters who were there attest:\nFWIW I spoke to around a dozen people for this story.

But this woman — Jane Hosking — was a Utah teacher for decades. https://t.co/oxjOG52kMW\n— Dan Diamond (@ddiamond) February 11, 2017 McCay Coppins, whose tweet is featured above, also pointed out in his Atlantic piece about the town hall that Democratic resistance to Trump isn’t the only thing Utah Republicans like Chaffetz should be worried about.\nDespite Utah’s status as one of the most conservative states in the country, Trump has never been very popular there. He carried the state’s electoral votes last year with just 45 percent of the vote. Up to now, Republican officeholders in the state have been largely insulated from their constituents’ opposition to the president—but some progressives in the state are hoping that will change. But Chaffetz, whose enthusiastic plan to spend four years investigating Hillary Clinton’s emails was spoiled by Trump’s victory on Election Day, also seems chafed at the idea that constituents might want him to make sure the president isn’t breaking any laws. “People are asking me to use the power of Congress to do a full-on fishing expedition to investigate him personally on things that are not required by law,” he told the Deseret News . “I think my doing that would be an abuse of power.”\nChaffetz has repeatedly shrugged off calls to use his Oversight Committee to conduct oversight of the president. And although he did criticize Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway last week for promoting a Trump-owned brand from the White House, he has also threatened to investigate the director of the Office of Government Ethics for criticizing the ethics of the president’s murky business ties.\nRegarding future town halls, Representative Chaffetz wants to try to find a new way to interact with voters without offering a venue “for these radicals to further intimidate.”\nTags: politics jason chaffetz protests Chaffetz Claims Town Hall Protesters Were Paid Outsiders Top Stories Richard Branson Helps Obama Cram 8 Years of Relaxation Into One Vacation NYC’s Bodega Rally Was a Testament to Solidarity and Patriotism 24 Hours at JFK: The Hour-by-Hour Account of Two Iraqis’ Detainment and Release Most Viewed Stories The Madness of King Donald Psychologists Think They Found the Purpose of Depression This Gym Owner Was Not Happy Ivanka Trump Took Her Class Unannounced A Brief History of ‘Cash Me Outside, Howbow Dah?’ ‘Cash Me Outside’ Teen to Dr. Phil: ‘I Made You Just Like How Oprah Made You’ Watching Donald Trump Try to Puzzle Out What ‘Asset Forfeiture’ Means Is Deeply Discomfiting Sears, Kmart Dump Ivanka Trump Products From Online Stores Republican Senator Admits GOP Health-Care Plan Has to Remain Secret Because It Will Be Unpopular First They Marched, Now More Than 13,000 Women Are Planning to Run for Office Rosie O’Donnell Won’t Be Playing Steve Bannon on SNL Most Popular Video On Daily Intelligencer The Statue of Liberty Was Originally Conceived as a Muslim Peasant Woman Latest News from Daily Intelligencer Yesterday at 8:13 p.m. Chaffetz Claims, Without Evidence, That Town Hall Protesters Were Paid Outsiders He also suggested that Democrats “have nothing but flailing and screaming” in response to the presidency of Donald Trump.\nYesterday at 2:16 p.m. Hundreds Arrested During Nationwide Surge of Immigration Raids Activists are worried that Trump’s widespread crackdown is now underway, but the government insists the raids are just business as usual.\n2/10/2017 at 6:31 p.m. Prosecutors May Purge Some Low-Level Warrants Dating Back Decades A new plan to respond to broken-windows tactics, according to a report in the New York Times .\n2/10/2017 at 6:22 p.m. White House Won’t Appeal Travel-Ban Case to Supreme Court But they may write a new, similar order, instead.
