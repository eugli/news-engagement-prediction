She does have wicked step sisters, played by men en pointe, and instead of singing birds and a fairy godmother, she visits her mother's crypt where ghosts dress her for the ballet.\"\nAnd, she whispered, Cinderella winds up Prince Charming's footmen.\nHow scandalous.\nThe ballet hosted its own fittingly unorthodox ball on Saturday evening. And while there were few tomboyish silhouettes – the affair was black-tie, after all – or men en pointe, several gala-goers certainly dressed the part of the ballet's title character.\nCELEBRATING: Medal of Arts winners mark philanthropy, talent\nAnne Chao , who co-chaired the \"Enchantment\"-themed soiree with husband Albert Chao , donned an avant-garde take on a shirt dress-slash-ball gown in Cinderella's signature blue hue; two sleeve-like pieces of fabric were knotted at the waist of her strapless frock. Carolyn Farb and Vivian Wise – the latter swan dramatically entered the fete not once, but twice, for maximum effect – shone in complementary sapphire shades while Kristy Bradshaw and Hallie Vanderhider opted for ethereal white. Bradshaw shared that her color-blocked Carolina Herrera had been hanging in her closet for more than a year for the perfect post-pregnancy invitation; the stunning young mother gave birth to a second son last summer. On Oscar Sunday, Disney starlet Sofia Carson attended the 89th annual Academy Awards in the exact Monique Lhuillier design that Vanderhider had twirled the night away in – and on the arm of Houston Ballet soloist Oliver Halkowich , no less.\nLithe ghosts in leotards and chiffon silently directed some 400 patrons from the Wortham Theater Center's red carpet entrance into Richard Flowers 's magical yet haunting lobby-turned-ballroom. City Kitchen's poached lobster and black truffle velouté and rack of lamb punctuated the ball's famously minimal program. Additional highlights included Ann Trammell 's recognition as honoree and the Party on the Moon-led disco, which was generously underwritten by longtime supporter Diane Lokey Farb .\nIn lieu of glass slippers, guests were given Wayfarers for the Top 40 dance party. There was only one scandal of note: two women chose identical Marchesa gowns for the occasion. The double-dose of chartreuse silk taffeta proved impossible to miss. Both handled the stylish fluke in stride, though; with more than $1.1 million raised, what's left to do but celebrate?", "external_links":
