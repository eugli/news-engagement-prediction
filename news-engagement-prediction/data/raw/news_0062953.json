After founding the program at Dowling, a Division II college on Long Island’s South Shore, in 2005, she had won 115 of 154 games. Now she was jobless. But her primary concern was still her players. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “I couldn’t help but think of them first,” Handras said. “My husband said, ‘We’ve got to figure out what’s best for you!’ But your heart breaks for them.” Among the first emails she received after the closing came from an address she did not immediately recognize. Gale Wasmus, a senior athletic administrator at New York Institute of Technology, another Division II institution about 40 minutes north, had an intriguing message. N.Y.I.T.’s former president, Edward Guiliano, had contemplated starting a women’s lacrosse program for years to complement its championship-winning men’s team. Maybe now was the time, and maybe Handras could be the first coach. The next day, Handras met with the athletic director, Duane Bailey, who offered a wild proposal. “What are the chances you can get your whole team over?” he asked. Photo N.Y.I.T’s women’s lacrosse team practicing this month with Coach Kerri Handras. A number of players followed Handras to N.Y.I.T. after Dowling College announced it was closing. Credit Christopher Gregory for The New York Times Handras was floored. She did not want to wait to speak to players individually, and she did not want to seem as if she were applying pressure. So she casually fired off the picture message to the entire group, guessing at least a few of her players might be interested. “I don’t even think we spoke about it, to be honest,” the senior attacker Karie Znaniecki said. “We just said, ‘We’re all coming.’” There were still plenty of logistical hurdles. A new coach bringing along a few transfers has become commonplace in collegiate athletics. But an entire roster? It is believed to be unprecedented. The closest parallel might be when a professional franchise relocates to a new city. Though a handful of players sought out other options, a total of 13 from Dowling’s final roster ultimately followed Handras. So did one player who had taken a year off, and two recruits who had committed to Dowling. Handras also brought along two of her assistant coaches. “It’s a pretty ambitious thing to absorb an entire team in one shot,” Bailey said. Bailey arranged for the players to take a tour of the campus before deciding if it was a fit for them. They all arrived together — players, coaches, parents, administrators, admissions personnel, academic support and compliance personnel — and traveled as a group. Many of the players were majoring in education, a program N.Y.I.T. does not offer, so they needed placement into compatible substitutes. For some, like Znaniecki, it will require an additional year to make up for credits lost in the transfer. But, she said, the ability to stick together as a team overwhelmed any concerns she had about adding an extra year.
