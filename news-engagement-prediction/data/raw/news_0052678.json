We support them as they do it to press for their demands,” Singh said, while addressing a press conference in Jammu. Representational image. AP \nSingh, 75, the patron of NPP, said that the demands of the youth were genuine and needed to be considered by the government. \"If anybody is fighting with stones against atrocities, we are with them,” Singh added. \nKashmir saw unrest after Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Burhan Wani was killed on 8 July in south Kashmir.His death sparked protests across the Valley in which close to 100 people, including 2 security personnel were killed and hundreds were injured. \nThe PDP-BJP government launched a massive crackdown against agitating leaders and stone pelters. Kashmir police arrested over 7,000 people in the Valley while more than 500 were booked under the Public Safety Act (PSA). \nSingh said that nearly “13000 youth”, mostly students, are currently languishing in different jails across India. “The jails across the state have no space left now. The arrested youth have been shifted to jails in other states,” he said. \nHe also sought forgiveness from the people of Kashmir, especially the parents whose kith and kin were either killed or blinded during last year’s unrest. “Despite the killing, blinding and maiming of Kashmir youth we were mute spectators. I knocked the doors of the Supreme Court over the killings in Kashmir but that didn't help,\" he said. \nPeoples Democratic Party General Secretary Nizamuddin Bhat said Singh’s statement would only encourage the youth to throw stones at forces. “Do you think such a statement should be made by a senior leader like him? It is most unfortunate,” Bhat said. \nThe National Panthers Party has also demanded that the Rohingya refugees leave Jammu. Recently, Singh's party erected dozens of hoardings in Jammu which told the refugees to leave the city or be thrown out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:37:06.274+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
