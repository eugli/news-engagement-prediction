He probably just wanted to get the hell out the door on a Friday.\nOr maybe he’s just got really bad handwriting.\nWhatever, the mysterious Brendan’s ultimate office hack is being celebrated and denigrated as the snap of his totally unsentimental stamp does the rounds of Instagram.\nWe’ve all been there: the office birthday card arrives on our desk, and we’re supposed to write a pointed message for the colleague we barely know.\nBrendan was clearly over it, so came up with a custom-made stamp so he can deliver on his office obligations with almost zero effort.\nThe post which brought us Brendan. Picture: Instagram/Andrea Blake Source: Instagram\nHe’s stamped out sentiment in favour of cool efficiency in the process.\nWe don’t know how to tell Brendan this, but he hasn’t got a mortgage on clever and callous call-outs of office niceties.\nWe have an acquaintance here at news.com.au who we will call Scott (because that’s his name) who came up with this idea years ago, as a sea of redundancies in his industry added to the office card clutter of birthdays and maternity leave.\nHis stamp, which Scott enthuses cost “only about six bucks” covered all eventualities.\n“Dear friend,” it reads. “My thoughts are with you on this occasion. Yours most sincerely, Scott.”\nHe even sprung for the stamp to feature his signature above his name.\nThe added bonus, Scott says, is that it weeds out those who don’t get his sense of humour.\nWe’ll award a smiley stamp for that.\nScott sprung for a signature for his “all occasions” stamp.
