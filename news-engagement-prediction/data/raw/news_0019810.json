Ryan Adam Morris (Photo: Maricopa County Sheriff's Office) \nA Phoenix man accused of starving his 9-month-old son was sentenced to 15 years in prison on Tuesday.\nRyan Adam Morris pleaded guilty in January to one count of child abuse and one count of attempted child abuse.\nMaricopa County Superior Court Judge Sherry Stephens sentenced Morris to 15 years in prison and supervised lifetime probation. Once released, he will not be able to contact his son or any minor under the age of 15 without written permission from his probation officer.\nWhen Stephens asked what Morris had to say, he responded, \"Just that I'm sorry your honor.\"\nHis girlfriend and the child's mother, Veronica Marie Diaz, received a similar sentence last month. She had also pleaded guilty to one count of child abuse and attempted child abuse in relation to this case.\nThe court received multiple letters written on Morris' behalf, including one from Diaz, that had asked for leniency.\nInfant was close to death Authorities said the infant was starved for almost three weeks before he became unresponsive and close to death. Morris took the baby to Phoenix Baptist Hospital in March 2014. It was suggested that the child had been neglected since he was born. Meanwhile, other children in the home appeared to be healthy.\nThe infant was nursed back to health and has since been adopted.\nAt the hearing Tuesday, prosecutor Marischa Gilla showed a photo taken from Diaz's phone on March 19, 2014, several days before the baby's admission into the hospital. It depicted Morris and the emaciated baby laying next to each other on a bed, Gilla said.\nVeronica Marie Diaz.   (Photo: Maricopa County Sheriff's Office) \nGilla argued that the poor condition of the child was evident and couldn't have been denied by Morris. His attorney asked for a shorter sentence of 10 years in jail because Morris brought the child to the hospital, but Gilla countered that he had only done so at the prompting of his boss.\nMorris had the same responsibilities as the mother and was in and out of the home, Gilla said. \"He had an absolute duty to care for his child,\" despite arguments from the defense that Morris had an \"intellectual-challenging condition,\" she said.\nMelinda Kevitt, an investigator with the Arizona Department of Child Safety, attended the sentencing but did not testify about the condition of the child. Krevitt requested for Morris to receive the maximum sentencing of 15 years, Gilla said.\nAt the trial for Diaz, Kevitt described the child as being \"hours to days from dying,\" and he was so dirty that the nurses were not able to wash off all of the dirt from his body. She also stated the infant had severe issues with swallowing because he had not developed the proper muscle control. He would keep his hands near his eyes and mouth to help him swallow by pushing fluid down his throat, Krevitt said.\n'He was always respectful and polite to staff' Morris' defense lawyer, Diane Allen, argued that both Morris and Diaz were not equipped to be parents. Morris and Diaz needed help with their son, but didn't know how to ask for it or where to look, Allen said\nMorris' parents were present during the sentencing. Morris has expressed nothing but remorse and regret that he did not act sooner to help the child and he would do things differently if given the chance, Allen said.\nWhile Allen read a portion of a letter written on Morris' behalf, he and his parents began to cry. \"He was always respectful and polite to staff,\" a co-worker wrote.\nIn January, Stephens had sentenced Diaz to 15 years in prison and lifetime parole. Once she is released, she will not be able to contact her son or any child under the age of 12.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T08:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T11:41:06.786+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
