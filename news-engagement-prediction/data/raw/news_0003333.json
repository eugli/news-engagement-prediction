Can Oscar favorite 'La La Land' (starring Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling) still dance away with best picture? (Photo: Dale Robinette, Lionsgate) \n2017 has already made its mark on Hollywood as one of the most politically charged years in recent memory, with a polarizing new president clashing with the increasingly vocal, overwhelmingly left-wing entertainment community. \nAt the same time, the film Hollywood has pushed to the front of the 2017 awards pack is the feel-good musical La La Land , which earned a record-tying 14 Oscar nominations last week, including for best picture. Even the film's title represents an escape from the troubling world as opposed to the realities depicted in the weightier stories that comprise the film’s main awards competition: the dramas Moonlight , Fences, Hidden Figures and Manchester by the Sea . \nLa La Land 's dominance is both a lightning rod for discussion and part of an unfolding drama over the role of escapist films in the early days of the Hollywood vs. President Trump era. \n\"It’s interesting that in this particularly contentious year we have La La Land as the overwhelming front-runner vs. films with more serious topics that reflect the human condition ... without song and dance,\" says Pete Hammond, awards columnist for the industry website Deadline.com. “There is that battle with people who think an Oscar winner, especially the top award, should be something weightier, that this year is not the time to go light. Others counter that this is exactly the time to honor something which provides an escape from the barrage of news that grows more intense every day.\" \nOne of the biggest threats to a 'La La Land' win: The more topical 'Moonlight' (with Alex Hibbert, foreground, and Mahershala Ali), an African-American coming-of-age tale about a gay youth growing up Miami. (Photo: A24) \nThe heated political temperature in Los Angeles as Trump begins his term raises the question of whether La La Land can stay on top until the Oscars are handed out Feb. 26. \n\"Hollywood has become even more politically defiant and is speaking with one voice, it's very clear,\" says Tom O'Neil, editor of awards website GoldDerby.com. \"This will affect how people are going to vote on their Oscar ballot. In a normal Oscar year, La La Land could skate to easy wins, but it could be impacted by the political climate.\" \nWhile there are no clearly political movies in the running that could directly benefit from the sentiment, most of the nine films vying for best picture present a starker, more realistic contrast to writer/director Damien Chazelle’s story of two artists (Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone) balancing love, life and the pursuits of their Hollywood dreams. Who'll win? Analyzing pros and cons of the Oscar best picture nominees \nWriter/director Barry Jenkins' Moonlight (with eight nominations) follows a gay African-American man overcoming struggles in a tough Miami neighborhood from childhood to adulthood. Manchester by the Sea (six nominations) features best actor nominee Casey Affleck's handyman Lee Chandler coping with his shattered life and devastating loss. \nFences is playwright August Wilson's portrayal of a black couple (Denzel Washington and Viola Davis, both nominated in the acting categories) dealing with the endemic racism of midcentury America. Hidden Figures celebrates the overlooked work of African-American female mathematicians (played by Taraji P. Henson, Janelle Monáe and Octavia Spencer) helping NASA put a man in orbit in the height of the Space Race. \nHell or High Water highlights brothers who rebel against foreclosure by robbing banks and the Texas Ranger who pursues them. Lion tells the true story of an adopted Indian child who grows up in Australia before seeking out his childhood home. \nRandi (Michelle Williams) and Lee (Casey Afleck) have a difficult time dealing with past tragedy in 'Manchester by the Sea.' (Photo: Claire Folger) \nWhile La La Land has been lauded for its originality and execution, the movie's lack of a social message is a sharp contrast to Hollywood's collective voice, which has grown louder with the celebrity bully pulpits of January's awards season coinciding with Trump taking power in Washington. A particularly seismic moment took place Jan. 8 at the Golden Globes, when Meryl Streep dedicated her acceptance speech for her lifetime achievement award to decrying Trump. \nTrump's Twitter response calling the iconic actress \"overrated\" only amplified the discussion and provided a push for Streep to earn an Oscar nomination for Florence Foster Jenkins (\"It certainly energized her voters and supporters,\" Hammond says). Why Meryl Streep isn’t overrated, by the numbers \nActors used their screen time at Sunday's Screen Actors Guild Awards to protest Trump's immigration ban, enacted by executive order two days before the awards. The political statements started on the red carpet ( Florence Foster Jenkins star Simon Helberg carried a \"Refugees Welcome\" sign) and continued through winners' defiant speeches onstage. \nAt arrivals, Lion 's Dev Patel reflected the growing political voice when he told USA TODAY the ban made him feel as if he had \"walked into a nightmare, but it's real. And it's happening right here.\" After Hidden Figures surprised by winning best ensemble cast (the SAG equivalent of best picture), Spencer said backstage how proud she was that the film \"makes a difference\" by representing \"people who were largely unrepresented.\" \nSpencer pointed out another factor that makes Hidden Figures an emerging Oscar force: The film is a certified hit (nearing $107 million at the box office) and even taps into audiences looking for escape with its uplifting ending. \n\"We need to provide a little escapism from the realities we are currently existing in,\" said Spencer. \"The fact the film is resonating at the box office shows that people are hearing the message.\" \nTaraji P. Henson stars as a woman who faces racial and gender inequality at 1960s NASA in 'Hidden Figures.' (Photo: Hopper Stone) \nDave Karger, special correspondent for IMDb.com, says the political mood and a timely Jan. 6 national release date has give Hidden Figures an awards boost. Moonlight has also risen in awards stature, he says, solidifying expectations that it will win adapted screenplay and best supporting actor for Mahershala Ali, who gave an impassioned speech against Trump's immigration ban while accepting his SAG Award. \nMeanwhile, top dog La La Land has suffered a backlash with its dominating nominations, which critics contend is out of step with the current climate. \n\"That backlash is very real right now — not enough to lose, but enough that some people will question, especially now, why Hollywood is seen congratulating itself,\" says Karger, who still sees the best picture race being between La la Land and Moonlight. \" Moonlight is the underdog with the political statement, and it can have a great Oscar night. The question is whether it can topple the film tied with the most nominations ever for best movie.\" 6 things you should know happened at the SAG Awards \nHistory and logic are still on La La Land 's side, says O'Neil. The two films previously nominated for 14 nominations, All About Eve and Titanic, went on to win best picture. Further, La La Land' s nominations throughout the ballot demonstrate overwhelming support in all voting branches of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. \nThe film also has a message, one that strikes true within the community, says O'Neil: \"It's a movie about Hollywood, the sacrifices you make to succeed in this town, including the greatest love of all. That message really hits home here.\" CLOSE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T05:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:00:16.673+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
