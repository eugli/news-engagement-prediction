She was 58 when she found her passion. \n“I can’t believe that I can be an athlete and win a medal at 58 years old,” she said back then. \nNow at 75, Sauer has won more than 50 medals. \n“Michael [Phelps] what does he have 12 or something?” she said with a smile. \nSauer with some of her medals CBS News \nShe’s also active outside of the pool.
