It did not provide further details. \nEarlier, the country’s Yonhap news agency reported in a short dispatch that the North had fired a ballistic missile. \nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un said in his New Year speech that the country was close to test-launching an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and state media have said such a launch could come at any time. \nThat prompted a vow of an “overwhelming” response from U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis when he traveled to South Korea earlier this month. \nNorth Korea has conducted two nuclear tests and a number of missile-related tests at an unprecedented rate since early last year and was seen by experts and officials to be making progress in its weapons capabilities. \n(Reporting by Jack Kim and Ju-min Park; Editing by Leslie Adler and Matthew Lewis) More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T07:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T02:49:11.674+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
