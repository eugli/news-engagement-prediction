Supporters of a bill to make Howard County a sanctuary for undocumented immigrants gathered by the Council votes on the legislation Monday evening. (Fatimah Waseem) \nTrump's immigration executive orders gave new life to the crowd of more than 500 and an already impassioned debate that drew impassioned testimony over the last several weeks. \nDemocratic elected officials addressed supporters in a rally before the vote. \nOakland Mills High School student Gavin Kohn organized the rally in support of the sanctuary designation, which he said he was pushing to create sanctuary policies in Howard County Public Schools days before Ball introduced the proposal. \n\"The opposition has been scary,\" Kohn said. \"We need to go farther to protect other people's rights, now more than ever.\" \nRegister of Wills Byron Macfarlane and other leaders said the label was an opportunity to show Howard County is a welcoming place for immigrants — undocumented or documented. \n\"It's time to lead,\" said Macfarlane. \nDel. Clarence Lam, a Democrat who supports the bill, lamented the Asian American community's support of the bill, which Lam said opponents were using to divide the immigrant community. \n\"There were members of my community who were divided,\" Lam said, adding that every day of a presidency under Trump was \"a new day of recklessness.\" Fatimah Waseem Supporters of a bill to make Howard County a sanctuary for undocumented immigrants gathered by the Council votes on the legislation Monday evening. Supporters of a bill to make Howard County a sanctuary for undocumented immigrants gathered by the Council votes on the legislation Monday evening. (Fatimah Waseem) \nIntroduced by Democratic council members Calvin Ball and Jen Terrasa, the bill would label Howard County as a sanctuary. Ball and Terrasa introduced the proposal as a direct response to Trump, who they say galvanized support for xenophobia, Islamophobia and racism and created a climate of fear for undocumented immigrants. \nThe bill largely codifies existing policies. \nHoward County police do not enforce federal immigration law, do not make inquiries into individual's citizenship status and treat undocumented immigrants the same as other individuals. \nHoward County Police Chief Gary Gardner is opposed to the label, which he said could compromise federal funding and limit information-sharing integral to ensuring community safety. \nHoward County Executive Allan Kittleman has vowed to veto the bill if it passes the council. The bill needs three votes to pass and four to override the veto. \nMore than 200 supporters converged in front of the county's main government offices holding handmade signs and sturdy \"Yes\" signs — a marked shift from public hearings where opponents with professional \"No\" signs took a vocal stake against the bill. \nBall also addressed the crowd at the rally before the vote. \n\"I'm used to taking a little bit of heat from red shirts,\" Ball said, referring to the opponents who identify themselves by wearing red. \nAddressing opponents' concerns the label would draw undocumented immigrants, Ball said the label of a sanctuary would make the county \"a beacon for light for justice and fairness and equality.\" \nThe council is scheduled to vote on the proposal at its 7 p.m. tonight.
