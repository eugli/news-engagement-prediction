Kumaraguru came up with the idea of designing a ‘golden chariot’ for a thaneer panthal (refreshment stall).\nThis is to commemorate the golden chariot which will make its maiden journey on the eve of Thaipusam.\nThe 61-year-old said the first thing that came to his mind when he was asked to do the artwork for the Om Muruga Thaneer Panthal at Jalan Utama on the island, was the golden chariot.\nTwo weeks ago, Kumaraguru got down to work and started collecting recycled materials.\nHe gathered newspapers, card boxes, polyfoam, rubber, plywood and others to design the three metre-high ‘chariot’.\nIt will adorn the entrance of the panthal during Thaipusam.\n\n“I spent about eight hours daily but now I am spending more hours to finish up the chariot,” he said when interviewed at his house in Seberang Jaya recently.\nKumaraguru, who has been doing artwork for the past 15 years for religious functions and temples, said he used recycled materials in line with the state government’s call to make the state a cleaner, greener and healthier place to live.\nHe also said that he was doing the artwork for the Om Muruga panthal for free.\n“It is enough that I receive Lord Muruga’s blessing,” he added.\nThe panthal committee treasurer K. Selvam @ Param, 53, thanked Kumaraguru for sacrificing his time to work on the ‘chariot’.\nSelvam said the committee had been putting up the panthal since 1974 and providing free food and drinks during Thaipusam festival.\nThis year is the first time Penang will see two chariot processions – the traditional silver and the new golden chariot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T03:51:27.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
