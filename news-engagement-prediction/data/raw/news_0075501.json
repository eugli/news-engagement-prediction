It will suprise no-one to see The Netherlands at the top of the table. The Dutch are well known for their lofty height. Other countries among the 10 tallest include Denmark, Norway, Germany and Croatia. Britain, whose men are 1.77m, on average, comes in at 26th. The world's 10 tallest countries Netherlands - 1.838m Slovenia - 1.803m Luxembourg - 1.799m \nGents from Bosnia and Herzegovina might feel aggrieved to be left off that list. According to some sources they are a fraction taller even than the Dutch. The www.averageheight.co , which collects data from a variety of sources and whose statistics we used for our map, adds that Nilotic peoples that live in regions near the Nile Valley, the African Great Lakes, and southwestern Ethiopia, and are regarded to be among the tallest people on earth with an average male height is 6ft 3in (1.9m). Ethiopia, however, doesn't appear on its table of tallest countries.
