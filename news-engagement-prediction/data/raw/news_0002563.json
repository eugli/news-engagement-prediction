Photo: Alex Ellinghausen \n\"Overseas events - as well as those here in Australia - have shown us that the Australian people must be confident that our electoral process is free from foreign intervention,\" he said. \n\"I believe Australians expect us to ensure that only Australians and Australian businesses can seek to influence Australian elections.\" \nThe Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters is currently examining the issue of donations. \nCurrent Commonwealth law does not distinguish between donors from Australia or overseas, or between Australian citizens, non-citizens or organisations. No other English-speaking democracy allows large foreign donations. \nThe issue became front-page news last year when Labor's Sam Dastyari was forced to quit the frontbench after it was revealed he had a Chinese-linked donor pay a bill for him. \nForeign donations in 2015-16 were down on previous years, according to the AEC data. \nLabor leader Bill Shorten repeated his call for a ban on foreign donations - as well as real-time reporting and other transparency measures - during his own speech to the Press Club on Tuesday. He said Mr Turnbull should have revealed the size of his own donation by now. \n\"Why hide behind a technicality? It's tricky, it's shifty â€“ the Prime Minister owes Australians a lot better than the bare minimum.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T10:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T05:11:37.600+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
