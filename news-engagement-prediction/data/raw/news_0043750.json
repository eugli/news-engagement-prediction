It's a difficult dynamic.\" \nThe former Queen of the Jungle says she doesn't worry about how other people view her, but about how things will affect her kids. \nShe said: \"A lot of people make you feel bad about having different children to different people. It doesn't seem that bad, but it's hard for people to digest and they think it's unfair on the kids.\" \nIt could mean that Stacey and Joe, who hosted I'm A Celeb spin-off Extra Camp together, may never have a child together. \nShe added: \"We talk about it. But briefly. Joe's got his boy and I've got mine. The boys love Joe. It's just doing what's right for the children rather than we we selfishly want.\" Stacey says her sons love Joe (Photo: Getty) Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:42:22.398+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
