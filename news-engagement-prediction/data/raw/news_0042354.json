Story continues below \nAdditional officers arrived at the scene and quickly located and arrested a suspect. \n“We are grateful that our officer was not injured during this incident,” Cpl. Jesse O’Donaghey said in a news release. “Kelowna RCMP would also like to commend their complainant for not only recognizing the potential hazard the erratic driver posed to other motorists on the highway, but also for immediately passing that information along to police.” \nMounties said the driver, a 21-year-old Alberta man, faces both driving prohibitions and fines under the BC Motor Vehicle Act as well as potential criminal charges. \nHe has been released from custody and is expected to appear at the Kelowna Law Courts on May 8, 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:24:54.533+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
