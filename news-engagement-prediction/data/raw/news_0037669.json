By: Express Web Desk | New Delhi | Updated: February 17, 2017 7:17 pm Rae Bareli: Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi waves at an election rally in UP. PTI Photo by Nand Kumar \nAddressing an election rally in Uttar Pradesh’s Rae Bareli, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday saying he makes empty promises, and never delivers. The Congress vice-president was also joined by sister and party leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in Rae Bareli for the first time this poll season, a parliamentary seat held by mother and party president Sonia Gandhi . Priyanka has been instrumental in cobbling together the Samajwadi Party and Congress alliance ahead of Assembly polls in the state. She is also one of the 40 star campaigners the Congress is relying on to improve its performance in India’s largest state. \nWATCH VIDEO | Rahul, Priyanka Address Joint Rally In Rae Bareli, Takes Jibe At PM Modi’s ‘Loan Waiver’ Promise \nSlamming the prime minister for his opportunism, Rahul said PM Modi thinks of farmers only during elections. He put out demands of farmers before the PM, when he said, “They want three things: Waive off farmers’ loans, slash electricity bill by half and give right price for produce,” said Gandhi. “PM Modi makes empty promises, why doesn’t he act?” asked the Congress leader. \nTaking on the BJP government, Rahul criticised the PM for not doing enough to waive off farmers’ loans. He said if PM Modi wants, then he can waive off loans in 15 minutes. “The BJP promised they’ll waive off farmers’ loans. Congress had waived Rs 70,000 crore of farmers’ loans when it was in Centre. If Modi wants, he can waive off loans in 15 minutes but no one does it. Modi had promised special packages to Bihar as well, but what happened?” asked Gandhi. \nREAD: Priyanka Gandhi takes on PM Modi in Rae Bareli: UP has its own youth, why does it need an ‘outsider’? \nWATCH VIDEO | This Is How Samajwadi Party Patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav Was Attacked on March 4, 1984 \nThe Congress vice-president also used Bollywood’s reference to hit out at the Modi government. He said, “Instead of Shah Rukh Khan’s Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge as “Achhe Din” – Modi’s poll chant – people get ‘Gabbar Singh’ from Sholay .” He also said that Modi had promised Varanasi of providing free internet, about cleaning up the city but he hasn’t delivered on his promises. “Relationships aren’t made this way, Modi ji,” added Rahul. He further asked media to show what has happened there. On demonetisation, Gandhi said it dealt a big blow to small businesses, small shopkeepers and farmers. \nPriyanka Gandhi also addressed the rally in Rae Bareli where she took a dig at PM Modi for his comment that he is “adopted son” of UP. She questioned why the state needs ‘adopted son’ when it has own sons. Priyanka said PM has done nothing for his constituency Varanasi, accuses him of making hollow promises. “PM had said UP has adopted him and that he will look after UP’s development. Does UP need to adopt anyone to look after its development?” Priyanka Gandhi said at the rally, adding: “Is there no youth here that can take UP forward? Each youth here has the potential to become a politician and work for the development of UP… every one has that hope.” \nWATCH VIDEO | Assembly Elections 2017: How Has UP Voted In The Past Explained \nWith two days to go for the third phase of elections in Uttar Pradesh, war of words continued between BJP, Congress-SP alliance and the BSP on Thursday. Leaders from all the major parties held rallies and press conferences to attack the opposition and woo the voters. Party’s workers have long been demanding that Priyanka campaign, but the Congress high command has clarified that she will restrict her campaign only to Amethi and Raebareli. In both these constituencies, Priyanka will campaign for the ten candidates of the Congress Party. It hasn’t yet been decided if she will also campaign for the Samajwadi Party candidates. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T23:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T06:12:27.122+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
