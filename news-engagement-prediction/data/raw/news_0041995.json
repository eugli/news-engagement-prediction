The chairman spoke to him this afternoon and Wayne offered his resignation. \n\"I'm devastated, the chairman is devastated. I have spoken to Wayne and the guy is in tears, crying down the phone. It is a very sad situation.\" \nThe news capped a surreal few hours in the history of the world's oldest cup competition. Infographic: Sun Bets, which sponsors Sutton United, offered odds on a Sutton player chomping on a pie during the match. \nShaw, who weighs 127kg, was caught on camera tucking into the pie minutes from the end of Monday's game against Sutton, who were trailing 2-0 having used their regulation three substitutes. \nThe keeper had featured on promotion materials during the non-league club's surprise FA Cup run after revealing that he played in the same youth team as former England striker Alan Shearer. \nShaw admitted knowing about the wager offered by Sun Bets, the online betting branch of The Sun newspaper whose logo also appeared on Sutton's shirts. \n\"I thought I would give them a bit of banter,\" he said. \"It was meat and potato.\" \nShaw denied he had placed a bet himself, but as his pie-eating antics made headlines in Britain and beyond it became clear the stunt had gone badly wrong.

(AP: Matt Dunham) \nOn Tuesday morning the Gambling Commission, the regulatory body that oversees British gambling, announced its inquiry. \n\"Integrity in sport is not a joke,\" said Richard Watson, enforcement and intelligence director at the Gambling Commission. \n\"We'll be looking into any irregularity in the betting market and establishing whether the operator has met its licence requirement to conduct its business with integrity.\" \nLater on Tuesday the FA announced its own investigation into the behaviour of Shaw. \n\"We are investigating to establish whether there has been any breach of The FA rules relating to betting,\" a spokesman said. \nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:40:00.443+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
