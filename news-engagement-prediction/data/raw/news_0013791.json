It’s exciting to know that we’re going to do more in the future.\"\nThe B.C. man hopes that he will be part of that future exploration. \nIn the next few weeks Cullen will undergo a series of physical, mental and social tests.\n\"I think it’s difficult to prepare outright for them and I think one just has to rely on one’s ability to react and to make the best decisions in different situations,\" he said. \"I’m excited to find out how I’ll respond to that kind of situation.\"\nA space systems engineer from Germany, a commercial pilot in Thunder Bay and a cardiothoracic surgeon from Ohio are three others in the running for the two spots . \nThe winners will be selected this summer and will be required to move to Houston, Texas in August.\n“I wouldn’t say I’m scared, I’m really excited when you look at the pool of applicants… they’re really talented, really accomplished, really dynamic individuals,” he said. “I’m excited to meet them.”\nPhotos Cullen is a professor of chemical oceanography at the University of Victoria.
