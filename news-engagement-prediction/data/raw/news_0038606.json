Puzder withdrew his nomination on Wednesday, after POLITICO published a video in which his former wife leveled abuse allegations against him while appearing on Oprah's show in disguise in 1990. She later recanted the accusations.\nPuzder also faced scrutiny for employing an undocumented worker and failing to pay taxes on her employment until after his nomination.\nOn the White House short list are Alexander Acosta, dean of Florida International University College of Law and a former Republican National Labor Relations Board member; Peter Kirsanow, also a former Republican NLRB member; and Catherine Templeton, who ran South Carolina’s Health and Environmental Control and Labor Licensing Regulation Department.\nAnother possibility is Joseph Guzman, a professor at Michigan State University’s human resources and labor department. Guzman met with Trump in January.\nMadeline Conway contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T19:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T03:58:38.133+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
