Deckard Shaw from Furious 7 . Plot aside, though, the most exciting part of this trailer was when everybody was driving cars while on the run from a submarine . That’s god damn crazy, and it makes us wonder how the serious could possibly get any more ridiculous after this point, but doubting The Fast And The Furious has never been a good idea. \nAnyway, The Fate Of The Furious will be in theaters on April 14.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T08:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T03:11:23.331+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
