PUBLISHED: 01:54,  24, Fri, Feb 3, 2017 \nLaura Perrins, co-editor of The Conservative Woman, received rapturous applause from audience members when delivering a brutal critique of last years referendum campaign. \nThe former barrister said: “This was not just a civilised debate that went on before this campaign. It was a serious amount of bullying of the public in Britain to stay in the EU, or else. BBC Laura Perrins gave an impassioned defence of Brexit Related articles 'You're not even an OPPOSITION' Labour MP Emily Thornberry ROASTED \n“And that particularly came from George Osborne and, I’m afraid, Mark Carney. We were told there would be a punishment budget and that didn’t happen. \n“We were told that growth would collapse and that hasn’t happened. Yet again the Bank of England have upped their forecast. \n“We were told that companies would flee the country, and this wasn’t just after we left the EU, this was immediately after the referendum, we were given dark forecasts that Armageddon would happen. BBC Perrins blamed Osborne for 'bullying' the British people \n“The people were bullied, the people didn’t listen to them, people saw that the EU was in serious difficulties themselves and they voted to regain control of their borders. \n“And they were totally right.” \nThe Dubliner refused to be drawn into making economic forecasts for the future – unlike former Chancellor and the incumbent Bank of England Governor – but maintained that Brexit would be a “great decision” for the country. \nShe said: “It’s very important to remember that Britain is in a much strong position than the rest of continental Europe. BBC Question Time was held in Wallasey \n“Italy is basically bankrupt, Greece is bankrupt, Spain is bankrupt and when we are out of the EU the vast majority of people will see it is a great decision for Britain, a great decision.” \nFellow panelist Maajid Nawaz, who unsuccessfully stood for election as a Liberal Democrat MP, urged Remoaners to accept the election defeat and move on. \nThe 39-year-old LBC radio host also refused to be drawn into predicting what a post- Brexit Britain could resemble. \nHe told the Wallasey audience: “The truth is none of us know how it’s going to turn out. And we shouldn’t predict gloom at this stage because it may well turn out as a success.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T08:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T04:27:26.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
