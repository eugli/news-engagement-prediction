If you produce a million Ferrari cars, nobody will care about buying a Ferrari.\n“Before, if you threw a stone you would hit one Datuk. Now, you throw a stone you hit two Datuks!”\nJohor Ruler Sultan Ibrahim ibni Almarhum Sultan Iskandar, whose state gives out the least of such awards, gave another twist to the joke last year: “If you throw a stone, it would hit a Datuk and when the stone rebounds, it would hit another Datuk”.\nAt the rate the numbers of our Datuks are rising, instead of ikan kembong they might be soon compared with ikan bilis (anchovies), albeit not as highly priced as the tiny fish.\nBesides the titles given out by Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the 13 states and Federal Territories, there are also dubious, unrecognised ones.\nIt seems silly but there is no shortage of people, including professionals, who are willing to fork out hundreds of thousands to buy fake Datukships from the likes of the self-proclaimed “Sultan of Malacca”, one Negri Sembilan chieftain, the so-called “royals” of Surakarta/Solo and Palembang (Indonesia), the “Sultan” of Sulu and “Sultan Kudarat of Mindanao” Philippines).\nIt is about buying social status to keep them level with peers holding recognised awards, a case of our own “ kiasu ” syndrome.\nWith no national registry listing who-is-holding-what-title-from-where, the bogus Datuk Seris and Datuks in our midst can’t be traced.\nIn any case, no one really cares, except those who pay for these phony titles and we all know that Malaysian Datuks come under three categories – A, B, or C.\nA is for “ anugerah ” (award), B for “ beli ” (buy) and C for “ cucu ” (grandchild as Datuk also means grandfather in Malay).\nWhat is alarming, though, is the conferring of state titles to people who obviously do not qualify – gangsters, drug traffickers and other such criminal elements.\nTwo weeks ago, The Star reported that four politicians holding the titles of “Datuk Seri” and “Datuk” were among 60 hardened gangsters detained in the biggest crackdown on organised crime, guns and under a recent special police operation.\nThe Datuk Seri turned out to be the leader of Penang’s Gang 24 while the three other “Datuks” were members of the notorious Gang 360 Devan, a splinter faction of Gang 36, infamous for committing extortion, drug trafficking and kidnappings.\nThe assortment of weapons seized – a CZ 9mm automatic pistol, a Baretta .22 handgun, three Glock 19 pistols and a Vixen sniper rifle – revealed the gangs’ violent inclinations while the 20.3kg of syabu and 10.8kg of heroin worth RM1.75mil seized from the houses of these gangsters exposed their primary source of income.\nOn Monday, Datuk Seri Ng Chian Sia, 55, and 21 others aged between 26 and 46 were charged in a Penang Sessions Court for being members of an organised criminal gang.\nThe charge under Section 130V (1) of the Penal Code carries a jail term of up to 20 years upon conviction.\nThe activities of Gang 24 came under police scrutiny after its reputed second-in-command, Datuk Ong Teik Kwong, 32, also known as Datuk M (as in Muda or young) was shot dead by his bodyguard on Dec 1, last year.\nWith due respect to the Rulers and the Yang di-Pertua Negeri, isn’t it about time that the perception of “Datuk B” is addressed and rectified to bring back the dignity of the award?\nThe continued granting of such titles to crooks and criminals sullies the very institution of the monarchy, a main pillar of the nation.\nMedia consultant M.
