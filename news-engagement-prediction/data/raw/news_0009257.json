Muir, of of Sandycombe Road, Richmond upon Thames, denied one count of killing a wild Mallard duck but was convicted by magistrates. He will be sentenced later this month. CCTV footage showed Muir enticing the Mallard duck over to him twice before grabbing it and breaking its neck Detective Constable Sarah Bailey from the Met's Wildlife and Crime Unit said: 'Muir lured over a female Mallard duck with food in full view of members of the public. 'Ducks in Richmond are well accustomed to human interaction. 'Muir has used this to cruelly entice and kill this wild duck. 'There was no element of sport or necessity, but it was a callous, random act of cruelty. 'I hope today's verdict serves as a reminder that wild birds are protected and animal cruelty is unacceptable and we will always pursue those who inflict harm and break clear Wildlife and Countryside legislation.'
