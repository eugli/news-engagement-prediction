(Picture: REX Features/Getty) \nTom Hardy has been pushed aside in the race to become the next James Bond, according to the bookies. Just Kate Winslet and Idris Elba sharing a kiss on the set of their new movie \nActors James Norton and Michael Fassbender are now the bookies favourites to be granted a license to kill and it’s getting really close. \nAccording to Coral, both Norton and Fassbender are at 5/2 to take over from Daniel Craig, but according to William Hill’s bets Fassbender is in the lead with 5/2 and Norton follows closely with 4/1. \nHardy follows in close contention at both of the bookies at 11/4. Michael Fassbender and James Norton are currently in the lead (Picture: REX) \nDescribing Norton’s shortening odds, Dan Stevens from Coral said: ‘Out of nowhere we’ve been hit with a surge of bets for Norton to be the next Bond. Even after slashing the odds to 5/2 we are still seeing money for the actor, leaving us both shaken and stirred.’ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:29:16.629+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
