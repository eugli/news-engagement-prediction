Many leaders from Trinamool Congress, CPM and Congress are contacting us to join our party . We will refer their applications to our scrutiny committee, which will go through the applications and find out their past records, whether they were involved in any sort of scam and corruption. We will give such persons our membership on the basis of recommendations of our scrutiny committee,\" Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh told ET on Tuesday. \n\nBJP's Bengal spokesperson Krishanu Mitra has left all key positions of the party after raising the issue of allowing tainted, corrupt and unscrupulous CPM leaders to become BJP members. The party's decision to set up the committee was taken after Mitra's resignation.\"Krishanu has raised a very serious issue. We can't strengthen ourselves by inducting corrupt leaders from other parties into our organisation,\" said a senior BJP leader. BJP insiders said that some recent incidents have forced the party to tighten the process of giving memberships to leaders from rival parties. \"A few months back, the police had arrested one of our leaders who joined us from the Congress. This leader was arrested allegedly for receiving lakhs of rupees from candidates who had appeared in the School Service Commission examinations. He is not yet a convicted but his arrest has certainly been an embarrassment for us,\" another leader said. \n\nThere has been controversy within BJP over giving membership to expelled CPM leader Lakshman Seth, who was reportedly involved in the Nandigram massacre in which 14 people were killed in March 2007 over the issue of forcible land acquisition by the then Left Front government for setting up of an SEZ there.
