Nobody is on Twitter. I am on Snapchat, though.” Photo: Bobby Doherty/New York Magazine Celia Draycott, High-School Sophomore\nHow’s sophomore year treating you?\nGood, I have a free right now. I go to Saint Ann’s, and there are just no words to describe it. I love it here. But I have nothing to compare it to, since it’s the only school I’ve been to.\nSo what are the kids into these days?\nWell, politics and social justice are huge among my friends. Especially after the election. Everything from bashing Trump to other stuff. As for fashion, the ’80s are extremely in. Turtlenecks and high-waisted jeans. Patches, pins, and embroidery are huge — I recently embroidered an eye onto the back pocket of my jeans. And then for social media, I just got off Instagram, and I’m not on Facebook. Nobody is on Twitter. I am on Snapchat, though. And there’s this new app called Houseparty . Basically, you’re just FaceTiming with up to eight people, and anyone you’re friends with can join your call. So, like, my friends and I will all be at home doing a Houseparty, and some random person three grades below will join in.\nLightning Round\nHair : “I wash it, and when it’s still wet, I braid it and sleep on it.”\nFavorite thrift store : L Train Vintage.\nCurrently reading : “I just finished Hamlet . ”\nCurrently watching : “I’m always watching The Office . I didn’t watch it when it was on TV, but I watch on Netflix.”\nFavorite street : Verandah Place in Cobble Hill. “It feels European.”\n*This article appears in the February 6, 2017, issue of New York Magazine.\nTags: look book street style high school '80s fashion houseparty new york magazine More These Are the 23 Makeup Products From Lady Gaga’s Super Bowl Look Gloria Steinem Throws Her Support Behind Keith Ellison for DNC Chair The Queen’s Yearbook Photo Is Way Nicer Than Yours goop\nClean Beauty and Why It’s Important\nHuffPost Lifestyle\nTeen Vogue: The Complete Guide To Color Correcting Any…\nPOPSUGAR Fashion\nMichelle Obama's Dress Will Tell You Exactly Where…\n 17 mins ago These Are the 23 Makeup Products From Lady Gaga’s Super Bowl Look Because she’s wasn’t just born that way.\n25 mins ago Gloria Steinem Throws Her Support Behind Keith Ellison for DNC Chair The feminist activist said Ellison “can and will lead the Democratic Party to a principled and populist victory.”\n26 mins ago The Queen’s Yearbook Photo Is Way Nicer Than Yours But where are the corgis?\n10:45 a.m. The\n10:43 a.m. Ruth When she started, her daughter was 14 months old.\n10:35 a.m. Coach\nYesterday at 12:48 p.m. Watch Taylor Swift Get Acoustic at What Might Be Her Only Concert of the Year Soak her in while you can.", "external_links": ["http://www.huffingtonpost.com/teen-vogue/the-complete-guide-to-col_b_9432526.html", "http://traffic.pubexchange.com/l/db1a9572-737a-40c7-8c53-37b4b60f95a1/6a3545d1-3f03-40d5-be9c-b3e7d50316a6/a39405a0-1d20-47f1-b800-a5e920a87e97/f?u=goop.com", "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/4110440/images/n-CONCEALER-628x314.jpg);", "http://www.vulture.com/tv/the-office/", "http://goop.com/clean-beauty-and-why-its-important/", "http://traffic.pubexchange.com/l/db1a9572-737a-40c7-8c53-37b4b60f95a1/46894e1c-ead0-4527-8acf-da3db7c74f84/7c6f6444-77a0-4260-89e2-7d671ca87d28/f?u=popsugar.com/fashion", "http://traffic.pubexchange.com/l/db1a9572-737a-40c7-8c53-37b4b60f95a1/ba6acc8f-88ed-4c51-a7ea-8308856bc1f1/f3343121-417e-4eed-88b6-4de2cc4c53e1/f?u=huffingtonpost.com", "https://twitter.com/share?text=The%20Tenth-Grader%20Who%20Says%20%E2%80%9980s%20Fashion%20Is%20%E2%80%98Extremely%20In%E2%80%99&url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2017/02/the-tenth-grader-who-says-80s-fashion-is-extremely-in.html%3Fmid%3Dtwitter-share-thecut&via=thecut", "https://www.pubexchange.com/home/index/nymag", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://nymag.com/thecut/2017/02/the-tenth-grader-who-says-80s-fashion-is-extremely-in.html%3Fmid%3Dfb-share-thecut", "http://www.popsugar.com/fashion/Michelle-Obama-Vacation-Dresses-42942202", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/NU1IOKBAbrQCIRiHzI6dKvUJ1Ds/fit-in/320x320/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-:sharpen-!1,0,true!-/2017/01/05/856/n/1922564/7da40691586e9f5f9d0d10.26194709_edit_img_cover_file_15741505_1483641713_14836447517128.jpg);", "http://goop.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/clean-beauty-learn-4-150x150.jpg);", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0486272788"], "published": "2017-02-06T04:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T18:31:06.557+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
