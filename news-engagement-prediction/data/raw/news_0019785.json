Marge takes an instant liking to John — but Homer is horrified to learn that he’s gay. Source: Supplied \nWhile the rest of the family embrace their new friend, Homer rejects John — and even suspects exposure to him may be ‘turning’ Bart gay. \nThere’s a lot at play in the episode, as it deals with Homer’s prejudice, the Simpson family’s exposure to a previously foreign gay culture, and John’s appreciation of his new friends for their ‘camp’ value. \nThe Fox network, it seems, wanted to ditch all of it. They work hard — they play hard. Source: YouTube \nWhen Simpsons staff submitted scripts for network approval, censors usually responded with just a few notes, asking that certain lines or jokes be slightly altered. \nFor Homer’s Phobia , the team at The Simpons received dozens of notes regarding “every single thing in the episode that had to do with being gay or the word ‘gay’,” Simpsons showrunner Bill Oakley tells The Ringer . \nThe three pages of notes ended with one simple ruling: “The entire subject and content of this episode is unacceptable for air.” ‘Homer’s Phobia’ saw the Simpson family befriend an out gay man — with mixed results. Source: Supplied \n“They didn’t want anything to do with it from A to Z,” Oakley recalls — but those working on The Simpons didn’t give up on the episode. Instead, they charged ahead, hoping that something would happen later in the process to make the network give way (a daring move, given each Simpsons episode takes a year — and millions of dollars — to produce). \nMiraculously, they caught a break. In the ensuing 10 months after the initial script rejection, the network’s censor left and was replaced with a new — presumably more forward-thinking — censor. When they resubmitted the episode, the Simpsons team received only one note back: “acceptable for broadcast.” The Simpsons returned to gay issues more frequently in recent years, with Homer even officiating a same-sex wedding in one episode.

Homer’s Phobia is considered on of the best episodes from The Simpsons ’ golden years, scoring the show an Emmy Award and gifting the world the instantly iconic ‘gay steel mill’ scene: The gay steel mill", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T08:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T08:54:21.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
