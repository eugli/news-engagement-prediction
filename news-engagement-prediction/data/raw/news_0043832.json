Climate change to blame: Baron \nHe blamed climate change. \n\"It's not an assessment, it's a fact,\" he said. \nHe said the forests have suffered in the relatively warm, nutrient-poor East Australian Current while not getting a rejuvenating hit from the Southern Ocean during winter. \nMr Baron believed there was no coming back. \n\"In my opinion, they're gone forever\", he said. \n\"There might be an occasional regeneration on a very small scale but the trend over all those years ... nutrient levels are just too low to maintain decent levels of growth.\" \nA number of scientists from Tasmania's Institute of Marine and Antarctic Studies will also give evidence to the inquiry.
