She did it because it is insane that a government building would proudly fly one of the most overt symbols of black oppression . The flag was re-raised within an hour of Newsome being arrested, but weeks later South Carolina’s House of Representatives voted to permanently remove the flag. Her actions were inspiring to all, including Muhiyidin Elamin Moye, a Black Lives Matter Charleston leader who goes by Muhiyidin d’Baha. He has now become immortalized as the badass dude who leaped through police tape to grab a Confederate flag out of a man protesting Bree Newsome last night.

A group called the South Carolina Secessionist Party and another group called the Confederate Flaggers started displaying Confederate flags to protest Newsome on various buildings around Charleston. In response, counter-protesters showed up to support Newsome and, judging by the now-iconic video of d’Baha, to continue her mission of taking down the Confederate flag. D’Baha didn’t make it far with the flag (though the pole did break), and he was subsequently arrested and charged with disorderly conduct by Charleston police. The Charleston chapter of Showing Up For Racial Justice (or SURJ) has started collecting donations for d’Baha’s bail money.
