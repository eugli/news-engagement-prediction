Rhian Deutron X \nControversial former Liberal MP Ross Cameron defended his bizarre appearance at a fundraising dinner overnight that was slammed for offensive comments made by guests about homosexuals and Muslims. \nThe Q Society, a far right, anti-Islam organisation, held a fundraising dinner in Sydney in which cartoonist Larry Pickering donated one of his works which collected $600 at auction, depicting the rape of a woman wearing a niqab. \nSeveral members of the media were present at the dinner, in which Mr Pickering made staggering comments about Muslims, including the declaration: “Let’s be honest, I can’t stand Muslims … If they are in the same street as me, I start shaking. \n“They are not all bad, they do chuck pillow-biters off buildings,” he then said during his speech. \nThe comments were widely condemned today across social media, with many people calling for a public apology from those who spoke at the event. \nSam Dastyari today called on Malcolm Turnbull to forbid Liberal MP George Christensen from attending the Q Society’s second fundraiser, which is to be held in Melbourne tonight. Cory Bernadi, who resigned from the LNP this week, will also be attending. — Sam Dastyari (@samdastyari) February 10, 2017 \nMr Cameron, who hosts a show on Sky News, also made an allegedly “rambling speech” in which he consistently spoke about homosexuals, called the NSW division of the Liberal Party “a gay club” and described the Sydney Morning Herald as the “Sydney Morning Homosexual”. Is going too far just not possible anymore? Seriously, what the hell? https://t.co/Sa23ZYm83U — Peter van Onselen (@vanOnselenP) February 10, 2017 \n“Trigger warning for the Herald, there are heterosexuals in the room … I have to warn you there are some males who are attracted to females in this room,” Mr Cameron said during his bizarre speech. \nAppearing on the Janine Perrett show this afternoon on Sky News, Mr Cameron took aim at the Sydney Morning Herald for conflating his speech with Mr Pickering’s and using an unflattering photograph of him, describing the outlet as a “bully”. \n“What I object to is the Sydney Morning Herald taking the view that the vast sweep of Australians are homophobic, racist, rednecks,” Mr Cameron said on the show this afternoon. I'm actually scared where this kind of hate is going. What's happening to society. NZ is looking like a good option right now. — Peter van Onselen (@vanOnselenP) February 10, 2017 \nWhen asked to offer an apology to the LGBTI community, Mr Cameron appeared to step around the issue. \n“I would like to spend the rest of my life without doing anything to make a person who feels their sexual preference is being criticised or challenged or ridiculed,” Mr Cameron. \n“If the reporting of these comments has caused someone to feel a greater sense of isolation over their attraction then I very sincerely apologise”. \nThe talk show host mercilessly clapped back. \n“Ross, that was the worst apology I have ever heard,” Ms Perrett said. I don't condone violence. I believe in free speech even when I disagree. Actions can be condemned but ideas must be debated. #freespeech — Kirralie Smith (@KirralieS) February 10, 2017 \nMs Perrett continued to probe her guest, asking if he could appreciate that people were offended by Mr Pickering’s “unacceptable” comments about Muslims. \n“It is the job of people like me to not be offended. It is the job of people like me to suck it up,” Mr Cameron said. \nHe defended his speech, saying he never made disparaging comments about homosexuals but directed his joke to a SMH reporter present on the night. \n“I said I’m not going to talk to you about Islam, I’m going to talk to you about freedom of speech and freedom of opinion and I said I want to welcome the Sydney Morning Homosexual,” Mr Cameron. \n“I went into that speech last night quite determined to distinguish between the gay person and what I regard as the political ideology of mandatory support for gay marriage which I reject and I object to.” \nBefore the interview was abruptly concluded, Mr Cameron launched a scathing attack on the SMH, likening the paper to a bully and a dog. \n“It was not my objective to offend people, it was my objective to offend the Sydney Morning Herald because they deserve it,” he said. \n“They spend their lives, like a bully, like a big Alsatian on the front yard when somebody steps one degree over the line, letting out the dogs as they are doing now to me ... to seek to destroy dissent and alternative opinion,” \nMr Cameron described himself as the “captain of liberality in relation to matters of sexuality”. \nProtesters have gathered St Kilda Marina in Melbourne to stop the Q Society’s second dinner this evening. — Asher Wolf (@Asher_Wolf) February 10, 2017 \nProtesters have clashed with people attending a fundraiser held by the far-right, anti-Islam Q Society, which is headlined by Liberal MP George Christensen and former Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi. \nMore than a hundred people gathered at St Kilda Marina to stop the organisation’s Melbourne event, which was held at a secret location “tba (to be announced) to booked guests”. \n“When Cory Bernardi is in town, shut it down, shut it down,” protesters chanted, holding placards with the words ‘Fascist Free Zone’ and ‘F… Donald Trump’. \nThe protesters also shouted “racists, sexists, anti-queer, fascists are not welcome here”, before the bus left around 7pm, reportedly carrying about a dozen attendees.
