We’re not paid anything.” \nAmnesty International’s investigation documents 33 drug-related incidents where 59 people were killed, the vast majority of which “appear to have been extrajudicial executions,” it said. \nThe lengthy report, released Tuesday, concludes that the widespread killings, many ordered directly by government, “may constitute crimes against humanity” under international law. \n“This is not a war on drugs, but a war on the poor,” Tirana Hassan, Amnesty International’s crisis response director, said in a statement. “Often on the flimsiest of evidence, people accused of using or selling drugs are being killed for cash in an economy of murder.” \nOf the 7,025 drug-related killings between July 1, 2016 and Jan. 21, 2017, police were directly involved in at least 2,500, the group found. Additionally, officers have reportedly been found planting evidence and falsifying reports, stealing from those they kill and working directly with funeral homes to make an extra profit off the grieving families. \nOn Wednesday, Filipino Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II, dismissed Amnesty International’s report , claiming the killings can’t be crimes against humanity because drug offenders are not human, The Washington Post reported. \n“How can that be when your war is only against drug lords, drug addicts, drug pushers? You consider them humanity? No. I believe not,” he said, according to the publication. \nDuterte’s violent anti-drug campaign has created what the report calls a “pervasive climate of fear” in the Philippines. Photojournalist Daniel Berehulak, who documented 57 homicide victims over 35 days for The New York Times, wrote that his experience “felt like a new level of ruthlessness: police officers’ summarily shooting anyone suspected of dealing or even using drugs, vigilantes’ taking seriously Mr. Duterte’s call to ‘slaughter them all.’” \nThe Amnesty International report calls on Duterte to end the extrajudicial executions and for the Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute anyone involved, even members of the police force. \nAlthough it is unlikely that the anti-drug killings will stop, Duterte has acknowledged police corruption. On Monday, following the death of a South Korean businessman, he sidelined his drug war to target crooked cops . \n“You are corrupt to the core,” he said. “It’s in your system. Cleanse your ranks. Review their cases. Give me a list of who the scalawags are.” \nRead the full Amnesty International report here . \nWarning: The following video may be disturbing to viewers.
