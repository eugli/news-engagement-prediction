The appeals court is expected to issue a ruling as soon as Wednesday. \n“I don’t ever want to call a court biased,” Trump told a few hundred police chiefs and sheriffs from major cities at a meeting in Washington. “So I won’t call it biased. And we haven’t had a decision yet. But courts seem to be so political. And it would be so great for our justice system if they would be able to read the statement and do what’s right. \n“I think it’s a sad day. I think our security’s at risk today,” Trump said. \nTrump’s January 27 order barred travellers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering for 90 days and all refugees for 120 days, except those from Syria, whom he would ban indefinitely. He said his directive was “done for the security of our nation, the security of our citizens.” Read more Donald Trump’s US travel ban order: A legal headache \nThe appeals court must decide if Trump acted within his authority or whether his directive was tantamount to a discriminatory ban targeting Muslims. The appeals court judges questioned whether the directive improperly targeted people because of their religion. \n“If these judges wanted to, in my opinion, help the court in terms of respect for the court, they’d do what they should be doing,” the Republican president said. \nLast week Trump labeled the judge who put his directive on hold, US district Judge James Robart of Seattle, who was appointed by Republican President George W. Bush, a “so-called judge.” Last year Trump sharply attacked a judge who was presiding over a case involving one of his businesses. \nIn a Twitter post earlier on Wednesday, Trump wrote, “If the US does not win this case as it so obviously should, we can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled.

He said the law clearly allowed a president to suspend entry of any class of people if he determines would be a detriment to national security. \n“A bad high school student would understand this,” Trump said. “Anybody would understand this.” \nJudge Richard Clifton, who was appointed to the bench by Bush, posed equally tough questions for a lawyer representing Minnesota and Washington states, which are challenging the ban. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T04:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:54:19.543+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
