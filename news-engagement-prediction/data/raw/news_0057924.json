How to survive falling through ice Don't remove your winter clothing Turn towards the direction you came â€” that's probably the strongest ice Place hands and arms on the unbroken surface Kick your feet to work your way back onto the solid ice Lie flat on the ice and roll away from the hole to keep your weight spread out and avoid breaking through again Get to a warm, sheltered area and rewarm yourself immediately Source: Minnesota Department of National Resources \n\"Some of those kids would have gone under the water if we didn't go in, so God was looking out for them and was looking out for me and I was in this park for a reason tonight,\" Mr Jonas said. \nIn a video posted to his Instagram account Mr Turnbull told journalists of the moment he realised the teens were in trouble. \n\"I could see them standing on the ice as we were skating around ... as we came back around, I could hear them screaming by that stage and then when we got there they were well submerged in the water,\" he said. \n\"The guys at the back were just on top of one another ... it wasn't nice.\" \nHe laughed off a reporter's suggestion he and Mr Jonas were heroes. \n\"I think we were just right time, right place to be honest.\" \nAAP/ABC", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:37:18.867+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
