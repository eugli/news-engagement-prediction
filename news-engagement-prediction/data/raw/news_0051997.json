Story continues below \nCalhoun said deputies are questioning people, but have no suspects yet. Officials believe the killings took place sometime Monday night. They didn’t find any signs of forced entry. \n“We’re leaning more toward somebody who knows the family or is known by the family,” the deputy noted, saying a random killing appeared unlikely. \nThe slain were identified as 65-year-old Edna Durr, her daughters Tomecca Pickett, 42, and Kiearra Durr, 27. Also killed was Pickett’s 5-year-old son, Owen Pickett. Ward said Kierra Durr’s 3-year-old daughter was not shot and survived. \nDemetrus Durr told local media that the victims were his mother, two sisters and his nephew. \n“I want to know who did it. Whoever did it, they don’t deserve to live,” he told The Meridian Star . “Justice is going to have to be served.” \nNeighbors suspected something was wrong when no one had heard from the family Tuesday morning. \n“Nobody was answering the phone or the door,” said Irene Harrison, who lives nearby on the same rural road. \nPolice were called and a deputy discovered broken glass. He and a second deputy forced their way inside, finding the bodies. \n“This is a shock to everyone,” Harrison said. \nOfficials worked at the crime scene for hours Tuesday, setting up a tent as they search the property for evidence. Calhoun said the bodies have been taken to Mississippi’s state crime lab for autopsies. © 2017 The Canadian Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:16:12.509+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
