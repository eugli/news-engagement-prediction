Editor Advertisement \nAVA flipflops and now twists their words, adding more reasons why the Sin Ming chickens have to be killed. This approach of making a one-sided decision, then finding excuses to justify it later, seems to be very common in Singapore. \nWhat is even more disturbing is that AVA is refusing to address and acknowledge allegations that Red Junglefowl may have been accidentally culled instead of wild chickens. Photo evidence have surfaced, suggesting that the \"chickens\" in Sin Ming are actually the endangered species Red Junglefowl. AVA has refused to address these allegations, and the reason for their actions is up for speculation. \nRegardless, no one will be punished, just like the SGH Hepatitis outbreak. AVA's pain and regret will be punishment enough. \nVery Angry Citizen \nA.S.S. Contributor Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
