The question has been preying on my mind all week, since I went to a party last Friday unlike any I’d been asked to before. It was thrown by a dear friend, not yet 50 and still looking thirtysomething, who has been told by her doctors that they can do no more to stop the spread of her cancer, and she has only months left to live. She was blowed, she thought, if she was prepared to wait until she was cold in her coffin for friends and family to say nice things about her and raise a glass or two in celebration of her life. If a crystal ball told me I was about to die I'd treat Mrs U to a holiday. But in truth I really don't want to know what the future holds If she was condemned to go the way of all flesh, decades before her time, she wanted to be there, while there was still breath in her body, to hear and enjoy it all and say goodbye. I must say that when I received her invitation, I had slight qualms that the occasion might be like one of those ‘living funerals’ I’ve read about, which are said to be catching on in the United States. Over there, apparently, such events tend to follow the form of conventional funeral rites, starting with sombre music and Bible readings before moving on to eulogies of the soon-to-be-deceased. Often, a coffin is present — though empty, of course. It all sounds hideously macabre to me. But as I should have guessed, fun-loving Lucy’s party wasn’t a bit like that. Yes, there were profoundly moving speeches — including one from the star of the show herself (the least corpse-like apparition you can imagine, in an orange tutu and figure-hugging leotard that only the bravest and most beautiful like her could carry off). A single mum, she made a heart-rending plea that we should look after her teenage daughters when she was gone — a task for which I predict no shortage of competition, since the two girls have inherited their mother’s abundant gifts and dazzling looks. Otherwise, there was little to distinguish this from any other hugely enjoyable party, apart from poignant family photographs of the lovely Lucy’s life, projected on to a huge screen at the back of the venue. Oh, and her daughters gave us a brilliant rendition, knocking spots off anything you’ve heard on The Voice or The X Factor, of one of their mother’s favourite songs — Joni Mitchell’s A Case of You. A brief digression. It’s one of my favourites, too, and I yield to no one in my admiration of Joni as a lyricist. But I’ve never properly understood the line in the chorus: ‘I could drink a case of you, darling, and I would still be on my feet.’ My difficulty is that it sounds more insulting than affectionate. Most lovers, surely, would prefer to be thought intoxicating, and to be serenaded with a line such as: ‘I could drink a sip of you, darling, and I’d be knocked clean off my bar stool.’ But then maybe Joni intended the sentiment to be rude. I’d be most grateful for readers’ elucidation. But back to the party and the question with which I began. Of course, if Lucy hadn’t been given advance warning that she had so little time left, the event would not have taken place and she would have been denied the chance of hearing how much she is loved and appreciated. But would you like to be able to see into the future like that? A survey of 2,000 people in this week’s Psychological Review suggests that the great majority of us would answer a resounding ‘No’. The study, by researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin and the University of Granada in Spain, finds that up to 90 per cent of us don’t want foreknowledge of bad news such as death, divorce or dementia. Meanwhile, as many as 70 per cent don’t want to know in advance about positive events, either — with the single exception that more people than not (63 per cent) would want to know the sex of their unborn baby. As it happens, I’ve reached an age at which it would be hugely to my advantage to know exactly when my time will come to pop my clogs. I wouldn’t buy a Lamborghini (I can think of few things I want less, apart from a copy of Harriet Harman’s memoirs) With my retirement date less than two years away, just lately I’ve been bombarded with letters from three occupational pension schemes, run by employers past and present, asking if I want to cash in my savings or draw a modest income for the rest of my days. Well, it all depends, doesn’t it? If I knew I was going to die within weeks of retirement, I’d grab every penny I could right now. True, I wouldn’t buy a Lamborghini (I can think of few things I want less, apart from a copy of Harriet Harman’s memoirs). But at least I could treat myself and my wife to a top-of-the-range holiday, with perhaps something left over to invest for her when I’m no longer around. On the other hand, if my fate is to hang on until I’m 90 or 100 — highly unlikely, I grant you, since I’m a heavy-drinking chain-smoker — it would obviously make sense to stick with the pension schemes. Since I’ve been paying into them for 40 years, the difference between making the right and the wrong choice would amount to a six-figure sum. Yes, I can see that an infallible crystal ball would come in mighty handy for picking lottery numbers or runners and riders in the 3.45 at Kempton Park If only I could be sure how much time I had left, I’d have no trouble knowing what to do. And yet, like the huge majority in that psychological survey, I haven’t the slightest wish to know. I’m with most of those questioned, too, who don’t want advance knowledge of happy events, such as their team’s victory in the FA Cup or stunning success for their children. Unlike the 63 per cent, I didn’t even want to know the sex of our babies before they were born. Yes, I can see that an infallible crystal ball would come in mighty handy for picking lottery numbers or runners and riders in the 3.45 at Kempton Park. But surely it would also rob life of the surprises, good and bad, that make it so interesting. And what would be put in newspapers if everyone knew about Brexit, Trump and last year’s triumph of Leicester City years in advance? What would be put in newspapers if everyone knew about Brexit, Trump and last year’s triumph of Leicester City years in advance? As for foreknowledge of death or disease, of course, it would help us plan sensibly for the future. But I count it as one of the great sadnesses of our age that increasingly accurate tests exist to tell us if we are likely to suffer dementia, say, or have no chance of producing children. Isn’t false hope better than no hope at all? But then, we can all draw at least a crumb of comfort from the knowledge that experts can be spectacularly wrong. Witness the polls before the EU referendum and the British and American elections. Look at the resurgence of Roger Federer to triumph in the Australian Open, months after tennis buffs had pronounced him finished. And wasn’t this the week Bank of England officials finally admitted their computer models were useless at predicting recessions (though I don’t recall Governor Mark Carney telling us anything of the sort before the referendum, when he assured us that a Brexit vote would bring the sky crashing down)? All I can do is join Lucy’s family in praying like crazy that her doctors prove as lousy at fortune-telling as the hapless Mr Carney. Let’s have plenty more parties like last Friday’s, before it’s time to say farewell.
