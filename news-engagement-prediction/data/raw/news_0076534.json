In fact, they even argued that in their brief.” \nAnd in a tentative ruling Friday, a judge found the documents are, in fact, public record and the public should have a right to see it. \nThe judge stated that there is significant public interest in DPH’s investigation into risks associated with cellular phone use and advising the public as to those risks. \nMoskowitz cites new research that finds a significant relationship between cell phone use of 10 or more years and increased brain tumor risk. \nThe Department of Public Health would not comment on the ruling or if it intends to release the documents. \nLawyers note they could appeal. \nThe FCC says there is no evidence of a “definite link between wireless devices and cancer or other illnesses.” \nBut, Moskowitz, who believes cell phones do pose health risks and urges users to limit their contact with them, hopes the ruling will at least help call attention to the issue.
