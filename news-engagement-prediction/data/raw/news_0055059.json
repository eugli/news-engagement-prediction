Judging from the photos, the yellow princess ball gown is better than we imagined. Made with silk, the dress has a satin finish that glows for the camera while the layers of organza give the dress a light, bouncy lift. Though parts of the costume has a cage, one specific constricting piece was left out of the new design. \nBeauty and the Beast 's costume designer Jacqueline Durran revealed in an interview that Belle's dress in the live-action film would not have a corset, a change Emma pushed for herself . \n\"For Emma, it was important that the dress was light and that it had a lot of movement,\" Durran said. \"In Emma's reinterpretation, Belle is an active princess. She did not want a dress that was corseted or that would impede her in any way.\" \nGiven that the actress is a proud feminist and supporter of HeForShe , it's not surprising she spoke up and did away with a tight-fitting bodice in the name of comfort. Scroll through for a glimpse of Belle's updated gown and other outfits, then check out Emma's green red carpet choices on the press tour.
