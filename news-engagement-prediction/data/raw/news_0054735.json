Now she hangs them up.\nThat's because she made those pyjamas — as well as a number of shirts, skirts, coats and pants — as part of an ambitious project to make her entire wardrobe herself, in just 18 months.\n\"I've discovered with sewing that nothing is ever as scary as you think it's going to be,\" she said.\n\"If you can assemble a piece of IKEA furniture, you can make a pair of jeans.\"\nWhile winter boots are too technical, Penton says she plans to try making espadrilles. (CBC News)\nPenton, 35, started the project last August and has so far made about 20 garments, recording the time and money spent on each item on her blog, myhandmadewardrobe.com .\n\"You just take it seam-by-seam and step-by-step.\" - Erica Penton Having worked in the corporate fashion world — doing everything from folding T-shirts to designing window displays — Penton told the CBC's Information Morning she wanted to draw attention to the amount of work required to create fast fashion items, as well as the true costs.\nPenton is not a professional seamstress. She taught herself to sew a few years ago. (Ryan Turner)\nTrue cost of fashion Most stores are \"not charging you the actual cost of the item,\" Penton said.\n\"It's hard for me to make a nice, button-down shirt for under $60,\" she said — and that only covers her materials, not labour.\nMost people wouldn't dream of paying that much for a shirt nowadays, she said.\nThe last time Penton calculated her overall costs , she found she had spent slightly more than $1,000 on 11 handmade items, including two winter coats.\nPenton used to throw her pyjamas on the floor in the morning. Now that they're handmade, she hangs them up.

(CBC News)\nDisasters and successes Things don't always turn out as planned, Penton said.\nShe recently attempted to make a fitted dress, but ended up with about 20 cm of extra fabric at the back. She decided to forgo the zipper and make a back-less dress instead.\nIt \"looks beautiful,\" she said.\nDIY sewing machine repair: Yellowknife couple aims at small business The most nerve-wracking project thus far involved \"distressing\" a pair of hand-made jeans.\nIt was scary, Penton said, \"having worked so hard on them and then ripping them up.\"\nPenton said she's pleased with the results. \"It felt like the ultimate act of letting go.\"\nThe last time Penton calculated her overall costs, she found she had spent slightly more than $1,000 on 11 handmade items, including two winter coats.
