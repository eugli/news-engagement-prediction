'Scared of our shadows' \nAbout 250 Christians with their belongings were now in Ismailiya's church, deacon Nabil Shukrallah said on Friday. \n\"They've come running with their children. It's a very difficult situation. We're expecting 50 or 60 more,\" he told the AFP news agency. \nMeanwhile, refugees said they were now \"scared of our shadows\", adding that they \"are being targeted in an ugly way\". \nMany of them were from the city of El-Arish, where at least seven Christians have been killed. \nEgypt has seen a wave of attacks by militants since 2013 when the military overthrew President Mohammed Morsi, an elected leader who hailed from the Muslim Brotherhood, and launched a crackdown against Islamists. \nSome of Mr Morsi's supporters blamed Christians for supporting the overthrow. \nIn December, a bomb explosion in the Coptic Christian cathedral in killed at least 25 people. What is the Coptic Christian faith? \nThe Coptic Orthodox Church is the main Christian Church in Egypt. While most Copts live in Egypt, the Church has about a million members outside the country. \nCopts believe that their Church dates back to around 50 AD, when the Apostle Mark is said to have visited Egypt. Mark is regarded as the first Pope of Alexandria - the head of their church. \nThis makes it one of the earliest Christian groups outside the Holy Land. Media caption Who are Egypt's Coptic Christians? \nThe Church separated from other Christian denominations at the Council of Chalcedon (451 AD) in a dispute over the human and divine nature of Jesus Christ. \nThe early Church suffered persecution under the Roman Empire, and there were intermittent persecutions after Egypt became a Muslim country. Many believe that continues to this day. Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T03:51:11.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
