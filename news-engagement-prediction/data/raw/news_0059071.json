That list no longer exists.” \nMario said the rumors of immigrations raids have kept him, his family and others on edge. \nRecently, ICE arrested nearly 700 illegal immigrants across the nation. \nSaldana insists the arrests are not part of spontaneous raids. “Raids make it sound like we’re going around street corners to pick people up. These were targeted enforcement actions, they take a long time to plan.” \nShe said she both sides of the illegal immigration debate have stoked fears in the community. “I’m so concerned about the climate of fear there is in the immigrant community. These rumors take a life of their own, so my hope is that both sides take a breath and pause. Wouldn’t it be great if we could get people together to talk about where we end up?” \nPresident Trump also wants to hire 10,000 ICE agents and 5,000 border patrol agents. \nSaldana said that could take years because both agencies will be competing for the same applicants and they must meet high standards. “You’ve got to find people who can pass the security background which is tough. Now that you found that person, they have to be competent, so you have to pass some interviews and tests.” \nThere are 6,000 ICE agents now, and Saldana says it was difficult to keep up with attrition. \nAs for Mario, he works in construction in Dallas, but said he left a steady job in Mexico because of safety concerns. “Drug cartels are still very prominent and active in Mexico. It’s just not a safe place to go.” \nWhile Mario has no plans to leave the U.S., he said he, his wife and two children have already discussed where they would go if they were deported. \nWhen asked what he says to people who tell him he came to the U.S. illegally and must live with the consequences, he said, “Obviously, it’s always better to do things the right way. But situations will take you to places or do things you really never thought you would have to.” \nMario said he owns a house and has always paid his property and federal income taxes. “Most of the people here, we are working. We are contributing to this country and most of us are not bad people.” \n  Jack Fink facebook Follow Jack covers politics for KTVT-TV CBS 11 and has been with the station since September 2003.
