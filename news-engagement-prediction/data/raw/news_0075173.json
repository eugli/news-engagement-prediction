Just as it’s been hard to talk about anything other than politics since November, it’s hard to talk about anything else that happened at this year’s Academy Awards ceremony in light of its entirely insane finale , in which the wrong best picture winner was read. It wasn’t Warren Beatty’s fault, it wasn’t Faye Dunaway’s fault, and it certainly wasn’t La La Land ’s fault. Somehow, some envelope wires got crossed and Moonlight —which won best picture! Moonlight won best picture!—was not initially read as the winner. That mistake was corrected in the most dramatic, awkward, and oddly exhilarating moment this 20-plus-year Oscar viewer has ever witnessed. Phew. Aside from those accidental theatrics, what happened here? How did La La Land —which once seemed destined to sweep, and still did win many awards—come up short in best picture? It could have something to do with the complicated, tiered voting system the Academy now uses for best picture. But it could also just be that Moonlight feels like a weightier and timelier film than Damien Chazelle’s wistful musical trifle. Given the political climate of the day, perhaps Academy voters simply recognized that Barry Jenkins’s sad and searching film about racial and sexual identity is the true movie of the moment. Whatever the reason, Moonlight ’s win would have been shocking without the whole catastrophic on-stage mix-up. But it’s the good kind of shocking. Sometimes the Academy gets it right, and Moonlight ’s win is a shining, if strange and suddenly scandal-plagued, example of that. Other than its wild last scene, the Oscars were pretty good this year, no? Host Jimmy Kimmel largely kept things at a pleasant frequency, pitched somewhere between respect and lighthearted disdain. The evening’s political tenor was more muted than I had expected, though there were certainly both oblique allusions and direct references to the Trump administration’s controversial policies peppered throughout the night. Presenter Gael Garcia Bernal spoke against the Mexican border wall. In absentia, Iranian foreign language film winner Asghar Farhadi criticized the Muslim ban . And screenplay winner Barry Jenkins insisted that he and others would be fighting for rights and recognition alongside those most affected for the next four years. But for the most part, these Oscars were relatively amiable and swift. I say “swift” despite the fact that the show did run long, partly owed to the fact that Kimmel was bound and determined to bring up his faux-feud joke with Matt Damon as often as possible. By its last, creaking invocation tonight, that long-tired gag was firmly beaten to death, coming across as nothing more than solipsistic time-wasting. Kimmel’s heavy reliance on that old routine was his major fumble tonight. Otherwise, he did a fine, if unremarkable, job. I know it was polarizing—at least on Twitter—but I quite enjoyed the extended bit that had a group of supposedly unsuspecting tour bus riders plopped into the middle of the Oscar broadcast. Their sheer shock at suddenly being confronted with a rogue’s gallery of movie stars was a delight—and it served as a healthy reminder of who is actually famous in “real America.” Denzel Washington ? Yes. Casey Affleck ? Not so much, maybe. Voting-wise, the Academy did a nice job of spreading the wealth around. The expected La La Land dominance didn’t exactly come to pass, with films like Arrival and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them upsetting the film in some technical categories. The screenplay awards went to the auteurs behind the year’s two other front-runners, which felt fair. And Moonlight ’s eventual best picture win signals that, perhaps, the overhauling of the Academy—a diversification initiative aimed at making the Oscars more inclusive—may actually have some positive effect. It may take some tumult to get things right, but the Academy could be on the road to genuine progress. Of course, the Oscars are just the end-point banquet of the Hollywood year, so real change has to start much sooner in the industry’s process. I’m sort of out of things to say now, because I’m still so dumbstruck by the whole best picture fiasco . I’m exhausted and wired, like I just had too much wine (I did) and a little bump of something else (I didn’t). At the very least, this year’s ceremony was exciting, which you can’t always say about the Oscars. Exciting in a good way? I’m not sure, exactly. But in a time when the news cycle changes minute by alarming minute, this year’s Academy Awards—or at least their truly crazy conclusion—seemed to follow suit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T13:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T11:44:08.733+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
