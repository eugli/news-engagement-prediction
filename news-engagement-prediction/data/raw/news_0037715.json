This year, the fast food chain is launching a new version of the treat that layers the traditional mint flavor on top of chocolate. And in promotion of the new product, McDonald’s is also releasing a reinvented straw. \nAs Co.Design reports, the STRAW (Suction Tube for Reverse Axial Withdrawal) was designed by real engineers at the aerospace and robotics engineering firms JACE and NK Labs. What sets the device apart from conventional straws is the sharp bend in its shape and the three, eye-shaped holes in addition to the opening at the bottom end. The extra holes are positioned in a way that allows drinkers to take a sip that’s equal parts top mint layer and bottom chocolate layer. As the video below illustrates, it’s “a spectacularly unnecessary product.” \nA total of 2000 STRAWs, complete with fancy, black carrying cases, will be given out for free at McDonald’s in 80 cities . You have the next few weeks to snatch up yours if you don’t want to be stuck sipping milkshakes the old-fashioned way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T00:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T10:30:29.649+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
