Posted at 9:40 am on February 23, 2017 by Sam J. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nTwitter is all a flutter with outrage and mockery over the Trump administration doing away with the law that allowed transgendered folks to use whatever bathroom they wanted. Many realize the Feds really shouldn’t legislate such things in the first place, but others tried to make it an “equality” issue … like Chris Cuomo. \nHrm. \nInteresting. \nOf course he then deleted this tweet. Was it because he knew it was ridiculous considering there is an actual amendment regarding states’ rights or did he not want this harvard law grad to see him talking smack? \nEither way, tweets are forever. Trending Kellyanne Conway jokes at #CPAC2017: 'By tomorrow this will be TPAC' \nAnd dude, Cuomo is super riled up about this topic, his entire timeline this morning is about bathrooms: gender neutral bathrooms is a logical resolution, but that would mean equality for all and many opposed to xgender dont want that. be honest https://t.co/buB1BT8aVh \n— Christopher C. Cuomo (@ChrisCuomo) February 23, 2017 \nWhat? Honestly he should have deleted THIS one. @ChrisCuomo Just because YOU pee sitting down, doesn't mean there aren't actual men left in the world \n— Craig Daliessio (@craigdaliessio) February 23, 2017 . @ChrisCuomo No Chris, gender neutral bathrooms is a NYC/DC bubble solution. Most people think this is weird and you can judge accordingly \n— Dale Jackson (@TheDaleJackson) February 23, 2017 \nAnyone else confused why the Hell we’re legislating bathrooms? \nAnd we wonder why third world countries just shake their heads at us.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T17:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:19:32.733+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
