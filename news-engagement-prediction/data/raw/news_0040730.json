Netanyahu said from onstage, as the two leaders gave a brief press conference today.\n'He was never small, he was always big – he was always tall,' Netanyahu said of Kushner. 'But I've known the president and I've known his family and his team for a long time and there is no greater supporter of the Jewish people and the Jewish state than President Donald Trump.'\nKushner, who is Jewish, came up in the context of a question a reporter asked about increased reports of anti-Semitic incidents in the United States since Trump won the election.\nScroll down for video\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (left) talked to President Donald Trump (right) about how long he's known the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (left) suggested President Donald Trump (right) should not be blamed for rising antisemitism in the United States\nMAN OF THE HOUR: President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner (center) received praise from onstage from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\nWhen President Donald Trump was asked to respond to reports of rising antisemitism in the U.S., he brought up his Jewish son-in-law Jared Kushner (right) and his daughter Ivanka Trump (left), who converted to her husband's faith\nTrump eventually mentioned his Jewish family members when giving a response.\nHis eldest daughter Ivanka converted to the faith of her husband and all three of their children are being raised Jewish.\nFirst though, Trump, again, brought up his victory on Election Night, even though it's been more than three months since, and almost a month into his presidency.\n'Well, I just want to say we are very honored by the victory that we had,' Trump said. 'Three hundred and six Electoral College votes – we were not supposed to crack 220, you know that right?' Trump continued, turning toward Bibi.\nTrump reminded the crowd that political prognosticators didn't believe he could even get to 221 Electoral College votes, let alone the 270 needed to rout Democrat Hillary Clinton.\nFrom there, Trump pledged peace.\nJared Kushner (right) sat front row at a press conference today between his father-in-law President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Here he greets Netanyahu's wife Sara\n'We are going to stop crime in this country, we are going to do everything within our power to stop long-simmering racism,' he said. 'A lot of bad things have taken place over a long period of time.'\nWhile he spoke of the 'great enthusiasm' his election had on his base, Trump noted that not every American shared that sentiment.\n'I think one of the reasons why I won the election is we had a very, very, very divided country. Very divided,' Trump said. 'And hopefully, I'll be able to do something about that.'\nHe then more directly answered the reporter's question, about antisemitism, xenophobia and racism coming from his administration, by bringing up Jewish family members and friends.\n'As far as people, Jewish people, so many friends, a daughter that happens to be here right now,' Trump said, motioning to Ivanka in the audience. 'A son-in-law and three beautiful grandchildren,' he said of Kushner and their kids.\nTrump told the reporter 'you're going to see a lot different United States of America over the next three, four or eight years,' adding that a lot of 'good things' are happening.\n'You're going to see a lot of love, a lot of love, OK?' Trump promised.\nFrom here, Netanyahu stepped in with his own praise.\n'If I can respond to something that I know from personal experience,' the Israeli leader said. 'I've known President Trump for many years and to allude to him or to his people, his team, some of them I've known for many years too.'\nBibi then brought up his long-standing relationship with Kushner, who's been tasked with helping with Middle East peace, suggesting that there's no way these people could be responsible for the rising tide of antisemitism in the United States.\n'I think we should put that to rest,' Netanyahu said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T21:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T10:53:02.621+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
