Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view - NO FEDERAL FUNDS?\nThe protests erupted Wednesday night ahead of a speech Yiannopoulos was scheduled to make on campus. The Berkeley College Republicans reportedly invited Yiannopoulos' \"Dangerous Faggot\" speaking tour to campus, which had been scheduled to take place in the Martin Luther King Jr. Student Union.\nThe alt-right pundit has used his openly gay identity to discredit issues of homophobia in conservative politics. Yiannopolous has also spoken out against the Black Lives Matter movement and feminism, calling them \"cancerous and toxic to free expression.\"\nThe protests were nonviolent, initially. The arrival of around 150 masked anti-fascist black bloc protesters changed the atmosphere, students said. They shot fireworks at university police officers and pulled down metal barricades surrounding the student union, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. A fire was started outside of the building and police evacuated Yiannopoulos, before the event was called off altogether.\nIn his tweet, Trump falsely alleged that UC Berkeley infringed on the free speech of Yiannopoulos by canceling his event when violence broke out among some protesters. Trump also suggested that the university allowed Yiannopoulos' supporters to be attacked by his opponents — a claim that several students say isn't true, given that law enforcement used tear gas and rubber bullets to quell the violence.\nDemonstrators stand near a fire set at by violent protesters at U.C.

A university spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nUC Berkeley is charging $28,502 in tuition , fees and housing for the 2016-2017 academic year. For the next academic year, tuition and fees will increase by 2.5% , or $282. UC Board of Regents approved the tuition hike on Jan. 26, after having avoided doing so for six years.\nIman Sylvain, a 28-year-old PhD candidate in the school of biology, said her advanced studies have been largely supported by federal and state grants.\nProtesters hold up a banner during protests at UC Berkeley in California.

It would send a message, if he was allowed to defund our schools.\"\nMarcelo Garzo, a 33-year-old PhD candidate in the Department of Ethnic Studies, wondered if a cut in federal funding would cause the university to temporarily shut down.\n\"That would be devastating,\" Garzo said. \"But from my perspective, it would open up a really important dialogue on campus about how we would respond to that.\"\nStudents are pictured on the U.S. Berkeley campus. Source: Paul Sakuma/AP Many students are only able to attend UC Berkeley, which had been consistently ranked as a top public college, because of federal Pell grants, Cook said. \"If you cut that Pell grant, you just make student take out more loans,\" Cook said. \"Students are on the brink, especially millennials. We can't get 21st century jobs without further training. An extra $200 a semester — that's the difference between being in school and not being in school.\"\nCook concluded: \"That's why [Trump's tweet] is a dangerous sentiment.\"", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/827112633224544256&quot;", "http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/02/us/milo-yiannopoulos-ivory-tower/", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/827112633224544256", "http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Trump-update-Protest-at-UC-Berkeley-prompts-10902945.php", "http://financialaid.berkeley.edu/cost-attendance", "http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-uc-regents-tuition-hike-01262017-story.html"], "published": "2017-02-03T07:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T16:33:38.396+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
