'The wrong approach would be reducing sentences for serious crimes or letting people out early.' Community sentences can include unpaid work, or treatment programmes for drug addiction and mental health conditions. Ministry of Justice research shows community sentences are most effective when they tackle problems that contribute to the offender's crime. Miss Truss will add: 'Early intervention is not a 'nice to have' added extra to the justice system, it is vital if we are ever to break the cycle of crime, punishment and more crime.' DRUG-FUELLED INMATES 'HAVE TAKEN OVER JAIL' Prison officers have lost control of a major jail to its drug-fuelled inmates, according to an undercover investigation. It found prisoners high on drink or drugs, blocks left unsecured, and despair among officers too scared to intervene. The findings, broadcast by BBC 1’s Panorama tonight, are the latest in a series of revelations that show how prison officers are losing the fight to maintain order. Their inquiry into HMP Northumberland, a category C prison designed to hold 1,350 inmates, claims that the prisoners are effectively running the jail and that some are openly high on drink or drugs. Lost control: A prisoner high on drugs In one incident, a prison officer was filmed lying on the ground suffering a fit after being affected by a dangerous drug called Spice that inmates were smoking. The undercover reporter found widespread use of the newly-outlawed substance. Often smoked like cannabis, it is reputed to be stronger, and has been linked to severe psychotic episodes, hallucinations, and seizures. Adverse reactions to Spice there were said to happen ‘frequently’. One officer said there was ‘no discipline at all, we have lost control of the jail. Yes, they go behind the doors but they run the jail.’ The report comes as inmates at category A Wakefield jail, dubbed Monster Mansion, set up secret phone lines which allowed them to make cut-price calls to people on the outside – without jail staff listening in. Sodexo, the firm which runs HMP Northumberland, told Panorama: ‘We have not seen the footage but after viewing the programme we will of course investigate where necessary and take appropriate action.’ The Ministry of Justice said: ‘These are extremely serious allegations which are being urgently investigated.’ The speech, her first on sentencing since her appointment last summer, comes amid renewed concern about out-of-control jails in which prisoners have access to drink and drugs and prison officers struggle to keep order. This month's flagship Prisons and Courts Bill – dubbed the biggest shake-up of jails in a generation – will focus on reducing reoffending with a rehabilitation revolution, as well as tackling this spiralling jail violence and drug use. Miss Truss has secured an extra £104million a year, to be spent on funding 2,500 extra frontline prison officers, following years of complaints from the prison unions about dwindling numbers. She will also aim to distance the Government from Labour and shadow attorney general Shami Chakrabarti, who has demanded that the prison population be slashed. The Justice Secretary is to say that the rising prison numbers are 'right', because of an explosion in the number of people being sent to prison for the most heinous crimes. Speaking at the Centre For Social Justice think-tank, Miss Truss will say: 'What has actually happened is that the criminal justice system has got better at catching and convicting criminals who have perpetrated some of the most appalling crimes imaginable. Sentence lengths now better reflect the severity of crimes like domestic violence, rape and child abuse. 'It's not that the sum of human wickedness has doubled – it's that we have driven that wickedness out from the shadows and put it where it belongs, behind bars. 'The wrong approach would be reducing sentences for serious crimes or letting people out early. 'There are those in Labour who want to turn back the clock and cut the prison population to the size it was in 1990, at around 45,000. 'This would be reckless and endanger the public.'
