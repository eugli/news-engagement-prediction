The first American flag debuted in 1777. Historians debate if it was actually Betsy Ross who designed and sewed the original flag. The design had 13 stars and 13 stripes to represent the 13 colonies. The first American flag debuted in 1777, with 13 stars and 13 stripes The design the current flag is based on was authorized as the new official flag in 1795 after Vermont and Kentucky were added as states. It had 15 stars and 15 stripes. When Vermont and Kentucky joined the States, the flag was updated in 1795 Once it became clear that more territories in America wanted to become states, the design of the flag dropped back down to 13 stripes to represent the original colonies. Additional stars were added to represent the states. As more and more states became part of the country, the layout of the stars became stacked and layered. This always didn't prove to line up, in case with the 36th-star flag in 1865. It was made after Nevada was admitted as a state. One of the stranger layouts of the stars was in 1865 when there were 36 stars The current American flag was designed by high school student Robert G. Heft who gave the then-48 star flag an update for a history class assignment. President Eisenhower selected the 16-year-old's flag design after he mailed in his prototype to the White House and has been in use since 1960. The current flag has been flying since 1960 when Hawaii was admitted as a state ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T03:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:07:28.274+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
