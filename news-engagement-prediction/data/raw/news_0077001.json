Here is some very exciting lamb (Photo: Getty Images) Read More Tesco refuses to serve man buying £200 worth of food for homeless \nLamb is one of the more contentious issues when it comes to British food. Why, when we have such tender and succulent lamb here in the UK – particularly in Wales – do we fly it in from New Zealand? \nDavid Hughes spotted a lamb hotpot in Waitrose recently. On the packet, Waitrose proudly calls its dish 'British'. And they're right in a way – hotpot is one of our country's most hearty meals. But...the lamb is from New Zealand. It's a bit silly.

It's to do with the seasons. Lambs grow up, as you're probably aware. But shoppers want lamb year-round. \nStill, this is a bit of an error by Waitrose. \nWaitrose told Mirror Online : \"To ensure the provenance of the lamb in the meals is clearer (it has always been on back of pack) we have stickered all packs on the front. \n\"We are about to re-launch the range with the branding ‘Classic’, removing the large ‘British’ reference from the front of pack. \n\"This was only ever supposed to denote the origin of the recipe but we understand why confusion has arisen. In addition, we have challenged our supplier to explore the practicalities of using more British lamb in our ready meals. \n\"At the moment, because of our policy of only buying from our dedicated supply chain and using the whole carcass, we do not have sufficient raw material available to make this change but, nevertheless, we are exploring this option.\" Like us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T18:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T13:14:28.091+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
