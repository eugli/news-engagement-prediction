In this Dec. 4, 2013, file photo, U.S. Airways CEO Doug Parker responds to a reporters question during an interview at AMR headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas. AP \n“With the weather alone, I hope they see another level of commitment on our part to true up this merger and finally take care of their frontline employees,” Association of Professional Flight Attendants president Bob Ross said. “(Flight attendants) feel like they’re the last ones now on the property that haven’t been taken care of...We definitely have not been a priority in the overall plan.” \nThe pickets came shortly after the Allied Pilots Association, which represents 15,000 American pilots, said its leaders “have lost confidence in Doug Parker and his management team’s ability to successfully lead American Airlines.” \nThe union said the no confidence vote was triggered after Parker's decision to attend a company leadership conference rather than meet with President Donald Trump along with other airline CEOs last week. \n“Since the merger closed over three years ago, we have witnessed questionable economic and strategic decisions that have created gaps in the areas of customer satisfaction, operational performance, and revenue when compared to industry leader Delta,” union president Capt. Dan Carey said in a statement. \"Simply put, we've watched Mr. Parker and his team being out-managed by our competitors' executives and have lost trust in their ability to lead and protect the interests of American Airlines employees and shareholders.\" \nThe no confidence vote is largely symbolic, but taken with the flight attendants picket is a sign of simmering labor unrest three years after American closed its merger with support from its unions. \nAn American spokesman said the company has increased employee wages and benefits by $3.5 billion since the merger, with flight attendants receiving pay increases of 27 percent on average. \n\"We recognize pay is the most basic responsibility to our team, however, implementing the new joint contract between both legacy flight attendant workgroups will provide all of the benefits of our merger,\" spokesman Matt Miller said. \"We continue to work closely with the Association of Professional Flight Attendants to implement this new contract and fully realize all of the benefits of our merger for our flight attendant team.\" \nAs for the vote of no confidence, Miller said the company shares the pilot union's goal to create a \"phenomenal workplace\" that offers well-paying, lifelong careers. \n\"We have a solid foundation in place upon which to build and are pleased with the progress thus far,\" Miller said.
