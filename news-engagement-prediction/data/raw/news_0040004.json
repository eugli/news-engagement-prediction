What you're seeing on red carpets and in magazines takes a lot of effort and a lot of people. People don't understand that it's all very constructed. What little girls are seeing isn't what [these celebrities] look like when they wake up in the morning — even though it's no less beautiful.\" \nBlake also wants her two daughters ( James , 2, and Ines , 4 months) to grow up loving themselves for who they are, and not succumbing to the pressure to look a certain way. \nFurthermore, she wants them to understand exactly what goes on behind the scenes when the glam team is hard at work: \n\"There's this awareness of what [my daughters] are going to be exposed to and what they grow up seeing. For me, it's important for my daughters to know that it's not real life. They're seeing me dressed up in all this hair and makeup, but they also see me without that. I want them to see both sides, because there is never just one side.\" \nTrue! \nIt's commendable that the 29-year-old wants her children to see the world as it really is. Although, we have to say, Blake pretty much always looks like a knockout to us — even when fighting a shark! Ha! \nThoughts???", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T13:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:18:00.125+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
