I’m gonna punch one of y’all in y’all sh*t.” \nWhat. a. fucking. world. This 13-year-old (I REPEAT: 13-YEAR-OLD) chick goes on Dr Phil , acts like a lunatic and challenges the audience to a fight, gets her ass kicked by people on video , goes on another tirade that goes viral, and now she’s fucking famous! And her shtick is just threatening to beat people up and they yuk it up like it’s a catchphrase, her threatening to punch someone in the mouth is like when Bart Simpson was the “I Didn’t Do It” kid. It’s so surreal that she has paparazzi chasing her down because she acted like a HUGE fucking asshole on an awful daytime show but this is what the world is now, gotta just accept it. \nAnd the thing is that I don’t hate her for it. Before she went viral, she was a trashbag fuck up teen en route to an awful life of god knows what. But now maybe she’s sort of got a shot to improve? I mean there’s still at least a 50 percent chance she stabs someone after all the attention gets to her and she lashes out like King Kong being shown off on a stage but it seems like she’s at least got a shot at a better life outcome than before? \nOh who am I kidding she’ll probably be in jail by the time her next Dr Phil episode airs. She may even keep upping the ante to keep the attention going, that’s how these things go. Enjoy the ride of your threatened violence entertaining the masses while it lasts, kid.
