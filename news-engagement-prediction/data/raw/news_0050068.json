Then slowly, like Katharine Ross in Stepford Wives , she begins to realise something is terribly wrong with the (American) dream.\nAdhering to Katy's new mantra of \"purposeful pop\", it's political without being polemic. Here are some of the key moments from the video, which you can watch in full on YouTube .\nSCENE ONE: A theme park, daytime The futuristic theme park (actually Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, California) is a metaphor for the infinite distractions of modern society - but in case that was too subtle, it has been renamed \"Oblivia\".\nThe guests are all taking selfies, eating child-sized sticks of candy floss and crowding around a sign for \"the greatest ride in the universe\".\nEverywhere you look, there are signs, icons and statues of a hamster. This will be important later.\nThe song's lyrics depict a world of repetition and ignorance, where technology renders us oblivious to people's real problems.\n\" Are we crazy? / Living our lives through a lens / Trapped in our white picket fence / Like ornaments / So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble / So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble \".\nAt first, Katy is awestruck, just like the other guests. But when she pricks her finger on a rose, there's a hint of trouble in paradise.\nSCENE TWO: Roller coaster rodeo Kudos to Katy, who manages to lip-sync her single perfectly while experiencing a G-force of 4.9 on a roller coaster.\nFact fans: The ride she's on is The New Revolution, the world's first vertical loop coaster, which featured in the final scenes of cult comedy National Lampoon's Vacation .\nSCENE THREE: Something sinister is afoot As Katy loops the loop, we see another ride, which hoists tiny suburban houses towards the sky.\nSuddenly, it malfunctions, and the houses plummet to the ground. A metaphor, perhaps, for the US housing crisis, where reckless lending left thousands of people homeless.\nMeanwhile, hundreds of people are joyfully queuing for that hamster ride...\nSCENE FOUR: The Big Reveal The \"greatest ride in the universe\" turns out to be a treadmill. The guests aren't there to have fun - they're assets. Cogs in the machine. Literally hamsters on a wheel.\n#SATIRE\nThis image, coincidentally, makes sense of Chained To The Rhythm's lyric video , which saw Katy Perry cooking her pet hamster a hamburger. (We're applying a deliberately loose interpretation of the phrase \"makes sense of\" here.)\nSCENE FIVE: \"Inferno water\" The next scene takes place at a petrol station, where Katy is whisked off her feet by men in sailor costumes (she might be making a serious political point but, hey, this is still a Katy Perry video).\nThe pumps are supplying \"inferno water\" - a reference to the West's dependency on oil; but also to the looming crisis over the world's water supply , which some experts believe could lead to a war in Asia.\nSCENE SIX: She's wide awake As she sits down to watch a 3D movie, Katy notices a disturbing homogeneity amongst her fellow park guests who are, by now moving entirely in unison.\nHer feelings are amplified by Skip Marley's guest verse - already the song's most stringently political moment - as he raps: \" Break down the walls to connect, inspire / Up in your high place, liars / Time is ticking for the empire / And we're about to riot / they woke up, they woke up the lions \".\nAs Skip reaches out to her, Katy's conversion is complete.\nShe sings a panic-stricken final chorus, the lyric \"stumbling around like a wasted zombie\" writ large, with Katy trapped in the middle of a mindless dance routine.\nIn the closing scene, she turns to make eye contact with the camera, tacitly issuing a challenge to us, the viewer.\nAre we comfortable with unquestioning conformity? Or will we join her big pop revolution?\nAlso, could we please buy a copy of her new album, title TBC?\nAll told, the video is quite a turnaround for the artist who began her career with a morally-questionable song called U R So Gay; but fans knew this was coming.\nKaty was one of Hilary Clinton's highest-profile supporters last year, and delayed her fourth album in the wake of Donald Trump's US election victory, saying she wanted to address the political upheaval in her music.\n\"It's funny, sometimes people who disagree with me just say, 'Shut up and sing,'\" she wrote. \"Boy, will I do so in a whole new way.\n\"Hell hath no fury like a woman REBORN.\"\nAt last week's Grammys, she performed the first verse trapped behind a picket fence, before bursting forward in a white pant suit (Hilary Clinton must have been so proud), and joining hands with Skip Marley in front of a projection of the US constitution.\nAnd while her message might be politically naive, it's commendable to see such a mainstream star prompting listeners to be more contemplative and engaged.\nAs a pop artist, it could cost her sales - but at least she's putting her money where her mouth is.\nKaty Perry will be the special guest on Nick Grimshaw's BBC Radio 1 Breakfast Show on Wednesday, 22 February.\nFollow us on Facebook , on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts , or on Instagram at bbcnewsents .
