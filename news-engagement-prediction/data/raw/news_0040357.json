Section 5 of the Drugs Act penalizes the \"sale, trading, administration, dispensation, delivery, distribution and transportation\" of illegal drugs. \nViolators face 12 years to life imprisonment and fines ranging from P500,000 to P10 million. \nJustice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II earlier said they will file the charges before a regular court instead of the Office of the Ombudsman because the crime – involvement in illegal drugs – is not related to her office. \nDe Lima said on February 13 that she was expecting an arrest warrant \"soon\" and that she is prepared for the worst case scenario. \nIt is still unclear whether De Lima will have the right to bail, but under criminal procedures, \"no person charged with an offense punishable by life imprisonment shall be admitted to bail regardless of the stage of the criminal prosecution.\" \nApart from a consolidated drug complaint filed by the Volunteers against Crime and Corruption, the National Bureau of Investigation, former NBI deputy directors Reynaldo Esmeralda and Ruel Lasala, and inmate Jaybee Sebastian, De Lima is also facing also facing charges of indirect bribery and violation of the anti-graft law. \nDe Lima has asked the Court of Appeals to stop the DOJ's investigation, saying the jurisdiction falls with the Office of the Ombudsman since she is an elected the official. \nOn the eve of the filing of criminal charges, the Senate leadership said they cannot stop the arrest but will ensure the warrant would not be served inside the session hall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T13:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T08:41:23.461+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
