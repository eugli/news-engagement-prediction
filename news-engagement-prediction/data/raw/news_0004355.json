This compliation video shows a handful of kids who love to bicker with their dads, and they don't really know why they're arguing in the first place! From stomping to intense negotiations, to finger wagging and more, these kids and their dads are too cute to handle!\nEven though these little ones are too young to realize what they're saying, Parents Magazine explains that a adult's response must be perfect. \"'It's very important that you model the behavior you expect from your child. Children learn by imitating what they see, especially at home,' says Gail Gross, Ph.D., Ed.D., a family psychologist in Houston. 'If your 5-year-old overhears you using a snarky tone when speaking to your spouse or your mother-in-law, she will learn it's okay to treat others (including you) in a similar manner.'\" That means if you respond to your toddler's arguing with sass, threats or yelling, they will mimic that behavior as soon as they're old enough to really argue!\nEven though these kids aren't exactly sure as to what the problem is, boy, do they love to carry on the fight! One day they'll look back at this video and see just how spirited they were as a toddler! Take a peek at this cute video for yourself by pressing \"play\" below - and if this reminds you of your own child, be sure to tag them in the Facebook comments section!
