I pardon my husband and hope he will also join us soon to live with us here in Pakistan,” she told AFP. \nMr. Tantray was among thousands who crossed the de facto border into Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir while an insurgency was at its peak in the Indian sector. He later married Ms. Kiani, but wanted the family to return to his home village following the birth of their son. When Ms. Kiani refused, Mr. Tantray absconded with the child last March. \nMs. Kiani pursued a custody case in an Indian court through the Pakistani embassy in New Delhi, and the court ruled in her favour. \nBasit tweets thanks \n“We are thankful to Indian authorities for their cooperation in this humanitarian matter,” Pakistan’s High Commissioner Abdul Basit tweeted. \nMs. Kiani also thanked both governments, and urged them to come together to find a lasting solution to the Kashmir conflict. \n“Thousands of people are suffering from grief and sorrow because of this dispute. The Kashmir issue must be solved to end problems of people living on both sides of Kashmir,”\\ she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T16:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T11:59:16.278+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
