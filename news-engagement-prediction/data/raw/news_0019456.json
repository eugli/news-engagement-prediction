Save Intel Corporation \nIntel plans to complete Fab 42, a semiconductor factory in Chandler, Arizona, with an investment of more than $7 billion over the next three to four years. At its peak, the factory will employ about 3,000 process engineers, equipment technicians, and facilities-support engineers and technicians. Fab 42 will produce 7 nanometer chips and is \"expected to be the most advanced semiconductor factory in the world\" -- whatever that means. \nAs noted by New York Times technology reporter Farhad Manjoo and others on Twitter, Intel's investment in Fab 42 wasn't the result of new federal subsidies or credits. However, the company chose to announce the move at the White House, where cameras captured Intel CEO Brian Krzanich offering President Donald Trump a gift and explaining how regulatory US tax policies have \"disadvantaged\" his business in the past. Thank you Brian Krzanich, CEO of @Intel . A great investment ($7 BILLION) in American INNOVATION and JOBS! #AmericaFirst ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ pic.twitter.com/76lAiSSQ1l â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 \nIntel isn't alone in using the president as a way to generate media interest in an existing business deal. In December, Trump gave Sprint a signal boost when he congratulated the company on its decision to bring 5,000 jobs to the United States . Despite Trump's attempts to take credit for the deal, it was in fact put together months before he was elected. \nIntel also isn't the only tech company making moves in Arizona -- most recently, Uber moved its fleet of custom, self-driving Volvo XC90 SUVs to the state after a tiff with the California Department of Motor Vehicles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T06:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:52:56.109+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
