Among Liberal/National voters 28% believe the development is bad for the party and 23% good.\nThe data also indicates a number of voters haven’t yet got their head around the change, with 29% unable to rate the development as either good or bad, and 28% saying they didn’t know.\nThe latest poll has Labor leading the Turnbull government on the two-party-preferred measure by 52% to 48%, which compares with Newspoll’s snapshot last week where Labor led 54% to 46% on a two-party-preferred basis .\ntwo party preferred While Labor is leading on the head to head, the poll also underscores profound voter dissatisfaction with both Turnbull and Shorten.\nThe data shows 34% (down 3% from four weeks ago) of respondents approved of the job Turnbull is doing as prime minister and 49% (up 1%) disapprove – a change in the prime minister’s net approval rating from -11 to -15.\napproval rating That result is Turnbull’s worst net rating as prime minister.\nShorten’s approval rating also dived seven points in four weeks. His approval rating in the latest poll is 30%, and 47% of voters disapproved, which represents a change in his net rating from -7 to -17.\nThis is Shorten’s worst net rating since March 2016.\nTurnbull still leads Shorten on the poll’s better prime minister measure, with 39% of respondents nominating Turnbull as the better prime minister compared with 25% who back Shorten.\nCory Bernardi says his new party 'will give hope to those who despair' at politics Read more \nThe Guardian Essential Report measure compares with Newspoll’s preferred prime minister measure, where Turnbull remains clearly in front of Shorten as preferred prime minister, with his support rising one point to 42% while the Labor leader fell two to 30%.\nThe thumbs down follows the resumption of parliament for 2017, which has quickly descended into partisan brawling about energy, childcare and company tax, as well as a personal face-off between Turnbull and Shorten last week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T08:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T06:04:45.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
