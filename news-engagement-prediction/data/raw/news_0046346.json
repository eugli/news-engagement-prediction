Exciting Right? It has been officially confirmed that director Bala will be doing a film with Jyothika in the lead role. The film will be produced by Bala's B Studios along with Eon Studios. After 'Tharai Thappattai' which released in January 2016, Bala has not started his next film till now. He was supposed to start a film based on Tamil a novel written by Vela Ramamurthy with a bunch of leading young actors but project has been reportedly put off now. This will be the first time Bala and Jo will be teaming up and we can certainly expect magic on screen. A leading hero is expected to play the male lead in this film and the official announcement about the same can be expected soon. Jyothika who made a comeback with the critically acclaimed hit flick '36 Vayathiniley' in 2015 has completed shooting for director Bramma's 'Magalir Mattum' which is due for release soon. The shooting of the film will commence on March 1, 2016 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T15:26:23.149+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
