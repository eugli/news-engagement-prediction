He’s just recently started putting it all together for Manchester United on the pitch, but he’s in top form off of it. \nAt an open training session for the Red Devils, the 23-year-old Frenchman was tasked with shooting a ball at a gigantic inflatable dart board. He nailed the bullseye. \n— Manchester United (@ManUtd) February 9, 2017 \nWipe those hands clean, Paul. You’re done for the day. As accurate as Pobga was on the dart board (side note: I need one), he’s had some bad luck when it comes to matches. In the Premier League alone, Pogba has hit the woodwork five times. That’s second only to Man City’s Kevin de Bruyne, who’s hit it six times. \nPogba’s tough luck with the woodwork wouldn’t be as unfortunate if he were still finding the inside of the uprights and crossbar, but he’s managed just four goals on the season. Still, he’s one of the biggest talents on the planet and an adjustment period is warranted. \nMaybe he could just visualize a bullseye next time he’s firing off a shot?
