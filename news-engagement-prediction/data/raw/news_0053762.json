Eric Berry   10:23 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 10:23 a.m. ET \nEric Berry during his seven-year NFL career has overcome a torn ACL that cost him the 2011 season. He fought back from a cancer diagnosis late in the 2014 season and earned Comeback Player of the Year in 2015. He's a five-time Pro Bowler and has been named first team All-Pro the past two years. He's beloved by his Chiefs teammates and the Kansas City fan base. \nYet, thus far, he has been unable to convince the Chiefs to step up and sign him to a long-term deal. \nInstead, for the second straight offseason, Berry is hearing the dreaded F word — as in franchise tag . After playing under the franchise tender in 2016, Berry has stated publicly that if the Chiefs tag him again and don't consummate a long-term deal by the July 15 deadline, he will not play for them in 2017. \nThe Chiefs know how important Berry is to their team. If they fail to sign him to a fair market deal, it will send a bad message to the rest of the locker room about whether the team will pony up for a player once he proves himself. \nMORE: Top franchise tag candidates in 2017 \nThe tag is an odd plight for players, as they're highly compensated but only guaranteed for one season. Berry, with the tag looming for a second straight year, is in the same boat as Washington quarterback Kirk Cousins . Both players surely find it hard to understand why they can't get long-term deals at market value. \nHard feelings invariably fester as these situations unfold. At this juncture of their somewhat shaky relationship with Berry, the Chiefs simply need to follow the superstar theory. \nDuring my early NFL management years, when I was as an assistant GM with the Vikings, our GM Mike Lynn often preached to me the necessity of keeping our very best players. Those players included Hall of Famers such as Fran Tarkenton and Alan Page, along with Pro Bowlers such as Chuck Foreman and Anthony Carter. The contract battles could be fierce, but the team held the greater leverage in those pre-free agency years, so the deals eventually got done. \nAs I took over as Vikings GM and the free agency/salary cap era emerged, it became more difficult to retain star players. I was able to re-sign Hall of Famers Cris Carter, Randall McDaniel, Chris Doleman and John Randle, but we eventually had to trade Doleman and Hall of Fame tackle Gary Zimmerman after contract disputes. While I couldn't keep every star player, the hammer of the franchise tag was a good tool that helped me in my negotiations. \nToday's negotiations with franchise-tagged players (or those with the threat of being tagged) are similar to the pre-free agency negotiations with star players. The team holds the leverage. \nSuch players basically are left with no alternatives but to hold out, as Berry did throughout the offseason program and into training camp last year after the deadline came and went without a long-term deal. He finally signed his franchise tender and reported Aug. 29 so he would receive his entire $10.8 million salary with no fines. He's threatening to take a different course of action this year. \nREPORT: No momentum on deal for Berry \nKansas City brass — owner Clark Hunt, general manager John Dorsey and coach Andy Reid — might feel Berry's health resume makes him a risky player to sign to a contract befitting one of the best (if not the best) safeties in the game. And since recent big contracts for Dwayne Bowe and Justin Houston have not panned out, the Chiefs might be overly cautious with such deals. \nThe Chiefs also have salary cap issues , as they're basically right at the projected cap of $168 million. The good news is they have several viable options to create cap room via releases or pay cuts with players such as Jamaal Charles, overpaid backup quarterback Nick Foles and aging linebacker Derrick Johnson. \nOnce the Chiefs make their cap casualty cuts, it makes sense for them to step up and pay Berry his market value, which is in the range of $12.5 million per year with approximately $30 million-$40 million in guarantees. \nBerry and his agent surely are focused on Tyrann Mathieu's deal with the Cardinals signed last year — five years, $62.5 million, $15.5 million signing bonus and $40 million guaranteed with a first-year cap number of $4.3 million. \nA similar deal for Berry would significantly cut his cap hit, which was $10.8 million last year. If Berry were to be tagged again, that hit would jump by a mandated 20 percent to $12.96 million. The Chiefs could use that extra $8 million or so to add more quality players on both sides of the ball. \nAnother benefit to signing Berry to a long-term deal before the March 1 franchise tag deadline: The Chiefs would then have the option of placing their franchise tag on two-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Dontari Poe, who otherwise would hit free agency on March 9. \nMORE: Top NFL free agents by position \nBerry is far too important of a player for the Chiefs to let hit the market. Other teams will see him as a safety who can do it all — play in the box as an excellent run supporter, cover the best tight ends man-to-man and play outstanding zone coverage, short and deep. \nHis hometown Falcons, who will remember getting gashed by Brady and Co. in the Super Bowl, also will recall Berry's heroics in Kansas City’s thrilling road victory over Atlanta in December. Another suitor could be the Titans, who have a secondary in need of playmakers and $68 million of cap room. Berry played college football at Tennessee, so he has a connection to the area. \nIn terms of possible concerns about Berry's long-term health, the Chiefs’ hierarchy must trust the expert opinions of their team doctors. If Hunt, Dorsey and Reid receive a positive prognosis for Berry's future health, they should go ahead and lock him up for the long haul. \nThat's what teams have to try to do with their superstars, and Berry clearly qualifies as such a player in Kansas City. \nJeff Diamond is the former president of the Titans and the former vice president/general manager of the Vikings.
