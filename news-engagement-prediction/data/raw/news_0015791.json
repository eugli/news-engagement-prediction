He asked, “as an American, if I went out in town right now, would I be welcome?” They answered: \n“Absolutely not, you would not be welcome.” \nWhen asked, “What would happen if I went in town?” The Iraqis provided him a horrifying reality check: Locals would snatch him up Torture him Kill him within an hour – probably a beheading It would be filmed for everyone to see \nGern highlighted that this isn’t ISIS or al-Qaeda making these claims; it’s the local populace. This led him to his final question: \n“If you would do this to me, in your country, why would I let you in my country?” \nHis video’s purpose was to inform Americans about what’s taking place in one of the seven “banned countries” highlighted in President Trump’s executive order. \nBy the next day, Gern’s video had garnered over 35 million views, according to the Daily Wire. \nThen the viral video was taken down by YouTube for violating “hate speech” rules . \nHe has now reposted it (above), but it is unclear if the website’s liberal Google masters will censor it again. \nAfter all, his inconvenient truths are way too much reality for Trump-hating liberals to handle. YouTube and Google are CENSORING this Marine’s video…PLEASE SHARE it on Facebook and Twitter to spread the TRUTH…", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T11:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T06:12:48.634+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
