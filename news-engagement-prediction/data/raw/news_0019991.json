(ChinaFotoPress/ChinaFotoPress via Getty Images) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Friday, February 10, 2017, 5:59 PM \nALBANY — It only took a dozen years, but the State of New York has finally resolved its case with former AIG chairman Hank Greenberg. \nAttorney General Eric Schneiderman announced Friday afternoon that Greenberg will pay $9 million as part of a settlement that brings to a closed case first brought by then-Attorney General Eliot Spitzer in 2005. \n“Today's agreement settles the indisputable fact that Mr. Greenberg has denied for twelve years: that Mr. Greenberg orchestrated two transactions that fundamentally misrepresented AIG's finances,” Schneiderman said in a statement. \nAs part of the settlement, Howard Smith, AIG's former Chief Financial Officer, will also pay $900,000 for his role in two fraudulent reinsurance transactions that were at the heart of the case. Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced on Friday, Feb. 2, 2017 that Greenberg will pay a $9 million settlement to close the fraud case after 12 years.

AIG settled the case in 2006, paying $1.6 billion to the state. \nGreenberg repeatedly denied the allegations and continued to fight the case through two successive attorneys general. \nAfter a series of legal challenges brought by Greenberg’s legal team, the case finally went to trial last fall but the proceedings were recessed to allow time for both sides to negotiate a settlement with mediators Kenneth Feinberg and Camille Biros. Greenberg has managed to deny fraud allegations for 12 years and rotate through two attorney generals.
