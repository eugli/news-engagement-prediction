Charges against the pair were dropped at court after an outcry among campaigners. \nNatalie Bennett , the former Green party leader planning to stand for election in Sheffield Central, welcomed the CPS decision but called for the Rev Dr Alan Billings, the South Yorkshire police and crime commissioner, to investigate the arrests.

This sensible decision is to be applauded.” \nBennett added: “The police and crime commissioner must now look into how the police came to take this clearly unwise, and possibly illegal, action. \n“It leaves the council in a position where it really has no alternative but to put the tree-felling programme on hold and to entirely rethink the management of street trees. \n“The council and private sector company Amey have been acting without the consent of the community, and if they continue to try to do that they are going to continue to encounter peaceful, clearly lawful, resistance.” \nCrump, a member of Sheffield Green party, also welcomed the CPS decision, which he said “affirms our right to peaceful protest”. \nHis partner, the Green party councillor Alison Teal, was arrested along with six others earlier this month while trying to prevent trees from being chopped down in Chippinghouse road, Nether Edge. \nCrump added: “It is frightening to be caught up in a situation where a powerful multinational corporation appears to have South Yorkshire police on speed dial. \n“I thought the job of the police was to keep the community safe, not to lock them up because they’re slowing down profit reaping.” \nThe fight for Sheffield’s trees has its roots in a £2bn PFI deal signed by the Labour-run council in 2012. The contractor Amey is tasked with maintaining the city’s 36,000 roadside trees as part of a road maintenance agreement. \nThe council said it has removed fewer than 1% of the 4m trees across the city and that those chopped down were deemed “dangerous, dead, dying or diseased”.
