I thought it was very innocent.\n“I got out of the pool and didn’t think it was that serious. It was just a scrape, it wasn’t a deep cut. It was fairly innocuous.”\nMORE: Bride, 35, buried under rubble after Cuban wedding hotel roof collapses during rehearsal\nMORE: Sugar levels ‘still too high’ in children’s cereals despite reduction of salt\nStewart put antiseptic cream on the open wound and thought nothing more of it until two days later when he came down with a fever during a romantic meal with Sarah and collapsed in their hotel room.\nDespite his condition he said he felt well enough to board the flight home two days later, taking paracetamol to ease the pain.\nView photos\nAmputation – doctors said they had no choice but to remove Stewart’s little toe and part of his foot More But on board, he began to vomit and have what his wife thought was some sort of seizure.\nThe couple say Stewart had to be given oxygen during the flight and part of the medical equipment indicated he had a major infection.\nBack at home he was treated at various hospitals, resulting in doctors saying they had no option but to amputate his little toe and part of his left foot.\nStewart added: “I’ve now lost my job through all this. The experience has affected us massively and we don’t want to fly anymore. There is still a chance I could lose my foot.”\nView photos\nUpset – the couple feel they have been robbed of their love of holidays More Sarah said: We have always loved our holidays, that’s what we work so hard for but I feel like we have had that taken away from us.\nThe couple are now planning to take legal action.\nBritish Airways said: “We are very sorry to hear that Mr Vine has been so unwell following his injury and are speaking to him while we investigate his concerns.”\nThe Jolly Beach Hotel has been contacted for comment.", "external_links": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/MJP45K73uO23eb8dUgNbYw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9OTky/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/529bede4fc84c68df271394f52553d43", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ONXzCpjHeuRs37Mib_F8YA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9OTk0/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/9cc9e7008082e07c2603cdeae7b45e6b", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dx5Mk5_pVkFgKOGfU0pt_A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9OTky/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/c19387702b2627e67c18b9de54331bd3);", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dx5Mk5_pVkFgKOGfU0pt_A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9OTky/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/c19387702b2627e67c18b9de54331bd3", "https://s.yimg.com/dh/ap/default/150604/orb.png);", "https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/HgiBTpjv4p2tZQRYzWMxKw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9NDk1/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/6095d7329329a63496fdf7d1e91b7e12", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ONXzCpjHeuRs37Mib_F8YA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9OTk0/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/9cc9e7008082e07c2603cdeae7b45e6b);", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/MJP45K73uO23eb8dUgNbYw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9OTky/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/529bede4fc84c68df271394f52553d43);"], "published": "2017-02-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T14:41:52.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
