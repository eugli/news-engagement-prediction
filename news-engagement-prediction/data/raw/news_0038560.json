The technology, described in a filing made public Tuesday by the US Patent and Trade Office, could replace the physical home button that's traditionally occupied the space below the iPhone's screen. \nEver since Apple co-founder Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone in 2007, the round home button has been a focal point for navigating the gadget. But rumors of its demise began to swirl in 2013, when Apple introduced Touch ID, a fingerprint security sensor that allowed users of its iPhone 5S to bypass typing in a password. The Touch ID sensor is built into the home button today. \nThat speculation only increased in 2015, when Apple filed a patent application to move the fingerprint sensor beneath the glass of the touchscreen , eliminating the need for a home button. \nAs Apple marks the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone , the rumor mill is being fed by reports about big hardware changes expected on the next-generation phone many are calling the iPhone 8 . The elimination of a physical home button is one of the rumored changes, as is a glass and steel body with a curved edge display ; wireless charging ; and even using an iris scanner as one way to unlock the device. \nApple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. \nDoes the Mac still matter? Apple execs tell why the MacBook Pro was over four years in the making, and why we should care. \nBatteries Not Included : The CNET team shares experiences that remind us why tech stuff is cool.
