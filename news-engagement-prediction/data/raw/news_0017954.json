'As soon as she was born she was popped in a see-through trash bag, so her organs weren’t exposed to air. Sufferers of the condition are born with parts of their body protruding outside their abdominal wall, after they fail to develop properly in the womb (pictured with her mother, Mary, 24, and father, William, 27, shortly after her first operation) Surgeons performed a two-hour operation on her immediately to push some of her organs back in - but not all would fit (pictured after she was discharged three weeks later) 'Before I even had a chance to hold her, she was whisked for surgery.' Her husband, William, 27, went with his new daughter to the operating theatre - later describing her to his wife. As soon as she was born she was popped in a see-through trash bag, so her organs weren’t exposed to air. Mary Sargent During the two-hour operation, while Mrs Sargent was delivering the placenta and being taken to labour recovery, Elliotte was having her organs pushed back in. But not all of them would fit, so those left exposed were covered in a plastic bag. Over the next 12 days, the baby’s bag was gradually shortened, as gravity took hold and her organs worked their way naturally back into her tiny, newborn body. On the 8th day, Elliotte underwent surgery to have the hole in her stomach stitched back up. 'Then, finally, I got to hold her,' Mrs Sargent added. 'It was an awesome moment. Completely wonderful.' But it was not until day 19 that Elliotte was able to eat. After spending her first 63 days in hospital, the four-month-old is now fighting fit (pictured when she was just five days old) 'She’s my miracle,' Mrs Sargent said. 'I wouldn’t be without her' (pictured at three days old) 'Before then she’d been PICC line-fed,' she said. 'Seeing her drink my breast-milk was very emotional.' WHAT IS GASTROSCHISIS? Gastroschisis is a type of abdominal wall defect. It occurs when a child's abdomen does not develop fully while in the womb. In gastroschisis, the abdominal wall does not form completely so the intestines develop outside and are open to the air when the child is born. Some areas of the intestines may look darker as they have been in contact with the amniotic fluid inside the womb, which can damage them. It is not known exactly what causes gastroschisis although it is becoming more common, particularly in younger mothers under the age of 20 years. Overall the incidence is quite low with 1 in 3000 babies being born with gastroschisis each year. Source: Great Ormond Street Hospital She was discharged shortly after, weighing 8lbs. Now, although she still has regular check-ups, she is recovering well and is unlikely to need further surgery. 'She’s my miracle,' Mrs Sargent said. 'I wouldn’t be without her.' A spokesperson for London’s Great Ormond Street Hospital said: 'Gastroschisis is a type of abdominal wall defect. It occurs when a child’s abdomen does not develop fully while in the womb. 'Early in all pregnancies, the intestine develops inside the umbilical cord and then usually moves inside the abdomen a few weeks later. 'In gastroschisis, the abdominal wall does not form completely, so the intestines develop outside and are open to the air when the child is born. 'We do not know exactly what causes gastroschisis, although we do know that they are becoming more common, particularly in younger mothers under the age of 20 years. 'However, overall the incidence is quite low, with 1 in 3,000 babies being born with gastroschisis each year.'
