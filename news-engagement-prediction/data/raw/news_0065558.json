MONTEGRANDE \nMalacañang issued on Wednesday the formal order approving the P1,000 increase in the monthly Social Security System pension. \nThe memorandum, signed by Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea, was sent to SSS Chair Amado Valdez. \n“Upon representations made by the SSS, and subject to existing laws, rules and regulations, please be informed that the P1,000 increase in benefits of qualified SSS retirees, survivors, and permanently disabled pensioners effective January 2017, has been approved,” the memo said. ADVERTISEMENT \nThe increase is retroactive. Pensioners will receive the January and February differentials in March, according to SSS President Emmanuel Dooc. \nBeginning April, the increase will be incorporated in the regular monthly pension, Dooc said. \nPresident Rodrigo Duterte gave the go-signal for the P1,000 monthly pension increase last month amid misgivings from his economic managers, who were concerned about the viability of the SSS fund. \nAlong with the pension hike, the President also approved a 1.5-percentage point increase in members’ contributions effective May 2017. \nHe also approved the increase in the maximum monthly salary credit, from P16,000 to P20,000, on which the monthly premium is based. \nPensioners and their advocates had sought a P2,000 across-the-board monthly increase, a proposal Mr. Duterte endorsed during the presidential campaign last year. \nBut his administration’s economic managers bucked the idea, saying it would cut the actuarial life of the pension fund by 14 to 17 years. \nMr. Duterte eventually approved a P1,000 monthly increase effective Jan. 17. \nAnother P1,000 increase may be given in 2022.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:15:46.950+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
