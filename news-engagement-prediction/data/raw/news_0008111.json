IFAB are set to meet on March 3 at Wembley and the idea of temporary dismissals have been placed on the agenda which was confirmed on Wednesday. Other topics due for review include the role of the captain in each team, with a view to creating a single channel of communication between a squad and the match officials during the game, much like in rugby union. The rule making committee for football IFAB will consider introducing sin bins at the next AGM IFAB published the agenda for their upcoming meet online, which read: 'As part of “Modifications”, the proposal to allow temporary dismissals (sin bins) for yellow card offences will be considered following tests in UEFA’s development competitions over the last three years.' Football's rule-making body sought to clarify after the release that, if the law were passed, it would only be rolled out across youth, senior and amateur levels of the game, but BBC's Richard Conway suggests it could still be seen in the professional game within a few years. Sin bins have been a successful disciplinary tool in both rugby union and hockey, and the idea has advocates within football, such as Marco van Basten . IFAB are also set to discuss the 'role of the captain' and proposals to enhance their role as a spokesman on the field. 'Particular focus will be given to the role of the captain,' reads the agenda, 'and how her/his responsibilities could be enhanced as part of a move to improve on-field discipline and create better communication between players and match officials.' IFAB want to establish rules to prevent future scenes of players surrounding match officials RELATED ARTICLES ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T18:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T13:22:29.717+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
