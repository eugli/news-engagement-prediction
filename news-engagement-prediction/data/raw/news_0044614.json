(Courtesy of Simon Fraser University/Allison Carter)\nCarter said the research was, in part, inspired by her own experiences.\n\"I was part of that statistic. I was noticing the effects that it was having on my own self-esteem and sense of worth,\" she said.\nCarter said that since conducting the research, she has \"completely changed\" the ways she engages online, by unfollowing social media accounts that trigger negative thoughts and reducing the leisure hours she spends on the internet.\n'What defines female worth' Carter said that while reducing screen time may be part of a solution, the overall conversation around women's bodies needs to change.\n\"We need to be talking with girls and young women about how to engage online in ways that are positive and meaningful,\" she said.\n\"I think the bigger issue that we need to be talking about is what defines female worth — we need to move beyond what appears on the outside and reclaim what defines who we are as women.\"\nMiss Universe Canada Siera Bearchell using 'self-love' to fight Instagram body-shamers\n​'I will fight for the right to be you': Lizzo on body positivity and activism\nResults for men and boys differ The research also included a sub analysis that looked at the internet use and self-image of boys and young men of the same ages.\nThe Statistics Canada data found that relative to their female counterparts, men reported lower body dissatisfaction and much higher internet use.\nCarter said this suggests that there may be a gendered aspect to the phenomenon.\n\"Certainly, more research among diverse populations across age, gender, ethnicity is needed,\" she said.\nCarter's research was the first nationally representative study evaluating the relationship between internet use and body dissatisfaction among girls and young women in Canada.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T00:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:17:18.114+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
