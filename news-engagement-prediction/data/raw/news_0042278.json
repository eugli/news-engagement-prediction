It's been the Ritz for 80 years and it is so well known under this name. 'It's not like we've ever had anyone turning up here thinking they should be at The Ritz in London. It's absolutely ridiculous and we are really shocked and upset. 'We've taken legal advice but things don't look good for us at the moment - we don't know which direction to turn.' Upset: Owner Glenn Smith was devastated to receive a letter from The Ritz's solicitors demanding his business change its name or face a legal fight The Ritz in Brighouse, known as liveattheritz.com, started as The Ritz cinema in 1937. The cinema closed in 1963 but reopened as a bingo hall in 1965. The venue was then bought and renovated as a dance hall in 1981 before being taken over again in 1987 by a couple who had it for 27 years. They had tried to sell it before for it to be made into retirement homes but Calderdale Council refused permission to do so. Instead Mr Smith bought it up in 2014 and its musical history continued. He added to its popular dance following - the venue boasts a sprung Canadian maple floor loved by its Tamla, Motown, soul, funk, northern soul, rock 'n' roll and ballroom following - by introducing live bands to its repertoire. It has been voted the best northern soul venue in the north and previous performers include tribute acts Bon Giovi and The Rozzers, who play songs by The Police. Long history: The Ritz in Brighouse, known as liveattheritz.com, started as The Ritz cinema in 1937. The cinema closed in 1963 but reopened as a bingo hall in 1965 Ms Townsend said: 'Our customers are not just local, they look online to see what we have going on. We are worried they might not be able to find us anymore and our customer base will plummet. 'It will be like starting over again and Glenn is not sure the business will survive that. Our customers are up in arms. This is a brilliant venue. 'Even the stars who come here to perform walk in here and go 'wow'. It is a traditional ballroom and it's great. They always ask to come back.' A message on The Ritz in Brighouse's website reads: 'We would wish all our loyal patrons to know that after taking the appropriate legal advice the owners of the Ritz, Brighouse, have absolutely zero alternative but to take this action due to the fact that this matter is entirely out with their control. 'We will of course keep you updated as to what the future holds for the former \"Ritz\" business.' Brighouse is a small town with a population of 32,000 and it takes its name from a building close to the bridge over the river Calder. Dating back decades: The venue was bought and renovated as a dance hall in 1981 before being taken over again in 1987 by a couple who had it for 27 years It's most famous exports are the indie band Embrace, who topped the charts with hit Gravity in 2004. It is also home to the world famous brass band The Brighouse and Rastrick Band. In 1977 they had unique success when they were at number two in the British charts for nine weeks with their recording of The Floral Dance. It was held off the top by Paul McCartney, although they still achieved sales of over a million, earning both Gold and Silver discs. Meanwhile the doors of The Ritz in London were first opened doors on May 24, 1906, by hotelier Cesar Ritz with the aim of becoming the ultimate destination for guests looking to stay at the most luxurious hotel in the land. Bedroom and suite rates at the Grade II-listed Ritz in London now range from £440 to £4,300 per night. Mr Smith, who has run the music hall for two years, said The Ritz in London came after his business after 80 years because they are after his domain name. Concerns: Mr Smith, who has run the music hall for two years, said the Ritz in London came after his business after 80 years because they are after his domain name He said the threat from The Ritz London is 'domain hijacking'. Speaking from the doomed Yorkshire venue, he explained: 'They don't care what our business is called. 'What they want is our domain name, liveattheritz.com and they're using bully-boy tactics to get it. Unfortunately it puts us out of business. 'We could never take on that fight because there's no way we can afford to do that. We would need thousands of pounds. 'We are successful as a small business in a way that we don't run at a loss but we don't make a lot of money, so we can't take on this fight. 'When I took over and was doing the marketing, our guy suggested we use the \"Live at the\" tag, just like Live at the Apollo and Live at the Barbican, so we decided on Live at the Ritz. Bedroom and suite rates at the Grade II-listed Ritz now range from £440 to £4,300 per night 'The domain name was available so we bought it. But now The Ritz want it and they will stop at nothing to get it. 'They use the law to say we are trading off their name to circumnavigate their customers from The Ritz and therefore we must hand it over. 'But that is ridiculous, we all know what they want. Nobody would ever turn up at the Brighouse Ritz, confusing it for The Ritz in London. It's ludicrous. 'To us our website is everything, it's the main staple of our business, without it we have nothing. 'We could put up a new plastic sign or put up bill posters but that is not getting to our customers. 'Our website is our everything, it's Twitter, our publicity, everything - the way we let our customers know what's going on. The Ritz Hotel in London, which is owned by the Barclay twins, has been asked for comment 'Without it we start from scratch and I don't think we will survive that.' Mr Smith, from Halifax, had been a customer at the 500-capacity Brighouse Ritz for 42 years, and has attended their monthly Motown nights for the past 20. So when it looked like the place might be heading for demolition in 2014, he stepped in and saved it, gave it a facelift and brought in live music acts to attract more customers. 'This is a million pound investment worth nothing overnight,' he said. 'This isn't just two years of history, it's 80 years of history. 'It's a real crying shame because it's an iconic building and a great boon for business in the area. When we have a sell-out gig on we can fill the local waterfront hotels. 'People are making suggestions to how we change our name but it's not so easy as that as we cannot use the word Ritz at all from the end of February - no redirection or anything.' The Ritz Hotel in London, which is owned by the Barclay twins, has been contacted for comment by MailOnline today.
