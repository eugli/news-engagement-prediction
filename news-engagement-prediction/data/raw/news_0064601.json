Credit Kim Ludbrook/European Pressphoto Agency JOHANNESBURG — Anti-immigrant protesters led a violent march into South Africa’s administrative capital, Pretoria, on Friday, and the police responded with rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannons. President Jacob Zuma appealed for calm and condemned the latest wave of anti-foreigner violence to grip South Africa in recent years. “Many citizens of other countries living in South Africa are law-abiding and contribute to the economy of the country positively,” Mr. Zuma said. “It is wrong to brandish all non-nationals as drug dealers or human traffickers,” he said. “Let us isolate those who commit such crimes and work with government to have them arrested, without stereotyping and causing harm to innocent people.” \nAdvertisement   Legal and illegal African immigrants to South Africa, which has the continent’s most advanced economy, have regularly drawn criticism, resentment and sometimes violent attacks in recent years.
