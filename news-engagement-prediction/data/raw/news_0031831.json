Image caption Leanne Wood said Mr Sargeant had claimed in 2011 that Communities First \"was only safe with Labour\" \nBut Ms Wood accused Mr Sargeant of \"walking away from our poorest communities\", saying it was \"scandalous\" he had not set out a replacement scheme. \nShe said the minister had accused Plaid of \"jeopardising\" the programme in the past, and had claimed Communities First \"was only safe with Labour\". \n\"Neither of those statements were true, they were pure spin,\" she said. \nIn response, Mr Sargeant accused Ms Wood of making a \"political swipe\". Image caption Carl Sargeant said poverty remained a \"persistent challenge\" \nThe announcement also led to a spat between the minister and backbench Labour AM Mike Hedges which led to Mr Sargeant publicly rebuking his party colleague, accusing him of trying to \"frighten people\". \nMr Hedges listed a series of programmes that he suggested would now end, saying it was a \"sad day\" for his constituency, Swansea East. \n\"A sad day for health as smoking cessation, smoke-free homes, exercise classes, healthy diet programmes... end,\" he said. \n\"A sad day for people who would have benefited from money awareness courses, utility bills advice, basic budgeting courses and income maximisation programmes.\" \nIn response, Mr Sargeant said: \"The member is wrong, quite clearly wrong to say all those programmes will end. \n\"He doesn't know if they'll end, I don't know if they'll end.\" \nHe added: \"It is rather unfortunate that the member uses that type of language to frighten people as opposed to be constructive in the way he approaches this in the chamber.\" 740 posts 'funded through programme' \nThe Welsh Government said most recent figures indicate 740 posts were funded through the Communities First programme. \nOver the next year bodies which deliver Communities First \"will be looking at opportunities for redeployment for many staff\", a spokeswoman said. \n\"Our phased approach is designed to reduce the impact on staff.\" \nCommunities First spends about £30m each year, with more than £300m spent since it was launched in 2001. \nAt one point it was supporting about 200 projects, before the number was reduced amid worries about its effectiveness . \nIn 2011, the head of a Communities First project in Wrexham was jailed for fraud after she diverted funds from the charity to herself and her family. \nMore recently, in 2015, it emerged that one project in Merthyr Tydfil spent most of its £1.5m budget over three years on salaries . \nPort Talbot community regeneration charity NSA Afan had its Communities First funding terminated by Welsh Government in January.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:01:27.116+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
