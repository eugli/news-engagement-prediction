(Supplied: Royal Commission) \nJudge Becroft said New Zealand was not immune from violent incidents inside youth detention, but he said the system was reserved for the most serious offenders. \n\"Young offenders need to be held to account — the real issue is how are they held to account, in what context, and is it a youth-specific approach?\" \nThe community in New Zealand is largely behind the diversionary approach, according to Dr Nessa Lynch — a youth justice expert from Wellington's Victoria University. \nDr Lynch said the diversion-focused system, which has been in place for 28 years and includes family group conferencing for more serious offending, also works for the victims. \n\"Because there's much more provision for participation in the actual process and the outcome, the victims are actually a lot happier than they are in the adult system,\" Dr Lynch said. Courts incorporate traditional Maori or Pacific Island practices \nWhile in New Zealand, Ms White and Mr Gooda watched a hearing at a Pasifika Court, which works within the youth court system. \nAccording to Judge Becroft, the country now has 14 Rangatahi and two Pasifika courts, which apply local laws but are based on traditional Maori or Pacific Island practices. \n\"A way that's consistent with their own culture, consistent with their own language,\" he said. \n\"The law is more appropriately applied and more appropriately respected when it's done through the cultural lens of the young offender.\" \nSince the rollout of the courts in 2008, Judge Becroft said reoffending had dropped by 10 to 15 per cent. \n\"But they're not primarily about reducing reoffending, they're about engendering and creating respect for the rule of law amongst a community that's been marginalised and is very suspicious if not antagonistic,\" he said. \nThe Northern Territory royal commission will be back in Darwin later this month to meet with current and former youth detention centre staff.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T09:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T05:34:43.623+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
