AAAAnd they tried cornering him (it didn't work) pic.twitter.com/oPJkpBU8iq \n— Steve Kopack (@SteveKopack) February 21, 2017 \nCBS New York reported that the cow escaped a slaughterhouse on Jamaica Avenue and was first cornered before noon after police received several calls reporting bovine sightings in a number of neighborhoods throughout the morning. \n“It was the running of the bulls today from what I understand,” resident Felicia Evans told CBS. \nAnd it appears she’s right. Every time the police tried to corner the animal, it found a way out. It was able to duck caution tape and sidestep police officers and their vehicles, eluding law enforcement for several hours. Police finally apprehended it in someone’s backyard. \nThe cow even dodged an officer who jumped on top of an emergency response vehicle hoping to surprise the uninhibited animal. It was unfazed. The cow rammed into someone and now is taking off again pic.twitter.com/JO71w2QLvt \n— Steve Kopack (@SteveKopack) February 21, 2017 \nAfter being shot with several tranquilizer darts, the cow started slowing down around 12:15 p.m. About 10 minutes later, the animal laid down in a residential yard, where police were able to tie its legs together to keep it from running away again. \nBelieve it or not, this is not the first time something like this has happened in Queens. In fact, in April, another cow — also on its way to slaughter — ran through the streets. Officers took that cow to Animal Care & Control in Brooklyn after they captured the bovine. However, comedian Jon Stewart and his wife, Tracey, had been following the ordeal, and decided they wanted to adopt the runaway cow . \nThe celebrity took the cow to the Farm Sanctuary’s shelter in Watkins Glen, New York. \nIt’s not yet clear where the latest freewheeling cow will go.
