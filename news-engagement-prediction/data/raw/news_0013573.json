Hayne injury nothing serious 0:49 \n“Everything is an option, I don’t like to live in narrow vision. \n“I played rugby when I was growing up. As a kid I did a lot of sports. That’s why it pisses me off when everyone carries on when someone changes sports. \n“As kids, we are encouraged to try every sport we can, so as an adult, why should that change? \n“That’s my stand on things. We get paid to do a job and we have to work our asses off at training, but once that contract is finished, if someone wants to try something different, that’s up to them.” View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
