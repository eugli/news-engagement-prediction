(AMA/Getty Images) \nGary Neville believes Jose Mourinho’s task of replacing Zlatan Ibrahimovic is a ‘huge job’ and insists the Manchester United boss must start thinking of suitable candidates. \nIbrahimovic has been in sublime form for United this season, scoring 26 goals in 38 appearances in all competitions so far following his free transfer from Paris Saint-Germain. \nNeville claims Ibrahimovic has made a huge impact in United’s dressing room and feels the 35-year-old will be tricky to replace once he leaves Old Trafford. \n‘I think he has to play every game at the moment. I’ve seen it over the years at United, United need players who have huge personality and character – Bryan Robson, Roy Keane, Cristiano Ronaldo, even Wayne Rooney three or four years ago. Ibrahimovic has 26 goals in 38 games this season. (Getty Images) \n‘You look at Pogba, who I don’t think is playing particularly well, who has that as well. \n‘You think there is a huge void there to fill. Ibrahimovic is definitely carrying them at the moment. \n‘The players will look at him in the tunnel and feel confident with him being there. Mourinho has hailed Ibrahimovic’s impact at United.
