Two civil lawsuits alleging unwanted advances were filed by female crew members on another movie, and were settled out of court for undisclosed sums. Affleck's lawyer at the time denied the allegations.\nIronically, the \"Manchester by the Sea\" role was first intended for Matt Damon, a Boston childhood friend of Casey and Ben Affleck. Damon had to step down because of other commitments.\nAn emotional Affleck thanked fellow nominee Washington, whom he credited with being one of the first people to teach him to act, as well as Damon and the film's screenwriter and director, Kenneth Lonergan.\n\"I'm really proud to be part of this community,\" Affleck said. \"I'm just dumbfounded that I'm included.\"\nAffleck adopts a much lower public profile than his brother Ben and appears uncomfortable in the spotlight. He was first nominated for an Oscar in 2008 for his lead role in \"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.\"\nWhile Ben Affleck has opted for big movies like \"Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice,\" Casey Affleck has focused his career on smaller, independent ventures with strong character-driven plots such as \"Gone Baby Gone.\"\nIn 2010, he wrote and directed Joaquin Phoenix in \"I'm Still Here,\" a mockumentary about Phoenix's supposed transition from acting to becoming a rap musician.\nAffleck was raised in the Boston area, started work as a child in TV shows, moved to Los Angeles after high school, and then dropped out of acting for a while to attend Columbia University in New York.\nTwo years ago he quietly separated from his wife, actress Summer Phoenix, after a nine-year marriage that produced two sons.\n(Reporting by Jill Serjeant; Editing by Sandra Maler)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T08:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T07:34:30.177+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
