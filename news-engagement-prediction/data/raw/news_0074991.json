(Source: Reuters) In what indicates a possible pick-up in the economy, Indian Railways ’ freight loading has seen a dramatic increase since late January, recovering from a trough of almost consistent negative year-on-year growth since late 2014-15. The robust data from the railways come on the heels of a 0.4% drop in industrial production and 8.7% contraction in cement output in December, reflecting the impact of demonetisation.\nAverage loading per day jumped to 3.27 million tonne (mt), an all-time high, during the 10-day period January 21-30, and was soon superseded — between February 11 and 20, daily loading hit 3.32 mt. In the first nine months of the fiscal year, the loading was just 2.7 mt per day. Freight loading between April and January was down 0.7% year on year while the revenue dropped 6%.\nAccording to a railway official, an average loading of around 3.25 mt/day is considered “healthy”. “The revenue is definitely looking up. In January, the railways carried around 94-mt load. February is looking very good… in the last four days (February 19-22), the loading has been 3.43 mt, 3.48 mt, 3.26 mt and 3.24 mt,” said the official. In fact, the trend of subdued freight receipts began in late 2014-15, resulting in IR missing its annual revenue targets. Freight revenue declined from R1,0,5791 crore in 2014-15 to R97,386 crore in 2015-16 and a flat growth is estimated (RE) for 2016-17.\nYou might also want to see this:\nThe previous best 10-day average loading was 3.18 mt/day during November 21-30 period last year. “We are witnessing a spurt in growth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T13:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T02:04:24.724+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
