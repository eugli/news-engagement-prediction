By Nicki Grihault, Telegraph Travel's Mauritius expert. \nMauritius's beautiful beaches are a key draw - and with over 160km-worth, including a calm lagoon almost entirely encircled by coral reef, you won't have to go far to find one. All beaches are public, with parking areas and toilets, although hotels have subtly claimed the best ones. \nThe north has the greatest concentration and variety of beaches, including small coves shaded by casuarina trees. The most celebrated stretches of talcum-white sand, gently sloping into a warm azure sea, are found in the glamorous east. The west coast has golden sand, shallow water and the best sunsets. Surf pounds the shore inbetween sandy stretches in the wilder south and offshore, are Robinson Crusoe-style islands. Grand Baie \nThe sheltered emerald waters of lively Grand Baie are too crowded with boats for swimming, but it's a place to get active and visit beaches nearby.

Those looking for a bit of buzz with their beach and watersports enthusiasts. \nWhat is there to do? Shopping, drinking and dining and the widest variety of watersports on the island - from a tandem sky dive (00 230 5421 4987; skydivemauritius.com ) to a Solar Sea walk (00 230 263 7819; solarunderseawalk.com ). Visit Mont Choisy, a long narrow white sand beach along a turquoise bay, the popular small cove of Péreybère and La Cuvette, a small silky cove with clear water and one of the island's finest spots for swimming. Excursions to the unmissable northern islands leave from here. \nBars and bites Aprés-sol bars and clubs include The Banana Beach Club and Zanzibar (00 230 263 0326; bananabeachclub.com ) and The Beach House (00 230 263 2599, thebeachhouse.mu ) with an unbeatable location, right on the water. International restaurants line Coastal Road, just behind the beach. The fishemran in the family delivers the fresh catch of the day to the unpretentious roadside Restaurant Coolen Chez Ram (00 230 263 8569), and favourites include the romantic seafood restaurant Le Capitaine (00 230 263 6867; le-capitaine.restaurant.mu ) which also serves extravagant cocktails. On the backstreets of Pereybère, newer contender Flowers of Paradise (00 230 269 1376; flowers-of-paradise-restaurant.com ) has gained a reputation among gourmands. \nGetting there The M2 from the airport in the southeast terminates here, so it's a straightforward drive or taxi ride. Plenty of buses also ply this popular route. Trou aux Biches \nA pretty, white sand beach shaded by casuarina trees with clear shallow water and the reef close to shore.

Everyone - although the flat, shallow water and mild currents make it ideal for families. \nWhat is there to do? Snorkelling. Divers will find some of the island's most popular sites, from the fish-filled Aquarium to sunken wrecks at Water Lily, through Blue Water Diving Centre (00 230 265 6700; bluewaterdivingcenter.com ) run by underwater photography specialist Hugh Vitry. Deep sea fishing trips also leave from here. \nBars and bites Gajak (snack) stalls hang around the parking spots, and plenty of small restaurants and a supermarket are found along the coastal road. Restaurant choices on the Coastal Road include the terracotta-coloured 1974 (00 230 265 7400/57054105), where keen kitesurfers Antonio and Giulia serve authentic Italian cuisine, and Pierre Noodles (00 230 57368575) where an octopus rougaille sandwich is a steal at MUR45. \nGetting there Just off the main M2, heading to Grand Baie, it's a straightforward drive or taxi ride. There are several parking spots beside the beach. Île aux Cerfs \nNamed after the stags ( cerfs ) that once roamed here, Mauritius's favourite island playground is a sand bar of talcum-white sand edged by translucent water.

Everyone from romantic couples who loll in the shallows to families and golfers. Avoid the weekend crowds. \nWhat is there to do? Every water sport imaginable, from banana boat rides to parasailing, speed boats to a pirate boat for kids, and a treetop adventure playground. It's the favourite lunch spot for speedboat and catamaran cruises along this coast - with a fish/lobster barbecue on the beach or on board. Play a round of golf in one of the world's most stunning settings on Ile aux Cerfs Golf Course (00 230 402 7720; ileauxcerfsleisureisland.com ). Stroll the couple of hours circuit around the island and at low tide, wade across to the tiny Ilot Mangenie. Private spots with sun lounger and butler service are bookable through Shangri-La’s Le Touessrok Resort & Spa. \nBars and bites The elegant Sands Grill is the spot for a decently priced seafood or grill lunch and La Chaumière Masala for an Indian Thali in rustic thatched 'pods' on stilts – both bookable on 00 230 402 7720; ileauxcerfsleisureisland.com . While away the afternoon with a Planter’s Punch at the rustic Sands Bar, away from the main fray. In Trou d’Eau Douce, Les Café des Arts (00 230 480 0220), an art gallery in a restored sugar mill dedicated to Manglier, the last student of Matisse, makes an unusual dinner venue. \nGetting there Half-hourly ferry: 8am–5pm (last boat back) from the public beach at Trou d’Eau Douce or for guests, from Shangri-La’s Le Tousserok Resort & Spa. Belle Mare Plage \nThis pristine 10km long white sand beach is one of the most beautiful on the island, although motorised water sports can make it a bit noisy in parts.

The rich and beautiful, and everyone else, including families. Bear in mind though that currents are stronger on the east coast and it is windier. \nWhat is there to do? The Pass, the east’s most famous dive site is found offshore. The breeze makes it perfect for windsurfing and sailing. \nBars and bites There's no shortage of fabulous restaurants and bars at exclusive resorts along this beach. An old favourite is the Laguna Bar at Constance Le Prince Maurice (00 230 402 3636; princemaurice.com ) at nearby Poste de Flacq in the northeast, where live jazz is played, and the more recently opened Barachois, is the island's only floating bar and restaurant. La Maison d’Été (00 230 410 5039; lamaisondete.com ) is a real find along this coast, serving delicious desserts like millefeuille with aged rum in its pretty open-sided thatched restaurant. \nGetting there", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T18:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T15:09:17.346+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
