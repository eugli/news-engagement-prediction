William Steakin, AOL.com Feb 24th 2017 12:42PM \nPresident Donald Trump's mere mention of Hillary Clinton's now infamous \"deplorables\" remark from the 2016 campaign sent the crowd at CPAC into a frenzy on Friday morning. \nChants of \"lock her up\" filled the auditorium at the Gaylord Convention Center after the president again defended his voters as \"great Americans\" against Clinton who during the presidential election said \"half\" of them are in what she called a \"basket of deplorables\" \n\"People came to vote and the media said 'where are they coming from?' These are hardworking great, great Americans. These are unbelievable people who have not been treated fairly. Hillary called them deplorable, they're not deplorable,\" said Trump.

That's the problem in politics; one wrong word and it's over.\" \n\"She also said irredeemable, but we won't mention that,\" Trump said interrupting the chants. 12 PHOTOS See Gallery President Trump's CPAC address U.S. President Donald Trump waves to supporters after speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, in Oxon Hill in Maryland, U.S., February 24, 2017.
