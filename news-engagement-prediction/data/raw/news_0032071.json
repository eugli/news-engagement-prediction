So I went for it with a mental trainer and it gave me that little bit extra you know,\" said Rosberg on the eve of the Laureus World Sports awards .\nAsked if he is planning to pursue yoga as well, Rosberg said: \"Yoga and meditation is quite similar. Meditation has given me something extra in my life. It will be great to explore India some day and do Yoga, the Indian way of exploring this training.\"\nHaving ended runner-up in 2014 and 2015, Rosberg vowed to avoid such disappointments and had hired a mind management specialist. He started to practice meditation, which ultimately played a key role in him winning the F1 championship.\n\"Thanks to the difficult moments in my life as they motivated me to do better. It gave me the push to keep fighting with all the dedication and hard work. Mediation also played a role,\" said Rosberg, who announced his shock retirement after winning his maiden world title last year.", "external_links": ["http://www.speakingtree.in/topics/soul/meditation", "http://www.speakingtree.in/topics/health/yoga"], "published": "2017-02-13T19:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T11:05:44.306+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
