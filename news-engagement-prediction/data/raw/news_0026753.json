Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nCoronation Street star Mikey North has revealed he's become a dad for the very first time as he and wife Rachael Isherwood welcomed their little son three months ago. \nThe actor, who plays fitness guru Gary Windass in the ITV soap, said baby son Archie was born on November 10th 2016 – and they've managed to keep the happy news to themselves until now. \nBut it was touch and go throughout Rachael's labour as she was almost forced to have a blood transfusion after her episiotomy went wrong. \n\"I had to have an episiotomy but unfortunately they cut through a vein and I lost one and a half litres of blood,\" Rachael revealed to OK! magazine.

Magazine) \nThe traumatic few hours before little Archie was born also saw Rachael being put on a drip to speed up her contractions, which she said was more painful than anything she'd ever experienced. \n\"She was throwing up with the pain,\" said Mikey. \"I had tears in my eyes just watching.\" \nLuckily, Archie was eventually born after 20 hours weighing 8lb 5oz – and the couple, who got married in January 2016, said being parents is the \"best thing ever\". \nIt comes after Stephanie Davis gave birth to her baby boy Caben-Albi on January 13th 2017 after a long labour. \nShe and the baby's father, Jeremy McConnell , seem to have put their differences to one side now that Jez has acknowledged paternity of his little son.
