Picture: Channel 7 Colin Vickery News Corp Australia Network Share \nMY Kitchen Rules has achieved another record — its first vomit. \nThe upchuck came during tonight’s epic fish fail by West Australian team Josh and Amy Meeuwissen. \nJosh, who had bragged about being a seafood king, couldn’t even plate up a decent main of fish and chips. \nWorse still, Josh’s cooking sent rival contestant Alyse Jenner running to the toilet for a good spew. MKR contestant Alyse rushes to the bathroom to vomit. Picture: Channel 7 Source: Supplied \nJudge Pete Evans gave Josh and Amy’s horror main of what was meant to be beer battered Barramundi with shoestring fries and tartare sauce a dismal 1 out of 10. \nFellow judge Manu Feildel scored them only slightly better with 2 out of 10 as Josh and Amy headed towards an overall score of 43 out of 110. \nJosh, a Broome-based deck hand, has spent most of his time on Seven’s cooking show bragging about his seafood skills. \nAs tonight’s episode started he said “when it comes to the preparing and cooking of seafood, I would beat a five star chef”. \nOh no he wouldn’t. My Kitchen Rules — Josh and Amy took hours preparing their entree. Picture: Channel 7 Source: Supplied \nThings got off to a rocky start at the pair’s Longshore Drift instant restaurant as rival teams and judges Evans and Feildel were forced to wait more than two and a quarter hours for the entree to arrive. \nAnd when it did, the chorizo-stuffed squid was a big disappointment. Josh had trouble charring the squid. My Kitchen Rules, Josh and Amy's entree — Chorizo stuffed squid. Picture: Channel 7 Source: Supplied \nEvans enjoyed the squid but took aim at the chorizo stuffing and especially the tomato sauce which he said “was not worthy of this competition”. \n“I would have liked to get the chorizo a little bit chunkier and more prominent in there,” Evans said. \n“(The sauce) tastes like tinned diced tomatoes.” \nEvans and Feildel gave the entree a mediocre 5 out of 10 but worse was to come — what one competitor described as “the most spectacular nosedive in the competition”. \nJosh was forced to scrap the beer batter when he had issues with the portable fryer. The shoestring fries were soggy and the tartare sauce tasted like gherkin juice. My Kitchen Rules, Josh and Amy's main — Barramundi and shoestring fries. Picture: Channel 7 Source: Supplied \nAll the kitchen calamities meant the contestants had to wait more than two and a half hours between entree and main. \n“Fish is meant to be my specialty and the judges are eating the worst fish I’ve ever cooked in my life,” a slightly more humble Josh said. \nEvans didn’t hold back. “Your fish is a disaster,” he said. “It wasn’t seasoned properly. It wasn’t cooked really that great either.” MKR contestant Alyse feeling sick at the dinner table. Picture: Channel 7 Source: Supplied \nAlyse had previously spoken about an aversion to fish and it only took a few mouthfuls of Josh’s Barramundi to tip her over the edge. \nAlyse turned pale, sprinted from the table and headed straight for the toilet. MKR contestant Alyse sprints to the bathroom. Picture: Channel 7 Source: Supplied \n“The Barramundi was the straw that broke the camel’s back and made me sick,” Alyse said. \nRival teams had already savaged Josh and Amy’s menu for being too simple and the poor main was all the ammunition they needed. \nQueensland’s Della Whearty thought the fries looked like small worms. \n“You obviously don’t know as much about seafood as you think you do,” Della’s teammate Tully Vella said. EMBARGOED TILL 9PM WEDNESDAY FEB 15. My Kitchen Rules, Josh and Amy's dessert — Cape Brandy Pudding. Picture: Channel 7 Source: Supplied \nDessert was Cape Brandy pudding and it too met with negative feedback, especially from Evans. \n“Did I enjoy it — not particularly,” Evans said. “I think the brandy’s a little overpowering for it. It is a little bit sweet.” \nFeildel was more positive, saying “I think it was the best dish out of the three courses tonight.” \nEvans gave Josh and Amy’s dessert 4 out of 10. Feildel gave it 8 out of 10. \nThe rival teams scored the pair’s food 18 out of 50, including a lowly 3 out of 10 from Albert and Dave Lau from New South Wales. \nJosh and Amy now sit at the bottom of the Group 2 leaderboard and look certainties to head to sudden death cook-off early next week. \nONE IS THE LONELIEST NUMBER \nHere are some of the teams that have scored 1 out of 10 for their dishes Thomas and Carla from My Kitchen Rules.
