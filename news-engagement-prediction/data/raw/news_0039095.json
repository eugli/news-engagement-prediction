The motion needed the backing of all three houses – bishops, clergy and laity. \nThe House of Bishops voted by 43 to 1 in favour of the motion, triggering speculation over which bishop had broken unanimity. \nIn a blog posted late on Wednesday , Cocksworth admitted his error. After praising the report as a valuable roadmap, he added: “Much to my embarrassment, however, I have managed to give the impression that there was not complete agreement in the House of Bishops that the report provided us with the best way forward. \n“Due to a moment of distraction and some confusion over the voting process, I pressed the wrong button on my handset, thus registering a vote against taking note rather than a vote for taking note of the report! I have apologised to my colleagues in the House of Bishops and to the archbishops for my mistake.” \nThe de facto rejection of the report is a blow to the bishops, which had upheld traditional teaching on marriage after six months of discussions after two years of intense closed-door working groups within the C of E. \nThey said there was “very little appetite” to change doctrine that defines marriage as a lifelong union of a man and a woman, while encouraging clergy to act with “maximum freedom” within the bounds of church law. \nAfter the vote, Pete Broadbent, bishop of Willesden, said the church had not yet “coalesced around an end point” on the issue of same-sex relationships. “More conversation is needed. We don’t yet know the next stage - nor yet when and whether we can bring any further report to the synod.” \nThe House of Bishops is expected to meet in the coming weeks to work out a way forward.
