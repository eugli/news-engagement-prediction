A few members of the Council had approached the Madras High Court against Vishal's candidature citing that he cannot contest for the post since he is already the General Secretary of Nadigar Sangam. The petitioner had sought the Court to nullify Vishal's nomination accepted by the Election Officer. Today when the matter came up for hearing, the Court has ruled that Vishal being a member of the Council can contest for its top post and endorsed the Election Officer's acceptance of his nomination. This is yet another victory for Vishal against the present office bearers of Producers Council. A few months back the actor had been disqualified from the basic membership for his alleged comments against the Council's office bearers. Later he filed his regret in the Court for his comment and the Court ordered to reinstate Vishal in the council. On the same day Vishal filed his nomination for the President post which was endorsed by none other than Ulaganayagan Kamal Haasan who is also a member of the Producers Council. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:35:53.941+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
