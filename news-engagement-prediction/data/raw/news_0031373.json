Photo: Google Maps Image 44 of 44 Tornado spotted in Fort Bend County near Rosenberg 1 / 44 Back to Gallery A strong line of storms hit the Houston region Tuesday, causing damage to some parts while sparking a wave of tornado warnings and sightings, strong winds, heavy rains, power outages and flight delays.\nThe worst of the storm passed through Houston by 10 a.m., weather radar showed, but a tornado watch will continue until about 1 p.m., according to the National Weather Service. The watches and warnings include Harris, Galveston, Brazoria and Fort Bend counties.\nThe storms may have been a factor in a fatal Montgomery County crash. An 18-year-old Magnolia High School student died after her vehicle hit an 18-wheeler on FM 149 near Jackson Road, said Sgt. Erik Burse with the Texas Department of Public Safety, which will investigate the crash.\nREAD MORE: Magnolia High student killed in Valentine's Day crash during severe weather\nDan Reilly of the National Weather Service Houston/Galveston office said there had been a few reports of damage and a possible tornado touchdown near Rosenberg. That information, however, was preliminary and not confirmed.\n\"There have been a number of spin-ups, gusty winds reported,\" Reilly said.\nShortly before 8:30 a.m. the weather service reported a trained spotter reported a brief tornado touchdown about 6 miles southwest of Rosenberg in Fort Bend. Missouri City's emergency preparedness office also reported spotting a tornado in the city.\nAnother tornado was spotted over the Houston Ship Channel about 9:30 a.m.\nResidents of the Tara Colony community, off Crabb River Road in Fort Bend County, counted themselves lucky as of mid-morning if their fences remained standing and their rooftops intact.\nAfter the morning's storms, debris covered lawns of the single-family homes. Trash bins lay on their sides. A portion of fencing sat suspended in one tree's branches.\nCounty employees helped with the cleanup. An American Red Cross vehicle, too, passed along the street. Multiple landscaping and roofing businesses arrived to hawk their services.\nGeoffrey Angevine bent over to gather shingles from the yard in front of his one-story brick and yellow-paneled home. He recalled how the wind had picked up around 8:20 a.m. When he went outside to look, he saw what resembled a giant dust devil coming up. \"So we shut the door,\" Angevine said.\nMap: Explore recorded tornadoes in Fort Bend, Harris counties, 1950-2016 Nearly 300 tornadoes in Harris and Fort Bend counties were reported to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Storm Events Database from January 1950 to October 2016.

The heat map at the bottom shows an animation of tornado locations over the past 65 years\nThe winds blew down his fence, opening up a view of the church across the street. It also tore off what he estimated was 20 percent of his roof. And it gave his old English bulldog, now eager for a pat on the head, something of a scare.\nThe event ended as quickly as it began.\nA few doors down, the wind had taken down much of Clifford Hammack's trees. He didn't hear them break -- he only heard the howl of the storm, said Hammack, who has lived there since 1982.\n\"It's kind of unnerving when it's slamming the house like that,\" said the 77-year-old, dressed in jeans, a t-shirt, and red suspenders. \"It's kind of an eerie sound.\"\nIn Galveston County, fierce winds ripped limbs from trees, causing damage to at least one home in Santa Fe and possible damage in Jamaica Beach on Galveston Island, interim county Emergency Management Director Garret Foskit said.\nWitnesses reported winds roaring through Jamaica Beach with such force that some damage was expected, but there had been no opportunity to inspect the area because of the storm’s intensity, Foskit said Tuesday morning.\nThere were no confirmed reports of tornadoes there but the force of the winds raised the possibility that one might have brushed Santa Fe or Jamaica Beach. “We’re waiting to hear from the National Weather Service, he said.\nThe storms at one point had left more than 21,000 CenterPoint Energy customers without power according to the company. The energy company reported that many lost power by 9 a.m., mostly in Fort Bend County and southwest Harris County. The number without power was down to 12,000 by about 10:40 a.m.\nThe company asks the public to report downed power lines by calling 713-207-2222.\nTornado damage in Tara along Crabb River Road. #HouWx pic.twitter.com/nd0ZyDAlOm\n— FBCSO Texas (@FBCSO) February 14, 2017 During the peak of the storms, Fort Bend ISD reported all schools in the area were sheltering in place, adding that all students and staff were safe. At 9 a.m. Houston ISD followed by asking its students and staff to also take shelter.\nAfter the tornado warning was extended to 10 a.m., the University of Houston issued a severe weather and shelter-in-place warning.\nThe university stated classes were still in session, but cautioned students to stay safe.\nHobby Airport experienced a ground stop about 10:30 a.m. due to a tornado warning, resulting in delays of 30 minutes or more that affected at least 22 flights, according to the Houston Airport System. The ground stop at Bush airport ended by 10:30 a.m., having left 130 flights delayed.\nIn response to the storms, Houston's Office of Emergency Management activated its Emergency Operations Center until 10:30 a.m., when the agency said there were no significant reports of damage or flooding and only 11 calls reporting trees or debris in the streets.\nThe line of storms, which stretched from Victoria all the way to Huntsville, produced strong winds of up to 60 mph along with a few tornadoes and some hail.\nRain totals were expected to range between 1 and 2 inches with little if any street flooding.\nGiven their speed, Reilly said storms may clear out of the region by mid-day.\nMost of Harris County received just 1 inch of rain, according to the flood control district, which reported the highest total -- 1.7 inches – to the west, near Memorial City.", "external_links": ["https://t.co/nd0ZyDAlOm", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/44/46/57/9595848/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg",
