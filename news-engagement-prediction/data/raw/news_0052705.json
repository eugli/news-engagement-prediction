Toronto police said the teen victim was recruited last October into the sex trade by a man with the promise of making a lot of money. The man attempted to control the girl with “threats and intimidation” during that time, police said in a release. \nThe victim was taken to hotels around Toronto and photographed nude. The pictures were posted on the web to advertise sexual services.\nThe girl attempted to flee from the man, but was found and sexually assaulted, investigators said.\nEventually she escaped and contacted police. \n  Michael Okoaki, 26, faces 12 charges including sexual assault, forcible confinement, assault and assault with a weapon, child pornography offences, trafficking offences and material benefit offences. \nAnyone with information is asked to contact police at 416-808-7474, or Crime Stoppers anonymously at 416-222-TIPS (8477).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:24:36.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
