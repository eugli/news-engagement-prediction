We can call it BAM’s home for the first time. \nI used to envy the training halls of other countries ... now, we have one equally as good. All of us need to treat it as our own home,” he said yesterday. \nWe are only allowed to wear certain type of shoes inside the hall because of the expensive flooring. It’s our responsibility to take care and maintain this place. \nIt’s too bad that this place is only ready now ... when I’m heading towards retirement. I wish we had a centre like this during my junior days. \nThose days we use to get angry because there weren’t enough courts. Now, everyone can train at the same time.” \n’ hostel, which is adjacent to the training hall, would be ready in April. \nThe players and our office staff have moved. Our players will shift to the new hostel once it’s completed. This is a milestone for BAM,” said Al-Amin, who estimates the maintenance cost for the academy to be more than RM300,000 per month. \nWe will now be able to house all our juniors and seniors under one roof. I’m sure we will see many more new faces coming through this academy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:33:06.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
