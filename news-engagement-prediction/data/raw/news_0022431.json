Oakley then told Phil Jackson, in one of MSG's tunnels, \"You didn't want to listen to me before so don't talk to me now.\" According to a manager, Oakley then said, \"All you whites over there get your story straight, why don't you have some brothers over there with you? Fuck all you white boys.\" As well as, \"Fuck you police, I used to respect you but now I don't have no respect for you motherfuckers.\" He then continued to repeat that they all \"just suck Dolan's dick.\" It's worth noting that all of those statements came from the Knicks' staff. For his part, Oakley said , \"What happened is me and four friends went to the game tonight, to watch the Knicks and Clippers. We did sit down, trying to have a good time. Next thing I know I was asked to leave the building. \"I asked, 'Why?' and they said, 'You have to leave because someone ordered you to leave.' And I'm like, 'I've been here four and a half minutes.'\" The Knicks have said they will send out a \"follow-up video\" of the incident later on Friday: \nGarden also indicates that \"follow-up video\" will be distributed later today. Very curious to see what it shows. — Howard Beck (@HowardBeck) February 10, 2017 This whole thing is a freakin' mess, and it's not lost on fans and pundits. \nLet's play along with the Knicks. Charles Oakley had one very bad day. Great. It happens. Now, Mr. Dolan can you explain the last 16 years. — Frank Isola (@FisolaNYDN) February 10, 2017 \nFor James Dolan, after the Isiah Thomas debacle, to be shaming OAKLEY for sexism and racism, without any evidence, is unconscionable. — Alexander Goot (@AGoot18) February 10, 2017 \nHoly hell!!!! Pl ase someone have one of these townhall meetings with James Dolan. I don't think he's surrounded by many truth tellers. — Michelle Beadle (@MichelleDBeadle) February 10, 2017 \nJames Dolan is the equivalent to woody johnson of the nfl.
