While filming an underwater documentary called 'Ocean's Deadliest' along Australia's Great Barrier Reef, he was pierced in the chest by a stingray barb which led to his death. He was 44. \nFebruary 22, 2017, marks the fearless naturalist's 55th birthday and as a way of celebrating one of the most adventurous lives lived, we give you some wonderful facts about the world's very own 'Crocodile Hunter'. \nHave a look! Steve Irwin grew up among animals, since his father founded Beerwah Reptile Park (now Australia Zoo) and inherited the love for animals from his parents. Irwin received a python for his sixth birthday, named it 'Fred'. By age nine, he was handling crocodiles under the supervision of his father. In 1991, Steve began running the Australia Zoo, the same year he made his first appearance in a television special about reptiles and wildlife. Irwin met his wife Terri, an American naturalist, at his zoo while she was visiting. Steve Irwin and his wife Terri's honeymoon video capturing crocodiles became the first episode of “The Crocodile Hunter”. In 2002, Steve starred in his only feature film, The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course, which won a Young Artist Award for the Best Family Feature Film – Comedy. The man who made his love for one of the most feared reptiles – crocodiles – his job, was greatly afraid of parrots. Steve was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001, honoring him for his service to global conservation and Australian tourism. A species of snapping turtle that Steve Irwin found, was named after him – Elseya Irwini. \nSteve Irwin's children - Bindi and Robert Irwin - are following in his footsteps to carry on his legacy and his work. Robert Irwin recently made an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. \nIn an Instagram post on Thursday, Bindi Irwin shared a wonderful photograph of her father remembering him on his birthday. She captioned the image: \"Always in our hearts\".
