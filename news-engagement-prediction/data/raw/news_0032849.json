The Samsung Gear S3 Frontier is the latest version of their smartwatch line and, after using it for weeks, we can say all but one thing—the competition needs to step up its game. \nThe Frontier line of the smartwatch, which is meant for outdoor activities, is the one we’ve been testing out. Priced at Rs 28,500, Samsung’s latest offering feels like the ultimate smartwatch to own. It runs the company’s own Native Tizen operating system that works in synergy with the native app. The rotating bezel makes a return, which makes navigation on the smartwatch a much better experience than ever before. \nThe smartwatch pairs over Bluetooth with most Android phones and now it even works with iPhones. It has built-in GPS for people who like to run outdoors and can also make calls, thanks to a speaker and microphone on board. Visually, the smartwatch is bigger than the predecessor. How does it fare against the Gear S2, you might ask; let’s find out. Design \nAt first glance, there is no doubt that the smartwatch is big and will put any smartwatch to shame, thanks to its 46mm frame. Being a bigger and heavier watch, it is undeniably more masculine than any other smartwatch we have tested in the past year. \nThe Gear S3 Frontier has a rugged look that appeals to outdoor watch enthusiasts, which might not be everyone’s cup of tea as some prefer the classier look. © MensXP \nThe Gear S3 Frontier is as durable as many other wearables since it is IP68 certified water-resistant. You can submerge it in water, provided you don’t submerge it beyond 1.5 meters or for more than 30 minutes. That being said, make sure you do not go swimming with this watch because it will falter. You can take a shower while wearing the smartwatch, however, you might face some difficulty operating the touchscreen until it has dried up. It is a little disappointing that Samsung did not opt to make it fully waterproof, as Apple did not fail to seize the opportunity. \nYou can even swap out the straps to add some personality and also change multiple switch watchfaces, which might just add that extra appeal you are looking for. The band, which comes with the Frontier, is made of silicone, which is perfect for outdoor use or at the gym. \nOn the left side of the body, a speaker has been tucked away, which allows you to make phone calls and even listen to music. At the back of the watch, you will find the heart rate sensor, which is similar to any other fitness tracker. However, what makes it stand out from the rest is that it can track your steps and heart rate continuously while you exercise. Screen © MensXP \nMuch like Samsung’s phones, the Frontier’s screen is stunning and amazing to look at. The fact that the watch is bigger, it is a given that the screen has gotten bigger as well. It sports a 1.3-inch screen, which also happens to be AMOLED touchscreen display. The colours are bright and vibrant maintaining sharpness that cannot be matched elsewhere. We faced no trouble viewing the screen in bright sunlight or at night, which is a great feat as those are some of the more common struggles we face with wearables today. Samsung also implemented Corning’s Gorilla Glass, which means it is scratch- and damage-resistant. Battery Life \nThe smartwatch is packed with some fancy new features and a display that nobody can rival. However, in order to support these new features, Samsung has installed a 380mAh battery which can make the Frontier last 2 to 2.5 days of regular use. Even though the battery size has been increased, we feel this is where Samsung has room to improve. \nThe extra battery life also enables the Frontier to have an altimeter and a speedometer on board which makes it one of the compelling fitness wearables out there. The ability to make phone calls straight from the smartwatch also demands a bigger battery since making long calls can cost you a lot of drainage of battery. You can even stream music to your watch over Wi-Fi, which is a neat feature I did not expect from Samsung. Functionality \nLike any other smartwatch, the Gear S3 Frontier functions like your companion where you can manage notifications that appear on your phone straight on your wrist. You can manage apps like Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter amongst many others. It can even track the weather where you can set your current location and get regular updates. You can even use voice to text functionality in case you do not want to type out the reply from your phone. \nOne can navigate the menus by rotating the bezels and can select a function by clicking on one of the two buttons or by tapping on the screen. It was the most attractive and useful feature on the Gear S3 frontier and is probably going to be the real reason why I love playing around with this smartwatch. \nThe Gear S3 also has an elaborate focus on the fitness quotient, which might be the feature most smartwatch users are interested in. Samsung S Health works like a charm with the ecosystem and you can track various fitness activities like gym, cycling, running, weight training, treadmill runs etc. It will also track your steps, sleep data and heart rate, which is expected from any smartwatch today. The Final Say \nThe Samsung Gear S3 is packed with a lot of features, apps, and functionality and it is hard to ignore this device. Even though the battery life is average if compared to other smartwatches, it makes up for it with ease of use and functionality. In order to accommodate so many features, the sleek design from the previous iteration has been sacrificed but it still looks stylish and appealing nonetheless. If you were looking to upgrade your current Android smartwatch or looking to buy a new one, we would strongly recommend the Gear S3 Frontier as your next buy. However, if you are an iPhone user, the experience might be a bit buggy and not up to the mark.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T14:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T06:20:44.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
