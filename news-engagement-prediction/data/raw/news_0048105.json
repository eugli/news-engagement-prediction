Now, Samsung says it has a quartet of new internal projects to unveil, focusing on augmented and virtual reality . All four will be shown off in more detail at Mobile World Congress later this month, but here’s what we know about them so far: Relúmĭno. A “visual aid” application for the Gear VR that helps the visually impaired read and watch TV with “new levels of clarity.” Image: Relúmĭno / Samsung Monitorless . A pair of “sunglasses” that support both AR and VR. They connect to your phone or PC and allow you to use your electronics in augmented or virtual reality. VuildUs . An app that allows users to see what furniture looks like in their house before they buy it. It uses a 360-degree camera to measure distances and depth, and works via an app for “compatible” VR devices. Not the first of its kind by a long chalk . traVRer . A 360-degree video platform that lets users “experience realistic virtual travel before and after a real-life trip.” Looks like any virtual reality ‘travel’ experience, albeit with a UI with more information. Image: trVRer / Samsung So, some sort-of interesting ideas here, and some stuff we’ve seen before. At any rate, we’ll be taking a closer look at these projects at MWC to see what’s worth your time and what isn’t.
