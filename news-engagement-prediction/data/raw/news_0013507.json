But the Republican and former Navy SEAL backed the policy during his gubernatorial run last year, citing Missouri's sluggish economic growth and a need for change toward union policy. \n\"Here's what you've heard from union bosses about right to work: it's a union-busting, job-killing, anti-worker program that will drive down wages and outlaw unions. Here's the truth: They're lying. Right to work creates jobs, grows wages, and increases union membership,\" his campaign website stated. \nHere's more from the Kansas City Star : Greitens' signature puts the finishing touches on decades of work by Republicans and business groups to enact a right-to-work law in Missouri, which allows employees in unionized workplaces to opt out of paying unions for the cost of being represented.Kansas has had a similar law on the books for more than 60 years....By signing the bill, Greitens is fulfilling one of his major campaign pledges. Labor unions spent heavily to defeat Greitens last year based largely on his pledge to work with state lawmakers to enact right-to-work legislation. He also mentioned the proposal in his State of the State address last month, saying \"Missouri has to become a right-to-work state.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T00:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:42:15.179+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
