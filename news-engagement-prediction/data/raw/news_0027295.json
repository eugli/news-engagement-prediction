(Getty Images) \nKieran Gibbs has claimed that Mark Clattenburg did not send him off for his last-man challenge on Lazar Markovic because the ball was going away from goal. \nThe Arsenal left-back was lucky to escape a red card in the second half after he barged the Hull City winger off the ball when he was clean through on goal. \nBut Gibbs has revealed Clattenburg’s reasoning for only giving a yellow card for the foul. \n‘I took a chance because Lauri [Laurent Koscielny] and Musti [Shkodran Mustafi] both jumped for the ball, I did actually try to go for the ball,’ Gibbs told Sky Sports. Clattenburg allegedly said the ball was going away from goal.
