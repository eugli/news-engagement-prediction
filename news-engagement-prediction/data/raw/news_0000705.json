Photo: AP \nBut the trouble is that's not the story of a people. It's not anything really, other than a statement of what someone isn't. In this formulation you can be \"not a terrorist\", but you can't be something. Not a contributor, not an asset, not even a battler. You can't be complex, nuanced, evolving. You can either confirm or \"challenge\" a predetermined stereotype, but that's just another way of saying you must prove your innocence – over, and over, and over ... \nSo it's hardly surprising that – even as the touching stories of those caught up in Trump's dark fantasy were everywhere – the fact of a terrorist attack on a mosque in Quebec City this week barely touched any emotional register. Nothing about the lives of the six Muslims killed, or even of the Trump-loving white guy who killed them, seems to have been worthy of quite the same treatment. Indeed we were spared even the ritual emoting that accompanies these things.

Trump did make his condolences public, but only as his press secretary said the event justified the President's \"proactive rather than reactive\" steps. How exactly these steps address this Quebecois tragedy is unclear. Perhaps Trump is banning millions of Muslims from coming to America because he's worried his more violent supporters will kill them. That's nice, I suppose. \nIt would be wrong to call this a double standard. It's not that we feel an affinity with Trump's stranded travellers that we don't with those killed in Quebec. The truth is we feel little affinity with either. It's just that the former are fodder for a story we're more interested in telling right now. The best way to tell that story has been to discover the humanity of those affected, but the story is really about Trump and his cyclonic presidency. That's the cause of the emotional investment. Were they victims of Obama, or even a right-wing lone-wolf terrorist, they'd be immediately less interesting, less human. Perhaps if that weren't so true, the very idea of a Trump's blanket ban would have been less saleable.
