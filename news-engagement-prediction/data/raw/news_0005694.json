Most Popular By Chris Clarke Jan 31, 2017 The world's largest air tanker, dubbed the Global Supertanker , is finally living up to its name. After an arduous approval process, the massive Boeing 747 firefighting aircraft performed its first mission in Israel. Now, the water bomber has been called from its home base in Colorado to fight the out-of-control blaze currently ongoing in Chile , and you can witness what the pilots' see as they maneuver the beastly airplane over the raging inferno.   Most Popular As a chain of more than 100 deadly wildfires have swept over large swaths of central and southern Chile, many fires remain uncontrolled. With the blazes burning for nearly two weeks, the U.S. has now joined France, Russia, and Peru as an international response to the crisis. The Global Supertanker has been operating from Santiago and has relied on a team of local firefighters to fulfill the extraordinary logistics of loading nearly 20,000 gallons of retardant required to fill the eight large pressurized tanks. Each of the tanks hold 200 lbs. of compressed air and can disperse retardant with high pressure. Fires and Flying How Drones Became Firefighting's Worst Enemy Since its arrival on Jan. 25, the tanker has performed multiple bombing missions every day while battling low visibility, rough turbulence, and harsh terrain all at very low altitudes. Along with its Russian counterpart, an Ilyushin IL-76, these two giants are a tag-team aerial effort to protect people and property from a fire that's already destroyed over 2,000 homes and claimed at least 11 lives.
