Namely content like brand new anime that is going to be coming our way in a matter of weeks. April showers don’t just bring May flowers; they also come with a deluge of excellent anime offerings for your viewing pleasure.

Fortunately, I’ve got you covered and have put together a comprehensive guide for the very best anime you need to put into your eyeballs this spring. With some hotly anticipated titles like Berserk and Attack on Titan making their triumphant and long-awaited return, and visually stunning newcomers like Hinako Note and Clockwork Planet , there’s a little something for everyone.
