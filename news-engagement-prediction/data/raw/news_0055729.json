Mumbai: 'Where there is a will, there is a way’ is definitely an adage that can be attached to Parineeti Chopra. The actress, who was struggling with her weight issues, took it upon herself to go from fat-to-fit and successfully achieved her desired body with extreme resilience and determination.\nParineeti similarly got fascinated with the sport of scuba diving when she tried it in Bali and set her mind on becoming an official scuba diver. The actress has again successfully achieved her mission by getting the Open Water Licence with substantial training at a dive club in Mumbai. This license now allows her to dive deep up to 30 metres under water.\nThe actress says, \"Diving is like meditation. It really is one of the most peaceful, exhilarating and exciting experiences of my life. Underwater, it’s absolutely silent and you get to see a wholly different world- things you never see on land! It's like flying, only you are underwater. I am a water baby and love to spend 4-5 days on an island diving. You are cut off from the world and it’s very peaceful,” she said.\nNot just that, Pari is also keen to get an advance certificate, explore night diving in the future and even scuba dive in places like New Zealand and the Galapagos Islands.\nParineeti’s Instagram account is filled with pictures of her various holidays and we can definitely expect some pictures of the official scuba diver soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T15:23:54.525+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
