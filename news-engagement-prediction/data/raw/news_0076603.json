Credit Nicole Fara Silver for The New York Times “A lot of people think that fado is sad. Fado is not sad. Fado is intense. It’s like life.” So said Gisela João , Portugal’s most widely acclaimed fado singer to emerge in this decade, as she headlined the first Fado Festival NYC . Her luminous concert at the Schimmel Center encompassed both desperate heartache and light-footed whimsy. Fado, which is Portuguese for “destiny” or “fate,” is a musical tradition that was recognized by Unesco in 2011 as an “intangible cultural heritage of humanity.” Fado emerged from the taverns of Lisbon, mingling the many influences of a port city, to become a matter of national pride, culminating in the 1950s and 1960s with worldwide recognition of the queen of fado, Amália Rodrigues. The songs, often about tragic love, balance a singer’s raw drama with the exquisite high counterpoint of the 12-stringed Portuguese guitarra, which can sound like a harpsichord or a bouzouki. After falling out of favor with a generation — in part because fado was associated with the era of fascist dictatorship that ended in 1974 — the 21st century has brought renewed appreciation and new performers to fado. Ms. João, whose debut album went to No. 1 in Portugal when it was released in 2013 and whose second album, “Nua,” came out last year, is a musical traditionalist. As on her albums, she was backed by a pristine trio of guitarra (Ricardo Parreira), classical guitar (Nelson Aleixo) and acoustic bass guitar (Francisco Gaspar); they opened the concert with an instrumental set that hinted at fado’s kinship with music around the Mediterranean. Photo Credit Nicole Fara Silver for The New York Times From her first song, “Madrugada s em Sono” (“Dawn Without Sleep”), Ms. João summoned a full spectrum of fado’s tempestuous passions, from hushed melancholy to eruptive, rough-edged, tearful peaks to aching resignation. Each of her ballads was its own drama, a white-knuckled journey through seismic emotions. \n  Yet Ms. João was hardly the black-clad, austerely mournful fado singer of earlier eras. Her chair and microphone stand were garlanded with bright flowers, and she wore a white, shiny minidress with its own leafy texture. She sipped white wine and offered smiling commentary in English, and after a few songs, she slipped out of her high heels and cheerfully admitted, “I’m short.” She had humorous songs like “O Senhor Extraterrestre” (“Mr. Alien”), about a friendly conversation with a green man who arrives via U.F.O. and goes “beep.” Another song, “Noite de Sao João” (“St. John’s Night”), had lyrics by a Portuguese rapper, Capicua. With her shoes off, she danced to her up-tempo songs. Ms. João reaches beyond Portugal for songs that she transforms into fado; her set included a song from the Brazilian songwriter Cartola and the traditional Mexican song “La Llorona,” both of them suffused with fado’s introspection and fierce attentiveness to poetic nuance. She also treats fado’s heritage with both deep respect and modern perspective. Her first hit in Portugal was a single, “O Meu Amigo Está Longe” (“My Friend Is Far Away”), from the Rodrigues repertoire, and she sang it on Saturday as an outpouring of loneliness compounded by unending love. But her version also connected the song with the chord progression of Aerosmith’s “Dream On”: a little revisionism to help an intense tradition endure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T05:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:35:20.681+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
