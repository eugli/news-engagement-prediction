Securing him for your first film while you're still a 16-year-old high school student is another. \nPlano Senior High School junior Evan Hara wrote a script for a movie about multidimensional space travel when he was a 15-year-old film student. He crowd-sourced financing. He recruited experienced actors. Evan Hara is a junior at Plano Senior High School. \nThen, Hara set his sights on one of the most celebrated names in science: Tyson. \n\"I imagined Neil in the movie when writing the script, so I thought, 'Why not shoot him an email?' \" Hara said. \"He replied back and agreed to do a cameo.\" \nBoom. Hara had the ingredients for The Boundary . Shot in and around Dallas, the movie screens at 8 p.m. Wednesday at the Angelika Theatre in Plano at the Shops at Legacy. \nHara, who already has a decent resume on the Internet Movie Database , had worked with the Angelika before on a his 7 1/2-minute short film about the viral sensation known as Alex from Target. \nHara had a bigger dream for The Boundary . Inspired by the movie Interstellar , he consulted with his film teacher, Brad Corn, \"a serious space nerd,\" and they collaborated on what they felt was a plausible plot. They started writing a script, checked into local casting agencies and turned to Indiegogo for crowd-source funding. And, he wanted some cred from either Tyson or Michio Kaku, another noted physicist. \nThree months after sending Tyson an email, Hara was in bed when he got an alert on his Apple Watch indicating Tyson had replied to his email. \nHara has Tyson's response memorized: \"The universe has kept me quite busy, but I'd love to do your project.\" Colton Tapp prepares for a scene in front of a green screen in Evan Hara's film The Boundary . \n\"I said 'Oh, my gosh!\" and ran downstairs still in my boxers and screaming,\" Hara said. \nHara and Tyson worked out a time to do the cameo via Skype and he appears near the end of The Boundary . \nHara and his filmmaking pals stopped by Home Depot for lumber to build a 14-by 20-foot spaceship in the backyard. \"We're real amateurs in building sets, but we thought it was a really strong set,\" Hara said. \"We totally killed the grass.\" \nWas this all within homeowners association rules? \n\"My mom used to be on the board, but no one really said anything,\" Hara said. \"Colton [Tapp, the film's lead actor ] said: 'Aren't you supposed to get authority?' I didn't know. \n\"But we tore it down almost immediately after the movie was done.\" \nShooting on the film was accomplished in two weeks â€” on spring break and over the summer. Tapp plays Miles Cooper, a former Air Force captain, who's told by NASA that the universe is a defined cube of space and that reality might not be what it seems. As the plot unfolds, Cooper and his co-pilot, travel to the edge of time and space in search of answers to their existence. \nTapp, who was awarded best actor by the Dallas Horror Film Festival, signed up for the film and noticed right away that the production was being handled by high school students. \"We found out they were incredibly professional,\" he said. \"They really handled themselves well. They were a handful of little prodigies. \n\"I think he'll have an awesome piece to show in youth festivals and youth submissions. I think it's really going to tear it up.\" Colton Tapp plays Miles Cooper, a former Air Force captain, in The Boundary .
