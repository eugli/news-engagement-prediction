Over the summer months the bizarre road project called Roe 8 has become a flashpoint and a symbol of Premier Barnett’s leadership style. While the focus has been on the bloody-minded determination of his government to bulldoze 100 hectares of remnant bushland in advance of the election whose outcome may cancel the project, not enough column inches have been devoted to the project’s severe economic shortcomings. \nRoe 8 is stage one of the Perth Freight Link which has no logic other than as a private road to serve a private port whose sale is supposed to cover the Barnett government’s blushes when it comes to their massive state debt. \nI oppose Roe 8 because it doesn’t offer a meaningful freight or passenger transport solution, and because it would be hugely wasteful of scarce public funds. In those circumstances, the damage it involves to the local environment and communities is unconscionable. Corporate corruption and government failure to act: who's running this country? | Carmen Lawrence Read more \nThe Perth Freight Link will create two private monopolies by building a commercially operated toll road in order to facilitate the fire sale of Fremantle Port. \nPrivate monopolies are the worst model of service delivery. They don’t involve or benefit from competition and they aren’t managed in the public interest. On the contrary, they take essential infrastructure and related services like roads, power, ports, and telecommunications, and allow them to be priced and controlled for the chief purpose of generating profit. Let’s not forget how the privatisation of Telstra has consigned us to 20 years of woefully inadequate broadband service. \nThe Perth Freight Link was first proposed in 2014 without any rigour or detail. It was announced without due planning or cost-benefit analysis or electoral mandate. When it emerged out of nowhere in Tony Abbott’s disastrous 2014 budget it hadn’t even been canvassed with the WA government. \nThe hasty analysis done after the announcement didn’t take account of the clear alternative, namely the development of container handling capacity in the Outer Harbour. This approach has been a matter of bipartisan planning agreement for nearly 20 years. I’m surprised how little recognition is given to the fact that this project was a high priority for the incoming Barnett government in 2008. It stalled and then crashed as a result of the legal dispute between the WA government and Len Buckeridge of BGC, the details of which remain secret. \nAs it stands, the Perth Freight Link doesn’t even reach the port, but ends at the traffic lights on Canning Highway. It will be the most expensive road on a per kilometre basis in WA’s history. The government’s announcement of a 3km tunnel from Stock Rd to Stirling Bridge is ridiculous and laughable. The basis for such an “announcement” was little more than a line of red crayon on a Google map, and was designed to mollify people in the new seat of Bicton in the hope of helping the Liberal candidate win that seat. \nThe Perth Freight Link will be a privately operated toll road. Only 8% of the traffic on the road will be freight trucks so any claim to separating “dangerous” trucks from passenger vehicles is rubbish. The road will only remain “free flowing” if a general toll is applied to suppress usage of the this route. That will inevitably mean leakage of trucks and passenger traffic onto local roads. Modelling suggests that within 10 years the freight traffic on Leach Highway, the current freight route, will reach the same level we currently experience. \nPrivately operated toll roads involve concession deeds by which the state government guarantees it will not introduce competing infrastructure that would otherwise compromise the value of the toll road. Such concession deeds will prevent future state governments from investing in local road projects in our community and, worse, from investing in public transport. 'It's not too late': Beeliar wetlands activists fight on as bulldozers roll in Read more \nI am disappointed that a project as poorly planned, hugely expensive, and widely harmful as the Perth Freight Link has been promoted by some as the magical cure to the serious congestion we face in the south-metro region of Western Australia. We do need investment in transport infrastructure. The failure to move forward with public transport and local road projects has been a signal failure of the Barnett government, aided and abetted by a federal Coalition that takes WA for granted. This mismanagement and neglect has seen WA slide into recession, with record debt and steepling unemployment. \nRoe 8 is not acceptable as a piece of transport infrastructure, and it will likely cost more than $3bn if it is ever completed. Designed to underwrite the profitability of a privatised Fremantle Port this private toll road will obstruct future governments from acting in the public interest. It’s also environmentally wrong, in the clearest terms, under the EPA’s own policy. \nNo wonder thousands of people have turned out to protest the recklessness of Roe 8. When any government ignores its own environmental policy and proceeds to destroy 100 hectares of significant bush land in the shadow of an election that could make that clearing unnecessary, what choice do citizens have but to stand up and speak out against that kind of stupidity and arrogance?
