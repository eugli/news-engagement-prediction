By Andrea Montgomery, Telegraph Travel's Tenerife expert. Click on the tabs below for the best places to stay, eat, drink and shop, including the best things to do and what to do on a short break. Why go? \nT he weather is the number one reason why most people flock to Tenerife’s shores, to enjoy almost guaranteed sunshine all year. Family-friendly and just a four-hour flight away, it is consistently one of Britain’s top winter sun destinations. \nMost holidaymakers head to the south-western resorts of Los Cristianos, Playa de las Americas and Costa Adeje where the bulk of the island’s holiday accommodation is located. Although it’s hard to see the join between the two resorts, Los Cristianos is quieter than its neighbour and attracts a more mature visitor. With excellent “access for all” policies, the resort is a good choice for those with disabilities. \nPlaya de las Americas has worked hard to revamp its image. Clichéd tourist tat and tired streets have been replaced with designer labels and bougainvillea-lined walkways, and the resort – still the main holiday centre on the island – now attracts predominantly families and couples.

Its four- and five-star hotels, chic boutiques and manicured beaches are a far cry from many people’s idea of Tenerife. On the south-east coast the resort of El Médano is fanned by near constant trade winds attracting surfers and retaining a Canarian culture. It also boasts the best natural beaches on the island. \nLos Gigantes on the west coast enjoys a sheltered location at the foot of its eponymous “giants” cliffs, offers long sunshine hours and provides a quieter alternative to the southern resorts. Further down the west coast, Playa San Juan and the traditional fishing village of Alcalá offer a more authentic flavour of Tenerife coupled with luxury hotel developments. La Orotava Old Town in Tenerife \nSet among vineyards and banana plantations at the foot of the fertile La Orotava Valley, the northern resort of Puerto de la Cruz is where you will find the genuine article in terms of Tinerfeño character. Slightly lower temperatures and occasional winter rainfall keep the north coast tropically lush and in stark contrast to the desert conditions of the south. \nHot and dry, the capital city of Santa Cruz is a popular cruise stopover with more than half a million passengers disembarking annually. Shopping, botanical gardens, plazas, art galleries, good restaurants and Las Teresitas beach make this an ideal city for a winter break. The best hotels in Tenerife When to go \nA s Tenerife has a spring/summer climate all year round, there is no bad time to visit. You are most likely to see some rain, particularly in the north, in November and February/March. High season is January to Easter. Flights from Britain are more plentiful and cheaper in the winter months whereas hotel prices are at their highest. With warm, sunny days and balmy nights, September is one of the nicest months to visit and prices have not yet hit their seasonal high. Where to go \nA visit to Tenerife is not complete without taking the cable car to the summit of Mount Teide, Spain's highest mountain, for panoramic views of the island. Another favourite activity is to head to lovely Garachico to drink coffee in the prettiest plaza on the island and swim in the rock pools hewn from lava. For a taste of the real Tenerife visit La Laguna, the former capital and a Unesco World Heritage Centre, which has eclectic architecture spanning four centuries, great shopping and a thriving tapas scene. If you're a hiker, don't miss the ancient laurel forests and rugged ravines of the Anaga Mountains. As Tenerife has a spring/summer climate all year round, there is no bad time to visit Know before you go \nFlight time : Anything from 4hr to 4hr 30min from London Time difference : The Canary Islands are in the same time zone as Britain Currency : The Euro; most establishments take credit and debit cards and there are plentiful ATMs Foreign Office advice : gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/spain Tourist information : webtenerife.com and todotenerife.es are the websites for the Tenerife Tourist Office Reading / apps : Read Insight Guide to Tenerife for a deeper understanding of history and culture Emergency numbers / contacts : 112 is the number to call for any emergency.
