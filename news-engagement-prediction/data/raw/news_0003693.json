Made this look like summer, and the show was magic,\" Dainty said. \nGuns N' Roses' are expected to hit the Westpac Stadium stage at 8pm on Thursday. \nThe band and their enormous crew touched down in the capital on Tuesday for the first of two New Zealand shows, which are part of the Australasian leg of their Not in this Lifetime tour . \nREAD MORE: \n\"The band will be energised, Wellingtonians should get something very special,\" Dainty said. MICHAEL LANZENBERGER \nGuns N' Roses touched down in Wellington on Tuesday. \nWhile he didn't know how the band, which includes foundation members Duff McKagan, Slash and Axl Rose, had been spending their time, he doubted the weather would have have deterred them from leaving their hotel. \n\"They've come this far and those sort of acts don't tend to stay cooped up in the hotel,\" Dainty said. \n\"I know there was a lot of chatter and excitement about New Zealand. I'm finding that with a lot of acts now, it's becoming fashionable. New Zealand seems to be on their shopping list.\" MAARTEN HOLL/FAIRFAX NZ \nGuns N' Roses promoter Paul Dainty says he hasn't seen any signs of the, at times, strained relationship between frontman Axl Rose and lead guitarist Slash on this tour. \nDainty expected the rock legend would be looking for more of that. \"Slash likes doing that stuff.\" \nWhen asked what the band's backstage demands were, Dainty said it was largely \"pretty grown up\" items. ZEALANDIA \nSlash holds a tuatara during a visit to Wellington's wildlife sanctuary Zealandia in February 2015. \n\"It's not like it was when I started out in the 1970s and 1980s when there were mad demands backstage. These days it's normal stuff, normal catering. I mean, lots of it ... [because] we're touring with 110 people or whatever.\" \nThe set list for Wellington and the Auckland show on Saturday remains a mystery, but Dainty said fans would get \"all the big songs\". \nWestpac Stadium CEO Shane Harmon said 32,000 tickets had been sold by Wednesday afternoon. Half were snapped up by fans outside of Wellington. \nThis was the biggest show to be hosted at Westpac Stadium since ACDCâ€‹ visited in 2010, Harmon said, and he expected the stadium to near capacity at 40,000. \nWHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW \n* Gates open at 5pm, \n* Those with seats on the field of play should arrive early because they need to receive a wristband \n* Opening act Wolfmother will kick off at 6.45pm with Guns N' Roses expected to take the stage at 8pm \n* The concert will finish about 10.45pm \n* Stadium parking will be available exclusively to concert attendees. \n* Extra seating will be available on all Johnsonville, Kapiti and Hutt Valley train services before the concert along with special services afterwards, which will depart once full, through to 1am. \n* Patrons seated near the stage will not be allowed to carry bottles with them, plastic or otherwise \n* Showers are forecast for Thursday afternoon but the rain should have cleared by 7pm \n* Tickets for the Wellington show were still available Wednesday evening, from $132.40. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T14:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T10:42:32.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
