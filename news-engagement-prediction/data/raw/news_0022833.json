First, he got brilliantly roasted by Melissa McCarthy on Saturday Night Live , then a story came out that Donald Trump was especially irritated by the impression (supposedly because it came from a girl ), and now The Hill is reporting that people on social media have located Spicer‚Äôs personal Venmo account and are using it for some delightful, low-stakes trolling. \nFor those who aren‚Äôt hip, Venmo is an app that allows you to give money to people or request money from people. So, if you lend Spicer $20 for some of that delicious gum that he eats , he could use Venmo to pay you back without having to find an ATM or whatever. The fun part here comes from that ‚Äúrequest money‚Äù feature. Apparently, people discovered that Spicer‚Äôs Venmo account was set to ‚Äúpublic‚Äù last night, meaning anyone could see his recent payments. It was changed to ‚Äúprivate‚Äù this morning, but Twitter users are still sending him funny requests for money: Let‚Äôs all request that Sean Spicer pay us $17.76 for all of his lies. He is AT-seanspicer on Venmo as well. pic.twitter.com/WDGRGbEH7e ‚Äî Michael Hoffman (@Hoffm) February 7, 2017 I FOUND SEAN SPICER ON VENMO AND I JUST pic.twitter.com/EbBwngvCJl ‚Äî Sarah McG (@sarahmcgbeauty) February 7, 2017 So Sean Spicer‚Äôs Venmo is public pic.twitter.com/TnP0UOUNP0 ‚Äî Mat Mazer (@mmmmazer) February 7, 2017 Sean Spicer‚Äôs Venmo account is public! Feel free to hit him up, he owes us pic.twitter.com/pYHZzPHlr4 ‚Äî Rahul Sharodi (@RSharodi) February 7, 2017 Today I found out @seanspicer has a public venmo. So I asked him to help a girl out.

Here‚Äôs one Twitter user who is actually helping him out: PSA: SEAN SPICER‚ÄôS VENMO ACCOUNT IS PUBLIC HOLY SHIT pic.twitter.com/6kPnmaCukj ‚Äî (((Emma Tolkin))) (@emmaterrestrial) February 7, 2017 \nIt seems safe to assume that nobody asking Spicer for money will actually get anything, but if he really has a good sense of humor about this maybe he‚Äôll send a few bucks to one of the millions of people who asked him for ‚Äúweed money‚Äù today. \nSubmit your Newswire tips here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T07:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:58:44.573+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
