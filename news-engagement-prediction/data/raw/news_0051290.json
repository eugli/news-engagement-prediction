The traditional networks need to step up so they don't get left behind,\" he told the BBC. \nGoogle is developing a network of huge balloons to provide connectivity to rural areas around the world, known as Project Loon. \nLast month the tech giant confirmed it had closed its internet drone project, Titan, which was designed to bring the internet to remote rural areas. \nFacebook's Project Aquila involves building solar-powered aircraft which will fly for months at a time above remote places, beaming down an internet connection.
