Thomas Hawthorne, Arizona Republic Dale Earnhardt Jr. tweeted with a NASCAR fan from Indonesia about President Trump's immigration ban. (Photo: Thomas Hawthorne, Arizona Republic) \nAVONDALE, Ariz. -- Dale Earnhardt Jr. is making headlines for a Twitter conversation he had Sunday with a NASCAR fan in Indonesia about one of President Trump's new policies. \nThe sport's most popular driver, who was back testing in a car at Phoenix International Raceway for the first time since being sidelined by a concussion last July, was asked for his reaction to President Trump’s controversial immigration ban on people from seven predominantly-Muslim countries. \nEarnhardt tweeted back that his family left from Germany in the 1700s to escape religious persecution, adding, “America is created by immigrants.” @GelarBudidarma my fam immigrated from Germany in 1700s escaping religious persecution. America is created by immigrants. — Dale Earnhardt Jr. (@DaleJr) January 29, 2017 @DaleJr sorry about the last tweet, just feel uncomfortable in situation right now. — Gelar Budidarma (@GelarBudidarma) January 29, 2017 \nOn Tuesday at the track, he expanded on why he chose to reach out to the fan. \n“I felt like I wanted to show him some compassion and I looked at his profile and saw he was a NASCAR fan. I just felt like reaching out,” Earnhardt said. “I wasn’t trying to interject into a political conversation. … It just really is very, very interesting what’s going on in the world considering all the research I did on my own family tree. \n\"... I read a lot of news and try to stay on top of everything, current events. Not that I'm an expert or understand everything going on, but it just felt like that guy needed some compassion. Not that I understand what it feels like to be in that position, but I certainly felt bad for the guy.” \nMcManaman writes for the Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY Network. \nFollow him on Twitter @azbobbymac Facebook Posted!
