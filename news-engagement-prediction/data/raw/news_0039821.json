He died last June. Credit Mark Lennihan/Associated Press Bill Cunningham, the beloved chronicler of street fashion and a longtime photographer for The New York Times who died last year at 87 , was known for circulating the city with his Biria bicycle and Nikon camera, often while wearing a blue French worker’s jacket. Those personal possessions, along with Mr. Cunningham’s library and ephemera, are now part of the permanent collection at the New-York Historical Society and will be displayed there this spring. Photo A bicycle used by Bill Cunningham, circa 2002; a jacket of Mr. Cunningham’s; and a camera, used by Mr. Cunningham, around 2012. Credit Glenn Castellano, New-York Historical Society John Kurdewan , a staff editor for The Times who was the assistant to Mr. Cunningham, known for his On the Street and Evening Hours columns, donated the items with Louise Doktor, Mr. Cunningham’s friend and muse. Louise Mirrer, the Historical Society’s president, said in a statement that the museum’s relationship with Mr. Cunningham dated back “to his first donation of 88 gelatin silver photographs representing his ‘ Facades ’ series,” and continued to the end of his life. She added, “It is with great pride that the New-York Historical Society becomes the new home for his earthly belongings.” Mr. Cunningham’s library contains more than 200 books stuffed with clippings, notes and photographs. Other items include a helmet covered with images from his Times column — a gift from Bergdorf Goodman — and his New York Living Landmark presentation plate made by Cartier in 2009. His tools, millinery supplies and feather collection were also donated. Details about which things the Historical Society will exhibit, and when they will be on view, are to be announced at a later date.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T23:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T20:37:08.085+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
