Editor Advertisement \nI know sometimes the gas delivery man is on a rush to complete many deliveries for gas. Many people are waiting to replace their empty gas tanks for new ones so they can cook. \nBut still, why park like this? Cannot take a few more seconds to actually par properly ah? Other than parallel parking, angle parking, or perpendicular parking, can anybody else explain what kind of parking is this? That's three lots taken up! \nWe make this guy famous! \nMick \nA.S.S.
