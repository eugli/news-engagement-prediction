More by Jacob Adelman \nCity Council members have proposed legislation aimed at encouraging development along Philadelphia's public-transportation corridors in an effort to fight vehicle congestion and aid the environment by increasing ridership. \nBlondell Reynolds Brown and William Greenlee introduced the so-called transit-oriented development ordinance during Thursday's City Council session. \nThe proposed legislation allows for the establishment of Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) Overlay Districts within 500 feet of selected transit stations. \nWithin those districts, developers would be permitted to build higher structures with less parking than is otherwise permitted by area zoning, according to the text of the ordinance. \nThe measure also would prohibit paid parking lots inside TOD Overlay Districts and in some cases would require new buildings there to have active ground-floor uses, such as retail, among other provisions. \nThe ordinance does not identify which stations would be surrounded by TOD Districts, so that they can be designated with community input during subsequent hearings. \n\"This ordinance sets forth the framework and refines the mechanisms to incentivize future development along our city’s major public-transportation corridors,\" Reynolds Brown's office said in a statement. \nPhiladelphia already offers such extra height allowances, known as \"density bonuses,\" to developers who include features such as mixed-income housing, public space, and environmentally friendly designs in their plans. \nGovernmental steps to encourage transit-oriented development have been taken in Austin, Texas, Atlanta, and Arlington, Va., and as well as statewide in New Jersey, according to Reynolds Brown's office.
