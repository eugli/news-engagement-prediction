He is one musician I adore, legendary to me. But you cannot use a tool that you are not used to,” the stand up comedian said in an interview with GoldmyneTV. \n“How are you going to express yourself TuFace when microphone is right in your face and you are asked to express your grievance and the reason why you are protesting? You can’t express yourself, it’s not your game. Do it with music you are used to. TuFace is the only illiterate who can sing correctly.” \nHe made reference to the late Afrobeat king, Fela and the late Sunny Okosuns, saying they all protested in the best way they could by using music. \nSee the video below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T04:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:11:40.972+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
