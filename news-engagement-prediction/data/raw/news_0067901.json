A little bit different. And he's always been there for them. So this award is for all the kooks and all the people who make the kooks.”\nBowie died on Jan. 10, 2016, two days after his 69th birthday, after a battle with liver cancer.\nMichael C. Hall, who starred in Bowie’s musical “Lazarus,” accepted the “Changes” singer’s award for Best Male Solo Artist.\n“This award is for all the kooks and all the people who make the kooks,” Jones said.

But since he can't be here tonight, I’m here tonight on his behalf and on behalf of his family to accept this testament to a man beholden to nothing but his own boundless imagination and daring, whose ever-expanding artistic vitality simultaneously soothes us and sears us and astonishes us,\" Hall said.\n\"Maybe he is here tonight? I don’t know. But I’m honored to stand before you and acknowledge the potency of his work and, if I may, also acknowledge that David’s kindness and generosity and enthusiasm will forever inspire me to be a better man on his behalf.”\nSend a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:53:19.420+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
