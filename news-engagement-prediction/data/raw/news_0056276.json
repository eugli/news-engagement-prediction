Everything in them is reduced to scale, down to worn posters and discarded cigarette stubs.\nThis model is based on a building found on Willow Street, in the Tenderloin neighbourhood of San Francisco.\nThis shipping container was originally located in Haymarket in Sydney, before Smith shrunk it down to size.\nThis building is also based on one found in Sydney's Chinatown, and contains LED lights to keep it illuminated at night. Smith has even recreated the bin bags left on the street.\nSmith's work features in New Realities, a group show that runs until 25 March 2017 at the Muriel Guepin Gallery in New York.\nAll photographs courtesy of the Muriel Guepin Gallery", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1346/production/_94743940_g-2.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8812/production/_94743843_dfg.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/12452/production/_94743847_f.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/FDA6/production/_94743946_gg.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/14BC6/production/_94743948_h-2.jpg", "http://www.murielguepingallery.com/exhibitions/new-realities", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1B16/production/_94743960_h.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6166/production/_94743942_g.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/AF86/production/_94743944_gdf.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/D632/production/_94743845_dfgdf.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6936/production/_94743962_o.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/17272/production/_94743849_fgf.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-22T06:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:18:55.216+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
