In 2006, officers with cameras were stationed along the stretch of road, catching 40 motorists crossing the centre line in just six hours. \nAt the time, police said they were shocked at the number of people with no regard for double yellow lines. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T12:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T08:03:31.324+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
