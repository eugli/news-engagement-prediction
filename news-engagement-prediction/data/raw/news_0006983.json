He can be unsettling, and that’s clearly the point. “BagBak,” his first new track since 2016’s Prima Donna EP , is a sub-3-minute gut-punch that brings his hip-hop braggadocio to the world of protest music. \nStaples’ refined, stream-of-consciousness flow and careful repetition is deployed over a sinister beat, that suggests Detroit techno meets Yeezus . The track’s hollow synth melody, trap hi-hat, and relentless bass come courtesy of Ray Brady, who’s collaborated with Santigold and Kilo Kish . The typically verbose Staples is as concise as ever, bouncing between hot-button issues (mass incarceration, race wars, police profiling, gentrification), building up steam from verse to verse (“Prison system broken/Racial war commotion/Until the president get that/Shit, Vincent won't be votin’”). He’s already spoken eloquently on the issues he raps about; “BagBak” serves more as a direct expression of anger at the forces that oppose his ideals. Coming from Staples, a call for the “one percent,” the government, and the president to “suck a dick” feels like a triumphant call to arms.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T05:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T08:25:36.608+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
