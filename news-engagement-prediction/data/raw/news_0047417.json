Appearing on Tuesday's Good Morning Britain , the 30-year-old recalled moment she was told to take off the clothing as she was going through security. \"I was flying to New York recently I was wearing a headscarf and I got stopped and racially profiled for the first time in my life,\" she said. \"Here at Heathrow. She opened my passport and saw Lindsay Lohan and started immediately apologising but then said please take off your headscarf. I did, I mean it's OK.\" \n\"But what scared me was that moment, how would another woman who doesn't feel comfortable taking off her headscarf feel,\" she added. \"That was really interesting to me. I was kind of in shock. I can't speak for what the purpose of it was. But it was jarring. I got double checked until she realised. No [I'd never had that before]. It was strange. It did [freak me out]. I'm from New York, born and raised. I was a little intimidated.\" EXCLUSIVE: @lindsaylohan spoke to us about ditching her party lifestyle, her friendship with @Oprah and much more https://t.co/MRWaKcIkjL pic.twitter.com/c0y91QvjwT — Good Morning Britain (@GMB) February 21, 2017 \nThe Hollywood actress also refused to confirm reports she has converted to Islam but said it was a \"consideration\". \"I think that me studying the Quran is something that I found a solace in. It was a religion where I found a lot of peace,\" remarked the American star. \"It doesn't, you can't just convert to a religion overnight, it's a culture and a practice. I do study it, nothing is confirmed yet. Yeah I do [read it] – it's a translation. But it's easier for me to learn Arabic by writing it and for prayer I'll listen to it.\" When prompted further, Lindsay said: \"I think religion is, any religion anyone chooses in a personal belief, my sister’s Buddhist. It’s a consideration I have.\" \nSTORY: Lindsay Lohan speaks about her unusual accent \nThe Mean Girls actress went on to say she found \"solace\" in religion. \"I find a solace in studying, not just the Quran, other religion,\" she explained. \"Just like meditation. Something that feeds my soul and learning different cultures and beliefs and the Islamic culture I've found a lot of people, I feel like it's a family to me. A lot of my friends that are Arab and they've been really good people to me. Also working with kids in Syria, it's something I want to learn the language so I can discuss situations with them.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:39:22.652+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
