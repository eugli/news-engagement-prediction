POPULAR \nIt didn’t go down as a massive success, but he still went on to capture the WWE Championship some months later. SIGN UP NOW \nWant to become a GMS writer?

Article continues below \nThis all stems from what Dave Meltzer has reported on the latest edition of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter. NOT A BIG DRAW \nHe’s claiming that Ambrose actually did quite well during his time asWWE Champion, but the issue is that he doesn't draw or performs well enough as the top guy to remain in that position. \nHe went on to add that while Ambrose will have more runs in the main event scene in the future, it looks highly unlikely that he’ll be capturing the WWE Champion anytime soon. \nThat doesn’t mean the opportunities won’t be there, though. But there’s a clear difference in being a guy that can appear in main event matches on a consistent basis, and being the WWE Champion and the top guy the WWE can rely on. \nEven though he’s loved as a face, perhaps a heel turn in the future can make the officials change their minds, as the talent is clearly there. \nWhen do you think Dean Ambrose will be a WWE Champion again?
