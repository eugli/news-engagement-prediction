That kind of undue influence that says if you do not vote Labour you will ‘go to hell’ is completely wrong. \n“We live in a free democracy and we have a right to vote for who we want. If people want to vote for Labour, that’s fine, I have no problem with that. But don’t pressurise people into doing what you what you them to do. \n“It did not go down well in the Asian community. I think overall, Labour has taken for granted the traditional Muslim vote and they think that they can dictate the mindset of voters, and that’s wrong. I think what will happen in reality is that voters will be more aware.” \nThe Stoke citizen believed the messages were sent after Labour supporters became threatened as Paul Nuttall campaigned outside a mosque last Friday in Hanley, Stoke, where Ukip's campaign pledges were well received by worshippers.
