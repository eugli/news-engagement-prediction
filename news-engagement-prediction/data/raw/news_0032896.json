Muhammad Nazim decided to sell satay to support his family. \nMuhammad Nazim said to attract customers, he tweaked the dish by comparing several varieties in town before coming up with his own using a secret recipe. \n“Due to my health condition, I only sell satay within Taman Nusa Bayu between 8pm and 11.30pm daily. \n“I can only carry 350 sticks of chicken and beef satay,” he said, adding that each stick of chicken and beef satay costs RM0.70 and RM0.80 respectively, with free ketupat. \nHe started his business with a capital of only RM500 and uses a normal satay grill. \nMuhammad Nazim is happy his hard work is paying off as satisfied customers help to promote his satay through Facebook. \nHe also takes catering orders. \n“My wife has been a pillar of strength as most of the work is done by her, from buying and preparing the ingredients to packing them,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T03:15:57.060+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
