Sullivan / MLB.com | @Sullivan_Ranger | + 0 COMMENTS \nSURPRISE, Ariz. -- Rangers slugger Josh Hamilton reaggravated his surgically repaired left knee and has flown back to Texas to be examined by Dr. Walt Lowe in Houston. \nHamilton felt a problem with the knee while doing \"arc\" running on Tuesday, which means he was running at an angle and simulating baserunning rather than just a straight line. \n\"It was not full speed, but there was some angle with the arcs, so he may have aggravated it,\" Rangers assistant general manager Mike Daly said. \"Our trainers connected with Dr. Lowe, and he requested to look at Josh.\" \nâ€¢ Spring Training: Info | Tickets | Schedule | Gear \nHamilton has undergone three operations on his left knee. He had cleanup surgery on Sept. 11, 2015, and again on Oct. 28, 2015. Those operations did not fix the problem, so Hamilton underwent surgery last June 8 to repair a torn ACL. \nHamilton did not play at all last season. and he was released at the end of August. The five-time All-Star received medical clearance in December and signed a Minor League contract with the Rangers. He came to camp looking to earn a spot as the designated hitter and a possible backup at first base and outfield. \nHamilton's camp had been going well until Tuesday. \n\"He had been working out swinging the bat and taking ground balls,\" Daly said. \"We'll wait and see what Dr. Lowe has to say. We want to make sure Josh is healthy.\" has covered the Rangers since 1989, and for MLB.com since 2006. Follow him on Twitter @Sullivan_Ranger and listen to his podcast .
