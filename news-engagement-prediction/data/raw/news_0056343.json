Even though the police arrested thirty BJP activists, they didn't have any idea about the agitation held by the party. It is learnt that chief minister Mamata Banerjee was holding a meeting with state power department officials when the sudden demonstration at the state headquarters took place. \n\nThe BJP workers were protesting against faulty publication of Teachers Eligibility Test (TET) results. Displaying placards and festoons, BJP activists shouted slogans against the state government which had published TET results during later part of last year. More than 13 lakh job seekers had appeared in the examinations to get jobs of teachers at various government and government-sponsored schools in Bengal. \n\nSources at Nabanna said that the chief minister was unhappy with the police which did not have advance information about Thursday's agitation by BJP workers. \"Section 144 under CrPc is always there in and around Nabanna, which prohibits assemble of more than five persons. But today, BJP activists managed to hold the demonstration by violating the prohibitory order and our police had no clue about the gathering. We have sought a clarification from the police on the incident,\" said a senior state government official. \n\nInterestingly, CPI (M) is also planning to hold a march to Nabanna in May. It is learnt that the two-day CPI (M) state committee meeting which concluded here during the day, has decided to hold their agitation on May 8. \n\nBut the BJP on Thursday held wildcat agitation at a time when the CPIM is holding state committee meeting to finalize the date for their Nabanna agitation. \n\nA senior BJP leader said \"Mamata's government is not giving permission to our party for holding rallies and meetings. We held today's agitation without seeking permission from the police as we knew it well that Mamata Banerjee's police would never grant us any permission for our rallies.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T14:29:31.311+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
