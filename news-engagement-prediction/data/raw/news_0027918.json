Scene changes occur without fuss — and the orphaned hero’s growing up is easily shown. As the second scene starts, he pops out twice from a group of villagers: first, as a little boy with dark, curly hair, and then as a young adult with dark, curly hair (Renan Cerdeiro). This hero already has a sweetheart, his Fiancée (Jeanette Delgado). They, too, do fouetté turns, but on alternating legs (ballet’s equivalent of a tongue-twister). Mr. Ratmansky achieves, with seeming effortlessness, a folk-like style for the villagers that feels wholly unlike that of the Fairy and her retinue and yet (in certain pouncing jumps, landing on both feet, called assemblés) feels fascinatingly related. Photo Miami City Ballet dancers in “The Fairy’s Kiss,” by by Alexei Ratmansky. Credit Gene Schiavone Mr. Ratmansky always allows Stravinsky’s music to speak. Gary Sheldon was conducting the Opus One Orchestra : Sometimes nothing happens onstage while the score lets the atmosphere change; sometimes Stravinsky builds up a giddying momentum beneath a seemingly straightforward incident. In each scene, the Fairy returns in a new disguise, tempting the Young Man from his Fiancée. Stravinsky planned “Baiser” on two levels. He adapted Hans Christian Andersen’s fairy tale “The Ice Maiden,” the story of a boy who is claimed as a baby by the immortal maiden of the glacier. Reappearing on the eve of his marriage, she whisks him away from his bride. The title character becomes Stravinsky’s Fairy; “Baiser” also suggests that Tchaikovsky’s muse singled him out for a life of art rather than of joy. In Mr. Ratmansky’s version, the Fairy, beginning as Andersen’s violent and cruel spirit of the glacier, gradually becomes his muse, who separates the Young Man from ordinary mortals. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story And Mr. Ratmansky makes the final scene a world beyond space and time where the Young Man is alone among works of art — indeed, tableaus of choreography. This is Mr. Ratmansky’s boldest and most beautiful masterstroke. You see imagery from historic ballets (“Giselle”; Nijinska’s “Les Noces”; Balanchine’s “Apollo”; and others), but the point is not any Spot the Ballet Quotation — though I’ll enjoy that on later visits to this work. Its great achievement here is to show a realm of timeless art, with the Young Man amazed in its midst. You watch the formations cohere, melt and change, fluently and enthrallingly, like sand patterns changed by successive sea waves. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
