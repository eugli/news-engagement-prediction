He shouldn’t go to his grave before me.” \nBut the biggest shock came when his mum revealed his breakfast consists of two egg salad, salad cream rolls, pot noodle on toast, two toasted pate sandwiches and meatballs with three slices of bread and butter! \nHowever, many viewers accused Sue of being a hypocrite - considering she looked bigger than her son. \nJeremy pointed out she wasn’t slim, which she put down to a disability, making her “unable to move”. \nBut viewers weren’t convinced, with one saying: “Sorry but what disability stop her from loosing weight? Lead by example hon! (sic).” \nAnother added: “Not being able to move, does not make you fat ... eating too many calories makes you fat #JeremyKyle.” Read More Jeremy pointed out she wasn't slim (Photo: ITV) Sue put it down to a disability (Photo: ITV) But viewers weren't convinced (Photo: ITV) Jonathan is going to boot camp now (Photo: ITV) \nA third added: “‘Help!

Look at the size of you! #jeremykyle.” \nIn the end, Jonathan got sent to a 12-week residential boot camp, where he’ll be taught to change his mindset on food, as well as exercise. \nJonathan will be back on the show soon for viewers to find out the results. \n*The Jeremy Kyle Show continues on ITV1 weekdays at 9.25am Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T18:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T14:07:49.316+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
