Could   \nA dad of one died in his sleep after he accidentally took too many prescribed painkillers for his bad back. \nTy Porter, 40, had so much morphine in his system a pathologist said it was the most he had seen in his 25 year career. \nMr Porter, a labourer from Little Hulton, Salford, Greater Manchester had been prescribed the powerful medication by doctors to help with severe back pain which he had suffered from ever since the age of 13, as well as a more recent broken toe. \nOn the weeks leading up to his death, Ty had been in significant pain but was planning to book a holiday with his daughter as soon as he made a recovery - which he remained positive that he would. \nBut, Ty, known by his family as ‘Russ’ was found unresponsive by his step-father Thomas and paramedics later confirmed that he had passed away in his sleep. Ty had suffered from a bad back since the age of 13 (Photo: Cavendish Press) \nHis family insisted that Ty would never intentionally take his own life and was always sensible and would only take Morphine when required. \nThey believe that his consistent lack of appetite - which he had suffered with for years - and use of the drug should have been more widely monitored by GP’s. \nPorter’s mother Joan Porter told a Bolton inquest: “When he was 13-years-old his back seized up. After a few weeks he started to make a recovery but the problems returned and he was in a lot of pain. Ty suffered from \"significant\" back pain (Photo: Cavendish Press) \n“Eighteen months before his death he broke his foot caused by him jumping from a window at his girlfriend’s house. \n\"He was in a cast for months because the bones in his foot did not heal properly. He was in significant pain from his back and his foot and was given strong pain killers. \n“He was good at taking the medication regularly and when he needed it and regularly attended hospital to get help. Tributes to Ty Porter (Photo: Cavendish Press) \n\"He had a problem with his appetite for years and would sometimes go two or three days without eating anything. \n“But about 18 months ago he did begin to lose a significant amount of weight and I told him to go and see his GP. \n\"His GP didn’t prescribe anything for him and did not advise him about the Morphine he was taking. Ty had lost a lot of weight leading up to his death (Photo: Cavendish Press) \n“On the days leading up to his death he had been in a lot of pain and stayed in his room a lot of the time. \n\"The day before he died he took a swig of my medicine from the bottle and on our way to bed, Tom checked on Russ and he seemed to be normal.” \nPathologist Dr Gordon Armstrong told the hearing: “The level of Morphine was very high - around 9,050mg of Morphine were present in the body. Tributes to Ty Porter (Photo: Cavendish Press) \n\"This is the highest level of Morphine I have seen in someone’s body in my 25 years of practise. \n\"The effects of Morphine can depress brain function causing drowsiness and confusion and could explain some of the symptoms Russ displayed prior to his death. \n“It is likely he would have fallen unconscious and passed away in his sleep.” \nRecording a narrative verdict, Senior Coroner Jennifer Leeming told the hearing: “I think this was a tragic accident. It can only be explained as that of an accident.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:53:30.488+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
