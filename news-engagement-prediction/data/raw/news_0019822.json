Massive Hawaiian lava ‘fire hose’ pouring into ocean Story continues below \nOnce the molten lava comes into contact with the ocean, an explosive reaction occurs that can send debris flying. New land is formed after the interaction occurs. Officials say it is not advisable to get anywhere near the interaction due to the explosive reaction, and also because the new land can be unstable and chunks can break off into the ocean. \nSometimes the lava flows can be so expansive they pose a risk to Hawaiian communities and even burn down houses if they come in contact with each other. \nThe U.S. Geological Survey said it would continue to monitor the site and assess any possible hazards. © 2017 Thomson Reuters ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T06:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T09:11:20.559+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
