The action title is expected by March 31, 2018, when the company’s 2017 fiscal year ends. EA CEO Andrew Wilson teased details about the game, which is being worked on by members of the Mass Effect franchise. The game will have an online component of some kind, encouraging players to interact in a completely new setting. “It’s an action-adventure, not RPG,” Wilson added during the Q&A portion of the call. That’s a change of pace for BioWare, which is best known for its role-playing game franchises. Studio fans can still expect to see “the great RPG character development and story progression that BioWare is known for,” Wilson continued. That’s about all we know about the BioWare game, however. BioWare vice president Aaryn Flynn included further details in a blog post on the studio’s website following the call. “In 2012, we began crafting a new universe full of new characters, stories, and gameplay,” Flynn wrote. “Our ambition is simple: Draw upon 20+ years of development knowledge and lessons to create something fun and new for you to enjoy with your friends.” More details are coming in the future, Flynn added. BioWare fans can expect a game from the studio much sooner. The next installment in the studio’s hugely popular space opera franchise, Mass Effect: Andromeda , launches March 21.
