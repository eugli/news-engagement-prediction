Over time, airborne black carbon particles (from soot or automobile emissions, for example) or other mineral dust can travel long distances in the atmosphere and settle on snow and glaciers, lowering the overall albedo. \nTo study the localized effects of coal dust on an area with high spectral reflectance, CU Boulder researchers focused on an active coal mine in Svalbard, Norway, located on a sparsely populated island north of the Arctic Circle. The researchers collected snow and ice samples from four sites at varying distances from the mine, with some samples being visibly dirtier than others. \nThe researchers then measured the light absorption capacity of each sample, adjusting for environmental factors such as snow grain size and location relative to the mine. Overall, the study concluded that coal dust had a strong but localized effect, reducing the albedo in the immediate area by up to 84 percent. \nThe findings may provide a foundation for similar research using satellites and remote sensing techniques in far-flung areas. \n“The extreme contrast between snow and dust at this particular site gave us a baseline to develop algorithms that we can now use to take future measurements in areas that aren’t easily accessible,” said lead study author Alia Khan, a post-doctoral researcher in CU Boulder’s National Snow and Ice Data Center and former graduate student at the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR) . \nCollecting spectral reflectance measurements of surface snow with corresponding snow samples next to Mine 7 near Longyearbyen, Svalbard.
