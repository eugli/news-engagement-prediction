The adorable 5-year-old channeled Prince in a hot pink pantsuit with a ruffled blouse reminiscent of the late music legend. She accessorized #flawlessly with a matching manicure and a shimmery clutch. \nThen, there was the cute moment she shared with papa Jay. The doting dad couldn't help but plant a sweet smooch on Blue's cheek as they watched the event from the front row (because, duh). Blue Ivy Carter's reaction to her mom's performance is the CUTEST. #Grammys pic.twitter.com/VXiqszl4vl — ELLE Magazine (US) (@ELLEmagazine) February 13, 2017 Read \nGrammy Awards 2017 Winners: The Complete List When it came time for mama Bey's show-stopping performance of \"Love Drought\" and \"Sandcastles,\" Blue was the proudest one in the crowd as she jumped up from her seat to cheer with a big smile on her face. But Beyoncé wasn't the only one who brought Miss Carter to her feet. Blue seemed to be having a blast during Bruno Mars ' energetic performance of \"That's What I Like\" as she snapped and moved her hips to the beat. Along with dancing, Blue also had no problem socializing with her parents' famous friends. She chatted up host James Corden and gave him a high five before making a delightful cameo in his hilarious Carpool Karaoke moment with Jennifer Lopez , John Legend , Jason Derulo , Keith Urban , Tim McGraw and Faith Hill .

And if that wasn't enough, she was later seen hanging out with Rihanna and meeting Nick Jonas !
