Source: Channel 7 Steph Rice talks about Grant Hackett \nThe Australian triple Olympic gold medallist spoke to Channel 7's The Morning Show, where she elaborated on her own struggles since giving up her career in the pool. \n\"Everyone knew me as Stephanie Rice the swimmer so take away the 'swimmer' part and it's just 'who is Stephanie Rice?'\" she said. \n\"Those were the confronting questions that I had to ask myself. It obviously requires some vulnerability to not always appear like you've got it together and I think as an athlete and a role model you think you have to have it all together.\" \nRice has come out in support of fellow Olympic champion Grant Hackett, whose own problems have been well documented.

Hackett has come out saying he will seek mental health treatment.

Doing that post on social media the other day I had so much positive traction and it felt so good to know that I was able to share and contribute to other people's mental wellness,\" Rice added. \n\"But I do think itâ€™s a journey you have to go on internally and seek support systems around you.\" Rice says a crisis of identity can affect many former athletes. Pic: Getty \nRice weighed into the discussion around Hackett last week with a heartfelt statement on social media about her own experiences. \n\"I was trying to find an appropriate picture to sum up my thoughts of today, but decided a quote was better,\" Rice wrote. \n\"Going through my transition after swimming was incredibly tough. It wasn't until about a year after finishing my athletic career when all the dust settled, and the realisation of no longer being 'current' and recognised for being the best at something set in. \n\"Achieving such high levels of success in sport brings about wonderful opportunities which are usually all based on external gratifications. So when you take away the vehicle in which you receive this recognition it definitely has a huge hit on your self-worth. \n\"I believe it's incredibly important to take the time to develop and work on your self from the inside out. \n\"Asking yourself the tough questions like, 'What is my purpose? What's my worth? What do I value?' can be confronting and make you feel vulnerable, but once you can look at those demons of insecurity head on and dig deep within yourself, it opens up a whole new world. The quote that Rice used to sum up her feelings. Pic: Instagram \n\"Take the time to quieten your outside world and work on yourself. All the answers you seek can be found within. \n\"Learn to forgive yourself and trust that there are gems of wonderful opportunity that can only come from enduring and overcoming the hardest times. \n\"Sending love and light to you all and I truly hope this post gives you a small insight to some of the struggles that top level athletes may go through. \n\"Please be gentle on yourselves and on others, as you never really know what's going on inside someone's else's head.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T11:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:38:49.344+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
