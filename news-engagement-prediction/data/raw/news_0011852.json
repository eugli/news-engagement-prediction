It added that four pilots were on board, as well as 15 cabin crew, who served 1,100 hot drinks, 2,000 cold drinks and 1,036 meals to passengers. #QR920 about 1 hour away from @AKL_Airport after 14.5 hours in the air. https://t.co/ISlPMLJ8CH #AucklandTogether pic.twitter.com/2pvUnIrFry — Flightradar24 (@flightradar24) February 5, 2017 \nThe title of “world’s longest flight” seems to be a sought-after accolade within the airline industry. Last year, Air India appeared to have seized the mantle when it switched the direction of its Delhi-San Francisco service , flying over the Pacific instead of the Atlantic to take advantage of favourable jet streams (it still flies via the Atlantic on the return leg). The change increased the journey’s total distance, according to Air India, from 8,673 miles (13,900km) to 9,506 miles (15,300km). However, the distance between to two cities is only 7,668 miles (12,341km), according to Google Maps, compared to the 9,028 miles (14,529km) that separate Doha and Auckland, so Qatar Airways has a far more solid claim to the record.

The two cities are 9,521 miles (15,323km) apart, according to Google Maps.
