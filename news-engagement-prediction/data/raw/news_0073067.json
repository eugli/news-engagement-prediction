At tonight’s Oscars, host Jimmy Kimmel set the stage for an overtly political awards ceremony—by no means the first —during his opening monologue, when he referenced Ivanka Trump’s embattled clothing line, her father’s bowel movements, and the President’s tweets about how Meryl Streeps is totally overrated. Political moments throughout the ceremony were somewhat more earnest, which is probably for the best. Below, some of the most notable: Blue ribbons for the ACLU The protest got underway even before Kimmel took the stage, when several A-listers—Ruth Negga, Karlie Kloss, Lin Manuel Miranda, Lin Manuel Miranda’s mom—showed up on the red carpet wearing (gasp!) the exact same thing: blue ribbons that broadcasted their support for the American Civil Liberties Union. Asghar Farhadi boycotts the Oscars When The Salesman won Best Foreign Language Film, its Iranian director Asghar Farhadi, wasn’t in attendance to accept the award. In his stead, two surrogates—Anousheh Ansari, the first Muslim woman in space, and Firouz Naderi, a former director at NASA—took the stage, and read a letter from Farhadi: “My absence is out of respect for the people of my country and those of other six nations whom have been disrespected by the inhumane law that bans entry of immigrants to the U.S. Dividing the world into the 'us’ and 'our enemies’ categories creates fear—a deceitful justification for aggression and war. These wars prevent democracy and human rights in countries which have themselves been victims of aggression. Filmmakers can turn their cameras to capture shared human qualities and break stereotypes of various nationalities and religions. They create empathy between us and others. An empathy which we need today more than ever.” Amen. Gael Garcia Bernal says no to walls Presenting the award for Best Animated Feature Film alongside Hailee Steinfeld, Gael Garcia Bernal seemed to go off script, declaring his solidarity, as an actor, with migrant workers (this part was maybe a stretch?), and his disapproval of Trump’s favorite campaign promise (this part we could very much get behind, as could the crowd, which gave Garcia Bernal a big round of applause): “Flesh and blood actors are migrant workers; we travel all over the world, we build families, we construct stories, we build life that cannot be divided,” declared the actor. “As a Mexican, as a Latin American, as a migrant worker, as a human being, I’m against any form of wall that wants to separate us.” Barry Jenkins and Terrell McCraney say yes to more representation When Moonlight won the Best Adapted Screenplay award, Writer/Director Barry Jenkins, rocking a blue ribbon, and playwright Tarell Alvin McCraney, wearing a red ribbon symbolizing the fight against AIDS, delivered a one-two punch of an acceptance speech. “All you people out here who feel there’s no mirror for you, that your life is not reflected,” Jenkins began. “The Academy has your back, the ACLU has your back, we have your back, and for the next four years we will not leave you alone, we will not forget you.” McCraney added: “This goes out to all those black and brown boys and girls and non gender-conforming, who don’t see themselves, we’re trying to show them you and us. So thank you, thank you, this is for you.” Warren Beatty speaks out on behalf of diversity and truth Few who stuck it out to the end of the Academy Awards will remember Warren Beatty's introduction to the montage of best picture nominees (far more memorable was the fiasco that followed). But Beatty's words bear repeating: \"It could be said that our goal in politics is the same as our goal in art, which is to get to truth. The movies that we honor tonight not only entertain us and move us, they show us the increasing diversity in our community and a respect for diversity and freedom all over the world.\" In This Story: Oscars ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T12:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T07:46:22.652+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
