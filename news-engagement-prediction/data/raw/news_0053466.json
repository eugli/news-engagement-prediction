Read more Well done, Mumbai. 55% voters step out, record highest turnout in 25 years \nTake the elite Malabar Hill, for instance. It posted a 48.17% voter turnout on Tuesday, up from 41.11% in 2012. \nThe biggest jump in voting in the city came from the western suburb of Borivli, with 61%, and the central suburb of Matunga and Wadala, at 58%. \nIn Mulund, the turnout was 60%. These areas saw a hike in turnout from around 42.58%, 41.90% and 47.78% respectively. \nThese surburbs were seen as BJP strongholds that have been dominated by Gujaratis, middle-class Maharashtrians and south Indians. \nThe Marathi strongholds of Worli, which saw 53% voters turning up to vote, Mahim (54%) and Parel (55.27%), also saw high voting, even if not as high as the areas like Mulund and Borivli. \nThe surge in voting was 7 to 10 percentage points in these areas seen as traditional Sena bastions.

In this case, Shiv Sena, which has been ruling the civic body for the past 25 years, may have a reason to worry and the BJP, which successfully took over the space of the opposition after the allies snapped ties this year, could benefit. \nThe BJP, however, has a lot of ground to cover, as it had only 31 corporators in the BMC. To emerge as the single-largest party, the BJP will need a three-fold increase in the number of seats it wins this time around. \nPolitical observers said one of the primary reasons for the high voter turnout is the Sena and BJP having worked overtime to get their “committed voter” to cast votes. “It seems the sharply polarised poll fight between the Sena and the BJP has ensured that both worked on mobilising their voters, leading to an overall surge,” said Prakash Bal, political analyst. \n“Is it a vote for change, or of community and party polarisation? One can’t be sure about that right now.” \nThe India Today-Axis exit polls indicated a close contest, with the Sena predicted to win 86 to 92 seats and the BJP coming a close second with 80 to 88 seats. The Congress would be a distant third with 30 to 34 seats. The exit poll also predicted that Sena would get a clear majority in Thane, while the BJP would win the Pune and Nagpur civic bodies.

Its president Ashish Shelar said the high voter turnout has always been indicative of a vote for change. It will work in his party’s favour, Shelar said. \nBut, even within the party’s inner most circles, there is no surety of whether such a surge will actually translate into the BJP emerging as the largest party. \n“It is clear there was a very close contest between the BJP and the Shiv Sena, but what’s not clear is how this will get played out in the results. Only on Thursday will we know which party will emerge as the leading party,” said a senior BJP leader. \n“We know that we will have a big jump from our earlier tally of just 31 seats.. that is a given,” the leader said. The party did not expect this kind of a voting surge but it was confident of having mobilised its vote bank. The overall voting percentage also points to a sharply polarised poll battle between the Shiv Sena and the BJP. \nThis seems to have marginalised the Congress and reduced other parties, including the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) further to the sidelines. \nInterestingly, even in slum dominated areas like Mankhurd and the minority dominated areas, saw a visibly high turn out — a jump of around 7 per centage points. With AIMIM contesting for minority vote bank along with Congress, however, this advantage may not go to the latter as expected. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T14:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:12:10.558+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
