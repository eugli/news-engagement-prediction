WQI is represented in colour bands. The study was made public on Friday. \nAs per the National Sanitation Foundation, USA that developed WQI – a standardised method to compare water quality of various water bodies, a WQI reading between 63 and 100 falls under the ‘good to excellent’ category denoted by the colour green, 50-63 is ‘medium to good’ (yellow), 38-50 is recorded as ‘bad’ (orange) while 38 and below is identified as ‘bad to very bad’ (red). \n“We had been accumulating data since 2004. However, we decided to come out with a precise number to identify water quality to the public through this study. The idea is to introduce WQI for awareness purposes for local municipal corporations or other bodies to take stock of pollution levels at nearby water bodies,” said a senior official from MPCB’s water quality department. \nOf the 188 locations, the study observed 164 or 87.3% locations fell under the categories of ‘good to excellent’ (112 sites) and ‘medium to good’ (52 sites). WQI values for 16 locations or 8.5% of the total number fell under the ‘bad’ category, which included the six locations from Mumbai, six locations from Pune and four from Raigad and Thane. Eight remaining locations in Raigad, Thane and Palghar were identified to have the worst water quality under the ‘bad to very bad’ category. \nMPCB officials said 80% of the pollution source for Mumbai, Pune, Thane and Raigad was untreated domestic waste. “We observed that the coastline along megacities like Mumbai and rivers and lakes in smaller cities had an inflow of sewage that is being channeled through nullahs to the water bodies,” said the official. “The remaining 20% pollutant source consisted of a small quantity of oil, industrial effluents and rest was natural sources arising from the base of water bodies.” \nThe official said meetings had already being held with 37 local bodies across the state to treat their sewage at source. “While Mumbai still has a good sewage treatment facility, other cities need to ensure they treat their sewage through MPCB approved treatment facilities,” he said. “Awareness drives have been conducted and directives have been issued to municipal corporations. We expect that the index will change towards the fairer side through a similar study within a year or two.” \nWhat is WQI? \nA water quality index provides a single number (grade) that expresses overall water quality of a certain water sample (location and time specific) for several water quality parameters. A water index is based on important parameters, which provides a simple indicator of water quality and a general idea on the possible problems with the water at a particular region. \nInterpretation of Water Quality Index – Surface Water WQI \nClass (as per Central Pollution Control Board) \nRemarks ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T16:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T06:56:14.460+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
