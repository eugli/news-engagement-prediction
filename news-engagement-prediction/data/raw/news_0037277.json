Michael Finnegan \nFlooding shut down the 5 Freeway in the San Fernando Valley and the 110 in South Los Angeles on Friday, forcing rush hour motorists to seek alternatives to the two transit arteries. \nWater pooled more than two-and-a-half feet deep on both sides of the 5 in Sun Valley. The flooding stopped traffic in both directions, just south of the Hollywood Freeway, said Officer Stephan Brandt of the California Highway Patrol. \n“People were going through and getting stuck,” he said. \nTelevision stations showed video of abandoned cars submerged to the top of the hood, in the middle of the freeway. \nOn the 8600 block of San Fernando Road, 10 vehicles were stuck in the water. More than a dozen firefighters had to rescue at least eight people trapped by the fast moving water, according to the city fire department. \nFlooding also blocked traffic on the southbound 110 at Slauson Ave. and the northbound 110 at Vernon Ave., Brandt said.
