'Lower prices' \n\"US drug companies have produced extraordinary results for our country but the pricing has been astronomical for our country, we have to do better,\" Mr Trump told them in the meeting. \n\"We have to get even better innovation, and I want you to move your companies back to the United States,\" he said. \nTo help the firms, Mr Trump said his administration was \"going to be lowering taxes big league\". \n\"We're going to be getting rid of regulations that are unnecessary - big league,\" he added. Job boost \nThe president's promise to speed up approvals by the Food and Drug Administration for new medicines sparked strong gains in pharmaceutical shares. \nShares in Merck and Amgen rose by about 1% while Novartis was up more than 2% on Wall Street. \nThe Nasdaq Biotech Index gained nearly 3% after the meeting and the S&P 500 health care index rose 1.4%. \nInvestors had sold off shares in drugmakers in recent weeks following heavy criticism from Mr Trump - supported by Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders - over drug pricing. \nHowever, senior pharmaceutical executives welcomed Mr Trump's proposals on Tuesday to cut taxes and loosen regulations. \n\"We believe if these policies are enacted, it will translate to up to 350,000 new jobs over the next 10 years as a result of growth in the biopharmaceutical industry,\" said Stephen J. Ubl, chief executive of PhRMA. \nAmgen chief executive, Robert Brad, said in the meeting that his firm would add 1,600 jobs in the US - a move welcomed by the president.
