The Cupertino major typically holds the WWDC in San Francisco. \nThe conference kicks off June 5, and \"will inspire developers from all walks of life to turn their passions into the next great innovations and apps that customers use every day across iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV and Mac,\" the company announced in a press statement. Registration for tickets will start on March 27, Apple further announced. \nApple is known to unveil the next major iterations of its software operating systems at WWDC. This year, it is expected to take the wraps off iOS 11 and macOS 10.13 respectively. Additionally, the company may announce updates to tvOS and watchOS. \n\"The conference will be live-streamed through the Apple Developer website (developer.apple.com/wwdc) and on the WWDC app for iPhone, iPad and Apple TV,\" Apple informed. \n2017 is going to be an eventful year since it marks the iPhone's 10th anniversary. Apple is reportedly working on a special edition iPhone 8, for the year, which is expected to come with some top-tier specs (and some real cool tech) and an atrociously high price tag of 1000$. Once announced, the iOS 11 will be part of the iPhone 8 (and the rumoured iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus) on launch, although the update should trickle down to its other iPhones soon enough. \nAt WWDC last year, Apple previewed the new messaging features for iMessage alongside a much talked about redesign to Apple Music. The most widely speculated aspect of the upcoming iOS 11 is said to be the fact that it would render older 32-bit apps obsolete. Tens of thousands of apps could be affected in the process as developers will then have to make their apps compatible with 64-bit architecture.
