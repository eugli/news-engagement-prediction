The embassy has been kept informed of developments related to the matter as well as the processes involved under Malaysian law. \n“For these reasons, the Malaysian Government views the criticism made by the Ambassador of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea as baseless,” the statement added. \nWhen contacted, Malaysia’s Ambassador to North Korea Mohamad Nizan Mohamad said he will likely be flying back to Malaysia today to consult with Wisma Putra on the matter. \nAsked if he had been summoned by North Korea’s f \n“ \n“ \n“We have mentioned our position, and they have mentioned theirs on the matter,” Mohamad Nizan told The Star \nIt is understood that Mohamad Nizan has been recalled as the Malaysian Government is unhappy over Kang’", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T03:07:03.268+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
