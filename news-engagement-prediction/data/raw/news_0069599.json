In his last decade onscreen, the 67-year-old actor has spent more time walking the streets of the Big Apple than people who actually live there. His roles have included some of the most daring, textured work in his career: The Hoax , Brooklyn’s Finest , Arbitrage , and especially Oren Moverman’s remarkable Time Out of Mind , which was shot largely with zoom lenses, allowing Gere to blend into unsuspecting city crowds for his portrayal of a homeless man.
