Many young people watching and thinking it's cool.”\nA third viewer said: “That cocaine joke seriously, went a bit far.”\nA fourth commented: \"Erm sorry don't agree with airing the whole snorting scene.. Don't care if it's only sugar.\"\nOther viewers found the joke hilarious (Photo: Channel 5) A rep for CBB told Mirror Celeb tonight: \"It was part of a task and sugar.\"\nThere was no further comment.\nNot all viewers found it shocking, however, and some took to Twitter to say they found the scene hilarious.\nOne said: \"Nicola and Jedward snorting lines of sugar is hilarious.\"\nAnother agreed: \"I'm sorry, but doing lines of sugar is fucking hilarious.\"\nA third viewer said: \"People moaning cause of a few lines of sugar, it's a joke that what real rockstars are like lol.\"\nAnother said: \"Here's comes the fun police moaning about them pretending to do sugar on CBB .\"\nKim took the sugar away (Photo: Channel 5)\nKim Woodburn hadn’t been happy with the joke, telling Jedward it wasn’t allowed and taking the plate of sugar away from them.\n“I’m sorry,” she said. “But you know perfectly well that’s not allowed. Behave yourself. There’s none of this nonsense.”\nJedward shouted back: “We don’t need that stuff! We’re trying to be rockstars! We’re a family orientated band and would never touch any white substances unless it’s snow. Snow all the way for us!”\n*CBB continues tomorrow at 9pm on Channel 5\nRead More CBB contestants 2017 James Cosmo Angie Best Stacy Francis Brandon Block Coleen Nolan Jasmine Waltz Ray J Calum Best Nicola McLean Jamie O'Hara Bianca Gascoigne Austin Armacost James Jordan Spencer and Heidi Pratt Full CBB line-up 2017 CBB contestants latest news Celebs Newsletter Follow @MirrorTV Subscribe to our Celebs Celebrity Big Brother Reality shows", "external_links": ["https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/trinity-images/logos/mirror.png", "http://i1.irishmirror.ie/incoming/article9560315.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/Celebrity-Big-Brother-2017.jpg", "http://i4.irishmirror.ie/incoming/article9560323.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/Celebrity-Big-Brother-2017.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MirrorTV", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "http://i2.irishmirror.ie/incoming/article9560330.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/Celebrity-Big-Brother-2017.jpg", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/CBB?src=hash", "https://www.facebook.com/dailymirrortv", "http://i2.irishmirror.ie/incoming/article9560327.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/Celebrity-Big-Brother-Launch-Arrivals.jpg", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/1806/4221396001_5307132118001_5306959264001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://i4.irishmirror.ie/incoming/article9560321.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/Celebrity-Big-Brother-Launch-Arrivals.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-02T00:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T11:36:22.699+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
