The very definition is an ongoing subject of conversation within photographic circles (particularly photography as a fine art practice). \nFor many, a photograph is simply an image that captures an event/place/person as it occurred or looked in front of the lens. Even today, with an endless array of image-altering programs literally at our fingertips, there remains a degree of veracity associated with the photographic. \nWe expect photographs to represent the truth, even though we accept that they can easily be doctored. In this sense, the appearance of \"truthiness\" becomes a sufficient replacement for actuality. \nThe news cycle of the last few weeks suggests we now live in a world of \"alternative facts\" — free to choose what we want to believe and make excuses for, or disavow what we don't. Was the crowd large or small? Well, it depends on what images you choose to view, and which one you choose to believe. 'Parking' by Leigh Merrill, 21 x 24 inches framed, pigment print, 2016 \n(Courtesy of the Liliana Bloch Gallery) \nThe funny thing about photography is that it has always been a double-edged sword — both the powerful wizard and the man behind the curtain. \nPhotography's very origins are messy and combative, with different people creating different processes and utilizing them for different purposes near-simultaneously. From the earliest days, some practitioners used the medium in a painterly fashion, eschewing fine detail and accuracy for gauzy storytelling and fantastically staged tableaux. \nOthers leaned into its documentary properties, while also quickly deducing that slight staging or creative darkroom tinkering could amplify the \"look\" of a scene, laying the groundwork for a host of post-production techniques that play directly into fantasies of what the image should look like. \nTruth and lie go — and have always gone — hand-in-hand, the peanut butter and jelly sandwich of photography. 'Flower Field Variation 1' by Leigh Merrill, 44 x 44 inches framed, pigment print, 2016 \n( Courtesy of the Liliana Bloch Gallery) \nPhotographer Leigh Merrill 's body of work delights in this push-and-pull. \nAt first glance, her images seem familiar — empty urban spaces, luscious floral still lifes — but their delicacy gives way to unease. Colors are overly saturated, or eerily washed out. Elements seem out of place or time. Perfectly manicured landscapes become cloying and sinister, a smile turning into a grimace. \nMerrill achieves this duality through her expert wielding of editing software: Her images are composites of elements plucked from hundreds of photographs of actual places she has visited, pieced together to form new, non-existent spaces. 'Blue Crush 1' by Leigh Merrill, 21 x 23 inches framed, pigment print, 2016 \n(Courtesy of the Liliana Bloch Gallery) \nShe says, \"I often think about photography's relationship to the referent in my images. Although there is no physical referent in my photographs — since they are fictional spaces — they do echo cultural, historical, and perceptual forces that affect our built environment.\" \nFirst exhibited last year at Liliana Bloch Gallery , the series is part of a two-person exhibition currently on view at The Gallery at the University of Texas Arlington . In addition to her stunning images, Merrill's show includes a new video piece titled, Cloud Seeding . Featuring a looping shot of an expanding and contracting cloud, the video references the practice of weather modification in which the microphysical structure of a cloud is altered to achieve desired levels of precipitation. Artist Leigh Merrill photographed in her studio in Dallas (Nan Coulter/Special Contributor) \nThe cloud's pulsation gives it the appearance of a living, breathing entity, suspended in the air in a hyper-realized state of purpose. Rather than lazily drifting across the sky, this cloud is forced huff and puff for a greater purpose, a human-made purpose. \nLike Merrill's photographs, it's a subtle, yet poignant reminder that we are living in a world that is somehow both expanding and collapsing, with the spectrum of millions of individual wants and desires more than a singular world can accommodate.
