The second half we were better, we played with more drive and intensity. We relied on a couple of saves from Adam Davies. \n“In the first half weren’t at our best with the ball and when you’re not at your best without the ball you’re going to struggle. We were pleased to be in at 1-0 down at half-time and in the second half we were much better and played with a better energy but just not the quality.” \nHuddersfield boss David Wagner: \n“There’s nothing I can change, we have to accept it. It’s one point, we played very well, we deserved three points but their goalkeeper was in his very best from and we missed too many very good opportunities that we created. \n“The performance in how we created those chances and how we defended was very good. The mood is still positive because we performed and sometimes in football you don’t get what you deserved and today was such a day but we take the point and go forward. \n“I have got no complaints because I am very happy, we have performed today. Everything was perfect today except we didn’t take our chances. It makes no sense to think about it because it is football. We had four, five or six very big opportunities.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T05:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:18:25.184+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
