'And he stayed around until he got it from her. Cody will never understand what he has done to our family. Cody robbed her of her innocence. He destroyed the child left in her. This can never be returned.' However the legality of imposing a sex ban on the defendant has been questioned by some. Judge Randy Stoker sentenced Cody Duane Scott Herrera of Twin Falls, Idaho to five to 15 years in prison, but he suspended the sentence for a one-year therapeutic rider program Shaakirrah R. Sanders, an associate professor at the University of Idaho College of Law, said the probation condition might be unenforceable. 'I think it infringes on his constitutional rights,' she said. Sanders said judges have discretion in creating special probation terms, but they can't violate the federal or state constitution. 'I think if he appealed, he would win,' Sanders said. Prosecutors also revealed Herrera has had fantasies about a 13-year-old girl and watches pornography depicting rape. He could also face charges of sex with another underage girl.
