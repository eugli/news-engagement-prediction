Deane Riddick \nThe new track layout at the Waitara jetsprint track. \nHe's been plagued by breakdowns - like most jetsprint drivers - this year but is rearing to go come this weekend. Ad Feedback \n\"This sport is extremely hard on engines because you've got your foot flat to the board most of the time,\" he said. \n\"As opposed to rally where you're slowing down and speeding up, this is just full-throttle the whole time. ANDY JACKSON/Fairfax NZ \nWaitara's jetsprint track in its first national championship showcase in 2015. \n\"You need a bloody good engine to handle it.\" \nDespite racing on home-turf he hasn't had a chance to get in a practice at the Joll St track, so he'll be going in on-par with the other competitors. \nTrack owner and driver Leighton Minnell won't be racing the iconic Taranaki Hardcore boat due to a breakdown, but he'll be there to cheer his wife Kellie on from the sidelines. \n\"She's actually coming in fourth for the group B's at the moment, I think there were a few dropped-lips that the only all-girls team is putting the pressure on the men,\" he said. \nRound one of the championship was hosted at the track in December but after some issues getting consent for the track in Wairarapa, Taranaki was given two-rounds of the competition. \nMinnell said Marshall was known as Neil \"Big Deal\" in New Plymouth, and was happy to see such a large representation of Taranaki-based teams in the championship. \n\"He's well-known from the Tarmac Rally and now he's carving up on the water,\" he said. \nMinnell is hopeful the weather will hold for the predicted sunny Sunday as last time round rain impacted the number crowd-members willing to sit in the rain. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:01:13.262+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
