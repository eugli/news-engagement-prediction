Kevin Winter/Getty \nWarner Bros. is courting recent Oscar nominee Mel Gibson to helm its \"Suicide Squad\" sequel, according to The Hollywood Reporter . \nSources tell the trade that the studio and Gibson are in early talks and no offer has been made to the actor/director. \nBut this is the latest indication that Gibson is back in the good graces of Hollywood after a decade of being an outsider following a 2006 DUI arrest and now-infamous anti-Semitic rant while being put into police custody. \nHis latest directing effort, \"Hacksaw Ridge,\" was well received by critics and went on to make over $100 million worldwide at the box office. The movie received six Oscar nominations, including best picture, best actor (Andrew Garfield), and best director for Gibson. \n\"Suicide Squad.\" Warner Bros. \nThe renewed interest in Gibson makes sense for Warner Bros. as the first \"Suicide Squad\" movie directed by David Ayer, though it made over $745 million worldwide , was filled with reported issues during production . Perhaps WB is looking for a more experienced helmer. But at the same time, the movies Gibson has directed have been produced outside of the studio system, Will he play nice on a project that is vital for a studio? \nIt sounds like there's still a lot of talking to be had before a decision is made (THR also reports that director Daniel Espinosa of the upcoming sci-fi movie \"Life\" is also on their list). But this might not be the only superhero franchise that wants Gibson. \nRobert Downey Jr. has been campaigning for years to get Gibson to direct an \"Iron Man\" movie . The Gibson comeback might just make Marvel start to take RDJ's talk seriously. \nA representative for Gibson had no comment for this story when contacted by Business Insider, and Warner Bros. did not give an immediate response.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T21:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T17:04:05.545+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
