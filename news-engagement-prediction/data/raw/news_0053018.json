Disassembling the phones and reusing the components would be the quickest way for Samsung to recuperate some of the money it lost, but it looks like Samsung has a better idea – refurbishing the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 with smaller batteries and selling the phones in emerging markets. \nA report out of Korea claims that Samsung has plans to swap out the faulty batteries which caused the Note 7 to explode with a smaller 3,000 – 3,200mAh batteries. To ensure the new batteries fit properly, Samsung would also be fitting the phones with a new case. The devices would then be sold in India, Vietnam and other emerging markets, presumably at a highly-discounted price. The refurbished Note 7 would likely be available starting in June of 2017. \nIt’s not clear is Samsung is planning to refurbish all of the 3 million Note 7 units which have been returned, but the company could easily recuperate half a billion dollars if it sold 2 million of the devices for $250 each. \nIf the price is right, would you buy a refurbished Samsung Galaxy Note 7?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T16:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T11:58:23.089+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
