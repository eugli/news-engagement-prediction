It was built between 1924 and 1927 by cereal heiress and socialite Marjorie Merriweather Post. Post, who died in 1973, bequeathed the mansion to the U.S. government for use as a warm-weather retreat for the president. However, the government returned the donation to Post’s daughters in 1980 due to the annual maintenance cost, which exceeded $1 million. That same year, the estate was declared a National Historic Landmark. Donald Trump purchased the property, which he would later dub the “Winter White House,” in 1985 for $5 million and used it solely as a private residence until turning it into a private members-only club in 1995. Trump built a 20,000-square-foot ballroom coated with $7 million in gold leaf and spent $100,00 on four gold-plated sinks. The Mar-a-Lago Club also boasts an oceanfront swimming pool, a beauty salon, a spa, five red clay tennis courts, a croquet court, and seaside cabanas. And the property has two retail outlets: a tennis pro shop overlooking Lake Worth and a boutique adjacent to the Trump Spa.
