(Susan Walsh / AP) Brady Dennis, Steven Mufson The Washington Post \nIn his previous role as Oklahoma's attorney general, the Environmental Protection Agency 's new administrator regularly huddled with fossil fuel firms and electric utilities about how to combat federal environmental regulations and spoke to conservative political groups about what they call government\" overreach,\" according to thousands of pages of emails released Wednesday. \n\"The newly released emails reveal a close and friendly relationship between Scott Pruitt 's office and the fossil fuel industry, with frequent meetings, calls, dinners and other events,\" said Nick Surgey, research director for the Center for Media and Democracy, which has sued to compel the release of the emails. \nThe emails highlight an often-chummy relationship between Pruitt's office and Devon Energy, a major oil and gas exploration and production company based in Oklahoma City. The correspondence makes clear that top officials at the company met often with Pruitt or people who worked for him. Devon representatives also helped draft -- and re-draft -- letters for Pruitt to sign and send federal officials in an effort to stave off new regulations. \n\"Any suggestions?\" a deputy solicitor general in Pruitt's office wrote to a Devon executive in early May 2013, including a draft of a letter the office was planning to send to the EPA regarding proposed regulations of methane emissions. \n\"Here you go,\" the executive, Bill Whitsitt replied. \"Please note that you could use just the red changes, or both red and blue (the latter being some further improvements from one of our experts) or none.\" \n\"I sent the letter today,\" the deputy solicitor general wrote the following day. \"Thanks for all your help on this.\" Environmental Protection Agency , Scott Pruitt made clear Monday that he intends to step back from what he sees as the agency's regulatory overreach during the Obama administration.\nPruitt, who spent years criticizing and suing the EPA before becoming... \nIn his first full work day as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency , Scott Pruitt made clear Monday that he intends to step back from what he sees as the agency's regulatory overreach during the Obama administration. \nPruitt, who spent years criticizing and suing the EPA before becoming... (Brady Dennis, Chris Mooney) \nThe emails show that Pruitt and his office were in touch with a network of ultra-conservative groups, many of which in the past have received backing from billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch , the libertarian owners of Koch Industries, a major oil company. The documents detail not only how Pruitt's office at times coordinated with industry officials to fight unwanted regulations from Washington, but also how he was a highly sought after speaker at conferences and other gatherings for groups such as the American Legislative Exchange Council, which works with corporate interests and state legislators to shape key pieces of legislation. \nIn one example, Pruitt was a speaker at an ALEC conference on May 3, 2013, in Oklahoma City. He was part of a panel called, \"Embracing American Energy Opportunities: From Wellheads to Pipelines.\" The event also featured a reception at the Petroleum Club and a luncheon sponsored by Koch Industries. \nThe Oklahoma attorney general's office handed over the batch of emails -- nearly 7,000 pages in all -- this week in order to meet a deadline set by a judge who ordered the documents' release following more than two years of effort by CMD, a liberal watchdog organization. The group had sued to compel the state to release the documents under public records laws. (The emails can be viewed here .) \nThough the emails show Pruitt's ties with a wide range of fossil fuel interests and conservative political groups, they show a particularly close relationship with Devon Energy, a major oil and gas exploration and production company based in Oklahoma City. Much of the correspondence revolves around arranging speaking engagements, obtaining contact information for people at the federal Office of Management and Budget and coordinating letter-writing efforts. \nAt one point, Pruitt's then-chief of staff, Melissa Houston, wrote in a Jan. 9, 2013, email to Whitsitt, Devon's vice president for public affairs, \"You are so amazingly helpful!!! Thank you so much!!!\" \nIn another email chain on March 21, 2013, Whitsitt wrote to Pruitt's office offering a draft of a letter that state attorneys general might sign and send to the then-acting EPA administrator regarding limits on methane emissions. Devon, which has substantial shale gas and shale oil drilling operations, would have been affected by the rule. \n\"Attached is a potential first-cut draft of a letter a (bipartisan if possible?) group of AGs might send to the acting EPA administrator and some others in the Administration in response to the NE states' notice of intent to sue for more E&P emission regulation,\" Whitsitt wrote. \"It would be a shot across the bow, warning EPA not to not go down a negotiated-rulemaking or wink-at-a sue-and-settle tee-up process.\" \nThe company vice president gave strategic advice, too. \"If sent, I'd suggest that it be made public, at least to the Hill and to policy community publications,\" he wrote. \"It seems to me this would also be a logical outgrowth of the fossil energy AGs meeting and could be powerful with a number of signers. It is also the kind of thing that in the future could be run through the clearinghouse we discussed. Please let me know what you and General Pruitt think, or if we can help further.\" \nThat same month, Whitsitt also offered a draft of a letter for Pruitt to sign about the federal Bureau of Land Management's revised proposal of a rule on hydraulic fracturing, a drilling technique that has helped U.S. companies like Devon sharply expand output and profits. Following up on his conversations with Pruitt, Whitsitt suggested a meeting \"or perhaps more efficient, a conference call\" with OMB officials. \n\"The attached draft letter (or something like it that Scott if comfortable talking from and sending to the acting director to whom the letter is addressed) could be the basis for the meeting or call,\" he wrote. \nPruitt's chief of staff replied: \"Thanks Bill - we will take a look and start working on a draft.\" \nPruitt's close ties to Devon Energy were first highlighted in 2014 by the New York Times, which reported that a letter ostensibly written by the attorney general alleging that the EPA overestimated air pollution from natural gas drilling was actually written by the company's attorneys. \"That's actually called representative government in my view of the world,\" Pruitt later said of the letter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:05:15.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
