The pair managed to escape by climbing out of the open doors\nThe car ended up partially submerged in the icy pool\nThe car, a 2002 Lexus SE, went careening off the road and into a yard in the well-manicured suburb.\nTire tracks on the snowy ground show that the car, now over 100 feet off the road, continued on into another yard and swerved in a wide arc before plowing directly into a white wooden fence around the homeowner's pool.\nThe Lexus barreled through the fence and directly into the pool, deploying the front and side door airbags.\nPhotos of the scene also show the car's sunroof open, suggested the teens may have initially tried to escape through the roof of the Lexus\nUnable to open the doors due to the airbag deployment, the twins scrambled into the car's back seat as the car sank in the icy waters.\nPhotos of the scene also show the car's sunroof open, suggested the teens may have initially tried to escape through the roof of the Lexus\nThe teens opened the rear passenger door of the Lexus and slipped out into the pool, the Boston Herald reported .\nHomeowner Muhamed Alomar heard a sound 'like a bomb' while his wife was giving their three children breakfast.\nAlomar ran out back and saw the chaotic scene.\n'It's like dream, you know.
