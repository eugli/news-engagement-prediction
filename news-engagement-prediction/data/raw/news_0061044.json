The Armed Forces Covenant is not being enforced by the MoD and for Sir Michael Fallon to not even bother to make sure local councils stick to it makes the whole thing totally worthless. \n\"We put our lives on the line for Britain and yet the British Government can't even be bothered to make sure veterans have a place to live when they leave the service. \n\"We're being treated like s*** and it needs to stop. \n\"Does the Government carom ore about its own finances than the welfare of military veterans?\" GETTY Michael Fallon's Defence Ministry does not enforce the Armed Forces Covenant \nMr Kawczynski, 45, MP for Shrewsbury and Atcham, said: \"Britain's veterans put their lives on the line in defence of our great nation and I believe we need to do more to help them when they leave the forces. \n\"It doesn’t seem right that the MoD plans to sell off 56 sites to raise money yet isn’t making any provision in the sales for accommodation for homeless and, in some cases, traumatised veterans. \n\"The MoD must have a rethink and consider how they can use the Armed Forces Covenant when selling these assets to property developers, it is also important they make checks to ensure local councils are sticking to the covenant as well. \n\"This needs to change and I will be asking a question to the Secretary of State for Defence on this matter in Parliament on Monday.\" \nTim Barker, the Shropshire Councillor responsible for the Armed Forces Covenant, said: “Shropshire Council signed the Armed Forces Covenant in 2012 in a voluntary pledge of support for Shropshire’s Armed Forces communities. Shropshire is amongst the leading counties with regard to our Covenant work, which includes co-ordinating, facilitating and generally helping to harness the work of The Armed Forces, associated charities and ex-services personnel. \n“As a signatory to the Covenant the council endeavours to ensure that former members of the British Armed Forces are not disadvantaged with respect to access to affordable housing, and to ensure a reasonable supply of affordable housing is made available to them, though unfortunately this isn’t always in our hands. \n“The land at Copthorne Barracks does not belong to Shropshire Council but we will work with all partners, developers and the land owners to see what can be achieved at the site, including potential military provision, taking planning policy into account. SHROPSHIRECOUNCIL These are the plans submitted to Shropshire Council for the Copthorne barracks site \n“No-one wants to see anyone in housing need, military veteran or not. Of course, homelessness is not always associated purely with lack of housing but often other factors which individuals need help and assistance to deal with before long-term housing solutions can be found for them. In this regard Shropshire performs well, as can be witnessed by our performance in this area.” \nA spokesperson for the MoD told Express.co.uk the MoD does not enforce the Covenant at the point of sale because \"it needs to raise funds\" and confirmed there is no provision in place to check local authorities adhere to the document they signed.
