We’ve spent so long looking at those stories, we know how important it is. Even something like the fiduciary rule, which can seem like a luxury issue — that, in very meaningful ways, affects people’s lives down the line. Our researchers have been looking at the [hiring freeze on federal workers] — there’s a lot of veterans who are going to be adversely affected and they don’t even realize it yet. With some of these E.O.s [executive orders], it’s like a tsunami warning. You’re in real trouble and you don’t yet know because the sea looks calm. Do you accept the argument that late-night comedians helped Trump win, either by insulating Clinton voters from the possibility she could lose or egging on his supporters to vote for him? That is just a stick to hit someone with, knowing that it’s something that could hurt someone. What’s a thing that you like? I’ll attach something you don’t like to it. “Pancakes — this is why Trump won.” But I like pancakes! I’m not saying that comedians are not, by their nature, self-centered. But if you, as a comedian, think you got Donald Trump elected, you’re a sociopath. The election and its aftermath have brought attention to the problem of fake news. Do you think shows like “Last Week Tonight” contribute to this problem? \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The phrase “fake news” has now been used so liberally, it’s meaningless. The problem with aggregation is that the very act of aggregating a piece of information assumes that somewhere along the line, there was a level of fact-checking. We are very, very strict about making sure that every piece of information that we pass along, we fact-check independently. I do not, for a second, say that our sourcing is transferable across other political comedy shows. Mr. Trump has vociferously criticized the media — news outlets as well as comedy shows like “Saturday Night Live.” Do you fear he might actually try to retaliate against his critics? What he says about journalists is a serious, lasting concern. He has proven these threats are not entirely empty. They’re sometimes promises. But “S.N.L.” is a comedy show. What would he do, get “S.N.L.” taken off the air? “S.N.L.” is something he cares about. We are a meaningless mosquito that he barely hears buzzing by his ear. There is a nonzero chance that he’ll do anything. There’s a nonzero chance you and I are taken to the border this evening and deported as Mexicans. That’s probably not going to happen, but it’s not zero. [laughs] Do you feel as if you were seeing more TV journalists use some of the basic techniques “The Daily Show” developed, like juxtaposing video clips of an administration official contradicting himself? What you’re describing just seems like basic fact-checking to expose hypocrisy. I always find it pretty dispiriting if ever I see journalists trying to tell a joke. This is not your concern. Pick a lane. You don’t need to do this. Also, almost 100 percent of the time, you’re less funny than you think you are. Although, you could absolutely apply that to most comedians. [Laughs.] In all my working years at “The Daily Show,” whenever [a TV journalist] said, “I wish we could do what you guys do” — you can. Just don’t tell jokes at the end. Because you can’t, and you shouldn’t. Have you been approached about hosting the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner? Oh, no. God, no. That is just such a noxious concept. I have such contempt for that, as an evening. It would seem really [awful] to go and say, “This whole thing is a horrendous farce.” I don’t need to go and ruin their unearned evening of celebration. Any of that commentary, I can do on my own show.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T00:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T20:12:19.873+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
