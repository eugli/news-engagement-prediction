Arsene Wenger strode the touchline of the training pitch with a severe look on his face, knowing anything but a comfortable win in Sutton will put further pressure on his position. Wenger, who earlier this season had his 20th anniversary at Arsenal, has a contract which runs out at the end of the year, and it remains unclear whether his lengthy stay will be extended. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger looks on severely along with assistant manager Steve Bould Wenger's contract at Arsenal runs out this summer and his future is subject to speculation One thing Wenger does have in his favour is a strong squad to pick from to face Sutton, with almost all of them in training at St Albans. The most notable absentee was England forward Danny Welbeck, who instead was playing with the under-23 squad against Leicester City on Sunday afternoon. The reserve game was being played on a plastic 3G pitch, similar to the one used by Sutton at Gander Green Lane, and Welbeck's place in that game would perhaps indicate he is being prepared for a showing against the National League side. Danny Welbeck did not train with the first team on Sunday and instead played with the U23s Welbeck was deployed to the reserve game as it was played on a 3G pitch similar to Sutton's For the rest of the first team squad, it was an opportunity to get back in the manager's good books and shake off the nightmare that was the Munich debacle. Players who started that game, including Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and goalkeeper David Ospina, were in full flow ahead of the Monday night trip across from north to south London. Wenger is likely to select a mix of first-teamers and reserve options, knowing that a third FA Cup in four years now represents their best chance of silverware.
