Her phone is rammed with apps that help her save money, earn cashback or even get extra deals. \n“The main ones I use are Shopitize, TopCashBack and Checkoutsmart,” she explained. \n“You can sign up to an email alert system or if you have an iPhone or android then you can get a notification. They are all much of the same: you take a picture of the barcode and say how many you bought, then photograph your receipt and you earn cashback, which you can spend. \n“They all work on the same principle but they often have different offers so it’s worth signing up to more than one. I also use Shopmium, Greenjinn, Clicksnap… Sometimes they share offers and you can only use it once, but often they have different offers and I save a packet.” Serious savings What Sam got with a £5, no minimum spend voucher. That meant she could carry out multiple transactions totalling £5 and the voucher would still apply making all this free \nIt’s not just through apps that Sam saves cash, although she says they do a lot of the hard work for her. She has made finding bargains both a habit and a hobby, and one that really pays off. \n“I started looking online and I came across coupon pages. Then I started writing to companies and getting deals and vouchers as a thank you for my feedback – it’s so easy with email that I can’t imagine why everyone isn’t doing it,\" Sam said. \n“I get the supermarket magazines, which are always full of coupons that I make sure I use…You get into a routine – once a week I do a coupon shop.” Using a £5 off a £10 spend in meat voucher, coupled with a 3 for£10 deal meant Sam got all this for £40 \nJust this week, Sam cleaned out her coupon folder and picked up £65-worth of shopping for less than £6, thanks to ‘try me free’ deals, coupons and cashback. Some of the items that she got for free were no use to her family so she put them in the food bank basket. \n“You have to combine your coupons and your cashback, that’s where the real savings are. For example I bought some GoAhead biscuits; they were marked down to £1, then I had a 50p off voucher and the Shopmium app had cashback on them, so I got them for much, much less. \n“Or there was a ‘try me free’ offer on Listerine. If you provide feedback then you get your money back.” Coupons and cashback meant all of this cost about £5 \nAnd it’s not just supermarket shopping. Sam says: “I do it all really. Things like changing our bank account to first direct and we got £150 each. \n\"When I do car insurance and house insurance I use TopCashback – it’s an amalgamation of different money-saving techniques.” Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T16:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T12:08:21.343+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
