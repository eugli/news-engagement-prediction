Salmonella can act as a ‘Trojan horse’ to help the immune system fight the disease. Woman arrested after death of Kim Jong-Un’s half-brother ‘thought she was in comedy show prank’ \nHow? Well, according the scientists, the bacteria can infiltrate tumours and flag the cancer cells up to the body’s immune defences, making them a target for attack. \nThe break through could massively help fight cancer – which at the moment is avoided by the immune system because it is seen as ‘foreign’. \nBut food poisoning, you ask? Luckily, the salmonella strain engineered by the South Korean researchers is a million times less potent than the version of the bug that causes sickness – so have no fear. The break through could massively help fight cancer (Picture: Getty) \nEarly animal tests have proved so successful that the team is now seeking funding for clinical trials. \nIn mice with bowel cancer, more than half the animals were completely cured without any side effects. \nProfessor Joon Haeng Rhee, from Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital in Jeonnam, South Korea, said: ‘We believe that this was turning tumour-helping immune cells, Dr Jekyll, into tumour-killing ones, Mr Hyde.’ \nPrevious studies have looked at using bacteria to carry anti-cancer drugs into tumours. \nHowever, this is the first time scientists have used the body’s own response to salmonella to combat cancer. \nThe discovery arose from an unrelated study when scientists found that bacteria attacking shellfish produced a protein that triggered a strong immune response. \nThe modified salmonella releases the same protein to spur the immune system into action. \nProfessor Kevin Harrington, from The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said: ‘It has been known for some time that certain types of bacteria, including strains of salmonella, are able to grow in tumours but not in normal tissues. \n‘However, until now, attempts to use bacteria as anti-cancer therapies have had limited success, both in the laboratory and in the clinic.’ More ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T16:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T11:58:12.766+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
