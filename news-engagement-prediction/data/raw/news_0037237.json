The event was a collaboration with O’Farrell, SAG-AFTRA, the California Film Commission, Film L.A., Teamsters Local 399, the Film Musicians Secondary Markets Fund and the Producers Guild of America. \nRather than stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling accepting the awards, the event was aimed at honoring the below-the-line professionals who worked on “La La Land” and touting the ongoing efforts to persuade producers to shoot in California. Location manager Robert Foulkes, who suggesting using the Hermosa Beach Pier for Gosling’s signature “City of Stars” scene, accepted the award after dancers Jillian Meyers and Dominic Chaiduang performed to that song.
