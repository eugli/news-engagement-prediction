A spokesman for Abbott tells me: ‘Diane was sworn in, but she’s been advised not to talk about the procedure and exactly what happened.’ The MP, who provoked an outcry when she failed to turn up for one of the votes over the Brexit Bill — claiming to have been suddenly taken ill — will now be allowed to style herself as ‘Right Honourable’. Her new status will permit her, as shadow home Secretary, to be briefed on state secrets. Also sworn in was shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry. The feminist recently complained formally to the House of Commons Speaker after Theresa May referred to her as Lady Nugee (her husband is High Court judge Sir Christopher Nugee). Thornberry was, though, also prepared to accept tradition by going on bended knee before the Queen and swearing the oath of allegiance. There was controversy in 2015 when Buckingham Palace made allowances so that Corbyn, an anti-Monarchist, could join the Privy Council but not have to kneel before the Queen. He was accused of snubbing the Monarch by refusing to be sworn into the Council by going on a short break to Scotland rather than meeting Her Majesty for the ceremony. He finally joined weeks later.
