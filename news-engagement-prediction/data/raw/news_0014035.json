Cory Bernardi Cory Bernardi says his new party 'will give hope to those who despair' at politics \nFormer Liberal senator says he decided to quit the party because the Australian public was being let down View more sharing options Tuesday 7 February 2017 02.54 GMT Last modified on Tuesday 7 February 2017 03.25 GMT \nCory Bernardi says he quit the Liberal party because respect for values has been replaced by political expediency, and because the “political class” is failing the Australian public. \nIn a short speech to the Senate on Tuesday at the opening of the parliament, Bernardi told the chamber he was “reluctant and relieved” to be clarifying his intentions: “reluctant because this decision has weighed heavy on my heart, but relieved because whilst it is difficult, I believe it is the right thing to do.” Cory Bernardi: 'Every Liberal voter knew what they were getting' – politics live Read more \nBernardi said he had issued clear warnings about the need to restore faith in the political system and to “put principle back into politics” – and he regretted that those warnings had been “ignored by those who perhaps needed to hear them most.” \nHe said he intended to build a political movement of Australian conservatives “who will share their unique gifts and talents to chart a better way for our nation”. \nBernardi said it was time “for a conservative way. The enduring beauty of the conservative tradition is it looks to the past, to all that is good and great, to inform the future.” \n“We will give hope to those who despair at the current state of Australian politics and who demand a better way for themselves, for their children and for the nation,” Bernardi told the chamber.

Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAP \nHe said he hoped others would join his new movement. \nBernardi’s official confirmation of his defection from Liberal politics ends months of speculation about the South Australian’s intentions. He was elected only last year for a six-year term as a Liberal senator, which has prompted sharp condemnation from his former colleagues. \nThe leader of the government in the house, Christopher Pyne – a longtime factional opponent of Bernardi’s – on Tuesday declared he should resign and stand for election as an independent. Christopher Pyne (@cpyne) Cory Bernardi was elected as a Liberal. The honourable course is for him to resign his seat and for him to recontest it as an independent. February 6, 2017 \nThe former prime minister Tony Abbott laced his criticism with a dig at Malcolm Turnbull . “Cory Bernardi has made an important contribution to our public life and I deeply regret his decision to leave the Liberal party,” Abbott said on Facebook ahead of Bernardi’s announcement to the Senate. \n“While Cory and I have sometimes disagreed I’m disappointed that more effort has not been made to keep our party united.” Statement on Cory Bernardi. \nFellow South Australian Liberal Simon Birmingham expressed his criticism of Bernardi’s conduct more diplomatically, saying he was sure the voters of South Australia “expected to have four Liberal senators serve out their terms and they will rightly be disappointed”. \nSenior government conservative Peter Dutton said people would be “angry about any defection, angry about the betrayal of the Liberal party values”. \nBernardi had been staying out of the spotlight preparing his departure since the weekend, but informed the prime minister in a phone call early on Tuesday morning that he intended to quit the party. Katharine Murphy (@murpharoo) BREAKING: PM and @corybernardi spoke about 20 minutes ago. Bernardi confirmed he's leaving. Will announce at 12.30pm in the Senate #auspol February 6, 2017 \nThe conversation was cordial, but the prime minister questioned how Bernardi could leave, having just been elected as a Liberal senator. The prime minister told the Coalition party room on Tuesday morning Bernardi had been unable to answer the question. \nHis departure will increase the Senate crossbench to 12, although only 10 micro-party Senators are currently present. One Nation has three Senators, plus the vacancy created by Rod Culleton, the NXT have three, then there is Jacqui Lambie, David Leyonhjelm, Derryn Hinch, Bernardi, and the vacancy created by the departure of the Family First senator Bob Day. \nThe defection means the government will need nine crossbench votes in the Senate to pass legislation if Labor and the Greens oppose it. Bernardi's vote explainer \nBernardi’s speech in the Senate prompted a clash between the two major party leaders in the chamber. \nLabor’s Senate leader, Penny Wong , said the defection confirmed the government was “bitterly divided ... coming apart at the seams, a government so driven with internal division it is more focused on their own issues than on matters that matter most to Australians”. \nWong declared Bernardi’s actions demonstrated the government stood for nothing, and the prime minister had been weakened by a series of concessions. \n“We believe that this government is led by a man who doesn’t believe most of the things that he is now forced to say – and that this is a government that is driven by factionalism, dissent and distrust,” Wong told the chamber. \n“This resignation is a consequence of the failure of leadership by the prime minister, because the prime minister is leading a government that doesn’t have an agenda, that doesn’t have a philosophical framework.” \n“This is a government led by a man who has sold his soul for leadership, a prime minister so weak he’s only allowed to remain in the job for as long as he betrays virtually everything that he ever stood for.” \nThe government Senate leader, George Brandis , said Liberals believed Bernardi had done the wrong thing by standing for re-election as a Liberal in the middle of last year, then turning his back on his party. Cory Bernardi's unchained melody carries a simple note of cynical opportunism | Katharine Murphy Read more \nBrandis said the defection was “perplexing that when there is no difference between the policy and platform on which he sought re-election, and the policy and platform of the government today, he would feel the need to take this course”. \nBrandis also warned Bernardi that he had been elected to support the policies of the government last July, and the government’s expectation was he would go on doing that. \nHe said the government would not be abusive to Bernardi in the same way Labor was abusive to the Queensland Senator Mal Colston when he quit the ALP, but would deal with him professionally and courteously. \n“This is a sad day for the Liberal party,” Brandis said. “It is a sad day when someone leaves the family.” \nGreens leader, Richard Di Natale, said Australians were witnessing a sectarian split in the Liberal party. \nAt a combative press conference after his speech in the Senate, Bernardi said he was hoping to offer “a principled, credible and stable alternative” to voters. He said his long-term aspiration was to strengthen the Coalition by giving it a consistent anchor in the Senate. \nHe said “the revolving door of prime ministers” had brought politics into low esteem, and voters weren’t interested in the “indulgences of the political class”. \nBernardi did not directly answer a question about whether the current prime minister could have done more to keep him in the tent. ‘We can’t keep on like this': Cory Bernardi's existential crisis Read more \nAsked whether he’d tried to recruit fellow Liberals to the breakaway movement, Bernardi said he’d solicited neither support nor advice from his fellow Liberal MPs, and his intention was to “build the conservative movement, and strengthen it.” \nHe said he intended to run Senate candidates in the next election. Bernardi said he had “no idea” whether or not his friend the mining magnate Gina Rinehart would fund his new movement. \nBernardi said if the government put forward good policy, he would support that policy it in the Senate; and he would also guarantee supply.
