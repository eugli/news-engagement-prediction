Lady Gaga's Super Bowl trickery UP NEXT VIDEO Lady Gaga's Super Bowl trickery. Source: Twitter Lady Gaga's Super Bowl trickery \nFans looked on in awe as the kooky singer, surrounded by glittering drones in the colours of the American flag, blasted out a line from the Pledge of Allegiance before plunging a whopping 79 metres down to pitch level. \nBut it turns out the impressive feat was actually a trick of the eye. Gaga started her performance on the roof before flying down to her stage. Source: Getty But it turns out the leap was more of an illusion. Source: Getty \nWhy? Because Gaga actually filmed the breath-taking plunge back on January 30, when it's likely her fall from the roof was broken by a net just out of sight. \nProducers then simply merged that footage with the live recording of her being lowered into the stadium to kick start her epic performance. \nThe game was up when people who were actually there took to social media to confirm that from their perspective, the show began with Gaga suspended in the air, as opposed to with the roof jump. Footage from inside the stadium shows Gaga dangling mid-air. Source: Twitter \nAnd Intel Drones general manager Natalie Cheung has revealed that from a \"logistics and creative perspective\", filming the eight-second fall and then expecting Gaga to launch into a 13 minutes performance just wasn't realistic. \n\"It‚Äôs a bit hard for her to go from the roof all the way down to the floor of the stadium,\" she told USA Today , adding that the weather also played a part. \n‚ÄúIn February, you don‚Äôt know what it will be like during Super Bowl day. We‚Äôd hate to plan all this and, if the wind speeds are too high or if it‚Äôs raining and the roof is closed, no one can see this spectacular show,‚Äù she said. Gaga took it down a notch to sing her balled \"Million Reasons\". Source: Getty \nBut despite the trickery, the world nonetheless went gaga for Gaga's killer half-time performance at the 2017 Super Bowl. \nTaking to social media, fans were quick to praise the 30-year-old American singer, with one tweeting: \"Lady Gaga is slaying\". \nNot holding back, another wrote: \"IM LITERALLY SWEATING I LOVE GAGA SO MUCH (sic)\". ‚Äî Hanna Hinch (@HannaHinch_x) February 6, 2017 IM LITERALLY SWEATING I LOVE GAGA SO MUCH ‚Äî olivia üí´üíñü¶Ñ (@bacardimustache) February 6, 2017 Paws up!
