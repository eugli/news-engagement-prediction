The car was introduced at an event in FX Sudirman Mall, Senayan last week, officiated by Proton CEO Datuk Ahmad Fuaad Kenali and Indonesia Otomotif Institute secretary-general Yanuarto Widihandono. Also present was Datuk Madani Sahari, Malaysia Automotive Institute CEO. \nIndonesia is the car’s second export market after Brunei . According to Ahmad Fuaad, the country is an important market for the brand. “Not only have we maintained strong G2G relations being ASEAN founding members, but we also share many similarities in terms of people, language, culture as well as the weather. It’s almost an extension of each other,” he said. \nTwo variants of the Iriz are available in the republic, a 1.3L MT Standard and a 1.3L CVT Standard, priced at IDR175.25 million (RM58,500) and IDR185.28 million (RM61,850) respectively. The base version of the Iriz is powered by a 1.3 litre VVT engine that produces 94 hp at 5,750 rpm and 120 Nm of torque at 4,000 rpm, paired with either a five-speed manual gearbox or a CVT. \nIndonesian-spec cars are pretty much identical to those sold here, equipped with projector headlights, 14-inch wheels, LED tail lights and black door handles and mirror caps. Inside, there are fabric seats and a two-DIN head unit with Bluetooth connectivity. Safety-wise, there are dual airbags, ABS with EBD and brake assist and stability control. \nSeven colours are available for the car in Indonesia – Cotton White, Midnight Black, Sterling Silver, Atlantic Blue, Graphite Grey, Citrus Green and Fire Red. \nThe car will be available at all PT Proton Edar Indonesia (PEI) outlets in the country. The Proton subsidiary operates a total of 25 sales and after sales outlets in Indonesia, spread out over strategic locations across Java, Kalimantan, Sumatera and Sulawesi, with eight of them centred around Jabodetabek region.
