More than 40 per cent of the large Crown offices – branches run directly by the Post Office – will soon die a death.\nEarly this year, the Post Office admitted 37 Crown branches are to be closed or sold off and put inside shops.\nThis is on top of a further 93 it revealed last year would close or be franchised inside stores.\nSo far only 40 of these earlier earmarked branches have found a home – in a WH Smith store. The future of the rest remains unclear.\nLast post: Locals say the South Woodford closure will be a disaster, while Abby Miller (pictured) is upset the branch is going because she regularly uses it to collect parcels\nThis latest wave of closures has been well hidden under the double-speak of 'network transformation engagement' – a term you might expect from the Ministry of Truth in George Orwell's novel 1984 rather than from the friendly Post Office.\nBut those who run the network have a long history of using weasel words to hoodwink customers.\nTerms such as 'network reinvention', 'transformation', 'investment' and 'change' have all been used to mask the closure of almost 7,000 sub-post offices since 2000.\nThe mood on the high street confirms that many long-suffering customers are not impressed.\nHURTING LOCAL BUSINESSES\nWartime leader Winston Churchill was the MP for the East London suburb of South Woodford for 40 years.\nUnder his command, the British bulldog spirit remained unbowed during the Blitz strikes of the Second World War, when bombing raids destroyed shops and houses a few doors down from the local Crown post office.\nBut Post Office bosses are now doing what the Nazis failed to achieve, which is get rid of the Crown branch.\nKnowing the area well – having spent ten years living around the corner from this always busy branch – I am all too aware of the damage it will do.\nThere is no local WH Smith shop that can accommodate a post office branch. The next nearest Crown branch is in Walthamstow, which can take half an hour to get to on congested roads. But this branch is also earmarked for closure.\nLocals are fearful of what it means for South Woodford high street. Estate agent Abby Miller is upset the branch is being axed. It is right next door to her office.\nShe says: 'Post Office bosses say it has to move with the times, but they fail to recognise the growing need for its services by people like me who do a lot of internet shopping and use the branch for posting and picking up parcels.'\nSpirit: Churchill was MP for South Woodford\nAbby adds: 'It is a disaster for the community. I cannot believe the branch does not make money as it is always busy with queues snaking out the door.\n'This area has always had a post office and to lose the friendly face-to-face service will be devastating.'\nLocal Anita Brookes is also unhappy that the Post Office is pulling out.\nThe retired driver says: 'It is being bloody-minded in closing such a well-used branch and it makes no economic sense.\n'It is a decision made by bean counters that have no idea about what is actually going on.\n'The local Co-op bank closed recently and I relied on the post office for my banking.\n'What is the point of the post office boasting how it offers such wonderful services if it then closes down the most popular large branches? It is really upsetting.'\nNot everyone believes the Crown branch's demise is a bad thing.\nSecondary school teacher Suzie Rees says: 'People are being too nostalgic. There are far too many struggling shops on the high street. It makes sense to put post offices inside retailers. The Post Office is not a charity.'\nTAKING THE HEART OUT OF A COMMUNITY\nThe bustling market town of Bishop's Stortford in Hertfordshire has been my home for the past six years.\nIt has a sense of community that is great for bringing up a young family. At the town's heart is a Crown post office. But not for much longer.\nDespite thousands of pounds recently spent on a major revamp, including the introduction of a 'digital application service' till with a high-tech Big Brother-style camera and scanner for driving licence applications, staff were told last month it is being closed. Instead, a branch is likely to be installed in the local WH Smith store.\nLocal physiotherapist Marta Smorowinska is unimpressed. She regularly visits the branch to post parcels.\nShe says: 'This branch is so conveniently situated. I love coming here at quiet times of the day to get served quickly. If they end up shoving the branch into the back of a shop, I am not sure I am going to use it.'\nMarta is not alone in voicing her dismay that the branch is shutting. Barber Jolene Dipple believes the knock-on effect of shutting the branch will be to reduce the number of people who pass by her salon, Bow Jangles, just a few doors down.\nShe says: 'We get a lot of customers who pop in after a trip to the post office. They will go elsewhere if forced to use another post office.'\nShe adds: 'There is something special about having a standalone post office at the heart of Bishop's Stortford. Rip it out and everyone suffers, from locals through to businesses and the quality of post office services offered.'\nNot everyone is against the closure. Retired banker John Emmett says: 'It might not make me popular, but I think putting the post office inside a shop makes business sense. Post offices should not be run as social services.'\nHOW 330 COMMUNITIES IN THE UK ARE SERVED BY VANS ENTER THE MOBILE OPTION\nThe mobile branch is being hailed by the Post Office as a possible saviour for communities shorn of their local branch.\nFourteen new post offices on wheels were added to a fleet of 42 last year – and more are expected to hit the road in the near future.\nService: The mobile branches are set up to work like small post offices\nThe Mercedes-Benz Sprinter vans currently serve more than 330 rural and urban communities. They have been adapted to offer the same level of service you might expect from a small post office.\nOn board is a sub-postmaster to handle everything from posting parcels to basic banking, such as making cash withdrawals and deposits.\nABANDONING VULNERABLE PEOPLE\nChelmsford in Essex is a brand new city. It was promoted to this heady status just five years ago as part of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations.\nIt has also enjoyed a multi-million pound revamp of its shopping centre. But the city does not justify a Crown post office. Instead, a branch is run out of the back of the local WH Smith store.\nThe store's frontage is impressive. A two-storey glass-fronted edifice is sharp and modern.\nThere is a large WH Smith sign flanked either side by bold post offices logos. Yet step inside and you struggle to find the branch. It has been tucked away upstairs behind a coffee shop and maze of bookshelves.\nOnce there, customers face an anaemic open area where the focus seems more on getting customers to serve themselves rather than be dealt with by a real person.\nThere are three self-serve machines – two of which are not working when I visit – and a dozen people queuing patiently to be served by the one till out of three that is open. Another member of staff sits rather forlornly at a separate 'travel money' kiosk.\nAnna Morrow, from nearby Little Waltham, is a 'puppy parent'. She is currently training 20-month-old labrador Quiz to become an assistant dog for people with disabilities.\nThe retired nurse is a volunteer for charity Canine Partners. Among those who benefit from the trained dogs are former soldiers who have been injured in combat in Afghanistan and Iraq and now need assistance.\nAnna says: 'One of my duties is to understand how difficult day-to-day shopping can be for disabled people. For example, if you have a guide dog the animals are not supposed to be taken on escalators.\n'But the lift to the post office has broken down today – it is not the first time it has happened. This means many people with mobility problems cannot use the branch.'\nHelen Wooldridge, from Great Baddow, is annoyed the post office was allowed to be installed on the second floor.\nThe mother-of-four suffers from epilepsy and was being assisted by carer Cassandra Upchurch. She was using the post office to renew her passport so she can visit a son in Spain.\nHelen says: 'How on earth was permission granted for a post office to be stuck at the back of a shop up a long flight of stairs?\n'Lots of young mums with pushchairs and elderly people who have mobility problems rely on this post office. But it is unwelcoming and not user friendly at all.'\nTHE POST OFFICE VISION\nThe Government has ploughed £2 billion of taxpayers' money into the post office network in recent years.\nThe money was handed over on the understanding that the Post Office kept open 11,500 outlets so that 99 per cent of the population lived within three miles of a branch.\nBut the latest wave of closures leaves the network perilously close to breaking this solemn pledge.\nPost Office boss Paula Vennells remains defiantly bullish, boasting that 2,000 new branches could be opened.\nDIARY OF DESTRUCTION SINCE TURN OF THE MILLENNIUM 2000: As champagne corks pop to celebrate a new Millennium, there are about 18,400 Post Office branches. This compares with a network peak of 25,000 in 1965.\nStamp of authority: Some two out of every five surviving 315 branches are to be shut\n2003: A cull of 3,000 post offices in towns and cities is unveiled as an 'urban reinvention programme'. Benefits books are also scrapped, making it harder for post offices to survive. This benefits book service generated 40 per cent of all post office revenue.\n2006: Post offices lose the right to sell TV licences. Stamps can also be purchased online.\n2007: The Post Office unveils a 'network change programme'. Some 2,500 branches are closed after a six-week 'consultation'. Eighty-five Crown branches are also given the axe.\n2012: The Government pledges a £1.34 billion cash injection into the ailing post office network to keep it alive until at least 2015: A further £640 million is committed, taking Government funding up until 2018.\n2017: The Post Office wields the axe (again) on Crown offices. Some two out of every five surviving 315 branches are to be shut, with at least half then relocated inside a shop.\nMelanie Corfield, a spokeswoman for the Post Office, says: 'We are certainly not looking to close any more branches down.\n'For example, we are confident the 37 Crown post offices that are currently being looked at can be relocated – as others have been – in a process taking 18 months.'\nShe adds: 'Without such forward planning more branches are in danger. We need to adapt for the challenges of the 21st Century.'\nThe Post Office says that in order to attract more customers it will focus more on banking, offering basic cash withdrawal and deposit services for 99 per cent of high street bank customers.\nIt already offers own-brand current accounts, savings accounts, personal loans, credit cards and mortgages provided by the Bank of Ireland UK.\nIn addition it sells travel insurance, home insurance, foreign currency and phone line rentals.\nThe Communication Workers Union is unimpressed by the wave of Crown post office closures.\nA spokesman says: 'This is two fingers up to the community. Post Offices are being run into the ground. Offloading responsibility by ramming Crown post offices into the back of a shop is not a well thought out survival strategy. It is a shambles.'\nHe adds: 'This is a slash-and-burn paper exercise with the end aim of selling off what remains of the Post Office, just like was done with the Royal Mail just over three years ago.'\nVennells hopes further cost-cutting to the 357-year-old Post Office could see it make a profit of £100 million a year within a decade. For the 12 months to the end of March 2016 it lost £24 million.\nDeals Of The Week £125 cash & 3% interest on £1,500 Classic Plus 25-month interest-free spending M&S points Spend £10, get £15 bonus in ANY store New members only 3% cashback on household bills Reward Account Demand a cheaper price - join our collective switch Energy bills", "external_links": ["http://www.moneysupermarket.com/current-accounts/details/?productCode=CUR_tsb_Classic_Plus_tier1&index=2&count=2&selectedProductId=CUR_tsb_Classic_Plus_tier1&gid=CUR_INTEREST&page=&source=THISMO1", "http://www.moneysupermarket.com/current-accounts/details/?productCode=CUR_natwest_Reward_Tier01_0_0&index=10&count=20&selectedProductId=CUR_natwest_Reward_Tier01_0_0&gid=CUR_OVERDRAFT&page=&source=THISMO1", "http://www.moneysupermarket.com/credit-cards/details/?productCode=CC_MS_CARD&index=55&count=105&selectedProductId=CC_MS_CARD&gid=CC_ALLCARDS&page=&source=THISMO1", "http://www.quidco.com/ref?cid=4831&utm_source=ThisisMoney&utm_campaign=ThisisMoney_AffiliateArticle&utm_medium=AffiliateArticle"], "published": "2017-02-04T23:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T19:24:57.084+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
