IndiaToday.in | Written by Devarsi Ghosh A + A - \nThat Karan Johar and Kajol are no longer friends is not news anymore. Karan Johar has directed Kajol in three of her biggest hits till now; Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... and My Name Is Khan. The fallout between the two sent shockwaves through the industry. \nKaran Johar has always been very clear that he does not wish to mend his relation with Kajol. In his book An Unsuitable Boy, Karan Johar wrote, \"I don't have a relationship with Kajol any more. We have had a fallout. Something happened that disturbed me deeply which I will not talk about because it is something that I like to protect and I feel it would not be fair to her or to me. After two-and-a-half decades, Kajol and I don't talk at all.\" \nKaran added that his rift with Kajol was more of a bad blood with Kajol's husband Ajay Devgn . \nHowever, Kajol has always been quiet about the entire issue. Recently, speaking to Indianexpress.com , Kajol spoke her mind on Karan Johar, \"I think relationships are generally difficult, nothing to do with Bollywood.\" \nOn being asked specifically about Karan Johar, Kajol said, \"I wouldn't like to comment anything on what happened with Karan (Johar).\" \nWATCH: Can't look beyond Ajay, says Kajol To get the latest entertainment news and gossip, follow us on Twitter @Showbiz_IT and Like us on facebook.com/IndiaToday For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in . ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.
