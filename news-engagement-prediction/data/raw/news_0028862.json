Most people have already voted by post. \nThe Swiss government and a majority MPs and political parties support the proposal, which would allow the grandchildren of immigrants to skip several steps in the lengthy process of securing a Swiss passport. \nBut the outcome of the referendum has been clouded by the far-right nationalist Swiss People’s party (SVP), which put Islam and national identity at the centre of the debate. \nAccording to a migration department study, fewer than 25,000 people in the country of about eight million qualify as third-generation immigrants, meaning they have at least one grandparent who was born in Switzerland or acquired residency. \nNearly 60% of these are Italian, followed by those from the Balkans or Turkey. \nInitial debate on the proposal had nothing to do with religion, said Sophie Guignard of the Institute of Political Science at the University of Bern. But then the SVP, a party repeatedly accused of demonising Islam, that focused on the risks of more Muslims becoming citizens and the possible “loss of Swiss values”, Guignard said. \nCentral to that effort was a widely distributed poster showing a woman staring out from a black niqab with a tagline urging voters to reject “uncontrolled citizenship”. The SVP was not officially responsible for the poster, which was commissioned by the Committee Against Facilitated Citizenship. Though this group has several SVP members in leadership positions. \nJean-Luc Addor, co-chair of the committee and SVP lawmaker, urged people to reject the proposal because soon most third-generation immigrants will not be of European origin. \n“In one or two generations, who will these third-generation foreigners be?” he wrote in an opinion piece on the SVP website. “They will be born of the Arab Spring, they will be from sub-Saharan Africa, the Horn of Africa, Syria or Afghanistan,” said Addor, who has defended the niqab poster. \nGuignard said mainstream politicians and journalists viewed the poster as “a violent attack against Muslims”. \nThe SVP in 2009 successfully persuaded Swiss voters to approve a ban on new mosque minaret construction, while religiously charged messages have been a part of multiple referendums on immigration since. \nLatest polls show that between 55-66% of people support easier citizenship for third-generation immigrants, with 31-44% against. \nThe no side has, however, gained about 10 percentage points since polling opened, with analysts saying an upset cannot be ruled out.
