DHS Secretary John Kelly has said that he's considering the idea of asking visitors for the login data for their various social media accounts , information that typically would require a warrant to obtain. \"Circumventing the normal protection for such private information is simply unacceptable,\" Wyden said in the letter, sent Monday. \"There are well-established procedures governing how law enforcement agencies may obtain data from social media companies and email providers. The process typically requires that the government obtain a search warrant or other court order, and then ask the service provider to turn over the user's data.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:47:33.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
