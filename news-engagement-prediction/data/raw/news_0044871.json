My ears ached. My fingers were stiff from the cold despite my gloves. My toes tingled from the snow seeping into my boots. The wind whipping through the streets had scattered the stack of newspapers I laid down briefly to tie my shoe. I was ready to go home, but I still had 26 papers left to deliver before 4 a.m. \nI was home from college for winter break, helping my dad with his newspaper route. Delivering papers from 1 a.m. to 4 a.m. is one of three jobs my dad works to ensure that I get a great education. \nIn high school, I knew what it would take for me to achieve what I wanted to achieve in society. My number one goal was getting into a top school. Zach Wood (James Miotto) \nWhen I was accepted to Williams College, it offered me considerable financial aid. But despite making significant sacrifices, my family still could not afford to pay the remaining tuition. \nSo I’ve pursued many different ways to help fund my education. \nI’ve taken out student loans. I’ve reached out to philanthropists. I’ve crowdsourced funding and raised money with the help of local news stations. I’ve tutored. I’ve done work-study jobs, odd jobs for neighbors, research for professors, paid internships, and taught fourth-grade science twice a week at an elementary school near Williams. \nBut still, my financial situation is a frequent source of stress. I worry about my credit card getting declined. I worry about the cost of public transportation to Columbia University, where I’m studying for my junior year. \nDespite many colleges having generous endowments, there are so many students like me. Too many to count. [ New York takes a stab at debt-free college, covering tuition for families earning less than $125,000 ] \nOften, as in my case, the key issue is not that colleges do not offer generous aid packages. Rather, the issue is that too often the “demonstrated need” defined by the experts does not meet the actual need of many college students. \nSo students take out huge loans, accruing debt. And they can end up prioritizing work over school, the need for money too pressing to allow them to get the most out of their education. [ Minorities and poor college students are shouldering the most debt ] \nThis winter, I was more preoccupied with finding a way to pay my family contribution for spring semester than I was with my final exams. \nAfter my dad and I finished his paper route on that bitterly cold morning, we were exhausted. It was 3:30 a.m., my hat was soaking wet from the snow, and I was miserable. But I didn’t say a word. I knew that my dad did this every day and never complained. local", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:51:12.931+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
