(“I will pray that Mike Pence will have a great impression on Donald Trump and make him more conservative,” Mr. Woolery said in one appearance.) “Blunt Force Truth,” which Mr. Woolery hosts with a like-minded friend, Mark Young, has been around since late 2014, at times rising to the Top 10 on the podcast charts .

Had Mr. Trump not won the election, Hollywood could have continued to ignore Mr. Woolery and Mr. Young, 59, as two more pontificating cranks: Ho-hum, and back to NPR. It seems foolhardy to treat them that way now. Perhaps if the entertainment industry had paid attention earlier to the Chuck Woolerys in its midst, it might not have been blindsided by the election outcome, which seemed on the Left Coast to simply be a formality preceding the installation of Hillary Clinton. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Hollywood has the awesome power to speak without being interrupted. Maybe people here do need to spend more time listening. “We’re not the biggest voice in politics, but we’re still an important voice,” Mr. Young said during a joint phone interview with Mr. Woolery. (Mr. Young lives in Michigan, where he runs the Detroit advertising agency Jekyll and Hyde , and he serves as president of World Outreach, a nonprofit Christian organization. Mr. Woolery decamped for Texas a few years ago after more than four decades in Los Angeles.) Piping up from his line, Mr. Woolery, a gun rights activist who describes himself as a conservative libertarian and constitutionalist, gave his take on Mr. Trump. “I was not a Trump backer in the beginning,” he said, “but I eventually got on board for fear of losing the Constitution altogether, for fear of going down this hypersocialist road. I thought, ‘How bad can Trump possibly be?’ Sure, it was a big bet on the unknown. But nobody can change Washington from the inside. They’re all phonies. We believe that both the Republicans and Democrats have sold Americans out.” Full disclosure: My time with Mr. Woolery and Mr. Young did not exactly result in a love connection. (Ba-dum-bum.) In response to an emailed interview request, Mr. Young responded that he would have to think about it. “As you can imagine, the N.Y.T. is not on our list of favorite publications,” he said.
