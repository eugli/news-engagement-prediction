And, as it turns out, he absolutely delivered. \nRDJ went live from the set of Avengers: Infinity War , where he answered a handful of questions about the film, which he says is going to be \"so epic.\" \nHere's the list of what got revealed - Click Any Link for more info on that story! Infinity War 1 & 2 Connection Confirmed \n\"I can't give too much away, but this literally feels like the second greatest story ever told. And there's so many characters, so much interesting story, so many surprises.\" \nHe also hinted at the scope of the film, and just how much the Marvel Cinematic Universe has grown since he first suited up as Tony Stark in the original Iron Man . \n\"I think what's changed is the universe around him, honestly, if you think about it. I mean, there's so many offshoots now. Peter Parker's in the mix, Guardians are on fire.\" \nAnd of course, RDJ brought a few surprise guests in his video. First were Joe and Anthony Russo, who are directing the film. They took time to answer a question or two, even debating which Avengers they'd take on a family vacation, before walking away to set. \nAnd second was one of the biggest pieces of news - the reveal that Tom Holland , who plays the MCU's Spider-Man , is in fact appearing in the movie. Holland was revealed to be RDJ's cameraman for the video, and showed a brief glimpse of himself with motion capture dots on his face. \nAnd the third cameo, albeit a quick one, was of Chris Pratt , suited up to reprise his Guardians of the Galaxy role as Peter Quill/Star Lord in the film. Pratt, somewhat jokingly, appeared ready to answer Facebook live questions, before Downey motioned to Holland to end the video. \nWhile these teases only give us a piece of what to expect on the set of Infinity War , they still were a delight nonetheless. \nAvengers: Infinity War is described by Marvel Studios as the culmination of everything in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since Iron Man in 2008. The movie is filming now under directors Anthony and Joe Russo, from a screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. The expansive confirmed cast includes Robert Downey, Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, Scarlett Johansson, Tom Holland, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bethany, Sebastian Stan, Benedict Cumberbatch, Benedict Wong, Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Karen Gillan, Vin Diesel, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper, Pom Klementieff, and Josh Brolin as the villain Thanos. Avengers: Infinity War and its as-yet-untitled sequel are filming back-to-back for a May 4, 2018 and May 3, 2019 release, respectively. \nHave you seen LEGO Batman yet?
