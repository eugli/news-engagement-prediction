Brendan Rodgers and Jurgen Klopp have almost identical records in their first 54 @premierleague games in charge of @LFC . #SSNHQ pic.twitter.com/6WHyAKmwmH \n— Sky Sports News HQ (@SkySportsNewsHQ) February 7, 2017 \nWhile Rodgers was appointed Liverpool boss directly after the end of the 2011/2012 campaign, Klopp was rushed in to clean up the mess left behind by Rodgers last October. \nRodgers had a complete summer to implement his ideas with the squad on the training field but Klopp had to repair the depleted confidence levels within his ranks before he could introduce his philosophy. \nKlopp shunned the chance to sign players in the January transfer window, instead preferring to wait until the summer. The German spent big on the likes of Sadio Mane and Georginio Wignaldum but ended the window having made a £15m profit. Rodgers is repairing his reputation at Celtic Park (Picture: Getty) \nThe Reds finished in seventh place after Klopp’s first season at the club but they reached the EFL Cup and Europa League finals. Some going for a club that had unravalled during Rodgers’ final months on Merseyside. \nLiverpool lost both finals but the journeys in each competition convinced the squad that Klopp’s methods were worth buying into and the Reds hit the ground running this term with a brand of fast, exciting football. \nDuring that time, Klopp’s corrected many of the mistakes made by Rodgers during his calamitous final transfer window at the club. The former Dortmund boss has got rid of the likes of Christian Benteke and Mario Balotelli to bring in younger, hungrier players like Marko Grujic and Loris Karius. Liverpool fixtures \nLeicester (A) – Mon 27 Feb Arsenal (H) – Sat 4 Mar Burnley (H) – Sun 12 Mar Man City (A) – Sun 19 Mar Everton (H) – Sat 1 Apr Bournemouth (H) – Wed 5 Apr \nKlopp’s side looked to be Chelsea’s biggest challengers after a 1-0 win against Manchester City on New Year’s Eve but just one in ten matches in all competitions has derailed their season. \nThe German’s experiencing pressure like never before at Anfield but Liverpool’s boom and bust nature cannot claim another victim. Klopp remains Liverpool’s greatest asset. \nUnlike during Rodgers’ reign, the manger is the most important person at the club. Klopp has more authority over the board, greater control over transfers and his team doesn’t rely on an individual in the way that Rodgers’ did on Luis Suarez. Liverpool have a clear path and identity again (Picture: Getty) \nDietmar Hamann criticised his former club this week for handing Klopp a six-year deal last year on the basis that he’s achieved little to warrant such backing. \nThere’s certainly a sense that the German has received backing that Rodgers wasn’t afforded but Klopp’s record speaks for itself. \nLiverpool’s form has dipped. Klopp, too, seems agitated in a way we’ve not seen before since he arrived on Merseyside. \nBut make no mistake, Liverpool’s most valuable asset is now their manager. He should be given as much time as it takes to get it right. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T17:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:41:10.140+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
