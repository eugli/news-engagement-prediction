Image copyright PA Image caption The Republic of Ireland voted overwhelmingly to legalise same-sex marriage in 2015 \nSpeaking immediately after the presentation, the 61-year-old said Ireland's referendum on same-sex marriage had also been a factor. \n\"It was just after that that I started writing the book,\" he told reporters, saying that he and Toby had \"had a secret mission\" to reflect the referendum result in its narrative. \n\"If I had written this 20 or 30 years ago it may not have had that element,\" the author went on. \n\"You should be teaching your child something; it's not supposed to be the other way around. But maybe it always is in truth.\" \nImmediately after his win, Barry got in contact with Toby, to whom the book is dedicated, via Skype. \n\"I couldn't hear what he was saying, he couldn't hear me, but his face was so radiant with happiness,\" he told BBC Breakfast on Wednesday. \nBarry, who receives Â£30,000, also won the prize in 2008 with The Secret Scripture. \nIn 2015 the author wrote a widely circulated letter to the Irish Times in which he described himself as \"the more than proud father of one shining person who happens to be a member of the LGBT community.\" \nFollow us on Facebook , on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts , or on Instagram at bbcnewsents .
