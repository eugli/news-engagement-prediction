Democrats had sought to delay the vote until Pruitt’s emails were released.\nThe more than 7,000 emails show Pruitt and his staff coordinating strategy with conservative groups funded by oil and gas companies and executives, including billionaire brothers David and Charles Koch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:38:37.865+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
