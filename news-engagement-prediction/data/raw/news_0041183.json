Another accused also escaped minutes before the police reached their hideout. \nHowever, a friend who came to meet Sunil was taken into custody, the sources said. \nThe actress, who was kidnapped by a gang of six on Friday (February 17) night, alleged that Sunil committed the crime at the behest of others. \nSunil reportedly told her that he had been hired to kidnap her and if she resisted, he would have to use force. \nThe actress was let off near a director-turned-actor's house, from where the police were informed and her driver Martin was arrested. \nNow, the police have arrested three of the seven persons allegedly involved in the crime. They will be charged under under Sections 366 (kidnapping), 376 (rape) of IPC and Section 66 of the IT Act. \nOn Sunday night, the Malayalam film fraternity gathered here to express their support to the victim. After the horrific incident, several celebrities across the industries have showed their support to the actor.
