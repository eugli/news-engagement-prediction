Hollands Image 20 of 20 Closet case: the ex-bride wore green 1 / 20 Back to Gallery \nWell, this is awkward. \nIn December 2015, over the New Year's holiday in Palm Springs, Calif., I got engaged. But by August the following year, we had called the wedding off. \nFor a dress-obsessed bride like me, saying goodbye to my prospective gowns -- an ethereal Marchesa creation that wooed me from Joan Pillow's store window, a vintage Ines Di Santo find, and a custom dancing frock by local designer Becky P. Hollands -- was surprisingly poignant. \nLast spring, over truffle fries and Veuve Clicquot at Brasserie 19, Hollands and I dreamed up a one-of-a-kind reception look for the New Zealand nuptials that never happened. Two months ago, we returned to the scene of the crime – more pommes frites, please; hold the champagne – where she proposed that we create something special for Super Bowl LI instead. \nI mean, the Super Bowl can't get cancelled – can it? \nIn my mind, there was only one soiree worthy of bespoke work: the Houston Host Committee's \"Luminaries of the Game\" gala co-hosted by couture queen Lynn Wyatt and James A. Baker III. \nWith six weeks to plan, drape (designer speak for fit), and produce my made-to-measure look, I immediately began researching silhouettes, colors, fabric and aesthetics via the modern girls' encyclopedia, a.k.a. Pinterest. \nAs you may have suspected, I can be a little (OK, extremely) picky about what I wear. No black, no bling, no cap sleeves, no three-quarter sleeves, no sleeveless, no high neck, no mini-skirts, no slits, no sweetheart necklines and absolutely nothing even remotely \"traditional.\" \nI've been known to reference magazines, Instagram, YouTube, screenshots and old faithful (Pinterest) during the week leading up to a big event for hair/beauty/accessory inspiration. #NoShame \nHollands wasn't fazed by my perfectionist tendencies. That's fortunate because I also have the attention span of a 12-year-old. Imagine me, semi-nude and attempting to stand absolutely still, downing truffle popcorn (I have an addiction, sir) and Prosecco in my living room. Truthfully, I giggled at \"Mad Men\" and \"Real Housewives\" re-runs during most of the respective two-hour and 30-minute fittings. Bless her heart. \nWe settled on AstroTurf-meets-Pantone green with just a hint of side boob. Note: There was ample Gwyneth Paltrow googling to nail the latter. \nDay of, I cited photos of Sara Foster's expertly undone waves during my River Oaks Drybar appointment; the VH1 \"Barely Famous\" starlet is my current hair muse. Canary yellow diamonds from Tenenbaum, a rainbow hued miniaudiere and my favorite silver stilettos (which reminds me, I desperately need a new pair) completed the ensemble. \nIn the end, Lynn and her son, Steve Wyatt, gave my re-purposed wedding look rave reviews. And that's all that matters, right? Under-cleavage probably wouldn't have gone over well with future-in-laws anyway.
