Locals have also been known to steal infants from their mothers to sell them on as pets. Once the HOC had located them, the crew set up camp for the night near the orangutans' nest and waited for the full rescue team to arrive. The adorable baby orangutan rests its head on its mother's chest with its dark eyes open The mother is treated by the vet, who lays a reassuring hand on her side, as the baby clings on A vet checks the mother over using a stethoscope while the baby lies acrossher side Two vets tuck the pair up in a rescue net in an attempt to save them from any potential danger A crowd gathers around to oversee the rescue operation of the mother and baby apes The following morning, in spite of driving rain, IAR's marksman Argitoe successfully released the mother and baby back into the wild. They are now said to be able to look forward to a bright future after rescuers saved moved them to a safe new home in the rainforest. A statement on the charity's website said the animals and humans generally avoid each other, but due to deforestation their encounters are more frequent and can end in tragic circumstances. The rescue workers managed to battle the driving rain to release the mother and baby Still clinging onto its mother, the baby orangutan's rescue is complete as they scamper away The mother ape climbs back up a tree as she adapts to her new surroundings in the rainforest Rescue workers from International Animal Rescue wheel a custom cage through the rainforest A group of workers gather around the cage as they prepare to release the apes into the wild The cage door is lifter and the orangutans are freed into a safer part of the rainforest in Borneo The statement reads: 'Orangutans and humans naturally avoid each other as much as possible. 'However, the rapid rate of deforestation is pushing orangutans closer to human habitation every day as they search for food - this has caused an increase in the number of calls our team receives every day and sometimes has tragic consequences. 'Orangutans are big, powerful animals and sadly, largely out of ignorance and fear, people use brute force to subdue them. 'International Animal Rescue is committed to implementing an extensive education programme to teach people not to fear these endangered primates but to respect their strength and their struggle to survive.'
