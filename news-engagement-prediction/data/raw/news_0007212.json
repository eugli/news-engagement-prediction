But we are trying really hard and we love each other a lot.”\nAdded Bushnell: “There are so many weird elements to being in a relationship after The Bachelor … We’ve gotten in arguments like any other couple, but about some things that other couples wouldn’t have to fight about, like the fact that we met when he was dating other women. You can say that’s what I signed up for, but it’s still real life and it’s still hard.”\nBut in November, the Ben & Lauren: Happily Ever After? stars, who recently revealed on their show that their wedding is off, are focused on moving forward.\n“We’re still engaged and we’re still together,” Higgins explained. “We are building a foundation and we’re taking every day one step at a time. That’s what I’m excited about. ”\n“This trip brought us closer together,” added Bushnell about the couple’s trip to Honduras . “We weren’t ready to jump into a wedding. And we both needed to take a step back from life in the limelight. Me understanding a little bit more of where Ben’s heart is was so important and exactly what we needed.”\nAnd for the record, “I still want to marry Lauren, very much so,” said Higgins. “Our relationship is better now than it has ever been.”\nShow Full Article", "external_links": ["https://www.instagram.com/p/BP9EE2qgyKM/?taken-by=laurenbushnell&hl=en", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BP-zVoJFU4B/"], "published": "2017-02-02T05:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T05:58:21.279+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
