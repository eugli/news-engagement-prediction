Media caption Lady Evans said peers should not 're-run' EU referendum Media caption Baroness Smith of Basildon: \"None of us know what Brexit will look like\" \nThe government has set aside five days in total to discuss the various stages of the EU (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill - starting with its Second Reading, in which peers debate the general principles of the bill. \nThe Second Reading debate is due to conclude on Tuesday evening - possibly with a vote, but only if peers break with their usual practice of allowing government legislation through unopposed at this stage. \nAlthough amendments are not voted on at this stage, speeches are being closely watched for signs of the mood of peers on the two key ones of parliament having a \"final meaningful vote\" on the draft Brexit agreement - and guaranteeing the rights of EU citizens in the UK. \nDetailed scrutiny of the bill at committee stage is due to take place on 27 February and 1 March. If the bill is not amended, then it could theoretically be approved by the Lords at Third Reading on 7 March, becoming law shortly afterwards. \nIf peers do make changes to the bill, it would put them on a collision course with MPs - who overwhelmingly passed the bill unaltered and would be expected to overturn any Lords amendments. \nAlthough the Conservatives have the largest number of peers in the Lords, with 252 members, they are vulnerable to being outvoted if opposition peers - including 202 Labour peers and 102 Lib Dems - join forces. Much will hinge of the actions of the 178 crossbenchers - who are not aligned to any party.
