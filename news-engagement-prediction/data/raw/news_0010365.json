He is expected to return to the country within weeks. \nA former Prime Minister, Hekmatyar was a prominent anti-Soviet commander in the 1980s. \nFollowing the 2001 US-led invasion of Afghanistan and fall of the Taliban, the US State Department designated him a terrorist, accusing him of taking part in and supporting attacks by al-Qaeda and the Taliban.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T12:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T07:39:29.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
