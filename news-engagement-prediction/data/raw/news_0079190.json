The out-groups it portrays are hardly monoliths — Ken, who’s African-American, encounters racism among gay white men and homophobia among black community leaders. But as Cleve puts it, when anti-gay politicians declare “war on all the us-es,” then the us-es discover what makes them a we. The series’ latter section grows darker and gets rushed, losing any nuance or idiosyncrasy in exposition-heavy dialogue. It’s stronger when it filters history through personal stories, as it does in the evolving relationship between Cleve and his father (David Hyde Pierce), a psychologist who believes that gays can be “cured” with electroshock treatment. Ms. Parker, Mr. Pearce and Mr. Williams often seem to be playing different people from their younger counterparts, in ways that can’t be entirely explained by the characters’ maturing. But Mr. Williams (“The Wire,” “Boardwalk Empire”) brings particular vulnerability to the older Ken, who struggles with addiction. Night 4 concentrates on the court fight for marriage equality. Curiously, Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 decision that legalized same-sex marriage in all 50 states, gets only a postscript, along with a screen card noting that violence against L.G.B.T.Q. people and other minorities is increasing. Reality supplied its own postscript. “When We Rise” was meant to air four consecutive nights, but the last three were pushed back a day by Tuesday’s address to Congress by President Donald J. Trump, who promised to defend gay and transgender citizens from terrorist violence in his nomination acceptance speech but who recently rescinded Obama-era protections that allowed transgender students to use the bathroom corresponding with their identity. The mini-series itself doesn’t refer to the current administration. It simply leaves the viewer with a sense of a long journey rewarded — but one that doesn’t always move in a direct line forward. \nWhen We RiseMonday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday on ABC A version of this review appears in print on February 27, 2017, on Page C2 of the New York edition with the headline: The Unending Struggle for Gay Rights.
