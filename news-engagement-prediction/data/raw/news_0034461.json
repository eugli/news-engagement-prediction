Azmin drops bombshell poser, but... \nHeadhunter: A minister resigning over integrity? You must be joking. I can't think of any BN minister who qualifies. They all don't have the gumption nor the courage to resign. They are already too deep in the muck. \nThey will only resign when the ship is actually sinking and the captain made to walk the plank. They wouldn't want to be dragged into the deep by him. \nLet them all go down with the ship. They don't deserve any better. Let's pray that they will all one day have their day in court and face honest judges and prosecutors. \nEven at this moment, I suspect many of them are in fear of the knock on their door and thinking of a way out. I hope they remember that time is not on their side. First come, first save! \nDont Just Talk: Any Umno minister with dignity would have resigned from his post with the 1MDB scandal and the US$681 million wired into his/her boss’ personal account. \nOf course, with the salary and perks, and not forgetting other benefits, it will deter them from resigning. \nAnonymous 539281478077880: Any of the Umno ministers can resign. It makes no difference to many of us. After all, it's high time that they go. Why go one by one? It’s best to go en bloc to save the country from further damage. \nAs it is, we are all suffering from the high cost of living. Don't waste your time, Malaysiakini , in looking for the \"brave\" minister. I hope it's not a gimmick, Selangor MB Azmin Ali. \nRM2.6 Billion Turkey Haram: It’s not surprising that a senior minister quit over 1MDB scandals. \nHow long can those Umno and BN leaders pretend that they do not know who \"MO1\" (Malaysian Official 1) is, and that he had allegedly siphoned RM2.6 billion into his bank account? \nAnonymous #44199885: It will be a surprise if any minister were to resign. The current lot do not have the interest of the rakyat to heart. \nBy their inaction, they are all complicit in 1MDB and the destruction of our institutions. They are also party to the incredulous attempts at dividing this nation along religious and racial lines and turning the very fabric of the nation founded by the forefathers into something they never intended. \nNot even Abdul Razak Hussein could have seen this as being the product of Umno that he once led. \nWhere our ministers have failed, the Johor royal house has stepped in and worked to bring the people and nation together. \nThe forces for change now must be led by the royal houses - to save this nation from our democratically elected representatives in BN. \nWorldly Wise: Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein ought to leave BN and join DAP. His father was a man of impeccable integrity. His grandfather wanted a political party that was not community-based. \nHis father and grandfather ought to be closer to him than his wayward cousin. \nNot Convinced: And here’s from a Nobel laureate Bob Dylan: “How many times can a man turn his head. And pretend that he just doesn't see?” \nPua: I hope Salleh is just feigning ignorance on 1MDB \nAries46: Communications and Multimedia Minister Salleh Said Keruak is not feigning ignorance. He is tasked with hiking up the BMF (Bumiputra Malaysia Finance) and Bank Negara forex bogey over the 1MDB heist but finds the ‘tai chi’ barrel empty. \nIt’s a tall order to water down RM39.8 billion to RM1 million but who better than Salleh? But his comparison is an anomaly akin to comparing apples with oranges. \nNeither BMF nor Bank Negara’s forex scandals were directly linked to Dr Mahathir Mohamad, he was never implicated in stealing those funds and the amount of prosperity and employment he brought to the people in the 80s and 90s is beyond comparison by any other prime minister and a fraction of the alleged losses. \nComparatively, whatever we are now faced with in terms of the nation, its governance and peoples’ welfare is the opposite. \nSalleh, would do well to dwell on these factors rather than just the amount of losses which is misleading. \nVictor Johan: Salleh should welcome a debate with Petaling Jaya Utara MP Tony Pua or sit in a forum to trash out and convince the greater rakyat instead of being in confinement of his blog or spew occasionally and shamefully to a supportive Umno audience. \nMushiro: Thank you, DAP parliamentarian Tony Pua for simplifying and clearly listing down again the total debt of 1MDB as guaranteed by the Malaysian government. \nI hope Pua will further simplify this especially for Salleh as this could be too difficult for him to understand. \nVersey: This country could never progress with people who condone scandal to such extent yet got the cheek to call on the people to move on without holding those responsible for such crime. \nPua, you have earned the respect and support of all fair-minded people. \nBasically: These Umno clowns are real jokers. After putting Dr M on a pedestal for decades, now they blame all the corruption on him. So what were they doing for the past 20 years, if not feeding off his goodies? \nWhere were all the do-gooders in Umno then? Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and Najib Razak each had a decade between them to right whatever wrongs they claim Dr M had perpetrated against their own shining examples of transparent, wonderfully corrupt-free governments. \nOnly stupid people cannot see that when they cry corruption at their ex-leaders, they are only implicating themselves. So, that's what they think their voters are - idiots. \nThe above is a selection of comments posted by Malaysiakini subscribers. Only paying subscribers can post comments.
