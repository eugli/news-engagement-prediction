\nREAL MADRID’S $700 MILLION DEAL \nReal Madrid have sold their internet image rights to US company Providence Equity Partners for $700m over 10 years, according to El Confidencial. \nThe company already own 25 per cent of the MLS internet image rights and have reportedly been in negotiations with club president Floretino Perez over Real’s. \nPerez, who is up for re-election this season, has reportedly been desperate to improve the club’s finances following the recent Deloitte Money League report. \nAfter 11 years on top, Los Blancos were pushed down to third in the list of highest revenue generating football clubs behind Manchester United and Barcelona, according to the report. \nBut up until now, Real's image rights have reportedly been an untapped revenue source for the La Liga clubs.

Even before the match we eat this. Pasta; not often. I don’t like pasta. \n“I never saw chicken burgers. I saw deep-fried chicken and it was very good, I like it a lot.” \nThe 2015-16 Premier League-winning boss also described how his relationship with the players is the same despite one win in the last nine league games. \nHe said: “The dressing room is fantastic. We try to do our best, but this season everything is wrong. \n“The relationship is the same as last season. \n“I speak the same s*** English and they understand me. No problem.

That changed today. Sometimes you see the real face of a footballer on the field.” \nBut now Dutch website Voetbal International has published what caused RvP to react like that. \nHe said: “[Ozyakup] started things by talking to me in Dutch, but I could not hear what he was saying. \n“When I got close to him he began cussing at me. I thought he was joking and I shook my head and asked, ‘What are you doing?’ \n“Oguzhan continued cursing me, and after I took a free kick, he said: ‘You are old, you have nothing here. Go have fun with the old people!’” van Persie plays the villain 0:49 \nKOSCIELNY QUESTIONS WENGER’S TEAM SELECTION V CHELSEA \nArsenal went down 3-1 to Chelsea last weekend and now it seems Laurent Koscielny has questioned the team selections made by his manager. \nThe French defender told SFR: “I think we played certain players after others and I think we should have played more as a team and with much more movement. \n“There was space, because they allowed us lots of space, after which they wanted to hit us on the counter. \n“We must stay together, pick ourselves up and then the confidence and victories will come back.” Arsenal's French defender Laurent Koscielny (R).

For Eden Hazard’s solo 50-metre goal, he sent Francis Coquelin flying before Koscielny backed off to allow the Belgian to score. \nHe also admitted the Gunners’ Premier League title chances could be over after consecutive defeats to Watford and the Blues. \n“It’s going to be hard now. Mathematically it’s not done but we know it’s going to be difficult,” he said. \n“We need to come back to the quality of our game; our passing and movement.” Hazard out does himself", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T10:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T05:56:00.481+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
