Posted Tue 7 Feb 2017, 7:39pm Updated Tue 7 Feb 2017, 8:28pm By James Purtill What do young conservatives think of Cory Bernardi? \nSoon after Cory Bernardi left the Liberal Party to form his own party, the Australian Conservatives, the Young Liberals put out a short statement thanking him for his years of service and mentoring: \n\"While we are deeply disappointed to see him leave our cause, we wish him well nonetheless.\" \nBernardi is a massive, divisive figure in the South Australian Liberal Party, and over the years he has employed many of the state's Young Liberals as staffers. This includes the current President of the South Australian Young Liberals, Robert Katsambis ( Hack understands Mr Katsambis is no longer a Bernardi staffer. He could not be reached for comment). \nThe statement hinted at some of this potential turmoil. \nBernardi has been a member of the conservative or right-wing faction of the Liberals. He's against gay marriage, the Safe Schools program, planned pregnancy. He says the burqa is a \"shroud of oppression\" and should be banned. He also denies humans are causing climate change. \nThe Young Liberals' annual national convention this year was held in Adelaide. Two prominent members of the Liberal right - Tony Abbott and Eric Abetz - gave speeches. Prime Minister Turnbull happened to be in South Australia while the conference was happening but he didn't attend. \nSince Bernardi's split, Hack has spoken with young Liberal voters, as well as those who prefer to call themselves young conservatives. The picture that emerges is complicated. Some say Bernardi is a cynical opportunist who got himself re-elected through the Liberal Party and then quit seven months after the election (he only got about 2,000 first preference votes). Some say that anyone who supports Trump will vote Bernardi (he has a red hat printed 'Make Australia Great Again'). Others see him as appealing mainly to an older crowd of social conservatives - as another version of Family First. \nNone of the young people Hack spoke to thought Bernardi's decision to leave the Liberal Party was a good idea. Some feared the Liberal party was drifting to the left, abandoning its centre-right base, and the \"moderate careerists\" (the Turnbull faction) would take over. But none of the people who expressed this fear showed any interest in leaving the party and supporting the breakaway. Will he pick up votes of young Liberal voters? \nKurt Tucker, president of University of Queensland's Liberal Nationals Club and a member of the Young Nationals, told Hack he was a \"huge Bernardi fan\". \n\"I place myself very very much on the right side of the Liberal party,\" he said. \n\"My thoughts on the Bernardi issue is that it's always better to stay within the party,\" he said. \"If the party is lurching to the left, the exodus of conservatives is taking away some of the key voices of the right and playing into hand of more moderate faction.\" \n\"The Liberal party is the only right of centre party in the world going backwards in its primary vote. I think [Bernardi] is going to pick up a lot of sympathy, but I don't know if it's the right climate to pick up seats, because of One Nation's rise as well.\" \nHe said the split would hardly be felt in Young Liberal circles outside of South Australia, partly because most of the members of the youth branch were \"careerists\" - they were unlikely to side with Bernardi and risk not getting a political staffer job. \"I think generally the youth vote is not going to be the target of One Nation or Australian Conservatives,\" he said. \nJohn Slater, a 23-year-old writer for the magazine Spectator , said some of the Young Liberals in South Australia \"idolised\" Bernardi. \n\"But at the same time they are quite loyal. \n\"You would paint yourself as pariah in the party if you did go over. You would be ending your career in the Liberal party. Of the ones I do know, I'd be surprised if a whole lot of them did.\" \nKurt Tucker. \nSam Mitchell. \nSupplied \nBernardi's departure may even attract young people to the Liberals. Sam Mitchell, a 25-year-old from Adelaide, quit the Liberal Party last month after seven years. \"The reason for the resignation was because Bernardi was still a member,\" she said. \n\"I think he was a liability.\" \n\"He was an incredibly undisciplined member of the party who has been holding Turnbull back on progressive policies like same sex marriage and Safe Schools.\" \nShe said he could pick up the votes of young farmers. \"He has a tremendous amount of support in the rural sectors,\" she said. \n\"Any young person who is a Trump supporter is a Bernardi supporter.\" Will he pick up the votes of Trump supporters? \nIn his big speech to the Senate today, Bernardi didn't mention Trump, or otherwise signal he was looking for votes from Trump supporters in Australia. \nInstead, he spoke about respecting traditional establishment values. \nSenator Bernardi said his new party, the Australian Conservatives, would focus on limiting the size of government and provide hope to \"those who despair at the current state of Australian politics\". \nAs a 23-year-old former member of the Young Liberals told Hack , any party with the word conservative in its name was unlikely to appeal to the kind of disenchanted voters who had supported Trump. \n\"Are they going to be attracted to a conservative when they want someone who's going to blow up the joint a bit?\" she said. \nShe also said Bernardi wouldn't win the support of young Liberal voters. Among her young conservative Sydney friends, many were calling Bernardi's decision to leave the party an act of \"cowardice\" and \"treachery\". None supported Bernardi. \n\"There's a saying you have to be in it to win it. \nThe moment you leave the party as a conservative, the party becomes less conservative.\" \n\"Some people are saying it wasn't the best thing to do but they can see where it's coming from. They think ever since Turnbull the leadership hasn't connected with the base.\" \nCory Bernardi wearing a \"Make Australia Great Again\" hat. \nTwitter: Cory Bernardi \nJeremy Travers, a 25-year-old former Young Liberal, said a better US politics model for Bernardi was Ted Cruz - the Texas senator who had campaigned against Trump in the primaries. Cruz is anti-abortion, pro-free trade, and tough on crime. Bernardi supported him until Trump won the nomination. \n\"Trump is not a conservative, he's a populist,\" Travers said. \n\"I'm not sure if Cory's brand of politics will work.\" \n\"I'll happily confess I'm no fan of Bernardi. I do have immense questions about his timing. He was elected as a Liberal and sat on the backbench for seven months causing nothing but havoc. Then he says the party is not conservative enough for me.\" \n\"The guy has just proved to us he's a bit of a joke.\" \n\"There are very few young conservatives in the country, that I've come across. Most young people are moderates, progressives, and lefties.\" \nJohn Slater said the closest model for Bernardi was Bob Day - the South Australian Family First Senator who was re-elected last year on 2.9 per cent of the vote. \nFamily First picked up 25,000 first preference votes. Of these, about 5,500 were votes for Bob Day. \nThat's not exactly Trump-size figures. \nDay resigned in November to look after his business, and at least some of these social conservative/economic liberal voters will be up for grabs in 2019.
