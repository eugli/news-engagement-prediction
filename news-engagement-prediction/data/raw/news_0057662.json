And while in most expat households, either the husband or both husband and wife work, there are some cases where, owing to circumstances, the woman is left to fend for the family. Khaleej Times brings you the story of three such brave and resolute Dubai women who are running their households with pride in the face of adversity. When Saira got married 20 years ago, she could have never imagined her husband would abandon her, leaving her to fend for herself and their six daughters in a foreign country. Life was simple but smooth for Saira until her husband lost his job in a real estate company a few years ago. Since then, the family has suffered tremendously due to financial constraints that followed the job-loss. As time passed, things became more difficult in the absence of any stable income. Saira decided to support the family in whatever way possible. She tried starting a catering business from home. \"I don't get too many orders for catering. So I also started with henna services to add to my income,\" Saira told Khaleej Times . Her earnings, however, do not meet the demands of the family of eight. Her husband's joblessness and unending financial issues gave way to conflict between the couple. \"We had an argument recently after which my husband left home without saying anything. I have no one to take care of my daughters and me. I don't know where my husband has gone.\" She and her husband are from Pakistan but have been living in the UAE for decades now. Saira hasn't heard from her husband for over a month now. She has tried calling him and tracing him, but in vain. Now, she is left alone to support her six teenage daughters in Dubai. \"My children have had to take breaks from school time and again. I was able to get discounts for the education of two of my daughters,\" Saira says. But despite all the difficulties, Saira is determined to let her daughters continue education. \"I will do anything to support their education. I won't let them suffer in life further.\" Similar is the story of Ishrat's struggle, which began when her husband lost his job a year back. Hailing from India, she has been living with her husband in the UAE for 12 years. \"My husband had been working in Dubai for 15 years before he lost his job,\" Ishrat told Khaleej Times . The couple has three school-going children. They have been facing tough time paying the bills and rent besides the fee of their children. While her husband tries hard to find himself a job, Ishrat boldly took the family responsibility on herself. \"I began home delivery of rice and flour. Besides, I sell jewellery, which I get from my friends. They pay me commission as per sale.\" \"But paying rent and school fees gets really difficult. Our landlord increased the rent by Dh10,000 annually this year,\" she says. Ishrat, however, says she's determined to support her family as long as she can. Then there's Amira, whose husband survived a fatal road accident in 2016. After three months of recovery, Amira's husband was terminated from the job. Over the past year, the family has struggled to meet their daily expenses. \"My husband had a miraculous survival. It took him months to get out of the bed. But just few days after he joined, he was terminated,\" Amira told Khaleej Times . The family has been taking loans to pay the school fee of their son and clear the bills. \"I am trying to support the family. I sell clothes to my friends to get some money and do some tailoring. But it only helps us to feed ourselves.\" Even as Amira is a Pakistani national, she has been born and brought up in the UAE. \"We cannot even go back to our country because we had taken some loans here which we need to clear.\" Amira says she is considering withdrawing her son from the current school as they are unable to pay the fee. \"I have been taking loans from people to pay his fee. But now I think we will have to send him to another school with less fee.\" Whatever it may take, she says, she will ensure that her son's education continues. There are many such brave women in Dubai who have been doing more than their fair share of work to ensure a better future for their families. Their stories may be different, their circumstances may differ, but what connects them is their unwavering determination and resolve to achieve the best possible life for their children and families.
