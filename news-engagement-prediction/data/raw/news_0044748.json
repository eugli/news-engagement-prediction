In addition, General Manager Mitch Kupchak has been relieved of his duties, effective immediately. Furthermore, Jim Buss will no longer hold his role as Lakers Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations. \n\"Today I took a series of actions I believe will return the Lakers to the heights Dr. Jerry Buss demanded and our fans rightly expect,\" Jeanie Buss said. \"Effective immediately, Earvin Johnson will be in charge of all basketball operations and will report directly to me. Our search for a new General Manager to work with Earvin and Coach Luke Walton is well underway and we hope to announce a new General Manager in short order. Together, Earvin, Luke and our new General Manager will establish the foundation for the next generation of Los Angeles Lakers greatness.\" \n\"It's a dream come true to return to the Lakers as President of Basketball Operations working closely with Jeanie Buss and the Buss family,\" said Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson. \"Since 1979, I've been a part of the Laker Nation and I'm passionate about this organization. I will do everything I can to build a winning culture on and off the court. We have a great coach in Luke Walton and good young players. We will work tirelessly to return our Los Angeles Lakers to NBA champions.\" \nJeanie Buss added, \"I took these actions today to achieve one goal: Everyone associated with the Lakers will now be pulling in the same direction, the direction established by Earvin and myself. We are determined to get back to competing to win NBA championships again.\" \nRegarding Mitch Kupchak, Jeanie Buss stated, \"We are grateful for the many contributions Mitch has made to the Lakers over the years and we wish him all the best.\" \nWith regard to fellow owner and brother, Jim Buss, Ms. Buss said, \"Jim loves the Lakers. Although he will no longer be responsible for basketball personnel decisions, he is an owner of this team and we share the same goal: returning the Lakers to the level of greatness our father demanded. Our fans deserve no less.\" \nIn addition to the changes made within the basketball department, the Lakers also announced they have parted ways with John Black who had been the Lakers Vice President of Public Relations. Chief Operating Officer Tim Harris will immediately begin a search for a replacement. Jeanie Buss added, \"We thank John for his many years of service.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:46:21.609+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
