Because, as Tur noted, the source told her that one of the calls in December was almost entirely devoted to the sanctions that the Obama administration had just imposed on Russia. \n“The questions are many,” Tur stated. “A number of them surround just how much of a conversation did General Flynn have about Russian sanctions with the Russian ambassador. How much could he have possibly forgotten?” \nShe continued, “I was speaking with a high-level source last night who said they just don’t understand how he could have forgotten the conversation because it was the subject of pretty much an entire phone call.” \nThe MSNBC host added that it is unclear exactly what was said at this point because the transcripts are not publicly available. \nWatch the clip above, via MSNBC. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T00:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T19:54:06.646+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
