RIGHT: Ryan Rua hit a long two-run homer in the first inning against right-hander Kyle Zimmer. The Rangers expect to use Rua primarily against left-handers, but he had a .396 slugging percentage for 139 at-bats against right-handers last season. \nSURGE CONTINUES: Delino DeShields had another noteworthy offensive performance. He stole second in the first and properly executed a safety-squeeze bunt to drive in a run in the second. \nLOTS OF PITCHES: The Rangers planned on Yu Darvish getting through the first two innings on about 30 pitches. He had several deep counts and came out after 1 2/3 scoreless innings with 37 pitches. Darvish averaged a career-low 15.7 pitches per nine innings last season. \nTHE BREAKDOWN \nThe arms: RHP Mike Hauschild, the Rule 5 addition from Houston, worked two scoreless innings and struck out the side in the sixth. Hauschild is a ground-ball pitcher, but he averaged 7.7 strikeouts per nine innings in the Triple-A Pacific Coast League last season. ... In the fifth, LHP Andrew Faulkner jammed Mike Moustakas, a left-handed hitter, and retired him on a grounder. ... RHP Preston Claiborne, of Carrollton Newman Smith, came over from the minor-league camp and stranded an inherited runner while finishing the second. \nThe bats: DH Shin-Soo Choo accounted for three outs in his first two at-bats. In the first, Choo struck out with a runner at third and none out. In the second, he grounded into a double play against LHP Scott Alexander. ... Andy Ibanez, brought in from the minor-league camp, homered as a pinch-hitter in the fifth. \nThe gloves: In the second, 1B James Loney grabbed a hard-hit grounder by Raul Mondesi and threw out Christian Colon trying to score from third. ... In the third, RF Travis Snider made an ill-advised dive for a two-out sinking liner by Hunter Dozier, of Denton. Snider missed, and the ball went for a triple. \nThe legs: In the first, CF Delino DeShields stole second and took third on a wild pitch that bounced a few feet up the third-base line.
