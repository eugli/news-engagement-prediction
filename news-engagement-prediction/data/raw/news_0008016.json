The long-awaited \"white paper\" is being published a day after lawmakers voted overwhelmingly in favor of a bill that once finalized would give May the authority to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty -- the formal process of leaving the EU. May gave the first real insights into her government's strategy in a speech last month , in which she committed to placing a final Brexit deal to a vote in both houses of the UK parliament. But many will hope that the white paper -- a policy document setting out the government's proposals -- provides more substance before members of Parliament next week again debate the bill that will allow the government to begin divorce talks. Hard Brexit? Read More In last month's speech at Lancaster House, May set out 12 priorities for her government's negotiation with the European Union. In language indicating a \"hard Brexit,\" she confirmed that Britain would leave the EU single market, which guarantees the free movement of goods, services and people within the bloc. She also made it clear that her fundamental aim was regain full control of immigration and lawmaking -- and that leaving the single market was the inevitable consequence. It seems unlikely that the white paper will deviate from that approach, which has dismayed those who oppose Britain's withdrawal from the single market amid fears it will damage the economy and cost jobs. It may however give more clarity on key questions such as rights for EU citizens living abroad in Britain and UK citizens living abroad in the European Union. Divorce settlement During debate in the House of Commons Wednesday on the Brexit bill, former Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne warned that the government \"has chosen... not to make the economy the priority in this negotiation\" -- and that the remaining 27 EU members were not prioritizing it either.
