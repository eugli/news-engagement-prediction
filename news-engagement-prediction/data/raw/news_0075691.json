The world’s first Fairtrade and Fairmined gold was launched in the UK in 2014 to tackle poverty and dangerous conditions faced by small-scale miners.

Lidl also began stocking Fairtrade tea and coffee last year again after delisting it for about a year. \nTea and cocoa sales both slid 3%, again partly as a result of changing habits. It is hoped that cocoa sales will get a boost this year as the Co-op becomes the first UK retailer to switch to selling and using only Fairtrade cocoa in all its own-brand chocolate products, from the sprinkles on its doughnuts to chips in its triple chocolate cookies. \nThe switch to 100% Fairtrade cocoa, covering over 200 individual Co-op products, will be completed by the end of May. It will lead to a five-fold rise in the amount of Fairtrade cocoa sourced by the retailer, taking the total tonnage from 526 to 2,848 tonnes. \nBrad Hill, Fairtrade strategy manager at the Co-op, said: “When we consider that demand for cocoa is set to rise by 30% over the next three years alone, it is imperative that we keep moving forward with sustainability initiatives in order to shape this industry.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T14:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T09:26:49.337+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
