By Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA/Rex/Shutterstock. On Tuesday afternoon, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary and communications director, walked into the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room in a dark-blue suit and a blue and gold rep tie and began his descent into his new daily psychosis. Spicer, who has the build of a division-three football player and a strikingly geometric hairline, generally conveys the demeanor of a well-intentioned company man with an appreciation for the mundane. He began his daily briefing, the ninth of his tenure, by discussing the severe weather in Louisiana before moving on to Donald Trump’s “listening session” with local sheriffs, his intention to commit more resources to the army, and then a subsequent “listening session” regarding how to make improvements to the Veterans Administration. Soon after, however, Spicer appeared to make the pivot from genial former naval public officer to his alter ego, a Mr. Hyde-esque Trump stalwart, his face contorted between anger and shell-shock. He discussed the controversial confirmation of Betsy DeVos, Trump’s pick for secretary of Education, which required an unusual tie-breaking vote cast by Vice President Mike Pence. The repudiation of DeVos, whose qualifications, views on public education, and disastrous confirmation performance were scrutinized by members of both parties, seemed to be interpreted as disloyalty to the Trump regime. “The fact that we had to get to the point where the vice president had to be pulled in to overcome the Democrats’ historic and partisan logjam of the president’s qualified nominee,” Spicer said, “is another glaring reminder of the unprecedented obstruction that Senate Democrats have engaged in throughout this process.” He continued: “The American people sent a strong message when they elected President Trump in November: they’re fed up with business as usual in Washington. Democrats in the Senate should expect that voters will remember how they stood in the way of the president enacting an agenda that put him into office.” During the bizarre, shocking, and occasionally Constitution-bending initial fortnight of the Trump administration, few have appeared to suffer more, perhaps both publicly and privately, than Spicer himself. As a long-tenured creature of Washington, who has served in various capacities around Capitol Hill since the 90s, Spicer was a generally well-liked communications director at the Republican National Committee, with a quick wit and a sense of humor. One reporter who worked with Spicer described him to me as a “chill” and “very reasonable guy.” In the last two weeks, however, Spicer has been subject to a rare and cruel, and occasionally darkly funny, form of public torture. He has, in some ways, become Trump’s very own Baghdad Bob. The day after Trump’s inauguration, Spicer baldly lied to the assembled press about the size of Trump's turnout , among other things, in a bombastic delivery that appeared part-Trump, part Sam Kinison—and decidedly unlike Spicer. He soon entered into a full-on feud with CNN‘s Jim Acosta, trashing his behavior during a contentious press conference as “rude and disrespectful,” saying, to his face, “if you behave like that again, we will have you removed.” Then came the news that Trump did not approve of Spicer’s wardrobe . And then came Melissa McCarthy’s brilliant spoof on Saturday Night Live of Spicer as a man in the midst of an existential crisis—a performance that reportedly ruffled feathers in the White House. “Trump doesn't like his people to look weak,” a source told Politico. McCarthy’s portrayal of Spicer, however, resonated with journalists who have watched Spicer transform into an adversarial, apoplectic caricature of the press secretary as superhero villain. Press secretaries around the District also immediately felt a wave of sympathy for Spicer’s circumstances. “President Trump seems to have indicated that getting along and having good relations with the press is somehow disloyal,” Rick Tyler, a flack for Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign, told Politico in the days after his first briefing, while others wondered how he would stay sane in his new job, or indeed, if he would have a job. “I’ve never heard him say an untruth or a lie before this job,” the reporter told me. “And when you have to defend people who aren’t sticking to the facts, it becomes harder to keep up a good relationship with the press.” On Tuesday evening, Acosta broke the story that Trump was disappointed in Spicer’s performance and the White House was looking to unburden him of his communications director role in order to facilitate an improvement in the briefing room. Though Spicer had temporarily taken on dual roles when the designated communications director Jason Miller left the job under a cloud of scandal , and the White House had reportedly begun searching for Miller’s replacement long before Spicer became a meme, the story was, of course, peppered with rumblings of larger divisions within the Trump White House. Acosta noted that the president blamed his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, for selecting Spicer for such a visible role. This being Trumpland, Acosta also quotes an anonymous senior official saying that Trump supported Spicer “100 percent.” (The White House did not respond to multiple requests for comment, but in Vanity Fair correspondent Sarah Ellison’s article published on Tuesday , a spokesperson said that “Sean is doing an excellent job, and everyone in the White House is incredibly supportive.”) A source close to Spicer pushed back at this characterization. “This is a dream come true for Sean,” this person said, depicting Spicer as a man with boundless energy, who worked in the midst of an “exhausted” White House. “That delivery is to show the president that he’s taking on the press corps, which is extremely important to this administration, that they aren’t getting away with anything,” this source continued, adding that beyond that “audience of one,” he was also “connecting with voters who elected Donald Trump, who believe that the media is an adversary.” He predicted that should Spicer come out of the White House alive, he would have his pick of jobs afterward: “He’s going to be the most battle-tested press secretary in an administration in modern times when he decides to leave.” A good press secretary, Bill Clinton’s former chief flack Mike McCurry once said, is supposed to work on behalf of the president and the media. “The press office has to be an advocate for the press and the public's right to know inside the White House,” he told the White House Historical Association. “Sometimes you will lose out to other priorities, but at least the press will sense that someone is looking out for its interests. That is the way to best serve the president. The modern presidency cannot work effectively if it is constantly at war with the media.“ Contrast that statement with the philosophies of the West Wing’s new power players: Steve Bannon, who all but declared war on the press by calling it the “opposition party” and demanding that it “keep its mouth shut”; Stephen Miller, who reportedly helped Bannon persuade the president to ramp up his attacks on the media; and Trump himself, who, in his last press conference, yelled at CNN that it was “fake news” . Hiring Spicer, a successful creature of Washington‘s old P.R. game and Reince Priebus’s establishment pick for press secretary, was their Trojan horse. When Spicer was initially hired in December of 2016, one could feel a wave of relief wash over the D.C. press. The Naval College graduate and father of three had been working in political communications since 2002 , building a reputation along the way as an amicable if sharp-tongued communications professional. Potomac Flacks, a blog covering the revolving door of press secretaries in Washington, called Spicer “well-known and well-liked” , and an associate of Spicer’s described him as prickly with the media but never overly so. “Republican press secretaries often have an edgy relationship with the media,” the associate explained, but Spicer was never “out of the norm” as a G.O.P. flack. This has put Spicer in a seemingly untenable position as he spars with his old contacts. “My sense is that he’s enjoyed a very good relationship with the press over the years in various capacities, including his time at the R.N.C., but he’s struggling to adapt to the Trump worldview of the press,” the associate added, noting later that “I don’t think it can sustain itself the way that it’s going.” The reporter agreed that the new role appears jarring. He recalled an anecdote in which Spicer intervened in a fistfight that broke out between a Fox News reporter and a Huffington Post reporter, telling the Washington Post afterward that he was “just trying to keep the peace.” That incident, according to the reporter, “shows he’s usually the ‘c’mon guys, let’s just have a drink’ dude, not the asshole trying to pick a fight. It’s harder to be that guy when you’re working for a bunch of brawlers.” But to Trump, Spicer is now the flack representing the accusatorial, anti-press stance of his administration. “It’s almost like the new president is a stage mom off to the side, telling Sean what to say and how to say it,” said the associate. “That’s not his normal M.O. when it comes to engaging the press, but he has to do what he has to to fulfill the wishes of his boss. That’s what you’re seeing out there.” That said, the associate believed that Spicer would regain his footing. “He needs to take a deep breath, and really just go back to who he is: a communications figure who, again, had a long relationship with people in the media, including people in that room. He has to establish a rhythm and regain that trust.” It’s unclear, however, whether the White House will let Spicer go back to his old ways and risk the wrath of a base who apparently wants to see Spicer destroy the so-called liberal media. It’s even less clear if that will happen after McCarthy’s viral impersonation. Spicer initially “thought the Saturday Night Live thing was quite funny and totally got it,” said the source close to Spicer, praising his “thick skin” and ability to focus on the issues. The White House, however, seemed to disagree: only days after McCarthy’s rage-fest went viral, Politico published a report saying that the Trump faction of the West Wing was furious that the impersonation was so accurate—and especially that Spicer was played by a woman—making him, in the words of a Trump donor, “look weak” in the eyes of Trump. Kellyanne Conway reportedly carried that anger outside the West Wing, too, and allegedly stormed out of a meeting with Capitol Hill staffers shortly after someone brought up the sketch. Her face had “turned to stone,” said a source to Politico. “They definitely did not find it funny.” In a time before Trump, Spicer may have publicly joked about the sketch, and, perhaps, privately enjoyed that the liberal-leaning Saturday Night Live had gone out of its way to parody him—a move that fits into the family man’s snarky persona, and would have certainly played well with the press. “You piss off people and move on after a few days,” said the reporter, describing how a pre-Trump press secretary would have dealt with the situation. “That’s not how the Trump White House operates. It’s a lot fieryer and they hold grudges, and they expect him to as well.” Spicer himself found the sketch “upsetting,” according to Politico, but only because he “immediately saw how damaging it could be in Trump world.” As Spicer is quickly learning, in Trump’s White House, a sense of humor—possibly the best coping mechanism one can have as a press secretary—might prove devastating.
