Or if the opposite is true, assess whether you simply arenâ€™t eating enough.' She also explains that drinking too little water can impact weight loss success. 'Dehydration can be mistaken for hunger leading us to eat more than we need. And as muscle contains approximately 75 per cent fluid, drinking 500ml water has been shown to increase metabolic rate by 30 per cent within 10 mins!' She explained. Drink more water: As muscle contains approximately 75 per cent fluid, drinking 500ml water has been shown to increase metabolic rate by 30 per cent within 10 minutes YOU ARE TOO SEDENTARY While it may sound simple, many are not aware how important it is to get out and about regularly - rather than just an hour or so at the beginning and end of the day. No matter how busy you are, getting up and moving every 30 minutes to an hour is important in getting the body fired up - and even fidgeting can help! 'Research suggests those who fidget burn hundreds of extra calories throughout the day,' nutritionist Teresa Boyce told Body and Soul . 'Fidgeting includes crossing or uncrossing the legs, stretching, standing up often or maintaining a good posture. Aim to move every 30 minutes to bump your body out of hibernation mode.'

Therefore, the scale may not be an accurate representation of your success. Instead, the circumference of your waist or how well your clothes fit may be a better gauge. Alternatively, not lifting weights can also inhibit the success of your weight loss goals. Resistance training helps to burn fat and, most importantly, helps to stop your metabolism from slowing down over time. YOU ARE STRESSED Stress can't always be avoided, but it can cause weight gain by triggering the brain to make you feel hungry - even when you are not. Although it's not always easy to cut stress out of work, it is possible to schedule in more fun. Experts suggest that everyone makes regular time for social activities every day to avoid this overwhelming cravings, with activities like hiking, dinner catch ups and even shopping is recommended.

'I am a huge advocate for balanced meals and when it comes to weight loss, protein is particularly important. Protein is believed to be more thermogenic than carbohydrates and fat, this means when we eat protein our body uses more energy to break down and digest the protein,' she said. 'Protein also supports muscle growth and maintenance, which assists metabolism and is a very satiating food.' The TV chef recommends eating eggs, nuts and seeds, legumes, yoghurt, cheese, fish and lean animal meat including turkey, pork, beef, lamb and chicken.

And the best time of the day to up the fibre? Breakfast. Ms Bingley-Pullin says people should aim for at least 30 grams of fibre daily and include things like chia seeds, oats, flaxseeds, wholegrains, fruits, legumes and root vegetables.

A study from the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that the body actually burns more calories during the day when well rested, while other studies have discovered that those who sleep for around eight hours a night burn fat faster. 'Sleep deprivation slows your metabolism and affects the hunger hormones leptin and ghrelin,' Ms Boyce said. 'Leptin tells your brain to stop eating, whereas ghrelin, produced in the stomach, stimulates hunger. Research suggests inadequate sleep is associated with low levels of leptin, high levels of ghrelin and weight gain.' She suggests people turn off their phones, get to bed early, make sure the room is dark and cool and avoid all drugs, including sleeping pills, alcohol and cigarettes.
