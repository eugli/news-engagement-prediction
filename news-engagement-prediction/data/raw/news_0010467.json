Most people don’t know that because it didn’t get covered. \nEven though the massacre never happened ― and therefore wasn’t covered ― a parody site has cropped up to give people a way to pay tribute to the fictional victims. The Bowling Green Massacre Victims Fund \n“We all still carry the vivid memories of what horrors occurred at Bowling Green, but some still relive those moments every day as they work to rebuild a community torn apart,” reads a statement on the site. \nA section at the bottom allows visitors to “support the victims and families directly affected by the Bowling Green Massacre.” Clicking the link will take visitors straight to the ACLU donation page . \nBecause, again, the Bowling Green Massacre never happened . \nBut, you know, donate to the fund anyway. It’s for the greater good.
