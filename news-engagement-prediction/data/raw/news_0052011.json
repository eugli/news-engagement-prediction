That was my first time being in it and it was fun to win it.\" \nGordon, however, most enjoyed the reaction of his father, Eric Gordon Sr. in New Orleans. \n\"The main thing was my dad,\" Gordon said. \"He was there. He's the one that gave me this jump shot and introduced me to this game. It was good to see him there to watch me win it. He was well-known as a big-time 3-point shooter (at Liberty University) when he played. He passed it off to me.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T10:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:59:43.487+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
