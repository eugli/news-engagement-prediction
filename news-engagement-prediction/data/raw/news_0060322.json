I called the cops once, but I decided not to press charges. I should have.”\n'THE WALTONS' CAST REVEALS SECRETS FROM SET \n“I did leave at one point, but there was no one to turn to other than friends,” she added. “There were no 12-step programs for domestic violence.”\nLife has since changed for Learned.
