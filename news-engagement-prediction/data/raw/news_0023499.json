Courtesy of Emily Walsh Emily Walsh turned her friend Shayna Sexton's 2010 wedding gown into a baptism outfit for Sexton's firstborn son, Bennett. “My husband and I got married on Nov. 27, 2010. It was our sacrament of marriage so I wanted a way to incorporate it with our first child on his special day,” Shayna Sexton, of Jupiter , Florida, told ABC News . “It’s his baptism welcoming him into God’s family and this was his sacrament, so I wanted a way to tie it all together. I couldn’t think of a better way to use it in the future.” Jimmy Ho Photography Emily Walsh turned her friend Shayna Sexton's 2010 wedding gown into a baptism outfit for Sexton's firstborn son, Bennett. Sexton’s friend, Emily Walsh, an amateur seamstress with a surprising talent, spent a month turning the dress into the precious outfit. She said one of her biggest concerns was making sure she didn’t run out of the bridal fabric. “I didn’t want to have to get something that was a different color,” she explained. “I had to measure everything perfectly because I couldn’t get any more, obviously. If I messed up, she’d lose her wedding dress and there’d be no baptism outfit. The hardest part was taking it apart very gingerly and then cutting it just perfectly. I have just a few inches of the fabric left.” Courtesy of Shayna Sexton Emily Walsh turned her friend Shayna Sexton's 2010 wedding gown into a baptism outfit for Sexton's firstborn son, Bennett. Fortunately, the repurposed outfit turned out perfectly. The beautiful lace embellishments on the wedding gown’s train was incorporated into the tiny baptism vest.

It’s really hard for me to put into words. It fills my heart with such happiness to have him here with us. His birth was a humongous day for us, and his baptism was a humongous celebration for us, and so was our wedding, and it was like bringing our wedding back full circle for our baby.” Courtesy of Shayna Sexton Emily Walsh turned her friend Shayna Sexton's 2010 wedding gown into a baptism outfit for Sexton's firstborn son, Bennett. She absolutely plans to use the baptism outfit for their future children, too. “Emily is so ridiculously talented and I am blessed to have her as a friend,” said the proud mother. “Having her make my dress into my son's baptism outfit was so special because my dress was a representation of the love my husband and I share and a reminder of our wedding day six years ago. It was amazing to have my son's baptismal gown made from my dress because he is a reflection of our love for each other and for him.” 0 Shares ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:17:04.658+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
