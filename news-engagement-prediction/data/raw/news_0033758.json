Impressive Sterling, Aguero’s chance Michael Puterflam, FOX SPORTS February 14, 2017 2:51pm \nALL the talk has been around Manchester City’s January arrival Gabriel Jesus, but it’s another new signing that could steal the future headlines. \nWith Jesus forced to exit City’s clash with Bournemouth in the 14th minute due to injury, Leroy Sane put in a superstar performance, according to former Chelsea midfielder Andy Townsend. \n“[Leroy] Sane was unplayable [against Bournemouth] - he was the best player on the pitch,” said Townsend. \nBut ex-Manchester United player Owen Hargreaves went as far as to suggest that the German, who joined Pep Guardiola’s side for £37 million last summer, could rise to the level of Thierry Henry. \n“Not only has he got great energy but he’s got a great engine,” said Hargreaves. \n“I think he has that natural ability of a young [Thierry] Henry. \n“The last four weeks he looks a superstar given the money they paid for him.” media_camera Manchester City's German midfielder Leroy Sane shoots but his shot hits the bar. \nSane was a menace for Bournemouth defender Adam Smith in the 2-0 victory. The third time he ran at the Cherries player, Sane pulled the ball back and created an opportunity for a blocked Raheem Sterling shot. \nHowever, the next time the 21-year-old tried that attack, City scored. \nDavid Silva played the ball to a charging Sane whose low cross was deflected to the far post for Sterling to tap in before anyone could react. \nThat brings us to the next standout player in City’s victory - Sterling. \nSTERLING REALLY STARTING TO PROVE HIS WORTH \nThe Englishman has struggled to find his feet at The Etihad since his £50 million move from Liverpool in 2015. \nHowever, after some time under Guardiola, he seems to finally be finding the form that made lured City into the mega-money move. \nFrom the 10th minute, Sterling was a threat on the right flank when he almost brought down a long ball with his chest to score past the keeper. media_camera Manchester City's English midfielder Raheem Sterling (R) celebrates scoring. \nLess than 20 minutes later, he tee’d the ball up for himself and volleyed from the penalty spot, but was denied by a last-gasp intervention from a Bournemouth player. \nHowever, two minutes later he connected with Sane’s deflected cross to score at the backpost. \nBut he was also instrumental in City’s second goal after bamboozling his defender to play a low cross for Aguero to spark a goal. \nThat makes two goals and two assists for the 22-year-old in his last four games for City - and he also claimed the man of the match award. \nJESUS BLOW IS AGUERO’S CHANCE \nAfter an impressive start to his City career, Jesus was brought back to earth when he was injured in a clash with Bournemouth’s Henry Francis in the 14th minute. \nThat handed the out-of-favour Sergio Aguero, who has been linked with an Etihad departure, a chance to impress Guardiola. He took it with both hands. \nDespite having his goal eventually ruled as an own goal , the manager praised the Argentine’s performance. \n“He played good, really good,” he said. “He won, he fought, he scored a goal, which for his confidence, and of course for us, is so important, and I am so happy for him. Aguero robbed of perfect impact 1:09 \nEPL: For the first time in Sergio Aguero's English football career, the striker was starting out as a substitute for the 3rd consecutive game, but was required to make an impact earlier than expected. February 14th 2017 /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/Football/EPL/ Aguero robbed of perfect impact \n“When you play in a big team with a lot of competition, like cup and Champions League, we need all the players.” \nAs for Jesus, Guardiola said: “Tomorrow morning we will know exactly (about Jesus’ injury), but in that case we were so, so unfortunate. \n“Hopefully we are going to pray tonight that it is not going to be a big issue.” \nEither way, Hargreaves believes one day Gabriel Jesus’ name, “will be one of the top 10 in football”. \nHargreaves added that the £27 million signing even, “costed less than [departed defender] Eliaquim Mangala.” City close gap despite injury 0:49 \nEPL: Manchester City have climbed into second spot on the ladder with a 2-nil win over Bournemouth.
