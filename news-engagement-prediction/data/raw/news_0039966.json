We've also revisited the lives of baseball hall of famer Ferguson Jenkins and speed skater Gaetan Boucher .\nTime may stop for no one, but Nancy Greene Raine once skied so quickly she momentarily left the folks from Omega scratching their heads.\nCanada's female athlete of the 20th century needs no real introduction for anyone who lived there — or who consumed a Mars bar while doing it.\nThe daughter of B.C.'s mountains skied three Olympics, beginning in 1960 at Squaw Valley in the U.S. (at just 16), then Innsbruck, Austria for 1964. She hit a super stride in time for 1968 at Grenoble, France, resulting in a silver in the slalom and a gold in the giant slalom.\nOne of the finest ski racers of the 1960s — as formidable on her side as France's Jean Claude Killy was on his — Greene lived by the clock, died by the clock, and on one occasion was sneakily kept from seeing the clock in order to calm her down.\nOr so her coaches thought.\nStay for tea? Greene arrived on the slopes of the Chamrouse Valley, southeast of Grenoble, as a heavy favourite for medals at the 1968 Olympics after battling back from an injury. She had won the inaugural World Cup overall title in 1967 despite only skiing six of the nine events.\nAfter finishing 10th in the downhill and taking silver in the slalom in Grenoble, the giant slalom on Feb. 15 give her a final shot at gold.\nGreene skied to silver in the slalom at the 1968 Olympics in Grenoble, then went on to win gold in the giant slalom. (Associated Press)\nLike many star athletes, the Ottawa-born, West Coast-raised 24-year-old could get a tad overwound before competition. So her coach, Verne Anderson, took his charge up to the restaurant, about a 30-second ski above the start line for the GS, for tea.\nThey chatted about this and that, the ski program, whatever came to mind as time ticked away and the race got started just below them. Head coach John Platt dropped by to add a few words.\nAnderson, you see, thought he was being sneaky, keeping The Tiger from thinking of the job ahead and getting too nervous.\n\"I was fully aware of what they were doing,\" Greene says today, over the phone from Sun Peaks Resort, near Kamloops, where she is director of skiing. \"They didn't know I knew.\"\nWith about 10 minutes to go, they all ran up the stairs from the resto, carefully made sure her Rossignol skis were properly on and adjusted, and zipped down to the start.\n\"I had just three or four minutes [behind the gate],\" Greene says. \"If you go down to the start early, you just have to sit in the snow or stand up waiting.\"\nInto the gate ninth, starter's orders, off and rolling in her smooth, technical style and 1:51.97 later the Canadian star had blown away the field by an unheard of 2.64 seconds — setting off another set of circumstances that have built into a wonderful, often repeated, though factually incorrect legend.\nNancy Greene skied so fast she broke the clock.", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/embed/CQiwimNOMBA"], "published": "2017-02-14T19:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:16:13.728+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
