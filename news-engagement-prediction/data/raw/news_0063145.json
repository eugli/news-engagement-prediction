Audio: Matt Brann reports on Indonesia's decision to increase the weight limits for Aussie cattle (ABC News) \nChief executive of Consolidated Pastoral Company, Troy Setter, said it would definitely allow pastoralists to send a wider selection of stock to Indonesia. \n\"It'll allow stations in Australia to put more weight on their cattle and reduce a lot of double-handling, which has been adding cost to northern Australia's cattle sector,\" he told ABC Rural. \n\"Prior to the 350 kilo rule coming in, in 2010, there wasn't as much handling of the trading cattle in northern Australia and by reducing the handling, it'll increase weight gains, reduce costs and improve animal welfare outcomes.\" \nChief executive of the NT Livestock Exporters Association, Stuart Kemp, said the change on weight restrictions was good news for everyone in the supply chain. \n\"Having the specifications so tight before (a weight limit of 350 kilograms), meant Indonesia were after young, premium animals,\" he said. \n\"If you look through the sale results across Australia, feeder cattle in that range are always the premium product, so if you missed that cut off, you then had to find another market and there was a big drop-off. \n\"This now opens things up, so producers, exporters and importers all have that flexibility when sourcing cattle.\" \nMr Kemp said the changes would take a lot off pressure of northern cattle producers. \n\"If pastoralists have weaners that are growing up and putting on condition, you don't want to be running them into the yards and catching them before they get too heavy,\" he said. \n\"This [change] means less handling, and more confidence that you can bring the cattle in when the cattle are ready, and when it's best for them.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T13:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T12:15:02.201+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
