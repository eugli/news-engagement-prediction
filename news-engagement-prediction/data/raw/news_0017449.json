It’s a country that has given the world the silversmith Georg Jensen, the architect Finn Juhl, and the carpenter Hans Wegner. The capital city of Copenhagen is considered a mecca for those obsessed with Scandinavian minimalism (and cool, cult home lines like Normann and Hay). When it comes to fashion, however, that sharply focused and innovative craftsmanship hasn’t always crossed over onto the runway. The divide between fashion design and home and industrial design in Copenhagen is quite wide, with only a handful of popular, impressive designers like Henrik Vibskov, Cathrine Saks and Barbara Potts of Saks Potts, and Ganni’s Ditte Reffstrup having managed to successfully market their individual points of views to both a local audience and those in industry hubs like New York and Paris.

It was commercial and contemporary, but even so one would think that in a city so steeped in art and design, the clothes might have come with a little less heavy lifting from international brands and at the very least, some decent tailoring too. At times, even the logos and their placements seemed incredibly familiar. Baum und Pferdgarten, Freya Dalsjø Photo: Courtesy of Indigital.tv As Copenhagen-favorite labels remained true to their sellable formulas, the silver lining of the week came in the form of two new designers on the roster. Cecilie Bahnsen and Astrid Andersen are the undeniable leaders of Danish fashion at the moment, each with a distinct point of view and the tailoring skills to match. Bahnsen, who is in her third season and has just been picked up by Dover Street Market, presented a romantic collection of beautifully constructed, crisp white shirts worn with knits, embellished fishnet dresses, and eyelet capelets—Scandinavian in its minimal color palette and tight edit, and innovative in its poeticism and smart construction. Then there was menswear designer Astrid Andersen’s first full women’s collection, which included a bold mash-up of luxury, hip-hop culture, and basketball gear. As some of her peers were unable to do successfully, Andersen gave us a different perspective on how to wear clothes inspired by the streets.

It was refreshing to see that there are indeed young Danish designers who want to make thought-provoking wares and not just give the well-heeled Instagram-ers what they want. That’s just the sort of modernization that Scandinavia has always been known for.
