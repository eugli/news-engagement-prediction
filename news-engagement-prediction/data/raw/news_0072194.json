Slot to Denver Broncos Newsletter Newsletter \nThe next time Matt Paradis reports to Dove Valley, he'll spot a familiar face. \nPer 9News' Mike Klis , the Denver Broncos on Saturday will hire Chris Strausser as their new assistant offensive line coach. An NFL source tells Klis the sides are in the \"final stages\" of a deal. \nStrausser has come up in the coaching ranks primarily at Boise State, where he worked with Paradis, the school's starting center in 2012 and 2013. Strausser held two stints at Boise State, from 2001-05 and 2007-2013, before leaving to coach the Washington Huskies' offensive line in 2014. He also spent 2006 as a Colorado Buffaloes assistant. \nWelcome to Denver @Coach_StraussUW . Broncos got a great assistant O Line coach in him. He was my coach at CU for one year. \nWhat's next for the Denver Broncos? Donâ€™t miss out on any news, take a second to sign up for our FREE Broncos newsletter! \nAn interesting nugget, via Klis, is that Strausser is credited with helping Paradis, a defensive lineman during his freshman year of college, make the transition to offense. Paradis, of course, has gone on to become the NFL's premier pivot man, grading out as Pro Football Focus' top-rated center in 2016. \nStrausser replaces John Benton , who recently bolted Denver for a position with the 49ers. Benton was hired by the Broncos in January, but John Elway let him out of his contract to take a promotion in San Francisco. \nStrausser will report to new Broncos OL coach Jeff Davidson . \nFollow Zack Kelberman on Twitter: @Kelberman247 Author ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T22:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T04:14:51.261+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
