Suddenly they said no, this is the latest,\" he said. \nAzeez - who spoke to reporters in a meeting room near the Nautical Aliya's bridge - however thanked the Bangladesh government for allowing the ship to dock at Chittagong. \nThe Nautical Aliya is carrying some 2,100 tonnes of aid cargo for Rohingya refugees, and it was originally allowed to go to Chittagong after initial plans to go to Teknaf were denied. \nHowever at about 10am on Monday, the ship was directed to anchor about 6km from Cox's Bazar, where it was visited by a Navy captain. \nAzeez said some of the organisers went over to the Navy ship for a further meeting on the matter that would last some three hours. \nHowever, a call from Dhaka to the Navy ship informed them of the change in plans, prompting the change to Chittagong in spite of a message from Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak received by Azeez which said that Chittagong's port was too crowded. \n\"This is not a normal mission. This is not business as usual,\" Azeez said when asked why Bangladesh would change its plans. \nHe added that negotiations between the two countries were \"healthy\", and said that though Chittagong was busy, the ship would be getting a \"special route\" to dock there. \nAzeez also said that the seas in the area near Cox's Bazar area were rough. \n\"God willing,\" he said, when asked if the mission would still end on the 18th as he had previously claimed. \nWhen asked if the mission would be delayed, he said that the plan was for Chittagong and that the organisers had not cancelled logistics. \nIt is not known whether all of the ship's volunteers would have the necessary visa approvals to get off on land in Bangladesh and to visit the Rohingya camps there. \nThe Nautical Aliya is expected to reach Chittagong's port at about 11pm Monday. \nChittagong is some 140km from Cox's Bazar, which has Rohingya refugee camps nearby. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T18:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T13:44:59.818+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
