Ashley Carter reports. (Feb. 21) Story continues below \n“I don’t understand why you’re sitting on me,” the man said. \n“Because I’m trying to explain to you that your feet shouldn’t be on the seat,” she responded. \n“OK, but why does it matter to you? I can do whatever the f— I want to.” \nREAD MORE: TTC streetcar driver, passenger get into intense argument over fare \nThe man later appears to gently push the woman aside and she pushes the emergency alarm. \n“I shouldn’t be having to touch a lady. Like get off me. You put yourself on me …You pushing that (alarm) is just disrupting everybody else,” the man said. \n“We’re a society. We all have to live together,” she said later on. \nAt the end of the video, the two can be seen leaving the subway car. \nREAD MORE: Video shows TTC bus driver with foot on dash, eating chips while driving \nShylo told Global News that she thought the woman “should have just walked away” and went elsewhere. \n“I think she just instigated the entire incident by continuously like antagonizing him and harassing him,” Shylo said, adding he could have “simply took his feet off the seat.” \n“Everyone came from an anger mindset, so nothing was going to be resolved that way.” \nShylo said the train held at the subway station for only a couple of minutes. She said the woman spoke with TTC staff. \nREAD MORE: ‘Go back to your f—ing country’: Videos show racist altercation on Toronto streetcar \nTTC spokesman Stuart Green told Global News there isn’t an active investigation because the parties went their separate ways. He said passengers could potentially be issued a fine if caught by transit enforcement staff. \n“In terms of feet on seats, that’s actually a violation of Bylaw 1 of the TTC and it can result in a fine of about $245,” Green said. \nGreen said the use of the passenger alarm was proper in this instance, but cautioned against getting riders about getting into these types of arguments. \n“It’s always a concern to us when our customers are getting into disputes like this. We’d rather they didn’t take it into their own hands.” \nREAD MORE: TTC testing 1-person train operation, union says it will decrease safety \nMeanwhile, Shylo said she regularly sees passengers putting feet on seats, but she doesn’t think the behaviour is going to change anytime soon. \n“Even though that they say that there is a bylaw that if you put your feet up you’re going to get a fine of $250 … it’s something I would not bother arguing for. I would not waste my time because I don’t think it’s going to change … I don’t think it’s a big deal.” \nNiki Anastasakis contributed to this report. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
