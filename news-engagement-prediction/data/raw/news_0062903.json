Here are eight names to watch on deadline day. (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 9:48 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 9:48 a.m. ET \nNo matter what becomes of the rest of the NBA’s trade deadline, we should already be declaring the wheeling, dealing period a success. Not only have we seen Orlando deal away a big rotation piece like Serge Ibaka , but we got a ground-shifting blockbuster when the Kings gave — er, traded — away DeMarcus Cousins to cap All-Star weekend . \nMinor deals on Tuesday and Wednesday (Bojan Bogdanovic to Washington, Ersan Ilyasova to Atlanta, Lou Williams to the Rockets) have filled in some gaps on playoff teams, but there’s still a chance teams could further electrify this deadline period with big-time deals on Thursday. Heck, even Paul George leaving Indiana is a possibility. \nAnd there’s more. Among star players and role-fillers, there are still some potentially important deals coming. Here are eight names to watch as the deadline steamrolls ahead: Derrick Favors, Jazz \nFavors could be the most prominent victim of luxury-tax fears since James Harden was shipped out of Oklahoma City. OK, maybe not that prominent. \nThe Jazz are slated to begin paying Rudy Gobert $93 million over the next four years, and will likely have to pay Gordon Hayward a contract that begins in the $30 million per year range after next season. Should Favors, who has been battling a knee problem all year, bounce back next year and produce like he had been (16.4 points, 8.1 rebounds last season), he will be in line for a major raise, too. Not the same money as Hayward, but in the $20-million–plus range, which would put the Jazz in the difficult position of committing about $80 million to the trio of Gobert, Hayward and Favors beginning in 2018-19. \nWILBORN: How Hayward broke the mold to became \"the man\" in Utah \nThat’s untenable. The Jazz have thus felt out the market for Favors, though his troubling knee history has swatted his value downward. Utah doesn’t want to sell low on Favors, and that could force them to wait and re-investigate the market either in the offseason or early next year, should Favors look healthy enough to re-establish his value. Danilo Gallinari, Nuggets \nAccording to league sources, Denver has been pushing for a trade of forward Wilson Chandler first and foremost as the deadline approaches. But Gallinari remains much more popular among teams with something to offer. Chandler has $12 million on his contract for next year, and an option for $12.8 million the following year. That’s not terrible for an average-ish forward like Chandler, but he turns 30 in May, and his best days are likely behind him. \nMORE: Who won the Nuggets-Trail Blazers center swap? \nGallinari is a more interesting case. He has played well this year, coming back from a difficult, injury-marred three seasons. He has been out with a groin injury since Feb. 1, though he should return soon. If he is traded and plays well down the stretch, he will almost certainly opt out of the final year of his contract, slated to pay him $16 million. In that case, he becomes a short-term rental, and his value dips. So the fact that Gallinari has been averaging 17.2 points and shooting well from the 3-point arc (38.1 percent) has actually hurt his chances of being traded. \nThe Nuggets have held fast to the need to get back a first-round pick for either player. Jimmy Butler, Bulls \nBy now, the Bulls probably should have determined a direction for the franchise, but there continues to be a Keystone Cops feel to the approach John Paxson, Gar Forman and ownership have taken to the roster. There’s dysfunction, but still a sense that the Bulls can cobble together a decent second half, make the playoffs and declare the season a success (a low bar for that, admittedly). \nDEVENEY: Why hasn't a Butler-to-the-Bulls deal happened? \nIf the Bulls decide to plow forward with a Butler deal, they could kick-start rebuilding with draft picks and youth, and perhaps give beleaguered coach Fred Hoiberg a chance to start over with a less skeptical and less veteran-heavy group of players. It would require an admission of mistakes from some notably stubborn folks, which might yet be a longshot, but it’s a good way to establish a franchise-wide reset. Carmelo Anthony, Knicks \nRemember him? The best efforts of the Knicks to find a new home for Anthony ahead of the trading deadline appear to have fallen short, and unless a late revival of talks with the Clippers spares Phil Jackson, Anthony is staying put. \nMORE: Derrick Rose addresses possible reunion with Tom Thibodeau \nFor now, at least. The Knicks will go into Thursday looking to push veterans onto the rest of the league, hoping to bring back draft picks. But the contracts given last summer to guys like Courtney Lee (four years, $50 million) and Joakim Noah (four years, $72 million) are proving to be difficult to move. The possibility of dealing Derrick Rose for Minnesota point guard Ricky Rubio emerged on Tuesday, but that would lock the Knicks into the remaining two years and $29 million of Rubio’s contract. By dawn on Thursday, Rose looked bound to stay in New York. \nRegardless, should the deadline pass without a Knicks move, the team will revisit Anthony’s future with him in the offseason. Anthony was reluctant to waive his no-trade clause this month because he didn’t like how the organization handled his situation. But a Knicks-Melo divorce still feels inevitable. P.J. Tucker, Suns \nTucker might be the surest bet to be moved on Thursday of any player on the market. He is in the final year of his contract, he can be a solid wing defender for a contending team and he won’t cost much either in salary (final year of a deal paying $5.3 million) or assets needed to acquire him. \nMORE: The art of NBA players trolling fans about trades with emojis \nIt’s that last aspect that has Phoenix sitting tight until late in the game. Ultimately, they’d like a first-round pick in return for Tucker, even a future first-rounder that they can package in a trade down the line. But because Tucker is mostly likely a rental, teams that are interested in him have been reluctant to part with a pick. The hope for the Suns is that the horde of teams interested in Tucker — Utah, Boston, the Clippers, Denver, Minnesota, Atlanta, Chicago — will wind up creating enough bidding as the deadline approaches to convince some team to give up a first-rounder. Andrew Bogut, Mavericks \nThe Mavs are hoping that they can draw a similar outcome with Bogut as the Suns are looking for with Tucker. They’re aware that Bogut has not been deemed worthy of a first-rounder to this point, but what happens when contending teams looking to beef up for a playoff run feel they’ve got to get something done at the deadline? \nMORE: Pacers should learn from lessons of DeMarcus Cousins, Deron Williams \nBogut has not been healthy, but he has a championship pedigree, having anchored the Warriors’ defense in consecutive trips to the Finals. The fact that he has struggled to get on the floor might prevent any team from getting desperate enough to give away a first-round pick, but if he can be had for a couple of second-rounders and bounces back down the stretch, he could be the kind of low-risk, high-reward gamble who would pay off for a contender. \nAnd Bogut isn't the only Mav possibly on the move --- point guard Deron Williams has been on the market and could be gone by deadline time, too. Darren Collison, Kings \nIn the wake of the Kings’ blockbuster trade of DeMarcus Cousins, they’ve continued to look for ways to rebuild by sending away other noted veterans. But the fact is, Arron Afflalo — with another $12.5 million on his contract next season and his 32nd birthday looming in October — has very little value left around the league, and Ben McLemore didn’t have much to begin with. \nVECENIE: DeMarcus Cousins deal an all-around failure for Kings \nCollison is a different story. His contract, paying him $5.3 million this year, expires in the summer and despite an off-court guilty to plea to a domestic violence charge this summer, he has done well when on the court this year. He has averaged 17.3 points on 50.9 percent shooting from the field in his last 13 games, and potential playoff teams in need of point guard depth (Atlanta, Charlotte, Milwaukee) have had some interest in Collison. Jahlil Okafor, Sixers \nThe Sixers have seen two potential trade partners — Portland and New Orleans — look elsewhere for a deal, whittling down the number of suitors for their erstwhile young big man. But, as we’ve been saying, Philadelphia is absolutely not in a hurry to make a deal here. It would be preferable, sure. Okafor wants out, and the better the Sixers treat him in this case, the better it is for their reputation among players and agents. \nMORE: Sixers add yet another center in deal with Hawks \nPhiladelphia, though, can easily revisit an Okafor deal in the offseason, and it’s unlikely his value is going to change much in the interim. For now, the Bulls still have an interest, as do the Pacers. The Mavericks have long been a dark horse for Okafor, and the now-rebuilding Kings could insert themselves into the chase.
