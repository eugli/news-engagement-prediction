Ã— I studied millionaires for 5 years, and I found that they read differently than most of us Jan. 31, 2017, 4:49 PM 6 print \nRead to educate yourself, not just for fun. Oli Scarff/Getty Images \nThe other morning I was dressing for work and caught an interview on Good Morning America with E. L. James, the author of \"Fifty Shades of Grey.\" \nI was somewhat shocked when the host highlighted the fact that James' book had sold 165 million books worldwide. \nAs I pondered that thought, my shock was replaced by dismay. It dawned on me that many people only read for entertainment and not to learn. \nHowever, the rich read books that educate. \nIn my Rich Habits Study , I interviewed 233 wealthy individuals (177 of whom were self-made millionaires) with at least $160,000 in annual gross income and $3.2 million in net assets. \nAccording to my research on the wealthy: 85% read two or more books a month for education and learning purposes 63% listened to educational audio books during their commute to work 88% read 30 minutes or more each day for purposes of education and learning 58% read biographies of famous successful people 51% read history books 55% read self-help books \nOnly 11% of the rich read for entertainment purposes. Billionaires like Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg devote many hours a day to reading for the purpose of learning. \nIn short, the rich deserve to be rich because they put in the work that success requires. And part of that work is reading to learn. If you only read for entertainment, you are one of the 99%. If you read to learn, you are doing what the top 1% do. \nSuccess isn't easy. It's a process that requires doing certain things every day that move you toward realizing your dreams and achieving the goals behind those dreams. Part of that process requires that you read every day for at least 30 minutes, solely for purposes of education. If you ignore one component, the entire process breaks down. \nThomas Corley is the author of \"Rich Habits: The Daily Success Habits of Wealthy Individuals,\" and \"Rich Kids: How To Raise Our Kids To Be Happy And Successful In Life.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T04:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:26:40.432+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
