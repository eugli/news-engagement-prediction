Phil Hillyard Source: News Corp Australia \n“He’s a very good player and also very experienced,” Cowboys football manager Peter Parr said of Fensom. \n“With the loss last year of James Tamou and Ben Hannant, we have lost a bit of experience, so he ticks a couple of boxes there. \n“He has come to us late in the piece and we were well-prepared to go with the squad we had put in place this season. \n“But we were clear that if an opportunity arose to sign a quality player, then we would pursue that, and Shaun Fensom is a quality player. He plays in a position where we think we need to add some depth.” \nFensom will begin training with his new club on Monday and will be available to play in round one — against the Raiders. \nFensom’s departure from the Green Machine comes a day after winger Edrick Lee was also immediately released to take up a deal with Cronulla. \nDo you live in Queensland?
