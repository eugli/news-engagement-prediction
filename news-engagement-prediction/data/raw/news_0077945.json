More than 100 headstones have been vandalized at the Jewish cemetery in Philadelphia, damage discovered less than a week after similar vandalism in Missouri, authorities said. ( AP By The Associated Press \nPHILADELPHIA-- Stacy Silver prayed as she drove with her husband to Mount Carmel Cemetery in Philadelphia's Wissinoming section Sunday: Please don't let my mother and great-grandmother be among the victims. \nWhen Silver, 50, of Cherry Hill, N.J., heard about the vandalism at the Jewish cemetery that occurred overnight Saturday, she rushed to her loved ones' graves. \nWhat she saw when she arrived was worse than she imagined -- tombstone after tombstone, story after story, was toppled to the ground -- including those belonging to her mother and great-grandmother. \n\"Your stomach just drops,\" Silver said. \"I mean it's just horrible.\" \nDetectives canvassing the cemetery Sunday afternoon estimated that 75 to 100 headstones had been knocked over. \n\"It's criminal. This is beyond vandalism,\" said Northeast Detectives Capt. Shawn Thrush, as he walked the cemetery grounds. \"It's beyond belief.\" \nThe vandalism, coming a week after a similar incident in St. Louis, prompted the Anne Frank Center to call for President Donald Trump to make a forceful denunciation of anti-Semitic hate crimes. \n\"Mr. President, it's time for you to deliver a prime-time nationally televised speech, live from the Oval Office, on how you intend to combat not only #Antisemitism but also Islamophobia and other rising forms of hate,\" the organization posted Sunday on Twitter. \"Whether or not your intention, your Presidency has given the oxygen of incitement to some of the most viciously hateful elements of our society.\" \nThe Southern Poverty Law Center recorded 1,372 bias incidents between Trump's inauguration and Feb. 7, the watchdog group reported. Among those, the group highlighted 57 incidents in 24 states of anonymous bomb threats being called in to Jewish Community Centers. The organization has also recorded that the number of hate groups in the U.S. grew in 2016 for the second straight year, with a threefold increase in the number of anti-Muslim hate groups. \nThe incident at Mount Carmel prompted support from the national Ahmadiyya Muslim Community USA. \n\"We are deeply troubled by these rising and ongoing attacks on our Jewish sisters and brothers and members from our Philadelphia chapter are in route to assist in clean up,\" said Nasim Rehmatullah, the organization's national vice president. \nMount Carmel Cemetery is one of four graveyards located on each corner at the intersection of Frankford and Cheltenham Avenues. No noticeable vandalism was visible at the other three cemeteries, which all appear to be for Christians. \nIn a statement Sunday, Mayor Jim Kenney offered condolences to the families affected and said police would find and charge those responsible. \n\"Hate is not permissible in Philadelphia,\" he said. \"I encourage Philadelphians to stand with our Jewish brothers and sisters and to show them that we are the City of Brotherly Love and Sisterly Affection.\" \nIn a post on Twitter about the incident, the Anti-Defamation League said: \"We are appalled to see the desecration of another Jewish cemetery. These attacks need to end now.\" \nThe vandalism was similar to that the previous weekend in suburban St. Louis, Mo., where vandals knocked over 154 headstones at the Chesed Shel Emeth Society cemetery. Vice President Mike Pence, who visited the cemetery, condemned the damage as a \"vile act of vandalism\" and said \"there's no place in America for hatred or acts of prejudice or violence or anti-Semitism.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T19:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T16:29:59.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
