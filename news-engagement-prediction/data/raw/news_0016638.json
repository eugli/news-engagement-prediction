DeMarcus Cousins (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 9:26 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 9:26 p.m. ET \nTo any NBA teams looking to trade for a former Kentucky center now residing in Sacramento, well, Willie Cauley-Stein might still be available. \nKings general manager Vlade Divac shut down trade rumors surrounding DeMarcus Cousins in no uncertain terms Monday, delivering a strong statement to ESPN's Marc Stein : \"We're not trading DeMarcus. We hope he's here for a long time.\" \nTRADE RUMORS: These 12 big men could be on the block \nSpeculation about Cousins' status with the Kings spiked last week when Arizona Sports reported the Suns could get Cousins with a package including center Alex Len, small forward T.J. Warren and a first-round draft pick. Stein reports Divac met with the three-time All-Star to make it clear Cousins will not be on the trade block ahead of the Feb. 23 deadline. \nDivac's declaration adds further credence to reports from January that Cousins intends to sign a massive five-year Designated Player extension worth more than $200 million this summer under the new collective bargaining agreement. The 26-year-old has one year and $18 million left on his current contract before he could become an unrestricted free agent in 2018. That seems less likely now, as Divac told Stein, \"We are going in that direction\" regarding extension negotiations. \nCousins is in the midst of his best season as a pro, averaging 28.1 points, 10.6 rebounds and 4.7 assists per game while shooting 45.3 percent from the field and 36.7 percent from 3-point range. From a talent standpoint, he's the best center in the NBA. \nLAWRENCE: Kings, Cousins would both regret huge extension \nThe concerns have never been about Cousins' talent, however. They've alway come down to his erratic behavior and his ability — or inability — to coexist with his teammates, coaches and NBA referees. To be fair, Cousins has improved his behavior and limited those explosive on-court incidents. One of Cousins' former teammates told ESPN's Kevin Arnovitz that we are seeing a different Cousins under Kings coach Dave Joerger than the one we saw under George Karl last season. \n\"I'm not saying [Cousins] is perfect,\" the anonymous teammate said. \"But none of that stuff you heard about with George happens this year.\" \nPerhaps the Kings believe \"Boogie\" has finally turned a corner and can be the foundation for a franchise that has been running off the rails for quite some time.
