I hope the president is talking about The Steve Miller Band and not that kid who embarrassed the White House this morning. #SweatsLikeMarco https://t.co/IqHiOXtE3V \n— Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) February 13, 2017 Miller was awful on every level. When I hear the White House praising him, they sound like they’re living in an alternative universe. https://t.co/rXkTTNJI4D \n— Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) February 13, 2017 The Steven Miller interviews this morning on all the Sunday shows were frightening! Sorry Mr President. No.. A really bad sign… \n— Mika Brzezinski (@morningmika) February 13, 2017 If the WH thinks that is a person they want to put out front-it’s beyond sad for our country.
