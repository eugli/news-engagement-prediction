There's nothing especially interesting about this from a baseball perspective, as he has no real chance of making the major league club out of spring training – and probably not at any other point, either. The only real reason to care about this is because Tim Tebow is Tim Tebow . So here we are, caring about Tim Tebow . \nTim Tebow's arrival to spring training was accompanied by a press conference, in which the Heisman Trophy winner laid out his goals for next few weeks. In case you were wondering, Tim Tebow was the only non-roster invitee whose arrival at spring training was accompanied by a press conference . \n\"That’s my ultimate goal,\" Tebow said about playing in the majors . \"But I’ve had so much fun training, pursuing it. I enjoy the process, and hopefully I’ll have a chance to (play in the major leagues) someday.’’ \nAt least one Mets fan was ticked off to see Tebow get so much attention at the expense of MLB regulars. \nA fan standing behind me at #Mets game: \"They have Tebow, but not Granderson. Are you kidding me?\" pic.twitter.com/qJVJbaWxsW — Ken Davidoff (@KenDavidoff) February 26, 2017 Author", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T03:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:29:57.666+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
