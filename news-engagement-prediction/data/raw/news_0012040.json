That chicken was one of the stars of the summer, and it’ll soon return, The O reports : Bettinger and the rest of the Laurelhurst team are opening a brick and mortar called Big's Chicken . And it’ll add whole chickens and more to those juicy thighs. Big’s Chicken will set up shop in the venue formerly home to Big Ass Sandwiches , at 5663 NE Glisan St. — tentatively next month. Also on the Big’s Chicken menu are Laurelhurst Market’s house sausages, barbecue whole and half chickens, on-tap beers, and a few cocktails. Speaking with Eater last summer, Bettinger said the “Five-Napkin Chicken” idea was the result of a trip to Columbus, OH. \"We ate a ton of hot chicken,\" said Bettinger. As hot chicken is native to Nashville, those flocks are clearly migrating across the nation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T03:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T10:20:02.455+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
