But it was clear that people here did not need to be reminded of what Adenan has done for them as many were still grappling with their loss. \n“I am still very sad about his passing,” said villager Sehot Deri from Kampung Semunin Jaya. \nClutching a booklet with a photo of Adenan and his wife Puan Sri Jamilah Anu on the cover, the 66-year-old said that she owed a lot to him. \n“He really looked after my welfare. He helped me get a bank account and it was thanks to him that I have this house to live in. He was like a father to me,” she said. \nSehot said she was happy with the choice of Jamilah as Barisan Nasional's candidate in the Feb 18 by-election. \n“She always accompanied Tok Nan on his visits here and everyone knows her,” she said. \nIn Sematan, coffeeshop owner Lau Peng Jaw, 56, said news of Adenan's death came as a shock to the small Chinese community there. \n“We could not believe it at first. He was such a good Chief Minister who helped everyone equally. \n“Even though the Chinese population in Sematan is less than 1,000, he gave generously to our schools and community activities. He also got along well with everyone,” he said. \nLau feels that Barisan will win the by-election easily because the people of Tanjong Datu have always been strong supporters. \n“The Government takes care of us and has brought development to the area,” he said, adding that the Opposition had very little presence in the constituency. \nBarisan is facing local-based Opposition parties PBDS Baru and State Reform Party Sarawak (STAR) in a three-cornered fight. \nVegetable seller Mahada Elok, 57, hopes the by-election will bring more visitors to Sematan, a small coastal town on the western tip of Sarawak. \nShe also wants to move to a more conducive spot to sell her produce compared to the market premises she has been trading at for about a year. \n“Business is not so good at the new market because it is not easily seen from the roadside and not many people come here,", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T04:29:09.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
