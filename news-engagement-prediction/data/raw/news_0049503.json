Sadiq Khan hints he is open to London driving ban to cut pollution \n\"But when you're mates with somebody, when you've got a special relationship, of course you are side-by-side with them in times of adversity but when they are wrong you call them out.\" \nHe added: \"I think this ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries, ending the refugee programme is cruel and it's shameful. \n\"In those circumstances we shouldn't be rolling out the red carpet.\" \nMrs May has been criticised for offering Mr Trump a state visit too soon in his already highly controversial presidency. \nBarack Obama only received an invitation after 758 days, while it took 978 days before his predecessor, George W Bush, was offered a state visit, compared with seven days for Mr Trump. \nTory MP Sir Nicholas Soames defended the invitation, even though Mr Trump's visit will be \"very controversial\". \nHe told Peston on Sunday: \"I think the Prime Minister was absolutely right to do this, I think this is very important and I think President Trump will make a state visit here. It will be very controversial but it's very important that he does.\" \nIn Westminster Hall on Monday, MPs will debate a petition - signed by more than 1.85 million people calling for the visit to be stripped of the trappings of a state occasion in order to avoid causing \"embarrassment\" to the Queen. \nThey will also consider a rival petition, backed by 311,000 signatories, demanding that the visit goes ahead. \nWhile the debate proceeds, protesters will gather for a rally in Parliament Square which organisers claim will attract more than 20,000 people. \nCabinet minister Liz Truss defended the Prime Minister's decision to seek close links with the Trump administration. \nThe Justice Secretary told Sophy Ridge on Sunday on Sky News: \"These are our most important international allies. Of course, we should work with the US.\" \nShe added that \"of course we don't agree with everything that happens in the US\" but \"that doesn't mean we shouldn't work together\". \nMs Truss said: \"The US is vital - our partnership with the US, and in fact Europe's partnership with the US is vital for our economy, it's also vital for our security. \n\"I think the Prime Minister's work in securing that agreement on Nato was really, really important. \n\"There are big issues, big threats in the world that we face at the moment and it's important that countries work together.\" More about: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T20:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T15:03:07.097+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
