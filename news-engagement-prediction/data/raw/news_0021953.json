Photo: BCCI Vijay and Pujara shrugged off occasional discomforts to help India overcome the loss with their fifth century stand of the current home season.\nOff-spinner Mehedi Hasan induced a couple of edges but could not separate the batsmen despite some occasionally comic running between the wickets. \nIn one such mix-up, both batsmen found themselves at the same end. But Mehedi could not collect a throw and dislodge the bails at the non-striker's end which could have sent Vijay, then on 35, back to the pavilion. \nVijay brought up his fifty in 82 balls and went on to hit Shakib Al Hasan straight back for the only six of his knock which also contained 12 boundaries. \nPujara edged Mehedi to Bangladesh captain Mushfiqur Rahim after a composed 83, and left-arm spinner Taijul Islam bowled Vijay around the leg after the break at tea. \nThere was no real respite for the tourists, however, as Kohli scored freely against the limited bowling resources of a team ranked eight places below India. \nThe right-hander needed 130 balls to bring up his fourth century in seven Tests, reaching the mark with his 10th boundary.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T00:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T16:42:08.170+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
