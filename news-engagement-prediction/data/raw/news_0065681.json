They want it a lot, of course they want it a lot. But I don’t think they want it more than us.

Ferguson won four League Cups (Photo: Getty) \nThe word ‘if’ is a big thing in football,” he said. “But I think it’s more important for the club than myself. \n“I have so many good things in my career that I wouldn’t be influenced by a little detail like that. \n“At the beginning I was looking more to my personal accomplishments – now I’m more and more a club man. \n“It’s the club that’s ­important. The club won a trophy last season. Let’s try to win another one this season. Mourinho won three League Cups with Chelsea (Photo: Getty) \n“Plus, the quality and dimension of our football is important, and I realise that by the reaction of the fans. \n“Their happiness and empathy with the way the team plays is important.” \nThe League Cup was the first trophy Mourinho won with Chelsea in 2005, proving the launchpad for the huge success that followed in his first spell there. \nAnd the self-proclaimed Special One knows victory tomorrow could have a similar effect at Old Trafford and be the catalyst for a new era of success. \n“When you have a taste of good things, you want to repeat it,” he added. “I think when you get used to winning and you don’t win, you miss it. You don’t accept it and you’re always chasing more success.” poll loading Who will win the EFL Cup? 2000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:39:13.616+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
