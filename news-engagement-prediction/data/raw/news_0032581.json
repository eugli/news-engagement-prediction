There might just be a hidden fortune in your next bag of chips. \nThat seems to be the lesson from an eBay auction for a \"unique Cheetos that looks like Harambe the gorilla .\" It ended Tuesday morning with a winning bid of $99,900 (Â£79,970, AU$130,750). Auction insanity Here's what 1-percenters bought on eBay in 2016 \nHarambe was the ape shot by zookeepers last year when a young boy fell into his habitat at the Cincinnati Zoo. The adult male silverback has continued to live on as a persistent meme . Heartfelt tributes to him circulated on social media, but the meme soon became weird and reportedly even led to write-in votes for Harambe in the 2016 US Presidential election. \nAn eBay seller who typically sells Blu-ray discs attempted to sell the Cheeto vaguely shaped like a gorilla three previous times over the past month. Each time it got zero bids. \nOn the fourth try, it took nearly a week for the first bid of $12 to finally come in. Then the auction seems to have gotten a little help from the Twitter account \" @FatKidDeals \" and its 86,000-plus followers. \nThis Superman-shaped Cheeto is now selling eBay for a $5,000 starting bid. eBay screenshot by Eric Mack/CNET \nAfter that account tweeted a link to the auction Sunday evening, bids started to come in , and within 24 hours the price rocketed to over $90,000. \nSmelling the sweet aroma of all that cash, copycats are already hot on the trail. \nAnother kind-of gorilla-shaped Cheeto is currently going for over $75,000 on eBay. Most ridiculously, a screenshot of the original Harambe Cheeto auction taken with just one second left for bidding is fetching $10,000. \nHustlers of shaped snacks aren't just capitalizing on the Harambe phenomenon. Cheetos shaped like Superman , Jesus and Donald Trump are also on offer. \nRemember folks, always look before you snack. Don't waste a potential fortune on your appetite.
