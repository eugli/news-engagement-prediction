He was 88. \nCustis made pro football history Aug. 29, 1951, when he became a starter with the CFL’s Hamilton Tiger-Cats, who confirmed his death Thursday. \nHe starred at quarterback with Syracuse University and was selected sixth overall by the Cleveland Browns in the 1951 NFL draft. But the former college roommate of Al Davis — the late Oakland Raiders coach and owner — was told he’d play safety with the club, a move he resisted. \nThe native of Washington, D.C., opted to sign with Hamilton instead, starting every game under centre in his first season. \nCustis moved to running back the following season and in 1953 helped Hamilton win the Grey Cup game, downing Winnipeg 12-6. \nCustis finished his pro career with the Ottawa Rough Riders, playing running back in 1955-56. \nAfter football, Custis returned to Hamilton, enjoying a long career as a teacher and school principal. He also got involved in coaching at various levels over 31 years. \nHe compiled a 74-20 record over eight seasons with the Burlington Braves of the Canadian Junior Football League, including three Ontario championships and two Eastern Canadian titles. It was there Custis coached tight end Tony Gabriel, who’d later star in the CFL with Hamilton and Ottawa before being inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame. \n“RIP Bernie Custis, my Burlington Braves coach & the one responsible for my getting a scholarship at Syracuse. A great friend and a mentor,” Gabriel said on his Twitter account. \nCustis led the Sheridan College Bruins to six OCAA and Eastern Canadian titles (1973-78) and spent eight seasons as the McMaster Marauders coach. He registered a 31-23-1 record and was named Canadian university football’s top coach in 1982. \nBefore Henry Burris and Damon Allen and Warren Moon and Chuck Ealey, there was Bernie Custis \nCustis was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 1994 and in 2015 received the CFL’s commissioner’s award from Jeffrey Orridge. \n“Bernie Custis changed the face of our game forever,” Orridge said at the time. “Before Henry Burris and Damon Allen and Warren Moon and Chuck Ealey, there was Bernie Custis. \n“Many of us here tonight would not have had the opportunities we’ve had, were it not for people like Bernie Custis.” \nCustis is also a member of the McMaster University Hall of Fame and Syracuse University Athletic Hall of Fame. \n“Our deepest condolences go out to the family and friends of Bernie Custis, former #Ottawa Rough Rider and member of the @CFHOF,” the Ottawa Redblacks said on their Twitter account.
