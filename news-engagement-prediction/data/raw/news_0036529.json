Almost always clad in a suit and tie, he could be mistaken for a homicide detective. \nMore than 25 years ago, Holmes was a victim of gun violence himself. He was shot in the leg and had to learn how to walk again. \nFor decades, he’s counseled shooting victims’ families and urged the public to help solve murders. When she just 11 years old, his late daughter helped him pass out flyers asking the public to call the police with information about violent crimes. \nHolmes became a community activist as an aide to former Ald. Terry Peterson (17th) and former state Rep. Milton Patterson, D-Chicago. After Patterson left office in 2009, Holmes continued to work on behalf of senior citizens, victims of domestic abuse and families of homicide victims. \nIn 2015, Holmes joined Chicago Survivors, a nonprofit group funded in part with taxpayer money that works closely with the Chicago Police Department to counsel murder victims’ families. \nCrisis responders like Holmes are available 24/7 to rush to the scene of a murder or a hospital — wherever the surviving family members are. He explains everything from what to expect at the Cook County Medical Examiner’s office to how a typical murder investigation unfolds. \nThe crisis responders were funded under a U.S. Department of Justice grant. In 2015, they earned about $40,000 a year, city officials said. The federal funding that supported Chicago Survivors ended last year, but Chicago is continuing to support the organization with $250,000 in city funding in 2017, officials said. \nHolmes, who holds a state license that allows him to work as a private investigator, is also the president of Operation Restoring Justice, another nonprofit group that works to recover victims of human trafficking. Most of the victims are young women who are forced into prostitution. \n“We return them to their families, get them back in school and back on track,” he said. \nIn recent years, the FBI, the Cook County Board of Commissioners and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People have all recognized Holmes for his work. \n“He’s been a great partner with the administration and the police department,” said Adam Collins, a spokesman for Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who went on the Steve Harvey show to proclaim Feb. 26, 2014, as Andrew Holmes Day in the city of Chicago. \nDespite the accolades, the work takes its toll. \nIn an interview Wednesday, Holmes briefly lost his composure as he talked about the latest tragedy in his life. He choked up as he spoke of his slain 11-year-old cousin. \n“She loved to dance,” he said. “They are a close-knit family. It’s tough, man. But I can’t give up. You can’t give up. If I give up, I’ve given up on everybody, everybody I love.” Previously from Chicago News ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T19:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T02:06:18.589+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
