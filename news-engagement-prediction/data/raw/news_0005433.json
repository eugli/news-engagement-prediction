On Thursday, a response filed by the school into court includes evidence that Briles and his staff were not only aware of but intervened in the discipline of players during his tenure with the Bears. \nEmails and text messages filed in response to another libel suit (filed by former director of football operations Colin Shillinglaw) reveal that Briles, Shillinglaw, other assistant coaches and even former athletic director Ian McCaw were all tied to a pattern of covering up wrongdoing by arranging cooperation from authorities and legal representation. \nBriles' text messages, some of which can be read below, serve as particularly damning evidence to his claim of ignorance. In 2013, there are multiple examples of Shillinglaw texting Briles about a wide range of player legal incidents. \nFrom the court filing, explaining the \"see no-evil, report no-evil system\" under which the team operated: \n[Pepper Hamilton] found that such player misconduct had been systematically brushed off or kept away from Judicial Affairs - the University body charged with the responsibility of investigating and disciplining student misconduct. The football program was a black hole into which reports of misconduct such as drug use, physical assault, domestic violence, brandishing of guns, indecent exposure and academic fraud disappeared. In all, investigators compiled a lengthy list of such offenses, which had gone largely unknown to the rest of the University. \nThese cases showed that Coach Briles, Shillinglaw, and certain of his assistants had enabled a culture within the program that treated football players differently by making sure they would not face the normal disciplinary processes and consequences that regular students would have faced. The law firm found evidence that Briles relied on Shillinglaw to line up legal representation for players who had run-ins with the law. Some Briles' texts: pic.twitter.com/zn0y6Q1SKp — Jenny Dial Creech (@jennydialcreech) February 3, 2017 \nIt is going to be extremely difficult for another program to justify hiring Briles and those mentioned in the court filling as this news runs in direct conflict with the message that Briles and his former colleagues have been riding ever since the scandal erupted in May. \nSince his dismissal, Briles has denied having any knowledge of the numerous alleged rapes and Title IX violations within his program, and he filed the lawsuit because he believed school officials were implying in interviews that he did. \nBriles' decision to drop the suit came less than a week after new revelations about the Baylor program under Briles. A lawsuit filed against Baylor last week alleges that 52 \"acts of rape\" by 31 Baylor players , including five alleged gang rapes, took place at Baylor between 2011 and 2014. Briles took over the Baylor program in 2008. \nThe lawsuit also claims the program used sex to sell the program to potential recruits, with players arranging for \"women, alcohol and illegal drugs\" to be available for recruits at off-campus parties.
