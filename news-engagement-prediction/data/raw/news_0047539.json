It’s actually more of an oversized quadcopter drone, much like the Ehang but minus the enclosed passenger seat. It was created as “an extreme sports instrument,” reports The Verge. \nHoversurf says that they intend for “amateur and professional navigators” to make use of the Scorpio-3. With such an exposed and precarious pilot’s seat, this is one ride where it’s best to keep all hands and feet within the vehicle. ADVERTISEMENT \nThe design for the Scorpio-3 was said to have been inspired by heavy-duty sport-utility motorbike frames. Movement is likened to surfing through the air by changing the vehicle’s altitude and direction. \nThe Scorpio-3 is definitely a cool-looking piece of modern engineering. However, considering the proximity of the rotors to the rider’s feet, it certainly can qualify as an extreme vehicle.
