The co-founder and CEO of Global Health Corps, and the daughter of former President George W. Bush, Barbara will speak at the annual luncheon for the health care and family planning organization&apos;s Greater Texas branch.\nOf course, as a strict opponent of abortions, George W. wasn&apos;t so big on reproductive rights for women, but former First Lady Laura Bush —Barbara&apos;s mom—has supported legal abortion \"on a handful of occasions,\" as the Texas Tribune notes . Barbara also has friendly ties to Cecile Richards , Planned Parenthood&apos;s president and the daughter of late Texas governor Ann Richards.\nGlobal Health Corps, the non-profit Barbara co-founded, has ties with Planned Parenthood and a few other family-planning organizations. Part of its job, she told the New York Times in June, is to raise awareness for Planned Parenthood: \"If we can demystify that and create channels into Planned Parenthood and other exceptional organizations, then we&apos;ll have an army of people working to solve health problems.\"\nBarbara&apos;s organization, which \"mobilizes a global community of young leaders to build the movement for health equity,\" lists Planned Parenthood&apos;s national and global organizations and a branch in Zambia as partners, as well as a family-planning organization in Malawi. However, Richards told BuzzFeed that this might be the first time Barbara has actually spoken at a Planned Parenthood event.\nThe benefit comes at a divisive time in Texas for women&apos;s reproductive rights: Just last week, judge Sam Sparks blocked Texan lawmakers&apos; efforts to cut Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood.", "external_links": ["https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/19/fashion/cecile-richards-barbara-bush-and-the-sisterhood-of-political-progeny.html", "https://www.buzzfeed.com/tomnamako/barbara-bush-headline-planned-parenthood-fundraiser?utm_term=.wj3rzkdn9#.qikE7mrng", "http://nymag.com/thecut/2017/02/barbara-pierce-bush-to-speak-at-planned-parenthood-event.html", "https://www.texastribune.org/2017/02/24/barbara-pierce-bush-headline-planned-p/"], "published": "2017-02-26T06:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T00:11:15.302+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
