Puppy farmer jailed for making a ‘small fortune’ selling sick animals he knew could die \nThey allegedly gave the youngsters crack cocaine to make them ‘more compliant’ before subjecting them to a string of horrific sex acts between 1996 and 2006. \nA court heard when police raided their home in Northampton they found a baseball bat under the bed inscribed with the words ‘The Pain’. \nProsecutor David Herbert QC said Nicholas fired a crossbow at one of his victims and made him stand in front of a dart board at their home. \nHe said: ‘Nicholas Taylor would also throw darts at him. If he moved he could be hit.’ Nicholas Taylor appearing at Leicester Crown Court yesterday (Picture: SWNS) \nThe court heard Nicholas was the ‘dominant figure’ in the abuse against 11 male and female victims, ten of whom were children. Ryanair warns all flights between UK and Europe could be suspended \nJurors were told one girl was injected with amphetamines to get her hooked and then driven to a layby to perform sex acts on a man. \nAnother boy was made to carry out sex acts on Nicholas and Joan in return for crack cocaine, the court heard. \nNicholas, 47, admitted cruelty at Leicester Crown Court yesterday in relation to forcing a boy to stand in front of a dart board while he fired a cross bow at him. \nJoan, 43, has admitted four counts of indecency with a child, four counts of engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child and one of cruelty to a person under 16.
