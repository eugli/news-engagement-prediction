Cancel Under Obamacare, mammograms are fully covered by your health insurance. It's unclear what might replace it and what the consequences will be. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images) \nBreast cancer patients are rightly concerned that a repeal of the Affordable Care Act will threaten their health. The fears of these women are being shared daily within our Breastcancer.org community, as well as among many other breast cancer groups across the nation. But women who have been diagnosed with the disease are not the only ones who should be worried. Since we're all at risk of developing breast cancer, all women should see the repeal of ACA as a serious threat. \nThe ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, has provided important, and in many cases, life-saving protections for women with breast cancer. It has also made early detection and access to medical care a reality for many who could not afford it before the law was enacted. \nHere's what Obamacare has done for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer and what could be lost if it's repealed: \nNo-Cost Breast Cancer Screenings \nUnder Obamacare, mammograms are fully covered by your health insurance . According to a recent study, eliminating cost-sharing for mammograms has significantly improved compliance with recommended screening guidelines among all socio-economic groups. It's especially encouraging that utilization of these tests improved even among poorer and less educated women who historically have had low rates of screening. \nObamacare also provides free genetic counseling and BRCA testing for those who qualify for these tests to identify gene mutations that put women at high risk for breast and ovarian cancer. Without these subsidies, many women would not be able to afford the high-cost of genetic tests. \nBoth mammography and genetic testing is essential to help women diagnosed with breast cancer receive the best care possible from the very start. They also provide important opportunities for conversations between health care practitioners and patients on ways to reduce breast cancer risks. Our ultimate goal should be to focus on prevention, which is the best and least costly form of a cure. \n[See: A Tour of Mammographic Screenings During Your Life .] \nNo Coverage Limits \nBefore Obamacare, there were caps on how much an insurance plan would spend on a person's health care over her lifetime. Breast cancer treatments are extremely expensive and, for many patients, these limits on lifetime coverage meant either bankruptcy – brought about by the huge bills they'd have to cover themselves – or forgoing the treatment they needed because they couldn't afford it. Obamacare changed that by banning lifetime limits on coverage; this applies to all health insurance plans, not only those purchased on the public exchange. If lifetime limits were to be reinstated, they could again devastate individuals and their families. \n[See: What Not to Say to a Breast Cancer Patient .] \nNo Denial of Coverage for Pre-Existing Conditions \nOne of the most crucial provisions breast cancer patients gained with Obamacare is that no insurance company can deny you coverage or charge you more for that coverage because you have a pre-existing condition. Before Obamacare, insurers could refuse to pay for treatments related to pre-existing conditions, deny coverage altogether or charge a higher price for that coverage. These practices were inhumane, resulting in patients with a breast cancer recurrence or metastatic disease being denied a basic right in their most vulnerable state. As one Breastcancer.org community member wrote recently about her fears of losing Obamacare and having to pay the $10,000 monthly cost for her medication, \"A person should not have to choose between food, housing or paying for insurance so we can live.\" \nWe don't yet know what may replace Obamacare if it is repealed, but any reduction in the key benefits provided under the ACA threatens the health of women and the nation. In countries that limit access to medical care, women are more likely to be diagnosed with later-stage disease, receive lower quality care and die from breast cancer. These are the practices of third–world countries! The United States must to do better than that. Obamacare has brought us a step closer to providing every woman access to the medical care she needs, allowing her to return more quickly to a productive and meaningful life at home, at work and in her community. 7 Innovations in Cancer Therapy Slideshow What to expect in cancer care (iStockPhoto) \nFor the past nine years, a panel of scientists and doctors at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio has picked 10 medical innovations they predict will have a significant impact on improving patient care during the upcoming year. The selections are unveiled at the clinic’s annual Medical Innovation Summit. The theme of this year’s summit, held last week, was Innovations in Cancer Therapy. U.S. News talked to two Cleveland Clinic physicians, who shed light on the cancer-specific innovations over the past several years that have the biggest ongoing impact. Personalized genomics (iStockPhoto) \n“A lot of what we have learned is that the one-shot gun approach for all breast cancers or lung cancers [does not work],” says Michael Roizen , an internist who chairs the Wellness Institute at Cleveland Clinic. Tumors have “considerable genetic variability that indicates that certain treatments are appropriate,” he adds. Genomic-based blood tests can determine which treatments would be most effective in fighting the cancer, sparing patients unnecessary and toxic drugs. “Genomics is just now beginning to reach its full potential,” Roizen says. “I think this is the year of the breakthrough of individualized treatments for tumors.\" Immunotherapy (iStockPhoto) \nUnderstanding tumors’ genetic profile can also unveil how they evade our immune system, Roizen adds. “When they learn that, we'll have a large ability to go past where we are now,” he says. But already, there has been headway in training the immune system to fight cancer. In 2011, the drug ipilimumab emerged for the treatment of multiple melanoma, a form of skin cancer that “was once a death sentence,” Roizen says. Ipilimumab has greatly extended the longevity of melanoma patients. “I expect this is the start of it,” Roizen says. “This class of drugs has huge potential use,” especially in solid tumors. Hepatitis C drugs stop liver cancers (iStockPhoto) \nHepatitis C is a liver disease that can morph into cancer. Last year, a drug called Sofosbuvir, the first oral Hepatitis C treatment, was in the final stages of Food and Drug Administration approval. A year later, the drug has been approved and is “extremely popular,” Roizen says, adding that the drug holds “tremendous benefit for the baby boomer generation,” which disproportionately suffers from Hepatitis C, since the blood supply was not screened for the disease until 1992. Intra-operative radiation therapy for breast cancer (iStockphoto) \nRecent studies have shown that a single shot of targeted radiation called intra-operative radiation therapy – which is given at the time of breast surgery – is just as effective in treating breast cancer as whole breast radiation over several courses. The latter approach, which is more toxic, Roizen says, has also been “psychologically and physically problematic.” He adds that targeted radiation “does away with a lot of that, and the outcome is just as good. It’s a treatment that, for many women, will decrease side effects and improve outcomes. Many more women are willing to go through it.” CT scans for early lung cancer detection (iStockphoto) \nPeople who quit smoking have traditionally worried about their risk of developing lung cancer. And this has traditionally been a neglected group because X-rays have not been able to pick up small nodules that could morph into cancer. Now a CT scan provides 3-D images of lungs. The scan has “strong prognostic value as to whether you are likely to get lung cancer,” Roizen says. “It’s helping a group of people who have quit smoking stay well. It will spot [nodules] early enough to treat and doesn’t lead to adverse effects for the individual. That’s a real psychological benefit.” Selective genomic testing (iStockPhoto) \n“If we test large populations of patients, are we equipped to handle the information? And if you can’t change one’s risk, how much of a service/disservice are you giving to patients [with the tests]?” asks Brian Bolwell, chair of Cleveland Clinic’s Taussig Cancer Institute. He adds that deciding how much testing is useful is a clinical challenge. While the boon in drugs based on DNA abnormalities is promising for patients, improving outcomes and reducing side effects, “a distinct minority of patients have their outcomes changed,” he says. Teaching cancer cells to behave (iStockPhoto) \nWe all have oncogenes in us, Bolwell says. Only in some people, however, do these cancer-causing genes reach their full potential as cancer cells. And while most treatments have focused on killing these cells, recent research has focused on changing the nature of cancer cells. “Can you in fact take a cancer cell and turn it from being malignant into something that doesn’t grow uncontrollably?” Bolwell asks. Encouraging trial data on this approach was presented last summer at the European Hematology Association conference.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T13:31:57.154+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
