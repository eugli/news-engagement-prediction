There are some terrific choices for restaurants in the Greater Phoenix area where you can go and take advantage of a Kids Eat Free program. Here are the ones I found. A few of them aren't exactly free, but they are pretty close! \nAll programs, details and prices subject to change without notice. Please call the restaurant in advance to verify the Kids Eat Free promotion requirements, including the hours available. I also have Kids Eat Free program information in a weekly planner format , if you are looking for these specials on a particular day of the week. Kids Eat Free (or Almost Free) in Greater Phoenix \n5 & Diner Kids age 12 and under can order a meal from the Kids Menu for $.99 (99 cents), one per each paid adult entree. Monday through Friday, all day long. Paradise Valley, Peoria and Mesa locations. The Surprise restaurant has the same offer, but only on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Scottsdale offers the deal only on Thursdays. The original Phoenix 5 & Diner does not participate.
