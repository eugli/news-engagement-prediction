With no samples in rotation, those in attendance were tasked with choosing the looks they felt embodied the brand’s spirit. Each of the attendees put their spin on the idea, but Laura Harrier pulled off the ultimate homage to Simons’s aesthetic. Donning a neon blazer, white blouse, and cropped navy trousers, the actress and model took a straightforward and eye-catching approach and her ensemble could have easily made its way into the Fall 2017 show—all that was missing was the clear PVC overlay. It’s far from the only great outfit Harrier has pulled out this week. She was seen heading to the Vogue 125th anniversary dinner in an equally alluring combination of hot pink Jil Sander blazer, Protagonist tank, and ripped jeans. In making the most of color and fit, Harrier and stylist Danielle Nachmani have created a fail-safe wardrobe that is chic without seeming overwrought, and their less-is-more approach feels like a breath of fresh air in the frenzy of New York Fashion Week.
