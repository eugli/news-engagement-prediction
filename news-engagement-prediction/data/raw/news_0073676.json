But we cannot progress — much less reconcile with ourselves and others — until we have confronted the past and understand both what happened and why it happened.\" \nIt was a powerful moment for Mr Chhang, who has forensically archived evidence of the Khmer Rouge's crimes through his organisation The Documentation Centre of Cambodia for more than two decades. \n\"Well you know you have to accept that there are two sides of all us and even in the most difficult situations there is also beauty in it,\" Mr Chhang said. \n\"Look at her today, 38 years later, which is closer to my own mother, I can't imagine a mother doing that to any child in the world.\" 'Bitter pill to swallow' \nMr Chhang's relationship with the perpetrators he has investigated for decades can be hard to comprehend, allowing for both reconciliation and the pursuit against of justice against some of them simultaneously. \nHe has stood beside his tormentor, talked to her at length and shared laughter with her but is still deeply rocked by the court's decision to drop charges against her, calling it \"a bitter pill to swallow\". \nThe court, formally known as the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, announced on Wednesday that Ms Chaem fell outside its scope of trying only the regime's senior leaders or those deemed most responsible for its crimes.

(DC-Cam: Leng Ratanak, file) \nThe hybrid UN/Cambodian court, which mandates all legal teams have national and international counterparts, has faced a litany of political and financial scandals since it was formulated in 2006 and has thus far only convicted three defendants. \nRecurring disputes have emerged between the international and national side of the prosecution team and investigative judges raising accusations that Cambodian lawyers have been pressured not to pursue certain suspects because of what their trials could reveal about members of the current regime. \nPrecisely this type of dispute has emerged again in the case of Ms Chaem. \nIn a statement outlining differences between its national and international sides, the office of the co-prosecutors revealed the extent to which the latter team believed she fell within the court's jurisdiction, arguing she had, among many other crimes, overseen a network of torturous security centres. \n\"Thousands of individuals were arbitrarily arrested, detained and executed in these and other locations under her responsibility,\" the statement read. \n\"Im Chaem also initiated construction at Spean Spreng dam and Prey Roneam reservoir and assigned many workers to Trapeang Thma dam. Thousands of individuals were forced to labour at these large irrigation projects and various other worksites under Im Chaem's responsibility in conditions amounting to enslavement.\" \nThe international co-prosecutor alleged she had committed crimes including murder, extermination, enslavement, imprisonment, torture, persecution, forced marriage, rape and enforced disappearances in roles assigned to her by the highest leaders of the regime. \nIn contrast, the national co-prosecutor deemed her not be one of the most responsible for the crimes of the Khmer Rouge and thus outside of the court's jurisdiction. \nDisputes like these represent one of several structural issues with the court that have slowed the judicial process at times to a crawl, exhausting the patience of many victims. 'Guilty as hell as far as I'm concerned' \nSeveral suspects, including the regime's leader Pol Pot, foreign minister Ieng Sary and Ta Mok, the notoriously brutal zone commander who built the school where Ms Chaem read, died either without being tried or before a verdict was reached. \nFor Cambodian-Australian filmmaker Chhorn Bunhom, who escaped a similar slave labour camp as a 6-year-old after witnessing unspeakable acts of violence, seeing another suspect escape trial is a stinging blow. \n\"So what have you got to do, kill half a million people to be guilty? She's guilty as hell as far as I'm concerned if she just killed one person. So what, I'm not senior enough to be killing?\" he said. \nMr Bunhom said he had long supported the trial but couldn't see the point in spending so much money if in the end the suspects such as Ms Chaem could just walk away and deny they did anything wrong. \n\"In that respect, what the court is basically saying to me, [Bun]Hom, is that it never happened. Basically what it's saying is that a genocide didn't happen. That is more hurtful to me. \n\"It probably makes her feel better at night but it's not convincing me that she's not guilty.\" \nBut where the court has frustrated him, Mr Bunhom has found other ways to come to terms with the trauma that was trust upon him and his family by the sadistic regime. \nIn 2014, he released his documentary Camp 32, in which he tracked down the site of his childhood internment after a remarkable series of reunions and more than a decade of searching.

I don't think survivors will be hit by this decision but rather make them stronger and realised they must stand on their own two feet and continue their journey for justice.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T07:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T05:51:51.802+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
