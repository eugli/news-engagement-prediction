No, disaster is a better word than bad!” said Guardiola sarcastically. “Yes, it’s possible we won’t qualify for the Champions League. Managers ranked as players \n“Today we are not in the Champions League positions. We’re going to see at the end of the season what my impression will be. Let us fight until the end. Let me try at least that. Fight.” \nH owever, Guardiola was more open when discussing the age profile of a squad with an abundance of players at either end of the experience spectrum but very few in the important age between 23 and 29, years that are often seen as the peak for professional athletes. \nOf the six first-team squad players who fit that profile, Fabian Delph is rarely used by Guardiola and Ilkay Gundogan was lost to long-term injury, leaving Sergio Agüero, Nicolas Otamendi, Kevin de Bruyne and Fernando as his only four such players.

I can understand for example how important Yaya [Touré) is now. And [Aleksandar] Kolarov. And how important it was with the personality of Pablo [Zabaleta] in the dressing room when he played, when we had injury problems, and he played against Barcelona. At the end, the heart and the soul of the team is the old players. The people who know the club.

First because every player costs £45-50 million, but it’s also not good to change seven, eight, nine players for seven, eight, nine players.” \nT his afternoon, City must overcome patchy form at the Etihad that has seen them win fewer home games than any of the top five clubs – indeed, their six home victories are three less than Lancashire rivals Burnley have managed. \nVictory at West Ham in midweek now means that City have collected two more points on their travels than they have at home, where Chelsea have won and Everton, Southampton, Middlesbrough and Tottenham all drew.

We won more points away than at home. On our pitch and home we will be stronger and that will happen because we dropped points, especially in the period with Everton and Middlesbrough and this kind of game. \n“But we were also unlucky in two important games against Chelsea and Tottenham. With those points we would be there. Away we are stable and we compete really good and win in many stadiums.” Watch | Guardiola's priceless reaction to Stan Collymore's criticism of Manchester City 00:24 \nS wansea's visit should also offer a first home start for new £27 million Brazilian forward Gabriel Jesus, who made a goalscoring full league debut at West Ham and who has already shown his manager that he has the necessary physical strength to thrive in England. \n“He’s a fighter,” said Guardiola. “The Brazilian guys are physical. People talk about the technical skills but I played with many Brazilians in Barcelona and I’ve managed many Brazilians and the biggest quality is how strong they are. \n“Fernandinho and Fernando are good examples of that. How strong their bodies are is amazing. So we didn’t have doubts about his physical approach. \n“He arrived and after one or two days he asked for a teacher to start to learn English. That counts for a lot. It means a lot to be involved because when people are talking on and off the pitch he can understand it and that’s a good sign for us.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T04:26:01.871+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
