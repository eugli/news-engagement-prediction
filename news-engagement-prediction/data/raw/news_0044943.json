February 21 is the deadline given by the Delhi government to schools to upload the names of all the applications accepted. \nParents can log on to the website of the schools where they have applied and check out the details. Schools such as The Mother’s International at Aurobindo Marg, Delhi Public School at Vasant Kunj, New Green Field at Saket and others have taken a lead and have already published the details. \nThough the government had given time till February 28, to upload the marks allotted to each applicant, some schools have also put out the marksheet. \nThe admission to nursery in Delhi is done on the basis of points alloted for criteria like neighbourhood, alumni, sibling, girl child and others. In situations where candidates secure same points, the schools will conduct a draw of lots.

And on March 7, the first list of selected candidates will be displayed. \nThe schools were this year asked to upload the details to ensure transparency. A senior official said, “If any school fails to comply with the directive action will be taken.” \nThis is, however, only for the general seats. For the Economically Weaker Section (EWS/DG) category the final list will be out on March 7 and will be released by the government. \nAround 1,50,000 aspirants vie for 1,25,000 seats every year , but the process gets caught in last-minute litigations as either parents or schools go to court almost every year. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T13:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:28:16.243+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
