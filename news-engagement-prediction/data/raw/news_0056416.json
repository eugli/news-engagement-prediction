Responding to a question about her personal life, the star said that she was focusing on her children, and described the breakup as a \"very difficult time,\" Daily Mail reports. \nJolie and Pitt had been together for 10 years, and have five children together, ranging in age from 8 to 15, according to The Independent. Jolie filed for divorce from Pitt in September, giving 'irreconcilable differences' as the reason for the split.   \n\"I donâ€™t want to say very much about that,\" Jolie said, \"except to say it was a very difficult time and we are a family, and we will always be a family.\" \n\"Many people find themselves in this situation,\" Jolie added. \"My whole family have all been through a difficult time.\" \n\"My focus is my children, our children,\" she went on to say. \"We are and forever will be a family and so that is how I am coping. I am coping with finding a way through to make sure that this somehow makes us stronger and closer.\" \nJolie was in Cambodia promoting the premiere of \"First They Killed My Father,\" a film she directed about Cambodian genocide under Pol Pot, based on a book of the same name by author Loung Ung, The Guardian reports. The couple adopted their eldest child, Maddox, 15, from Cambodia in 2002. \nKing Norodom Sihamoni, the monarch of Cambodia, attended the film's premiere. King Norodom has previously granted Jolie Cambodian citizenship for the work that she has done in the country. \nAnswering a question about where she sees herself in five years, Jolie said that she would like to travel the world, and has great hopes for her children's futures. \n\"I would like to be traveling around the world visiting my children, hoping that they're just happy and doing really interesting things and I imagine in many different parts of the world and I'll be supporting them,\" said the actress. \n\"Everything I do I hope ... I represent the right things to my children and give them the right sense of what they're capable of and the world as it should be seen,\" Jolie added. \"Not through the prism of Hollywood or through a certain kind of life but really take them into the world where they have a really good sense and become rounded people.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T21:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T09:01:21.241+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
