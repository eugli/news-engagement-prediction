We’re soulmates and I can’t wait to be Mrs Salvador – Charlie already calls me his missus and I’m proud to be his. \n“I don’t care whether it’s on a tropical beach, St Paul’s Cathedral or a high-security prison – I will marry the man I love. I will wear a white dress and we will vow to be together forever because that is the promise we have both made.

He says I have saved him, too. \n“To the rest of the world, he might be the most dangerous man alive, but we have a connection no one else will understand. But no one else needs to – it’s about us.” \nThe eccentric prisoner who has been twice married and three times engaged, went on to brag about how he saved up for the sparkler – even though he usually gets “knock off” versions. Romantic... Paula holds up a box with a picture of the couple on it ©MGM LTD (Photo: Adam Gerrard/Daily Mirror) \nThe dad-of-one’s first marriage was to Irene, mother of his son Mike in 1970. In 2001 he wed Saira Rehman in jail after she started writing to him having seen a photo of him in the paper, but the marriage lasted just two years. Then in 2015 he announced his engagement to Lorraine Etherington, another supporter, who was secretary of the Charles Bronson Art Foundation – set up to promote his prolific drawing hobby and raise money for charity. \nPaula – who was not even born when Bronson was first jailed for armed robbery in 1974 – told how the pair started exchanging letters while he was still with previous fiance Lorraine. \nThey did not meet until after the breakdown of that engagement. \nBut she revealed that they could not deny their connection after she read his book Broadmoor, about his experiences in the psychiatric institution.

I saw Broadmoor on the shelf and I saw Charlie’s face – my immediate reaction was ‘urgh, it’s that violent idiot’. \n“But I was fascinated by criminal psychology and mental health when I was at drama school and something made me buy the book. \n“As I read it, I realised we had so much in common. Of course, I had never been in a straitjacket or locked up and forced to eat like a dog, but I have been through dark times and I used humour to get through them just like he did. I knew he was with Lorraine so never considered a romantic relationship because I had huge respect for all she did to help him.

He has had a series of sentences added to his original term over the years for violent attacks on inmates and prison staff, along with more than a dozen hostage-taking incidents, gaining him the title of “Britain’s Most Dangerous Prisoner”. \nTo date he’s has served more than 43 years in prison and solitary confinement, spending just 122 days as a free man since his initial imprisonment.

He also tasted freedom in November, 1992, for 53 days, before inevitably returning to jail – this time for conspiracy to rob. He remains in solitary confinement for 22 hours a day. \nBut Paula said: “It’s the things that people don’t know about which make me love him. \n“Everyone reads the headlines about him taking hostages and being violent towards inmates or guards, but, to me, he is the most caring man. He writes to me to tell me how much he loves me and when I go to visit, he has the prison guards turn the radiator on half an hour before because he knows I feel the cold. (Photo: Adam Gerrard/Daily Mirror) \n“After everyone found out I was with him, I lost one of my acting jobs and Charlie felt so awful it was heartbreaking. Other people just don’t understand, but I see our future together in a quiet little stone cottage with dogs and maybe even children. We just want a normal life. \n“I never thought it would end up like this. I’m just a normal girl from a normal family. My mum worked as a lab technician in the local school and my dad was a postman. This isn’t what they wanted for me. \n“They will support me because they love me and they know I am happy, but they are really worried. \n“Of course, this is a bitter-sweet day for me, too. I would love to have got engaged to my partner in a nice restaurant and be having a glass of champagne. A phone call from a prison isn’t exactly how I imagined it.

The Charlie Bronson you have heard of is no more – this is the first step in his new life, too.” \nDuring the hour-long phone call, there was only one sign of Bronson’s “old self”. Speaking from the segregation unit of the high-security prison he joked about “warning off” another con to make sure he got to the phone first to make the life-changing call. \nBut his romantic side quickly took over once more as he described how he wants fish and chips on Great Yarmouth pier for their honeymoon – somewhere he used to go with his parents when he was a boy. \nOn Monday, Paula made one last visit to Charlie as a single woman.

We are deeply committed to one another and to our future together. \n“It’s not how I imagined it when I was a little girl, but I have never met anyone else who I wanted to spend the rest of my life with until now. I’m not giving up on that.” paula says her last visit to Bronson as a single woman was 'magical' ©MGM LTD (Photo: Adam Gerrard/Daily Mirror) She wore a revealing red dress and kissed the moustached convict through the metal bars of the visiting room ©MGM LTD (Photo: Adam Gerrard/Daily Mirror) Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:56:35.093+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
