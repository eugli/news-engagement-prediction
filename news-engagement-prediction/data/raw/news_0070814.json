But she has refuted the rumours. Fans’ excitement knew no bounds when her stylist Elizabeth Saltzman posted on her Instagram that the actress will soon be joining her in LA. There are reports of a success party being held for xXx: Return of Xander Cage, Deepika’s debut Hollywood venture. In her Instagram story, Saltzman welcomed a friend at an airport and captioned it saying “Oscar here we come” and gave rise to the rumour that Deepika might be attending this year’s ceremony. \nDeepika , who will soon leave for LA, was present at an event in Mumbai. On being questioned by a journalist if she indeed was going to be present at the Academy Awards ceremony, she denied the rumours. Ouch! That is a heartbreak for all of us.
