The key to his success was simple, yet revolutionary at the time: He insisted that his soldiers treat Iraqis with dignity and deference. He made keeping civilians safe and working to resolve local conflicts priorities over killing and detaining as many suspected insurgents as possible. “Every time you treat an Iraqi disrespectfully, you are working for the enemy,” he warned his troops. More recently, General McMaster has spoken of the threat of terrorism with nuance and restraint, careful not to brand all Muslims as a menace. That outlook is a welcome counterpoint to the hysteria that led the Trump administration to halt refugee resettlement and ban travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The White House said Mr. Trump has given General McMaster “full authority” to assemble his own team. It’s not clear, however, if General McMaster will be effective in a role that, in the best of cases, demands sharp political instincts, a president willing to absorb unpleasant news and the ability to build consensus among national security leaders. Having spent little time in Washington, General McMaster will have a steep learning curve on the basics. To spare him from interference, Mr. Trump should remove Steve Bannon, his chief strategist, from the National Security Council, which General McMaster will lead. Mr. Bannon was appointed to the Principals Committee of the council last month, while the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of national intelligence were taken off as regular members. Undoing this move would be a first step to forming a coherent national security team. While national security advisers generally do not need Senate confirmation, because General McMaster is a three-star general on active duty, the president must seek Senate approval to reassign him. This presents a valuable opportunity for lawmakers to question General McMaster about his worldview and his plans as he takes on the biggest challenge of his professional career. \nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter .
