To put this in perspective, one banana is 101g. It means we should all be piling up platefuls of greens and eating plenty of apples, strawberries, bananas etc.\n\nBut, getting this much greenery is not always easy, especially if you are not vegan or vegetarian. We want to hear from those of you who manage it without quitting meat. How do you do it? Whatâ€™s the impact? Do you have any advice for others who want to increase their veg and fruit intake?
