Not even close. A recent reveal of Mass Effect: Andromeda companion Jaal has got fans' hearts all a-flutter , as they quietly (or on sites like Twitter and Tumblr, not so quietly) pine for this sexy twi'lek… cat… squid… thing. \nBut really, this shouldn't be a surprise. Gamers have been fantasizing about fictional characters since Samus was little more than a collection of squares on our buzzing CRT televisions. What is surprising is how well BioWare seems to be embracing the idea. \"I am gunna bang that monocle rat lobster.\" I'm sorry, Dad. This is what I do for a living.

His drawing attention to the subject was decried as being a weak \"me too\" attempt and the message board was subsequently flooded by Overwatch art. VERY NSFW, but I have received reports that BattlebornRule34 is now a thing on Reddit. LINK WITH CAUTION: https://t.co/laA7tR4Dgs January 16, 2017 \nHowever BioWare chooses to proceed from here, one thing is clear: this is the age of appealing to a gamer's horniest sensibilities.
