I will also note that the seven countries that are listed in the executive order are the same seven countries that were already subject to other restrictions in obtaining visas that Congress put in place, both by naming countries, Syria and Iraq, and that the prior administration put in place by designating them as places where terrorism is likely to occur, or — the specific factors are whether the presence in a particular country increases the likelihood that an alien is a credible threat to U.S. security or an area that is a safe haven for terrorists.\" \nSubscribe today to get intelligence and analysis on defense and national security issues in your Inbox each weekday morning from veteran journalists Jamie McIntyre and Jacqueline Klimas.

Robart would have none of that. \n\"Well, let me walk you back, then,\" Robart said. \"You're from the Department of Justice, if I understand correctly?\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"So you're aware of law enforcement. How many arrests have there been of foreign nationals for those seven countries since 9/11?\" \n\"Your honor, I don't have that information. I'm from the civil division, if that helps get me off the hook.\" Also from the Washington Examiner", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T05:59:27.104+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
