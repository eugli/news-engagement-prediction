We now see more things unravelling, which indicates the matter requires a long-term solution. Everyone supports the fact that FAS need a new team of competent people who will drive the revamp efforts forward. \nTuanku Sultan and myself are concerned that the discussion of wholesome change will only be hot air instead of real progress. The Tuanku Sultan, with many years of wisdom being involved with FAS together with me ... wishes to see these changes. \nTuanku Sultan and myself see football as one of the biggest uniting factors for our community. When fans from all background, race and income group come to the stadium, it gives us great satisfaction. It is an integral time for FAS to repair their fracture and to realise the true potential of the organisation. \nThe upcoming EGM is a chance for them to do the brave and honourable decision and facilitate this transition so that the breakthrough will be achieved sooner rather than later.” \nThe president does not hold the position longer than two terms (each term 4 years). The president cannot be involved in politics and is not a public nuisance; \nThe president must appoint four senior exco members and the secretary. The position must not be held by the same person for more than two terms consecutively; \nThe exco appointed at the EGM must consists of at least 60% new faces. The exco must give their full commitment and dedication. Should set performance indicators and be prepared to work tirelessly; \nTo revise the FAS statute. This includes providing executive powers to the president, having maximum terms in office, portfolio of the committees to be effective and bring positive developments towards football in the state; \nTransparency amongst affiliate members. Affiliate clubs under FAS should be active in order to vote. Affiliates to be more involved in development programmes and submit regular reports to FAS. The process needs to be transparent; \nFinancial sustainability. The entire leadership in FAS needs to take responsibility and accountability for the organisation to be financially sustainable in the near future and not continuously rely on state government funding; and \nFocus more on development work. FAS should leverage on the affiliate clubs, community football competitions and other related bodies from the private and public sector in contributing to the development of grassroots, junior and youth football programmes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T03:39:21.847+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
