Acting Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said, \"gang members are increasingly using financial fraud to pay for their lifestyle.\" (Barry Williams/for New York Daily News) \nBetween June 2014 and March 2016, they recruited people to open new accounts or provided information from existing accounts at Bank of America, TD Bank, Capital One and JP Morgan Chase. \nThe gang members then deposited the bogus checks and quickly withdrew the funds, prosecutors said. \n“We will continue to investigate and prosecute this facet of gang activity to get dangerous individuals off the streets and make sure stolen money isn’t used to fund violent acts,” said Gonzalez. \nIf convicted, the men face up to seven years in prison.
