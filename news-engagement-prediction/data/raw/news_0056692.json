Article continues below What caused an angry reaction from Antoine Greizmann's vs Bayer Leverkusen \n“You have to ask him. Of course, I can’t guarantee. I cannot guarantee that I’m here next week, how can I guarantee that a player is here next season?” said Mourinho, ahead of United's Europa League last-32 second leg away to Saint-Etienne on Wednesday. \nUnited's executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has already given the greenlight to Rooney's agent, Paul Stretford, to go in search for the striker's next club and it appears Mourinho's uncertainties over Rooney's future are likely based off some inside knowledge. \nTianjin Quanjian boss and former Italy legend Fabio Cannavaro has admitted that his club, who are newly-promoted into the CSL this season, have held talks with Rooney but has revealed why his side are no longer interested in pursuing his signature. Tianjin reject Rooney purchase \n“We did make an approach for Rooney, but it was just a chat because he simply doesn’t suit our style of play,\" Cannavaro admitted, per the Mirror . \n“No further discussion was necessary.\" \nTianjin have already taken the likes of Axel Witsel and Alexandre Pato to China, but while the big spenders may have snubbed Rooney, Shanghai SIPG and Beijing Guoan are two potential suitors for England's all-time top scorer. \nThe Beijing outfit considered a £20 million bid last month, but there remains time for them to snap up Rooney, despite the Red Devils having previously preferred to sell their frontman in the summer when Antoine Griezmann is expected to arrive from Atletico Madrid. United ready to sell \nHowever, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic in red-hot form at Old Trafford, plus Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial higher up the pecking order than their ageing captain, they feel they can afford to let Rooney leave prior to the end of the season. \nBut Sunday's EFL Cup final against Southampton at Wembley could be a big indicator whether Rooney will still be at Old Trafford in a week's time, with it reported his move to China could hinge on whether he makes Mourinho's squad for the final or not. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
