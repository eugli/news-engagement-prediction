The 27-inch monitor ran into a number of issues if it was placed within two meters of a router, making the display flicker, disconnect, or freeze computers due to electromagnetic interference. In a statement to Recode , LG says it’s planning to redesign the displays. \n“LG apologizes for this inconvenience and is committed to delivering the best quality products possible so all LG UltraFine 27-inch 5K displays manufactured after February 2017 will be fitted with enhanced shielding,” says an LG spokesperson.\nRecode claims that existing models will be able to be “retrofitted” with the enhanced shielding, allowing the monitor to be placed near a router. It’s unlikely that LG will recall existing UltraFine 5K Display units, and the company appears to be opting to carry out repairs on a case-by-case basis. LG is currently recommending affected users \"contact their nearest LG customer center for prompt service\". Apple and LG unveiled the 5K display back in October, promising that it’s designed to work well with the new MacBook Pro.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T12:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T13:28:13.592+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
