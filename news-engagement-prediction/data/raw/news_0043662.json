He did not return messages from the Free Press seeking comment. \nA former state representative, Young is term-limited in the Michigan Senate in 2018. \nRelated news: Lansing’s Virg Bernero to seek 4th term as mayor \nHis late father, Coleman Young, was Detroit's first black mayor and one of its most influential — and controversial — leaders. He was also the city's longest serving mayor, his term running from 1974-1994. \nLast fall, Coleman Young II, a Democrat from Detroit, told the Free Press he hadn't made any decisions about seeking another public office. \n\"I'm going to keep my options open,\" he said at the time. \nAlexis Wiley, chief of staff to Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, said the mayor was not surprised by Young's announcement. Duggan announced earlier this month that he's seeking re-election. \n\"The mayor’s expected it for a long while, that he was going to be running,\" Wiley said Sunday night. \"And we expect that he won’t be the only person who gets into the race between now and the filing deadline.\" \nThe filing deadline is April 25. The primary will be held Aug. 8; the election is Nov 7. \nContact staff writer Ann Zaniewski at 313-222-6594 or azaniewski@freepress.com.
