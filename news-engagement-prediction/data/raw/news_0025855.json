Now we have to build on that and keep going. 'We have fantastic quality in the team, great mentality and great character, but it is no good me saying that it is up to us to show that from now until the end of the season.' The way Liverpool had faltered, particularly when they lost 2-0 at Hull 10 days ago, had raised questions about the squad's mental strength and resilience. Henderson could see why the issue was raised. Henderson helped Liverpool beat Tottenham 2-0 at the weekend 'You have to stick together,' said Henderson. 'It was a tough time because we knew we hadn't won for so long and performance levels were not up to standard. But you have to stay together and keep believing and I felt we did that. 'I wouldn't question the attitude of the players, it is very good. But there are one or two things we need to work on which we did last week in training which could help us going forward.' Perhaps the most significant aspect of the Tottenham performance was the way Sadio Mane, Philippe Coutinho and Roberto Firmino started to gel again and Henderson hopes it is a sign that the trio are ready to return to the blistering form of last autumn. Henderson knows the players have let the fans down at the start of the year Mane had looked to have recovered from his exertions at the Africa Cup of Nations and Henderson believes he holds the key as to whether Liverpool can secure a place in the Champions League next season. 'It was definitely positive,' said Henderson. 'The most pleasing thing was second half we were solid, focused, took the sting out of the game and did a lot of good things without the ball. Overall I felt we defended well as a team and attacked well as a team. 'They couldn't live with Sadio's pace in behind. We had a good week's training leading in and I thought we put everything we had worked on in training into the game and it worked perfectly.'
