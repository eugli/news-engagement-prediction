Credit Barbara Statas/Smithsonian’s National Zoo She had her fun and, it appears, she was ready to come home. After a brief flirtation with freedom, Ollie, a 6-year-old bobcat living at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo in Washington, was found on Wednesday near the zoo’s birdhouse, officials said. Though they could not retrace the 25-pound bobcat’s nearly two-day adventure, officials said she might have left the property but most likely never strayed more than two miles from the zoo. “We’re just over-the-moon happy,” Craig Saffoe, the zoo’s curator of great cats, said at an evening news conference.

(She had become “a symbol of freedom and one of its last hopes in a world gone rotten,” The Washingtonian proclaimed on Wednesday night.) But for zoo officials, her capture, thanks to a tip from a visitor who spotted her crossing a walkway, offered relief. After receiving the tip, staff members at the birdhouse notified Mr. Saffoe and his colleagues, who set up live traps in the area of the sighting. “Within 15 minutes, the birdhouse keepers called us back and told us, ‘We have a bobcat in a trap up here,’” he said.
