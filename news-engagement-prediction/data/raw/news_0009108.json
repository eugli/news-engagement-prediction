But Coach Belichick has always been there. So to definitively say who’s more responsible, it’s really hard to say because they’ve always been together.” \nWhen pressed, however, Sharpe said he gives the nod to Belichick, who is 201-71 in the regular season and 24-9 in the playoffs with New England and also serves as the Patriots’ de facto general manager.

And he’s done a great job of surrounding Tom Brady. \n“I know people seem to think that if it’s not Julio (Jones), it’s not Ezekiel Elliot, they’re not football players,” Sharpe continued. “But when you think about it, there’s only 1,700 people who do what (NFL players) do in the entire world, out of 7 billion people. So although they’re not those guys, they’re very, very good players. They’re still at the top of the entire world.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T22:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T04:19:42.439+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
