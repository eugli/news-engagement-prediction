Security Council resolution endorsing the pact.\nIran has test-fired several ballistic missiles since the nuclear deal in 2015, but the latest test was the first since Trump entered the White House. Trump said during his election campaign that he would stop Iran's missile programme.\nThe United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on Tuesday and recommended the missile testing be studied at committee level. The new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, called the test \"unacceptable\".\nThe Security Council resolution was adopted to buttress the deal under which Iran curbed its nuclear activities to allay concerns they could be used to develop atomic bombs, in exchange for relief from economic sanctions.\nThe resolution urged Tehran to refrain from work on ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons. Critics say the resolution's language does not make this obligatory.\nTehran says it has not carried out any work on missiles specifically designed to carry nuclear payloads.\n(Reporting by Bozorgmehr Sharafedin; Editing by Alexander Smith)\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T16:22:50.593+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
