The video was posted on Facebook and distributed widely. \nAnd in a recent vandalism attack, \"West Papua\" was written on the grass verge in front of the Indonesian Embassy in Canberra using weedkiller. \nWest Papuan independence is an extremely sensitive issue in Indonesia. \nMany Indonesians remain suspicious of Australia's intentions in Papua, even though it has signed the Lombok Treaty recognising Indonesian sovereignty over the restive province. \nTrade Minister Steve Ciobo, left, visits a Coca-Cola plant in West Java, Indonesia, in December.
