This year’s festival, which runs from May 1-7 in New York, will feature 150 writers in a series of talks, readings and workshops related to social justice, sexuality and politics.

Other highlights include a talk about cultural identity with the National Book Award-winning novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and Trevor Noah, of “The Daily Show.” And the reading “Literary Quest: Tenement Museum Edition” will feature the artist Laurie Anderson and the writers Teju Cole, Jennifer Egan and more, drawing inspiration from the museum’s history of New York’s immigrants.
