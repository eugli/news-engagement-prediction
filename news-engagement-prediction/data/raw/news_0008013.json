A story from MLive.com documents Khaleefah's life , which began in Iraq. It was there that Khaleefah grew up in a war-torn country before his family immigrated to the United States when he was about nine years old. \nKhaleefah says that he saw his uncle, friends and neighbors shot in Iraqui streets. His family decided to move to the United States because \"we couldn't just afford to lose any more family members than we did.\" \nWhen he arrived in America, he didn't speak any English, making his transition to life here more difficult, but it seems there's one universal language among teenagers all over the world: video games. \nKhaleefah had no familiarity with the sport of football, and he became acquainted with it while playing \"Madden.\" He played the game in middle school and learned all about football, but it wasn't until his sophomore year of high school that he actually put on pads and played the game when others convinced him to give it a try. \nIt's an interesting story, and one I recommend reading in its entirety . \nAs for how Khaleefah's football career will turn out, given where his journey began, the fact he's received a scholarship to play at Michigan State already feels like a tremendous victory.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T23:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T19:03:17.907+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
