Adam Silver, Michael Jordan (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 4:52 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 4:52 p.m. ET \nThe NBA has heard enough about the ongoing spat between Charles Oakley and Knicks owner James Dolan and will attempt to reconcile their differences, according to the New York Post . \nThe league office is considering having NBA commissioner Adam Silver and Michael Jordan join Oakley and Dolan on a conference call either Monday or Tuesday, the report said, citing an unnamed source. \nMORE: Spike Lee criticizes James Dolan while wearing Charles Oakley jersey \nJordan, the owner of the Hornets, is one of Oakley's former teammates and friends who wants to see the spat come to an end. \nDolan and the Knicks have engaged in bizarre back-and-forth finger pointing since Oakley's arrest Wednesday, releasing a series of statements pleading for Oakley to \"get some help soon\" and painting him as the aggressor who started the scuffled last week. Dolan insinuated Friday that Oakley is an alcoholic, which Oakley denied. \nThe Knicks owner said Oakley is banned from stepping foot inside Madison Square Garden as a result of the altercation, which has owned headlines across the NBA and added yet another ring to New York's circus this season.
