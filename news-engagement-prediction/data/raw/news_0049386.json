We are going round now and any teacher found wanting in the discharge of he or her duties will be sacked so they can create chance for serious and dedicated people.” \nHe further charged the teachers to collaborate with School Based Management Committees in order to check the incident of vandalism in public schools, adding that “we must all protect this beautiful edifice that the state government built for learning.” Okogba ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T09:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T04:27:32.435+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
