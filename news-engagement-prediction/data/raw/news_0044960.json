During a solo number in her final night in the show, the former Spice Girl couldn't help channeling Scary Spice by singing a little \"Wannabe.\" \n\"I'm gonna tell you something...\" Mel B begins, then busting into \"so here's the story from A to Z.\" Not surprisingly, the crowd went crazy for the throwback moment. A post shared by Mel B (@officialmelb) on Feb 20, 2017 at 10:10am PST \nMel B had the Spice Girl vibes before even taking the stage for her final Chicago performance, as she shared a picture from her Scary Spice days with the caption \"Me walking off broadway last night at my last show.\" Even after the performance, her ode to Scary continued with her daughter Madison, who clearly wants to take after her mom. A post shared by Mel B (@officialmelb) on Feb 20, 2017 at 1:28pm PST \nMel B's Chicago run lasted from Dec. 28 through Feb. 19 at New York's Ambassador Theater. In addition to her Spice Girls shout-out, she gave a shout-out to herself on Twitter for not missing a single performance during her eight-week Broadway stint. \nWhether Mel B will continue to appear in Broadway shows is unclear, but after her Scary Spice tease, she likely has fans hoping for a Spice Girls musical -- wouldn't that be a way to celebrate their 20th anniversary?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:14:59.600+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
