Sweden. Image: Eric Risberg/AP/REX/Shutterstock By Marcus Gilmer 2017-02-21 17:38:28 UTC \nInfoWars editor-at-large and alt-right conspiracy theorist Paul Joseph Watson is fulfilling a promise he made on Twitter, to pay a journalist to go scope out a Swedish suburb he calls \"crime ridden.\" SEE ALSO: Internet turns to @Sweden after Trump appears to invent terror attack \nWatson took to Twitter on Monday to lambast critics who ridiculed President Donald Trump's strange reference to Sweden during a rally on Saturday. During the speech, Trump made a baffling reference to Sweden that seemed to imply the country had been hit by a terrorist attack, which it had not. \"You look at what’s happening in Germany, you look at what’s happening last night in Sweden,\" he said. \nAs expected, the people of the internet had a field day mocking the president over these claims. It was later learned that Trump was referring to a Fox News piece that made claims about rising immigrant violence in the typically peaceful country. \nDefending Trump, Watson claimed such violence in the Swedish city of Malmo was real and offered up a donation to any journalist willing to make the trip and investigate the allegations. Any journalist claiming Sweden is safe; I will pay for travel costs & accommodation for you to stay in crime ridden migrant suburbs of Malmo \n— Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) February 20, 2017 \nEnter video journalist Tim Pool, who's done plenty of on-the-ground reporting and live-streams, including from the 2014 Ferguson, Missouri riots. Count me in Paul. Let me know how we can arrange this. https://t.co/XeD3ZhKD6J \n— Tim Pool (@Timcast) February 20, 2017 \nWatson made good on the offer and donated $2,000 to Pool, which the journalist used to start a GoFundMe campaign . He hopes to raise $20,000 to fund the project, which he says will include daily updates, live-streams, and, after the trip, a documentary, Last Night in Sweden , about what he finds. \nSpeaking to Huffington Post UK , Pool said that in discussions with Watson after the donation, he admitted he had recently visited the city and \"found it quite boring.\" \nHe continued, “No offense to Malmo, I don’t mean the city was bad. Just me and my friends walked around, ate ice cream and nothing happened.\" It will be interesting to watch if Pool finds more than ice cream in Malmo on this assignment. \nMuch hay has been made about both Watson's Twitter claims as well as the Fox News segment that inspired Trump, which included an interview with documentarian Ami Horowitz and a clip from his film Stockholm Syndrome . A New York Times report says that statistics don't back claims made in the documentary clip that there was an increase in crime, even with more migrants coming in to the country from 2015 to 2016. \nSwedish media have also taken to debunking the film , though Fox itself stands by the story. \nMeanwhile, two police, whose experiences play a key part in the documentary, have since claimed that the filmmaker, Ami Horowitz, edited the footage and that they were never told it was specifically about violence by migrants; Horowitz has denied their claim. \nFeeding into Watson's claims, riots broke out Monday night in a predominantly immigrant Stockholm suburb after officers arrested a suspect on drug charges. Rioters wearing masks, threw rocks at police, set cars on fire and looted shops in Rinkeby. \nSwedish police spokesman Lars Bystrom said, \"This kind of situation doesn't happen that often but it is always regrettable when they happen.\" \nRegardless of statistics or who you believe in this case, it looks like we'll get a close-up look at the controversy courtesy of Pool and, in a smaller way, InfoWars. \nAdditional reporting by the Associated Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:49:55.663+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
