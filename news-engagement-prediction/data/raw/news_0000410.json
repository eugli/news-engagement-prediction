Romo was the Giants' primary closer in 2013 and '14, when he recorded a combined 61 saves. He pitched well in a setup role in '15 and '16, compiling a 2.64 ERA last season, while limited to 40 appearances because of a forearm flexor strain. \nRomo, who turns 34 next month, would seem to have the inside track to replace setup man Joe Blanton , who also is a free agent. The slider specialist has more late-inning experience than Pedro Baez , Josh Ravin and Chris Hatcher , the right-handed trio figured to vie for the job had there not been a late acquisition.

He also is the second former Giants closer the Dodgers have signed in recent years, following Brian Wilson. Ken Gurnick has covered the Dodgers since 1989, and for MLB.com since 2001.
