Mesut Ozil suffering CRISIS of confidence, admits Arsenal boss Wenger \nReports suggest a section of Arsenal’s squad have grown frustrated with Arsene Wenger’s persistent selection of the midfielder and it appears Neville sympathises with them. \n‘The first person I’d take out of the team would be Mesut Ozil,’ the former Red Devil said on Football Today. \n‘You cannot win a league title with him in the team, playing like he has done in the big games since he’s come to the Premier League. You just can’t.’ Phil Neville has called for Mesut Ozil to be dropped (Picture: Getty) \nWenger came out in support of Ozil ahead of Arsenal’s clash with Hull at the Emirates. \n‘The team wins and the team loses. When you win sometimes some players are singled out as they are treated like exceptional players, but when you don’t do well sometimes just focus a little bit more on the team aspect and not try to blame each other,’ he said.
