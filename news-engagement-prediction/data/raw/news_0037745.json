He ran into the burning home. \n“I went back inside, tried to get more people and I just couldn’t get through the flames and the smoke,” \nThe 19-year-old wished he could have saved more people. \n“I want to feel good that I got her, but I feel bad that her family had to go,” Teague told CTV Toronto. “And that’s horrible.” \nAt the burned-out house on Wednesday, neighbours struggled to come to grips with the loss. \n“Small child like that, no parents, no sister,” said neighbour Tom Sampson. “I wouldn’t wish that on anybody. We’re all human, you know? I just don’t like to see this stuff, I get upset.” \nOfficials say the fire started in the living room of the house and spread quickly. The cause was still unknown on Wednesday.
