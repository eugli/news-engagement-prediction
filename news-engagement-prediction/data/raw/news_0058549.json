He poured in 17 points in the final frame to help the Riverhawks take two of three from the Eagles in Columbia River Conference play. The win puts The Dalles in a good position to claim the No. 3 seed and final play-in round spot with Hood River Valley's two remaining league games against top teams Pendleton and Hermiston. \nIt was the final CRC game for The Dalles (5-15, 2-7 CRC), and Thursday they host Crook County. The Dalles ends the regular season on the road Friday against Ridgeview in Redmond. \nMurr joins Wilsonville's Zach Reichle and Parkrose's Isaac Bonton as Class 5A players to score more than 50 points in a game this season. Reichle scored 56 points against Milwaukie on Jan. 31, and Bonton netted 52 points Feb. 14. \nOverall, Murr is the fourth Oregon high school player to score more than 50 points in a game this season. Jefferson's Geno West scored 53 points on Feb. 14 -- the same night Bonton did his work.
