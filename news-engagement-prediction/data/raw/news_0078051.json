This exquisite coming-of-age tale about a black boy struggling to embrace queer masculinity deserved all the shine it got this year, including three trophies last night. But Academy officials sullied Moonlight 's moment in the sun by initially giving the award to the wrong film , La La Land. It remains unclear how the award's announcers, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway, ended up with a duplicate copy of the card for Best Actress in a Leading Role , an award which went to Emma Stone. But in the middle of the La La Land team giving their round of acceptance speeches, they were told that the award had actually gone to Moonlight , and that team was then invited on stage as an afterthought. In the shuffle, host Jimmy Kimmel tried to assuage the clear disappointment of the La La Land 'ers saying, \"I think you guys should keep it anyway.\" That's not how this works, Jimmy Kimmel. That's not how any of this works! It is both entirely obvious and absolutely necessary to say that this incident is an apt metaphor for thinking about the politics of race and diversity in America. It has taken multiple decades of struggle to even arrive at a universe where a movie with the emotional and artistic complexity of Moonlight, a moviethat puts black characters and communities at its center,would have a shot at multiple Oscars. Then it won the evening's biggest prize of all, but only after being told it lost. And then the film's creators had to share the stage with La La Land . The moment was unfortunate for everyone involved, but it was most unfortunate for Moonlight.", "external_links": ["http://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/a8983756/breakdown-oscars-mix-up-best-picture-moonlight-la-la-land/", "http://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/movies/a8983700/oscars-wrong-winner-best-picture-la-la-land-moonlight-2017/"], "published": "2017-02-28T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:46:03.795+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
