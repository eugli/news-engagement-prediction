According to the law, the minimum age for the marriage of females is 18 and for males it is 21, other than the 'exceptions in special circumstances'.\nOn Monday, the Child Marriage Restraint Bill 2017 was passed in voice vote to Child Marriage Restraint Act 2017 when State Minister for Women and Children Affairs Meher Afroz Chumki placed it before the MPs. \nBefore it was pushed through, the corrections proposed by the MPs of the Opposition, the Jatiya Party, were overruled in voice vote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T01:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T15:13:31.190+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
