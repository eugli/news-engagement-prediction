He is not welcome, the family hate him. Heaven help him if he turned up. \nTWITTER FURY: Fadi took to twitter in an all-cap rant \n“Fadi was not really his boyfriend. No one has spoken to him and he just seems to be getting on with his life. It makes my stomach turn.” \nThey were apparently incensed after Fadi claimed that George killed himself in a bizarre series of Twitter posts following his death on Christmas Day. \nPolice are treating his death as “unexplained” which has led to increasing speculation the singer, who had a well-documented battle with hard drugs, could have died as a result of a relapse.
