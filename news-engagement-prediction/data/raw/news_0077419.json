Better get that Oscars polish ready for 2018, Katie. \nWith London-central filming, Tom Daley is among the other strange cameos in the fifth film, slipping on his tiny speedos and diving in against the weather-worn sharks. As for Price, the page-three girl-cum-reality star-cum-mother, is best known for her marriage to '90s popstar Peter Andre and that time she dressed as a unicorn for a photoshoot.

London won't be the only city in the film's sights, promising that other countries affected will be Australia and (of all places) Bulgaria. Watch out, Kyle, you'll be next. Other Big Brother alumni Jedward featured in both the third and fourth entries of the film, so we can easily see them teaming up alongside Katie — I mean, why the hell not? There is no word on how big a part Price will play, or if she will make it out of the aquatic apocalypse alive, but if all else fails and London floods, at least her assets would help her keep her afloat. \nCheck out the trailer for Sharknado 4 , and don't forget our poll below!
