Yet some Democrats refused to acknowledge them … until Trump forced them to on Election Day. \nYet, it is amazing how quickly the tables have turned. \nThe day after the inauguration, historic numbers of women traveled to Washington, D.C., to protest. Thousands more filled Lake Eola park the same day. And this week, hundreds flocked to Orlando International Airport to protest Trump's immigration policies. \nIf Republicans dismiss or downplay all that, they would be as foolish as Democrats were last fall. \nAnd yet ... cue the fools. \n\"What a waste of time,\" posted one commenter on orlandosentinel.com's story about the Eola rallies. \"Marches are meaningless. Support your new president. Get over it.\" \nAnother suggested the women worried about abortion simply keep their \"legs closed,\" while another opined: \"I wish these sweet girls wouldn't worry their sweet little minds about things like this.\" \nAdmittedly, online forums are the place where sense, civility and basic decency go to die. But the comments echo the dismissive attitude of top Republicans and Trump supporters. \nRush Limbaugh described the women's marches as a \"temper tantrum.\" Rudy Giuliani suggested many of the protesters didn't even know what they were protesting. And Trump spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway claimed to be befuddled by the whole affair, saying: \"I frankly didn't see the point.\" \nWell, Kellyanne, allow 74-year-old Barbara Hill of Eustis to explain it to you. \nHill is a grandmother of 14, a retired lawyer and full-time volunteer. And she is ticked off in a way she can't remember. She's worried about women's rights, mad about the way refugees and Muslims are being treated, and concerned about international relations. She felt compelled to travel to Washington to make her voice heard. \n\"I will tell you that Donald Trump succeeded in waking the sleeping giant,\" she said. \"We are people who want justice for everyone and to have a voice. The march was not the end, but just the beginning.\" \nAs I thought about all the protests and rallies I've covered around Orlando through the years, from the left and the right, I came to a simple conclusion: These people should not be ignored ... because they often win. \nIn 2008, Republicans dismissed Barack Obama 's packed stadiums as temporary celebrity appeal … until Democrats won the White House and Congress. \nOne year later, Republicans and Tea Partiers packed health care town halls. I sat in acrowdedroom where people fussed at Alan Grayson in Orlando. Democrats rolled their eyes … and then got shellacked at the polls in 2010. \nIn 2011, it was Occupy Wall Street . I spoke with protesters who marched down Orange Avenue as Republicans dismissed the marchers as millennials who didn't understand the real world … until those millennials helped re-elect Obama and give Democrats gains in Congress again. \nThen last year, it was the Republicans' turn. Democrats rolled their eyes at massive Trump rallies at UCF and elsewhere ... until those protesters ended Dems' premature celebration of America's first female president. \nHistory shows that some of these swings are simply natural. They represent the electoral pendulum that swings back and forth as voters try to find a balance of power. \nBut the protests have also proven to be reliable indicators of change. And the Republicans dismissing and condescending to those rallying now are as foolish as the Democrats who did the same thing just a few short months ago. \n\"I want this country to succeed,\" Hill said. \"There are many of us. We are legion. And we will march again.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T05:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:45:08.075+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
