What is Energy Exactly? And, How Can it Heal? \nIn this article we explore healing and different kinds of energy work . Webster’s Dictionary describes Energy as “a vigorous exertion of power” okay, but how does it work? How Energy Works \nIf we go to Quantum Physics, we find that the concept of Energy gets to be quite complicated. Einstein showed us that E=MC, Energy equals Mass times the speed of Light squared. This tells us that Mass and Energy are interchangeable. Also, that both space and time are not absolute. The most important consequence of this is that Mass is nothing but a form of Energy. So, everything is a form of Energy, objects at rest have stored Energy. Trees, Rocks, Dogs, Water, and People are all made up of Energy, in one form or another. \nThis means that Energy can exist as either solid matter or as non-solid matter, such as a beam of light. radio waves, microwaves and x-rays are all forms of pure non-solid Energy. Where Does Energy Come From? \nEnergy is all around us, everywhere in all different wavelengths and frequencies. From energies with very short wavelengths like Cosmic Radiation and x-rays to very long wave lengths such as radio waves and Infra-red waves. \nEveryday our bodies are being hit with these energies from many different sources. We don’t see it but we know it is there. \nWhen we speak, our voice saying words has released sound waves of Energy causing ripples in the air around us. When we think, our brains release wavelengths of Energy. Can Energy Be Measured? \nTo the scientific community, Energy is something measurable with specific instruments to detect for example, heat, light, or cosmic radiation. The Energy used in healing is equally real, with the measuring device being that exquisitely sensitive one, the human body. Our bodies are receiving stations for Energy and also transmitters of Energy. About Our Multi-Body System \nWe are made up of a multi-body system, not just the physical body. We have an etheric body, an emotional body, a mental body, and an astral body (see: Five layers of the Human Energy Field ). Things don’t just affect us physically. We are affected on multiple levels. When we think thoughts, these non-solid forms of Energy go out into our multi-system body and greatly affect us. Healing Balances Energy \nWe all have storage centers in our bodies that house Energy and Energy patterns. These centers are called chakras . We can have energy patterns stored from events that happened yesterday as well as from many years ago. Some of these patterns will be happy memories and others will be unpleasant or painful memories of something that happened to us. Sometimes we stash them away deep into some recess in our chakras and in our auras (the energy field around us). We try to forget about painful memories, but they don’t really go away. Dis-ease is a manifestation of unbalanced Energy. Healing is a way of balancing Energy. Negative Forms of Energy \nThroughout our lives we pick up negative forms of Energy, such as Fear, Doubt, Anger, Worry , Judgment, Criticism , Blame and others. Any techniques we find that enable us to let go of these patterns will help to move us toward peace and happiness. Pathways to Balancing Your Energy \nThere are many ways to balance your Energy. \nOne approach is a path of love... \nT o become the most complete and loving being you can be. The loving Energy will naturally dissolve the parts of you that are keeping you unbalanced. \nAnother way of balancing your Energy is via recognition, surrender, and release. \nRecognition—recognizing the problem. Followed by Surrender and Release—putting trust in the highest power, letting go of trying to control how your life will manifest. It is releasing how we think things should be, and knowing that he Divine Source will take control. \nIf you combine both approaches (path of Love and the path of Release) you will have the fastest way possible to creating a balanced, healed state of being. \nWhen a trained energyworker works with you to help balance your Energy, for many, the process of Healing is accelerated. \nArticle edited by Phylameana lila Desy May 13, 2016", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:28:29.889+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
