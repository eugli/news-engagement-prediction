By Jeremy C. Fox and Aimee Ortiz Globe Correspondent and Globe Staff February 26, 2017 \nSTONEHAM — A 16-year-old girl was killed when the SUV she was driving crashed here early Sunday morning, according to State Police. \nThe victim was Sydney Coiro, an honor student at Stoneham High School, according to her grandmother, Patty Coiro, 59, of Revere. Advertisement \nState Police did not release her identity because she was a juvenile, according to Dave Procopio, a State Police spokesman. \nThe teen, who lived in Stoneham, was alone in a 2000 Ford Explorer, which was found around 12:45 a.m. overturned on Pond Street State Police said in a statement. She was pronounced dead at the scene. Get Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here \nStoneham police said the teen crashed on a mile-long stretch of Pond Street in the Middlesex Fells. They referred other questions to State Police, who are leading the investigation. \nPatty Coiro said her granddaughter had dropped off friends and was heading home at the time of the crash. The family believes it was a “freak accident” that was likely caused by roads slick from Saturday night’s rain, Patty Coiro said. \n“She was a very conscientious driver,” she added. “We did not expect that this would ever happen.” Advertisement \nSydney Coiro had one older sister, who lives in Seattle, and she worked at Bear Hill Rehabilitation and Nursing Center in Stoneham, according to her grandmother. \n“She had dreams and aspirations of becoming a nurse, and she was an excellent musician,” Patty Coiro said by phone, as her voice broke. “She was a compassionate, loving, very beautiful soul. And our loss is tremendous. She was very well loved.” Handout. \nSydney Coiro. \nAt the scene of the crash, near the back of the Stoneham Zoo parking lot, balloons and flowers were wrapped around a tree, along with a photo of Sydney Coiro and three other girls. \nStanding beside the memorial on Sunday afternoon, Janice Landry, a Stoneham resident and mother of one of Sydney Coiro’s classmates, said she learned about the crash from her daughter, who had driven past the scene. \nIn the morning, she received a robocall telling her the news. \n“I’m upset. I’m feeling the same grief,” Landry said. \nLandry said her son took driver’s education with Coiro in November 2016. She said the section of road where the crash took place is dangerous because of its many curves. \nEddy Moreira, 18, of Woburn, said his cousin was good friends with Sydney Coiro and had been with her and a third friend Saturday night on a trip to Boston before the crash. He said he had spoken to the girls on FaceTime while they were out. Reached by phone, his cousin declined an interview. \nMoreira said he had worked with Sydney Coiro in the kitchen at the rehabilitation center for more than a year and that she had an infectious sense of humor. \n“She was very funny,” he said. “She would always pop jokes or say something funny after someone said something. She was always laughing and joking around with everyone.” \nMoreira said Sydney Coiro had gotten to know the residents at the facility and their medical conditions, and would go out of her way to give them special treats within the bounds of their dietary restrictions. \n“A lot of the residents were really thankful for everything she did,” he said. \nHe said he hopes to create some kind of tribute to her at the rehabilitation facility, “just to live with her memory and show the impact she had on everyone.” \nMoreira said Sydney Coiro’s favorite musician was the rapper Mac Miller, and he will think of her anytime he hears Miller’s music. He considered her “a true friend,” he said. \n“Me and Sydney were kind of close, so it’s like wow, it’s really hitting me,” he said of the loss. “She’ll be missed. ... A father lost a daughter, a mother lost a daughter … but we also lost a good friend.” \nAndrew O’Neil, 18, a former co-worker at the facility, also recalled Sydney Coiro’s “great sense of humor.” \n“She was extremely friendly with all the residents that were there and always had a smile on her face,” O’Neil said. “She would talk to them, get them to smile, and give compliments to them. ... She would help anyone that needed help.” \nHe recalled a time that he had come to work in a foul mood and Sydney Coiro had made a project of cheering him up. \n“She just got me to smile and laugh,” he said. “She made my mood a lot better and showed me the true meaning of what friendship was supposed to be.” Globe correspondent Bret Hauff contributed to this report.
