Have India found an ‘upgraded’ replacement for Virender Sehwag and Shikhar Dhawan in KL Rahul! KL Rahul has transformed as an all-round cricketer who is excelling in all the formats and has become an important part of the Indian cricket setup. By: Manas Tiwari | New Delhi | Published: February 5, 2017 2:17 PM KL Rahul has emerged as a genuine match-winner for India. (Source: PTI) \nKannur Lokesh Rahul or as you know him KL Rahul, is probably India’s biggest find in the batting department over the last 18 months. Once being groomed as a future Test prospect, Rahul has transformed as an all-round cricketer who is excelling in all the formats and has become an important part of the Indian cricket setup. \nHe is a mixture of class and big-hitting abilities, is backed by the captain Virat Kohli and has the on-field ‘swag’ that went missing since the retirement of Virender Sehwag. While there is no doubt that Sehwag is one of the best Indian openers that world cricket has seen, everyone knows the flaws in his batting technique. \nYou may also want to watch: \n\nIt is incredible that Sehwag achieved so much in his career with minimum footwork and even though it is yet to be seen if Rahul could replicate those numbers, he is certainly an upgrade for Sehwag on the technique front. \nAs far as Dhawan is considered, consistency has been his biggest enemy and led to his downfall but what’s special with Rahul is the fact that he knows how to convert starts into big totals. Rahul has played 12 Test matches so far and already has 4 centuries to his name from the 19 innings that he has played but is yet to get out between 50 and 100. \nWith just 26 international matches under his name, Rahul is already the third Indian batsman to have scored centuries in all the formats. Interestingly, in all the three formats he converted his maiden 50 plus score into a maiden century which is a sign of a matured and big player. \nYou may also want to watch: \n\nHis scoring rate is phenomenal as well. Rahul outscores both Virender Sehwag and Shikhar Dhawan in the T20Is. While Sehwag and Dhawan had the strike rates of 145.38 and 113.35 respectively, Rahul’s strike rate is of 150.54. \nLooking at those numbers, all we can say is that, even before the fans could have got over the heroics of Virat Kohli, they already have KL Rahul to exhilarate about.
