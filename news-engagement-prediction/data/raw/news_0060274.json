What is Cording? \nAmong healers the sharing of energy is referred to as cording. This cord represents life support tubing energetically connects two individuals together. Babies are born with a cord attaching them to their mothers, this is natural. Although some children are more strongly bonded with their father. But there comes a time for a parent to Cut the Apron Strings allowing a child to go out into the world on its own. This is appropriate. If the mother or father fails to break the cord, the child will eventually attempt to do it. This is also appropriate.We aren't meant to be sucking up other people's energy. We also don't want to be allowing any psychic vampires sucking up ours. Identifying Unhealthy Relationships \nThe world is full of unhealthy relationships. In these relationships, individuals cling to one another allowing cord attachments to occur between them. Seldom is the sharing done equally. Actually if the energy sharing was done equally it would be silly to have the cord in place at all. It is possible to be in a relationship without cording one another, in fact it is preferable. Couples that share one life source ordinarily create a relationship in which one individual becomes weaker, the other stronger. The weakened person feels collapsed because of giving away his/her life source. The stronger person feels great for a time, but his/her appetite may very well increase, craving more and more of the shared energy. Painful Breakups \nThere are different types of situations we face in life that are difficult. Ending relationships ranks pretty high up in the \"tough stuff\" category. It doesn't matter if you were the person who walked away or if someone else left you, a loss is felt either way. It is especially painful if a relationship ends without closure. Unfortunately, often times when people \"breakup\" what they don't realize is that they may very well still have cords attached. The intact cord keeps an open channel for continuous feeding on each others emotions and anxieties.Experiencing pain from an estranged relationship or troubled marriage? Try either the bridge visualization or infinity exercise to gently release the cord attachment to free yourself of continued feelings of sadness or separation. Wash That Man Right Out of My Hair Slam the Door on Psychic Vampires Cutting the Apron Strings Visualization Exercises Infinity Cutting Cords Visualization \nThe infinity exercise is a mental visualization of cutting cords between two individuals. Ideally, the person you are wishing to break emotional cords would be willing to participate in this exercise with you. But, two parties are seldom ready to release ties to a relationship at the same time. If you are ready and the other person is not, choose someone who is willing to act as a surrogate for the other person you are wishing to cut bonds with. How to Do the Infinity Exercise \nTwo persons face each other while standing 6-8 feet apart from one another. Visualize the infinity sign ( number 8 sideways) being traced repeatedly in a continuous loop. Each crossing of the infinity sign between you and the other person symbolizes severing the cord that is keeping the two of of you emotionally attached. This exercise can be done silently or with verbal statements emphasizing forgiveness and closure. You may like to visualize the encircling tracings in different colors as you deal with different feelings during this session. Red for releasing passions or feelings of anger, pink or green for calming heartaches, blue for banishing sadness, etc. Bridge Visualization \nVisualize a walking bridge in your mind. Imagine yourself standing on the far end of this bridge. Now imagine the person you are wanting to cut cords with is standing on the opposite end of the bridge. When you feel ready to energetically connect with the other person begin walking slowly to the middle of the bridge. Allow the other person to walk toward you, meeting you half way. Once you are in eye contact with one another you may begin communicating with an inner dialog. Tell the person what your feelings are. This is not a time to be angry or be holding onto grudges - you are releasing the ties. Tell the person that you are sorry for all of the things you said or did that hurt him/her. Tell him/her that you are forgiving him/her for all the hurtful things that were said or done in your relationship. Say your good-byes, wishing each other well in your separateness. Turn around and walk off the bridge. Note: It is okay if the other person remains on the bridge as they may not be as ready to be disconnected from you as you are and it may take some adjusting on his/her part to get used to being outside of your energy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:28:29.431+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
