(Shutterstock) \nThe brain-chemical system that is stimulated by listening to our favourite music also mediates the feelings of pleasure from sex, recreational drugs and tasty food, researchers have found. \n“This is the first demonstration that the brain’s own opioids are directly involved in musical pleasure,” said Daniel Levitin, from McGill University in Canada.

The brain chemical-system works in a similar fashion be it for sex or recreational drugs.

One said: ‘I know this is my favorite song but it doesn’t feel like it usually does’,” Levitin said. \nThings that people enjoy -- alcohol, sex, a friendly game of poker, to name a few -- can also lead to addictive behaviours that can harm lives and relationships. \nSo understanding the neurochemical roots of pleasure has been an important part of neuroscience research for decades. Music stimulates the same part of the brain as drugs.
