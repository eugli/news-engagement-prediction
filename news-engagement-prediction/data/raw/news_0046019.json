We would like to remind everyone to NEVER open your doors to any unfamiliar cattle.” \nThough identified as male by police, we are going to assume these milk-givers are female. \nPolice Sgt. Geoffrey Miner said officers were alerted to the cows after they were seen walking along the side of a road and in people’s yards, he told Western Mass News. \nBy the time officers caught up with them, they were outside one home’s front door. \n“When we pulled up, that’s right where they were when the picture was taken, at that person’s front door,” he told Western Mass News. \nAfter taking their photo ― one that has since been shared more than 7,500 times ― the officers helped herd them back to their farm. \nMiner blamed a broken fence for allowing the cows’ escape.
