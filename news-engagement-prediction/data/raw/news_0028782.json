He did a good job for the team. Aleksandar Mitrovic scored the winner for Newcastle at Wolves \n“He is a professional. He knows you have to concentrate on the game. Yes, we knew [what was coming] but one thing the FA has to maybe consider is what the fans say [to players]. Maybe, to control what the fans say in every stadium and then they have more respect.” \nT he 24-year-old England midfielder was always going to be in the line of fire at Molineux after being accused of referring to Wolves midfielder Romain Saiss as an \"Arab c***”, when the two sides met in September. \nShelvey, was subsequently banned for five games, fined £100,000 and ordered to attend a mandatory education course following an FA misconduct charge in December. He returned to action last month and his contribution - in an encounter settled by Aleksandar Mitrovic’s goal - was pivotal as Newcastle recorded their eleventh away win of the season to edge closer to a club record of thirteen. \n“It was terrible what happened to him” said the Newcastle captain, Jamaal Lascelles. \n“Jonjo is not that type of person. A few of us told him to keep his head. I just said 'play your football and you can embarrass them by being the best player on the pitch' and that is exactly what he did. \n“With this team, we approach every game to win and get three points. We are going to aim much higher than that [record].” Follow Telegraph Football", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T01:03:25.500+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
