Picture: Warren Lynam \nMr Smart and his wife were reeling after what followed as they were flooded with phone messages, Facebook comments and even negative reviews, from people blasting the cafe for booting Sen Hanson. \n“So, you guys can all go to hell and good luck with it all up there” one message left on the cafe’s voicemail said, the caller telling all tenants of C-Square they would be boycotting their businesses. \nSpeaking to the Daily during what should have been a busy lunchtime service but was now quiet, Mr Smart said it was “diabolical” some of the abuse they’d received. \nHe said he didn’t even know they’d been asked to move along until Friday night when he saw the online reaction to news reports. \n“It wasn’t us,” he said. \n“We’re a small business trying to make a living. \n“To us they’re all customers. I don’t care who they vote for or where they come from.” media_camera Endless Cafe has been copping abuse all weekend after a One Nation press conference. Picture: Warren Lynam \nThe direction given to Sen Hanson and her group had come from Centenary Square management, who in a Facebook post on Saturday explained they “did not intend any disrespect to anyone and apologise if any offence was taken”. \nThe post said C-Square management had explained political events couldn’t be held in the C-Square precinct, and they had asked the group to relocate when the press conference went ahead underneath an awning. \n“Our policy is that permission is needed for any event that takes place in the shared areas of C-Square. We gladly give that permission to community groups and for activities that relate to the centre and these events may involve politicians of all persuasions at times,” the post read. \n“However, we do not give permission for specifically political events, such as press conferences or political information booths, as our policy is to remain strictly neutral on these things.” \nMr Smart said he was supportive of the work C-Square had done in the space to reinvigorate the area and the concept of the site having no political allegiance and being open to all. \nHe said he had no issue with Sen Hanson, her beliefs or anyone else’s and made it clear his cafe was accepting of all people, even taking photos for customers wanting to pose with Sen Hanson. \n“Everybody’s welcome. It doesn’t matter what race, colour, creed or religion,” his wife Jean said. \n“I don’t care who you support, you’re a customer.” \nPhone messages, comments on Facebook calling for his business to be named and shamed, boycotted and even negative Google and Facebook reviews logged from people as far as Broken Hill who, to their knowledge, had never set foot in his cafe, were just some of the barbs directed at the couple’s business. \n“It’s just diabolical,” Mr Smart said. \nThe pair had worked 35 years to save up and buy the business and were devastated to see bad reviews being left on Google as a result of people assuming it had been them who ordered Sen Hanson to move on. \n“We got business out of it. Why would we move them on?” Mrs Smart said. \n“Everybody’s got the right to their own political views,” Mr Smart said. \n“That’s why I live in a democracy.” \nBuderim MP and One Nation state leader Steve Dickson said he didn’t think it had been the cafe that had asked them to move on and asked people to support all Nambour businesses as he didn’t want to see any business owners suffer.
