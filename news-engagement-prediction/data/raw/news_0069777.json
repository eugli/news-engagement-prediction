Save Soundwall \nThe latest version of Soundwall comes with a couple of extra features that make it even more interactive. You can think of a Soundwall either as an aluminum artwork that plays music or a flat-planel speaker disguised as a painting. Its new iteration called \" Nova ,\" however, kicks things up a notch by turning it into a touch-enabled artwork that can play music with a matching light show. \nNova's Magic Touch feature gives you the power to play, pause and skip songs -- streamed from your phone through Bluetooth -- by touching the artwork. \"Mood Lights,\" on the other hand, helps you set the ambiance. You can switch between blue lights for a relaxed, jazzy atmosphere, red for a more romantic one and white if you want some simple yet elegant, all within Soundwall's companion app. \nAccording to the Boulder-based company, Soundwall's whole surface is a speaker that uses Distributed Mode Loudspeaker technology to give off brilliant sounds. The aluminum adds to its sound's richness, as well. As for the artwork, the company uses archival inks and a dye-sublimation process to print it into aluminum and make sure it doesn't fade. \nYou can get a Soundwall through its website for a minimum of $900. It's pretty pricey, but then again, some people might see it as getting a piece of art and a speaker at the same time. If you do shop through the website, you'll have around 150 designs to choose from, though you can always upload your own for the most personalized option yet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:03:01.776+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
