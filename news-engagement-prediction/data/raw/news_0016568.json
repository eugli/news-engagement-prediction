Police dogs normally retire about age eight. \nSgt Evans, 59, has been told he will have to pass the animal - a Malinois cross German Shepherd - on to another handler to continue working, the family said. Police dogs It takes about 13 weeks to train a police dog Purchase and initial training costs about Â£24,000 The dogs usually retire around the age of eight, depending on fitness If the dog is approaching retirement at the same time as its handler, it would be considered for retirement. In cases where dogs are still young, they will often be re-handled \nSource: West Mercia Police \nThe petition has been signed by people from as far afield as Canada and New Zealand. Daughter Jennie said the response was \"incredible\". \nShe said Sgt Evans, of Market Drayton, had offered to buy Ivy and cover the cost of replacing her. \nMs Evans said: \"Dad sacrificed many family moments with the support of his wife to enable him to undergo months of training with his police dogs. \n\"West Mercia need to show they appreciate these efforts and do not treat dogs as dispensable equipment that can be 'handed down' to other people.\" \nWest Mercia Police said Chief Constable Anthony Bangham \"recognises the unique bond between an officer and his dog and has made a direct offer to speak to the officer personally about this\".
