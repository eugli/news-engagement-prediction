After some reported disagreement within the cabinet about pushing ahead with the measure, Trump is expected to issue new guidelines this week confirming his rollback of one of the few directives in U.S. history to support transgender rights. And his reasoning falls flat in the face of social justice: White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said during a press briefing yesterday that Trump believes equal bathroom access for children of all genders “is not something that the federal government should be involved in, this is a states’ rights issue.” Leaving the safety and well-being of children up to a state’s discretion—not federal protection—sends a very clear message about their national value, particularly from a party that has always lauded “family values” as their bottom line. Clearly not all kids deserve equal protection, nor have the privilege of even being deemed part of a “family values” agenda. Transgender children (and adults) already face a mountain of social, economic, and emotional hurdles, further flamed by abuse, lack of visibility, and pure discrimination—an acknowledgement of their gender identity could send a much-needed message in the antagonistic climate that is school. The revoking of President Obama’s sweeping order is happening in an America in which 78 percent of transgender/gender non-conforming students in grades K-12 have experienced harassment, according to the National Transgender Discrimination Survey, cited by GLAAD . 35 percent of students experienced physical assault and 12 percent have survived sexual violence. This abusive reality for kids becomes statistically fatal in adulthood. The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs reports that 55 percent of all reported LGBT and HIV-affected homicide victims in 2014 are of transgender women, and 50 percent are of transgender women of color. If help is on the way, it’s seldom help: Transgender people are seven times more likely to experience physical violence when interacting with police compared to cisgender survivors and victims. Proper bathroom access for transgender children is only the tip of much larger and deeply systemic transphobia—but it’s nevertheless a foundation for increased awareness about the daily obstacles and harassment that transgender Americans encounter every day, beginning in the fragility of childhood. Make no mistake: This executive move is a severe rollback of queer rights in the United States. And by a newly-minted president who has said he is “fine with” same-sex marriage, calling on a more nuanced parsing of queer advocacy from politicians, constituents, and of course, Americans. The line in the sand has been drawn, and while cisgendered marriages might be on one side, transgender rights—in their most basic form—are clearly on the other. Watch this space.
