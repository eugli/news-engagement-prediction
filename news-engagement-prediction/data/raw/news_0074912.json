Deven said though there were discussions with the makers to turn the show into a film, but they had to shelve the idea eventually.\n\"We had a couple of rounds of discussion with our writer and producer regarding this. But then it didn't work out the way we wanted to, so we thought to do something else with it,\" Deven told PTI.\nThe show became extremely popular for an unconventional take on saas-bahu nok jhok.\nSarabhai vs Sarabhai is now set to return as a web series and Deven says some new characters will be added.\n\"We will take a time leap and retain a few qualities and of course, all the successful characters. We add a couple of more new characters. It is going to come out very soon,\" said Deven, who is gearing up for his directorial debut, Commando 2.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T06:09:26.633+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
