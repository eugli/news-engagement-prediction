Now that the 35-year-old daughter of President Donald Trump has relocated to Washington, D.C., she’s often spotted in on-trend looks in her daily appearances from the White House to the Capitol Building (and the Trump Hotel too). From everyday work looks to extravagant gowns for upscale events, the first daughter’s outfits are generally always sophisticated and refined. Recently, the mother-of-three shared an image alongside Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and her father wearing a sleek black dress — an sleek option she often sticks with. On the same day, the three participated in a discussion on women in business, a platform the 35-year-old mother is passionate about, and helped to launch The Canada-United States Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders. Check out some of her most recent looks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:33:11.173+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
