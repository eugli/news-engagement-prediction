Elon Musk (Twitter) Since December, Elon Musk has been discussing plans to build a tunnel to help avoid LA traffic problems.

Musk tweeted that he would start digging on January 27th, and said during last weekend's Hyperloop that the plan is to increase tunneling by \"500 - 1000 percent.\" \nNow, (apparently away from the president's economic advisory council meeting ) he's posted this picture of a massive digging machine at work, simply titled \"Minecraft.\" So what are you doing with your weekend?
