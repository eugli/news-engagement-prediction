(Photo courtesy of Joshua Morgan-Green) Elizabeth Martino ‘s day began hours ago, when she climbed out of bed at 5 o’clock in the morning, threw on workout clothes and headed to her basement.\nEarly mornings have helped Martino, a freshman guard at National Christian , become a top-30 national recruit in her class, earn 30 Division-I scholarships before she had even entered high school, and have the likes of Maryland and Connecticut and UCLA fawning over her talent before she can drive a car.\n“I don’t want to be on top in the DMV,” she said. “I want to be on top of the world.”\nMartino is averaging 14.5 points per game this season, second-best on the team behind All-Met guard Mykea Gray’s 20.0 per night.\n“The sky is the limit for her,” Eagles Coach Henry Anglin said. “I’ve coached college players. I’ve coached WNBA players. Liz is right up there.”\nWhen Gray isn’t handling the ball in National Christian’s up-tempo offense, it’s in Martino’s hands, especially with her older sister and alternate point guard, Olivia , injured and out for the rest of the season.\n“I have to stay in shape,” Martino said. “It’s hard always getting up and down the court with the ball in my hands.”\nShe devised a personal workout routine last year to push her conditioning and build explosiveness on the court. At 5:20 a.m., after brushing her teeth and a quick breakfast, she hits the “Vertimax” machine, a weighted plank with resistance bands attached that latch onto her wrists and ankles. Then she jumps, and the bands try to pull her back to the ground.\nAfter 20 minutes, she pushes weighted sleds around her basement. After another 20 minutes, she’s on the treadmill running with a training mask that reduces air intake to strengthen respiratory muscles.\n“Elizabeth is easily one of the hardest-working female athletes I’ve ever trained,” said Joshua Morgan-Green, her personal trainer and skills coach, who works with Martino two or three times a week. “She will stop at nothing to become one of the greatest.”\nNUMBER CRUNCH: 17 \nYears since Thomas Jefferson ‘s girls’ basketball team has won three postseason games. The Colonials are two years removed from an 0-23 season. This year, they finished 13-14, and advanced to the second round of the Virginia 5A region tournament. Jefferson’s season ended Tuesday night with a 46-42 loss to Tuscarora.\nDOUBLE NUMBER CRUNCH: 62-41 \nThe final score from the postseason’s biggest shocker (so far). Patriot knocked off No. 20 Herndon Tuesday night in the opening round of the Virginia 6A girls’ region tournament.\nBREAKFAST LINKS: \nNo. 3 National Christian edges No. 5 Rock Creek Christian Maryland state basketball tournament preview: Boys | Girls Virginia state basketball tournament preview: Boys | Girls C.H.
