This comes just a fortnight after record-breaking highs across Queensland and New South Wales. Sydney averages 130mm of rain across the entire month of March, which is typically the third wettest for the city all year, but this year is expected to see a lot more. Over the next week, Sydney's could see more than 200 millimetres of rainfall, which is more than four times the amount that fell in the entire month of January After a stint of hot weather, the rain settled in across the city. Bondi Beach is pictured Weatherzone meterologist Jacob Cronje said the forcast rainfall 'looks almost monsoonal' The east coast is set to be drenched in up to 200mm of rain this week as storms are predicted almost every day from Brisbane to Melbourne Rob Sharpe, a meterologist with Weatherzone, told Daily Mail Australia: 'We've got a low-pressure trough lurking along the east coast. 'As we go through the week it will bring rain along the coast, but there is quite a high degree of uncertainty about where it will go. 'While most places have some chance of rain all this week, not everyone will see rain every day. Those with the highest chance of rain every day will be in the north.' Mr Sharpe added that coastal areas will largely see their showers in the morning and evening, while inland areas will get rain in the afternoons. Sydney is most likely to see rain on Thursday, Mr Sharpe said, with heavy showers and storms possible in the city. The heaviest showers are expected in northern New South Wales, with coastal areas seeing rain in the mornings and evenings, an inland areas getting hit in the afternoons Rain is expected to arrive for much of the east coast on Tuesday (left), before strengthening and moving south into Wednesday The risk of showers will continue throughout this week, across the weekend and into next week, Mr Sharpe said. While things are expected to start drying out early next week, even that is not certain, he added. Temperatures will remain firmly fixed at a high of 26C across the week, according to the Bureau of Meteorology, signalling the change to autumn. While there is a good chance that autumn will be warmer than average, Mr Sharpe said, there will not be a return to the extreme highs of summer.
