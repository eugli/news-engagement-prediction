The making of the statue costs $400, but before a trophy can be put up for bid, it must first be offered to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for just $10 — an Academy rule that was upheld in a 2015 court ruling. \nAmong the Oscar resale rule’s supporters is legendary director and Oscar-winner Steven Spielberg, who spent $1.36 million on Oscars belonging to Bette Davis and Clark Gable, only to donate them back to the Academy. \nWatch the video above.
