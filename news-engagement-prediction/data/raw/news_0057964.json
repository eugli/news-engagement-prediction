Ilitch’s son, Travis, played on a younger team in the organization, and Ilitch had volunteered to be an assistant coach.\nChris Ilitch stood on the field that night, working with my son, whom he didn’t even know. He dug balls out of an old bucket, hitting ball after ball while offering words of encouragement. Ilitch’s passion for baseball was obvious. Clearly, he loved what he was doing, just being on a field with a bat in his hands, working on the fundamentals.\nRelated:\nChris Ilitch speaks about Tigers plans: 'I love this franchise'\nThat memory came back on Friday afternoon, when Chris Ilitch stood in Joker Marchant Stadium, wearing a steel-blue suit and a Mr. I pin on his lapel as the Detroit Tigers honored his father, the late Mike Ilitch, before their first Grapefruit League game of spring training, a 2-0 loss against Baltimore.\nIt was a wonderful video tribute to a great owner, who died Feb. 10. But it also was symbolic in another way:\nThe Tigers are Chris Ilitch’s team now. He is the man out in front of this organization.\n“I share my father’s passion for baseball … and I love this franchise,” said Ilitch, speaking publicly for the first time as Tigers owner. “Quite frankly, I love this team. I think we have a team that could win a World Series.”\nIt is natural to wonder what will happen to the Tigers, as the ownership of the franchise passes from father to son. It is understandable to wonder whether the Ilitch family will sell or change course.\nBut if somebody goes out on a JV baseball field on a cold and gray night, working with a kid who wasn’t even on his team, there is no question in my mind: This is a guy who just loves baseball.\n‘No way’ Ilitch sells On Friday morning, Ilitch met with the Tigers in the clubhouse. “I told the players this morning: They are going to find the apple doesn’t fall too far from the tree,” Ilitch said.\nThen, he stood behind the cage and watched the Tigers take batting practice. He brought along 12 members from the West Oakland Wings, now a group of 13-year-olds, and all the kids wore their game jerseys.\nChris Ilitch still is a volunteer assistant coach for that team.\n“Here’s the one thing I can tell you,” said Brad Farquhar, the team’s head coach. “He has the worst job on our coaching staff. He’s the bullpen catcher. He readily accepts it. He has bruises on his shins to prove it.”\nYes, Chris Ilitch, the new owner of the Tigers, catches bullpens for a bunch of 13-year-olds.\nBuy Photo Tigers owner Chris Ilitch talks to reporters Friday, Feb. 24, 2017 at Publix Field at Joker Marchant Stadium in Lakeland, Fla. (Photo: Kirthmon F. Dozier, DFP)\nThe West Oakland Wings typically play between 50 and 60 games a year and they have traveled all over the country, going from Georgia to Kentucky to New York. “I don’t think he has missed a game, ever, not one,” Farquhar said. “Maybe a practice but not a game. He wants to be around his son, he wants to be around baseball.”\nLast summer, when the West Oakland Wings played at a week-long tournament at Cooperstown Dreams Park in upstate New York, Chris Ilitch was assigned an inglorious task. “It was his job to get the ice,” Farquhar said. “He was schlepping ice bags down. Now, he was smart enough to get a wagon.”\nHe spent a week sleeping in bunk beds in a cabin with no air conditioning, with a bunch of 12-year-olds, just like all the other coaches do at the Cooperstown tournament.\nRelated:\nDetroit Tigers would fetch princely sum if Ilitch heirs sell\n“He is down to earth and as real as you can get,” Farquhar said. “The kids call him Coach Ilitch. We call him Chris. His son Travis is a joy to have. Looks you in the eye. Shakes your hand. Works hard. I get on him like any kid.”\nThis winter, the West Oakland Wings had a team bonding night at Farquhar’s house. “It was a sleepover,\" Farquhar said. “There he was, in a sleeping bag.”\nWhile some fans wonder whether the Ilitch family will sell the team, now that Mike has died, Farquhar has spent countless hours with Chris Ilitch, at probably a couple hundred travel baseball games, and he is convinced that won’t happen.\n“No way,” Farquhar said. “No way. He loves baseball. He appreciates what his dad built.”\nRemembering Mike Ilitch Mitch Albom: Mike Ilitch loved his teams as much as we do Mike Ilitch’s complex relationship with Detroit Ilitch leaves music, entertainment legacy in downtown Detroit Would Mike Ilitch's story be possible today?

It was the West Oakland Wings. Travis Ilitch sat in the middle of the team, taking his hat off during a moment of silence for his grandfather.\nIt was a touching, classy celebration with a video tribute played on the new video screen in left field, part of the $48-million renovation of this stadium. “Physical environment is a big part of creating a culture,” Ilitch said, sounding a lot like his father, and certainly following the example set by his father. “We are a world-class organization and that is what we want to remain. This is a big part of it.”\nDuring the ceremony, Chris Ilitch stood on the grass, as Victor Martinez, Ian Kinsler, Francisco Rodriguez and Justin Upton revealed a Mr. I insignia painted along the first-base line. It seemed so fitting, to have some of the biggest stars take part in the celebration. Mr. I always loved stars. He understood how the fans come to watch the stars play.\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Orioles 2, Tigers 0 in Grapefruit League opener Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

(Photo: Kirthmon F. Dozier, DFP)\nChris Ilitch said there is no mandate to cut the payroll but that remains to be seen. He talked about the importance of finding talent and developing players, which takes on a different meaning when you consider how he spends his summer. Developing talent? Learning to field a grounder? A youth baseball coach understands that better than anybody, especially after he has hit countless ground balls to kids and has caught countless pitches in the bullpen.\nWill that make him a good owner? Not necessarily. But it's a great place to start.\nIt seems clear: Chris Ilitch isn’t going anywhere. He loves baseball too much.\nContact Jeff Seidel: jseidel@freepress.com.
