Peculiar, given that this bunch of cretins seemed to be hugely insensitive to the will of the 63 million Americans who voted for President Trump and are delighted they finally have a businessman for a president. This was a debate with no legal force and no vote. A debate contrived purely as a form of protest. To pat on the head the 1.9 million sad individuals who believed they were empowered when they clicked on a petition. (If clicking online makes your manhood feel bigger, why not do your Sainsbury's shop online instead? You'll be straddling a giant sequoia by the time you get to the frozen aisle.) Protesters poured into Parliament Square tonight for a rally condemning President Trump ahead of his state visit to Britain later this year As night fell over Westminster, the debate continued inside Parliament and a noisy rally began outside on Parliament Square The Stop Trump Coalition even organised a National Day of Action to coincide with it, enabling the great unwashed to protest once again. Some people even bothered to make new rude signs about Trump or their steel vaginas. And loudly they protested, right outside the protest debate being held as a result of the protest petition that they had all clicked on earlier in protest. A beautiful circle of protest-life, cannibalising itself right there outside Parliament. Alex Salmond asked if desperation was behind the state visit. I suspect desperation for attention played a large part in his wish to take up two seats in the crowded debating chamber. He demanded that the invite for a state visit be rescinded, knowing full well it was already set in stone. Thousands of people were due to attend the protest on Parliament Square tonight Protesters accused Donald Trump of 'racism' and urged the Prime Minister to cancel his state visit to Britain Happily, Caroline Lucas was on hand to speak for Vegan Matters and the lesbians of Brighton. She wished to deny Trump a visit to the UK because of his denial of basic climate science. I suspect she is also cross he loves a good cheeseburger, but she didn't have time to vocalise this important political point. Curiously, I found myself warming to Nigel Evans, despite him being Welsh. He advised the room of gathered narcissists that Trump was voted as president and it was time for us to get over it. “He will go down in history as the only man in history condemned for delivering on his promises. I have seen no evidence of him being racist. When we attack Donald Trump, we are attacking the American people, and the decisions they made.“ It was a brave speech, and a good one, too. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott joined the protesters outside the Palace of Westminster and addressed the crowd on Parliament Square Protesters against Donald Trump arrived for a massive rally outside Parliament today as MPs prepared to debate petitions on his state visit Suddenly David Lammy was on his feet to talk about the fact his dad was buried in the United States and he had spent more time in America than in France. Fascinating as this insight into his travel history was, we all wished he would get to the point. He was there to speak for African Americans, presumably on the basis that he is himself black. This is my least favourite type of political argument, akin to me asserting I speak for all women purely because I used to sport a perky pair of 36Bs in my prime. Inspired, Naz Shah (back from suspension from the Labour Party for suggesting Israel should be relocated to the US) jumped up to speak for Muslims everywhere — again, because she is one. Sadly, reading her own writing is a challenge for her. Or reading at all. She tried to remind us what jolly good sorts Muslims are, and of the endless value they bring to Bradford. The Metropolitan Police are braced for angry protests on Parliament Square as MPs respond to a huge petition against the visit going ahead (I wondered if she was going to mention Bradford drugs kingpin Mohammed Yassar Yaqub, previously acquitted of attempted murder and killed by police marksmen on Monday in a “pre-planned operation”; curiously, she gave him a wide birth.) One after another they read their nonsense, pegged on any hook they could find. A mother with mixed-race kids, a Green Party vegan, a black man, a Muslim, a Clinton campaigner, a daughter of an asylum-seeker, a woman (I think). All with their own agendas, their own causes, their own issues, tenuously linked to minorities or those desperate to be victims, just as Clinton did. Losing sight of the actual debate, blinded by their adherence to a muddled cause. This is the state of our democracy today. These men and women committing three hours to a futile debate to signal they are on the side of the liberals, ignoring the democratic decision of 63 million Americans and the majority of the British people who are still in favour of a state visit for the 45th President of the United States. They are deaf to the will of the people, preferring to listen to the voice of protest instead. This is the state of British politics. It is an unfortunate sight. Pathetic, truly.
