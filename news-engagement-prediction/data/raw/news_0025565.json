Paul Hollywood might soon have a new co-judge on GBBO Credit: PA \nA source told The Sun: \"Both are from similar backgrounds, so hopefully viewers will be accepting and give Prue a chance to win them over. \n\"Following in Mary's footsteps is a big challenge. But the producers are confident that Prue has all the attributes. In cookery circles she's practically royalty.\" \nThe South African-born author, campaigner and restaurateur stepped down as a judge on The Great British Menu in October after 10 years on the programme. \nThe makers of the show, Love Productions, said in a statement: \"We will be announcing the line-up of The Great British Bake Off in due course.\" \nLast month Berry was named best TV judge at the National Television Awards for GBBO. Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins completed the former cast of GBBO Credit: PA Who is Prue Leith? \nPrue Leith first started as a cook at a firm of solicitors but has gone on to become one of Britain's best loved restaurateurs and food writers. \nAfter training at Le Cordon Bleu cookery school in London she worked as a caterer before opening her restaurant Leith's in west London in 1969. \nIn 1974 she founded her own cookery school, Leith's School of Food and Wine, which trains professional chefs and amateur cooks. \nFamous alumni of the school include Lorraine Pascale, Gizzi Erskine and Matt Tebbutt, as well as Michelin-star chefs including Joe Mercer Nairne and Matt Christmas. Lorraine Pascal is one of a string of famous alumni to have attended a Leith's School of Food Credit: ITV \nThe South African-born cook, 76, has written a dozen cookbooks, most famously Leith's Cookery Bible - a textbook for her school which is frequently updated. \nShe sold the school in the early 1990s before setting up a college in South Africa and has carved out a career as a cooking columnist and novelist, as well as a television personality. \nLeith judged the BBC cookery show The Great British Menu for 11 years before stepping down at the end of last year. \nShe was awarded an OBE in 1989 and a CBE in the 2010 Birthday Honours.
