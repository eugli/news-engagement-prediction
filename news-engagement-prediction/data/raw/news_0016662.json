They lifted and bagged the murthis [statues] as if it was going to hurt them,” said one of the staffers who asked not to be named.\nShe said seven executive members and a security guard visited the manager’s office following an anonymous tip-off. Maphanga allegedly told the operational manager that she would be investigated and charged, but did not specify what the charges were. The staff member said this was not the first time the manager was targeted as she had only returned to work last month following another incident, of which she did not disclose the details.\nThe operational manager was moved to a different ward when she returned to work at the beginning of the year.\n“They want her [the operational manager] to be so mentally tortured that she will resign.\n“They continuously mock and humiliate her and give her the work that a junior would do,” said the staffer.\nProvoncial Department of Health spokesperson Sam Mkhwanazi said in a statement yesterday that the matter would be fully investigated.\n“If any individual is found guilty of contravening another’s constitutional rights, they will be subjected to the most appropriate sanction allowed by law,” Mkhwanazi said.\nHe said the department fully upheld the rights of all citizens to follow and practise any religion of their choice, “so long as such rights do not interfere with operations in the workplace”.\nChairperson for the health portfolio committee at KZN Legislature, Yusuf Bhamjee, also intervened in the matter.\nBhamjee said he welcomed the department’s “very proactive” stand on the issue and hoped those who guided Maphanga would also “be brought to book”.\nNorthdale Hospital staffer Yugan Naidoo said a meeting with union Hospersa and the community would be held on Thursday.\nNaidoo said the staff intend to call for the immediate dismissal of hospital CEO Maphanga.\nNaidoo said the matter was reported to the Midlands Hindu Society and the Human Rights Commission.\nPresident of the Midlands Hindu Society, Ranjiv Nirghin, said he hoped the matter would be fully investigated and steps taken by the government to build social cohesion.\nHe said the MHS was especially concerned that the management involved allegedly disrespected the religious beliefs of a long-serving employee of the hospital.\n“There should be more sensitivity when dealing with the religious beliefs of all employees.\n“It is also alleged that no reasons were given to the employee for the removal of her religious items when the items were removed from her cupboard,” Nirghin said.\nIan Webster, human resources consultant at Simply Communicate, said he believed there could be a case of unfair discrimination under the Employment Equity Act.\n“There may be good reason for not allowing the display of religious icons, but these were in a ‘private’ locker. In this country to confuse Hindu idols and icons with Voodoo, is not just ignorant, it is also the sort of intolerance we so desperately need to exclude.", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/News24/SouthAfrica/Articles&sz=600x50&c=117340294&t=artid%3db5c43bde-bb5d-48aa-9e1b-6dc6e678111a%26Places%3dpietermaritzburg%26Topics%3ddiscrimination%26accreditation%3dthe+witness%26posno%3d1", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/News24/SouthAfrica/Articles&sz=600x50&c=117340294&t=artid%3db5c43bde-bb5d-48aa-9e1b-6dc6e678111a%26Places%3dpietermaritzburg%26Topics%3ddiscrimination%26accreditation%3dthe+witness%26posno%3d1"], "published": "2017-02-06T10:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:02:03.875+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
