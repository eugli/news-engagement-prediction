It’s a great feeling. No better place to do it than Melbourne.” \nWWE congratulated Serena Williams on her achievements shortly after her victory. Triple H sent her a tweet that included an image of a customized Serena Williams WWE Championship belt. \nThe Serena Williams WWE Championship belt has side-plates which show all four major Grand Slam tournaments she has dominated during her 22-year long tennis career. #WWE sent Serena Williams her own Championship belt! pic.twitter.com/anVBzkpyKj \n— ScreenCritics (WWE) (@WWECritics) February 21, 2017 \nOn Monday, Serena posted a picture of the WWE Championship belt on Reddit, the social media platform co-founded by her fiancé Alexis Ohanian. \nSerena Williams is not the only athlete that WWE has gifted with a customized Championship belt. The wrestling company has made it a hallmark to award WWE Championship belts to athletes who excel in their various sport. \nIn 2016, several athletes and teams including the Chicago Cubs, Denver Broncos, and the New England Patriots were all awarded custom-made WWE Championship belts.

Although it may seem far-fetched, Serena has shown some signs of retiring from tennis. And WWE has a long history of making sports stars and other celebrities appear on their network. \nSerena Williams, who has played fewer matches since 2013, may slowly be retiring and health issues may be an influencing factor, according to Bleacher Reports . \n“If I’m losing I’m going to figure out a way to win, so I can’t sit here and say that would be it…Health issues can be tough. I have been dealing with a lot of health issues since Wimbledon and that has been really frustrating. I told Venus (Williams) that it ruined my Olympics,” Serena said. \nSerena Williams could make an appearance at WWE’s upcoming Wrestlemania 33 scheduled for April like Ronda Rousey did in 2015. But that is pure speculation. \nFormer UFC Women’s Champion Ronda Rousey appeared on a WWE stage. However, she did not fight. The MMA star appeared at Wrestlemania 31 along with wrestler and actor, the Rock. \nThere have been talks that Serena Williams’ WWE appearance could see the tennis great go against WWE women’s star Charlotte Flair, Morning News USA reported. Although it is unlikely that Serena and Charlotte are going to get into a physical fight , they may still be made to compete. \nSerena Williams’ WWE appearance on Wrestlemania 33 will be one of the high points of the show, if it does happen.

The 35-year-old tennis star used Reddit to announce her engagement with a story of how Alexis proposed. \n[Featured Image by Bradley Kanaris/Getty Images]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:27:18.531+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
