The car was titled as a personal vehicle. President Trump owned the car for a little over four years during which time the car accrued a little over 2,400 miles. To see a former or current President's personal vehicle offered for sale is extremely rare. It's highly likely Donald Trump is the only United States President to ever own a Supercar. This Ferrari F430 is very special and is sure to make an excellent addition to any collection. Ferrari F430.

Designed by Pininfarina, a great deal of attention was paid to making the car as aerodynamic as possible, while also paying homage to past Ferraris. The newest F1 developments to trickle down to Ferrari road cars were the electronic differential (E-Diff), used to maximize the application of engine torque, as well as the steering wheel mounted manettino switch, which allowed for quick adjustment of vehicle dynamics. The F430 was produced through 2009 at which time it was replaced in the Ferrari line-up by the 458. Ferrari F430.

The car is powered by a 4.3-litre, 490-hp, V-8 engine capable of propelling the car to a top speed of 196-mph. It's paired to a six-speed F1 paddle shift transmission, cutting shift times down to an astonishing 150-milliseconds. \nThe interior is completed in Beige leather featuring Daytona-style seats, a leather headliner and Castoro (light brown) carpet. The gauge cluster features Gaillo (yellow) instrumentation as well as carbon fiber inserts throughout the dashboard. Ferrari F430.

Accompanying the F430 are original books, manuals, tool kit, car cover with bag as well as the charging kit. Service records are included as well, with work completed by Ferrari - Maserati of Long Island. A fluid service and New York state inspection are the most recent service records. Ferrari F430.

At the time of its release, it was one of the most technologically advanced performance cars on the market. Already a low production vehicle, its provenance is significantly increased by President Trump's ownership.
