Since 2010, the price of a seat on a train has risen 25 per cent, according to research by the TUB and the rail union's Action for Rail campaign. \nPassengers are now spending six times more on fares than their peers in Europe, the campaign suggests. \nWe did a quick spot check on Thursday of both train and flight prices for the weekend ahead, to see how they would compare for anyone wanting a last-minute city break away. Around the world by budget airline \nOne thing we found when searching the National Rail Enquiries website for journeys between UK cities was that, in almost all cases, choosing a slightly slower, but still direct, train meant that you could often pay less than half the price quoted for other return tickets on the same dates. \nBearing that in mind, for the purposes of this comparison, we chose the cheapest train rates offered, even if they were not the quickest trains, though we drew the line at rates for journeys that were more than half an hour longer than they could be. If you were minded not to spend any longer than necessary on a train, you might find the following rail journeys significantly more expensive.

A last-minute train from London to Leeds was £104, one from London to Sheffield was £116, London to Hull was £124 and one from London to York was £155. EasyJet is one budget airline offering European flights that are cheaper that UK train travel Credit: Simon Dawson \nIf you wanted to fly from London to Europe however, there were a fair few bargains to be had. \nA return flight with Ryanair to Hamburg, Germany, from London Stansted cost just £77.50, for example, flying at around 7am each morning. \nOr you could fly from London Stansted to Salzburg in Austria, on those same dates with Ryanair, as long as you only took carry-on luggage, for £98.92. \nLondon Stansted to Barcelona el Prat airport was available for just £117.28. London Luton to Malta on those same dates with Ryanair cost £155 - the same price as the London to York train journey. We know where is sunnier. \nFurther north, a four-hour train ride between Birmingham and Edinburgh this weekend would cost you £167.

Or Skyscanner had plenty of deals for single flights in and out of Paris for the weekend, starting at £101 return. \nIt seems fair to draw the conclusion that budget airlines are still providing us with historically affordable ways of getting to Europe. And as national train fares continue to increase, unless you’ve booked train tickets in advance for your weekend getaway (a return from London to Manchester from a Friday to Sunday in May is only £59), you could do a lot worse than booking some last-minute flights to Europe.
