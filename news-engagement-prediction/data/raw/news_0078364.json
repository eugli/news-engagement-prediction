But sometimes, they have a duty to follow up, just in case. \nWhen Skylar Holt told her teacher that her dad has lots of weed at home, and that he was growing it too, the teacher pulled him aside. \nREAD MORE: \nRecounting the scene on Facebook Californian dad Dax Holt writes: \nMy child's teacher: \"so Skylar tells me you guys have a ton of weed at home.\" \nMe: \"umm\" Ad Feedback \nTeacher: \"she said you're growing it\" \nTo clear things up Holt gets Skylar on camera and asks: \"what did you tell your teachers today?\" \nThe youngster then innocently replies; \"Weed is not good for you. Because weed is stuff that is grass but it's not grass because it's weed.\" \n\"Did you tell them we have a lot of weed in our house?\" Holt replied. \n\"Yeah, a lot of it,\" Skylar answers with a smile. \nIn an effort to set the record straight and confirm that he isn't growing illegal drugs in his spare time, Holt then asks Skylar to explain exactly what she means. \nWe then see Skylar in the back yard pointing out innocent garden weeds growing around the edges of the lawn. \n\"Oh that, that's the weed you are talking about?\" the dad said. \n\"Yep, and here, and here,\" Skylar confesses while pointing out all the weeds in the garden. \nHolt shared the video on his Facebook page where it has now been viewed more than 90,000 times. \nI guess we can all agree that Holt isn't growing cannabis in his spare time…. He may well be cultivating a new TV personality though as the incident has turned Skylar into a bit of a star. - essentialkids.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T10:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T06:07:32.200+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
