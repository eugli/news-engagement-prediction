Long Story \nIt has to be one of the most iconic scenes for anyone who’s into the history of bodybuilding: Arnold Schwarzenegger, and his otherwordly bulging muscles, in the movie Pumping Iron smoking weed. \nSince then, it’s become gymrat testament that the herb helps you recover faster after ripping muscles due to its anti-inflammatory and pain relieving properties . \nJim McAlpine is in that camp. The 46-year-old is so sold on the benefits of ganja for pumping iron, that he´s planning to open up a gym where you'll be encouraged to smoke weed. Presumably, in between sets. My early morning exercise: Doing kush-ups. — Weed Tweets ™ (@welovingkush) April 29, 2016 \nPower Plant Gym is slated to open in San Francisco in May, and the owner says the point of the gym is to debunk stereotypes about cannabis. You know, things like all stoners do is eat Cheetos and giggle their asses off at the lowest-rated movies on Netflix... \n“If you use it right cannabis takes the things you love and lets you love them more,” McAlpine said to The Daily Mail .“With fitness that can help get you into the zone, into eye-of-the-tiger mode.” The only exercise I've done this week is running out of weed. pic.twitter.com/frIj0zVzbd — Weed Humor (@WeedHumor) May 7, 2016 \nTo make it happen, McAlpine has teamed up with a weed advocate who you probably recall if you follow any stories with weed and sports in the tagline: Ricky Williams, the former Miami Dolphins' star running back. William got suspended from the league for smoking marijuana three times before retiring in 2004. Since then, he´s been a big time backer of allowing players to use marijuana to help them recover from injury. \nI don't know if I'd want to go to the gym after smoking weed, or if I'd want to smoke weed at the gym, but it could definitely make the day after leg day a little more bearable. Own The Conversation \nIs weed actually that beneficial for the gym, or is it just wishful thinking? Drop This Fact \nMarijuana leads to munchies, which leads to not so good gains? Not necessarily. A study in the American Journal of Epidemiology found that people who smoke at least three times a week have lower rates of obesity than people who don’t.
