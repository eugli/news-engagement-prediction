This is according to a report by the City Press .\nThe report also stated that Ngcobo was promoted to his latest position without the required NQF Level 6 qualification (National Diploma).\nThe City Press stated that during Ngcobo’s screening process, a warrant officer did not tick the box indicating whether Ngcobo had passed matric. A note “Panel to see” was written on the form.\nNgcobo submitted a matric certificate which many within the SAPS alleged was fake.\n“Two sources within the police service said there was an investigation into Ngcobo’s qualifications, but it was later abandoned before completion,” stated the report.\nAnother warning sign was Ngcobo’s CV, which stated that he joined the SAPS in March 1995 as a constable, but also passed matric in Umlazi in the same year.\nOn his government employment form, Ngcobo wrote he passed matric in 1982.\nNgcobo told the City Press that he had a matric certificate and referred the newspaper to a police spokesperson.\nSAPS spokesperson Sally de Beer said: “This matter is an employer/employee relationship issue and the department is not prepared to converse via the media.”\nNgcobo then employed a public relations company to contact the City Press to convince it he had a matric certificate.\nWhen the newspaper asked for a copy of the certificate, Ngcobo stopped replying to calls.\nNow read: Eskom will cut off electricity to municipalities, but not Soweto", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T12:11:45.446+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
