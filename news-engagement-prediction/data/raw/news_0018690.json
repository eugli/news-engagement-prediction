We believe that this new service provides the solution.\n“We have trialled it thoroughly and with the help of our trial residents we have almost flipped the recycling rate in the trial areas. We used to throw away 60% and recycle around 40%. The trial areas have turned this rate on its head, meaning almost 60% of waste is now diverted from disposal and recycled instead. That’s got to be good for the environment.”\nLast updated Tue 7 Feb 2017 Exmouth Devon", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T19:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T10:02:33.532+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
