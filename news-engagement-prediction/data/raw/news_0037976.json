Remember Me NS Yoon-G opens up about her singing career on 'Talking Street' By KpopJoA 14 minutes ago 1,833 167 0 0 Google+ Broadcast on February 15, singer NS Yoon-G discussed her career status on JTBC 's 'Talking Street.' \n\"It's been a year and a half since I stood live in front of the camera. I am nervous,\" the singer admitted. \nReferring to her career, NS Yoon-G commented, \"Ranking, many tend to focus on the numbers. When I saw I was in the 26th spot, there was not one person who said, 'You worked hard. It's okay.' Feeling down, the singer said, 'I didn't go outside after that. I thought if I did, many people would feel bad for me. It felt as if my world was literally caving in on me.\" \nShe continued, \"I went to the hospital, and I was diagnosed with Otolithiasis. The doctor said it was due to great stress. That's why I went to the U.S. to clear my mind and that's when the rumors began about me quitting the industry. Thinking it wasn't right to be living in distress, I decided to come back to Korea.\" Hopefully, NS Yoon-G will release a hit soon!
