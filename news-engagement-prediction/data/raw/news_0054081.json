Being the person who is looking to discover all these things, I have permission to push the envelope a little bit.” \nJensen actually nabbed his first gig with Periscope while still in college. But after two and a half years, he said, “I had this desire to broaden my horizons a little bit.” He decided to take a job at a startup in Australia, spending a year and a half there before returning to Minneapolis and, eventually, to Periscope. \nIn addition to tinkering with the hottest tech, Jensen is also responsible for explaining his work and schooling all of the agency’s departments—including creative, media and account management—on digital. For example, he built an internal blog platform that staffers use to post about tech trends for folks who prefer to read about technology rather than see it. More than 250 pieces of content have been posted to the platform in the past six months from 25 contributors. \n“The way that you explain these emerging platforms and innovation to people is always different,” Jensen explained. “For some, a presentation and a demonstration is great—they understand it and run with it. With others, they need to get hands-on.” \nCurriculum vitae \nSenior emerging media and platform innovation strategist, Periscope 2016 – present", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:18:40.330+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
