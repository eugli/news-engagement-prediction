Cheese’s while interviewing for a job, right? Well, think again, because this job interview was just downright odd. \nDaniel Dougherty, an 18-year-old from Derby, had to walk out of his interview at TGI Fridays after a series of questions left him shocked — questions that included if he’d “rather watch his parents have sex for a year or join in just for the start?” Yep, that was asked.

It was quickly followed by, would I eat chocolate-flavored shit or shit-flavored chocolate. I humored him by saying ‘chocolate-flavored shit,’ but then stood up to go.” \nThe funny part is that most of the food at Fridays tastes like shit. \nHere’s what Fridays had to say: “Fridays offers an industry-leading recruitment process, and this incident fell severely below our high standards. The questions posed during the interview with the candidate are absolutely not part of TGI Friday’s interview process and we were very disappointed to learn of this incident. \nThe idiot who asked the questions has also been suspended. \nFridays has offered Dougherty the chance to interview again, but Dougherty obviously will not take the offer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T21:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:36:23.676+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
