A boost to Philadelphia tourism For the Plymouth Meeting Mall, annual visitors would \"catalyze an interior re-merchandising effort that will further complement the existing experience,\" Joseph F. Coradino , CEO of mall owner Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust, said in an earlier statement. The Lego brand's recent successes, however, could also give the region a boost. An Uber for Explorers: La Salle strikes partnership with ride-hailing service \"One of the exciting things for the region about the opening of the Legoland Discovery Center in the Plymouth Meeting Mall is Lego's high visibility across different media,\" said Wesley S. Roehl , professor of tourism management at Temple University’s School of Sport, Tourism & Hospitality Management Lego is a \"highly visible brand,\" with its line of toys, television shows, Legoland Parks, Legoland Discovery Centers, and movies like 2014's The Lego Movie , the recently released The Lego Batman Movie and this September's The Lego Ninjago Movie. The Lego Movie raked in more than $257.7 million in the United States, according to Box Office Mojo, while The Lego Batman Movie has brought in more than $110 million as of Feb. 21.

Along with the \"halo effect,\" it also adds another attraction to the region's inventory of things to see and do.
