(Donald Miralle/Getty Images) \nSCOTTSDALE, Ariz. – Oh to be young again. \nWhen a 20-year-old Tiger Woods was interviewed by two-time U.S. Open winner Curtis Strange during the week of his professional debut in 1996 he came out swinging, saying he was gunning for a victory. \nDespite the fact Woods was coming off three straight U.S. Amateur wins and was clearly a special breed of player, the answer caught Strange a little off guard. \nAfter a smirk, Strange recaptured his thoughts and the following conversation continued: \nStrange : “A victory?” To me that comes off a little cocky or brash. Especially talking to the other guys who have been out here on TOUR for years and years and years. Certainly an incredible amateur record but what do you say to those guys. When you come out here in your first pro tournament and say, I can win?” \nWoods : I understand that. I have always figured why go to a tournament if you’re not going there to try and win? There’s really no point in even going. That’s the attitude I have had my entire life and that’s the attitude I’ll always have. As I would explain to my Dad, second sucks and third’s even worse. \nStrange : On TOUR that’s not too bad sometimes though. \nWoods : That’s not too bad but I want to win, that’s just my nature. \nStrange : You’ll learn. \nIt’s fascinating to hear the veteran almost chastise the young Woods. How dare he think he can just jump out and win. How dare he essentially declare he doesn’t need to go through any sort of initiation period and not bide his time. \nOf course Woods didn’t really learn from Strange or the other veterans at all. He won soon after and now has won 79 times on the PGA TOUR. To some he is the greatest player to have ever picked up a club. Interviews Curtis Strange interviews Tiger Woods at the 1996 Greater Milwaukee Open \nThe key takeaway from the exchange is Woods, despite his young age, was not afraid. He was ready to win from the beginning. And he went about doing it. \nFast forward 20 years or so and we are seeing first-hand the fallout from such “arrogance.” \nWoods inspired a whole new style of golfer. Kids watched his dominance. They watched his confidence. They learned not to fear and winning … well it’s not everything, it’s the only thing for most of these guys. They also had the added bonus of not playing against Woods in his absolute prime. If they may have feared anyone, it might have been him. \nSeason 2016-17 on the PGA TOUR is 11 events old. Eight of the victories have come from players in their 20s. The latest, 22-year-old Jon Rahm, jumped from a clustered Farmers Insurance Open leaderboard on a U.S. Open venue with a stunning aggressive back nine push. Among others he overtook fellow youngsters in Patrick Rodgers, Ollie Schniederjans, Tony Finau and C.T. Pan. \nIt was almost a show of contempt for a very tough course. Rahm closed in 30, with two eagles and two birdies in his last eight holes. He deliberately attacked while others tried to survive. No fear. \nJustin Thomas (23) already has three wins this season – and he shot a 59. Hideki Matsuyama (24) is already arguably Japan’s greatest golfer and he keeps winning. Cody Gribble (26), MacKenzie Hughes (26) and Hudson Swafford (29) also have trophies this season. \nThe current world No.1 and THE PLAYERS champion Jason Day (29) is still in his 20s. Jordan Spieth (23) already has two majors and a FedExCup win. The current FedExCup champion, Rory McIlroy, is still just 27 and he has four majors. There are countless others to add to the list. Even on the European Tour the latest winner was young gun Jeung-hun Wang (21). \nHow are they all so fearless? \n“I'd say it's because of him (Tiger) honestly. I think what Tiger did, you can't put into words what he did and continues to do for this game,” Thomas said recently in Hawaii. \n“I got into golf, as much as I did, watching him play. I knew he was in his early 20s and winning majors. People talk about how big of a deal it is to win a TOUR event in their low 20s, but the golf ball doesn't know how old you are. \n“I think that's a mentality I've always had. I've never understood why a 55-year-old can't win and the same reason an 18-year-old can't win. Their games may not be as exactly matured or not at the peak they could be at some point in their career, but like I said, that golf ball doesn't know. “I think watching him do what he did at his young age, at least for me, it gave me all the hope that I could do it.” \nSo while Woods’ return at Torrey Pines last week certainly lifted interest and crowd numbers, Rahm’s win is just the ticket to continue to show everyone the youth brigade certainly has the game in great shape going forward. \nRahm is from Spain. Spieth and Thomas are just a few of many out of America. Day is Australian. McIlroy comes from Northern Ireland. Hughes is Canadian. Matsuyama hails from Japan. Wang is Korean. Pan comes from Chinese Taipei. The point is the global game is in great hands. \nLet’s hope they are now inspiring others, just as they were inspired. \nYou can be sure the faithful fans out this week at the   Open will bring the noise for the youth brigade. They bring it for everyone. But they should have a special reception for Rahm. \nAs a former Arizona State student Rahm has some serious local ties. On a sponsor invite as an amateur he finished T5 in the tournament in 2015. \nNow he returns a winner with an exceptional chance to win in back-to-back weeks. \nThomas proved recently in Hawaii – you’re never too young for that.
