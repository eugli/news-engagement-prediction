Bush — in an extremely rare attack on a federal judge from a sitting President. \n“The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!” Mr. Trump tweeted early in the day. \nIn the evening, he posted: “The judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart. Bad people are very happy!” In this videograb released by the United States Courts, U.S. District Judge James Robart rules on Friday in Seattle on the travel ban imposed by President Donald Trump. | Photo Credit: JOSE ROMERO \nLate Saturday, the Justice Department filed its motion to appeal. The case will now move to a federal appeals court. \nNevertheless, government authorities began complying with the lower court judge’s ruling, reopening the borders to those with proper travel documents. \nThe State Department told visa holders from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen that they are again allowed to travel as long as the documents had not been “physically cancelled”. \nThe department earlier said up to 60,000 people had their visas revoked as a result of Mr. Trump’s order, although a Justice Department attorney put the number at closer to 100,000. \nThe Department of Homeland Security — which runs border agencies — also said it would cease implementing the order. \n‘Contemptuous’ \nThe restrictions on all refugees and travellers from the seven countries went into effect a week ago, wreaking havoc at airports across America and leaving travellers trying to reach the United States in limbo. \nThe political backlash for Mr. Trump has been equally severe, with the order fuelling numerous mass protests and internal White House infighting. \nIn Washington, hundreds of demonstrators marched from the White House to Capitol Hill, chanting “Donald, Donald, can't you see — we don't want you in DC!” \nAbout 3,000 people rallied in New York, while an estimated 10,000 people turned out in London, and smaller gatherings took place in Paris, Berlin, Stockholm and Barcelona. \nMr. Trump was forced to defend a botched rollout of the plan — which called his government’s competence into question — and fired the government’s acting Attorney-General for refusing to defend the order in court. \nHis approval rating has sunk to the lowest level on record for any new President. \nHis latest rhetorical outburst is only likely to stoke the controversy. \nPresidents from Thomas Jefferson to Barack Obama have criticised court rulings, but have rarely, if ever, criticised individual judges. \n“I can’t think of anything like it in the past century and a half at least,” constitutional scholar and Harvard Law professor Laurence Tribe told AFP. \n“It’s not exactly contempt of court, but it certainly is contemptuous,” said Mr. Tribe, who taught two sitting Supreme Court justices as well as Mr. Obama — whom he later advised. \n“It conveys a lack of respect for the independent judiciary that bodes ill for the country's future as long as Trump occupies the presidency,” Mr. Tribe said. \n‘Big trouble!’ \nDemocrats in Congress were swift in their condemnation of Mr. Trump’s remarks, while Republicans notably did not rush to his defence. \n“This ‘so-called’ judge was nominated by a ‘so-called’ President & was confirmed by the ‘so-called’ Senate. Read the ‘so-called’ Constitution,” tweeted California Democratic lawmaker Adam Schiff. \nThe White House has argued that the travel bans are needed in order to prevent terror attacks on the United States. \nExperts from the fields of intelligence, counter-terrorism and diplomacy say the ban is at best ineffective and at worst fuels hatred of the United States in the Middle East. \nBut cracking down on Islamist terror has become an organizing principle for Mr. Trump’s supporters and the White House has consistently sought to underscore the risks posed to Americans. \nA recent Quinnipiac University poll showed 48 per cent of voters favoured “suspending immigration from ‘terror prone’ regions”. \n“When a country is no longer able to say who can, and who cannot , come in & out, especially for reasons of safety &.security — big trouble!” Mr. Trump tweeted on Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T09:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T05:03:39.827+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
