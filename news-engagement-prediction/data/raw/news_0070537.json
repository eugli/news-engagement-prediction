Wriddhiman Saha flies to pull off a stunner Wriddhiman Saha once again showed off his superlative wicketkeeping skills as he flew off the ground to take a sensational catch off the bowling of Umesh Yadav in India's first Test vs Australia in Pune. A + A - (Reuters Photo) \nThat Wriddhiman Saha is the best wicketkeeper in India has been a well-established fact and on Thursday he once again demonstrated his talent behind the stumps on Day 1 of the first Test against Australia in Pune. ( Scorecard ) \nIndia had Australia reeling at 205 for 7 with tail-enders Mitchell Starc and Steev O'Keefe on strike while Umesh Yadav was in the middle of a terrific spell, having already taken two wickets in the match. \nUmesh was getting the old ball to reverse and that was when he induced an edge off O'Keefe's bat and the ball flew past the stumps between the wicketkeeper and captain Virat Kohli at first slip. Saha, who has been flawless behind the stumps this whole season, was not one to let the ball go past him without giving it a shot. \nSaha flew (when we say flew, imagine Superman flying in those animated movies), to his right and plucked the ball out of thin air to complete one of the most stunning catches you would ever see. Thanks to Saha's brilliance, Umesh grabbed his third wicket and he added another to his tally the very next ball by trapping Nathan Lyon LBW to reduce Australia to 205 for 9. \nYou have to see it yourself to believe what Saha just pulled off. Even Kohli couldn't believe what he had just seen. His expression perfectly sums up Saha's catch. Unbelievable stuff!
