Thanks to our tipster, we now have learned that the company has begun testing the app which is called Touch ‘N Go Wallet for users in Taman Tun Dr. Ismail, Kuala Lumpur . \nHowever, TnG Wallet is not the mobile extension of the usual TnG cards that many of us owned. In fact, they are separate products altogether as users not able to utilize the credit balance within their TnG cards through TnG Wallet which has a separate credit reload mechanism of itself. \nFurthermore, TnG Wallet doesn’t share the same credentials as MyTouchnGo Portal (commonly used to manage TnG cards) and users are required to register a separate account for it. Additionally, the TnG Wallet app can’t be used for public transportation fares, toll charges, and parking payments. \nSo, what users can actually do with the TnG Wallet app then? According to the FAQ on the service’s official website, it can be used to top-up prepaid accounts, and utility bills payment as well as tickets from MBO Cinemas, and airline bookings through Airpaz – all from within the app itself. Couple Hacks Touch 'n Go; Goes On RM20,000 Spending Spree \nOther than that, users are also able to use TnG Wallet as payment method at selected merchants within Taman Tun Dr. Ismail. Do note that TnG has choose to implement QR code-based system for its TnG Wallet instead of NFC which might seems rather primitive and baffling given that the company already has experience with NFC since as early as 2012 but this should enable the app to be used on a wide variety of devices rather than being restricted to just smartphones with NFC. \nLast but not least, users are also able to transfer funds from their TnG Wallet balance to another user. Not to forget, the service also has its own loyalty program where users can obtain rewards through points that they accumulated from purchases using TnG Wallet. \nThe website stated that the live trial at TTDI will last until 20 April 2017 and residents within the area are welcomed to participate in the test by registering their details over here . All in all, it is a rather interesting venture by TnG but might open to confusion as users might deemed TnG Wallet as an app that can be used with their TnG cards rather than a totally separate payment tool.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T14:32:39.306+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
