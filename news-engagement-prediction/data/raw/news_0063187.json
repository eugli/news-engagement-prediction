It feels cruel to single out Ahmed Musa yet he was so ineffectual here, so out of touch with the game and badly at fault for the crucial opening goal. Other summer signings such as Papy Mendy and Bartosz Kapustka didn’t even make the squad. As Premier League winners they were presented with a one-off chance to recruit quality additions over the summer but it has been a huge opportunity missed. Musa, a £15million buy from CSKA Moscow, epitomises the poor planning and waste of money. \nMusa was poor for Leicester Turning point for Jamie Vardy? J amie Vardy provided the crucial lifeline 17 minutes from time and now needs to use this as the turning point in his difficult season. He has not managed a shot on target in the Premier League since December 17 yet his goal here was a predatory finish and Leicester have been missing those attacking instincts.\n380 - Jamie Vardy has scored with his first shot on target in 380 minutes for Leicester. Lifeline.\n— OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) February 22, 2017 H e will never match his amazing campaign last year but a few more goals this season could prove vital, as Leicester bid to avoid relegation.\nJamie Vardy scored his first goal in 748 minutes of football Sampaoli elevates Sevilla's game to different level T his was at times an embarrassingly one-sided affair and further evidence that Jorge Sampaoli has elevated Sevilla’s game to a different stratosphere.\nSampaoli is likely to leave at the end of the season, possibly for Barcelona, and his makeover of Sevilla was underlined here in a relentless performance. Dominant in possession, retrieving the ball back with devastating speed, they completely over-ran the English champions. Sevilla are only three points behind Real Madrid in third place and are genuine Champions League contenders, even if Sampaoli’s spell in Andalusia is going to be brief.\nJorge Sampaoli watches from up in the stands as Sevilla tore apart Leicester Man of the Match: Kasper Schmeichel I t was only a brilliant performance from Schmeichel that prevented a more chastening evening for Leicester. He produced at least three outstanding saves in the first half, and a penalty from Joaquin Correa, but finally conceded his first goal in 385 minutes in Europe. His heroics have given Leicester a chance of making further progress.\nSchmeichel saved a spot kick in the first half What next for Sevilla... S evilla will face Real Betis away on Saturday and remain in contention for the La Liga title but they will regret not killing off this tie. Their hopes of advancing to the quarter-finals are now not as straightforward.\nWhat next for Leicester... Leicester were desperately searching for a turning point and Vardy’s goal could prove pivotal in their season. They face Liverpool on Monday night and will be aiming to take the final 25 minutes of this game as encouragement.\nLeicester can take heart from the final 25 minutes against Sevilla", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:19:56.746+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
