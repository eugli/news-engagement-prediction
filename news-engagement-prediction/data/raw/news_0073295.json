The sheriff's office said a man in his 20s was found dead around 1 p.m., while four others were transported to UF Health Jacksonville -- one taken in for surgery, and three with minor injuries. \nAt press time, it is unclear whether the shots were fired at the event or by someone driving by, and the victims' names have not been released. \nBoosie announced his video shoot on Instagram shortly before it was set to begin. A promo image stated: \"Shoot starts at 12 noon in front of Holley's Bar B Q\" on Saturday. He has since posted other updates on social media, though none reference the reported shooting. \nBillboard reached out to a rep for Boosie, who declined to comment.
