T+L Newsletters \nA visit to Las Vegas is not complete without a bit of casual debauchery. \nGuests at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Las Vegas can now pop bottles of champagne straight from a vending machine. \nA few months ago, the hotel opened a Moët & Chandon vending machine serving up mini-bottles of champagne on the hotel’s 23rd floor at the Sky Lobby. \nThe machine dispenses miniature bottles of champagne (they hold about a glass and a half), along with miniature flutes for impromptu toasts. It’s expertly engineered so champagne bottles are dispensed without having been shaken by delivery—which means no surprise champagne bursts upon opening. \nThe machine has a capacity for 320 mini bottles of champagne. Guests can choose between Moet’s Imperial Brut or Imperial Rose. \nIn order to get to the bubbly, guests must first purchase a $20 gold coin at the front desk (and prove they’re at least 21 years old), which comes emblazoned with the Moët logo.
