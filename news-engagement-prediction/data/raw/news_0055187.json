[nL4N1G71SI] \nMalaysia’s police chief Khalid Abu Bakar said both officials were in Malaysia but could not confirm if they were in the North Korean embassy. \nSo far, police have identified a total of eight North Koreans suspected of being linked to the killing. One is in custody. \nMalaysia has denied North Korea’s request for the body to be handed over to its embassy directly, saying it would be released to the next of kin, although none has come forward. \nThe KCNA report accused Malaysia of breaking international law by conducting autopsies on a person bearing a diplomatic passport. \n(Reporting by Jack Kim and Christine Kim; Editing by Grant McCool and Paul Tait) Share This:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:52:27.954+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
