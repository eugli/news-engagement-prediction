Fewer than a dozen were found this weekend, according to Emerson-Franklin Reeve Greg Janzen, although he suspected the drop might have to do with a plunge in the mercury.\n\"I haven't heard of any big groups coming across and I'm wondering if maybe it's the weather, because I know they're still coming,\" Janzen said Sunday, noting the temperature in the area Saturday night dipped to about --14 C.\nRCMP in Surrey, B.C., said that a man and a woman who were tentatively identified as Turkish nationals were arrested and turned over to immigration officials after they crossed the border and entered Canada without reporting to a port of entry.\nThe RCMP, the Canada Border Services Agency and public safety officials are analyzing the influx, added Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, who said most of the asylum seekers intended to eventually end up in Canada, rather than the U.S.\n\"The vast majority . . . are actually transiting through the United States,\" Goodale said in an interview on Global TV's The West Block.\n\"Their plan was not originally to be in the United States, but to come through the United States.\"\nBut the minister couldn't say why people are choosing to cross illegally from the U.S. if their goal was always to end up on Canadian soil or elsewhere.\nREAD MORE: MPs visit Emerson as Public Safety Minister plans meeting with Homeland Security Secretary \nUnder the Safe Third Country Agreement between Canada and the U.S., refugee claimants in one country can't make the same claim on the other side of the border. But that only applies when they make claims at official border crossings.\nIf asylum seekers reach Canadian territory, they are entitled to go through a claims process after being arrested because Canada is a signatory of the U.N Refugee Convention.\nShould their claim be rejected, they could be returned to their country of citizenship.\nThe risks of crossing illegally, highlighted by two claimants from Ghana who had their fingers amputated after suffering severe frostbite as they crossed into Canada, have led the federal New Democrats and some refugee advocates to call on the government to suspend the agreement.\nBut Hussen noted the U.S. asylum system is monitored by American courts and has no bearing on government-resettled refugees.\nFormer Conservative immigration minister Jason Kenney agreed, calling the U.S. system \"fair, just (and) independent.\"\nStill, the exemption that allows people to enter Canada illegally to make a refugee claim is a loophole that should be closed, Kenney told CTV.\nThe loophole is providing an incentive for people to come in illegally and dangerously,\" said Kenney, who is seeking to lead Alberta's Progressive Conservative party.\n\"We want regular, safe, legal migration, not unsafe illegal migration.\"\nPhotos In an interview with CTV's Question Period, Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen said, for now, Ottawa is monitoring the situation, but added it's still too early to say whether even more asylum seekers will continue walking over Canada's doorstep.
