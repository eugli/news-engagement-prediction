Key points: Meat processors taking the hit Consumers could soon be paying more for lamb One million fewer lambs expected to be killed Wool prices up, farmers retaining ewes \nAnd today, Manildra Meatworks, in the small regional New South Wales town of Cootamundra will close indefinitely. \nAdministrator of the Cootamundra-Gundagai council, Christine Ferguson, said it had already had a big impact on the town. \n\"I mean, [in] a small town of 7,500 people, the loss of 220 jobs in that size town has a huge effect,\" she said. \n\"I don't know the figures but I would think it would be like losing 1,000 jobs in say, Sydney or Melbourne.\" Record prices at saleyards to blame for lamb shortage \nBeef prices rocketed last year and lamb has followed. \nMeat processors are taking the hit, but consumers could soon be paying more too. \nCanberra butcher Phil Whitney said he might have to increase his prices in the next fortnight, if the price at the saleyards did not drop. \n\"Last week when I bought lambs the price increased by $650,\" he said. \n\"At the moment [the price for consumers] will be an increase of probably by a dollar per kilo but not for another couple of weeks to see what the market stays at.\" Meat processors under pressure \nAt the saleyards, lambs are being sold for record highs of more than 750 cents per kilogram. \nMeat and Livestock Australia's chief economist Ben Thomas said a shortage of lambs being sent to slaughter was causing the price rises. \nHe expects the number of lambs killed this year will be one million fewer than last, as farmers capitalise on good seasonal conditions and rebuild their flocks after drought. \n\"On top of that, wool prices are really good at the moment so that's acting as another reason for producers to want to retain ewes, which is conversely meaning there's fewer coming through the saleyards and also being processed,\" he said. \n\"Meat processors are taking the hit.\" \nRoger Fletcher, who has abattoirs in regional New South Wales and Western Australia, said businesses had to accept that it was a \"tough\" industry. \n\"I do the numbers and it's unsustainable where we're at,\" he said. \n\"It's a bit like if there are six hotels in a town and there's only enough room for five drinkers, one's got to close. And there'll be more close.\" \nHe is optimistic there will be a reprieve, as is Peter Greenham, who processes beef in Tasmania. \n\"If [price fluctuations] don't happen then you don't get that cycle of rebuilding and getting the cattle numbers back to where they need to be, or the sheep numbers back to where they need to be,\" Mr Greenham said. \n\"You also get producers making extra money and investing back in their farms and able to produce a better product at the end of the day,\" he said. \nGraziers could not be happier with the high prices. \n\"It's extraordinary the prices we're getting,\" said Paul Martin, from Cassilis. \n\"It's something we've never seen before in our lives.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:34:26.919+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
