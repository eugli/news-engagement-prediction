SHOP N SAVE SCAM AT BEDOK CENTRAL   Wed, 01/02/2017 - 4:13pm \nDear A.S.S. Editor \nOn 01/02/2017 at around 1:10 PM at a coffeehouse near Bedok Central NTUC. I and my family was sitting down at a table after doing some tiring shopping for our groceries. We were having drinks chatting away, suddenly a lady from nowhere came to us and wanted to do a survey. Advertisement \nMy mom swiftly gave a green light although i signaled her not to do so. The lady sat down, started to surveyed us about our home income, our life, our career, how is our employer treating us. Then the lady said, she will give us a Shop N Save store vouchers. Suddenly it ringed a bell in my mom's head. The store shop and save was closed down already. the lady said, she will give $100 vouchers, in order to get that, the lady said, we must pay deposit of $300 in order to get the vouchers. \nImmediately, we know this is a scam. We told her to get lost, she forced us even more to pay her to get the vouchers. We finally tell her, that we will call the police if she do not leave. Finally she left. \nMy advise is, please beware of this new scam around. \nMr Joseph \nA.S.S. Contributor Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
