The metaphor certainly applies to Don Jose, the hapless soldier and mamas’s boy who falls under Carmen’s spell and ultimately will pay dearly for his entanglement with her. \nThe velvety Russian mezzo-soprano Ekaterina Gubanova avoids all the cliches. Not only does she tap into Carmen’s blatant admission that she loves only for the moment — that love is “a wild bird that cannot be imprisoned” — but she moves like a dream, and can make a fan feel more dangerous than a dagger. And as her Don Jose, the Malta-born tenor Joseph Calleja uses his rich, warm voice and Brando-like looks to effortlessly suggest his character’s emotional weakness and constant ambivalence. \nThere also is an extraordinarily beautiful performance by Eleanora Buratto (the Italian soprano who left such a fine impression when she performed in “Falstaff” with the CSO last year). As Micaela, the woman of great inner strength who adores Don Jose (and cares for his mother, who has chosen her as her son’s bride-to-be), Buratto sings with great heart, and the aria in which she stands alone and addresses her fears is nothing less than show-stopping. \nChristian Van Horn, the stately American bass-baritone, brings just the right casual arrogance and sense of entitlement to the role of Escamillo, the toreador who catches Carmen’s eye. Particularly outstanding in the roles of Carmen’s girlfriends are soprano Diana Newman (as Frasquita) and mezzo Lindsay Metzger (as Mercedes), whose vocal prowess also is matched by their ability to move with great style. The 12 seductive dancers who suggest everything from a slow motion tango to an erotically charged bullfight are a reminder of how crucial dance can be as a storytelling element in opera. The dashing bass-baritone Bradley Smoak possesses just the right haughty elegance as Lieutenant Zuniga. And there is splendid singing by Takaoki Onishi, and by Emmett O’Hanlon and Mingjie Lei, as two revolutionaries who operate from a mountain hideaway. \nEarly on, the gathering of the male chorus waiting for the female tobacco factory workers to take a break is expertly realized, and watching the female section of the chorus blow smoke into the air with confident abandon is priceless, as Carmen proclaims that all lovers’ words are as ephemeral as smoke. The Chicago Children’s Chorus, whose exquisite voices are matched by sophisticated dancing skills, fills the stage with great merriment and panache, particularly in an early scene in which they mimic the battalion of soldiers who patrol Seville. \nThe final stabbing, which moves from sexual mauling to violence, could use a bit of polish. But the outcome here is never in doubt. As Carmen tells us, it’s all in the cards, and she impulsively plays her own hand till the bitter end. Ole! \nNote: Beginning March 16, Anita Rachvelishvili will assume the role of Carmen, Brandon Jovanovich will sing Don Jose and Ainars Rubikis will conduct.
