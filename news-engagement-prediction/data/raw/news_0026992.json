TIM MCGINN \nA helicopter fills a monsoon bucket from a small pond near Sugarloaf on the Port Hills. \nParts of the Early Valley Rd fire had crossed Summit Rd towards Governors Bay on Tuesday, but homes in the area are no longer believed to be at risk. \nA helicopter fighting the fires crashed near Sugarloaf about 2.50pm on Tuesday. Police confirmed the pilot, a man had died. \nUp to 15 helicopters had been fighting the blaze, and all had been grounded following the crash. Pilots were given the option to return to the skies in the evening, with some choosing not to take to the skies following the crash. JOHN KIRK-ANDERSON/FAIRFAX NZ \nFire burning down towards Governors Bay from Summit Rd. Ohinetahi homestead can be seen at the bottom of the image. \nThe blazes, which both started on Monday, had spread over 600 hectares. It was expected firefighters would be needed for another two or three days. \nThe Selwyn District Council said the Marley Hill fire appeared to be largely contained on the city side of Summit Rd by 3pm. \nMarshall said the fire had damaged about 548 hectares on Early Valley Rd about about 36 hectares on Marley Hill. GEORGE HEARD/FAIRFAX NZ \nThe blazes could take days to finally put out. \n\"We've had one house lost, another slightly damaged, a number of outbuildings and there's been a significant amount of vegetation.\" \nGovernors Bay resident Tony Edney said on Tuesday he could see the fire burning vigorously along the upper slopes of the Port Hills and along the east side of Mt Ada, above Ella's Track. \nHe thought the top of the Ohinetahi Reserve had been affected and said the fire seemed to be heading towards the Sign of the Bellbird.

There's ash falling all around an a think smoke haze, it's giving us headaches.\" \n\"It's a pretty catastrophic event for everyone,\" he said. \nBoth fires had burned through over 600 hectares of scrub, destroying at least one home and several sheds, closing multiple roads, and cutting power to 50 houses. A second house was slightly damaged by fire. All affected structures were in the Landsdowne area. ALDEN WILLIAMS/Stuff.co.nz \nSuperintendent Lane Todd speaks to the media on Tuesday. \nIt was understood the Landsdowne fire was related to an electrical fault and was not being treated as suspicious. \nA Selwyn District Council spokesman said he did not know the cause of the fire, but a fire investigator would work to determine the cause. \nOVERNIGHT EVACUATIONS GEORGE HEARD/FAIRFAX NZ \nScorched earth and burnt debris on Christchurch's Port Hills in the wake of huge fires. \nTwenty-four homes had to be evacuated overnight, and a group of children were among those rescued on Monday after becoming stuck near one of the fires. \nSelwyn principal rural fire officer Douglas Marshall said 11 helicopters and nearly 120 firefighters were working to contain the fires on Tuesday, and could be needed for another two or three days. Three two-member firefighting crews from the New Zealand Army had also been dispatched to help. \n\"The second fire . . . [at Marleys Hill] is working around the radio mast that's up in that area. It's currently working down a ridge it's probably the top end of the [Christchurch] Adventure Park area,\" Marshall said.

Tai Tapu School had been available for those needing somewhere to go, but had closed before midnight. \nRoad closures are still in place for Early Valley Rd, Old Tai Tapu Rd between Osterholts Rd and State Highway 75, and Summit Rd between Dyers Pass and Rapaki Track on Tuesday. \nDyers Pass Rd is also closed between Hackthorne and Governors Bay roads, and will remain closed on Wednesday.
