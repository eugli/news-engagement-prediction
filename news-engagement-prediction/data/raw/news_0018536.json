Armed with bottles of green juice, bowls of warm oatmeal and berries, and cups of full-fat yogurt, the women had come together for a moment of pause to nourish, meditate, and talk about wellness at a gathering sponsored by the CFDA Health Initiative . Leading the conversation were nutrition specialist Dr. Jeffrey Morrison, sleep psychologist Dr. Jennifer Martin, and model Carolyn Murphy. As Morrison and Martin spoke on the importance of establishing a regular sleeping schedule and meal times, Murphy gently interjected. For models, she said, “having a routine is super difficult,” acknowledging the difficulties of navigating the peripatetic industry. “The lifestyle is nomadic; you’re always on an airplane, living out of a suitcase,” she said, confessing that this month alone, she has spent countless hours in flight between New York and Los Angeles. In her 40s, Murphy is an emblem of what a long, impactful, healthy career in the modeling industry can look like. And yet as a rising star on the fashion scene in the ’90s, she experienced the havoc that an overpacked schedule and one too many Champagne-swilling after-parties can wreak firsthand. It took time, she says, to learn to prioritize her well-being and her body, “which was going into the burnout phase by the time I was 23.” Of course, you don’t have to be a supermodel to need help navigating the rigors of today’s whirlwind work pace or the dangers of digital overload. For anyone with a demanding career, health requires a personal rethinking. Here, Murphy shares her six tips for establishing a lifetime of good habits, no matter where you travel and when you sleep. Pack an In-Flight Rescue Kit “No red-eyes,” says Murphy, who would rather show up to a new time zone fully rested than chance an abbreviated night of sleep to kick off a trip. Not that she won’t take the opportunity to snooze on an afternoon flight. Murphy’s carry-on is stocked with an “emergency kit” of a silk eye mask and earplugs. Even if they’re not deployed mid-flight, “You never know if your hotel room is going to be noisy,” she reasons. Take Time to Wind Down Before Bed Wherever she is in the world, Murphy has a better chance of falling asleep when she takes the time to decompress before bed in familiar ways. “I always travel with Epsom salts,” she says. She also recommends packing a favorite candle or incense, and a good, relaxing book to read before turning out the lights. “Don’t look at your phone,” she says, sometimes going so far as to request her room be taken off Wi-Fi to resist the temptation, and opt for calming reading material rather than adrenaline-pumping The Girl on the Train thrillers. Don’t Try to Beat Jet Lag Hydration is your best defense against jet lag, and alcohol and caffeine will only contribute to exacerbating the effects of a time difference. Murphy avoids alcohol all together, and for restless nights, sleeping pills, too, are “no bueno.” You don’t want to build a reliance on a pill, she explains, though she admittedly occasionally reaches for a melatonin supplement when jet lag nudges her awake in the middle of the night. Rather than looking at the clock and counting the hours until she wakes up, Murphy smoothly transitions back to a sleep state by trying to recall the dream she was just having. Eat Seasonally and Locally For staying healthy in the winter, Murphy makes a point of “carving out that time on a Sunday to make a huge pot of bone broth.” Chock-full of nutrients, healthy fats, and with additions of veggies, it’s a warm remedy to sip on throughout the cold months. When it comes to snacking, whole foods are the simplest way to stay healthy in life and in travel. Instead of raiding the minibar for an all-too-tempting Snickers, Murphy reaches for an apple paired with her go-to packets of Justin’s Classic Almond Butter. “They’re so easy to carry around.” And always look for food and smoothies supplemented by healthy and filling fats including avocados, coconut cream, butter, and Murphy’s favorite, ghee. “It keeps your blood sugar levels consistent,” for sustained energy throughout the day. Supercharge Your System With Supplements A trifecta of supplements, including vitamin C, echinacea, and a probiotic for a reinforced immune system, can keep you in good form all year long [cut:, says Dr. Morrison, who recommends vitamin C, echinacea, and a probiotic for a reinforced immune system]. For her part, Murphy favors UltraFlora Immune Booster Probiotics to regulate her digestive system. Reset Your Head A longtime believer in meditation, Murphy has found a mantra to clear her thoughts. But the ancient practice, she recognizes, is a personal path. “Use whatever works for you—staring at a flame, listening to calming music.” No matter the method, allowing yourself to just be for a moment is perhaps the healthiest thing you can do in a day.
