Aliyeva professed to be humbled by the appointment. “Mr. President, I express my deep gratitude to you for this high confidence in me,” she said at a meeting of the Security Council. “Over the past years, your ideas of statehood, patriotism, your courageous protection of Azerbaijan’s national interests, and your unity with the people of Azerbaijan were an example for me.” \n\n\nIs this the biggest power move ever? This Azerbaijani President just casually creating a brand new law that lets him appoint his wife as VP of the country. The first VP in the history of Azerbaijan. He literally invented the position for her. The best part is he did it a day before his anniversary too. Now that’s a fucking present. And how about the standing ovation from his cabinet on live TV? Imagine if somebody didn’t stand. That’s an instant execution. Meanwhile back in America I still got Stoolies complaining about me bringing in Hammy for 1 facebook live a month ago. Pussy makes you do crazy things son. El Presidente |", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:49:46.755+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
