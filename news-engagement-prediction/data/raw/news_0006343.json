And for 2017, they will be filling their expensive 60 seconds with a short film called \"Born The Hard Way.\" The spot tells the story of founder Adolphus Busch, who immigrated from Germany to St. Louis in 1857 in pursuit of his American dream—creating the perfect beer. The brand's commercial comes at quite a significant time—just a few days after President Donald Trump 's recent executive order went into effect. The order prohibits immigrants from seven North African and Middle Eastern countries from entering the United States for 90 days. It also bars all refugees from U.S. entry for 120 days, and indefinitely prevents Syrian refugees from entering the country. Budweiser and its producer Anheuser-Busch have not publicly commented about the executive order, but the commercial and the pro-immigration stance it promotes speak louder than words. \"Our focus this week is on our Super Bowl ads and our brands,\" Marcel Marcondes, vice president of marketing at Anheuser-Busch, tells SELF in a statement. \"We created the Budweiser commercial to highlight the ambition of our founder, Adolphus Busch, and his unrelenting pursuit of the American dream. This is a story about our heritage and the uncompromising commitment that goes into brewing our beer. It’s an idea we’ve been developing along with our creative agency for nearly a year.” A century and a half after its conception, Adolphus Busch's family is still involved in the company. “Adolphus would be proud to know we are continuing to celebrate his legacy and his relentless pursuit to create the most iconic beer brand in the world,” said Steven Busch, Adolphus Busch's great-great-grandson. “It's an honor to follow in his footsteps in the beer business. He lived the American dream and his perseverance, hard work and unwavering commitment to quality laid the foundation for the success of Budweiser and this great company.” The commercial will air at a Super Bowl party near you on Sunday, February 5, but in the meantime, here it is on YouTube: Loading", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T05:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:28:52.668+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
