Luckily, this week Sweden's Twitter account is fact-checking President Donald Trump , especially when it comes to his claims about the country. \nOn Saturday, Trump caused a lot of confusion when he talked about an incident in Sweden from the night before. He was going off about immigration once again, referencing terrorist attacks in foreign countries, when he mentioned Sweden . However, representatives from Sweden didn't know what Trump was talking about. \nLater, Trump took to Twitter to explain that he had heard about Sweden on Fox News . Eventually it was deducted that he had watched Tucker Carlson interview filmmaker Ami Horowitz , who claims that authorities in Sweden are trying to cover up a crime wave caused by refugees. \nNow Sweden's Twitter account is taking Trump to task for his comments about Sweden, immigration, and other topics. You see, Sweden has a really cool system for running their social media in which each week a different citizen gets to take over the account. This week our trusty advisor on things Sweden is Max Karlsson, a 22-year-old who mentions in his bio that he is a \"huge nerd\" who \"likes facts.\" \nOn Monday, his first day at the helm, he decided to go through the reasons why the claims about Sweden's crime were incorrect. Let's be clear: a lot happened #lastnightinsweden . Things happen all of the time. Just not the things @realdonaldtrump are spreading.
