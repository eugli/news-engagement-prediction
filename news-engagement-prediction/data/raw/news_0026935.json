Lopez wore a lilac Ralph & Russo gown with a plunging keyhole neckline and thigh high slit. CBS CBS \nEarlier in the show, Corden brought out Neil Diamond for a fun, star-studded performance of his hit \"Sweet Caroline\" designed to look like his Late Late Show 's Carpool Karaoke segment. \nJ.Lo joined them and the likes of Faith Hill and husband Tim McGraw , John Legend , Jason Derulo , Keith Urban , Ryan Tedder and Beyoncé and Jay Z 's 5-year-old daughter Blue Ivy Carter .
