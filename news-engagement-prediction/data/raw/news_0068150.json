The mother-daughter duo, who hail from Bogotá, Colombia, team up to create costumes that portray famous women. As a fashion designer, Peña developed the idea for the Instagram account when Ana was even younger.\n“I choose to stay home with Ana to take care of her, and that was a decision I made with my husband. At the beginning, it was a lot of free time because she was napping a lot because she was a baby. Then she grew, and she was enjoying it a lot,” she tells Yahoo Style on the evolution of the account. “She was saying, ‘I want this and I want that!’ She really loved posing for the pictures. One day I found a book for kids, and it was telling stories of great women of the world.”\nAna has since dressed up as a number of notable women of history and pop culture who’ve made great contributions to society. In her most recent post, on Monday, Peña made a mini-version of  Emma Watson ‘s look from the Paris premiere of the Beauty and the Beast . The caption notes that the actress’s custom Louis Vuitton dress was created from used plastic bottles.\n\n\nPeña “loves” Watson because she’s “a role model that I want for my kid who teaches girls that they can be intelligent, and that beauty is not only what you can see with your eyes but something that’s in your soul.”\nThe dress Daniela created for her daughter looks incredibly similar to Watson’s  Louis Vuitton  frock designed by the creative director of the house,  Nicolas Ghesquière . Peña’s creation appeared to impress Ghesquière, as he liked the three posts she shared of her daughter wearing the homemade piece.\nWatson’s stylist, Rebecca Corbin-Murray, also appeared to love the re-creation. She posted the image  with the caption, ”  Major fashionista in the making! Never too young to love fashion — and never too young to care about where your clothes come from and who made them!” \nIn the past, Ana has channeled others who are making an impact in the fashion industry. In early February, the 3-year-old sported a blond wig, black sunglasses, and a sleek black coat with white sandals to mirror Anna Wintour , the editor in chief of Vogue .\n\n\nShe dressed up as another Vogue icon — the magazine’s creative director at large and renowned stylist,  Grace Coddington — a month before.\n\n\nFor this costume, she slipped on a rather large red wig — similar to Coddington’s signature untamed mane — and a black jacket.\nAnother fashion figure Ana has emulated? Jackie Kennedy . In December 2016, Ana wore a red peacoat with a matching hat and white gloves that matched Kennedy’s Oleg Cassini suit worn in 1961.\n\n\nAna also copied Rosa Parks’s famous booking photo from her February 1956 arrest, with her hair pulled up in braids and wearing oversize glasses.\n\n\n“ This wonderful woman is Rosa Parks she was a very influential leader and I admire that she continued to fight for a better life for future generations until the day she passed,” the caption reads.  \nMexican painter Frida Kahlo was another hit costume on the account.\n\n\n“I told Ana the story of Frida, and she loved the story because when Frida was a little girl she was very different from the other girls. That made her feel so special,” Peña explains to Yahoo Style. “When I told Ana the story, she loved it and told me she wanted to dress like Frida. So I did it.”\nPeña teaches her daughter about each of the people she dresses up as. “I tried to choose people that were really inspiring — the stories of really empowering women,” Peña says. “That’s what I want for my kid. I started to think of course we love Disney princesses, but I don’t want her to think that the only role model she can have is to be a princess.” She continues, “I want her to think that she can be more like Princess Leia — she can be against the empire and fight with the rebels, things like that.”\n\n\nAna’s favorite character so far? Rey, the great fictional female lead from Star Wars: The Force Awakens .\n“She’s always asking to dress like Princess Leia because we’ve seen the movie three times. She loves Star Wars ,” Peña said.\nRead More \n\nConsidering Peña loves strong female characters, Mayim Bialik , an accomplished actress and neuroscientist, was another fitting costume choice. Ana dressed up as Bialik’s character, Amy Farrah Fowler, from The Big Bang Theory .\n\n\n“ We live in a world where girls can assume a number of roles, so here is a person that truly embodies brains and beauty.  @missmayim is a mom, neuroscientist, actress and role model,” Peña wrote in the caption.  \nOther costumes have included iconic female characters in history, like Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz .\n\n\nThe duo really enjoys the process. “We also do costumes just for fun. She loves Toy Story and all the Pixar movies.”\n\n\nPeña is excited about her daughter’s future costumes. “We’re working on the yellow dress from Beauty and the Beast because the new Belle princess is going to be an inventor,” she says. “She has a real occupation and she’s really smart, and I love that about her and that’s why I’m going to make that dress for her.”\nRead More: \nInstagram Is Good for People With Insecurities and Depression, Says Study \nA Look Back at Outrageous Oscars Style — and Why It Would Never Happen Today \n\nFollow us on Instagram , Facebook , and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T05:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T03:46:04.956+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
