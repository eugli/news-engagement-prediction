The San Antonio Board of Realtors and the Austin Board of Realtors have put together an eight person task force, hired a private consultant and are doing due diligence to evaluate if a merge is worth pursuing. Paul Hilgers is CEO of the Austin Board of Realtors and Angela Shields is president and… more Arnold Wells/Staff San Antonio Board of Realtors CEO Angela Shields and Austin Board of Realtors CEO Paul Hilgers both confirmed the two associations were in the middle of confidential negotiations, but Hilgers said it \"isn't a done deal by any stretch.\" Consolidation across the industry and floods of development along the I-35 corridor pushed the idea forward, and Hilgers said the two associations began serious discussions of a potential merge back in July 2016. \"We believe regionalization in the Austin and San Antonio areas make sense, and this is an effort to be proactive about our future,\" Hilgers said. \"It's really about looking at the economy of scale, and it's no secret that the I-35 corridor and that Austin and San Antonio businesses are coming together.\" The idea is still in the feasibility phase and is years away from any type of implementation. Considering the shrinking gap between the San Antonio and Austin markets and the expanding overlap among businesses operating in both cities, a single MLS system could make sense. Across the country, a handful of realtor associations have merged their systems in order to make it more efficient for realtors working in multiple areas. Hilgers said the top 40 MLS systems are responsible for 80 percent of the national realtor membership. The other 650 to 700 systems make up a small, tiny group that's \"hanging on to their operations.\" \"We're seeing this push to figure out how to survive in the long term,\" he said. \"There's a lot of other things happening in the industry. We're proud that we're too associations that want to take control of our own destiny, but both of us are in no danger of going out of business.\" There is still a lot the two associations need to figure out before they make any final decisions. The most important of which is what value San Antonio and Austin's respective boards bring to the table. \"Before we make any final decision, we will know what the values are and will structure our future based on the contributions and the outputs of both organizations,\" Hilgers said. \"We will make sure the value is equitable.\" It has been more than six months since the two associations got serious about the possibility of a single system, and so far, Shields said neither of the two parties have come up with anything that is a deal breaker. However, that doesn't mean anything will happen overnight. \"This is a process that will take a while, and we want to make sure this is something we in fact want to do,\" Shields said. \"There's no template for how to go about doing this.\" Katie Burke covers residential and commercial real estate, retail and law firms for the paper Related Content", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:34:46.486+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
