'Digital transformation' \nHSBC makes most of its money outside the UK and in Asia accounts for the bulk of bank's global pre-tax profit. \nIts bank's shares are listed in London, Paris, New York and Hong Kong. \nHSBC had revealed plans earlier in the year to shut a further 62 bank branches in the UK in 2017 , due to growth in mobile and internet banking which means many of its customers now conduct their transactions via the internet or on smartphones. The bank closed 223 UK branches last year. \nGroup Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver said the bank was investing more than $2bn in \"digital transformation initiatives to improve our offer to customers\".
