It's a game that I will always remember,\" Cedric told the club's website.

Soares challenges France's Antoine Griezmann in the Euro 2016 final \n\"Of course, we have a little less responsibility for the game than Manchester United. They are a very big name in football. Everybody knows about them,\" he added. \n\"They have great players and a great squad, with a great coach. But we must prepare for the game and believe in what we do...we have players who can make a difference.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T17:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T12:55:42.172+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
