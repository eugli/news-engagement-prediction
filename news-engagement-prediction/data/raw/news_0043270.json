(ABC Adelaide: Brett Williamson) \n\"Other places have what we call a spring neap cycle, but in Adelaide the neap tides are quite weak and several times a year the tide [movement] almost disappears.\" \nMr Chittleborough said other locations around the world had similar water height changes as a dodge tide but their natural variations were not as high as in the Gulf St Vincent. \n\"In Adelaide, we have quite substantial tides of several metres [normally],\" he said. \n\"Normally we are used to [around] two metres of tide going up and down each day. \n\"It's quite noticeable here and has effects on shipping and so forth.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T12:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T07:56:49.163+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
