The critically acclaimed film took home seven awards, including best director, best actor and actress in a musical or comedy, and best musical or comedy. And while the movie’s music has been receiving a lot of attention (yes, it also took home the award for best original song), much of the joy of watching La La Land stems from the film’s visual intensity. As a meditation on nostalgia and an ode to old-time Hollywood movies like Singin’ in the Rain , La La Land employs a Technicolor palette to great effect. One of the most pleasing early such instances comes when Emma Stone ’s character, Mia, and her roommates are getting ready for a night out. The four women end up wearing dresses in bright, contrasting colors to a party in the Hills. But their apartment more than sets the stage, brimming with invitingly quirky items around every corner. From the pink-and-white-striped couch–slash–dance floor to the Ingrid Bergman poster in Mia’s bedroom, this set serves a few key purposes. Above, a look inside the apartment, plus a few pieces to help you get the look in your own home.
