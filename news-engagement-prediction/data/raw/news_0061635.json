Kevin Mazur via Getty Images \nBeyoncé is making her voice heard when it comes to rights for the LGBTQ community. \nOn Wednesday, the Trump administration announced it will be rolling back protections put in place by the Obama administration that barred schools from discriminating against transgender students . The previous policy stated that schools receiving federal money must treat a student’s gender identity as his or her sex, which includes using the restroom of his or her gender identity. \nBeyoncé shared a message in support of LGBTQ youth, along with a link to GLSEN’s 100 Days of Kindness challenge. GLSEN is a group that works to ensure the safety of LGBTQ students in schools. \nGLSEN’s 100 Days of Kindness is an initiative to build a virtual “wall of kindness” with messages of support and reassurance for LGBTQ students. \nSince the election, we’ve seen an increase in reports of harassment, bullying, and violence towards LGBTQ students in schools. Now with a new administration in office, there’s growing anxiety among LGBTQ students about what they might face. \nThe group is thankful for Beyoncé’s message. \n“We are so thrilled that Beyoncé is standing up for transgender youth by joining GLSEN’s 100 Days of Kindness Campaign at this very difficult time,” executive director Dr. Eliza Byard said in a statement to The Huffington Post. “There is a great deal of confusion and fear out there right now, and Beyoncé has the unique power to cut through the noise to deliver a crucial message of love and support to all transgender youth. Thank you, Beyoncé. (And I cannot wait to tell my daughters about your support.)” \nThis is not the first time the “Lemonade” singer has stood up for this issue. Back in May, she spoke out against North Carolina’s anti-LGBT bathroom bill by stressing the need to support groups that promote equality and justice. \nOther celebrities spoke out for transgender kids this week following the White House’s decision. For anyone who feels scared or hopeless, know that we will never stop fighting for your rights. — Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) February 23, 2017 We need to protect trans youth and stand up against this cruelty that hurts our kids.
