However, legislation sponsored by Illinois Senate Minority Leader Christine Radogno (R-Lemont) would end workers’ compensation benefits for professional athletes when they turn 35, unless they can prove their expected playing career would last longer than that. \nSmith told the Spiegel & Parkins Show on Friday that the bill is being pushed by the McCaskey family. \n“This bill being sponsored by Ms. Radogno is simply designed to target professional athletes, and take away their right to health care that every worker in the state of Illinois is entitled to,” Smith told the Spiegel & Parkins Show. \n“The Bears’ owners are behind it as well, to be blunt, it’s just another way to bankroll the coffers of the rich owners who own these teams at the expense of the players who actually do all the work. … They’re pushing the bill. Our understanding is they are the people who have lined up a lobbyist to promote the bill.” \nThe Bears released a statement to 670 The Score. \n“We join the four other major professional Chicago teams in monitoring and supporting changes to the system that protect athletes’ rights under the workers’ compensation system while acknowledging athletes are not competing professionally until age 67. Nothing in the wage differential language under consideration impacts the right for any athlete to receive just compensation for partial or permanent injury, medical benefits or to file a claim itself.” \nSmith described the bill as “just a chicken-scratch thing thrown into the budget at the last minute.” He also referred to previous cases similar to this one around the league. \n“Its only effect is to hurt people who get hurt for a living,” Smith added. “…It’s just cheapness. It’s just being cheap.” \nShould this bill pass, Smith and the NFLPA plan to sway players from signing with the Bears. \n“I will tell you from the bottom of my heart that this union will tell every potential free agent player, if this bill passes, to not come to the Bears,” Smith said. “Because, think about it, if you’re a free agent player and you have an opportunity to go play somewhere else where you can get lifetime medical for the injury you’re going to have, isn’t a smarter financial decision to go to a team where a bill like this hasn’t passed?” \nChris Emma covers the Bears, Chicago’s sports scene and more for CBSChicago.com.
