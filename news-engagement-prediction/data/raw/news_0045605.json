Our laws should be enforced. @MichelleRempel \n— @TonyclementCPC Rempel's message was posted after Manitoba RCMP announced that another 22 people were intercepted crossing the border near Emerson on Saturday night.\nOfficials have said a growing number of people are choosing to walk across the border into Canada to claim refugee status, including dozens who have been arrested in the Emerson area in recent weeks.\nRCMP bracing for more border crossers amid community concerns Other provinces including Quebec have also seen a large rise in the number of refugee claimants who enter the province irregularly.\nThe tactic is a way to avoid the Canada-U.S. Safe Third Country Agreement , which prevents most people who have been living in the United States from making a refugee claim at an official border crossing on the premise that they are already somewhere safe.\nCanada-U.S. Safe Third Country Agreement Number of asylum-seekers crossing illegally into Quebec from U.S. spikes This has prompted some people to cross elsewhere in order to make their claims from within Canada, where authorities generally grant them a hearing.\nMontreal immigration lawyer Eric Taillefer said the easiest way to stop the irregular border crossings is to suspend the Safe Third Country Agreement and allow people to request refugee status at official border crossings.\n\"These people are not crossing in the winter in -30 degree weather for fun — they're doing it because they don't have a choice,\" he said in a phone interview.\nMinister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Ahmed Hussen during Question Period in the House of Commons in Ottawa, Tuesday, Jan.31, 2017. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press)\nNo plans to suspend agreement, Ottawa says A spokesperson for Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen said Ottawa wasn't planning to suspend the agreement.\n\"The Safe Third Country Agreement remains an important tool for Canada and the U.S. to work together on the orderly handling of refugee claims made in our countries,\" Camielle Edwards said in an email.\nEdwards said the government and RCMP were working to address the increase in asylum claims, which remains \"well below previous fluctuations.\"\nFederal government reaffirms commitment to bring Yazidi refugees to Canada As for Rempel and Clement's comments, Taillefer suggested the tougher rules implemented under former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper may have contributed to the current problem by making it more difficult for refugees to enter the country lawfully.\n\"It's a bit their fault if we're in this situation, because the new refugee claim system that is having problems was put in place by the Conservatives in 2012. Before that, we didn't have these kind of problems,\" he said.\n© The Canadian Press, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T00:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T04:10:18.975+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
