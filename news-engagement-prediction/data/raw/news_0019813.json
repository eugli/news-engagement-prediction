Blogger Daphne Caruana Galizia has claimed Dr Cardona and Dr Gerada spent time at the FKK Acapulco club just outside Dusseldorf on the evening of January 30. The FKK Acapulco advertises itself as a \"sauna club\", with services including stripteases, go-go girls and \"30 fully air-conditioned top suites\". \nWatch the full Times Talk interview in the above video. « Chris Cardona discusses brothel allegations on Times Talk Advert <a href='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/ck.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=69945451058&n=423aad7f' target='_blank'> <img src='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/avw.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=69945451058&n=423aad7f' border='0' alt=''/> </a> \nSee our Comments Policy Comments are submitted under the express understanding and condition that the editor may, and is authorised to, disclose any/all of the above personal information to any person or entity requesting the information for the purposes of legal action on grounds that such person or entity is aggrieved by any comment so submitted.
