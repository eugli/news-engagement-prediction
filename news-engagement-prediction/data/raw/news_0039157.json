No. 1 is the Interstate 110 bridge over Los Angeles County's Dominguez Channel, which vehicles cross 274,000 times a day.\nState estimates put the cost of repairing underperforming U.S. bridges at more than $700 billion, Black said in a telephone interview.\n\"I'd say that's conservative,\" she added.\nA bridge is classified structurally deficient if one or more of the key bridge elements, such as the deck, superstructure or substructure, is in \"poor\" or worse condition.\nThe Brooklyn Bridge, a New York suspension bridge built in 1883, is among the state's most-traveled underperforming spans. The landmark structure crossing New York's East River is listed as an urban freeway or expressway with 134,000 daily crossings.\nAmong states, Iowa had the most structurally deficient bridges, at 4,968. Nevada had the fewest, at 31.\nAt least 15 percent of bridges in eight states fell in the underperforming category, with Rhode Island heading the list with a quarter structurally deficient.\n\n(Reporting by Ian Simpson; Editing by Andrew Hay)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T02:22:51.414+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
