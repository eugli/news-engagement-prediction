Independent thought is outlawed and individuality is condemned. While working in the Records Department in the Ministry of Truth, rewriting history, in a way of rebelling, Winston decides to keep a diary, an act punishable by death. \nHoping to send a message and unite audiences, the movie will be screened on April 4, the day Winston begins writing his diary, with 90 participating theatres throughout the U.S. and one in Canada. \nA joint statement on behalf of the participating theatres reads, “Orwell’s novel begins with the sentence, ‘It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.’ Less than one month into the new presidential administration, theatre owners collectively believe the clock is already striking thirteen. Orwell’s portrait of a government that manufactures their own facts, demands total obedience, and demonizes foreign enemies, has never been timelier.” \nIt continues, “The endeavour encourages theatres to take a stand for our most basic values: freedom of speech, respect for our fellow human beings, and the simple truth that there are no such things as ‘alternative facts.’ By doing what they do best – showing a movie – the goal is that cinemas can initiate a much-needed community conversation at a time when the existence of facts, and basic human rights are under attack. Through nationwide participation and strength in numbers, these screenings are intended to galvanize people at the crossroads of cinema and community, and bring us together to foster communication and resistance against current efforts to undermine the most basic tenets of our society.” Related ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:06:39.971+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
