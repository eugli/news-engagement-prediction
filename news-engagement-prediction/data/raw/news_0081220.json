(ABC News: William Rollo) \nCarbon capture and storage (CCS) involves the trapping of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and storing them in such a way as they do not affect the atmosphere. \nAlthough technically possible, such technology has proved to be too expensive for commercial use, and has failed to reach the 50 per cent carbon dioxide emission reduction required under current clean energy guidelines. \nClean Energy Finance Corporation chief executive Oliver Yeats told a Senate estimates hearing on Monday that no CCS project was viable without extensive guarantees from the Government or an insurance company. \nThe Waratah Coal carbon capture and storage project was first proposed in 2009, but Mr Harris said work was suspended because the Queensland Government's timetable was too onerous. \nMr Harris said it was too early to talk about how such a CCS plant would be financed. \n\"We put in the expression of interest to see if we could take this forward once the guidelines had been changed,\" he said. \nWaratah Coal is owned by Clive Palmer's private company Mineralogy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T14:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T10:57:53.227+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
