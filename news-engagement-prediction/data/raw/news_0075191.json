They are very small shops in towns that had independents and very much wish they still had independents but don’t. \n“We can’t open up great big Waterstones here but we can open up small ones. We are coming into quite sensitive high streets with predominantly independent retailers on them and we wish to behave as they do.” \nMany shopkeepers in the towns blame the arrival of national chains for pushing up rents and therefore affecting business rates, which are due to rise sharply in many places over the next few years. \nJohn Wells, 77, who has owned book, card and gift shop Wells of Southwold for 30 years, told the Mail on Sunday: “To call themselves Southwold Books is a bit naughty. Locals know what the shop is, but visitors don’t.” \nThe Waterstones store in Southwold is located in a grade II listed building, and has a sign written in plain lettering on a light blue background above the front door and on a traditional swinging sign. However, a small handwritten sign in the window states: “Southwold Books is the trading name of Waterstones Booksellers Ltd.” \nThe row echoes the disapproving reception that greeted Tesco’s 2013 decision to open a chain of coffee shops under the brand Harris + Hoole, which many customers said that they presumed to be independent. \nChris Viner, 77, who works in a Rye studio that sells model soldiers, told the Mail: “I suspect Waterstones wouldn’t have been able to set up shop if they had stuck a big sign on the front. The whole town would have been up in arms. They would have had their pitchforks out.” \nBut Daunt, whose background is in independent bookshops , says he wants all Waterstones stores to act as independents. And he said he expected more small unbranded Waterstones stores to open up in the years ahead. \n“If you want to enhance a high street you need to act as an independent ... and part of the reason we did it is to convince our own booksellers that they have the autonomy that they do have.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T16:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T11:54:29.218+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
