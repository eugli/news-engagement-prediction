The insight offered into what was really behind the meltdown was interesting and dead on. Having worked on Wall Street, and in fact worked for one of the firms vilified in this documentary, a lot of the subject matter was very accurate. The writer did an excellent job reducing some very complex issues into subject matter that most can understand. However, there was A LOT he left out. This documentary is so left leaning that it undermines what could have been a much more significant piece on what really happened. Two specific examples. First the film went into surface level detail in Goldman Sachs being compensated at 100% for what they were owed for credit default swaps with AIG when AIG was bailed out when others were forced to take less in negotiated bankruptcy cases. What they left out was that Goldman wasn't \"compensated\" for anything. These were collateral pledges that AIG had to meet due to their credit rating dropping. Had that collateral not been posted as in the contract, Goldman would have had much bigger claims against AIG which could have resulted in AIG's default and if you think what happened was bad, this would have been much much worse. While touting that Goldman was repaid 100%, they left out the fact that the union pensions were made whole on GM debt in the GM bailout at the expense of the tax payers. No other GM creditor was granted a 100% bailout. Secondly the documentary leads the viewer to believe that the Bush economic policy deserves the primary blame for easy credit for everyone to buy a house regardless of their financial ability to pay for it. While the Bush economic policy was terrible, it was not the Bush administration that set the country on this course. It started with Clinton and Barney Frank in their unwavering mission of using FNMA and FHLMC as the conduit to put every American in their own home whether they were financially positioned to do so. Nothing was covered on that front. On the margin a well done documentary but could have been a blockbuster had the writer presented the facts in a more balanced and factual way. But as we all know, fact and balance don't sell. Worth a watch but go in understanding the extreme bias of the writer and producer. A must see by Gangstabeck If you ever wondered what really happened in the most recent economic meltdown, not just in the US, but all over the world, this is the movie for you.It gives a full and unflinching look at what is undoubtedly the crime of the century. And how those responsible got to keep all of their pilfered goods. Revolving Door Includes \"Top\" Business Schools by JSF99 From Wall Street to Washington to the University and back again, an important point made in the film is the serious conflicts of interest that exist between university economists (including business school deans) and their subjects of study, such as the derivatives markets. We cannot expect to train future generations of business school graduates in ethical business practices when the professors themselves are corrupt.
