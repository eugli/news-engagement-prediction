(Lisa Schencker/Chicago Tribune) \nJacob Lenzini, the son of an organ donor, and Dr. Martin Hertl, a Rush organ transplant leader, discuss the importance of organ donation. (Lisa Schencker/Chicago Tribune) Lisa Schencker plans to double the number of kidney transplants it performs over the next three years with kidneys from living donors. It also plans to use at least 40 kidneys a year from patients who are brain-dead or whose hearts have stopped functioning. Hospitals typically prefer to use kidneys from living, healthy patients because they can have better outcomes and it can be less costly for hospitals, Hertl said. But using kidneys from deceased donors is an important option for patients who have no immediate living donor options, Hertl said.\n•University of Chicago Medicine plans to increase its transplant activities by 20 percent over the next five years. It's aiming to help more patients on Chicago's South Side, in southern Illinois and northern Indiana get transplants. \n•Loyola University Medical Center plans to launch a pancreas transplant program this year. \n•Northwestern Medicine plans to expand its programs allowing healthy people to donate kidneys and livers and continue its research into building new organs for those in need. \n\"Imagine a world where patients in need of organs can have a customized organ built just in time,\" said Dr. Michael Abecassis, director of Northwestern's Comprehensive Transplant Center. \"We do it with cars. We should be able to do it with organs.\" \nAbecassis said such a world might not be as far off as it once seemed. \nUntil that time, however, transplantation advocates plan to continue working to raise awareness, increase chances for patients to get organs and boost opportunities for potential donors to contribute. \nIllinois lawmaker Rep. Deb Conroy, D-Villa Park, recently introduced a bill that would allow 16- and 17-year-olds to register to be organ and tissue donors when applying for driver's licenses or state IDs, though parents would still have the final say until they turn 18. \nConroy's husband is in kidney failure and has been on dialysis for two years. Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White said he's talked with lawmakers and expects the bill, which will be in committee Thursday, to \"zip through the House without any problems.\" \nMayor Rahm Emanuel said Chicago can be \"a national example of how to help others and give of oneself so others can live fully.\" He spoke with police Superintendent Eddie Johnson at his side. Johnson revealed last month that he is on a waiting list for a kidney transplant. \n\"This is what we want to be known for,\" Johnson said of Chicago and organ transplantation. \nHe wasn't the only member of the law enforcement community to speak Tuesday. \nChristine Ho, the widow of Chicago police Officer Jonathan Ho, also implored more Chicagoans to register to be organ donors. Jonathan Ho died in 2015 after a car struck his motorcycle while he was off-duty. He was an organ donor. \nChristine Ho said her husband was someone who always strove to help others — and who loved spending time with his kids. She and Jonathan, she said, used to talk about what types of grandparents they'd be when they got older. \n\"What will I tell his grandchildren he'll never meet?\" she asked. \"He was a man who helped.\" \nTwitter @lschencker", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:47:00.357+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
