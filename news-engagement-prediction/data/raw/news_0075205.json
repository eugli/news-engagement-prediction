And he’s putting those hopes in no qualified terms.\n“I’m hoping he breaks the bank,” Gronkowski told the Texas-based Star-Telegram .\nThe Patriots tight end was in Florida on Sunday for the Daytona 500. And while he didn’t say if he wanted Bennett to re-sign with the Patriots, Gronkowski did say he thought it would be “good for the industry” and “the position” for his fellow tight end to get a robust, new contract.\nBennett is currently weighing his options in free agency, amid reports that the Patriots are unwilling to pay him more than the $9 million annual sum that Gronkowski makes. Bennett, who made just over $5 million last season, recently dismissed suggestions he should take a pay cut after his standout fill-in season for the Patriots.\nAccording to NFL.com’s Ian Rapoport , Bennett’s departure from the Super Bowl-winning Patriots this offseason — following a year in which he led the oft-sidelined Gronkowski in receptions, yards, and touchdowns — is “a real possibility.”\n“I want to see him do whatever he’s got to do, but I don’t make the calls,” Gronkowski told the Star-Telegram before Sunday’s race, adding that he has “absolutely nothing to do with the front office” decisions regarding Bennett’s free agency.", "external_links": ["http://www.star-telegram.com/sports/nfl/nfl-insider/article135104349.html", "http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000787107/article/martellus-bennett-will-test-freeagent-market"], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T03:22:26.476+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
