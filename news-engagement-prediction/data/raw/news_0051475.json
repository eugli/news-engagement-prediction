A mere 710 bottles of the 100-proof whiskey will be available, with a suggested retail price of $1800. The new release was culled from 11 barrels first distilled in 1989 at the original Stitzel-Weller Distillery, moved to Buffalo Trace in 2002 and transferred to stainless steel tanks in 2014 to prevent over-aging. In other words, Pappy 25 is original stock from the old distillery — a must-have among collectors. The elixir is bottled in handmade glass decanters from the iconic Glencairn Crystal Studio and packaged in handcrafted wooden boxes made from the staves of the oak barrels used to age the very whiskey it houses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:34:04.684+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
