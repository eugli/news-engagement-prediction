In other circumstances, it would be flattering,” he said. \nWhen Lewis, previously considered a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn , stepped down as shadow business secretary after defying Labour’s three-line whip on the article 50 legislation this month, there was speculation in Westminster that he could be preparing for a future leadership bid. \nMore than 50 Labour MPs, including three shadow cabinet ministers, refused to vote for the article 50 bill, but Corbyn and the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, believed the party must not be seen to “block Brexit”, or to appear not to respect the referendum result. \nLewis denied he was plotting against Corbyn, saying, “Jeremy is the elected leader; we have got a leader. I’m not entering into the game of speculation.” \nThe Sunday Times story , published earlier this month, cited military sources as saying Lewis had led a combat camera team filming promotional videos, adding: “The role was unlikely to involve taking part in firefights, the sources said.” \nLewis said he had diaries and documentation detailing combat operations he was involved in in Helmand province in Afghanistan in 2009. He has previously spoken about the depression he suffered after returning to the UK. \nCorbyn last week batted away questions about his leadership, after an embarrassing byelection defeat in Copeland, in which the Conservatives took a seat held by Labour since 1935. It is rare for sitting governments to win byelection seats from the opposition. \nLabour MPs are expected to raise questions about the party’s election strategy at Monday evening’s weekly meeting of the parliamentary Labour party, which Corbyn is not expected to attend. \nSeparately, a spokesman for John McDonnell sought to withdraw comments the shadow chancellor made in an article suggesting a “soft coup” against Corbyn was already under way. \nIn the piece on the Labour Briefing website, dated 26 February, McDonnell said: “The tactics include daily and constant behind-the-scenes non-attributable briefings against Jeremy and his shadow cabinet every time he or his shadow ministers make a statement, intervene in parliament or launch a policy. The plotters use every opportunity to chip away at Jeremy’s standing to seek to demean him and undermine support for him in the Labour party and among Labour supporters.” \nA spokesperson for McDonnell said on Monday: “This article was written over a week ago in response to the intervention from Tony Blair. As John said yesterday he wants us all to focus on party unity following last week’s byelection results.” \nAny challenger to Corbyn would have to gather the signatures of 15% of the party’s MPs and MEPs – a threshold some in the party hope to reduce to 5%, in a measure due to be discussed at Labour’s autumn conference. \nMPs on the left wing of the party, such as the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey – known to be the favoured choice of some in Corbyn’s team – are thought to be unlikely to gather enough nominations.
