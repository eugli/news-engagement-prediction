It’s maybe a bit too posh and old-fashioned for us but there’s a lot of room. \n“They have even rolled out the red carpet,” he says pointing at the grand spiral staircase. Squatters Daniel Gardonyi, 36, and Daniel stand in front of a boarded up window \nThe group came under physical attack from a group they described as \"fascists\" on Saturday. \n“We called the embassies to warn them that people were coming down to cause trouble and it wasn’t us. \n\"It wasn’t too scary my comrade turned the fire extinguisher on them. \n“If we are out there we are visible, we can buy tents and start another protest action just outside. \n“The eviction will be non-violent but they are going to have to smash through a Grade II listed building to get to us and they always make a bigger mess.” Squatter Dwain Kaye inside the group's 'media room' inside the squat \nThe Anarchist collective spent the night on patrols along the balcony, barricading windows and putting up a large canvas on the roof in a bid to prevent police entry. \nAnother squatter called Daniel said he had seen police training to break into the home to intimidate them. \nHe said: “I was having a cigarette on our lovely balcony and I just saw a crew of what looked like rock climbers with ropes hurrying down the road. \n“I thought to myself ‘we’re in Eaton Square I don’t think there are any rock climbing places here’ but I could see for miles. We spotted them so they ran off. \n“We’ll still be here even after the judge kicked off. It was worth going to court sometimes a miracle happens, you never know. But we are poor people against a very wealthy businessman so we didn’t have much chance. \n“Squats in Manchester never get this much attention which is why we’ve done it in such a high profile area.” \nLast year Eaton Square was named the most expensive place to buy property in Britain, with homes costing on average £17 million. Belgravia squatters 'attacked by mob of fascists' \nThe house is one of four purchased by Goncharenko over a three-year period, including Hanover Lodge, in Regent’s Park, for which he paid £120m – making it one of the UK’s most expensive homes. \nA marketing manager, 28, who lives opposite the occupied mansion, told the Standard: \"There are rules and regulations. Everything has to be kept in keeping with the neighbourhood; it might be a bit Stepford Wives but lots of people like it.” \nAnother neighbour on the exclusive street, added: “They haven’t been trouble at all. No noise or late night raves but it definitely looks messy [Duke of Westminster] Grosvenor would be turning in his grave if he saw the house like that. \n“Whenever I walk around Victoria around McDonalds I do see the homeless problem has got worse, I do appreciate that. There shouldn’t be a hole that people fall into. But if someone squatted my home I would be furious.” \nDwain Kaye, who represented the group in court and was landed with a bill of £8,735 in costs, added: “This is about human rights, this is about our world and what we can do to change our perception of the world. \n“What happens to the people here if they are forced to leave and the state isn’t there to make the basic provisions to survive?” More about: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T16:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T11:42:00.155+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
