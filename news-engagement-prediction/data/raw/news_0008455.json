Then a lot of people who were more serious and were voicing how they were disgusted at Trump and how they thought May has just rolled over and been submissive to him.” \nThe artist said he encountered one Trump supporter who was less than impressed with the work, adding: “He was an American tourist and he just stood there and took it in for a while. They he looked at me and said: ‘You are disgusting’ and walked away. That was awkward.” \nPegasus said he created the work as he “felt passionately” about the relationship between May and Trump. “A lot of the time, when I watch the news, I feel like I am watching an apocalyptic movie. Protests round the world, it is a crazy world we live in now. I wanted to express my concern through the work.” More about: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T16:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T11:27:58.961+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
