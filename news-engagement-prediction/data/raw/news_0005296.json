Hogg VII) is actually female. Photo Staten Island Chuck resides in this adorable log cabin from spring through autumn, when the weather is warmer. Credit Amy Lombard for The New York Times “Staten Island Chuck will always be Staten Island Chuck,” said Rebecca Orens , assistant manager of the children’s center at the zoo. “But through the years, things change.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The 4-year-old, 8.5-pound animal, which Ms. Orens described as “a curvy lady right now,” feeds on nutritious rodent pellets, roughage like kale, and sweet potatoes. Perhaps they serve something similar at your local lunch spot. And the groundhog is quite the social butterfly. In preparation for today, Ms. Chuck has spent months training and socializing with zoo caretakers to ensure an elegant public appearance (free of any spats with the mayor , who is skipping the event this year) and a confident, correct, shadow-or-no-shadow verdict. Photo Ms. Chuck and her caretaker, Rebecca Orens. Credit Amy Lombard for The New York Times While Ms. Chuck won’t do much public speaking this morning, “she does know how to high-five,” Ms. Orens said. “Which is really cute, but is also really good as a medical move because you can then clip her nails.” (She does not, however, take baths or get her teeth cleaned.)

Here’s what else is happening: Weather Shadow or not, city marmots will see relatively cheerful skies outside their burrows. The sun will soon be creeping out from behind the clouds and should tug the mercury up to a high of 43 . (Although wind gusts this afternoon could make it feel colder.) Not bad for the dead of winter. In the News • The City Council approved a number of bills to help tenants of “three-quarter houses” find permanent homes.
