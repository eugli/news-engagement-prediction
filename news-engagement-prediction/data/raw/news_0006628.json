Historic Sask. grain elevator destroyed by fire \n“I ran out there. A lot of the volunteer firefighters were there already. They got there really quick because a lot of them were getting up to haul grain.” \nThe fire was close to parked tanker railcars, so the firefighters and some other volunteers went door-to-door in the town of more than 100 people and told residents to leave until the railcars were removed a few hours later. \nGizen said there was nothing that could be done to save the building, but the firefighters did monitor the embers which were landing about 300 to 400 metres away throughout the town. \n“We just kind of watched it,” Gizen said. \n“There was not much we could do.” What the fire looks like now pic.twitter.com/xw08gV41q7 \n— Jason Gizen Jagfarms (@gizen_jason) January 31, 2017 \nAccording to Gizen, no other buildings were damaged, including his seed processing plant, located about 150 metres from the grain elevator. \n“The wind was blowing the fire away from the town and the other businesses,” Gizen said. \n“It was a lucky thing. The wind was in our favour. The wind was out of the northwest and the town is northeast of the grain elevator. It was kind of blowing in the direction where there was nothing but open fields and grass and the tanker cars. \nThe view of the grain elevator fire in Prelate, Sask. as seen from volunteer firefighter Jason Gizen’s yard.

Gizen said there was a small grass fire around it, but the snow and moisture is helping to contain the blaze. \nThe grain elevator was still in use for organic grain storage. \n“I was kind of shocked and kind of sad,” Gizen said. \n“It’s the last elevator in our town and there’s not many left in Saskatchewan. A lot of good memories, growing up and hauling grain into the elevator. A lot of people here are pretty shaken up and sad. A couple of jobs lost now in our town.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T20:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:01:40.344+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
