The couple were also joined by close friend John Legend and his baby girl Luna Leave a comment \nBeyoncé looked picture perfect as she kicked back with her husband Jay Z and their daughter Blue Ivy at the 2017 NBA All-Star Game in New Orleans on Sunday. The 35-year-old, who is pregnant with twins, appeared to be in great and relaxed spirits as she watched the game with her loved ones. Keeping a watchful eye over her five-year-old daughter, the singer oozed style and glamour in a pair of ripped denim jeans and a plain white T-shirt, which was worn with a tropical patterned kimono. \nJay Z and Blue Ivy's reaction to Beyonce's Grammys performance is everything: watch \nJay Z, 47, kept his cool in a deep red sweater over a white V-neck tee and black jeans, while Blue Ivy looked every inch the mini fashionista in a denim jacket over a lime green dress, which was styled further with black low-top Converse All-Star sneakers. Her parents lovingly doted on her, giving her candy floss and making sure she was the centre of their attention. The adorable family were also joined by close friend John Legend , who took to the Smoothie King Centre stage to perform a medley of his songs during the official half-time show. The singer brought his cute baby daughter Luna along with him – he took to his Instagram page to share a sweet picture of the pair of them, in the caption he gushed: \"Basketball with baby Luna.\" A post shared by John Legend (@johnlegend) on Feb 19, 2017 at 5:38pm PST \n5 reasons why we're so excited about Beyoncé's baby news \nBeyoncé's appearance comes shortly after she dazzled crowds at this year's Grammy Awards show. Showing off her blossoming baby bump in all it's glory, the star hit the stage to deliver a highly energetic performance of her songs Love Drought and Sandcastle. Earlier this month, Beyoncé announced on Instagram that she is expecting twins . \"We would like to share our love and happiness,\" she captioned a photo of herself holding her baby bump in front of a wall of flowers. \"We have been blessed two times over. We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two, and we thank you for your well wishes. - The Carters.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T13:16:03.135+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
