The Mavericks were able to move center Andrew Bogut, who was a part of the rather puzzling trade that sent Nerlens Noel from Philadelphia to Dallas. \nWhile Bogut is currently on the 76ers roster, he is expected to be bought out in the coming days. According to Yahoo! Sports’ Shams Charania, Bogut has spoken to Philadelphia head coach Brett Brown and expressed his desire to play for a championship contender. \n“Bogut has had a phone conversation with 76ers coach Brett Brown since his trade from Dallas, league sources said, and he respects Brown and the culture of the 76ers,” Charania writes. “However, Bogut wants to pursue a championship and play a significant role for a veteran team. Cleveland, San Antonio, Houston, Boston and Utah have had discussions with Bogut’s representatives over the last 24 hours, league sources said.” \nOut of those five teams mentioned, Bogut’s services would probably be of most use to the Boston Celtics. Boston is in dire need of an interior presence, as it is currently near the bottom of the league in nearly every rebounding category. \nWhile Bogut seems like a natural fit for Boston, C’s fans should not get ahead of themselves. Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge has already expressed his reluctance to bring in new players mid-season, saying it sometimes “messes with team chemistry.” \nThumbnail photo via Jerome Miron/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T16:03:24.747+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
