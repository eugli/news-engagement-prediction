Did you notice? \nWhat about his strong second half, where he had a 2.67 ERA? \nManaea might not have ace stuff — he's no Jon Gray — but if he continues to do what he did in 2016 in 2017, the former first-round pick will establish himself as a more-than-reliable starter this season. \nI wonder what the A's will be able to get for him in a trade this June... Tim Heitman Tim Heitman-USA TODAY Sports 12 Alex Bregman - 3B - Astros \nThe Astros, needing a third baseman in the worst way last year, opted not to move for one of the several proven commodities on the trade market — they called up Bregman, the No. 2 overall pick in the 2015 Draft. \nGood call. \nBregman, in 217 plate appearances, posted a slash line of .264/.313/.478, hinting to his potential at age 21. \nWhat's he going to do at age 22 as the Astros now-everyday third baseman? \nA slash line of .265/.330/.445 is the consensus from the projection services — that's along with 20 homers and 80 RBI. \nBut if Bregman hits like he did in August, 25 homers and 100 RBIs are hardly out of the question. \nYeah, the Astros were smart to wait. Tommy Gilligan Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports 11 \nRay was the unluckiest pitcher in recent Major League history last year. \nSeriously. \nRay was one of the best pitchers in baseball last year — stay with me here — if you look at his SIERA, xFIP, K-BB rate, and Deserved Run Average (which we'll be using a lot of this season). \nBut he also had a .352 batting average on balls in play against last year, the second-highest rate in the last 15 years. \nRay isn't blameless in that — he is the one throwing the balls that are being hit — but bad defense and bad luck are the main culprits. \nIt's highly unlikely that Ray will come anywhere close to being that unlucky again (particularly if he stops throwing his sinker), which leaves you with a pitcher who at age 24 had the 21st best K/9 rate (11.25) among all starting pitchers in baseball history. Joe Camporeale Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports 10 Gregory Polanco - OF - Pirates \nWelcome to the tier of established young hot shots who will become household names in 2017. \nLet's start with Polanco, the ridiculously talented Pirates outfielder, whose breakout 2016 season was derailed by injuries. \nBefore knee and shoulder problems limited him, Polanco had a first half where he hit .287 with 12 homers, 50 RBI and nine stolen bases. \nPolanco played most of the 2016 season, but he only finished with 22 homers and he hit .220 in the second half. \nBut fully healthy, Polanco, who has always projected as a 25-25 player is ready to hit that mark and make his first All-Star Game. Charles LeClaire Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY Sports 9 Jon Gray - SP - Rockies \nYou should already know Jon Gray, but this should be the year he jumps to star status. \nSimply put, Gray just needs to keep doing what he did in 2016 and his numbers should be strong enough to move him up a class. \nHe had a 3.18 FIP in the second half of last season, which, when paired with his strikeout per inning average which, should his ERA stay close to that number (and even at Coors Field, there's no reason to think it shouldn't) would put him in Cy Young contention in the National League. Matt Kartozian Matt Kartozian-USA TODAY Sports 8 Joc Pederson - OF - Dodgers \nPederson has been a three true outcomes All-Star for two seasons now, but this year, he's going to become a real All-Star. \nPederson has always put up strong baseball card stats — he's hit 25 homers in each of his first two seasons — but last year he showed that he's ready to make the leap into sabermetric success as well. \nYou only have to look at Pederson's contact rates year-over-year to see that he's poised to make the jump. \nLast year, his contact percentage jumped 8.3 percent year-over-year — a huge leap — and his contact percentage on pitches in the strike zone went up 7.2 points. \nPederson is becoming a more complete hitter and I'd expect his strikeout rate to decrease in 2017. The tradeoff will be more walks — he's fouling off more pitches now and he's always had a good eye — and a higher average. \nDepending on how the Dodgers use him, a .265 average, .380 OBP, and 30 homers are well within sight. \nGary A. Vasquez Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports 7 Julio Urias - SP - Dodgers \nThe Dodgers are going to have to unleash the now-20-year-old Urias at some point. \nIt might not be this year, but that might not stop him from having a true breakout season anyway. \nUrias is a bonafide prodigy -- in his last 13 starts of the 2016 regular season (while on strict pitch limits) Urias was statistically one of the best pitchers in baseball, posting a 1.26 WHIP and 2.35 FIP while striking out 10.2 per nine and posting a 18.6 K-BB percentage. \nHe was 19 years old. \nThat's not fair. \nWalks are an issue for the young Mexican, but again, he was 19 years old going up against Major League hitters in a pennant race — of course walks were an issue (he averaged 3.2 walks per nine innings in those last 13 starts, just above league average). \nThe Dodgers are likely to start Urias' season late to help ease his workload — that young arm needs to be protected — and they might put him on another pitch limit when he finally is summoned back to the show. \nSavor the moments, Major League hitters — this might be the only relief you get for a long time. \nJake Roth Jake Roth-USA TODAY Sports 6 James Paxton - SP - Mariners \nJames Paxton always had good stuff, but after starting the 2016 season in Triple-A, he came back even more electric — his fastball was two miles per hour faster, touching 100 miles per hour from the left side. \nWas a new pitcher — there was a change in his mechanics (he's dropping his arm slot) and he was using wicked cutter that might be the best in the game. \nAnd then Paxton brought back his plus curve ball late in the season. \nArmed with an impressive arsenal, Paxton had a big second half, posting a 2.69 FIP and coming in 7th in the majors in FIP, and he was the best pitcher in the American League in September and October — he finished the season with five starts where his strikeouts per nine innings was above 10 and his FIP was a paltry 2.06 (xFIP of 2.66). \nPaxton called his 2016 season a work in progress — and that stands to reason — but it clearly worked. \nWhat's a full season going to look like? Bet on really, really good. Jennifer Buchanan Jennifer Buchanan-USA TODAY Sports 5 Kyle Schwarber - OF - Cubs \nIt's hard to believe, but Kyle Schwarber, hero of the 2016 World Series, has only played 71 regular-season games in the Major Leagues. \nHe's poised to get a full season this year, and you should expect him to make the absolute most of it. \nSchwarber is a truly impressive power hitter — he showed that in the 2015 postseason when he hit five homers is 31 at bats. And this year, with his knee fully healed, the momentum of success behind him, and the burden of catching poised to be a rarity, that power should be on full display. \nIn 273 plate appearances in 2015, he posted a 132 wRC+, despite a high strikeout rate of 28 percent. That's led every projection system to predict close to 30 bombs this year, but don't count out 40 for Schwarber in the Cubs' lineup, which offers all sorts of protection. \nThis is a guy who can hit anything — even if that strikeout rate stays high, he's likely to exceed our expectations. That's kind of his thing now. Ken Blaze Ken Blaze-USA TODAY Sports 4 Addison Russell - SS - Cubs \nYou know Addison Russell — he's the Cubs' young shortstop who tied the World Series record for most RBI in a game last fall. \nHell, he was an All-Star last year. \nBut this year, Russell is poised to really break out this regular season and become a household name that's uttered often. He's going to actually earn that All-Star bid. \nRussell has been a negative WAR offensive player for the last two seasons, despite hitting 21 homers and 95 runs last year. This is the year that changes. \nRussell is unlikely to be a high average player — he's a .240 hitter in two seasons — but his progression at the plate throughout his professional career signals that he's ready to take another step forward. \nThe biggest key: diminishing pop-ups. Last year, 15 percent of Russell's balls in play resulted in popups. \nThat, and bad luck, resulted in a .277 batting average on balls in play last year. \nThe BABIP should take care of itself — Russell should have been at the league average last year (.300), based on his contact rates — and if he can diminish the pop-up rates by even five percent, the Cubs are looking at a 23-year-old shortstop with a plus glove who can hit 25 homers, drive in 100 runs and hit .265 with a OPS near .850. \nThis year, Russell should earn that All-Star bid. \nTommy Gilligan Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports 3 Carlos Rodon - SP - White Sox \nIt all comes down to control for Rodon, who has dominating stuff — when he can find the zone. In the second half of the 2016 season, he showed clear signs that he's ready to be one of the best pitchers in baseball in 2017. \nRodon already boasted one of the best K-BB rates in baseball, striking out batters 15.9 percent more often than walking them, 25th in the big leagues last year — but between Aug. 6 and Sept. 9 last year, he posted a 1.08 WHIP and 2.67 FIP. \nThose are elite numbers. \nThe change that sparked the great run was relying more on his changeup — during that stretch he threw two or three times more changeups compared to his career averages. \nRodon has a plus fastball and an elite slider, but by trading in some sliders, which he has difficulty controlling, for some changeups, Rodon has shown a three-pitch arsenal that has him poised for a career year — one that can put him in a class among the best pitchers in baseball. Mike Dinovo Mike DiNovo-USA TODAY Sports 2 Marcus Stroman - SP - Blue Jays \nDuring the dog days of the 2016 season (June, July, August), Stroman might have been the best pitcher in the American League, striking out 85 in 86 innings of work, walking only 15, and posting a 2.73 xFIP. \nHe wasn't able to start the season that way, or end it (though he did start the Wild Card Game and turn in a solid outing in a game the Blue Jays would win), so his breakout hasn't happened. \nBut it is nigh. \nThat's because this season, Stroman sustains that great form. \nThere are few pitchers in baseball that can boast Stroman's strikeout ability, or control, or ability to get hitters to put the ball on the ground (60 percent of batted balls against him were grounders last year — which was down from his 2015 mark). Combine the three and you have a pitcher that can only be described as \"lights out\". \nIf Stroman does indeed put up a full season like his strong three-month stretch, he'll win the 2017 American League Cy Young award. \nNoah K. Murray Noah K. Murray-USA TODAY Sports 1 Trea Turner - SS - Nationals \nTurner broke out last year, but this season, he's poised to become a bonafide superstar. \nIf you can get in a wager on Turner to win National League MVP, do so ASAP. \nLast season, in half a season, Turner hit .342 with a .937 OPS and 33 stolen bases. \nYes, it's likely he'll regress in his first full Major League season, but what if he doesn't? \nThose are MVP numbers, without a question. That doesn't even factor in Turner's defensive ability at shortstop, where he'll play this season. \nYes, Turner is poised to enter the class of baseball's elite in 2017. Gary A. Vasquez Gary A.
