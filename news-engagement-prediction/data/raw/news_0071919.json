Show All Items \n**If you like this project, please consider giving it a vote** \nCanadians produces 725 tonnes of e-waste annually. After seeing all of the electronics thrown away at my school, I am not surprised by this statistic. I believe that most thrown away electronics have a lot of hidden use. I wanted to prove this by building a machine entirely out of garbage. \nAfter looking at the electronics that I hoarded...ahem...I mean collected, I realised I could build a CNC machine. \nThat's right, all of the components used in this project were thrown away. NO ARDUINO WAS USED TO RUN THE MACHINE! NO DRIVERS WERE PURCHASED TO CONTROL THE STEPPERS! All of the metal was salvaged from local scrap bins and all of the electronics came from my school's e-waste program. We did use some new solder, glue, and tape to put the machine together though. \nThe end result is a three axis cnc that can draw shapes on a wipe board. The CNC has 1.5 in of play in all directions. \nI hope that this project demonstrates the enormous advantages of up-cycling and free-cycling. \nKey Points All of the components used in this project were thrown away; except for glue, tape, solder, and some wire. I based the design off of what I found whilst dumpster diving. Your design will vary depending on your luck. Read the whole documentation first to get a general idea. Eventually I want to turn this CNC made out of garbage into a 3D printer made out of garbage. Building a CNC made from new parts would take less time and produce better results. This project was started to prove that thrown away electronics have a lot of potential. The purpose of this project is to show the benefits of up-cycling and free-cycling \nWatch the video for a good cover! Step 1: How It Works Show All Items \nThe hardest part about building a CNC is designing the motorised linear slide system. Conveniently, all of this engineering is already contained within a CD drive. We are going to cannibalise some CD drives and mount them as needed on a piece of scrap wood. The specific part that we are removing from the CD Drive is called the \"sled\". The sled is the component that contains the linear actuator. The part of the sled that moves up and down is called the \"tray\". \nThe type of motor that drives the sled is a stepper motor. Controlling steppers can be tricky. We need a stepper driver to control the stepper motor. We are going to salvage stepper drivers out of old floppy drives. \nI downloaded some CNC software (Mach3) on a thrown away computer. The computer will communicate with the stepper driver though the DB-25 port. The DB-25 port is a really old type of computer port. It has seven output pins that we are going to interface with the stepper drivers. It's easy to find computers with a DB-25 port. They are generally in a trashcan.:) \nThe computer used in this project does not need to be high quality. The computer that I used has 256mb of RAM and runs Windows XP. Using Mach3 (and Lazycam which comes installed with Mach3), we can convert a CAD file into gcode. Gcode is a file type that is used by most CNC software. \nSo basically... \nCNC software (Mach3) on Windows XP computer --> \nMotor controller taken from floppy drive --> \nLinear Actuator taken from CD Drive --> \nA robot that draws stuff :) Thank you very much. <p>Amazingly impressive job! </p> Why did you choose to move the base up and down instead of just the pen? If that were the case, then the third axis would have to move the other two. lm not sure if the axis could move all that weight. <p>Wonderfull idea, I like it alot and is something I've been thinking about to. Substitute the pen for a high power laser and you have a CNC laser cutter. :-P</p> <p>Nailed it!So much potential in there. Thumbs up from me sir! Just one thing..as far as I know, linear actuators that printers use run on dc motors, using a linear or rotary encoder to measure distance traveled. This could be a pain in the ass! (with all the encoders demanded currents and loops). Just a heads up!</p> <p>Thanks for the tip!</p> &quot;Old&quot; printers/scanners should have steppers. Use the heavy weight of the beastie to help determine if it might be using steppers. <p>I can see using either old floppy drives or cd drives. But since it is easier to obtain a CD drive guts, that would have been the logical choice these days. Also much more efficient, and easy to find ways to even using scrap electronics, to design with. Most CD sled motors are likely to use 3 volts or less, and have simply 4 leads so that they step by applying dc voltage for short intervals, alternating the direction by stepping into each winding, and then reversing polarity to go the other way. The challenge of using the onboard PCB is that CD drives PCB are surface mount based, and so would require possibly having to remove the IC that does the stepping and soldering to its possibly small pins without destroying it. Brining up the centronics printer port to logic levels is also a slight challenge but can be done, you do have to send ACK bit to get the data to flow out, is about all. Many projects have been built around it. We built an entire lighting system using a Commodore 64 and a handfull of logic chips resistors and triacs. </p> Nice job. I am going to instruct mine but Why you didn't use CD drive's own boards instead the boards of floppy drives? <p>Whenever i took the sled out of the CD drive, I always ended up damaging the pcb. I couldn't successfully remove both the pcb and sled from the cd drive.</p><p>I would be interested to see if this project can be done with cd drive boards. I'm not sure if a CD drive board can be manipulated in the same way as the floppy drive board though.</p> <p>Thanks for replay. Actually I have about 9 CD and DVD drive PCB's and the same number of sleds. My only problem is arrangement of the pins. Is there any refrences for the pin arrangement?</p> <p>Attached is one example of a CD drive data sheet. I assume that the first 10 pins control the linear slide. Different CD drives might have different data sheets, so I recommend searching for the specific datasheet for your CD drive.</p><p>img source: http://akashkumar4u.blogspot.ca/2013/05/cddvd-motor-driver-hack-to-run-its-own.html</p> <p>They cant from my experience they are standard brushed motors with stop sensors.. </p> <p>But the motor that drives the sled is a stepper. Surely there has to be a stepper driver on the cd's board then.</p> <p>It's not completely run from GARBADGE until it's run from an iPhone.</p> <p>lol so true</p> <p>Great Job! You have brought together all the pieces! It is a wonderful starting point for anyone getting into DIY CNC/laser cutters. </p> <p>CONGRATULATIONS !!! you project just give me the reason about why all the people JUST use an arduino for their projects, instead of use another mean to drive the motors. what if i cant buy an arduino? what if i like (just as you did)is how to recycle all the &quot;trash&quot; that you can find everywhere and pollutes the world . you gave me exactly a way to solve the problem about to control a stepper motor without an arduino (i don't hate them , but i don't want to be an &quot;arduino-dependant &quot; as many people that whitout it are practically lost ), and is awesome the way you did it ! as a improvement, i suggest you look for a way to make reverse ingeniering on a &quot;useless&quot; printer to control it and give a new use. again, CONGRATULATIONS for your proyect </p> <p>Wouaaaaw !</p> <p>Nice!</p> <p>Great project! This is the first time I see that does not use external drivers (or aduino) for the motors.<br>Garbage power!!!</p> <p>That is very good project </p> nice job, but I can,t calibrate mach 3 <p>What's wrong with your Mach3 calibration?</p> <p>Great!!!
