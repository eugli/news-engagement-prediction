PUBLISHED: 16:08, Tue, Feb 21, 2017 | UPDATED: 16:24, Tue, Feb 21, 2017 \nBaroness Falkner told the House of Lords she will vote in favour of the Government’s Article 50 Bill, despite her party’s opposition to the proposed legislation. \nLiberal Democrat peers are plotting to meddle with the Bill in order to add their insistence a final Brexit deal between the EU and Britain must be approved by a national referendum. \nThe party have suggested such a public vote should also include the option to remain in the EU. \nMr Farron saw his attempt to add such a clause to the Article 50 Bill overwhelmingly defeated in the House of Commons - but the Liberal Democrats will be more hopeful of success in the unelected chamber where they have significantly more members. \nBut Baroness Falkner told peers the call for another EU referendum did not have her support as it “entails risks for which the price is too high” for both Britain and other European countries. Related articles Lord Mandelson: I WASN'T a Remainer because of my EU pension \nDismissing the argument from leading Remainers such as Tony Blair that the British public voted for Brexit without full knowledge of the consequences, Baroness Falkner said: “It has been stated the people voted for a departure but not a destination. \n“In my view, people had a very clear idea of the destination. The destination was a break from the EU. \n“I agree they did not know exactly what the terrain would look like but they knew they were taking a risk. \n“A vote is always conducted on imperfect information. There is an inherent risk in any decision about the future, whether it's intervention into Syria or whether it's EU on this occasion.” PA Baroness Falkner rubbished Tim Farron's demand for a second referendum In my view, people had a very clear idea of the destination. The destination was a break from the EU. Baroness Falkner \nBaroness Falkner highlighted the example of EU member states holding national referendums before deciding to join the euro, with voters “in their nightmares” unable to know the disaster that would follow. \nShe also told peers the remaining EU 27 would not accept Britain reversing its decision to quit the bloc depending on the result of another referendum. \nBaroness Falkner said: “While it may be theoretically possible to revoke Brexit while talks are still going on in the next two years… politically we cannot revert to the status quo ante. \n“It is contrary to what the EU, the other 27 countries, envisage in terms of their understanding of Article 50 that, in effect, it is politically irrevocable. \n“Once we've passed this Bill there is no longer any possibility of a negotiation where the UK could go into the talks again with a set of demands on the proviso that if they're not good enough we'll have another referendum.” Remoaner-in-chief: Blair's Views on Brexit Fri, February 17, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:14:55.482+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
