But this time, while the administration has been clear that it is not interested in being a champion for transgender rights, the effect is hardly earth-shattering. \nLet’s take a deep breath and remember that the Supreme Court doesn’t answer to the U.S. Department of Education. The Supreme Court is the final arbiter of questions about interpretation of federal law; Trump or no Trump, those eight (maybe nine?) legal heavyweights aren’t about to start backing off their responsibilities. Now that we’ve recentered a bit, we can take a good look at what happened yesterday between the DOJ, the DOE, and the case of transgender student Gavin Grimm. \nA refresher on Gavin Grimm’s upcoming SCOTUS case: \nGavin Grimm is a 17 year-old transgender boy in rural Virginia who sued his local school district over a policy requiring him to use the girls’ bathroom. The crux of Gavin’s claim was that a rule mandating the use of bathrooms that correspond with “biological gender” violates his civil rights, and the civil rights of other transgender students. Instead of allowing Gavin to use the boys’ bathroom, Gavin’s school principal instituted a rule requiring him to use a single-stall unisex restroom. \nOne of Gavin’s central arguments is that Title IX (the federal law prohibiting gender discrimination) requires schools to permit transgender students to use bathrooms consistent with their gender identity. SCOTUS granted certiorari in Gavin’s case not only to answer a question of great importance to Gavin, but also to address a split in the federal courts. The Fourth Circuit deemed Title IX’s use of the word “sex” ambiguous, while the district court in Texas held that “sex” means only biological sex given at birth. In other words, in the Carolinas, schools are prohibited from forcing a person identifying as a boy to use a girls’ restroom, while Texas schools are allowed to do just that. As is its job, SCOTUS will rule on questions actually raised by litigants in Gavin Grimm’s case – and will not simply opine on what’s “fair” in a general sense. What had been happening with the Grimm case before Trump took office? \nThe Obama administration issued a “Dear Colleague Letter” (“DCL”) to clarify its position on what it believed Title IX required of schools. The letter required schools to treat students consistent with their gender identities as follows: \n“The Departments interpret Title IX to require that when a student or the student’s parent or guardian, as appropriate, notifies the school administration that the student will assert a gender identity that differs from previous representations or records, the school will begin treating the student consistent with the student’s gender identity.” \nEssentially, the Obama administration stood up for Gavin Grimm and other transgender students, and publicly declared that a mandate for students to use facilities inconsistent with their gender identities is discriminatory. So what did the Trump administration do Wednesday? \nIt officially withdrew the guidelines that the Obama administration had put forth in its DCL, and blamed that administration for causing trouble. Our new DOE and DOJ issued a letter to the clerk of the Supreme Court, updating SCOTUS on the government’s position in the Gavin Grimm case, which is scheduled for oral arguments on March 28. That letter, posted by NBC News’ Bradd Jaffy, specifically calls out the Obama administration making a claim, failing to back up that claim, and otherwise causing confusion about how or why Title IX dictates school policies for transgender students. That letter stated: \n“These guidance documents do not… contain extensive legal analysis or explain how the position is consistent with the express language of Title IX, nor did they undergo any formal public process. This interpretation has given rise to significant litigation regarding school restrooms and locker rooms.” \nThe letter goes on to remind SCOTUS about the split among federal courts over what “sex” means, and crescendos to a demand that these matters are left to the discretion of individual states and local school districts. Finally, the letter ends with a reminder that regardless of Title IX’s application to this particular issue, LGBT students are still protected from discrimination, bullying, or harassment based on existing rules. What does this change in policy actually mean? \nIt means something, but it doesn’t mean everything. Of course, the position a presidential administration takes on a controversial issue is meaningful, particularly in its ability to influence the public. When the Obama administration issued its DCL, those fighting for social justice were gratified to see our government standing together with the transgender community to demand tolerance and inclusion in the face of complex and sensitive questions. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:14:20.983+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
