Always. However, not all firing scenarios are created equal, and some clearly suck a lot more than others. Say, for instance; you’re an actor or actress who was fired while on set. That can’t be fun at all. Worse still, if you’re actor or actress who was fired, but only after all your scenes were filmed, and the director kinda, sorta, realized that you weren’t the best fit for the production after all. Nope, definitely not fun. You might be surprised how often it can happen, and even to actors you might just assume are safe no matter what! For example – Ryan Gosling was once fired after gorging himself 60 pounds heavier, and Anne Hathaway was once meant to be part of a “high-larious” comedy but the director realized just in time that it was not right! In fact, we’ve rounded up a list of 21 instances of it happening. Knowing what we know about the fickle nature of Hollywood, it’s probably safe to say that the 21 actors and actresses listed in this slideshow are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to losing a job in less than ideal circumstances.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T09:58:18.082+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
