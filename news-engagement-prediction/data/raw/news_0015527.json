And it didn’t disappoint. In addition to belting out a medley of hit songs including “Born This Way,” “Poker Face,” and “Bad Romance,” she included subtle but powerful political messages of inclusion and activism. But the most jaw-dropping aspect of Gaga’s performance was her amazing stunts, which ranged from bungee jumping to aerial and trapeze tricks that were worthy of a Cirque de Soleil show. Nevertheless, Lady Gaga was body-shamed for her Super Bowl performance by social media users who criticized her “tummy rolls” by telling her to get a bigger-sized outfit. One person even posted a photo of Pillsbury biscuits gushing out of their package with a caption claiming it was a photo of Gaga’s stomach. More First of all, let’s state the obvious — it’s physically impossible to perform superhero-level stunts without your stomach moving. It’s pretty depressing and disheartening that some people chose to focus on this so-called “problem area” instead of, you know, Gaga’s amazing performance. Luckily, her fans came to her defense and schooled the haters. Lady Gaga and I have the same stomach and I've never felt more inspired/confident #gaga Shoutout to lady gaga's stomach roll for showing girls that you don't need to have a perfect body to absolutely kill it ✨ — Erin Moore (@erin_m24) February 6, 2017 These are just a few examples of people who were quick to point out that body-shaming is ridiculously problematic and damaging. A number of fans described Gaga’s body as “normal,” “perfect,” or “real.” Although the sentiment absolutely comes from the right place, it’s important to remember that all bodies fit this description. Body-shaming a person like Gaga (who is, by most people’s standards, in great shape) is no worse than criticizing a plus-size man or woman because weight is not an accurate indicator of overall health and all bodies are beautiful. It’s similar to the statement “real women have curves.” Plenty of women do, and their curves are beautiful and should be celebrated — but some women are naturally “ruler-shaped.” Their bodies are also very real, normal, and gorgeous.This isn’t the first time social media trolls have taken aim at Lady Gaga’s body — in September 2014, she posted an Instagram photo of herself clad in a bathing suit for a midnight swim and received a barrage of comments from people who criticized her “weight gain.” She responded on Twitter in the perfect manner — by pointing out that shallowness is the truly ugly quality, and we should focus on actual problems, like the people starving in the world, rather than a celebrity who may or may not have gained a few pounds. @AlbiCalderone Id rather be fat than be shallow \n— xoxo, Joanne (@ladygaga) September 8, 2014 @_gypsylife_ all day long every day, so what if I got a belly sometimes, sometimes I don’t. There’s people starving in the world. #whocares", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T07:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T05:58:54.562+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
