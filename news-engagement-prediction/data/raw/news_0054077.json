Heavy police bandobast in Mumbai today! pic.twitter.com/sY0H3xzXl3 â€” Shobhaa De (@DeShobhaa) February 21, 2017 \nBut the Mumbai police didn't take her crass pun lying down. Their official Twitter handle took on De and said this: We love puns too Ms De but this one is totally imisplaced. Uniform/official not ours. We expect better from responsible citizens like you. https://t.co/OcKOoHO5bX â€” Mumbai Police (@MumbaiPolice) February 21, 2017 \nIt is perhaps time for De to realise that this is 2017, and puns about fat people are a passÃ©. \nTalking and making fun of people's bodies is not something new to De. In April 2016, when Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton was in India, De had, in her infinite wisdom, opined that the Royal did not have the body to wear a saree. \nIn one of her columns, she had said , \" Khair , let's count our blessings, ji . Kate has skipped wearing a saree. Her waist is perfect for crinoline ball gowns from \"Gone with the Wind\". But a saree needs curves. A saree demands a derriere. Kate has none. Thank God, some misguided fashion guru has spared her and us so far.\" \nMore recently in January this year, De faced much flak on Twitter when she asked External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj to stop tweeting. Sushma Swaraj : Resolution for 2017 - Keep calm and stop tweeting. â€” Shobhaa De (@DeShobhaa) January 13, 2017 \nAnd this is how Twitter ensured that De was aware that the joke's really on her: Lol! Even Mumbai police is giving it back to Shobhaa De ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ https://t.co/XON9CNhJTc", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T11:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:50:35.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
