It took Barack Obama 32 months in office before his approval fell enough to match Mr. Trump’s current net rating of negative four. It was 41 months before George W. Bush’s dropped that far.\nMr. Trump’s approval rating may have been worse were it not for support from a surprising corner of the electorate. His job performance won positive reviews from 55% of respondents who had voted for a third-party candidate in November, who didn’t vote at all or said they supported Mr. Trump mostly to oppose Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. The Journal/NBC News pollsters called this group “the critical middle” in the nation’s partisan warfare and said it accounted for just over one-third of all respondents.\n“This is what’s holding him together,” said Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster who worked on the survey.\nWithin this group, a majority applauded the president’s handling of the economy and said the administration’s early missteps were typical of any new White House—a contrast with Americans overall, who saw the problems as unique to Mr. Trump.\nAsked to answer in their own words, poll respondents who approved of Mr. Trump’s job performance explained their feelings by saying the president was delivering on campaign promises to bring back jobs and close the borders, and that he needed to be given a chance by the media and others instead of rushing to judgment.\nThose who disapproved said Mr. Trump lacks the temperament, competency and qualifications to be president.\nThe negative feelings toward Mr. Trump—47% said they viewed him unfavorably, compared with 43% who held favorable views—marked an extraordinary break from recent history. Just 19% saw Mr. Obama in a negative light at this point in 2009, similar to the 23% who viewed Mr. Bush unfavorably in 2001.\n“What we are arguably seeing in this survey is the continued hardening of the partisan lines, with no distinction between the campaign and the non-campaign,” said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster who conducted the survey with Democratic pollster Fred Yang.\n© mike theiler/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images Mr. Trump’s standing with Americans has improved somewhat since the end of a particularly negative campaign season. The 43% who have a positive view of him was the largest share since the Journal/NBC News poll started asking about Mr. Trump in 1990.\nBut a series of missteps and scandals in office—from the resignation of the president’s national security adviser to a court-ordered halt of his decision to suspend travel from seven Muslim-majority countries due to terrorism concerns—are mostly of his own doing, most Americans believe.\nAsked about the source of his early challenges, 52% agreed the troubles were “unique to this administration and suggest real problems,’’ while 43% said the growing pains were typical of any new president.\nThose misfires may have been priced into Mr. Trump’s standing with Americans. Asked how the new president is doing on the job, 57% said it is about what they expected.\n“Despite what commentators on both sides of the aisle agree was a rough start, his numbers on key measurements did not drop—from their admittedly mediocre start—since January,” Mr. McInturff said.\nWhat’s holding Mr. Trump down, to a certain degree, is his own approach to the job. Asked to judge his character and policies, 59% said they don’t like him personally. That is higher than for the previous five presidents.\nBut when asked about policies, the numbers flip. Putting aside their personal feelings about Mr. Trump, 47% said they approve of most of his policies. That is a higher rate than Ronald Reagan recorded in January 1987, or George W. Bush in March 2006. Among three previous Republican presidents, only George H.W. Bush had a higher rating, in October 1991, with 50% approving.\nWhen pollsters tested one of the lines from Mr. Trump’s inaugural speech—asking whether a small group in Washington had “reaped the rewards of government, while the people have borne the cost”—an overwhelming majority of 86% said they agreed.\n“I thought this would test well, but never thought it would reach 86%,” Mr. McInturff said.\nHe added that while Mr. Trump’s speeches are often described as dark and apocalyptic, many individual lines resonate powerfully with many Americans. That may continue with Mr. Trump’s address to Congress on Tuesday.\nThe poll suggested that the public may be sympathetic to some of Mr. Trump’s recent attacks on the media. A majority of adults, 51%, said the media has been too critical of the president, while 41% said the press has been fair and objective.\nWhen a similar question was asked in the third year of Mr. Clinton’s first term, 45% said news coverage of the president was fairly well balanced, while about one-third said it was biased against Mr. Clinton and 16% said it was biased in his favor.\nAiding Mr. Trump’s approval rating was the fact that Americans are slowly becoming more optimistic about the country and the economy. Asked about the course of the country, 40% said the nation is headed in the right direction. That is up from 33% in December, and 18% in July.\nA plurality of Americans, 41%, continue to believe that the U.S. economy will improve, a postelection shift that followed three years in which most Americans expected economic prospects to remain stagnant. Among those who are anticipating improvement, 73% credit the expected gains mostly to Mr. Trump’s policies, while 20% say it would result from the normal ebb and flow of the business cycle.\nSome 60% of Americans now say they’re hopeful and optimistic about the future of the country, up 4 percentage points from December. Just 40% are worried and pessimistic, slightly lower than in other recent Journal/NBC News polls.\nThat optimism is reflected in a sharp change in how Americans view major institutions in the country. For the first time since 2002, a majority of adults, or 52%, say they don’t believe the nation’s economic and political systems are stacked against them. An improved outlook among Republicans is largely responsible for the change.\n“His ratings on the traditional metrics of a president, including job rating, start off in shockingly low terrain, but his voters wanted change,” Mr. McInturff said. “He’s not another president; he’s their president. And Americans overall do view him more positively than negatively on being effective, bringing change to D.C., being firm and decisive, direct and straightforward—and perhaps most importantly, dealing with the economy.”\nThe Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll was based on nationwide telephone interviews of 1,000 adults conducted from Feb. 18-22. Overall, the data’s margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. The margin of error for subgroups is larger.\nWrite to Michael C.
