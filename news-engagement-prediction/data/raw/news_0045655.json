Fair enough if he means Canning Town, but I won’t hear a word against Plaistow.\n“I’m sorry your wife was killed in one such action,” he adds to Archer with the slimeball politesse that TV Nazis use when trying to ingratiate themselves with defeated foes. “I’m afraid the blame is Winston Churchill’s.” Which, even if true, is scant consolation.\nI know this adaptation of Len Deighton’s thriller novel SS-GB (BBC1) demands to be taken very seriously, but, like Britons resisting Nazi rule in this drama, I can’t help rebelling against its oppressive strictures – if only by laughing at it a little. Even though the Standartenführer shares the surname of Leicester City’s terrifying present-day German enforcer Robert Huth and even though he is played by a German (Lars Eidinger) and directed by a German (Philipp Kadelbach), his sinister yet importunately chummy patter reminds me of something utterly British – Adrian Edmondson’s turn as Baron von Richthofen in Blackadder. I couldn’t stop giggling in memory of how the Baron tells captured Blackadder and Baldrick of the degrading punishment awaiting them ( teaching home economics to girls in Heidelberg ), before adding sympathetically: “I can tell you how much you’re suffering by your long faeces.”\nRight. Serious face back on. In SS-GB, the worst has happened. Blighty’s last line of defence (no, not Captain Mainwaring’s Walmington-on-Sea platoon ) has been breached. Germany has won the Battle of Britain, Churchill has reportedly given his firing squad two fingers before being executed, and Germans in S&M leather wear wander round as if they own the place. Which, intolerably, they do.\nSS-GB’s premise is not quite as humiliating as the last time I saw my home city conquered by boneheads, namely last year’s film London Has Fallen , in which Britain’s security services studied their fingernails while Gerard Butler’s US special agent single-handedly took out the terrorist trash who had blown up the city, but it’s still hard to take. As happened to New York in Amazon’s adaptation of Philip K Dick’s The Man in the High Castle , London has to suffer the indignity of CGI swastika banners dangling from its leading monuments.\nPart of me wonders if, in adapting this 1978 novel now, the BBC is unwittingly supplying Brexit propaganda. SS-GB may seem to be counterfactual history but it serves, too, as allegory of the all-too-real German domination Theresa May will trigger article 50 to escape.\nInto SS-GB’s glum milieu wanders Sam Riley as Detective Archer, looking substantially as he did as Joy Division singer Ian Curtis in Anton Corbijn’s 2007 film Control – long coat, dark shirt and Macclesfield-moody.\nBut who is the enigmatic Archer – a Nazi collaborator, as his former lover and co-worker Sylvia Manning suspects? Or is Archer, given that his wife died in battle against the Nazis, vengeful and working from within to bring down Britain’s fascist regime?\nEither way, Archer is investigating the murder of an antiques dealer seemingly bumped off by black market rivals. But his death isn’t all it seems. The antiques dealer is really a resistance fighter.\nAll this makes for a terrifically engaging thriller, but it’s marred by dialogue that is sometimes inaudible (as with Happy Valley, Taboo and 10 Rillington Place, I’m using subtitles) and, when audible, often hackneyed thriller speak.\nNo matter. I’m intrigued enough by the drama’s many riddles to stick with it. I’m not sure, for instance, if Sylvia (Maeve Dermody, reminding me of a young Keeley Hawes) is Jewish but the fact that her parents have both been killed suggests she might well be, as does the fury with which she torches the box of yellow stars with a cigarette before quitting her job and joining the resistance. That said, would a Jewish woman in 1941 Europe have draped herself in a swastika flag as Sylvia did after having sex with Archer in the first reel? Unlikely.\nWhat we do know is that Kate Bosworth is playing New York Times journalist Barbara Barga, in London ostensibly to research a piece about Americans living under Nazi rule, but really working undercover. In this counterfactual 1941, too many women are doomed to play either sex workers or mysterious sirens like Barga. Is she America’s secret weapon against Hitler, or Mata Hari with a typewriter? Uncertain, but the safe money says she will replace Sylvia in Archer’s affections by this time next week. The narrative moves of this thriller may be satisfyingly mystifying, but so far its sexual politics are annoyingly predictable.\nTelevision Last night's TV Second world war reviews  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T14:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T09:47:39.821+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
