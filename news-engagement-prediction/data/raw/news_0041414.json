I saw more than 20 people lying on the ground. Most of them were dead and the market was totally destroyed,\" eyewitness Abdulle Omar told the Reuters news agency. \nOther witnesses said the bomb went off at a busy junction where soldiers, civilians and traders congregate. \n\"There were many small scale traders alongside the road and teashops and restaurants. There were also members of the security forces and shoppers and the blast was so huge that it killed nearly 20 people, most of them civilians,\" Sumayo Moalim told the AFP news agency. \nThe attack underlines the magnitude of the challenge faced by the new president whose administration relies heavily on international support and does not control all of Somalia. \nTroops from the African Union forced al-Shabab out of Mogadishu in 2011, but the militants remain powerful in some rural areas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T21:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T17:17:57.412+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
