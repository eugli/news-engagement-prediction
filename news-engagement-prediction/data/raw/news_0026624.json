But most have probably forgotten about the time he was forced to wear No. 12 — without a name. Michael Jordan wore No. 12 on Feb. 14, 1990. (Courtesy of NBA.com) \nUpdated at 3:54 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 3:54 p.m. ET \nLong before Tom Brady experienced jersey theft, Michael Jordan and the Bulls had to improvise after His Airness' No. 23 jersey went missing before a game in Orlando. \nIt was on this day in 1990, after a frantic but fruitless search for the iconic No. 23, that Jordan was forced to wear a nameless No. 12 for a game against the Magic. A long-forgotten image, yes, but one the NBA doesn't want anyone to forget — lest fans use their $300 on something else. \nYes, the NBA, always in search of a marketing opportunity, has made a replica version of that No. 12 available for purchase so basketball fans everywhere can spend a bunch of money to relive an obscure blip in hardwood history while also looking like they bought a surplus Bulls jersey that was accidentally produced without a name.

But if the thief was hoping to throw Jordan off his game that night, it didn't work. \nNot that it mattered what number was on Jordan's back that night, or that his name was missing. This was prime Jordan. Everyone in the arena and watching on TV knew exactly who dropped 49 points on the Magic that night. It was a typical '90s-era Jordan performance, even though the Magic won 135-129.
