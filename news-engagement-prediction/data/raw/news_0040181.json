Kendall's outfit had a rock chick vibe (Photo: WENN.com) Bella flashed her boobs in a barely there top (Photo: WENN.com) The girls were snapped at Sexy Fish restaurant (Photo: FameFlynet) Kendall kept a baseball hat on all night (Photo: WENN.com) \nKeeping Up With The Kardashians star Kendall, 21, wore skin tight leather leggings, a music tee shirt and an oversized red fluffy coat, teamed with stiletto boots and a baseball cap. \nBella, 20, meanwhile, went one further, flashing her boobs in a barely there mesh top, teamed with grungy black jeans covered in patches. She opted for biker boots, a long black coat and beret hat to finish her look. \nAlso present was Taylor Hill, 20, who followed in Bella’s footsteps by letting it all hang out in a lacy bra covered by a sheer black top. They went clubbing after their meal (Photo: FameFlynet) Stella and Taylor were also at the gathering (Photo: WENN.com) Hailey teamed jogging bottoms with heels (Photo: WENN.com) \nElsewhere, Stella Maxwell 26, chose to flash her toned abs in a black crop top. \nThe final member of the group was Hailey Baldwin, 20, who looked positively demure in comparison, wearing an off the shoulder white shirt and grey tracksuit bottoms. \nLFW kicked off on Thursday and continues until Tuesday. \nMeanwhile, reality star turned model Kendall revealed last week what supermodels REALLY eat backstage at Fashion Week.
