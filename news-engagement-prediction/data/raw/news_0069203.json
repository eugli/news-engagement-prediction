While most teens are focused on the latest trends, or whatever the kids are into these days, Depp is always expanding her wardrobe to include a mix of vintage designer threads, too. We recently saw supermodel Kendall Jenner at London’s coolest thrift store, fittingly dressed in a retro red fringed jacket , and now it seems that Depp is continuing the throwback movement in Paris. Seen earlier today en route to the Chanel showroom for a Fall 2017 runway fitting, Depp covered up in a vintage Courrèges motorcycle look with a subtle ladylike twist. Depp carried a quilted Chanel bag in canary yellow with gold hardware detail that recalled the vanity boxes of a decade past, furthermore adding a pop of contrast and plenty of It accessory status. Depp did well to layer her statement-making outerwear over a simple camel knit sweater that didn’t detract from the color-block message up top. Sleek black trousers and a pair of ankle boots with a sturdy block heel placed the look on solid, stylish ground. Here’s hoping her fellow youths will follow suit.
