Rain and cool weather have been the talk of the town with many people having spent their time outside home this weekend. Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, took some breathtaking pictures of Palm Jumeirah on Saturday that prove that come rain or shine, Dubai always glitters. The Crown Prince took these shots between offering condolences to UAE martyrs' families and attending the UAE Drone for Good Awards . His brother Sheikh Mansoor was piloting the chopper. Here are some photos from Sheikh Hamdan's Instagram profile. Recently, he took to Instagram to thank the valiant workers of Dubai for their efforts after the storm. In a series of Instagram stories, the Crown Prince documented local workers as they restored an uprooted tree to its former standing. Many trees toppled over when the UAE was lashed by strong winds and heavy rains. In some areas, the stormy weather even caused infrastructure to topple over and the Metro service to be closed temporarily. He even took a moment to send out an inspiring message to his 4.8 million followers on Instagram asking them to accept falling down as a part of life. Over the next few days, the weather will continue to be windy and dusty in few parts of UAE, the National Center of Meteorology and Seismology (NCMS) said on Sunday. Residents are advised to be careful while setting out on the roads.
