John Boozman, R-Ark., pause during the National Prayer Breakfast, Thursday, Feb. 2, 2017, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) \nWASHINGTON • The Fixer in Chief has got this. \n“The world is in trouble, but we’re going to straighten it out. OK?” President Donald Trump said at Thursday’s National Prayer Breakfast . “That’s what I do. I fix things. We’re going to straighten it out.” \nThe Negotiator in Chief warned Americans to be ready for more tough talk with foreign leaders — even those leading America’s oldest and best friends. \nLike the one last week with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull that, by multiple reports, got testy over an Obama administration promise to accept about 1,250 refugees from Iran, Iraq and other countries stranded on islands off Australia. The Obama administration had determined conditions were inhumane for the refugees. \nThe call ended with Trump declaring, “That was the worst call by far” of all of his with foreign leaders, according to The Washington Post . \nBut the Reassurer in Chief said Thursday not to worry there, either. To think of his actions as the art of the deal. He said he’s tired of the U.S. getting bad deals, even with friends like Australia, which is one of a handful of countries that share the deepest of state secrets with the U.S. \n“When you hear about the tough phone calls I’m having, don’t worry about it,” he said, to applause, at the annual prayer service, a tradition started under Dwight Eisenhower. “It’s time we’re going to be a little tough, folks.” \nLater, the Negotiator in Chief reappeared. \n“I said (to Turnbull), ‘Why, why are we doing this?’” Trump said. “So we’ll see what happens.” \n“We have some wonderful allies and in the end, we are going to keep it that way,” Trump said, segueing to Reassurer in Chief. “But we have to be treated fairly, also.” \nHours before, the Tweeter in Chief had appeared at the crack of dawn. \n“Iran was on its last legs and ready to collapse until the U.S. came along and gave it a lifeline in the form of the Iran Deal: $150 billion,” Trump tweeted. \nHe was referring to a deal forged by his predecessor to stop Iran from building a nuclear weapon in exchange for lifting sanctions and thawing frozen financial assets. His administration had announced this week it had put Iran “on notice” for any breaches in previous arms agreements, and the Commander in Chief said Thursday that a military option was not off the table. \nThe Celebrity in Chief was out and about Thursday, too. \nIn his prayer breakfast remarks, Trump doubled down on tweets critical of “The Celebrity Apprentice,” the NBC “reality” show he once ran, by joking that he would say a prayer for current host Arnold Schwarzenegger, to boost Arnold’s lagging ratings. \nLater, in a meeting with Harley-Davidson motorcycle execs, the Commentator in Chief again extolled how he shocked the world and won Rust Belt states on Nov. 8, including Harley’s home of Wisconsin, defying prognosticators. The president does this frequently, often in situations that raise eyebrows, sometimes to the point that his critics say he is distractedly obsessed with it. \nThe Trader in Chief then said he had problems with the North American Free Trade Agreement. \nThe Cleric in Chief surprised the prayer breakfast with a threat to “totally destroy” the Johnson Amendment, another Eisenhower-era legacy designed to prevent religious leaders from endorsing politicians from the pulpit or risk losing their tax-exempt status. \nIt was passed in 1954 by a Republican Congress and signed by a Republican president, and the fact that some Republicans now want it repealed says much about the evolution of the GOP on the constitutional and traditional separation of church and state. \nThis was one day of the Trump era. \nIn his first two weeks on the job, Donald Trump has roiled official Washington and the embassies that populate the tree-canopied northwestern quarter of the city — an Officialdom that had become accustomed to “No Drama Obama” and an America that had aspired to lead from behind. \nAll administrations have pace. This one’s, so far, has been frenetic. \nThrough it all, President Trump has been one thing above all else: \nDisruptor in Chief. Political Fix from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch \nBe informed.
