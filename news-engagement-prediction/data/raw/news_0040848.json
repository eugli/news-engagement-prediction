She was 69. \nJournalist Joshua Prager, who is working on a book about McCorvey, says she died Saturday morning at an assisted living center in Katy, Texas. \nAlthough McCorvey was the plaintiff in Roe v. Wade, she later became an anti-abortion activist. \nShe revealed her real name in the 1980s. She also said she had lied when she said her 1969 pregnancy that set Roe v. Wade in motion was the result of a rape. As the court case progressed, she gave birth and gave her daughter up for adoption.
