Enzo , no character is safe from the chopping block for the series finale. Julie Plec (@julieplec) February 20, 2017 \nJulie says that another main character will die. \nNoooo! \nAnd if there was any doubt, the final scene in the series will be in the most iconic spot. @ForeverLoveDE the Salvatore house Julie Plec (@julieplec) February 20, 2017 \nOf course, it’s the Salvatore residence. It just feels right. \nIf you subscribe to the fan theory that The Vampire Diaries will end with Stelena together, you might be interested in what Julie says. @sashasIove I can't answer that without being spoilery, sorry. — Julie Plec (@julieplec) February 20, 2017 \nHmm, what does that mean? Is that a yes? Or is it a hard no? Ugh we’re going to have to wait to find out. \nAs for the other Salvatore brother OTP, Julie can give us more facts. @_LightToMyDark They will come face to face. Julie Plec (@julieplec) February 20, 2017 \nYes! Damon and Elena will finally come face to face, so Nina will definitely come back as Elena, if that was in question with all these doppelgangers running around. \nSpeaking of these doppelgangers, be prepared because one of the favorites is definitely returning! @TVDFRA Oh hah, are you from France? In which case, oui. Julie Plec (@julieplec) February 20, 2017 \nIt seems that Katherine will find a way to escape hell, just like Kai did. \nOne person we know definitely won’t be getting a happy ending is the ultimate Big Bad. Julie Plec (@julieplec) February 20, 2017 \nLooks like Damon trying to get Kai to find redemption for his sins is not going to work out… \nAs for other villains-turned-protagonists, The Vampire Diaries will refer to The Originals in the finale. @wbalkcom a tiny tiny bit Julie Plec (@julieplec) February 20, 2017 \nKlaroline shippers , get excited because this could mean some face-to-face time. \nCandice Accola already told us that there will be some flash forwards, and Julie confirmed that as well. Now we’re basically just nail biting until it all comes to a close. \nThe Vampire Diaries Season 8 airs Fridays at 8 p.m. ET on The CW. \nCheck out more of Wetpaint ’s coverage of The Vampire Diaries Season 8 below: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:48:29.508+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
