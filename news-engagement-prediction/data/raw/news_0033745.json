Sitting front row tonight at the Grammy Awards to take in her mother’s deific performance, Blue was actually paying homage to another great musical legend. Suited up in a pink custom Gucci pantsuit, the pint-size style star layered her look with a frilled high-neck white blouse underneath a miniature rendition of the very flouncy top that Prince made his fashion calling card over the years. Demonstrating her command of music history, Blue fastened the top with a diamond brooch akin to the one Prince donned in Purple Rain . She did, however, forgo a Purple One–inspired pompadour—though her sleek, high ponytail did the foppish rock legend plenty of justice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T09:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T07:31:13.699+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
