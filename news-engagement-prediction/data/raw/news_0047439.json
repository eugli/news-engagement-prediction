Now they are backed into a corner. Former NFL WR Terrell Owens (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 1:26 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 1:26 p.m. ET \nThe tipping point for Terrell Owens’ Hall of Fame chances was the drops chart . \nOwens is never going to get into the Hall of Fame. That sealed it. \nThat really isn’t that extreme a reaction to that chart, slipped into Peter King’s weekly column at The MMQB on Monday, but tweeted out on its own. \nNo time will be wasted deciphering it, putting it into context or even mocking it that much. (In all fairness, Pro Football Talk mocked the entire \"drops\" debate flawlessly already.) Ironically, King in that item declared not only does Owens deserve to be in Canton, but drops are not a good reason to exclude him. \nBut that chart got out there for a full viewing, anyway. From 2006-08, Owens dropped balls at more than twice the rate of the 8 most productive pass-catchers in the NFL. https://t.co/AkEAO3vvoP pic.twitter.com/TqDpHSO85g — The MMQB (@theMMQB) February 20, 2017 \nAnd it pushed the no-T.O. voting block even deeper into a corner. \nThey can’t walk this back now. This entire campaign the last two weeks to earnestly defend an indefensible stance has left them no exit point. \nMORE: Dan Fouts is part of the problem \nThe voters who pushed the \" bad teammate \" theme so hard, who directly debated Owens himself on Twitter, who played the \" don’t you know who I am \" card when challenged on their credibility, and who then pivoted to the \" too many drops ” angle when their first argument went up in flames — how do those voters now put Owens in next year? \nAny time soon? Any time at all? \nThis attempt at public explanation of a yay-or-nay vote in this Hall is unprecedented. Every other snub, going back decades, has been shrouded in mystery, not because the voters have never been asked to justify their vote, but because they've never been so aggressive in giving it. \nKen Stabler, Cris Carter, Michael Irvin, Art Monk, Jerry Kramer — everybody knows the names on the historic wait list, but who has ever been explicit about saying, \"You wanna know why? I'll tell you why, in more detail than you ever dreamed.\" \nA drops chart. That’s breaking new ground. \nTransparency is never a bad thing; it's the ideal, in fact. But be careful what you wish for. \nOnce you truly go on the record and say, “Here is exactly, specifically, why the guy with the second-most receiving yards in NFL history and the third-most touchdown catches, the guy who played in the Super Bowl on a broken leg, got two straight thumbs-down” … you cannot turn around in a year, or two, or five, and say, “OK, he's not a bad teammate anymore.” \nOr, \"Playing for five teams isn’t a deal-breaker.\" \nOr, \"Bitter contract disputes don’t really disqualify you.\" \nOr, \"Dropped passes … never mind, he kind of caught a lot of them, too.\" \nOwens’ pluses and supposed minuses won’t change by next February. Can a voter's mind, or perception, or pulled-out-of-thin-air criteria, change by then — without flushing every claim to integrity down the toilet? \nSeriously, it can't, now that all this is out there in the open. All the information that was consciously chosen, or rejected, or ignored, or blown completely out of proportion. You don’t get to say a year later, \"Well, actually …\" \nEverybody who committed themselves to this cause, the notion of straightening all you rubes out about the real T.O., got too defensive about it. They've cast themselves, the Hall’s credibility and the voting process into doubt, just to rationalize a poorly thought-out decision. \nThey can’t backpedal their way out of this. \nAnd they can’t go back in time as if it never happened and vote in Owens. \nThis isn’t just a snub anymore. It’s a lockout. And the drops chart was the last deadbolt to turn.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:34:12.114+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
