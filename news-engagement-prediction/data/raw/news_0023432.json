Because it was the Mavericks and because Dirk Nowitzki is Dirk Nowitzki, he was heavily involved. First, Nowitzki gave the Mavericks a 108-107 lead with this three in transition. The celebration was even better. — Matt Ellentuck (@mellentuck) February 8, 2017 That shot came with just 38 seconds left, but Portland’s C.J. McCollum had an answer. McCollum made back-to-back buckets for Portland, the latter giving the Blazers 111-110 lead with 12 seconds left. But, Dirk wasn’t done. Seconds later, he did this.

Yet again, McCollum had other ideas. CJ Blazers win! pic.twitter.com/uXE4vHKm6C — CSN Northwest (@CSNNW) February 8, 2017 Five made shots, six points each in the final 40 seconds and one of the best finishes of the season.
