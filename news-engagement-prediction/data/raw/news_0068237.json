Include ten portions of fruits, veggies in your daily diet By Zee Media Bureau | Last Updated: Friday, February 24, 2017 - 00:25 0 Follow @ZeeNews \nLondon: One should include 10 portions or 800 grammes of fruit and vegetables daily as it help reduce the risk of early deaths. \nResearchers said that eating ten portions of fruits and veggies may prevent approximately 7.8 million premature deaths worldwide every year. \nThe results revealed that eating up to 800g fruit and vegetables a day - or 10 portions - was associated with a 24 per cent reduced risk of heart disease, a 33 per cent reduced risk of stroke, a 28 per cent reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, a 13 per cent reduced risk of total cancer, and a 31 per cent reduction in dying prematurely. MUST READ Premature deaths by non-communicable disease high in India: WHO \nLead author Dagfinn Aune from Imperial College, London, said \"We wanted to investigate how much fruit and vegetables you need to eat to gain the maximum protection against disease, and premature death. Our results suggest that although five portions of fruit and vegetables is good, ten a day is even better\". \nResearchers have found that apples and pears, citrus fruits, salads and green leafy vegetables such as spinach, lettuce and chicory, and cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cabbage and cauliflower, may reduce the risk of specific diseases. \nAune added, \"Fruit and vegetables have been shown to reduce cholesterol levels, blood pressure and to boost the health of our blood vessels and immune system. This may be due to the complex network of nutrients they hold. For instance they contain many antioxidants, which may reduce DNA damage and lead to a reduction in cancer risk\". \nFor the findings, the team conducted a meta-analysis of all available research in populations worldwide, included up to 2 million people, and assessed up to 43,000 cases of heart disease, 47,000 cases of stroke, 81,000 cases of cardiovascular disease, 112,000 cancer cases and 94,000 deaths. \nThe study was published in the journal International Journal of Epidemiology. \n(With IANS inputs) First Published: Thursday, February 23, 2017 - 23:24 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:20:19.902+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
