I think he pinned a lot of hope on it. Passing it would mean his lie was long gone and behind him and he could get on with his life.” 3 Sam was working as a mental health support worker \nSam, of Carlisle, had an English degree from Northumbria University and was a support worker for people with mental health problems. \nBut he suffered from anxiety and depression himself and had received treatment. \nHis girlfriend Tia Norman, 19, paid tribute to him at the inquest saying: “He was eccentric and he wanted to please everyone.” related stories CASANOVA COP UP FOR CHOP Police chief who shacked up with WPC 15 years his junior suspended for 'gross misconduct' NEED A HAND, SIR?

You have good days and bad days. You can’t really put it into one word. Sometimes you take one step forward and two steps back.” \nHis mother Mary, 48, said: “Sometimes you have to take an hour at a time. \nIt was just getting through that hour and the next hour.” Mary struggled to cope after Sam’s death in August 2015 and her cousin suggested she take up running. \nShe joined a local club and started doing the popular weekly park runs. 3 Sam had received treatment for depression and anxiety \nShe said: “I think if I hadn’t started running I’d have been in a terrible state. I think the running has really helped. \n“It helped with the psychological pain that I felt because the running was physically hurting me. It was kind of transforming it. It gave me a release. \n“It’s really hard to cope with day to day stuff. \n“We just miss him so much. Christmases are difficult, birthdays are difficult. You think of a joke and you think Sam would think that’s hilarious and then you realise you can’t tell him.” For confidential emotional support call the Samaritans helpline 24 hours a day, 365 days a year by dialling 116 123.
