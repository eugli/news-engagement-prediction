Curt Schilling backs off his defense of Milo Yiannopoulos. (Steven Senne/AP) \nMilo Yiannopoulos disinvited from CPAC after pedophilia comments \n“Let me see if I have this right. @lenadunham child molestor Woody Allen, sex with a minor, Roman Polanski, rapist, But Milo is the problem?” he tweeted. Let me see if I have this right. @lenadunham child molestor Woody Allen, sex with a minor, Roman Polanski, rapist, But Milo is the problem? — Curt Schilling (@gehrig38) February 21, 2017 \nAfter going back and forth with people on Twitter for about half an hour, Schilling suddenly decided to plead ignorance, claiming he had not heard the recent audio of Yiannopolous’ comments and eventually apologized. \n“UPDATE! I had NO idea of the video/audio of Milo's interview which he defends and hides the identity of pedophiles. There's no circumstance in any setting ever where protection of a molester is appropriate and IMO legal? But I apologize if it appeared in any way I was ‘defending” that sort of commentary. I’ll accept any and all abuse thrown my way for not thoroughly going through ALL the material before responding,” he said over three different tweets. UPDATE!
