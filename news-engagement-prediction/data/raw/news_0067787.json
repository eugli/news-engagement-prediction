Kendall was with her mother the day Kris wore the suit for a day wandering around the French capital in September 2014. The detailing, right down to the shiny quality of the lapel - though the Moschino version comes in a more unusual lacquered strip effect - was eerily similar. Coincidence? The cut of Kendall's sharp Moschino suit, with the cigarette-style trousers and shiny-lapelled fitted black jacket, looked very like one sported by her mother in Paris in 2014 Distinctive: The 21-year-old model wore the jacket with a bare chest, highlighting its plunging line, and teamed it with statement crafted silver earrings for a business-like look And Kendall was not the only one garnering attention for her distinctive look on the catwalk. Fergie looked sensational in the kinky ensemble which she teamed with dominatrix-style mid-length lace up boots. The 41-year-old singer strutted her stuff on the catwalk in a bondage-inspired khaki cardigan worn over a black mini dress. Sexy: Superstar singer Fergie strutted her stuff in a bondage-inspired cardigan at the Moschino AW17 presentation for Milan Fashion Week on Thursday The Grammy award-winning singer wore her bleach blonde hair in sexy tousled waves for the show. She paused at the end of the runway and fired a sultry gaze at the cameras before sweeping around. The designer's choice of a polo-neck dress under the jacket both highlighted its detail and added a sexy concealed element. Fergalicious! The Grammy award-winning singer looked phenomenal in a khaki belted coat and wore her bleach blonde hair in sexy tousled waves for the show While earlier in the show Kendall had displayed a very different look - more cardboard than chic. She joined the Hadid sisters in parading in recyclable materials - with the Kardashian even pulling off looking like a parcel with her jauntily angled cardboard box hat. Even when adorned with strips of reflective material designed to look like tape, the reality star somehow became vision of beauty as passed the star-studded crowd. Terrific trio: Kendall Jenner ensured all eyes would be on her as she walked in the Moschino AW17 presentation for Milan Fashion Week alongside best friend Gigi Hadid and her younger sister Bella on Thursday Blonde bombshell! Gazing steely-eyed down the runway, Gigi's golden locks were worn in a stylish bouffant that drew more attention to her eye-catching features Dazzling: Gigi and Bella rocked uber glamorous ensembles on the runway as they made a quick change out of their cardboard box inspired ensembles into a second more conventional look Flaunting her enviably long legs, she donned a thigh-grazing mini skirt, whilst a pair of nude patent heels aided in giving her an extra boost as she teetered along. However, the most quirky item of the ensemble was a small hat positioned jauntily on the side of her head which resembled a small cardboard box wrapped in net. Having already walked in New York, London and Paris fashion weeks, the trio of stunners have seen and modelled most collections for all the upcoming designers. What a load of rubbish! Other models stormed the runway in bin bag liner inspired dresses themed around responsible fashion and the importance of recycling Big and bold: Impressive shapes and colours made an appearance at the ever-exciting show, including a hat made from the wheel of a bicycle - complete with a spoke spike What a candelabra! One model managed to balance an (unlit) giant candelabra on her head as she carefully made her way down the runway in a sheer lace dress Two of a kind: Vogue Japan editor Anna Dello Russo (left) and Jodie Harsh (right) were among the glamorous guests Share or comment on this article 273 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T08:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T15:29:20.652+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
