(Getty Images) \nUpdated at 2 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 2 a.m. ET \nThe Colts' locker room will be a whole lot quieter and a lot less funny in 2017. \nIndy punter and class clown Pat McAfee is retiring from the NFL after eight seasons. He broke the news at midnight Wednesday on the show \"Barstool Rundown,\" which aired on Comedy Central. He posted a retirement letter on Twitter early Thursday. \nMORE: Ranking the Super Bowl winners, 1-50 \n\"I understand people might be upset about the fact that I won't be kicking balls on 4th downs for the Colts anymore, and I can understand that,\" McAfee wrote, \"but please know that I am very excited for the future, and the spotlight I will be able to place on Indianapolis.\" \nThat spotlight McAfee referred to? It will emanate from his role as a content creator for Barstool Sports, which he has joined now that his whole football gig is over. McAfee said Barstool has given him his own studio in downtown Indianapolis to create TV and radio content. (It looks as though McAfee wasn't bluffing when he was talking about starting a punter podcast) . \nMORE: Biggest, best and longest Super Bowl plays of all time \nMcAfee finishes his career as a two-time Pro Bowler, including in 2016. He declined to play in the Pro Bowl this season after having his third knee surgery in four years. Over his career, he averaged 46.4 yards per punt, completed one of two passes for 35 yards, and rushed twice for 18 yards. \nBut McAfee will always be more remembered for his antics than his play. Whether it was celebrating the firing of Colts general manager Ryan Grigson, joking about 4/20 and getting drug-tested the next day, or using two celebrations for the same play, McAfee knew how to have fun with his job. \nNow he'll get paid to have fun.
