Man who targeted girls in Waitrose and and at Hamleys jailed for sex offences \nMrs Kuehn says the dog has a ‘therapeutic effect’ on her and that she bought it during a stressful period of her life. \nThe couple claim they were given permission to bring Vinnie by the property’s freeholders, shortly before their move in November 2015. \nBut now they are facing a legal battle, as Victory Place, the management company, claims the lease has a ‘no-pets policy’. (Picture: Smartpicsuk) \nThey have been fighting the case in court with the support of human and dog supporters. \nIn court Mrs Kuehn, a recruitment consultant, told the court how she first viewed the property in June 2014 when Vinnie was two-years-old. Tube strike starts tonight: Here's what you need to know \nShe said: ‘When we were looking for a property all the agencies that we were registered with were aware that we had a dog and we were only interested in looking for properties with leases that permitted this.’ \nShe told the court that nobody at Victory Place had made her aware of their ‘no-pets’ policy until after she bought the penthouse flat. \nMrs Kuehn told the court she her made enquiries with estate agent to check it would be ok to bring Vinnie and was told it would not be a problem. (Picture: Smartpicsuk) (Picture: Smartpicsuk) \nThe freeholder granted consent and they were provided with a licence. \nMrs Kuehn told the court how the concierge had approached her and told her of the no-dog rule when he saw her with Vinnie. \nWhen the management firm Victory Place told her she would have to remove the dog, the couple refused. \nMrs Kuehn told the court how the dog had a ‘therapeutic effect’ on her. \nShe told the court: ‘The reason why I got the dog in the first place, it was a particularly stressful time in my life and there is absolutely no question that my dog has a therapeutic effect. \n‘I was suffering from anxiety and stress and my dog has a therapeutic effect. I would have considered that to be a special circumstance.’ (Picture: Smartpicsuk) (Picture: Smartpicsuk) \nHowever when Ewa Jones, 57, chairwoman of Victory Place, asked for medical evidence Mrs Kuehn refused to provide it. \nShe told the court: ‘I don’t believe it was necessary at that time to provide medical information.’ \nMr Tim Hammond, representing Victory Place, told the court how an AGM was held in February 2016 to vote on whether the no-pets policy should be changed. \nMrs Kuehn posted on a public board to encourage people to turn up and vote. \nBut unfortunately while the meeting saw a large attendance the vote went against her, with 75 votes to retain and enforce the existing policy and just one vote to change it, her own. \nMr Hammond read emails passed onto property manager Felix Densu relating to complaints about Vinnie. (Picture: Smartpicsuk) \nMr Hammond read how one neighbour complained about ‘constant barking’ until 10.30pm on one occasion. \nAnother couple, who lived below the Kuehns complained of a series of incidents over a four month period of ‘whining, loud noise, growling and barking’ from Vinnie. Apps that tell you to walk 10,000 steps a day could be doing more harm than good \nThe freeholders then revoked the couple’s licence in June 2016. \nBut Mrs Kuehn defended Vinnie by saying she would never leave him barking in distress and that she monitored his movements with a camera at home. \nShe said: ‘The first I knew of my dog being an alleged nuisance was when I received a letter from the freeholders. (Picture: Smartpicsuk) \n‘All but one of the alleged incidents took place when were were away from the property and I never leave my dog in distress. \n‘I have a camera to monitor him. There is absolutely no way I would leave my dog in distress. I am here because I love my dog. \n‘If my dog is at home alone, if he moves I get a notification on my phone.’ \nWhen asked about her neighbour’s complaints, she suggested the could have mistaken dogs barking from a park below the flat as coming from Vinnie. (Picture: Smartpicsuk) \nBut she admitted the dog did sometimes bark, telling the court: ‘When I come home from work the dog barks. Royal Navy bans sailors from having porn on ships \n‘He does bark occasionally but he stops when he is told to stop. I would not leave my dog constantly barking.’ \nThe court also heard evidence from retired concierge Aubrey Gittens who claimed Mrs Kuehn had asked him if dogs were allowed in the properties when she was looking around in 2014. \nBut Mrs Kuehn denied this and said the conversation took place after she bought the flat. \nThe hearing is expected to conclude today.
