Titled “Last Supper,” the clip features the film’s surely doomed cast of characters sharing one last James Franco-less meal before entering cryosleep and embarking on what will definitely be a horrifying journey full of grotesque creatures and unsettling androids (at least if the first trailer is anything to go by). Also, if you’re looking for another glimpse of these folks enjoying themselves before being killed by monsters, the Alien Twitter account shared a photo of the whole crew yesterday. \nAlien: Covenant was directed by Ridley Scott and it stars Michael Fassbender, Katherine Waterston, Billy Crudup, and Danny McBride.
