Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway had been given the best actress envelope to open instead of best picture. The accounting firm responsible for the integrity of the awards has taken responsibility for the error and apologized to all involved . \n“It was the weirdest TV finale since ‘Lost,'” Kimmel cracked. \nHe said the plan had been for him to end the Oscar show in the audience, seated next to Matt Damon , when rumblings began that there’d been a mistake. \n“We’re sitting there and we notice some commotion going on,” Kimmel said. “And Matt says, ‘I think I heard the stage manager say they got the winner wrong.’…So you just kind of, well, the host will go onstage and clear this up.

Dunaway, meanwhile, “made quite a getaway,” Kimmel said. \n“Have any of you here ever hosted the Oscars before?” Kimmel asked his Monday night audience. “Well, except for the end – it was a lot of fun.” Share this: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T12:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T08:18:36.764+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
