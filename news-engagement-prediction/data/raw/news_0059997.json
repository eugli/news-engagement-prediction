All touring companies coming to Malvern give Malvern lounge a swerve STAY AWAY !!! Turned away for wearing a hat !!!'. \nBefore long, his eldest son Shane was quick to stand up for him. Wading into the spat, the aspiring musician posted a very sarcastic message which read: 'Rules are rules Dad'. \nRichie then replied with: 'No f**ker in there!'. Shane offered some sarcastic support to his famous father (Photo: ShaneNolan/Twitter) Shane Jr appears to be equally cheeky - just like his father (Photo: ITV) \nOthers were equally vocal. Seeming to miss the obvious comedy content, one fan responded: 'come on young Shane it's a hat,it's winter,it's a pub not Buckingham palace It's ur dad'. \nNolan then added: 'Yeah, always winds me up if the place is dead to be fair'. \nSadly, his contribution didn't temper Shane's annoyance, which continued to manifest on his newsfeed. \nResponding to critics who suggested he simply remove his hat, he spat back: 'No I won't. Was very embarrassing. All the cast turned up to celebrate the great time we've had in Malvern'. \nWhen a local councillor posted: 'A rule is a rule - and Malvern is a wonderful place!' he responded: 'Totally agree but I'd just walked in from out of the cold ....he just wanted to show off in front of staff X'. \nHe even posted an image of himself with Laura Whitmore in faux outrage. 'The hat that offended management at Malvern lounge. Wouldn't mind but it was bleedin' empty!'.
