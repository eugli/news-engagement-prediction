They chased Milo Yiannopoulos off campus and then physically attacked those with whom they disagree. The students turned classical liberalism into the very fascism that they claim to despise. \nChairman Mao once brought about a ‘Cultural Revolution’ that was designed to drive out so called ‘revisionists’ and generally instill fear into the populace. \nWhy? Because he could and he enjoyed power. \nHe encouraged China’s young people to harass professors and officials. Many older people suffered beatings, public humiliation and harassment by Mao’s young fanatics. \nThis helped suppress any dissent—which was always something Mao enjoyed nipping in the bud. We’re now seeing a variation of this on many of today’s college campuses. Students are indoctrinated into a mindset that places feelings above logic and reason. \nThey attack their enemies through violence—not debate. You cannot reason with a fist in the face. The ‘antifa’ students are funded by the billionaire sadist George Soros, who loves power and tyranny just as much as Mao did. \nLike Mao, he also wants to live forever. \nToday, if you are conservative in many of America’s big cities, you had better keep your mouth shut. Wearing a pro-Trump hat invites a violent response from leftist thugs. Politicians on the left such as Tim Kaine are egging it on. \nThe legacy media are also complicit. \nThe global elite could not install Hillary, so they are dancing a tantrum. As a result, Trump is threatened with assassination and his supporters are being physically assaulted. \nWe have also seen Richard Spencer get sucker punched. Whether or not you agree with him is beside the point. \nSpencer does not advocate violence and his free speech should be protected like anyone else’s. It’s time to stop the violence and start listening to each other. Instead of telling the police to ‘stand down’ in the face of reckless hate and violence from the left, the rule of law should be enforced. \nThe First Amendment should be defended.
