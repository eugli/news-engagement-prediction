The mother of Bella Bond, the toddler once known only as “Baby Doe,’’ pleaded guilty Friday to helping her ex-boyfriend dispose of her daughter’s body and will testify against him at his upcoming first-degree murder trial.\nRachelle Bond appeared in Suffolk Superior Court, where she pleaded guilty to a charge of accessory after the fact of murder. She also pleaded guilty to larceny for collecting some $1,400 in welfare benefits after her daughter’s death, which prosecutors said happened in May 2015.\nBond entered the plea before Superior Court Judge Janet Sanders. The judge accepted the plea.\nBond is expected to be the key prosecution witness against her then-boyfriend, Michael P. McCarthy, who is set to go on trial in Suffolk Superior Court later this year.\nMcCarthy has pleaded not guilty and is being held without bail.\nBond allegedly told Boston police after her arrest that McCarthy beat her daughter to death in May 2015 after he had volunteered to put the girl to sleep. Bond said she found him standing over her daughter, whose face had turned swollen and gray, the Globe has reported.\nSuffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley’s office has alleged that McCarthy and Bond dumped the girl’s body in the water off the South Boston waterfront using weights sometime in May 2015. Her body was found in Winthrop on June 25, 2015, triggering a worldwide effort to identify her.\nA friend alerted police in September 2015 that Rachelle Bond had confessed that her daughter had been murdered and thrown into Boston Harbor.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:08:19.128+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
