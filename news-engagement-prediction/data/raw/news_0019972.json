UFC President Dana White confirmed the booking during the 5ive Rounds on ESPN podcast , although the fight has yet to be officially announced by the Las Vegas-based promotion. “(Aldo) is going to fight Max Holloway ,” White said. “That fight’s done, too. I don’t remember what date it’s on for, but yeah it’s done. It’s a done deal. We got that fight done last week.” FloCombat.com reported on Friday that Aldo vs. Holloway will take place at UFC 212 on June 3 in Rio de Janeiro. Aldo was the long-reigning champion of the 145-pound division before losing his belt to Conor McGregor via 13-second knockout at UFC 194. However, McGregor never defended the title and was forced to relinquish the crown after capturing lightweight gold against Eddie Alvarez at UFC 205. Aldo, who defeated Frankie Edgar for the interim title at UFC 200 this past summer, was then elevated to undisputed champion. Holloway, meanwhile, stopped Anthony Pettis via third-round technical knockout at UFC 206 on Dec. 10 to claim the interim 145-pound strap and set up the showdown with Aldo. “Blessed” has won 10 straight fights in the Octagon. “That’s a fun fight,” White said. “Holloway has looked incredible in his last few fights, and Jose Aldo is Jose Aldo.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T04:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:40:18.629+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
