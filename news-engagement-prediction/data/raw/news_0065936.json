By MURAT GÖKMEN, STEVE BLISS and ALEXANDRA EATON on Publish Date February 22, 2017. . Watch in Times Video » embed MILAN — In the latest installment of this series that goes inside the private working worlds of designers, Jeremy Scott, creative director of Moschino and the founder of an eponymous line, discusses his life in Milan and Los Angeles, his love of stuff and why he is happy to stay a fashion outsider. And that’s just what didn’t make it into the video. When did you become a two-brand designer? I started at Moschino Oct. 31 or Nov. 1, 2013, and now I go back and forth between Milan and Los Angeles, where I live. Fundamentally I think about myself like a subway station, and I feel like either the Moschino collection or the Jeremy Scott collection goes on these tracks. Maybe they both stop in the station, but they end up in different destinations. Photo Jeremy Scott, at home for the moment, in Los Angeles. Credit Tarik Hameedi for The New York Times Didn’t you start your brand in Paris? I moved to Paris around 1995 or 1996; my first collection on the runway was in 1997. This September will be my 20th anniversary. I went to Paris to learn and absorb some of the amazing ambience I was enamored with growing up in Kansas City. I didn’t go there to start my own collection. But I never could get an internship, so finally I was left with just doing my own show. I’ve always felt like an outsider, and I’ll probably continue to always feel like an outsider. Hopefully that’s a good thing. I feel like I approach things differently than other designers. Did joining Moschino change that? Having a house like Moschino, with ad campaigns and all these other elements, gives me maybe more legitimacy for a lot of people. But I’m the same. Except that now I have a different megaphone to the world. Photo Mr. Scott studying concepts in his studio. Credit John Fisher for The New York Times What’s your schedule like in Milan? My schedule in Milan is based on fittings and shows. There are times I might be here for a couple of weeks, then I might not be here for another month. I’m always here for a concentrated amount of time, and I go into this bubble and work sometimes till 4 in the morning. They have a restaurant here at the office and create special vegetarian meals for me. I walk to and from the office to the hotel, so I’m basically in this little Moschino world. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Is it different when you are home in Los Angeles? In Los Angeles, I probably go to the movies or to a restaurant more than I would here in Milan, but I don’t go out to clubs and bars and places. I have a very hermetic life. I’m pretty much at the studio, home or at SoulCycle. It’s one of the three places you can find me if you’re looking for me intently enough.
