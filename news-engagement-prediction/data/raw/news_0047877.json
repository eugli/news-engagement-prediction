appealing for information over her death. \n﻿ Nadine Haag's wrist was slashed, and a note was left at the scene of her death, with the words \"he did it\" scrawled behind it. \nSeven years on, the Haag family just want to know what happened to their beloved Nadine. \nThe body of former Dunedin woman Nadine Haag, 33, was found in the shower of her Castle Hill flat in Sydney, Australia, on December 4, 2009. \nPolice concluded the mother-of-one committed suicide, but that conclusion sparked her siblings to embark upon an extraordinary investigation of their own. \nThat investigation led to the Coroner overturning the police ruling and instead declaring an open finding in an August 2013 decision. \nBut that is not the end of the matter for Haag's family. \nNadine Haag's death is a mystery. \nHer sister, Tasia Haag, speaking to Stuff while in New Zealand, said the family was still determined to find out how their beloved sister and daughter died. \n\"We still strongly believe that Nadine died at the hands of another, or the result of foul play. \n\"If someone does know about it, if they do know anything, be it [about] a family member or friend or colleague, [we ask] that they come forward.\" \nTasia Haag said the family had not heard from police since the coronial finding. \n\"We don't know what they are doing, but as a family we want to help them in whatever way possible,\" she said. \nNew South Wales Police have not yet responded to media questions about the case. \n​NADINE'S DEATH AND THE FAMILY'S INVESTIGATION \nNadine Haag's left wrist was slashed and a note in her own handwriting was left at the scene. \nHowever, Tasia, her other sisters Cherie and Chantal and brother Marcel did not accept the police's ruling that her death was a suicide. \nInstead the family started a private investigation that ultimately forced a coronial inquest. \nThat included recreating the crime scene, talking with neighbours and providing details of Nadine's allegedly volatile relationship with her former partner, Nestore Guizzon. \nA dress she may have been wearing on the day of her death has never been found. \nAnd crucially the siblings found a message written behind Nadine's suicide note saying, \"He did it\". \nThe words \"He did it\" were also found etched on a tile in the bathroom by the new residents of Nadine's former apartment. \nGuizzon denied having anything do with her death. \nOn the day of her death Nadine was to attend an appointment with a lawyer about plans to return with her young daughter to her family in Queensland. \nDeputy state coroner Paul MacMahon said in his findings that Guizzon's actions \"raised considerable suspicion\" that her death may have been a homicide. \nWhile there was no evidence placing her former partner near her apartment, he had motive to harm her, the opportunity to do so and \"lied about his whereabouts\", the coroner noted. \nPhone records placed him in the Castle Hill area for most of the day, and into into the evening, despite Nadine's former partner saying he was home all day; some 30 kilometres away from her apartment. \nHowever, there was no evidence that placed Guizzon in Haag's apartment at any relevant time. \n\"On the one hand, at the time of her death there was nothing to suggest that she would act to end her life, whilst on the other hand, on the evidence available there are serious difficulties in characterising her death as a homicide,\" MacMahon noted. \nAfter the ruling the family's solicitor called on NSW police to conduct a full, comprehensive investigation. But the family are still waiting. \nSEVEN YEARS ON \n\"I believe she died at the hands of somebody, I believe she didn't do it,\" Tasia Haag said. \n\"Someone always knows something. \n\"We want people to come out, it's seven years on and people might think it has blown over\". \nBut for the Haag family, \"it never stops\". \n\"There are so many victims from this.\" \nHaag said her family knew Nadine very well and talked to her in the days before her death. \nSince her sister's death Haag continued to study and research crime scenes and was doing a course in forensic criminology. \n\"I want to help people in our situation. The fact there is no-one out there to tell you how to finalise a person's life at the end … it is horrific for a family member. \n\"The simple things in life aren't so simple.\" \nAnyone with information about the case was urged to contact police, or anonymously via Crimestoppers in New Zealand on 0800 555 111 or on 1800 333 000 in Australia. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T08:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T04:06:29.822+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
