The final list has been pruned from 799 players who registered their names for the auction. There are as many as 122 international players, including six players from Associate nations (five from Afghanistan and one from UAE). \n\nThe most sought after players at the auction will be the England players. The likes of Ben Stokes , Eoin Morgan and Chris Woakes have listed their base price at a maximum of INR 2 crore alongside Mitchell Johnson , Pat Cummins and Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews. Ishant Sharma is the only Indian, who has picked a valuation of INR 2 crore. Asghar Stanikzai, Mohammad Nabi, Mohammad Shahzad, Rashid Khan and Dawlat Zadran, all from Afghanistan, alongwith UAE's Chirag Suri being the sixth player. \n\nPawan Negi , who was bought for INR 8.5 crore last year by Delhi Daredevils, has been listed at INR 30 lakhs. This will be the final year of IPL before the teams overhaul their squads for the 2018 season. Considering this, the franchises may not splurge money like they had in the previous auctions. \n\nThe existing player contracts will expire after this season of the league and most players are expected to go under the hammer at a mega auction ahead of the 2018 season. The retention policy and the number of teams for the 2018 season - with Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals set to return after a two-year ban - are among the decisions yet to be taken by the IPL governing body.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T20:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T10:51:35.425+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
