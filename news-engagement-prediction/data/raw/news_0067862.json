Daily Edition James O'Keefe Says He Will Release Tapes \"Exposing CNN\" 6:26 PM PST 2/22/2017 by THR Staff The author and \"guerrilla journalist\" teased a series of recordings with #CNNLeaks. \nAuthor and undercover journalist James O'Keefe has teased the release of recordings \"exposing CNN.\" \nThe president of Project Veritas, an investigative organization, tweeted Wednesday a photo of himself editing video, along with the caption \"Tomorrow. #CNNLeaks.\" The website seen in the background of his photo leads to a Project Veritas site that simply says \"CNNLeaks is coming soonâ€¦\" \n\"We will be releasing a new video exposing CNN soon,\" reads the website. \nCNN reported later in the day that in a phone interview with the journalist, O'Keefe said that he has hundreds of hours of \"secretly recorded material\" from inside CNN that he calling \"CNN Leaks,\" inspired by WikiLeaks. \nCiting President Trump's recent accusations of CNN being \"fake news,\" O'Keefe told the network that it was a target of his because \"my audience, the American people, are deeply upset at the media.\" \"We think our media needs to be held to account, and CNN is kind of the leader of that,\" he told the network. \nO'Keefe told CNN that he would drop the first recordings on Thursday morning, promising that it was \"all legally recorded information.\" \nThe journalist has a history of using questionable tactics to secure recordings or otherwise trap subjects of his investigations. \nIn 2014, the conservative-leaning undercover journalist released a series of videos that aimed to portray Hollywood environmentalists, including Susan Sarandon, as hypocrites. \nO'Keefe's evidence included selectively edited video clips of a prominent industry figure, who was surreptitiously recorded by the journalist's accomplices. The goal was to show that environmental-minded celebrities would take financing for an anti-fracking film, even knowing that the money came from questionable sources. \nFilmmakers who were targets of the sting operation filed a criminal complaint with police and asked the FBI to determine whether federal laws were broken when the journalist surreptitiously recorded phone calls and a lunch meeting.
