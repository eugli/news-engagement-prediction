Behind these books there is a lot of work because we have to search to try to find out where the books are - auction houses, collectors, colleagues - and there’s big research behind these books,” he said. \nReports said the selected books were put in holdalls and pulled up to the roof with ropes before being lowered down to a waiting van where they were driven away. \nThere is speculation the raid was done to order because the titles would be impossible to sell to a reputable dealer or auction house tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T03:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:34:06.687+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
