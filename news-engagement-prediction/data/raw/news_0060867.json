And when the visitor gives the 70-year-old Rs 200 after she says she hasn't eaten properly in days, her eyes well up. She quietly shuffles inside her hut, which is bandaged into standing up with bits of cloth and plastic, puts the money in a tin box and sends a prayer heavenwards. \n\nNo one these days believes Mula Devi is 'Bandit Queen' Phoolan Devi's mother. When Phoolan lived and ruled in Chambal in the early 1980, people around these parts would greet Mula Devi whenever she ventured out. There would be a stream of visitors. There was food and clothes. She is left only with rags and memories now. \n\nLast year while doing a survey on the impact of a severe drought in the region, an NGO found Mula Devi and her daughter Ramkali, Phoolan's younger sister, on the brink of death by starvation. Kuldeep Baudh, convenor of Bundelkhand Dalit Adhikar Manch, told TOI, \"When we visited them, they were in possession of 250 gm of onion and a little flour. They were about to collapse. It is unbelievable that someone from this family was a Member of Parliament 17 years ago.\" \n\nMula Devi's 3 bigha-land on the outskirts of Sheikhpur Gudha village that gave rise to the phenomenon called Phoolan, who after becoming a victim of caste-based oppression chose to pick up the gun, shooting dead 22 upper caste Thakurs involved in her gang rape in nearby Behmai in 1981, is gone. Ramkali, who bears a stark resemblance to the dreaded dacoit of yore, brings home Rs 300-400 a month doing MNREGA work -- if she is lucky. There isn't much beyond that. \n\n\"It's only during elections that politicians come to meet us,\" Ramkali said. \"They exhibit me on stage. I get Rs 200 for it. But in the last couple of years, I have refused most of them. That's because I started getting veiled threats from other candidates. I thought it's better not to associate myself with any political party for a few hundred rupees.\" \n\nRamkali, Phoolan Devi's sister. \n\n\n\n\nPhoolan surrendered in 1983 and was charged with 48 cases of crime, including multiple murders, all of which were withdrawn by the Mulayam Singh government later. She was released from jail in 1994 and got elected two years later as an MP from Mirzapur on a Samajwadi Party . She again went to the Lok Sabha in 1999 but couldn't complete her term as she was gunned down outside her official residence in Delhi on July 25 2001, allegedly by the kin of those she had massacred in 1981. \n\nBut those days of power and glory are today a faint blur in the minds of Mula Devi and Ramkali, a daily wage labour who lives in a hut with no toilet. \"After Phoolan's murder, our land was snatched away. She had agricultural land, houses in Ghaziabad and a petrol pump as well. Mulayam Singh had promised a party ticket for my younger daughter but all was forgotten after news about her stopped coming out in the papers with time.\" \n\nPhoolan's village comes under Kalpi assembly constituency of Jalaun district in Bundelkhand. In all, 10 candidates are in the fray this time, out of which Uma Kanti, the sitting MLA from Congress, is re-contesting. Chote Singh, who won the seat on a BSP ticket in 2007, is also in the fight. Asked if local leaders had tried to help Phoolan's family, Singh said, \"I have helped them from time to time. I also help them in paperwork for the ongoing land dispute case. I would have arranged for a job for the family, but nobody seems competent enough.\" \n\nA group of people on a campaign procession cross Mula Devi's house. But there isn't much excitement in Sheikhpur Gudha. \"Look at the poverty all around,\" Mula Devi gestured. \"We are all so deprived. There is no water, there are no roads or hospitals.\" She said she will vote for whoever promises to give her some food when she is hungry and there is no money in her little tin box.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T10:02:34.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
