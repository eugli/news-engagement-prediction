By Lisa Wright BBC News 12 February 2017 Close share panel Image caption Celebrities including Kelly Brook and Fearne Cotton have donated underwear for charity auctions Celebrity underwear has long attracted interest - and big bucks - with garments once owned or worn by the likes of Ed Sheeran, Kelly Brook and Dame Helen Mirren a big attraction at auctions. \nBuyers have also snapped up smalls once sported by Queen Victoria and Madonna - and even Hitler's companion Eva Braun. \nSo just what is the appeal of the undergarments of the rich and famous? \nCity University of London's Prof Chris Rojek, a sociologist who is an expert in the study of celebrity , says it comes down to people wanting find a way to get closer to someone they will never meet. \n\"The audience, or some sections of them, want a relationship of perceived intimacy with the celebrity,\" he said. \n\"They are never going to meet them or see their underwear, but if they own them (their undergarments), they feel closer than they would otherwise.\" Image copyright Kerry Taylor Auctions Image caption Queen Victoria's split-drawers sold for £550 in June 2015 Image copyright Kerry Taylor Auctions Image caption Two pairs of Queen Victoria's black silk stockings sold for £600 in 2015 Image copyright Kerry Taylor Auctions Image caption A Jean Paul Gaultier gold lamé stage ensemble designed for Madonna's Blond Ambition tour, 1990.

I have a net bra from Blaze Star and a net bra and panties set from Lynne O'Neill. \n\"These women set the standard and made it possible for women like me to do this job today, and to have a piece of that history is so important to me.\" Image copyright Empics Image caption Neil Kendall with burlesque performer Tempest Storm and a jewelled underwear set once worn by her \nVintage photographer Neil Kendall has been collecting burlesque items for about 20 years. \nHis private collection has around 60 items, which he displays in a pop-up museum, and includes stage-worn costumes and undergarments dating from the early 1920s. \nMr Kendall said many of the items were donated by performers. One of his most treasured pieces is an original jewelled underwear set once worn by legendary burlesque performer Tempest Storm, which cost $500 (£400). \n\"It is part of this incredible legacy to people that have made a career of parading their body on stage,\" added Mr Kendall, who lives in Chester. \n\"For me, it is a passion born from burlesque and the artistry and theatricality - from the stagecraft to the costume and underwear that they wore.\" Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T02:57:24.182+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
