Not because I thought she was overreacting, and not because I couldn't believe how poorly made the product was, but because I understood exactly what she was saying, because I also have that couchâ€”well, the loveseat versionâ€”and I, too, can confirm that it's a huge disappointment. Advertisement \nHezel's personal essay has been making major waves since it was published last week. After more and more unhappy customers came forward to echo her complaints about the piece of furniture falling apart, beginning with the buttons, West Elm decided to pull the sofas from its website and store floors and, according to BuzzFeed News , is now offering full refunds on the defective Peggy sofas purchased in the U.S. and Canada after July 2014. \n\"We were sorry to learn of our customers' experience with the Peggy Collection and have decided to temporarily remove it from our U.S. and Canada assortmentâ€”online and in storesâ€”until we can better understand and resolve any issues,\" BuzzFeed reports the company said in a statement. \"We stand behind the integrity of our products and take customer feedback seriously.\" \nMuch like Hezel, my own route to Peggy ownership began as a somewhat romantic quest. My boyfriend and I had just moved to New York City from the Midwest. We didn't have room in our U-Haul for our old couch, and we decided it was finally time to invest in a piece of furniture we could be proud of. Our new sofa would be a symbol of our success in our careers (we had both accepted new jobs in Manhattan) and our relationship (we'd been together for four years and had lived together for one). \nWe shopped around quite a bit before deciding on Peggy, struggling with the incredibly frustrating fact that most sofas are either comfy or stylish. \"Why must the two be mutually exclusive?\" I thought. At the time (we have since moved), we were also living in a teeny-tiny studio apartment, and in order to fit, the couch needed to be about five feet wide. Those specific needs led us to one good option: West Elm's Peggy Loveseat. Taysha Murtaugh \nThe beautiful mid-century shape was exactly what we were looking for, and it felt comfortable enough in the store. The employees assured us that the piece would last a long time. Though $1,000 was a lot of money for us, we convinced ourselves it was an investment and we'd have it forever. Taysha Murtaugh \nA couple months in, the first button popped off for no reason. We figured it was a fluke and flipped the cushion over, but they continued to come loose just from regular sitting. Though annoyed and disappointed, we didn't think there was anything that could be done. We had declined the warranty because we couldn't justify spending yet another hundred bucks on one piece of furniture. Two years later, we have lost a total of seven of the 24 buttons on the fronts and backs of the seat cushions. Our once beautiful couch is now a mess, and it's also incredibly uncomfortable (seriously, we've gotten into arguments over the thing), so there really is no saving grace. As my boyfriend puts it, \"People don't buy West Elm couches because they're comfortable. They buy them because they're stylish, so when they don't look good anymore, people are going to be mad.\" Some personal news. The Peggy sofa has completely disappeared from https://t.co/QdaNx0ADfI . ðŸ‘€ â€” Anna Hezel (@HezelAnna) February 20, 2017 \nUnlike Hezel, we didn't complain to customer service. We also didn't troll West Elm's social media channels, as she mentions other unsatisfied customers didâ€”partly because we are \" Iowa nice \" and assumed it was an isolated issue and, frankly, our own fault for not purchasing the warranty, and partly because who has the time for that? @westelm , this isn't a defect? 3 months & buttons falling off of our peggy sofa- your cstmr service says no. really?! pic.twitter.com/TbzDoAio9v â€” Laura K Leung (@laurakleung) May 8, 2015 \nAnyway, even if we had complained, it wouldn't have gotten us anywhere, as many fellow Peggy owners can attestâ€”that is, until now. Hezel's essay seems to have struck a chord with the company. \nDo you have issues with your Peggy sofa? Contact West Elm's special support number (888) 922-7870 or email support@westelm.com.
