King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 10 minutes ago 3 \nAccording to a new report from journalist Paul Cashmere of Noise11, AC/DC are gearing up to hit the studio with Axl Rose. \nThe report reads : \"With Guns N' Roses dates running through until September, it is expected that the next AC/DC album with Axl Rose won't be ready until 2018. \n\"The chemistry between Axl Rose and Angus Young has inspired Angus to start planning another AC/DC record but Guns N' Roses touring commitments throughout 2017 will make it difficult to finalize the project. As all of the AC/DC shows were filmed it is possible fans may be treated to a live album with Rose from the ' Rock or Bust ' tour prior to the new studio album. \n\"Despite the departure of Johnson and the retirement (at age 66) of bass player Cliff Williams after 40 years with the band, Angus has vowed that AC/DC will continue.\"Stay tuned for updates.
