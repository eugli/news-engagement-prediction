Article continues below \nWhile he has etched his name in the club's history books, it seems as though boss Jose Mourinho does not see him as an automatic starter anymore, and that is something that Rooney cannot accept. \nWith only two goals in 17 league appearances this term, the man who is also England's record goalscorer doesn't have much of an argument for a place, especially when you consider Zlatan Ibrahimovic's exploits this season, the rise of Marcus Rashford, and the quality of Anthony Martial. Article continues below What caused an angry reaction from Antoine Greizmann's vs Bayer Leverkusen \nA source told Sportsmail on Tuesday night: ‘The writing is on the wall for Wayne. He can see what’s happening. He’s playing less and believes he still has a lot to give. He won’t want to continue here like this.’ \nMourinho refused to offer any guarantees that Rooney will stay on Tuesday night, saying: ‘Of course I can’t guarantee. I cannot guarantee that I’m here next week, how can I guarantee that a player is here next season?\" \nIt hasn't taken much for the Twitter world to read between the lines. \nMost United fans are sad at the idea of Rooney departing Old Trafford, while others have suggested he is only interested in money. \nIt's hard to imagine Rooney going to another Premier League now after 13 years with the Red Devils. \nBearing in mind his spell at the club has coincided with five Premier League titles and one Champions League triumph among other successes, Rooney is not some mercenary passing through. He has been a pillar of the club. \nWith the Chinese transfer window slamming shut next week, we won't have to wait long to see how the drama unfolds. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
