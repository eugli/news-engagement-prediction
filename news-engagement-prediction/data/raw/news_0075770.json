What's The Point of Marriage, Gay or Straight? \nIs there even a point to gays getting married? Why would they want to bother? Aside from property and legal issues that might be solved by other laws, what point are gay couples trying to make in getting married? Why is it important for them to be able to hold up a marriage certificate and say 'we're married' instead of just saying 'we're a couple' without a certificate? It's not unusual for opponents gay marriage to ask this, and it's a reasonable question - but it's a reasonable question for anyone, not just gay couples. What's The Point of Marriage, Gay or Straight? \nWhat is a Marriage Between a Man and a Woman? \nOpponents of gay marriage and marriage equality usually insist that marriage is only legitimate when it's between a man and a woman But where does that leave people who are not quite either male or female - at least according to the definitions usually employed? Defining marriage in terms of sex begs the question of how we define a person's sex in the first place. What is a \"man\" and what is a \"woman\"? Using strict terminology, there are people for whom marriage to anyone might be permanently denied. What is a Marriage Between a Man and a Woman? \nMarriage: Religious Rite or Civil Right? \nAlmost every opponent to gay marriage tends to rely on the belief that marriage is essentially and necessarily a religious rite. For them, marriage is conceived of almost exclusively in religious terms, which means that gay marriage amounts to a form a sacrilege, not to mention an intrusion of the state into a religious matter . It's true that religion has traditionally played a role in sanctifying marriages, but in the end this belief is simply incorrect. Marriage: Religious Rite or Civil Right? \nMarriage is Sacred and a Sacrament \nClosely connected with the idea that marriage is necessarily religious is the belief that marriage is sacred or even a type of sacrament, although this argument is rarely made explicitly. Nevertheless, it is perhaps one of the most important and fundamental arguments for opponents of gay marriage because it seems to lie at the heart of almost all of their other arguments as well as motivate much of their vehemence in a way that would be hard to explain otherwise Indeed, if it weren't for the idea that marriage is sacred, it seems unlikely that ongoing debate would be as rancorous as it is. Marriage is Sacred and a Sacrament \nMarriage is for Raising Children \nThe idea that gay couples shouldn't be allowed to marry because they can't procreate is extremely popular, but it's also probably the weakest and least credible argument. If marriage only exists for the purpose of having children, then how can infertile couples be allowed to marry? The simple fact is that this argument depends on using a standard that is not applied to straight couples. Marriage is for Raising Children \nGay Marriage Will Undermine the Institution of Marriage \nThe argument that something new or some change would undermine or destroy a valued institution is almost inevitable, so it's no surprise that opponents of gay marriage frequently complain that such marriages would undermine the institution of marriage . A marriage between members of the same sex is a self-contradiction, according to opponents, so their unions will somehow harm marriage itself. Just how much damage could gay unions do, though? And how? Gay Marriage Will Undermine the Institution of Marriage \nGay Couples are Unnatural & Unnatural Unions Cannot Be Marriage \nThis objection to gay marriage doesn't even try to pretend to be objective and fair, focusing instead directly on people's animus towards gays and lesbians. Homosexual relationships are treated explicitly as abnormal and unnatural, thus easily leading to the conclusion that said relationships should not be given any sort of legal or social status. Perhaps the only good thing that can be said about this argument is that it's the most directly honest one that opponents are likely to make. Gay Couples are Unnatural & Unnatural Unions Cannot Be Marriage \nGay Marriage is Incompatible with Religious Liberty \nOpposition to equal civil rights for gays comes in many forms, and when all of the arguments about gay marriage being intrinsically bad fail, religious conservatives move to argue that such marriages will somehow infringe on their own civil rights. It's an appealing tactic, since no one wants to be tarred as an opponent of religious liberty, but thus far conservatives have failed to explain how or why treating gays like fully equal citizens and human beings is incompatible with anyone's religious liberty. Since when did the preservation of religious rights require treating minorities like second-class citizens? Gay Marriage is Incompatible with Religious Liberty \nGay Marriage Can't Be a Real Marriage \nThe most simplistic argument against gay marriage is to look at a dictionary, marvel at the discovery that it only mentions men and women marrying, then sagely concluding that gays can't possibly marry. This incredibly simple-minded approach ignores - perhaps deliberately - the fact that the nature of marriage has changed in definition and make-up quite often over the centuries. Marriage today isn't at all like what it was two millennia or even two centuries ago. Given how broad and fundamental the changes in the nature of marriage have been, what exactly are traditionalists trying to defend, and why? What it truly \"traditional\" about modern marriage? Gay Marriage Can't Be a Real Marriage \nMarriage as a Cultural Symbol \nThe debate over the legalization of gay marriage in America is about more than just the status of gay couples; it's also about the future of American civil law. Either civil law is defined by the needs and rights of citizens and gay marriage will be legalized, or civil laws will be placed under the dominion of religious laws and gay marriage will remain banned. Opponents of gay marriage try to offer legal and social reasons for their position, but it always comes back to religion and religion-based animosity towards gays for them. For Christian Nationalists, legalized gay marriage would represent a defeat for their religion in the fight to define the boundaries of American culture and law. \nGay marriage furthermore represents a threat to established norms of authority, identity and power. Those who possess that authority and power and who have used them to create their identities are thereby threatened by the prospective changes. One thing that has often puzzled me and others is the argument from so many religious and political conservatives that same-sex marriages \"threaten\" and \"undermine\" traditional heterosexual marriages. The same is said even about domestic partnership laws which would give same-sex partners a few of the same basic rights as married couples. Why is this? How can one relationship threaten or undermine someone else's? \nMarriage is not just an institution, but also a symbol representing our culture's ideals about sex, sexuality, and human relationships. Symbols are important - they are a common cultural currency which we each use to help create our sense of self. Thus when the traditional nature of marriage is challenged in any way, so are people's basic identities. By asking legislatures to pass \"Defense of Marriage\" acts, voters are using the law to create the cultural equivalent of a copyright or trademark on the institution of marriage to prevent it from be challenged too much.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T18:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:28:48.115+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
