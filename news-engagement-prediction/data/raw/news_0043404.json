He then claimed that Dh400,000 cash had been stolen from the car.\nCol. Ibrahim Al Ajill, Director of Criminal Investigations Department at Sharjah Police, said: “When the suspect filed his complaint, police officers suspected that he was not being honest about the robbery. But the suspect kept sticking to his story, and claimed that money was stolen from his parked car.”\nDuring the investigation, police then arrested the four Pakistani men who sold the gold bars to the victim.\nPolice also discovered that the victim intended to make a profit by selling the stolen for Dh1 million.\nSharjah Police has transferred all five suspects to public prosecution – including the man who reported the fake robbery complaint ­– on charges of theft and buying stolen goods, as well as providing false testimonies to police.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:41:06.439+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
