'His condition was so worrying that it could have been fatal, so we had a serious think as a family and we decided to move away.' Finley was given a swine flu jab in 2009 - but his family believe this is what caused him to develop the unusual allergy. His parents, Rebecca, 36, and Martin, 39, made the drastic decision to move half way across the world so Finley could enjoy life free from his allergy to the cold weather The evening after he had the vaccine, he had started to become physically sick and suffered from hallucinations. Then his cold allergy began. After eating an ice lolly, his face swelled so badly that he looked like he had 'fish lips', according to Mrs Mitchell. 'It's not certain that the jab brought on his condition, but as his mother, I'm positive that it was,' she added. The family then took Finley to see a doctor who jokingly suggested moving abroad. They initially thought he was suffering from an extreme case of goose bumps, but Mrs Mitchell was determined to prove this wasn't the problem. She began to take him to various doctors as his condition became so bad that he was unable to sit on a cold pavement without getting hives on his bottom. Eventually an allergy specialist assisted him and put an ice cube under his arm to test his reaction. They immediately noticed that a bump was starting to grow - allowing them to make the correct diagnosis. But a few years later, they were preparing their visas before they finally made the jump to Australia. Mrs Mitchell added: 'I knew then that moving away was the best thing for us, we were told that if Finley was still suffering by the time he turned 7, it was likely he would have hives forever.' Upon moving to Australia, Finley has come on in leaps and bounds and his condition has improved. WHAT IS COLD URTICARIA? Cold urticaria is a skin reaction to cold that causes red, itchy hives - but the severity varies widely. Swimming in cold water is the most common cause of a whole-body reaction. But temperatures lower than 4°C (39°F) and wind can also trigger reactions in sufferers. It can lead to very low blood pressure, fainting, shock and even death. Cold urticaria occurs most frequently in young adults - but it tends to clear up within a few years. Experts are unsure how it is caused, but many assume it is due to them having sensitive skin cells from an inherited trait. Treatment usually includes taking antihistamines and avoiding cold air and water. Source: Mayo Clinic When the family first moved, he was kept away from any cold objects and liquids to prevent an outbreak. But his body has become so much better, with only the cold water causing him to develop an outbreak. He has joined a local soccer club and is settling in well, according to his family. And he hasn’t needed his inhaler or antihistamine medicine to ease the allergy. Mrs Mitchell said: 'In England he would miss play time, and wouldn’t be able to socialise with friends. 'He was on constant medication in the UK, whereas now we’re in Australia he is drug free, it’s amazing.' But many people in Australia are often bemused by his condition. She added: 'My Australian friends don’t believe me when I tell them about his condition. 'It’s such a rarity here due to the heat. I’m hoping that after time his body will get to a point that it fights off the condition completely. 'Though there’s no guarantee that will happen because even doctors don’t know much about it. 'I’d like to try and do all I can to raise awareness for hives, being allergic to the cold is a real condition which can cause serious harm.'
