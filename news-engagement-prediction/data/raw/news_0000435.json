I’m shocked... I’ve never seen a political leader doing this.” \nEven the workers were surprised when they saw Zambry at the MBI Waste Management Centre in Buntong. Zambry greeted the workers by saying he was going to join them and wanted to get a feel of their everyday work. \nHe hopped on the rubbish truck and went around some areas in Buntong to collect rubbish and also went to the market to examine the cleanliness of the market. \nLater in the morning, Zambry stopped at the Ipoh Wet Market to collect more rubbish and some of the people there took the opportunity to take pictures with the state leader. \nThe mentri besar said the effort is all part of a drive to encourage council workers and also the public to keep Ipoh clean and to work towards being Ipoh “the cleanest city in the country” once again. \nZambry (third from right), seen here with with Ipoh City Council general workers, said cleanliness is event more important now with Visit Perak Year. \nZambry said he woke up early in the morning and called journalists to join him at 6.30am although he did not tell them what he would be doing. Ipoh Mayor Datuk Zamri Man also took part in the exercise. \nAfter helping out the workers, Zambry told reporters that he wanted to be there himself instead of instructing MBI personnel to conduct cleaning work in some areas. \n“After my dawn prayers,I spoke with the mayor and told him that I want to go out with the MBI workers. \n“And I told him specifically that I want to work with those who ensure the cleanliness of the city. \n“I wanted to see their efforts and I hope my presence cheered them up,” he said to reporters, adding that if he had alerted the media or the City Council earlier, they would have made preparations by cleaning up the city thoroughly and it would not have been a surprise too. \n“As a leader, I wanted to be working with them and do my part in making sure the city is clean. \n“I can’t just make decisions from my office. I must go down the ground and make my presence felt. We are in this together.” \nZambry (left) said he decided to join council workers on their rounds so he could gain a better feel of what their work requires. \nHe said he believes that MBI will continue its stellar job in keeping the city clean and as mentri besar, he is satisfied with the city’s current cleanliness, though they should not rest on their laurels. \n“It’s a continuous effort. Cleaning and collecting rubbish is not only MBI’s job, the people have to do their part too. \n“Many famous cities around the world are clean because people are doing their part to keep the city clean. I want Ipoh to be at that level too.” \nWhen asked about illegal dumping, Zambry said he is worried about industrial waste and remnants from construction sites that being disposed of in illegal dumping areas. \nHe is aware that there are many cases of this around the city and has instructed the MBI to take action against errant business owners and contractors. \n“There are lots of cases and I’m very aware that MBI is looking at all of them. To people who throw rubbish in illegal dumping areas, please stop doing it because it’s not only going to affect your household.” \nHe said clealiness will always be an important matter in Perak and with many tourists coming to Perak for Visit Perak Year, he said it is time for everyone to join hands and make sure tourist have pleasant experiences of the state. \n“Cleanliness is very important and we want these tourists to give good reviews. Lonely Planet has rated us highly and we have to make sure that we live up to that reputation. \n“I would like to congratulate all the MBI general workers for their contribution but we should also help them.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T03:25:41.146+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
