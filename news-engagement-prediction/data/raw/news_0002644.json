The two companies had hosted the party together since the beginning of the Obama administration.\nIt is one of Washington’s high-profile affairs and follows the annual event when the president tells jokes before a crowd of journalists and celebrities.\nThere had been some doubt that the main event would be held at all, given the Trump administration’s battles with the White House press corps since taking office. Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon, referred to the media in a recent New York Times article as an “opposition party,” that ought to “keep its mouth shut.”\nBut on Thursday, the White House Correspondents’ Association confirmed its annual black-tie gala is on for April 29 at the Washington Hilton.\nThe New Yorker, which like Vanity Fair is published by Conde Nast, has also decided not to host its annual correspondent’s dinner pre-party, a spokeswoman for the magazine said. The New York Times earlier reported on the New Yorker’s decision .\nLate-night show host Samantha Bee has already announced plans for a counter-party, a “Not the White House Correspondents’ Dinner” event with proceeds to go to the Committee to Protect Journalists.\nThe long-running feud between Messrs. Trump and Carter dates back to the 1980s, when Mr. Carter helped immortalize the real estate tycoon – by then already well-known on the New York scene – as a “short-fingered vulgarian” in the pages of the now-defunct Spy magazine.\nWhen Mr. Trump several times on the campaign trail made pointed reference to the size of his hands, some saw echoes of the fight with Mr. Carter.\nThe enmity hasn’t cooled now that Mr. Trump has taken office, with him recently dismissing Mr. Carter as a “no talent” hack in response to a scathing Vanity Fair review of a Trump Tower restaurant.\nStill, Mr. Trump has appeared in the pages and on the cover of Vanity Fair in the past, and he and wife Melania have attended the magazine’s annual Oscar party several times.\nThe magazine was a harsh critic of the president during the election, with Mr. Carter writing several searing pieces on Mr. Trump in which he accused him of trafficking in bigotry and declaring that he would “leave a permanent orange stain” on American politics even if he had lost.\nMr. Trump hasn’t pulled his punches with the magazine chieftain over the years, referring to him as “Dopey Graydon Carter” on Twitter and claiming his restaurant, the Waverly Inn, has “the worst food” in New York.\n—Joe Flint contributed to this article.\nWrite to Lukas I.
