Dowell / Orlando Sentinel \nSeminole goalkeeper Noah Smith made 7 saves in Seminoles' 3-2 win over West Orange on Saturday. \nSeminole goalkeeper Noah Smith made 7 saves in Seminoles' 3-2 win over West Orange on Saturday. (Stephen M. Dowell / Orlando Sentinel) Lynn Ramsey Correspondent \nNicholas Brahmbhatt headed in a free kick with four minutes and 58 seconds remaining in the match to help visiting Seminole defeat West Orange 3-2 in a Class 5A, Region 1 boys soccer semifinal on Saturday night. \nSeminole (23-2-3), ranked No. 1 in the Sentinel Super Six, will play host to DeLand, which defeated Port Orange Spruce Creek 2-1 in overtime, in Tuesday’s region final. It marks the first region final in program history, surpassing a semifinal exit in 2012. \nIt’s a matchup involving two coaches who used to be on the same staff at Deltona High. Current DeLand coach Chris Dowdell was Deltona’s head coach in 2004-05, while Seminole coach Brian Emrick was his assistant. A final four berth will be at stake. \n“I have mixed emotions,” Emrick said. “I’m thrilled that one of us can go to the state semifinals.” \nBrahmbhatt gave the Seminoles the winner by heading in a free kick from John Matos into the middle of the goal with 4:58 left in the match. \n“On corners it was a challenge,” said Brahmbhatt of West Orange’s defense. “They constantly had me marked. That last goal, I finally broke through and scored.” \nMomentum in the match went mostly with the team that had a stiff northeast wind at its back. The Seminoles converted 53 seconds into the match. Samuel Lugo sailed a free kick into the six-yard box, but Pedro Melo’s header attempt to clear went into West Orange’s goal. \nAshton Neff scored his team-high 22nd goal with 3:08 to go in the half to put the Seminoles up 2-0. He stole a pass near midfield, dribbled down the left sideline, then beat West Orange keeper Elias Tazi lower right from 15 yards. \n“The two defenders went up for the ball,” Neff said. “I took it from them. I looked up and saw open space and just ran. The keeper came out, and I slotted it in the far post.” \nNo. 3 West Orange (11-3-5) rallied in the second half with the wind at its back. Matthew Trautmann brought the Warriors to within 2-1 with 34:57 left in the game. He took a pass from Marco Riberio, then beat the keeper in the top right corner. \nRiberio tied it with 20:50 left in the half. He snuck a shot from 18 yards into the lower post to tie the score 2-2. \nBut Seminole goalkeeper Noah Smith made seven saves, including several diving shots to erase great scoring chances. \n“It was a challenge. They were a really tough team,\" Smith said. \"The goals were pretty amazing, but we tried to defend as hard as we could, make the saves and play as we needed to.” \nEmrick is looking to tighten up the Seminoles’ end-of-game play moving forward. \n“We did not close out the game the way we should,” Emrick said. “But a good, hard-fought win.” \nThe Warriors, who missed several chances, lost momentum when Parker Holland left with a blue card, forcing West Orange to play down one man. \n“I thought both (Seminole early) goals were a little unlucky on our part,” West Orange coach Scott Fisher. “If we keep on doing what we were doing in the first half and keep having opportunities, we would even it up pretty quick, and it happened.” \nHolland is one of eight West Orange seniors who played their last match. Several stars return, however. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T04:54:49.829+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
