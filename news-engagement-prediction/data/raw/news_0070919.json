And so it was nice to see that picture of Hillary Clinton , seemingly fine, hanging out in the woods in upstate New York—to see that after all of the indignity of the campaign, and after stunningly losing the election to an incompetent racist oaf, she was still able to get dressed. It was more than many of the rest of us could say for ourselves. \nAnd while there has been a lot to do since then—including protesting and planning for for the 2018 midterms—the fantasy of Hillary Clinton, Emotionally Stable Lady Of The Forest has remained, becoming something of a pastime throughout the year. In mid-December, The Washington Post published a trend piece on spelunking Hillaryspotters. It contained quotes like this: \n“Bill was in front,” Ellen said. “And then here came Hillary with her poodle and then the agents. And I’m here, and then we were together, and I just said, ‘What happened?’ And she said, ‘I don’t know. I have no idea.’ And I said, ‘I really admire you. You look great. You’re wonderful.’ I stood there with my arms wide open and I’m not even a hugger and I gave her this big hug. She had on a beautiful sweater. She asked my dog’s name.” \nYes, Hillary Clinton is out there in the woods waiting for you. She does not have the answers, but she does have a hug for you and a nice sweater. Is that enough? \nNo, that is not enough, because she’s also a wizard . Author Tim Federle has been tweeting a lengthy fantasy fiction about the former senator, a feverish stew of Harry Potter and establishment Democrat politics that will either be food for your soul or make you vomit up your breakfast. The journey into the woods began on Valentine’s Day: An owl delivers a scroll to Hillary in a forest. “Flynn out,” the scroll says. Hillary tosses it onto her bonfire, and fist-bumps a wolf. — Tim Federle (@TimFederle) February 14, 2017 “The work continues,” she whispers, whittling a wooden Valentine’s heart for Bill. The owl lurks, for it will deliver the heart at dusk. — Tim Federle (@TimFederle) February 14, 2017 Nightfall. A bear approaches, growls. Hillary rolls her eyes, laughs, sends it running away changed. She finds wild mint and makes tea. — Tim Federle (@TimFederle) February 14, 2017 Morning, though she’s been up for hours, mending the wing of a moth. The sky is gray. It churns. “Storm weather,” she says to a sparrow. — Tim Federle (@TimFederle) February 15, 2017 It’s almost time for her daily 45-mile hike. The ground rumbles. Bill flies by in a chartered plane, skywriting: YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT RUSSIA — Tim Federle (@TimFederle) February 15, 2017 She jokingly shakes a fist at the sky; of course she was right about Russia. A bald eagle flies by. She catches it, and names him America. — Tim Federle (@TimFederle) February 15, 2017 2 hikers stumble upon her.“A-a-aren’t you—” one says.“I was,” Hillary says. — Tim Federle (@TimFederle) February 15, 2017 The eagle screeches, caws, flaps its wings. “I am hungry too, America,” she says. “But we must wait.” The eagle calms. They share an acorn. — Tim Federle (@TimFederle) February 15, 2017 She leaves “Sunset Blvd.,” gets into an SUV, is driven to the woods again. As she enters the forest, her gown turns into a thousand leaves. — Tim Federle (@TimFederle) February 16, 2017 \nFederle has continued the narrative over the past week, updating it as the news comes in: Sundown. A hundred fireflies swarm overhead, to spell out ✨MILO BOOK CANCELED✨She uncorks a 1978 Riesling that’s chilling in a brook. — Tim Federle (@TimFederle) February 21, 2017 \nIf interested in more Hillary Clinton fan fiction, there is perhaps unsurprising quantity of it stored in the fan fiction database of Archive Of Our Own , much of which gets downright erotic in places. Still, none of these fantastical post-election ideas is as crazy as the speculative fiction in which she runs for mayor of New York City in an express attempt to troll President Trump.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:09:34.616+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
