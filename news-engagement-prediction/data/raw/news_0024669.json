Long live... Three? \nAfter what MediaWorks chief content officer Andrew Szusterman describes as \"a difficult period of time\" for the broadcaster, TV3 is getting a rebrand. \nFrom midnight tonight the channel will be known simply as 'Three' - although the new logo is more stylised than just that printed word alone can accurately convey. TOM HOLLOW \nDai Henwood and Samantha Hayes helpfully demonstrate two out of the five symbols in TV3's - now known as Three - new logo. \nThe rebranding has been kept very hush-hush up until now - although it has been supported by a cryptic online marketing campaign featuring a host of TV3 stars and various mathematical signs. \nREAD MORE: SUPPLIED \nThe TV3 logo - out with the old and in with the new. \nBright. Playful. Fun. Vibrant. Those four words come up again and again in conversation with Szusterman and his colleague Andy Brown, MediaWorks' chief marketing and data officer, about just what the new logo means for New Zealand's third free-to-air TV channel. \n\"What we've done with the brand now, with being bright, playful and vibrant as key factors, is that we've now got a beautiful home for Three,\" says Szusterman, a 15-year MediaWorks veteran. \n\"There's no change to our content - in the sense that we're not making massive shifts to what we're doing as far as content goes - but we've now got something where our talent get to live in an environment that they deserve to live in - and the audience deserves to see them in.\" \nOK. But wait, there's more. Ad Feedback \n\"We've looked at this for a period of time and we have come to the conclusion that the brand that we currently have has been around since 2003. And 2003 was the year that Saddam Hussein was found in a hidey hole, everyone was using the Nokia 310 as a mobile phone, and Lorde was seven years old - the world has moved on right?\" declares Szusterman. \n\"It's a fragmented media world that we live in - in 2003 there was no Netflix, there was no Lightbox, there was no Neon - so we live in this environment with a brand which we don't think has been fit for purpose. And it actually hasn't fairly represented our content to the best of its abilities. We've got great local content and we haven't showcased it in the way that it deserves to be showcased.\" \n\"There's some nights I've watched 7 Days and thought, actually, that brand is bigger than Three - seems like it's been bigger than Three for a period of time.\" \nSzusterman acknowledged that the past couple of years have seen MediaWorks - and TV3 in particular - weather various storms, but added that the time was now right for the channel to \"evolve\". \n\"It has been a difficult period of time for MediaWorks - but it's also been a difficult time for media in general. Ours have been quite public, but we're not the only ones, and I think that we're now at this place of relative calm, where everything's kind of lining up for us to launch this brand.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T11:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T06:18:16.370+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
