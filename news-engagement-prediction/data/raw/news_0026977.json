Here are the latest rumors. \nApple looks like it's going to go big for the new iPhone, with strong rumors that 2017's model will undergo big changes as it's the handset's tenth anniversary. \nThat could very well start with the name, which is likely to be the iPhone 8, rather than the iPhone 7S, marking the phone out as a big jump rather than a minor refresh. \nBased on early rumors it seems the design, specs and features are all set to receive a major overhaul, and we've sifted through all the whispers on the internet to bring you the definitive guide to what's coming on the new iPhone 8. Read our in-depth reviews: iPhone 7 | iPhone 7 Plus What is it? The 10th anniversary version of Apple's iPhone When is it out? Almost certainly September 2017 What will it cost? More than $649 (£599, AU$1,079) iPhone 8 release date Likely to launch early September 2017 On-sale mid-September 2017 \nBased on previous years, this one is easy to predict: the iPhone 8 release date is September 2017, assuming the 7S doesn't pop up. \nIn fact, with the exception of the iPhone SE , every Apple handset since the iPhone 5 in 2012 has been launched in September, and there's no reason to think that will change for the iPhone 8. \nWe can even get more specific than that, as Apple held its iPhone 7 event on September 7, while the events for the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6 were both on September 9 of their respective launch years. \nEven going further back you'll see similar dates, so again it's likely that Apple will stick to this sort of schedule for the iPhone 8. \nOf course that's not when you'll be able to buy the iPhone 8/iPhone 7S, but Apple typically makes its phones available one to two weeks after announcing them, so you should be able to have the iPhone 8 in your hands before the end of September 2017. \nTechRadar's take: A launch event in the first or second week of September 2017, with the phones hitting stores one to two weeks later. iPhone 8 screen A 5.8-inch screen No home button and no bezels \nApple hasn't done much with its iPhone screens since upping the sizes with the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus , but the iPhone 8 could see the display undergo its biggest change yet, with respected analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claiming that the iPhone 8 will have a curved AMOLED display. \nThis has also more recently been rumored by sources claiming that a curved AMOLED display is one of more than ten prototypes that Apple is considering - and that the phone could even have a higher-than-QHD resolution. \nAMOLED is a technology primarily used by Samsung phones, like the Samsung Galaxy S7 , delivering great contrast and vibrant colors. \nThe AMOLED theory is gaining ground , with reports that Sharp is in negotiations to manufacture an OLED screen for the iPhone, and even a direct claim from Sharp's president that the iPhone 8 will use OLED. \nWe've also heard that Apple has ordered a large number of curved plastic OLED panels from Samsung. The Korean company is said to have struck a deal to provide Apple with 100 million OLED screens. \nBut, because of apparent supply issues, this high-end screen might not be on all the iPhone 8 models, and Apple will instead include it on one version of the iPhone 8 Plus. \nDespite the larger screen size the phone itself might not be much bigger, as way back in 2015 we heard talk from Taiwan that Apple was working on a way to get rid of the home button and build Touch ID into the screen itself, eliminating the bezels in the process. \nMore recently, Apple blogger John Gruber made similar claims, saying that \"the entire face will be the display. And the Touch ID sensor will be somehow embedded in the display. The front-facing camera will somehow be embedded in the display. The speaker, everything. All the sensors will somehow be behind the display.\" \nAn unearthed Apple patent shows this idea in action, eliminating the phone's bezels in the process. This could cause the normal-sized iPhone 8 to be around the same dimensions as the 4.7-inch iPhone 7, but contain a screen that's closer to the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus. \nApple tweaked the home button with the iPhone 7, making it no longer physically click when pressed, so this could be the next step. On the other hand, you could argue that since Apple only just tweaked the button it's unlikely to ditch it so soon. \nThere's also the question of whether Apple would be able to produce enough of these panels. The company currently uses Japan Display for many of its screens, and while Japan Display is planning to start building OLED panels they're not expected to arrive before 2018. \nBut some rumors suggest only one model will have these new screen features, with supply chain sources saying that alongside the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus there'll be a third, premium model currently known as \"Ferrari\", and that this model alone will have an embedded fingerprint scanner and an edge-to-edge OLED display. \nLooking even further ahead we might see a flexible or even foldable iPhone, as Patently Apple has found a patent for just such a device, and more recently another similar patent has turned up, but this is likely a long way out yet. \nTechRadar's take: A move to OLED sooner or later seems inevitable, but Apple might only use the panels for the iPhone 8 Plus in 2017, if it can't source enough. A larger, sharper screen seems likely, but plans to build Touch ID into the screen sound ambitious, and while Apple is seemingly working on this we're not convinced the tech will be ready for the iPhone 8. iPhone 8 design A curved glass back Or the same design as the iPhone 7 \nApple's stuck with a largely similar design for the last three iPhones, so we're expecting a big change for the iPhone 8, not least because it will arrive on the iPhone's tenth anniversary. \nThat change could start with the material it's built from, as analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reckons the phone will have a curved glass back (as well as a curved screen), rather than being metal like the iPhone 7. \nThat rumor has since been given more weight, with the CEO of the company behind the iPhone's metal casing claiming that one model of the phone \"will adopt glass casing next year.\" \nIt would still require a metal frame apparently, which makes it sound a lot like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge , especially if both panels are curved. That lines up with a claim from a source that's proved reliable in the past that Apple is experimenting with a \"glass sandwich design.\" \nAnd yet another source also points to a glass back , with a stainless steel frame in place of the aluminum Apple currently uses in its phones. \nBut if you're a fan of metal backs you might be in luck, as the mention of \"one model\" going glass suggests the other won't, so perhaps we'll see a glass iPhone 7S but a metal iPhone 7S Plus, or vice versa. \nThen again, in a research note from respected analyst Ming-Chi Kuo it's been suggested that all iPhone 8 models will go glass. \nThe other major design change that's been rumored is the removal of the home button, with Touch ID instead being built into the screen. \nAll that said, a source in the Taiwanese supply chain claims the design won't be changing, other than the addition of a new red model, so don't count on huge changes. \nSome things are likely to stay the same either way. The headphone jack is almost certainly gone for good, and Apple has just added waterproofing to its phones, so we'd expect to see that again, though rumors from The Investor suggest it will improve the waterproofing slightly to an IP68 rating. \nTechRadar's take: Expect a big change to the design of the phone. It's too early to say for sure what that will be, but a glass back is believable and has solid sources backing it up. iPhone 8 camera and battery \nHottest leaks: Still just a single lens on the standard iPhone 8 Augmented reality features Wireless charging from 15ft \nWhile you might expect the dual-lens snapper found on the iPhone 7 Plus to filter down to the standard version of the iPhone 8 that's not likely, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who in a research note obtained by MacRumors claimed that the high cost and niche appeal of dual-lens cameras meant Apple would probably limit the tech to \"high-end\" models – likely meaning the iPhone 8 Plus. \nIn the same note he suggested that the telephoto lens in the dual-lens camera might get optical image stabilization (where currently only the wide-angle lens does), so that's one improvement we might see. \nOne analyst has said the iPhone 8 will come with a single sensor while there will be two models of the iPhone 8 Plus, both with", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T16:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T11:35:25.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
