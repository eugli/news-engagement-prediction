They've been recording parody songs and uploading them to YouTube. AIMEE: Every year the story is the same, we plant the seed into the ground and look into the sky for rain. Have you ever wondered what living on a farm is really like? Well that's exactly what Aimee is trying to teach the world through song. AIMEE: We grew it here 'cause we are farmers and we feed the world. AIMEE: Hi I'm Aimee. I'm from a small town in South Australia called Alawoona Its about a 3-hour drive away from Adelaide, which is that way. AIMEE: Living on a farm can be heaps of fun, but it's not always easy. It can be long, hot, tiring and stressful - especially during harvest time. So my Dad and I decided to brighten things up by making music parody videos! AIMEE: The Bulla Burra team, are ready to roll. AIMEE: We also have a theme in each video, like harvest, seeding or feeding the world. And we've even managed to get some of our Bulla Burra team involved. Even when they don't want to! Farmers singing: It's time for harvest again! It's time for harvest again! Aimee's videos are getting so popular they're now even getting hits overseas. AIMEE: We didn't think anyone would take much notice of them. But we've now had hundreds-of-thousands of views online and stacks of followers - it's awesome! FARMERS: I'm a farmer! I'm a farmer! I'm a farmer! And we all know that farmers feed the world. AIMEE: To be honest I think our friends and neighbours think we're a bit nuts but every now and again, we do catch them singing \"It's time for harvest again!\" or one of our other songs, so I think they like it! AIMEE: I really hope you enjoyed our videos and through them it makes you understand a bit more about where your food comes from and how fun farm life is! Bye! Discussion Questions 1.
