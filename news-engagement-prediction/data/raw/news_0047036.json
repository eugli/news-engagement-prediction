ESPN reported that Koloff suffered through a lengthy battle with liver disease that lasted at least 10 years. Ivan Koloff goes down in WWE history as was one of the few people to actually defeat Bruno Sammartino during his time on top of the company. \nIvan Koloff was one of the greatest heels in WWE history, taking on the role of the foreign Russian menace in an era where the Cold War raged on and many people feared the communist menace. In reality, Ivan Koloff was a Montreal, Canada, native named Oreal Perras. \nIt was Bruno Sammartino who personally scouted and brought Ivan Koloff to the WWE and the two enjoyed a long and violent feud. Sammartino, who had held the WWWF Championship for seven years, lost his title to Ivan Koloff in a match at Madison Square Garden. \nWhile Ivan Koloff was only meant to be a transitional champion so the WWE could put the title on Pedro Morales, it caused one of the most dangerous scenes in professional wrestling history. According to Bruno Sammartino at the time, he thought he had suffered a ruptured ear because everything went completely silent. \nHowever, Sammartino said that fans were crying in Madison Square Garden because their hero lost the world title to the evil Russian. Things grew dangerous after that when the crowd began to get restless and seemed ready to personally attack Ivan Koloff. \nThat was a true testament to the lengths that Ivan Koloff went to in order to keep kayfabe on his character. He was one of the most legitimately hated villains in the WWE even though people who knew him said that he was one of the nicest people they ever knew. Ivan Koloff set a great example for me in the way he treated people. So sad to lose such a great man. A true legend. https://t.co/nsgb3bCP6M \n— Mick Foley (@RealMickFoley) February 18, 2017 A fierce competitor in the ring who was able to anger (and excite!) fans worldwide.

Before The Iron Sheik became a tag team partner to Nikolai Volkoff, it was Ivan Koloff and Nikolai Volkoff who teamed up as the evil Russians. \nLater, when Ivan Koloff left the WWE and created a powerful faction in the NWA with Nikita Koloff and Krusher Krushchev, he developed a relationship with “Nature Boy” Ric Flair, who had his own major faction with the Four Horsemen. BEFORE THERE WAS IRON SHEIK THERE WAS IVAN KOLOFF. HERE WITH MY BROTHER NIKOLAI. HE MAKE THE GARDEN SHAKE.
