TVNZ has quoted marae secretary Mauri Komiti Tana Apiata as saying he offered it to Newshub first. \nWaitangi National Trust Board chairman Pita Paraone, a NZ First MP, said: \"it's bloody ridiculous and I'm ashamed to be a descendent of Ngapuhi\". \nHe urged media organisations not to pay the money sought. \nIf they wanted to give a koha that was fine. \n\"But for one moment I would not suggest they pay anything, particularly in response to this demand.\" \n\"It's greed and a lack of nous in terms of creating an amicable atmosphere between them and the rest of the community, not just the media.\" \nHe said it had made Ngapuhi \"the laughing stock of the iwi community\". \nNothing could be done this year, because the damage had been done even if Te Tii - also known as the lower marae - retracted the condition. \n\"Certainly for next year a lot of the goings on that have gone on to date so far, we certainly won't see. Because I am of the view that we should bypass the Waitangi marae, particularly if it remains under the leadership it has now, and we'll welcome our guests on the Treaty grounds.\" \nHe was yet to discuss that with the trust board, \nHe imagined Apiata had been given the authority to ask for the money by the trustees, \nNgapuhi elder King Taurua was also outraged by the costs and is on his way to Waitangi to \"sort it out\". \nTaurua has previously said how ashamed and embarrassed he is by the whole handling of the events and Prime Minister Bill English's treatment. \n\"I would just walk on if I was (the media) and ignore them,\" he said. \"I'm pissed off about the whole thing.\" \nLabour Te Tai Tokerau MP Kelvin Davis confirmed the figures being sought were $10,000 exclusive rights and $1200 general fee. \nHe said all media should \"boycott and ignore them\". \n\"Next year we'll do something completely different...it's just embarrassing for everyone.\" \nIt's understood Apiata told a 1 NEWS reporter he wanted to talk to the person who held \"a chequebook\", and said he was also prepared to offer media a position in a designated area on the marae grounds for $1200 to cover the powhiri. \nThe report follows similar controversies in the past, which included attempts to exclude the mainstream media and only let Maori media attend. Antics on the day have rarely been successful, but last year officials barred an Australian Sky News reporter from going on Te Tii Marae grounds. \nTVNZ has declared it does typically provide a \"koha\" or donation, of a few hundred dollars, to help with the ground's maintenance costs. \nNewshub is reporting the marae's communications liaison, known simply as 'Tana', had said the tradition of media companies gifting a koha to the Marae was scrapped, in favour of a 'coverage fee'. \nWaitangi marae chairman Ngati Kawa Taituha, who is said to be behind the fees, cannot be contacted for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T13:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T08:24:30.835+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
