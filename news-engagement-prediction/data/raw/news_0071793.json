REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst \nBEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Friday it has no intention of using currency devaluation to its advantage in trade, responding to an assertion from U.S. President Donald Trump that China is the \"grand champions\" of currency manipulation. \nTrump said in an interview with Reuters on Thursday he had not \"held back\" in his assessment that China manipulates its yuan currency, just hours after his new Treasury secretary pledged a more methodical approach to analysing Beijing's foreign exchange practices. \nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said he hoped the United States could \"fully and correctly\" view the exchange rate issue. \n\"China has no intention of seeking foreign trade advantages via an intentional devaluation of the renminbi. There is no basis for the continued devaluation of the renminbi,\" he told a daily media briefing in Beijing. \n\"If you must attach the label 'grand champion' to China, then I think China is a grand champion. But we are the grand champions of economic development,\" Geng added. \nThe Foreign Ministry has no say in currency policy, but it is the only Chinese government department that holds a daily briefing that foreign reporters attend. \nThe central People's Bank of China did not respond to a request for comment. \nTrump has frequently accused China of keeping its currency artificially low against the dollar to make Chinese exports cheaper, \"stealing\" American manufacturing jobs. \nBut he did not act on a campaign promise to declare China a currency manipulator on his first day in office. \nThe yuan fell 6.6 percent against the U.S. dollar in 2016, its biggest annual drop since 1994, as it was pressured by worries about slowing Chinese growth and more recently by a resurgent dollar, which has spurred capital outflows from many emerging markets. \nChinese authorities have taken a raft of steps in recent months to curb capital flight to support its weakening yuan, while trying to bring in more foreign investment. \nGeng said there was no basis for the continued devaluation of the renminbi and he hoped \"the relevant side can fully and correctly view the renminbi exchange rate issue\". \nBut China's foreign exchange regulator said this month the economy still faced weak global demand and financial market volatility caused by expectations of further interest rate rises by the U.S. Federal Reserve. \n(Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Writing by Philip Wen; Editing by Robert Birsel) Read the original article on Reuters .
