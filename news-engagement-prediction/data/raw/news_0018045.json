Ron had these two overstuffed brown couches and I had a small white one... His apartment looked like nobody lived there because he traveled for work all the time. My old space was perfect for a single gal about town but Ron didn't love my style. \nNeither couch would work for us in our new space (a one bedroom in DC's Petworth neighborhood) so we decided to purchase our first piece of furniture together: a Joybird couch! After lots of searching (and a few tears shed after the 10th less than fun shopping trip), we purchased the reversible sectional you see in our photos and love it so much. It goes perfectly with my mid century modern style and Ron's collection of masks, rugs and artwork from travels around the world (including the Moroccan rug he recently brought back from a trip). \nI livened up our newly joint space by pulling a bunch of travel treasures out of the closet and putting them front and center. I would describe our space as quirky, eclectic and fun. Nether of us are shy about colors or patterns and are having a great time making our first apartment together feel like home. We recently finished hanging a few things on the wall... including a tapestry from Ghana given to us by a friend which I stretched over a wooden frame and secured with pins on the other side. The part that is showing is about 1/6 of the whole thing — it is huge! \nI also work from home so having a desk space with tons of natural light is really important to us. \nWe're so proud of our first home together and are eager to share it with the all of you. \nThanks, Emily! \n• Interested in sharing your home with Apartment Therapy?
