The CFPB is asking Navient to compensate the borrowers the agency says were harmed. \nAmong other things, the CFPB alleges that since at least January 2010, Navient misallocated payments, steered struggling borrowers toward multiple forbearances instead of income-driven repayment plans, and provided unclear information about how to re-enroll in income-driven repayment plans and how to qualify for a co-signer release. \nNavient denied the CFPB's allegations in a statement the same day the suit was announced, saying they are false and politically motivated. The student loan giant, which broke off from Sallie Mae Bank, one of the largest lenders of private student loans, in 2014, currently services more than $300 billion in federal and private student loans for more than 12 million borrowers. \nThe Illinois and Washington attorneys general also filed suits against Navient on January 18. Navient said in subsequent statements the same day that allegations by the Illinois and Washington attorneys general were also politically driven and \"unfounded.\" \n\"Time will tell\" what impact these lawsuits have on borrowers, says Betsy Mayotte, director of consumer outreach and compliance at American Student Assistance, a nonprofit that helps students pay for college. But regardless of outcomes, borrowers should regularly check their student loan accounts to make sure their loans are being serviced correctly, she says. How to check if Navient is your loan servicer Your student loan servicer is the company you make payments to each month. It's not always the same company that lent you money in the first place. \nThe Department of Education is the lender for all federal student loans, but it contracts with private, third-party companies, including Navient, to handle loan servicing. Log on to the Federal Student Aid website to find your federal loan servicer. In addition to Navient, other major federal loan servicers include FedLoan Servicing, Great Lakes Higher Education Corporation & Affiliates and Nelnet. What to do if you're frustrated with your student loan servicer When it comes to student loan servicing, \"consumers cannot easily take their business elsewhere,\" Richard Cordray, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said in a statement Wednesday. \nIt is possible to switch student loan servicers through federal consolidation or student loan refinancing. But you shouldn't consolidate or refinance solely to switch servicers because there are potential risks associated with each, says Adam Minsky, a Boston-based lawyer specializing in student loans. Also, there's no guarantee you'll be better off with a different servicer. \n\"The other servicers aren't exactly rainbows and sunshine,\" Minsky says. \nIf you're stuck with your servicer, there are a number of things you can do to voice your concerns and protect yourself as a borrower: File complaints, check your credit report for errors, school yourself on your repayment options and watch out for companies that charge fees for student loan help.
