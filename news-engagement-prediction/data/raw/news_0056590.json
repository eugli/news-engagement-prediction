How Flower Essences Are Applied \nFlower essences enjoy a reputation of being highly effective and very safe to use. Flower essences, or flower drops as I like to call them, can be taken directly from the stock bottle. A few drops are typically applied under the tongue. Alternately, three to four drops of stock essences are mixed into a liter of purified water that is sipped throughout the day. \nSpecialized combinations of essences are commonly prepared in one ounce dosage bottles . A dosage bottle will normally last ten to fourteen days. \nThe medical community is not convinced that there is enough evidence to support the effectiveness of flower essences. This is fair, admittedly, vibrational energy is very difficult to measure by scientific means. Yet, in the holistic community, flower essences are favored by practitioners to address emotional and spiritual imbalances. People suffering from clinical depression or other mental health issues should contact a licensed mental health professional for treatment. Intuitively Selecting Flower Essences \nSelecting essences can in itself be a process of inner growth and awareness. Through quiet reflection, meditation, self observation, and consulting and conversation with others, it is possible to become aware of issues in our lives that demand our attention. These may be related to any area of our lives, our work, our relationships, or our personal selves. I tend to see the flowers visually with my third eye , yet when I cross reference my visuals in my flower essence resource books . I am always amazed at how accurate intuitive-chosen flowers are. Kinesiology testing is another way that people can use to select the appropriate essences for themselves. Helpful Tips: Standard dosage for flower essences is four to ten drops under the tongue four times per day. Potency is increased not by taking more drops at one time, but by increasing the frequency. You can benefit greatly by consulting an experienced flower essence practitioner. \nAlthough people occasionally notice immediate shifts when taking flower essences, others may experience difficulty perceiving any changes due to the gradual effects flower essences normally take. Taking flower drops over time will build a stronger and stabilizing influence in our relationships, in our attitudes, in our stresses, and in our overall state of well-being. Flower essences are not cure-alls. Flower essences are intended to be our helpers in aligning our life energy toward healthy growth and development. \nAn appropriate flower essence to keep near your computer for frequent use is yarrow. Yarrow essence helps relieve feelings of vulnerability and protects us from absorbing environmental influences (especially rampant within office atmospheres). When environmental and social forces threaten to overwhelm us... yarrow helps! Reader Response \nMarch 26, 2000 Dear Phylameana, Hi there! I enjoyed your articles about flower essences and therapies. I also work with them. I am an aromatherapist who basically deals with very concentrated vintage herbal infused oils that have set for over one year (you only use a couple of drops like essential oils at a fraction of the cost and get wonderful healing results) and until recently I bought all my flower essences until I was instructed to make them. So now I am in the process of making different rose petal colored essences for the chakras and as otherwise instructed for healing of the mind and body. The reason for this email is to thank you for putting the amount of brandy that is necessary to make your one ounce bottle from the mother bottle. I had thought that about 1/3 ounce of brandy was what was needed but could not find any specific reference to this until I ran across your article by \"accident.\" I feel that I now have confirmation on finishing up these bottles. I also am doing Chaste Berry/Vitex for the menopausal woman and yarrow which I now know why I had to make it up because of your article and the computer. I have been having problems with growth in the smaller bottles (no the mother bottle) and just needed a little help. Again, thank you very much for your sharing. I appreciate it very much. Thanks for being a mentor, R.E.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:28:38.754+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
