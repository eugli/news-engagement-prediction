Agencies also have the chance to negotiate changes before the blueprint is published in March.

And we will be substantially upgrading all of our military, all of our military, offensive, defensive, everything. Bigger and better and stronger than ever before,” he said. \nCritics question whether there is any need for a big increase in Pentagon spending when the military budget already stands at $600 billion a year.
