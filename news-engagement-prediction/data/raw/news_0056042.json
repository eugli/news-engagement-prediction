Sad!\" \nThe Town Hall Project, a group that serves as a one-stop shop of information for town hall protests across the country, is connected to a former Clinton staffer and is also closely affiliated with a number of liberal groups. \nThe group, which has been referenced by media outlets on numerous occasions , bills itself as a \"volunteer-powered, grassroots effort that empowers constituents across the country to have face-to-face conversations with their elected representatives.\" \nJimmy Dahman, a former field organizer for the Clinton campaign in Iowa, founded the Town Hall Project. Dahman claimed on CNN that the town hall events are \"all organic and happening at the grassroots level.\" \nDahman's group is closely involved with MoveOn.org, a major progressive activist group that recently launched a website, called ResistanceRecess.com , to encourage activists to attend town hall events. \nThe Town Hall Project's parent company is The Action Network, which was involved in demonstrations against Walmart and the protests in Ferguson. \nThe Action Network's board of directors includes Mark Fleischman, a former vice president of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU); Brian Young, who worked on campaigns for Howard Dean and John Kerry; Jeffrey Dugas, who worked for John Podesta's Center for American Progress and Elizabeth Warren's 2012 Senate campaign; and Rich Clayton, who worked for the SEIU and the shareholder activism arm of Change to Win, a labor group that describes itself as a \"strategic organizing center.\" \nThe Action Network is located at the same Washington, D.C., address as United We Dream, the \"largest immigrant youth-led organization in the nation.\" United We Dream has received funding from liberal billionaire George Soros. It began organizing \" sanctuary campus \" anti-Trump protests shortly after the election. \nThe Action Network also shares the same address as Change to Win, the labor organizing group. \nChange to Win's leadership council is chaired by James P. Hoffa, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Its secretary is Mary Kay Henry, president of the SEIU. \nThe Town Hall Project's website refers readers to the Indivisible Guide , a \"practical guide for resisting the Trump agenda.\" The guide includes information on how to \"organize local groups to fight for your congressional district\" and \"four local advocacy tactics that actually work.\" \nThe Town Hall Project did not return a request for comment by press time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:09:58.176+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
