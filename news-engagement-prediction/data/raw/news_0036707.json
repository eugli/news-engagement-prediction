That event combined classical and rapid chess. \nAt the moment the Norway Chess tournament has an average Elo of 2800 exactly. We'll have to wait and see if that will go up; the tournament will be using the June 2017 FIDE ratings. \n\"The fact that we are the first ones ever to bring together the top 10 players in the world in one tournament shows that Altibox Norway Chess has established itself as the strongest and one of the most important tournaments in the chess world,\" said the founder of the tournament, Kjell Madland. \n\"We have, since the tournamentâ€™s inception in 2013, wanted to create a unique chess tournament. This shows that we have succeeded.\" \nThe 2017 Altibox Norway Chess tournament takes place from June 5 to 17 at the Clarion Energy Hotel and at the Stavanger Concert Hall in Norway.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T03:18:36.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
