Louie Gohmert announced he decided to hold telephone town halls only because groups from what he called \"violent strains of the leftist ideology...are preying on public town halls to wreak havoc and threaten public safety.\" \nIn Arizona this week, Democrats organized what they billed as a \"search party\" to look for Republican Sen. Jeff Flake, taking their protest to the front yard of his house in suburban Phoenix. He was meeting with patients at Phoenix Children's Hospital at the time and had no town hall meetings scheduled this week. \nBack in Colorado, a Republican elected during the tea-party wave of 2010 traveled to Germany this week to attend the Munich Security Conference instead of returning home to his sprawling district about the size of Arkansas that includes the ski resort towns of Aspen and Telluride plus conservative ranching and mining towns. Some constituents of Rep. Scott Tipton were outraged. \n\"He has every right to be in Congress and he has every right to support President Trump. But if he's going to do that, he needs to tell us why and listen to our concerns,\" said Dylan Thomas, a Democrat from the small town of Eagle. \nBut the Republicans accused of going into hiding are getting some sympathy — from Democrats they defeated, including former Colorado Rep. Betsy Markey. \nBack in 2010, she held town hall meetings focusing on health care only to be greeted by a deluge of conservative protesters who showed up waving yellow \"Don't Tread on Me\" flags. \n\"They were pretty rowdy,\" Markey recalled with a chuckle. \nRepublicans who played their campaigns to take advantage of the tea party movement's populist appeal now need to learn to take what was dished out to the Democrats. \n\"That's why you were elected, to represent the people. You come back on weekends, you come back on breaks, and you talk to people — even if they don't like what you're doing,\" Markey said. \n___ \nAssociated Press writer Matt Volz in Helena, Montana, contributed to this report. \n___ \nKristen Wyatt can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/APkristenwyatt \n___ \nThis story corrects that the poster of Gardner made by protesters characterized him as \"Missing\" and not \"Wanted.\" \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press .
