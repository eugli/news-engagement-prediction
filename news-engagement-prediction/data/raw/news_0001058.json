It has also tapped a wellspring of anger in the French electorate and called into question the standard operating procedures of the political class. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The outrage has buffeted the establishment, rendering it ever more vulnerable to the same angry populist forces that have already upset politics as usual from Washington to London to Rome. France’s gilded political culture of immunity and privilege — free train and plane tickets, first-class travel, chauffeurs, all in a setting of marble and tapestries — can no longer be taken for granted, analysts warn. The perception of a political structure run by and for elites who use it to enrich themselves — sometimes corruptly, but more often perfectly legally — is helping propel the far-right National Front candidate, Marine Le Pen . “Nepotism is part of French institutional genetics,” said Matthieu Caron, an expert on government ethics at the University of Valenciennes. “It is unfortunately a ‘great’ French tradition.” The scandal over Mr. Fillon, he added, is “making the National Front’s day,” even as Ms. Le Pen’s party, too, faces its own no-show employment scandal in the European Parliament. The difference is that, unlike Mr. Fillon, who has campaigned on a platform of probity and high ethics, Ms. Le Pen has never “presented herself as the incarnation of republican morality,” Mr. Caron said. Though a fixture of France’s political landscape for over 40 years, the National Front has never held power at the top, and so can position itself outside the establishment. Just how much Mr. Fillon’s scandal has improved the Front’s chances of toppling the old order in elections this spring is among the most urgent questions facing France and Europe as a whole. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The uproar has similarly lifted the hopes of Emmanuel Macron, the former Rothschild banker and economy minister in the Socialist government, who is running an insurgent campaign atop his own newly formed political movement. The immediate problem facing Mr. Fillon from the revelations in The Canard Enchaîné newspaper is that it is not clear his family members actually worked for the money. France’s financial prosecutor is now looking into Mr. Fillon’s cozy monetary arrangements with his wife. His parliamentary offices were raided this week, he and his wife, Penelope, were questioned by the investigators, and Mr. Fillon has said he will bow out of the race if he is indicted. But it is telling of the decades of slow rot that have eaten into France’s political establishment that virtually no one in line to replace Mr. Fillon is untainted, either. Former prime minister Alain Juppé, defeated by Mr. Fillon in the November primary , was himself convicted in a no-show employment scheme. The runner-up, former president Nicolas Sarkozy, too, is a subject of multiple financial investigations into alleged improprieties.

Credit Eric Piermont/Agence   In France, to be a high-level member of the political class is to enter an exalted state where it appears O.K. to summon a professional shoeshiner to the presidential palace (one of President François Hollande’s top aides was forced to resign after that and similar revelations). Lunches with the minister are at least three courses with wine, served by gloved footmen in gilt-paneled chambers hung with tapestries. Which may explain why Mr. Fillon, 62 and also a former prime minister, sounded plaintive this week, defending himself at a Paris trade show. He had been in France’s Parliament for 30 years and his wife had been working for him that long, he said. “If they wanted to get me in trouble over this, they could have done it earlier,” he complained.
