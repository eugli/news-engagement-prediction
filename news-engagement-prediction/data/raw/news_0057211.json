Share via Twitter Instagram via @drewbarrymore It must be our lucky day (or should we say week?). For the last couple of days, Drew Barrymore has been sharing her favorite beauty products on Instagram with the hashtag #BeautyJunkieWeek. The 41-year-old actress posted two images showing off the hundreds of creams and potions stacked in her medicine cabinets, and you could easily mistake her bathroom for a mini cosmetics store. But out of all of the goodies she has tried, there are a few beauty products worthy of their own Instagram post. First, Barrymore praised Shea Moisture's Baby Healing Lotion ($13; walmart.com ) because it's safe enough for children and works just as great on adults. Then, she showed us her massive collection of foundation sticks ($9; walmart.com ) from her makeup brand Flower Beauty, which she says are perfect for touch-ups on the go. She even gave us a demonstration of how she wears one of her favorite masks. It's the Hanacure Multi-Action Treatment Mask ($29; hanacure.com ), and Barrymore says that when she takes it off, she feels 10 years younger. Her collection isn't all about skin care and makeup . Barrymore also revealed her favorite hair tools: A Babyliss Pro TT Tourmaline Titanium Travel Dryer ($30; bedbathandbeyond.com ) and the Wet Brush ($13; thewetbrush.com ). Barrymore's list of beauty products goes on and on, but her obsession isn't about trying to change who she isâ€”it's about being the best version of herself. \"All your beauty and hard-earned wisdom should be worn on your face like an elegant medal,\" Barrymore explained in one of the photo captions.
