We don't know if the bill will even be passed,\" Hansen said. \nSouth Taranaki District Council's corporate services group manager Phillippa Wilson said the council had only just received the Supreme Court's ruling and had not yet had time to consider it . \nShe said the council had spent a significant amount of time and effort on this issue since 2012, and had already been successful in the appeals to the High Court and the Court of Appeal. \n\"The costs to date are in excess of $320,000,\" she said. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T10:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T06:04:23.767+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
