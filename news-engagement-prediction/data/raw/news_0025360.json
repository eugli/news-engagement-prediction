Could   \nA homeless drunk now-turned-actor has been reunited with the Good Samaritan who stopped in the street, paid for him to stay in a B&B and turned his life round. \nFormer Royal Artillery gunner Phil Webb, 58, was contemplating suicide as he slept on the streets as he battled alcoholism, a lost job and his marriage breakdown. \nBut when Good Samaritan Stephen Finlayson, 36, walked past him in the road in Carlisle, Cumbria, in 2015 he felt compelled to stop and help. \nPersonal trainer Stephen, an ex-Armed Forces sniper, paid for Phil to stay in a B&B overnight then helped him get in touch with support groups. \nLast December recovering Phil starred in a theatre play about ex-squaddies called 'Wor Stories' that premiered at the Theatre Royal Newcastle.

I was pathetic. \n\"I went into an archway and started drinking . I sat with my head down. I didn't want anyone to see me and I didn't want to see anybody else. \n\"I just thought, I didn't want to commit suicide, but if I wouldn't have woke up I wouldn't have been bothered. Philip Webb was homeless but has turned his life around (Photo: Newcastle Chronicle) \n\"This fella tapped me on the shoulder and said: 'look mate, I don't usually help homeless people, but something told me to help you. \n\"'Come with me. We'll put you up for the night and we'll talk in the morning'.\" \nAfter a night in a bed and breakfast Phil's Good Samaritan put him in touch with the British Legion who helped with accommodation. Phil stopped drinking and got back on his feet. \nPhil added: \"It was a miracle, cos I just thought 'this stranger, or this angel, has come to help me. \n\"So I owe it to him, but more so I owe it to myself, to stop drinking.' \n\"I'm doing a course, an IT course. I'm also a voluntary worker. I help in a men's group. I'm also teaching social studies. Life is absolutely brilliant.\" Phil became homeless after his marriage collapsed (Photo: Newcastle Chronicle) \nIn just over a year Phil went from being a homeless drunk to performing, in front of a live audience. \nNow BBC Inside Out has tracked down Phil's Good Samaritan - fitness trainer and former sniper with the RAF Regiment Stephen who remembered helping Phil like it was yesterday. \nStephen said: \"I went up and just asked him: are you all right? - he kind of just said yeah, I'm all right. \n\"I left it at that and maybe got 20 metres down the road and I thought 'no, I can't leave him lying there.' \n\"I just think just that look, that look, that very look in his eye of just being totally scared. \n\"I've seen that look before and that's when you know someone's at rock bottom. He doesn't need food, he doesn't need a drink, he doesn't need a sleeping bag. \n\"He needs someone to pick him up and take him somewhere where he's going to be a lot safer than on the streets.\" The kindness of a Good Samaritan helped Phil get off the streets (Photo: Chronicle Live) \nStephen got Phil into the bed and breakfast with the help of his mum. \nChristine Finlayson, Stephen's mum said: \"He just came in he said Mam! Mam! I've seen this man. He's on the street. \n\"He needs help! He needs help! He's just sitting there. He's cold he's freezing. \n\"So we drove round and he was still sat there so we pulled the car up went over and spoke to him. \n\"I liked him that much I would have taken him home. Do you know that? I would have taken him home; he was such a nice man.\" \nStephen and Phil were reunited in the cafe Stephen first took Phil to on the night he helped him.

You've done everything for me. \n\"I just thought I couldn't get any lower. And I didn't really have any friends. The loneliness and despair. This feeling and then you came along. \n\"We sat at that table and chair behind you. We sat and had a coffee and thats when you told me you served in the artillery. \n\"I can't thank you enough. You just changed my life. I just needed that somebody. \n\"My mother used to have a little plaque in the hallway that said there's no such thing as strangers only friends we've never met. You were a friend that night. You really were.\" BBC Inside Out North East and Cumbria is shown on Monday 13 February at 7.30pm on BBC One and available on the BBC iPlayer afterwards.
