Dominic Cavendish , Theatre Critic 28 February 2017 • 8:01pm \nT here may not be as many actors who’ve played Hamlet as there are stars in the sky but the sheer quantity of those who’ve undertaken the roles in the past 400 years is beyond easy reckoning. When Andrew Scott steps into the role this week at the Almeida Theatre, following his Sherlock co-star Benedict Cumberbatch's blockbusting turn as Hamlet in 2015 (the fastest-selling and most in-demand theatre show of all-time), he will be treading in illustrious footsteps, from David Garrick and Edmund Kean in the 18th and 19th century through to Laurence Olivier, John Gielgud, Richard Burton and Paul Scofield in the mid-20th century. \nBut it’s the more recent Hamlets, those have sprung up along the way since Scott was born in 1976, that he will be most obviously compared to; there are some very tough acts to follow. \n10. Jude Law, Wyndham’s Theatre, 2009 Jude Law at Wyndham's Theatre in 2009 Credit: Alastair Muir/Alastair Muir \nLaw’s pretty-boy film-star baggage belied his accomplishments as a classical stage-actor and these were harnessed to physically dynamic, intellectually riveting effect in a production by Michael Grandage that had them queuing round the block. The distinctive feature of Law’s approach was to lend the character the air of a caged animal, full of mutinous energy, and letting that energy flow in a volatile fashion through the verse. You never quite knew how a line would land – flecked with fury or full of self-recrimination and whether his baleful gaze would hold or shift into something more boyish and good-natured. This was no lofty detached Hamlet but one burning with injustice; the more attractive for his ire. \n9. Ben Whishaw, Old Vic, 2004 Ben Whishaw at the Old Vic in 2004 Credit: Alastair Muir/Alastair Muir \nFresh out of Rada, with barely a stage-credit under his belt, 23-year-old Whishaw made his name by rising to director Trevor Nunn’s rare challenge, taking on this gruelling theatrical sorter of the men-from-the-boys and coming out on top. Gawky and gangling, he also was no mummy’s boy – angular, intense, seething with feeling. Not since David Warner played Hamlet at 24 for Peter Hall at the RSC in 1965 had the Dane attained such youth-appeal. \n8. David Tennant, RSC, 2008 David Tennant in the 2008 RSC production of Hamlet Credit: Alastair Muir/Alastair Muir \nSuch was the hoo-ha surrounding Tennant’s national treasure status, having rebooted the Doctor Who franchise with his winning smile and widened eyes, that jokes about sonic screwdrivers were par for the course when Gregory Doran’s production opened at Stratford. But Tennant, an RSC alumnus, swiftly dispelled the celebrity circus with a vigorous, mercurial and fiercely intelligent reading of the role; this was a jeans and T-shirt prince capable of making you laugh but waspish too in his wit; one of us, yet a rare, strange breed. \n7. Ian Charleson, National Theatre, 1989 \nIf there was any Hamlet of the past 25 years that embodied just how poignant and personal the role could become it was Ian Charleson’s valiant portrayal at the National in Richard Eyre’s production. Daniel Day-Lewis suddenly withdrew, mentally exhausted and emotionally overwhelmed by thoughts of his own father; and his place was supplied by an actor known to millions after playing the Olympic athlete Eric Liddell in Chariots of Fire. What was doubly impressive was that, known to only a few, Charleson was losing the battle against Aids, and so had to overleap every hurdle in the Shakespearean steeplechase with a body ravaged by illness. For those who saw him in action – Ian McKellen said that his “firm and sweet” voice lent the Olivier “the intimacy of a drawing-room” – the impression was unforgettable. Charleson died only eight weeks after his final performance aged 40 but his brief stint is still held as a feat that few other actors could match. \n6. Stephen Dillane, Gielgud Theatre, 1994 Stephen Dillane at the Gielgud Theatre, 1994 Credit: Alastair Muir/Alastair Muir \nPeter Hall delivered a four-hour version combining the folio and quarto texts that had at its centre the mercurial presence of Stephen Dillane as a prince who, taking his cue from that line about being “set naked” on the shores of Denmark, madly stripped to the buff after the Queen’s closet scene. What gave the production its sexy, modern appeal, though, was the way Dillane didn’t assert himself in the role – this was a recognisable man who shrugged and rolled his eyes in disbelief, adopted a sardonic, ironic tone and reasoned calmly with himself in his soliloquies. The Gielgud had only just ditched its former name (the Globe), lending an added pressure by association, but Dillane made the role his own as surely as Gielgud did. \nB uy dinner and theatre tickets to see Hamlet at the Barbican from Telegraph Box Office \n5. Kenneth Branagh, Phoenix Theatre 1988 \nAs directed by Derek Jacobi for Branagh’s Renaissance theatre company – which set the British stage ablaze in the late Eighties – this account included some notable elements, including the delivery of “To be or not to be” in the presence of Sophie Thompson’s Ophelia. When it briefly played at Elsinore, Prince Charles – a big fan of Branagh’s – attended a performance and was reportedly impressed. Branagh went on to deliver a more mature performance for the RSC four years later, but this production generated a rare degree of populist excitement, with its star’s qualities of thin-lipped calculation and quick-mettled charisma coming to the fore. \n4. Rory Kinnear, National Theatre, 2010 Rory Kinnear as Hamlet at the National in 2010 Credit: Ela Hawes \nKinnear, in Nicholas Hytner’s production, gave us an ordinary, slobbish, blokey hero retreating to his student bedsit lair and struggling to battle his lonely way through an impossible situation, delivering “To be or not to be” while smoking a cigarette. This is the most recent triumph Benedict Cumberbatch will be measured against; Kinnear won the Evening Standard Best Actor award. \n3. Mark Rylance, RSC, 1988 \nRylance has played Hamlet more than 400 times – his first outing, in a sign of early promise, as a high-school junior in Milwaukee. Although he was applauded in the role at the Globe in 2000, he made as great, if not greater, an impression in an RSC production by Ron Daniels that had him shuffling about the stage in long bed socks and vomit-stained striped pyjamas, resembling a volatile-minded patient in a lunatic asylum, and cleaving to Yorick’s skull as if to a talisman. When the production visited Broadmoor one of the inmates is said to have raved: “You were really mad - take it from me, I should know, I'm a loony.” \n2. Jonathan Pryce, Royal Court, 1980 \nIt’s astonishing how salient this performance has proved, both as a landmark in Pryce’s career and a benchmark by which modern Hamlets are judged. Richard Eyre’s production had a simple but powerful idea as to how to make the ghost of Hamlet’s father speak to a sceptical, secular audience: by having the prince utter his words as if in a state of possession, which effectively doesn’t leave him until revenge is complete – and “the rest is silence”; Pryce’s virtuosic suggestion of a man possessed and channelling his own tormented flesh and blood, coupled with his characteristic sensitivity and intelligence scored a palpable hit. \n1. Simon Russell Beale, National Theatre, 2000 Simon Russell Beale as Hamlet in 2000 Credit: Alastair Muir/Alastair Muir \n“Tubby or not tubby” – that was the inevitable gag as Russell Beale’s portly, relatively long in the tooth Hamlet took to the stage in John Caird’s revival. What emerged delighted everyone, not least the actor himself who said: “What came out was not what I had expected. He came out very soft, very sweet, he was a sweet Prince.” This was Hamlet as the eternal student, yearning for scholarship and his father, overwhelmed by grief and disgusted at the tainted world around him; when he observed that ''one may smile and smile and still be a villain”, he jotted the thought down, a typically telling and touching gesture. \nHamlet is at the Barbican until October 31; hamlet-barbican.com \nTelegraph subscribers can win one of five pairs of tickets to see Hamlet on Saturday, October 3, 2015.
