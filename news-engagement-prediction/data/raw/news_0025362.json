Images; From Rex/Shutterstock; By Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images. It’s 2017. Fear, uncertainty, and confusion reign. Perhaps more than ever, we could all use a hearty chuckle. Luckily, Sunday brings a great joke to lift your spirits: the Grammys! At this point, the Grammys’ ineptitude is as established an institution as, say, the Grammys themselves. It’s worth noting that, due to the awards’ perceived irrelevance and racial bias , three of this year’s most-nominated artists aren’t bothering to attend. Another past winner withdrew himself from consideration altogether. Ironically enough, these artists opted out in a year in which the Grammys, for once, didn’t get things so wrong. I mean, let’s not truffle-ize the Spam here: they’re still the Grammys. The Recording Academy nominated Lukas Graham's auricular, moldy Wonder Bread “7 Years” in two of the top categories (Song of the Year and Record of the Year). But voters got it less wrong than they usually do. The banner showdown this year is between two of this generation’s biggest pop stars, Adele and Beyoncé, who face off for three of the four top honors. One is the most broadly accessible entertainer of our day; the other, perhaps the most revered. One released 2016’s biggest-selling album; the other, its most critically decorated. One is white; the other is black. In a fraught political and cultural landscape where award shows are under frequent fire for favoring white artists , this year’s competition feels especially loaded. So, let’s break down everyone’s chances. Record of the Year What’s this one, again? ROY honors the performance of a song. Who won last year? Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars’ the Time pastiche, “Uptown Funk.” Who’s nominated this year? “Hello” by Adele, “Formation” by Beyoncé, “7 Years” by Lukas Graham, “Work” by Rihanna feat. Drake , and “Stressed Out” by 21 Pilots. What should win? I hate to be reductive, but “7 Years” is, quite objectively, one of the most horrendous songs to ever scale the Hot 100. It also lacks the cultural heft of the other nominees here. So that’s out. “Stressed Out,” at first blush, is very, “ugh, Linkin Park was irritating enough the first time around.” But while it captured some timely post-collegiate ennui, it would be hard to argue that it defined the year in music. The leaves us with “Formation,”“Work,” and “Hello,” all of which are deserving. But I would hand this one to “Work,” both Rihanna’s most improbable and most scintillating hit. With its gossamer dance-hall beat, “Work” hinges completely on Rih’s creamy vocal dexterity. The way her slippery patois melts the titular word all over the chorus is the song’s beguiling ace card. Is she slurring in ecstasy, vulnerability, lethargy, or all three? “Work,” like its performer, is meticulously crafted apathy, effortlessly conveying impenetrable cool while slyly beckoning us to peer beyond at the big, wounded heart that lies beneath. What will win? This award will almost certainly go to “Hello.” For four years, people wondered if Adele would duplicate the success of 21 ’s titanic (and Grammy-winning) singles, “Rolling in the Deep” and “Someone Like You.” While it didn’t exactly expand her palette, “Hello” answered with aplomb. It was the year’s biggest-selling single, helped fuel 25 to the largest first-week album sales in history, and ruled the Hot 100 for 10 consecutive weeks. Adele is the Meryl Streep of the Grammys, plain and simple. Best New Artist What’s this one, again? This award goes to the best artist who made a first significant impact this year. Who won last year? Meghan Trainor. Who’s nominated this year? Kelsea Ballerini, The Chainsmokers, Chance the Rapper. Maren Morris, and Anderson .Paak. Who should take the gold? Not only was Chance the Rapper’s Coloring Book one of the finest albums of 2016, but it’s already made Grammy history. Chance effectively lobbied for the album’s eligibility even though it was exclusively given away as a free digital download, a first in the Grammys’ 59-year run. Moreover, it’s an exuberant work, a glorious tightrope walk between gospel and mainstream hip-hop that’s always honest and never preachy. That it launched Chance into the pop stratosphere without selling a single copy makes him the obvious choice here. Who will take the gold? Ballerini and Morris are both charming country newcomers but seem a little too unrecognizable for the Academy’s mainstream tastes. The same goes for .Paak, one of hip-hop’s breakout stars who has yet to make a mark outside his base. This leaves Chance and the Chainsmokers. When it comes to the Chainsmokers, I don’t know her , but they did have two smash hits in 2016 and may be rewarded here. However, while the Grammys almost always favor innocuous white artists over paradigm-shifting black ones, Chance’s infectious positivity, religious tilt, and the Academy’s desire to be on the right side of a charged political environment give him the edge. Song of the Year What’s this one, again? SOY honors the writing of a song. Who won last year? Ed Sheeran’s John Mayer pastiche, “Thinking Out Loud.” Who’s nominated this year? “Formation” by Beyoncé, “Hello” by Adele, “I Took a Pill in Ibiza” by Mike Posner , “Love Yourself” by Justin Bieber , and “7 Years” by Lukas Graham. What should win the gold? “Formation” is a mission statement for Lemonade, a call to arms for the oppressed, and a club-eviscerating trap banger of epic proportions. That it functions equally well on each of these of terms while giving Beyoncé—20 years into her illustrious career—her signature hit makes “Formation” the clear winner here. It was the song we needed to hear most in 2016. What will win the gold? “Formation” is also highly controversial, a stance the Academy almost never strikes. Barring a concerted youth initiative to lavish Bieber in absentia (I wouldn’t count on it), “Hello,” should scoop this up as well. Some might say the Grammys and Adele need to get a room. And they have—the Staples Center, on February 12. Album of the Year What’s this one again? Album of the Year, believe it or not, aspires to award the best album of the year. Who won last year? Relative unknown Taylor Swift for her little-heard 1989. Who’s nominated this year? 25 by Adele, Lemonade by Beyoncé, Purpose by Justin Bieber, Views by Drake, and A Sailor’s Guide To Earth by Sturgill Simpson . Who should win the gold? When I mentioned earlier that the Grammys got it mostly right this year, I was referring mainly to this category. Four of these nominees were among the most important popular musical releases of the last 12 months. Sturgill Simpson is also there. That said, do I even need to delineate why Lemonade deserves this? O.K., fine: It’s the greatest singular work by the greatest singular pop star of the century. With her accompanying short film , a work that both enhanced the source material and stood completely on its own, Beyoncé again revolutionized the album format. The past year was rife with tension—political, racial, gender-related, and pretty much every other brand you can possibly imagine. Lemonade plunged into all of them, hat-first . It walked a delicate balance between fearlessness and grace, the personal and the political, and never faltered. The album spans nearly every genre of popular music—hip-hop, R&B, reggae, rock, trap, country, soul, funk—while remaining utterly cohesive and essentially Beyoncé. She kept the whole, goddamned thing—a massive project involving hundreds of people—a secret for two years! Finally: Beyoncé has never won Album of the Year. We, as a people, need to fix this. Who will win the gold? This is a real, honest-to-God nail-biter. First, the no-chancers. Purpose is technically a mediocre album with great singles, and Bieber is still too divisive for the Academy. Views, while a commercial juggernaut, is widely considered Drake’s worst album. This is a race between Adele, Beyoncé and, as a dark horse, Sturgill Simpson. I’ll get to Sturgill momentarily. Yes, the Grammys loves Adele, but she has won before for a significantly better album. There’s no question that Beyoncé deserves this award, at least based on any grounds on which the Grammys claims to operate. In fact, if Lemonade doesn’t win, there are, definitely, forces at work here other than an honest assessment of talent, cultural impact, and critical success. Finally, I’m going to go out on a limb here and say that Adele, whom I know personally (in my mind), wants Beyoncé to take this one because she is a good person with good taste who loves Beyoncé as much as the rest of us. However, Adele and Beyoncé could conceivably split the pop vote, allowing Sturgill to pull a Beck—a classic, highly suspect, Rock-ist Grammy move—and snatch this thing out from under the ladies’ noses. I’m choosing positivity as a life path, so it’s with utmost trepidation that I say Beyoncé will, finally, get her due here. I’m in formation. Here’s hoping!
