The airline is looking to set up two greenfield airports. - + Bangkok Airways is gearing up for a series of new business ventures, highlighted by two proposed greenfield airport development projects. \nPresident Puttipong Prasarttong-Osoth confirmed yesterday the airline is seeking to build an airport in Thailand and another in a neighbouring country. He declined to specify the sites of the proposed airports, which would revive the airline's long-standing unsuccessful bid to expand its airport portfolio. \nThe airline owns and operates three Thai airports in Samui, Sukhothai and Trat. \nDetails of the proposed airport development remained sketchy as Mr Puttipong said several processes must be approved by the relevant authorities. \nBut there have been industry suggestions the site in Thailand is in the southern province Phangnga, close to Phuket, while the other one is in Myanmar, possibly in Myeik in the south of that country. \nThe proposed foreign airport would be developed as a joint venture with local investors as required by the host country, while the Thai project would be a solo job, he said. \nBangkok Airways will no longer pursue opportunities to upgrade and run Thai airports owned and operated by the Department of Airports (DoA). The airline had wanted to operate a couple of DoA's 28 domestic airports that have commercial traffic viability such as Krabi, Mae Sot and Lampang. \nThe proposed airports would not be exclusive, meaning other airlines could use them, he said, denying allegations that Samui airport is only meant to serve Bangkok Airways flights. \nThis year the company is expediting investment in airport-related businesses to enhance its business performance. It also revealed it is building aircraft maintenance facilities at Suvarnabhumi and Sukhothai airports able to provide heavy-level service known as C-check. The Suvarnabhumi hangar would serve Bangkok Airways' own fleet while the one in Sukhothai would provide services for other fleets as well, he said. \nIt is also strengthening its subsidiary Bangkok Air Catering's operations by opening two more facilities at the Phuket airport this year and at Chiang Mai airport next year.
