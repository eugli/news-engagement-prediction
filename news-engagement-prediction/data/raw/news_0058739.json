While on the expressway near 127th, someone in the Impala shot at him. \nHe got off the expressway at 147th Street, and someone in the Impala then fired at a nearly identical vehicle driven by a female about a half-mile north of 147th Street, police said. \nNeither driver was injured, but both vehicles were struck. Police believe the second incident was a case of mistaken identity. \nTraffic was diverted at 127th Street while investigators looked for shell casings, police said. All lanes were reopened just before 6 p.m. \nAnyone with information should call state police at (847) 294-4400.
