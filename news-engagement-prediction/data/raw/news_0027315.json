Embedded from media.mtvnservices.com . \nWe’re officially one week away from the big day. The VH1 original series The Breaks isn’t set to hit our screens until February 20th, but in the meantime, we have a mega sneak peek into the first episode. The first five minutes of the drama-filled premiere kicks off with a kidnapping, before going straight to Nikki’s intense first day on the job. Tease: She bumps heads with Barry already!) DeeVee reacts to hearing Ahm’s record in public for the first time, and Barry has a minor confrontation over some money he owes. Yikes! \nCheck out the entire sneak peek above. And be sure to tune into The Breaks Monday, February 20th + 9/8c on VH1!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T05:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:30:01.265+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
