(Reuters) Honda Cars has acquired 380 acres in Gujarat to set up a new assembly line, though its two existing plants are running at half the installed capacity of 2.40 lakh units as its sales fell over 25 per cent last year. Honda has an assembly line each in Greater Noida near Delhi and Tapukura in Rajasthan with a combined capacity of 2.40 units. But in 2016, its sales plunged to 1,58,658, a steep 25.3 per cent decline from 2015 level when it had sold 2,12,372 units. Accordingly, its market share fell to seventh slot from fourth.\nWith this running rate, it is highly unlikely that Honda will be able it to meet its earlier target of selling 3,00,000 lakh cars in the country in 2017.\n“We have just completed acquisition of around 400 acres, to be precise 380 acres, at Vithalapur in Gujarat, though we have no immediate plans to set up a plant there. We have bought the land so that as and when we finalise the third plant, we have the land ready,” Honda Cars India chief executive Yoichiro Ueno said.\nHe said this is done as they are confident of the long-term potential of India and are committed to this market. With GDP clipping at 7 per cent, there isn’t any reason to be otherwise, and they want to participate in this growth story.\nYou may also like to watch this", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T04:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:50:18.323+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
