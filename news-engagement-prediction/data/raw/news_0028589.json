Johnathan Williams (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 10:55 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 10:55 p.m. ET \nWhen the first-ever March Madness bracket preview show took place Saturday, Gonzaga's seed was at the top of almost everyone's curiosity list. \nThe No. 1 Bulldogs, who were set to face off against conference foe Saint Mary's hours after the show, was only given the No. 4 overall seed despite being the best team in the nation with a perfect record. \nMORE: NCAA Top-16 rankings: Villanova No. 1 overall seed, but Florida State, Butler surprise \nThe Bulldogs came out on the road against the Gaels Saturday night and took care of business grabbing a 74-64 win to sweep the regular season series after getting swept by Saint Mary's last season. \nNot only has Gonzaga (26-0) cruised through the West Coast Conference, it also played a competitive non-conference schedule. Coach Mark Few has the band of transfers, recovering players from injuries and freshman playing as a cohesive unit that could topple anyone. \nEveryone knows Gonzaga has never made a Final Four in its program's history, but it has made the Elite 8 and Sweet 16 the last two seasons, respectively. \nThis season, the Bulldogs start three transfers (Nigel Williams-Goss, Johnathan Williams and Jordan Mathews). Add in the fact that star center Przemek Karnowski missed most of last season with an injury, and you have a team that could have had zero chemistry. \nInstead, Few has assembled a group of selfless playmakers willing to do anything to help their team win. This is also Gonzaga's best defensive team under Few. \nWilliams-Goss is the floor general. His ability to get everyone organized and keep the offense moving has earned him a spot on the Wooden Watch list, and it is thoroughly deserving. \nMathews is a dead-eye shooter that provides solid defense on the wing. He pairs with Silas Melson and Josh Perkins to form a dangerous backcourt with depth. \nBut Gonzaga's real strength is in the post. Karnowski, a 7-1, 300 pound center makes \"The Mountain\" on Game of Thrones look small. He can finish with either hand, plus he runs the court much better than one would think. \nThe Bulldogs also have Williams, a 6-9 power forward, who scored 17 points with nine rebounds in Saturday's win. He is agile on both ends of the court, and he can step outside and hit long-range shots. \nGonzaga's X-factor might be 7-0 freshman Zach Collins. A McDonald's All-American out of high school, he has shown the ability to score around the rim as well as in traffic. There may be a game or two during the NCAA Tournament in which Karnowski finds himself in foul trouble and Collins is asked to step up. \nHe will be able to step in and ensure the team doesn't miss a beat. \nOne misnomer about Gonzaga is that they don't play a tough schedule. It would be false to believe that sentiment. The Bulldogs beat the likes of Iowa State, Arizona, Tennessee and Florida before starting conference play. They have since won every game by double-figures. \nBracket fans may be tempted to balk at selecting Gonzaga to make a long run again this year, but just remember everyone said the same thing about Villanova until it cut down the nets last April. \nThis will be the year Gonzaga finally makes its first Final Four.
