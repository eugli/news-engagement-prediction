To be fair, the incident apparently occurred in autumn but was only reported Friday. \nThat’s just one of several tidbits from Aftonbladet ’s helpful rundown of everything that happened in the country on Sunday: 3:24 PM (local time): A man set himself on fire at Sergels torg, a plaza in central Stockholm. He was taken to the hospital with severe burns. There is so far no information on his motives but the intelligence service is not part of the investigation.6:42 PM: The famous singer Owe Thörnqvist had some technical problems during rehearsal for the singing competition ”Melodifestivalen”. (However, the 87 year old singer still managed to secure the victory the very next day.)8:23 PM: A man died in hospital, after an accident in the workplace earlier that day in the city of Borås.8:46 PM: Due to harsh weather in the northern parts of Sweden the road E10 was closed between Katterjåkk and Riksgränsen. Due to strong winds and snow in the region the Met office also issued an avalanche warning.12:17 AM: Police officers initiated a chase for a fleeing Peugeot through central parts of the Swedish capital of Stockholm. The pursuit ended in police officers ramming the suspect at Engelbrektsgatan. The driver is now accused of driving under the influence, traffic violation and car theft.IN LIGHTER NEWS:11:23 AM: Ok, let’s not be fake news, this story took place in the autumn, but was reported Friday before lunch and we thought you would like it. A wooden moose got the attention of a lovesick moose bull. It all happened in 79 year old Ove Lindqvist’s garden in Byske outside Skellefteå, northern Sweden. ”I thought it was going to start a fight, instead it humped the wooden moose thrice”, he said. \nTrump has said that his comments were in reference to a Fox News broadcast. Indeed, the cable news station played a clip that night from a Ami Horowitz’s controversial documentary that claims Sweden’s intake of Syrian refugees has led to a surge in rape incidents, a claim Swedish officials have said is unjustified .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T20:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T16:05:47.790+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
