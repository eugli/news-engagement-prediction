Karlos Isagani Zarate (INQUIRER FILE PHOTO) \nBayan Muna Rep. Carlos Zarate on Monday said the suspension of the peace talks between the government and the National Democratic Front is not yet final, and that there is still hope of resuming it. \nIn a press conference at the House of Representatives, Zarate said the Joint Agreement on Safety and Immunity Guarantees (Jasig) signed by both parties provides protocols on the official termination of the peace talks. \nREAD: Palace: Peace talks halt ‘deeply disappointing’ ADVERTISEMENT \nZarate said there is a 30-day notice in the Jasig for one party to issue a notice to another of the suspension or termination of peace talks which would only be effective 30 days after receipt of notice. \n“It has to be emphasized that talks have not been terminated officially. While the President already said his reasons, under the Jasig, there are protocols or modalities before there is the official termination of talks,” Zarate said. \nREAD: Duterte: No more peace talks with Reds without ‘compelling reason’ \nZarate said he remains hopeful that the peace talks would resume and that the falling out between the government and the communists would be resolved during the fourth round of peace negotiations in the Netherlands from Feb. 22 to 25, when both parties are expected to discuss the bilateral ceasefire agreement. \nBoth parties have lifted their unilateral ceasefire ahead of the talks, with the New People’s Army taking the lead supposedly due to the government’s failure to fulfill its promise of releasing the political prisoners. \n“While the flicker of hope is not yet gone, it’s important for the people of goodwill to support that. Our people deserve no less than a just and peaceful society,” Zarate said. \nZarate also would rather not comment on President Rodrigo Duterte’s scathing terrorist tag on the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), cautioning the parties not to add insult to injury. \n“I don’t want to add a statement to further inflame the situation, (which is already) very critical and sensitive,” said Zarate, who, like Duterte, hails from Mindanao. \nZarate also cautioned the police against re-arresting the NDF consultants and urged them to follow the court’s proceedings on their bail petitions, following Duterte’s call for the consultants to be re-arrested.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T08:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T08:34:55.929+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
