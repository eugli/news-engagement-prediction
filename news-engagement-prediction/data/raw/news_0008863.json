South Africa is to blame for breaking Lundi, says close friend \nSo far the foundation has given over 500 bursaries to deserving matriculants and Sbu told TshisaLIVE that he hopes to raise a million rand to help add to that number. \n\"We have done really well with the foundation but I think we can do so much more. Our aim is to now raise a million rand and really push the number of bursaries given much higher,\" Sbu said. \nLast year's benefit concert raised over R100,000 for the education fund. Sbu revealed that the foundation has already achieved that number this year through donations. \n\"Two entrepreneurs have already contributed to the benefit concert. So we've met our target for last year but now we just have to raise the remaining R900,000 to reach this year's target,\" said Sbu. \nSbu said that every single cent raised from the benefit concert would be put into the bursary fund and that all of the artists who perform on the day volunteered their services for free. Ntando Duma bids farewell to Rhythm City: 'I genuinely wish I could stay' \nIt is a labour of love that Sbu says comes from his desire to see South Africa become a global powerhouse. \n\"The only way that we as a nation are going to make an impact on the continent and the world is by providing a bright future for coming generations. Too many creative and intelligent people are never able to fulfill their potential, and contribute meaningfully to our society, because they are never given the opportunity to study further and develop their talents. \n\"That is what we aim to give these students with the Sbusiso Leope Education Foundation: a chance to improve themselves. A chance to make South Africa better,\" Sbu said. \nIn addition to the foundation's bursary program, Sbu also regularly conducts feeding schemes and motivational talks at disadvantaged schools across the country. \nTickets for this year's concert will be sold via Computicket at R150 for general access and R1,000 for VIP.
