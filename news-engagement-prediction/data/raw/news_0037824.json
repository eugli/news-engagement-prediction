The woman was using an Indonesian passport bearing the name Siti Aishah, from Serang in Banten province neighbouring Jakarta. \nHer date of birth was given as Feb 11, 1992, and her ethnicity stated as “Jawa”. \nSources said Siti Aishah may have abandoned the first suspect – the “LOL” girl – and sought refuge at the hotel in Ampang, waiting to flee the country once the “coast was clear”. \nThe first suspect, a woman bearing a Vietnamese passport under the name of Doan Thi Huong was arrested on Wednesday. \nPolice believe the two women and four men, currently being hunted by police, had done a “recce” at KLIA2 a day before the attack. \nSources said CCTV footages from that day showed six people walking around KLIA2, even being playful with each other and spraying liquid at each other while walking around the airport. \nThe police believe the suspects might have carefully planned the attack as they did a surveillance on the airport’s security a day earlier. \n“They might have been in the middle of choosing the right secluded spot to attack him at the departure hall,” the source said, adding that the four men could be the “brains” behind the attack. \nAs the hunt escalated, police stormed a third floor room of a hotel in Ampang at 2am yesterday to nab the woman known as Siti Aishah. \nShe had been staying there by herself since fleeing the airport after the killing. \nSources said the room was unlocked when they barged in. \nThey recovered a stack of cash in foreign currency, including three US$100 notes. \nThey also seized two mobile phones – one without a SIM card and the other with a local SIM card. \nAmong the other items found in her room were a Louis Vuitton purse, a shawl, Ray-Ban sunglasses and Charles and Keith shoes. \nThe sources said her boyfriend Muhammad Farid Jalaluddin, 26, had driven her from a hotel in Bandar Baru Salak Tinggi, where she had been staying with “Thi Huong”. \n“Thi Huong” was arrested on Wednesday as she was about to board a flight to Vietnam. \nFarid, however, is not a prime suspect. \n“He is not one of the prime suspects but he is assisting us with the investigation,” said Selangor police chief Comm Datuk Seri Abdul Samah Mat. \n“” \nHe said “Thi Huong” and “Siti Aishah” have been remanded until Feb 21. \nOn Monday, a taxi driver, who had transported “Thi Huong” from KLIA2 to her hotel in Bandar Baru Salak Tinggi was detained and questioned. \nSources said police are now trying to ascertain how the two women were linked to the four men still at large and what role Farid played in the whole matter. \nTwo Malaysian police officers also visited the North Korean Embassy in Jalan Batai in Bukit Damansara yesterday, presumably to meet ambassador Kang Chol. \nThey entered the compound of the embassy at around 12.50pm and left about 15 minutes later. \nThey refused to comment on the visit when met by reporters. \nOne of them, an assistant superintendant, told Bernama: “You should ask my boss. You can maybe wait for my boss to give a statement.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:55:15.797+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
