DISCOVERY \nKeck Observatory in Hawaii features the worldâ€™s largest and most scientifically productive optical and infrared telescopes. \nThe results are based on observations of 1600 stars taken over a 20-year period by US astronomers using the giant Keck-I telescope in Hawaii . \nREAD MORE: * Scientists believe they've found nine new planets \nThe Daily Mail reported the observations were part of the Lick-Carnegie Exoplanet Survey, which was started in 1996 by astronomers Steve Vogt and Geoffrey Marcy from the University of California and Paul Butler, from the Carnegie Institute of Science, in Washington. DISCOVERY \nMatt Mountain standing on Mauna Kea in Hawaii facing the Keck Observatory. \nDr Mikko Tuomi of the University of Hertfordshire said: \"It is fascinating to think that when we look at the nearest stars, all of them appear to have planets orbiting them. \n\"This is something astronomers were not convinced about, even as little as five years ago. \n\"These new planets also help us better understand the formation processes of planetary systems and provide interesting targets for future efforts to image the planets directly.\" \nThe group's paper has been accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal, the Daily Mail reported.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T06:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:59:20.410+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
