(Getty Images AsiaPac) Western Sydney Wanderers boss Tony Popovic has broken his silence on the banner displayed by fans during last weekend's Sydney Derby. Source: Tweet \nThe coach welcomed the response from both the club and Football Federation Australia as \"fantastic\" while stressing that anti-social behaviour must be eradicated from the game. \nWanderers were fined $20,000 on Thursday after a banner was held up by fans depicting Sydney FC manager Graham Arnold engaging in a sex act. \nThe FFA decided not to deduct competition points from the club after Wanderers management pledged to ban members of the Red and Black Bloc responsible, while threatening to shut down their allocated area at their home-ground definitively. \nInitially refusing to speak on the saga, Popovic was somewhat more elaborative when speaking to the media before his team traveled to Perth for Saturday's match against Glory. \n\"That's dealt with now, we've really got to move on from it,\" Popovic said on Friday before the team fly to Perth for Saturday night's clash with the Glory. \n\"The FFA has made a stance, the club has made a stance. \n\"We've got our values at our football club, we've got fantastic fans and I think it's made pretty clear there's no room for anti-social behaviour in football, or in sport, or anywhere in general.\" \nPopovic also expressed his disappointment that the incident took away from their drought-breaking win, but maintained it was crucial to stamp out such behaviour. \n\"It's important that we stamp that out, that's what we're trying to do,\" he said. \n\"But it's not just our club trying to do that. \n\"In any code of sport, any walk of life in society, that's a challenge we all have. \n\"That's the challenge presented for us, for the league, and we're doing the very best we can to stamp that out. \n\"I think there's been a fantastic stance by the club and FFA this week, and we've got to move on from that.\" Wanderers fined $20,000 for banner Western Sydney have been fined $20,000 after being found guilty by Football Federation Australia of bringing the game into disrepute after Wanderers fans had displayed an offensive banner during a match against Sydney FC.
