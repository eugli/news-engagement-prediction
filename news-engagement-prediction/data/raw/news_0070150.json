Thanks to his witty tweets and messages, the former India batsman has over 8.69 million followers on Twitter. And he is brutally straightforward when he is asked about his honest expressions, which are often not politically correct.\n\"BCCI had imposed a lot of restrictions when I was playing. But there has been no BCCI , no referees or umpires after being dropped from the Indian team,\" Sehwag said candidly during an interaction at SporTale on Wednesday .\n\"I don't care whether I am politically correct or not when I tweet. If I feel strongly about something, I don't bother what will people say, especial ly when it is about the co untry and the Army ,\" the Nawab of Najafgarh said.\"But my cricketer friends are all politically correct when they tweet. Only Harbhajan (Singh) is khulla (open) when it comes to expressing himself,\" he added.\nWhen asked about his impressive performances against Pakistan, the playerturned-commentator revealed the secret behind it.\"While playing against Pakistan in 1999, I could play only two balls and was there at the crease only for five minutes. But in those five minutes I got abused (sledged) by the players more than 200 times. So, later on when I batted against them, may be I was taking revenge for that,\" he said with a smile.\nOn a serious note, talking about Virat Kohli, Sehwag said the India captain is in the form of his life.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T08:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T06:15:08.963+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
