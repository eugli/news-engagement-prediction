His fear of hospitals was another factor in his lack of receiving any serious treatment. And even once Warhol finally went to see leading surgeon Dr Bjorn Thorbjarnarson - famous for treating the Shah of Iran - the artist pleaded for some kind of stay-at-home treatment. Dr Thorbjarnarson refused, however, and told Warhol he needed surgery. The artist caved and was admitted to New York Hospital (now NewYork-Presbyterian). The surgeon found a gallbladder full of gangrene, so much so that the organ fell to pieces upon removal. The revered artist had a fear of hospitals which delayed his ability to receive serious treatment Further medical records research showed Dr Ryan that Warhol was dehydrated and gaunt from having barely eaten in the previous month. Additionally, Warhol had been taking speed daily for years. And he was still feeling the effects of a brush with death in 1968 after he was shot by Valerie Solanas, a radical feminist writer. He had been declared dead in the emergency room and had nine damaged organs - Warhol's surgeon gave even odds on the artist lasting the night. His recovery left him a lifetime of trouble with eating and swallowing, as well as a split in his abdominal muscles that gave him a large hernia. So in 1987, on top of the gallbladder removal, Dr Thorbjarnarson had to repair Warhol's abdominal wall. According to reports, the operation seemed to go well, and Warhol was in his room making calls that evening. A private nurse who went to check on him at 4am said he still seemed fine. Warhol's bad luck should be thought of as less like a lightning strike than like being hit by a car while crossing the street Dr Stewart Walsh, National University of Ireland But about two hours later, she found Warhol blue and unresponsive, and resuscitation efforts failed. An autopsy concluded that 'ventricular fibrillation' was the cause of death, meaning that Warhol's heart had quivered and stopped. Stewart Redmond Walsh, a professor of vascular surgery at the National University of Ireland, Galway, has researched sudden death after surgery, and says it's more common than we think. He explained that when a sick body goes through the trauma of a major surgery, the entire body feels the stress, not just the organ being operated on, which can be fatal. Dr Walsh said although Warhol 'was unlucky', his bad luck should be thought of as less like a lightning strike than like being hit by a car while crossing the street. When Dr Ryan entered the data from Warhol's case into the new Surgical Risk Calculator of the American College of Surgeons, it put such a patient's chance of dying at 4.2 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:13:00.187+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
