Use your ears. (And your mouth, obviously.) \nIn 2014’s remix to “Or Nah” with Ty Dolla $ign, The Weeknd croons, “You can ride my face until you're drippin' cum.” This enthusiasm is not unnoticed. Not only does said scenario present a Twister-esque logistical puzzle in the sack, but it is a pat demonstration of how men—especially men who make a living singing about sex—are terribly misinformed when it comes to pleasing a woman with their mouth. EDITOR’S PICK Tom Ford on Sex, Death, and Penetration \nAs your first chat about the birds and the bees probably didn’t involve cunnilingus, many men did not grow up with access to this specific type of useful information. I asked men on Twitter where they typically learn from: responses ranged from the obvious (such as communicating with the first person they had sex with) to having an older girlfriend or friend with benefits school them. Others said they found lesbian porn to be useful, while a few referenced a specific PornHub tutorial and an episode of the HBO show Real Sex. (A few poor souls also mentioned the movie American Pie. No shade to all the actors and pies involved, but we have got to do better.) \nBut the key to going downtown on a woman is like anything else. You need thoughtful, productive communication to truly flourish. \nFrom a woman’s point of a view, some of the best partners are diligent about getting her off before any intercourse takes place. Foreplay is where you shoot your shot, and embracing cunninglingus (and your partner’s lower body), with commitment, is the key. “You can’t treat the warm-up lightly, you have to make an impression,” Maddie Houghton*, a 33-year-old athletic trainer and mother of three says. “Your game has to be on point.” \nMany of the women I talked to stressed the importance of hygiene; no one wants an STI because someone forgot to clip their fingernails. Enthusiasm is also important (never forget Abel), but this doesn’t mean you make out with a vagina like a 15-year-old virgin. Once again, awareness is crucial. Ask questions. Take cues and direction without your ego getting in the way of an orgasm. It’s okay to not know what you’re doing! But you have to pay attention to what she’s trying to tell you, as every woman gets off in different ways. The subtleties are important. \nOr maybe not-so-subtleties: “I think men should think of giving head like eating their last meal. They should savor every minute and be all sensual and shit cause if you don't enjoy it, 10/10 the woman you're giving head to isn't either,” explains Kari Faux, a rapper and singer from Arkansas. “Hum, make eye contact, and give compliments… Don't just use your tongue. Use your lips. Hell, put your whole face in it!” \nBrand strategist and married mother of two, Autumn Tyler, explains that after the birth of her children she sees a difference in her orgasms. “Since having kids, I find my orgasms are more intense if I get fingered at the same time as having my vagina licked... You basically need to be a multi-tasker.” \nClearly, it’s not a one-size-fits-all approach. Lauren Nostro, an editor at the annotation website Genius, practices a more zen-like philosophy. “Of course let's definitely lay down some of your freaky ass tongue tricks occasionally and like, go wild. But the majority of the time, I honestly treat that time as some form of meditation—like a full body massage. Don't do too much, let me relax and enjoy myself.” \nAre you ready for the tricky part? Overthinking it can kill the mood. I know. It’s not fair. Just remember that you don’t need to attempt to do the wildest, most insane oral tricks you found in the depths of your incognito-tabbing. It’s about bestowing pleasure and being in the moment, not auditioning for an AVN award. You can do it. Just, for the love of God, make sure your fingernails are clean. \n* Some names have been changed.
