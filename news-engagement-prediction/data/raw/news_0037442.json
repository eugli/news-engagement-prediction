Fazal Palejo, a senior health official in Sindh province, confirmed the toll. \nThe Islamic State group claimed the attack in a statement circulated by its Aamaq news agency, saying it had targeted a “Shiite gathering.” The Sunni extremist group views Shiites as apostates and has targeted Pakistan’s Shiite minority in the past. It views Sufi shrines like the one targeted Thursday as a form of idolatry. \n‘Bodies everywhere’ \nRaja Somro, who witnessed the attack, told a local TV network that hundreds of people were performing a spiritual dance known as the Dhamal when the bomber struck. \n“I saw bodies everywhere. I saw bodies of women and children,” he said. \nLocal TV showed graphic footage of the aftermath of the blast, with wounded worshippers crying out for help and the floors covered with shoes, blood and body parts. Women cried and beat their chests in grief. \nGhazanfar Shah, the custodian of the site, said security was lax at the shrine, which is entered through two gold-plated doors. \nPakistani authorities sealed the Torkham border crossing with Afghanistan for an indefinite period. According to the authorities, the border crossing was sealed for all kinds of trade and commercial activities due to security concerns, Dawn news reported. Pakistani volunteers carry the body of a victim from a hospital in the town of Sehwan. (AFP) \n‘No more restraint’ \nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif vowed that security forces would track down the perpetrators of the attack, according to Pakistani state TV. \n“Each drop of the nation’s blood shall be avenged, and avenged immediately,” Pakistan’s army chief, Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, said in a statement. “No more restraint for anyone.” \nThe US State Department condemned the attack and offered its support to Pakistan in bringing the perpetrators to justice. \n“We stand with the people of Pakistan in their fight against terrorism and remain committed to the security of the South Asia region,” said a statement by acting state department spokesman Mark Toner. \nA statement issued by the office of the spokesman for the UN secretary-general: “We extend our condolences to the families of the victims and to the Government and people of Pakistan, and wish a speedy recovery to the injured. We call for the perpetrators of this attack to be brought to justices swiftly.” \nThe statement said that the UN supports the government of Pakistan in its fight against terrorism in full respect of international and human rights norms. An injured child is treated at a local hospital in the town of Sehwan. (AFP) \nDeadliest since 2014 \nThursday’s attack was the deadliest in Pakistan since December 16, 2014, when militants assaulted an army-run school in Peshawar, killing 154 people, mostly schoolchildren. \nPakistan has been at war with the Taliban and other extremist groups for more than a decade. In recent years it has launched major offensives against militant strongholds in the tribal regions along the border with Afghanistan, but insurgents have continued to carry out attacks elsewhere in the country. \nThe Islamic State group has been expanding its presence in Pakistan in recent years and has claimed a number of deadly attacks, including a suicide bombing at another shrine in November 2016 that killed more than 50 people. \nThe government has downplayed the IS affiliate, insisting that only a small number of militants have pledged allegiance to the group. \nAfghanistan and Pakistan have long accused each other of failing to crack down on militants who operate along the porous border. \nThe army spokesman, Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor, said acts of terrorism were being carried out “from hostile powers and from sanctuaries in Afghanistan,” without elaborating. Pakistan closed the main Torkham border crossing with Afghanistan shortly after the attack. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T18:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T20:44:57.765+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
