Keep smiling! Mourinho of all people melts hearts with touching message to Ranieri \nThe Frenchman’s future with the Gunners is in serious doubt as he is yet to sign an extension to his contract that expires at the end of this season, and some reports have suggested the club are already looking for replacements . \nPart of that has also been down to Arsenal’s poor recent form, with defeats to Chelsea and Bayern Munich looking like all but ending their hopes of winning either the Premier League or the Champions League. Wenger’s most recent trophy win was the 2015 FA Cup (Picture: Getty) \nHowever, Keown feels his old boss could still salvage enough from this season to keep himself at the Emirates beyond 2016/17. \n‘The board and Arsene Wenger now need to decide whether he is the right man to go on. It’s as simple as that. Is it right for the club? Is it right for the owners?’ Keown told the Daily Mail .
