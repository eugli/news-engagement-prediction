But when it comes to TV ratings, the former celebrity businessman knows how to get people to tune in.\nThe former host of reality TV show The Apprentice brought a touch of theatrical suspense to politics on Tuesday with the announcement of his candidate for the Supreme Court.\nMr Trump began teasing the much-anticipated decision as early as last week. \"I think in my mind I know who it is,\" Mr Trump told Republicans at his hotel, according to mobile phone video of the event obtained by CNN. \"I think you're going to be very, very excited.\"\nI have made my decision on who I will nominate for The United States Supreme Court. It will be announced live on Tuesday at 8:00 P.M. (W.H.)\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017 T railing the Supreme Court announcement at the start of the week with a teaser on Twitter, Mr Trump said: \"I have made my decision on who I will nominate for The United States Supreme Court. It will be announced live on Tuesday at 8.00 P.M. (W.H.)\"\nThe timing ensured that networks would cut into prime time programming to broadcast the event. It also took place shortly before CNN’s live town hall with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.\n\"President Trump found out about our town hall meeting and thought he would upstage us,\" Ms Pelosi said. \nOn the day itself, he promoted the \"show\" by urging viewers to \"join me live from the White House tonight\" as he revealed who won the right to be on the Supreme Court via Facebook Live - a form of broadcasting that he used in the campaign .\nJoin me live from the @WhiteHouse at 8:00pm tonight. #SCOTUS https://t.co/7OJvZaW0Y7 pic.twitter.com/nJyeYyACQ1 \n— President Trump (@POTUS) January 31, 2017 S peculation had been rife in the build up about who it might be. Neil Gorsuch, William Pryor Jr, and Thomas Hardiman were seen as the frontrunners after Mr Trump produced a list of 21 potential justices in September . \nHaving whittled the list to two, Mr Trump heightened the suspense by summoning both \"finalists\" to Washington ahead of the big reveal - a highly unusual move for such an announcement, but an unsurprising one for a man given to putting showmanship above tradition. \nThe lucky two: Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, a federal appeals court from the Denver-based 10th Circuit, and Judge Thomas M. Hardiman of the Third Circuit, sitting in Pittsburgh.\nProfile | Neil Gorsuch \"Getting ready to deliver a VERY IMPORTANT DECISION! 8:00 P.M.\"the president tweeted shortly before showtime in a bid to ramp up the hype.\nE fforts were made to ensure there would be no \"spoilers\". Just hours before the president's announcement, his final decision was still being closely held - a level of secrecy out of character for Trump advisers and associates who sometimes discuss even private deliberations in the press.\nJudge Hardiman emerged as the favourite, two people close to the process told CNN - but they warned that Mr Trump could still change his mind and deliver a twist.\nAnd so it proved.\nWatch | Donald Trump nominates Neil Gorsuch to Supreme Court in flamboyant ceremony 01:16 W hen the time came and he announced Judge Neil Gorsuch, Mr Trump seemed to take joy in having kept people guessing to the end. \n\"Was that a surprise? Was it?\" Mr Trump said after bringing the Judge and his wife alongside him at the podium.\nMore than half a million people watched the announcement on Facebook Live. Ratings for the networks won't be known for at least a day but Mr Trump has shown in the past he sets great store by them.\nWow, television ratings just out: 31 million people watched the Inauguration, 11 million more than the very good ratings from 4 years ago!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 22, 2017 \"Wow, television ratings just out: 31 million people watched the Inauguration, 11 million more than the very good ratings from 4 years ago!\" Mr Trump tweeted after the inauguration. \nH e also boasted that he earned far greater ratings than the man who succeeded him as host of The Apprentice. \"Wow, the ratings are in and Arnold Schwarzenegger got \"swamped\" (or destroyed) by comparison to the ratings machine, DJT.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T10:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T05:54:21.107+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
