He said the DFO and CFIA have shut down multiple farms for the short term after testing positive for norovirus.\nSamadhin said that when oysters are contaminated with norovirus, it's usually due to contact with untreated sewage, but the investigation has yet to prove the exact cause of the current outbreak.\nNorovirus is a relatively common virus that can be contracted from many sources, Samadhin said — including those already infected, which can make it hard to find the original source.\n\"Those secondary transmission cases would've contracted the illness from somebody who was ill and not necessarily from direct contact with the food,\" Samadhin said.\nSamadhin said the nature of norovirus can make it hard to pin it to any one source, but health officials have shut down several farms that have tested positive. (Getty Images)\nFarmers concerned Keith Reid, owner of Odyssey/Stellar Bay Shellfish in Deep Bay, B.C., said his farm was closed for about a week-and-a -half while officials investigated before giving him the all clear.\nThough his sales remain strong, Reid says outbreaks like this are troubling due to the difficulty in tracking down the source.\n\"There are so many things shellfish are exposed to before they're finally eaten, so it's really hard to trace exactly where this is coming from,\" He said.\n\"It's important as an industry that we put product into the marketplace where we're confident that, no, this isn't going to make you sick.\"\nWhat to do Samadhin said the best way to avoid contracting norovirus from shellfish is to follow proper food safety practices.\nThis includes ensuring shellfish is cooked all the way through before eating it, keeping raw food separate from cooked food, and to wash your hands thoroughly — particularly if you've had contact with someone who is ill themselves.\nSymptoms of norovirus include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. (It's the same virus that causes the \"winter vomiting bug.\")\nSamadhin said people generally recover from the illness in a day or two and often don't seek medical attention.\nBut he said that if anyone gets sick after eating oysters, they should contact a health care provider and ensure that the case is reported to their local health authority.\nPHAC's full public health notice regarding the outbreak can be found on its website .\nWith files from Greg Rasmussen .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T21:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:33:01.513+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
