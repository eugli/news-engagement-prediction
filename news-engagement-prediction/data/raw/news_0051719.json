Image caption The £103m nuclear power station at Trawsfynydd was in operation between 1965 and 1991 \n\"If the 300 mega watt reactor was built there that would lead to 300 jobs as well as 300 associated jobs in the local area.\" \nThe Trawsfynydd site, the UK's only inland nuclear power station, was mothballed in 1991 after 26 years in operation. \nBut Deilwen Evans of anti-nuclear group CADNO warned: \"It is always the case that we accept jobs that imperil the community or do we go for jobs at any cost? \n\"Maybe 'small nuclear reactor' gives the impression that these are safer but they are totally experimental and totally new so we have nothing to go on apart from their say so. \n\"My concern is they have not been tried or tested. \n\"I don't believe in nuclear power because of the waste it makes and I believe there should be a public inquiry into the health effects of the last power station in this area.\" \nAs nuclear power stations become larger and more expensive, it is difficult to finance projects such as the £18bn Hinckley C nuclear power station in Somerset. \nSome in the nuclear industry believe the future lies with smaller reactors, which will be under discussion at Monday's conference in London. \nNuScale Power, an American company that designs and markets small modular reactors, hope to build a small-scale nuclear reactor within the next three years in the United States. \nBut it could be as late as 2030 when the first small scale reactor is up and running in the UK. \nThe UK government has invited companies, including Rolls Royce, to submit designs for small-scale reactors and it is expected that further policy announcements to be announced in the coming year.
