The Pokémon descends to the ground when it encounters cold air while it is floating.\" 190. Aipom The Pokemon Company \n\"Aipom’s tail ends in a hand-like appendage that can be cleverly manipulated. However, because the Pokémon uses its tail so much, its real hands have become rather clumsy.\" 191. Sunkern The Pokemon Company \n\"Sunkern tries to move as little as it possibly can.
