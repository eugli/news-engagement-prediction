Homebuilders by trade, the father-and-son team of Jeff and Josh Edwards are turning their two favorite hobbies of home brewing and competition barbecue into the newest brewpub in the Kansas City area. The pair have been home brewing for about 10 years and running a competition barbecue team called Building Smoke BBQ for the past five years. Now they're going pro with those hobbies, launching a new business called Smoke Brewing Co. in Lee's Summit. 10 photos Smoke Brewing Co. hopes to open their doors soon at 209 SE Main St. in Lee's Summit. Smoke Brewing is being put together at 209 SE Main St. The building, right in the heart of downtown, is about 100 years old and was used for many years as a shop for an auto glass company and an HVAC supplier, but most recently it was the location for a bar called Mingle. \"I just have a real love for downtown Lee's Summit and seeing what it has become over the last few years,\" Josh Edwards said. \"It's really becoming a destination spot. We've got places like Third Street Social, The W, and now we've got another brewery in Fringe Beerworks . We're seeing people come in from all over the metropolitan area and discovering this hidden jewel here. When we heard this space was available, we jumped on it. It's a great location.\" Constructing a brewpub Given the construction background of the owners, the building is going to look totally different than before. \"We got rid of the black ceiling and put in a three-tiered, lighter-colored ceiling,\" Edwards said. \"We put in a brand new storefront and added a garage door to it. We sandblasted the walls, floor and all of the stainless steel. We stripped this down to everything but the block walls and it's all been completely redone.\" The father-son team put in a few nice touches like using barrel staves for the lighting fixtures around the bar and barrel hoops to create chandeliers for the dining room. Wood paneling helps soften the bottom half of the exposed brick interior and ties into the smoke theme found throughout the building. Smoke Brewing's bar will seat 20 with room for an additional 130 people in the dining area. The brewpub also has a patio that can seat another 50. Crafting its own beers The ownership, which also includes Josh's wife, Lanni Edwards , and Jeff's wife, Renee Edwards , hired Bert Lightle as its brewmaster. He's the former president of the ZZ Hops Homebrew Club in Lee's Summit and is currently enrolled in the Siebel Institute of Technology's Advanced Brewing Theory program. Lightle is a hop-forward type of brewer, which will be a good complement to Edwards, who describes himself as more malt-forward. Edwards also hired Neil Witte , former field quality and training manager for Boulevard Brewing Co., to install their draft system and train their bartenders. \"You should be able to sit at the bar and have a real conversation with someone who knows a lot about our beers and beer in general,\" Edwards said. \"We want to get that interaction going.\" DATA: Kansas City's top area breweries Smoke's first beers will include an Irish red ale, a sweet milk stout, a pale ale, an IPA and an American wheat beer. They'll also bring in about seven other craft beers from around the region. But the bar won't just offer beer, it will be full service, complete with a wine selection. The kitchen will also have plenty of experience. The executive chef is Dan Patterson , formerly of Rieger Hotel Grill & Exchange, and his sous chef is Jacob Rose, formerly of The American restaurant. \"I think there is something incredibly neat and cool about taking simple food and adding something a little bit extra, so they're going to take my barbecue and put some exciting twists on it,\" Edwards said. \"The sides will be a bit different, probably something you've never tried before. Or if they are traditional, there will be tweaks and twists on it. So we wanted to make sure we had chefs with experience using lots of different ingredients.\" At the end of the day, the business will employ about 30 people, including 10 full-time employees. The opening day is still up in the air, but they're shooting for sometime in March or April, depending on when the beer is ready. \"We're shooting to open in early March, but I'm a big believer in getting things done right,\" Edwards said. \"So if the food and the beer aren't right, we may wait another month.\" James reports about banking, financial services and law.
