Freshman Daniel Jennings picked up a key 6-5 decision at 182 against Rahway's Sam Dorielan while Frank DeMaio and Aaron Dunn won by fall at 138 and 145, respectively. \nDespite losing at 220 and heavyweight, David Sanchez and Luis Abreu avoided giving up bonus points. DiPiano those two losses \"won him the match by saving six points.\" \nFrom there Dominic Cofone sealed the match with a 6-2 decision at 106 before Nutley forfeited the final weight to preserve its one-point victory on the road. \nWith the win, Nutley, the No. 5 seed, heads to Cranford to take on the top-seeded and state-ranked No. 4 Cougars in the semifinals on Wednesday. \n\"We know that we're out-matched, but we're going to go there, punch them in the mouth and see what happens,\" DiPiano said. \"It gives us the opportunity to win several bouts and put on a good showing to get us ready for Districts.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T11:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T09:25:20.274+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
