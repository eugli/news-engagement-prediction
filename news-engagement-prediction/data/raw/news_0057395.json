Other than burning calories, this route also appeals to one’s intellect as it encompasses the World Heritage Site of Mamallapuram; the Dutch fort at Sadras, which lies in ruins; the remains of the Alamparai Fort; and the erstwhile French town of Puducherry. Being close to the coast line, and consisting of rolling terrain, the elements of nature rule this stretch. The wind has a considerable role in determining the challenges in this 155-km trail. The route also offers a short detour through Auroville and the beaches along the long shoreline. This stretch is an ideal training ground for riders who aspire to take up long-distance endurance cycling. Bengaluru-Nandi Hills \nThe emergence of Bengaluru as the country’s IT hub also led to substantial growth in cycling as a form of fitness activity. New routes were explored — Bengaluru-Nandi Hill Loop is one of them. The scenic route sandwiched between development and nature includes a 7.5-km (6.5 gradient) climb uphill; the entire ride is 55 km from the heart of the city. Located close to Bengaluru Airport, a ride to this hill is considered a good training for climbs and is popular among the cycling fraternity that flocks here in large numbers during weekends.The hill also houses Tipu’s summer palace and fort, along with a few temples and other monuments. Kochi-Alleppey \nA fascinating sector that passes by renowned tourist destinations in Kerala, the trail has an added attraction — a cruise in a houseboat by the backwaters. This trail also comes with options — cyclists can either take the shorter route along NH 66, or the longer one through Kottayam and Changanacherry, totalling about 110 km. This passes through some scenic views, not to mention the coconut and arecanut groves and paddy fields that dot the route. There’s also great food to be had on this route — specialities include the popular kappa (tapioca) and fish curry. The terrain and weather can pose a challenge to the novice, but a proper diet and relaxed mind can help overcome the difficulties. Pollachi-Valparai \nA cycling trail in oneness with Nature, this stretch is a feast for the eyes and a challenge to the body. Located near Coimbatore and covering parts of the Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary and National Park, this 85-km route skips the highway. It begins from Pollachi, and criss-crosses Ambarampalayam, Sethumadai and Aliyar, from where starts the steep climb — consisting of almost 40 hairpin bends — and a short trip downhill before reaching Valparai. The route is interspersed with tea estates and waterfalls, and there’s always a chance of a surprise encounter with local fauna, including the Nilgiri tahr. Mention must be made of the padaneer (a palm-based drink) available at the foothill — it enhances the energy levels of riders. Coimbatore-Ooty \nBe it Tour de France or other popular cycling events across the globe, mountain stages and hill climbs form an integral part of the itinerary. Tamil Nadu has much to offer for cyclists looking for a ride to the heights. The climb to Ooty is considered the toughest even by veterans; the Kalhatti/Segur sector, where the climb gains 1, 200 metres elevation in about 12 km, is strenuous. The 87-km scenic route passes Mettupalayam before venturing into climb zone near the Black Thunder Amusement Park. You ascend the hills and cross the town of Coonoor, an ideal break point, before the final 20-km stretch to Ooty. At the finish point, indulge in some local home-made chocolates — nothing better to sweeten your day after a fulfilling ride. Chennai-Tirupati \nThis 147-km trail has many trekking sites en route, and the best option is to take the Tirupati Road after crossing Karanodai Bridge on NH 16. Riding past the green countryside and crossing Periyapalayam and Uthukottai, the scenic hills on either side of the road welcome one to Andhra Pradesh. Popular trekking stops on this route include Nagalapuram, Pitchatur and Kona Falls. And so, it is possible to combine cycling with a trek, provided you make arrangements for safe parking. From Puttur, the final stretch towards Tirupati could pose a challenge — riders have to cope with elevation and changing weather. But, with adequate hydration, you can pedal away. \nThe author is founder, Cycling Yogis", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T14:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:29:42.136+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
