The tech, the benefits. \nThe TX-55EZ952 features plenty of the new tech found in the TX-65EZ1002 , including a 4K HDR OLED panel that offers “unprecedented” black levels and super-accurate colours. \nThe screen is powered by Panasonic's latest Studio Colour HXC2 4K video processor, said to display the most accurate colours seen on a consumer television. \nThe Ultra HD 4K set supports HDR10 – the standard version of High Dynamic Range (HDR) you’ll find in 4K Blu-ray discs. \nSupport for HLG – Hybrid Log Gamma, the broadcast variant of HDR used by the BBC in its Planet Earth II 4K trials – will be available out of the box. There is no support for Dolby Vision HDR, however. Design and build \nOne of the benefits of OLED panels is the ability to design super-slim TVs. \nWhile the TX-55EZ952 doesn’t quite match the ultra-thin and bendy LG Wallpaper OLED , it’s still a fairly slim and smart-looking screen. \nThe TX-55EZ952 follows Panasonic’s “Art and Interior” design ethos, which amounts to a screen with the barest impression of a bezel, no visible seams between the premium materials used in the build, and dark metallic finishes accentuating the visible bits of the TV’s structure. More after the break \nThat includes the TX-55EZ952’s stand, a sensible rectangular pedestal that should easily fit most TV racks in your home. \nThe back panel is nothing flashy, but you'll find connections and inputs – including at least four HDMI inputs, ethernet port and TV aerials – hidden under a panel. \nThere’s no sign of the EZ1002 ’s ‘Dynamic Speaker Blade’ speakers tuned by Technics found on the TX-55EZ952. Instead, the 55in TV features normal speakers built into the set. Features \nTurn on the TX-55EZ952 and you’ll find that Panasonic’s My Home Screen 2.0 now encompasses what was formerly known as Firefox OS. \nWe were quite taken with Firefox's colourful and simple interface last year, so it's great to see that Panasonic has incorporated that user-friendly design into its 4K TVs. \nA key feature is being able to ‘pin’ apps - in the form of large, circular icons - onto the home screen for easy access. \nOther new features include a favourites folder for multiple users, a customisable My App button on the remote, and a revamped Media Player app that supports HDR10 and HLG content. \nThere's also support for streaming 4K HDR content from Netflix , Amazon Prime Video and YouTube. \nFor UK customers, there’s a new version of Freeview Play (offering all UK catch-up TV services like BBC iPlayer and All 4) with some handy tweaks to streamline the experience. \nThese include a new search and recommendation tool, a Quick Look Guide that shows past, present and future programmes from a particular channel, and live thumbnails that show what’s being broadcast on other channels. Performance \nThe 55in EZ952 has inherited much of the same technology found in the top-tier TX-65EZ1002. \nThe HXC2 4K processor driving the next-gen OLED panel is claimed to display the kind of colour accuracy previously only seen on professional studio monitors. \nThen there’s the promise of 1000 nits peak brightness and “zero blacks”, plus the ability to show nearly 100 per cent of the full DCI colour space. \nPanasonic’s main aim is to not just wow you with stunning bright whites and pitch-black blacks; but also to show off the details and gradations of shading found in those tricky extreme contrasts. \nAnd in our brief time with the TX-55EZ952, that’s exactly what comes across. \nThe bright lights of a show floor - with sunlight streaming in - isn’t the best environment to judge picture quality, let alone black levels, but the TX-55EZ952 gives the impression of a screen with strong contrast, crisp detail and stunning colour dynamism. \nDramatic footage of paint splashes, fabric and roses show off blues, reds and yellows that are deep, layered and pack a punch. \nColours look lush without being over-egged, and the screen comes across clean and crisp without feeling overly sharp. \nMORE: HDR TV: What is it? How can you get it? \nSkin tones and sparkling lights, even in the specially filmed 4K footage, come across looking luminous and vibrant. \nWhat the EZ952 doesn’t have is the EZ1002’s Absolute Black Filter - an anti-reflective filter that Panasonic says can absorb ambient light and reflections in order to keep black areas of an image as black as possible. \nIt's why the EZ1002 is dubbed “Master HDR OLED”, while the EZ952 is simply “OLED” in the company’s technical literature. \nThe TX-55EZ952 has to make do with a new HDR Brightness Enhancer, which optimises the OLED picture - especially in black levels - in brightly lit rooms. \nEven a casual glance at the two ranges side-by-side in the brightly lit environment show that the EZ1002 appears more intense in the blacks. It seems to reflect less of its environment, too. \nThat's not to say that the TZ-55EZ952 is grey in contrast; the dark areas are decidedly black, but it just appears a touch shinier than its flagship sibling. \nWe'll be interested to see just how much difference this makes once we get both sets into our suitably darkened testing rooms. Verdict \nWe’re excited that Panasonic has revealed more than one 4K OLED TV this year. \nWith a proposed price of €2500, the TX-55EZ952 isn’t cheap, but considering it’s packed with almost all of the cutting-edge 4K HDR technology found in the flagship EZ1002 OLED, we wouldn’t be surprised if it proves to be Panasonic’s most popular OLED screen. \nIt certainly impressed us. The TX-55EZ952 is due to arrive in June, and we expect it to put up a fierce fight against rival OLED TVs from LG and Sony . \nBut we'll reserve our final judgement - and the full review - until we have our very own sample in the What Hi-Fi? testing rooms.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T09:08:33.190+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
