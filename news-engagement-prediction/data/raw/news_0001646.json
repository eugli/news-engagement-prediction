the Trump tariff The Street 1 day ago Jason Notte Cramer's top Mexican beer stock to play if Trump imposes a tariff on Mexican imports CNBC\nU.S. beer drinkers are in love with Mexican beer, and that love's about to hurt.\nLast week, President Donald Trump and his administration floated the idea of paying for a wall between the United States and Mexico by imposing a 20% on all imports from Mexico. Though that tariff would eventually apply to all countries with which the U.S. has a trade deficit (and the U.S. deficit with Mexico was $58 million back in 2015), both the Trump administration and Republican leadership said the tariff was among a \"buffet of options\" available to pay for the estimated $12 billion to $15 billion it will cost to build the wall.\nHowever, when U.S. consumers stroll over to that buffet of added costs, they don't necessarily see costly imported tomatoes or automobiles: they see beer. The New York Post 's January 27 cover accused Trump of wanting to \"Tax Coronas To Pay For Wall.\" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) mentioned Mexican beer specifically while tweeting his opposition.\nSimply put, any policy proposal which drives up costs of Corona, tequila, or margaritas is a big-time bad idea. Mucho Sad. — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) January 26, 2017\nPerhaps nobody knows this better than Victor, N.Y.-based beer, wine and spirits company Constellation Brands . Before 2013, Constellation brewed no beer on its own. However, its Crown Imports has had exclusive U.S. distribution rights to the Grupo Modelo brands -- including Corona, Modelo, Negra Modelo, Pacifico and Victoria -- since 2007 and had been distributing them in the Western U.S. since buying Chicago-based distributor Barton Beers in 1993.\nConstellation Brands only got into brewing after the Department of Justice ruled that Anheuser-Busch InBev's 2013 purchase of Grupo Modelo for $20.1 billion violated U.S. antitrust laws. Constellation was awarded the U.S. rights to the Grupo Modelo brands and, after sealing a $4.75 billion deal with A-B InBev in June 2013, began producing beer for the U.S. market at a facility in Nava, Mexico.\nBy the middle of 2015, with a whole lot of help from Constellation's beers, Nielsen noted that Mexican beer sales made up 7.8% of all U.S. beer sales by volume. Though their 10.2% growth from the same period a year earlier matched that of U.S. craft beer, Mexican brands' share beer industry was greater than craft's 7.6%.\nBehind the success of the Grupo Modelo brands, Constellation Brands expanded the brewery in Nava, opened a glass plant next to the Nava brewery to produce its own bottles and invested in a second brewery in Mexicali. The success of all of the above enabled Constellation Brands to purchase 20-year-old San Diego brewery Ballast Point for $1 billion in Nov. 2015.\nThat move seemed designed to parry Heineken USA, whose Dos Equis and Tecate Mexican lager compete with Constellation's Grupo Modelo brands and who bought a half stake in Petaluma, Calif.-based Lagunitas Brewing Company for a reported $500 million in 2015.\nIt's also a direct shot at U.S. craft beer brewers who've tried to harness some of the Mexican brands' magic. We noted a few years ago that Mexican beer dates back to Hernan Cortez in the 1500s but takes its current cues from the Germans and Austrians who arrived during the Second Mexican Empire under Maximillian I in the 1800s. The Vienna malt that gives Vienna Lagers like Negra Modelo and Dos Equis Amber their color also helps make Mexican lagers slightly sweeter than their German- and Czech-influenced U.S. counterparts.\nU.S. craft brewers have taken a crack at their own \"Mexican\" lagers in recent years. It's what Longmont, Colo.-based Oskar Blues emulates in its Beerito and what San Francisco's 21st Amendment seeks when producing 15-packs of El Sully. The problem is that there isn't any one \"Mexican style,\" and U.S. craft versions of those lagers in no way represent their more inspired counterparts in Mexican craft beer coming out of Mexico today. It's why Los Angeles-based Pabst Brewing Company partnered with Mexican craft brewer Minerva last year to expand that brand's presence in the United States.\nAccording to beer industry publication Beer Marketer's Insights , both Constellation's Corona Extra and Modelo Especial now rank among the nation's Top 10 brands. Modelo, in particular, has seen growth around 20% each year four the last four years. Heineken's Dos Equis routinely finds itself in the Top 20 thanks to Corona-like growth, but it trails both Model and Corona by 4 million to 7 million barrels, respectively.\nInstead of waiting around for the Trump administration to dilute that growth, however, companies are taking their case against the proposed tariff to D.C. Constellation Brands recently hired lobbying firm Heather Podesta + Partners and poured $40,000 into lobbying efforts at the end of last year. It's also retained firms Barnes & Thornburg and McDermott, Will & Emery to represent its interests, dumping a combined $360,000 into lobbying efforts last year, including $160,000 dedicated to its Crown Imports branch that brings in Mexican beers.\nThose efforts may have worked, as Sen. Graham is not the only Republican member of the Senate to speak out about the Trump administration's Mexico tariff. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) suggested that trade with Texas has worked out well for the U.S. and called for caution in proceeding with it.\nMany unanswered questions about proposed \"border adjustment\" tax — JohnCornyn (@JohnCornyn) January 26, 2017\nSenators Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) both expressed concern, with Sasse calling the tariff a \"tax on American families.\" Though the tariff may end up being outright illegal and is still far from a done deal, the looming threat of a 20% price hike on Mexican beer brands would have a noticeable impact on the marketplace.\nWithout discerning how large companies like Constellation Brands and Heineken would handle such a tariff (increase the price of just the Mexican brands? Spread the increase around to other products?) or how distributors and retailers would handle those increases themselves, we took a wander through Total Wine in Vancouver, Wash., and came up with the per-bottle price of 12-packs of popular Mexican beer brands and determined just how much a 20% bump would increase costs.\nClick ahead to see what we found.\nCorona Extra\n© Provided by Thestreet.com Constellation Brands\n12-pack price: $13.99\nPrice per bottle/can: $1.17\n12-pack price after tariff: $16.79\nPrice per bottle or can: $1.40\nCorona has helped make Constellation the third-largest brewer and importer in the U.S. behind just Anheuser-Busch InBev and MillerCoors.\nThe 16 million barrels it produced in 2015 was almost double the output of fourth-place Heineken USA, while the nearly 8.5 million barrel of Corona Extra it produced was equal to the total amount produced by all of Heineken USA's brands combined. Corona is nobody's underdog and, at this price, it's still offering a bargain for the money.\nModelo Especial/Modelo Negra\n© Provided by Thestreet.com Constellation Brands\n12-pack price: $15.49\nPrice per bottle/can: $1.29\n12-pack price after tariff: $18.59\nPrice per bottle or can: $1.55\nWe'll admit, we miss the old Negra Modelo labels and gold foil, but we understand why Constellation Brands tried to get the branding in line with Modelo Especial.\nJust four years ago, Modelo was sold in lesser quantities in the U.S. thanks to Keystone Light, Miller High Life and Heineken. However, with Constellation pushing it through retailers and pinpointed advertising (spots for the 2014 World Cup come to mind), it gained nearly 2.5 million barrels between 2011 and 2015.\nThat's basically like gaining a brewery the size of Yuengling in Pottsville, Pa., or gaining a brand roughly the size of Pabst Blue Ribbon. It's phenomenal growth and, even better for consumer, it's available at $13.99 if you switch to cans. Whatever pain Corona feels from the coming tariffs, Modelo Especial will take the same hurt.\nPacifico\n© Provided by Thestreet.com Constellation Brands\n12-pack price: $13.99\nPrice per bottle/can: $1.17\n12-pack price after tariff: $16.79\nPrice per bottle or can: $1.40\nNo, it isn't just Corona in a brown bottle. Pacifico dates back to 1900, when a trio of German nationals opened Cerveceria del Pacífico in Mazatlán.\nThis near-Pilsner from Sinaloa was rolled up into Grupo Modelo in 1954, but even the Clara version that makes its way here to the states isn't the brewery's whole story. Its counterpart, the dark \"Pacifico Oscura,\" never quite made its way North... which is a shame, considering how enjoyable Mexican Vienna lagers tend to be.\nVictoria\n© Provided by Thestreet.com Constellation Brands\n12-pack price: $15.49\nPrice per bottle/can: $1.29\n12-pack price after tariff: $18.59\nPrice per bottle or can: $1.55\nSpeaking of Vienna lager, Victoria's dates back to 1865 and has been part of the Grupo Modelo portfolio since before World War II.\nWhile U.S. craft brewers have turned Vienna lager into a sweeter, more potent version of the Austrian original, Victoria and others took it in the other direction: holding alcohol content to 4% alcohol by volume and making it a far more refreshing beer. There's no reason to be scared of the dark.\nDos Equis Lager/Ambar\n© Provided by Thestreet.com Heineken USA\n12-pack price: $13.49\nPrice per bottle/can: $1.12\n12-pack price after tariff: $16.19\nPrice per bottle or can: $1.35\nThe 1.9 million barrels of Dos Equis sold in 2015 was nearly 400,000 barrels more than it was just two years earlier. That's growth equivalent to adding an entire craft brewer roughly the size of Deschutes, Bell's or Stone.\nThat's also given Dos Equis a presence in the U.S. larger than that of Sierra Nevada, New Belgium, Lagunitas or even Anheuser-Busch InBev-owned Goose Island. The Most Interesting Man in the World knows his way around beer, and is making Heineken -- an international beer power -- a more formidable presence stateside.\nSol\n© Provided by Thestreet.com Heineken USA\n12-pack price: $15.49\nPrice per bottle/can: $1.29\n12-pack price after tariff: $18.59\nPrice per bottle or can: $1.55\nHeineken-owned Cervecería Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma has been making this beer since the 1890s, but we only get the most basic pale-lager version of it.\nNo Sol Brava dark beer, no Sol with salt and lime, no Sol with Clamato... just this. It explains why you don't see a whole lot of it around in comparison to Dos Equis or Corona, but it's yet another reminder about how small a window into Mexican brewing we're offered in the U.S. ... even without a wall.\nBohemia\n© Provided by Thestreet.com Heineken USA\n12-pack price: $15.49\nPrice per bottle/can: $1.29\n12-pack price after tariff: $18.59\nPrice per bottle or can: $1.55\nA Mexican beer named after a Czech region that draws from pale pilsners more closely aligned with that region. Bohemia comes in Vienna lagers and Weizens back in Mexico, but here it's just an interesting anomaly and a reminder of Mexico's rich, if Eastern European-influenced brewing history.\nTecate\n© Provided by Thestreet.com Heineken USA\n12-pack price: $9.99\nPrice per bottle/can: $0.83\n12-pack price after tariff: $11.99\nPrice per bottle or can: $1\nIt's exactly what you think it is: an economy lager brewed in Baja about an hour from San Diego. In its nearly 75 years of existence, its brewery in Tecate has produced a light lager that's inexpensive, typically best enjoyed in cans and that comes in a light version that appeals to calorie-counting U.S. consumers.\nIt gets a bad rap for its cost-effective nature and packaging, but it's succeeding with all of the strategies that U.S. light lagers once not only embraced, but mastered.\nEstrella Jalisco\n© Provided by Thestreet.com Anheuser-Busch InBev\n12-pack price: $9.49\nPrice per bottle/can $0.79\n12-pack price after tariff: $11.39\nPrice per bottle or can: $0.95\nNo, Anheuser-Busch InBev couldn't sell established Grupo Modelo brands here in the U.S. However, nobody ever said the company couldn't boost a brand in their Grupo Modelo brewery and import that to the U.S.\nThat's exactly what A-B did with Estrella Jalisco -- a brand that dates back to the end of the 1800s in Western Mexico -- when the company launched it in ten states last year.\nConsidering that U.S. sales of Budweiser and Bud Light continue to slump as Mexican brewers' sales soar, it's unsurprising that A-B was unwilling to relinquish the U.S. market completely after the Grupo Modelo deal.\nMontejo\n© Provided by Thestreet.com Anheuser-Busch InBev\n12-pack price: $12.49\nPrice per bottle/can: $1.04\n12-pack price after tariff: $14.99\nPrice per bottle or can: $1.25\nFirst introduced in the U.S. in 2014 with a splashy debut at Dodger Stadium, Montejo was distributed to a handful of states in an attempt to target Latino drinkers.\nThe problem? Montejo may be known in Mérida, Yucatán, where it was first brewed by the Cervecería Yucateca in 1960, but it's fairly regional and obscure even in Mexico. It doesn't exactly set the world on fire here, but at a buck a beer, it hits that magic number for affordability set by economy beer drinkers.\nIt's a beer like this that takes a beating from even a fairly minor price hike, never mind a 20% boost. Despite having Anheuser-Busch InBev in its corner, Montejo -- unlike rock-bottom-priced Tecate -- looks awfully vulnerable in the face of changing political and economic tides.\nMore on MSN Money:\nThe 10 biggest companies you've never heard of\nThe World's Priciest (& Cheapest) Cities to Live in 2017\n5 Reasons Warren Buffett Suddenly Loves Airline Stocks\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BenSasse/status/824743918067707904", "http://thestreet.com/", "http://cnbc.com/", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBxZlX8?blobrefkey=en-us&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;culture&quot;:&quot;en-us&quot;}", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;DomainId&quot;:", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBxZlX8?blobrefkey=1001&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;102&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBxZlX8?blobrefkey=102&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;640&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;360&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;103&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBxZmfc.img&quot;}}", "https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/824734113412345856", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBhb5Hu.img", "https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f00%2fen-us%2fBBxZlX8%3focid%3dsl&title=Cramer%27s+top+Mexican+beer+stock+to+play+if+Trump+imposes+a+tariff+on+Mexican+imports&source=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f00%2fen-us%2fBBxZlX8%3focid%3dsl", "http://vapi.cnbc.com/videoservice/rssvideosearch.do?partnerId=8020&quot;}", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f00%2fen-us%2fBBxZlX8%3focid%3dst&text=Cramer%27s+top+Mexican+beer+stock+to+play+if+Trump+imposes+a+tariff+on+Mexican+imports&original_referer=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f00%2fen-us%2fBBxZlX8%3focid%3dst", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6Dp75.img", "https://www.thestreet.com/story/13914882/1/why-trump-s-tariff-might-be-illegal.html", "https://web.skype.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f00%2fen-us%2fBBxZlX8&lang=en-us&flow_id=a1959663-666a-4ed9-80e8-a55f37dfedbb", "http://wus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/14150bf7-945e-45ba-b53a-de2a001b8fa4/c5b012dc-2efa-47e2-a36f-c1933f24ce3a.ism&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;1006&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://wus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/14150bf7-945e-45ba-b53a-de2a001b8fa4/c5b012dc-2efa-47e2-a36f-c1933f24ce3a.ism/manifest(format=m3u8-aapl)&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;104&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;htt", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBxZlX8?blobrefkey=101&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;320&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;180&quot;}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA3ltd8.img", "https://twitter.com/JohnCornyn/status/824730095378169856"], "published": "2017-02-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T08:27:04.815+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
