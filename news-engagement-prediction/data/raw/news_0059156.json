It can also simulate the effects of reverberation and reflections based on the space you’re playing in. Plus, it can trigger sounds based on how you move around in a scene automatically – something that usually requires a lot of work to recreate manually. \nValve believes that the SDK will find use not just in games, but also in VR experiences. Steam Audio supports Windows , MacOS, SteamOS, Linux and Android , and works with Unity; integration with Unreal Engine 4, FMOD Studio and WWise are in the works.
