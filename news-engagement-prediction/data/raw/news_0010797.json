Rebilas, USA TODAY Sports) \nHOUSTON – The New England Patriots started discussing ways to celebrate their dramatic Super Bowl LI triumph in style almost as soon as they left the field at NRG Stadium after sinking the Atlanta Falcons in overtime. \nThere were big plans, talk of expensive shots, fancy clubs, off-season trips, a bottle of scotch being passed around, and then owner Robert Kraft started handing out Cuban cigars. \nBut perhaps the most dramatic part of the early festivities was decidedly low-budget, as defensive end Chris Long busted out several bottles of cheap champagne and handed them out for the defensive line to spray each other and surrounding staffers and members of the media. \n“I got them from Walgreens,” Long said. “For a while there during the game I was thinking maybe I shouldn’t have gotten it. Now I’m glad I did.” \nMORE SUPER BOWL: Tom Brady suspects Super Bowl jersey was stolen after game \nThe drink of choice was Andre champagne, which sits at the cheaper end of the spectrum compared to the choices the Patriots were likely presented with at their lavish team party later. \n“There is going to be a big party,” Patrick Chung said. “The way I feel right now, it could last for a week. That is the best part, you get to celebrate with all your brothers and your family.” Chung was one of several players to enjoy a swig from a bottle of Battle Cry whiskey that was being passed around. “It might be a long time before we go to sleep,” he added. \nThe biggest cheer was reserved for the emergence of Kraft, who brought with him a huge cigar box and shared them around. \n“This is a Super Bowl championship cigar,” defensive tackle Alan Branch said. “It feels pretty sweet to get one of these from the owner. That shows the kind of guy he is. If we lose, we lose together. When we win, we all share in it.” PHOTOS: Best of Super Bowl LI Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
