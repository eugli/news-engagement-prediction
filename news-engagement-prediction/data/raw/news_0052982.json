The New York Times writes : \nIn a joint letter, the top civil rights officials from the Justice Department and the Education Department rejected the Obama administration’s position that nondiscrimination laws require schools to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice. \nThat directive, they said, was improperly and arbitrarily devised, “without due regard for the primary role of the states and local school districts in establishing educational policy.” \nRemember what a big deal Trump made of saying \"L-G-B-T-Q\" on several occasions during the campaign—yeah, lot of good that does when you hire homo-hater Jeff Sessions to run your Justice Department. Social conservatives like Tony Perkins are overjoyed with the announcement—it's really important to them to single out queer folks for discrimination, even and especially if they’re students and particularly vulnerable. \nEducation secretary Betsy DeVos reportedly fought Sessions on the matter , but when Sessions went running to Trump to tattle on DeVos, Trump sided with him. Sorry Betsy, at the end of the day, you're still just a woman in a White House rife with misogyny. \nDeVos did, however, issue a separate statement vowing to protect transgender students from bullying and insisted bullying language be included in the guidance. \nMs. DeVos’s unease was evident in a strongly worded statement she released on Wednesday night, in which she said she considered it a “moral obligation” for every school in America to protect all students from discrimination, bullying and harassment. [...] \nShe said she had directed the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights to investigate all claims of such treatment “against those who are most vulnerable in our schools,” but also argued that bathroom access was not a federal matter. [...] \nWhile Wednesday’s order significantly rolls back transgender protections, it does include language stating that schools must protect transgender students from bullying, a provision Ms. DeVos asked for, one person with direct knowledge of the process said. \n“All schools must ensure that students, including L.G.B.T. students, are able to learn and thrive in a safe environment,” the letter said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T13:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:57:36.922+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
