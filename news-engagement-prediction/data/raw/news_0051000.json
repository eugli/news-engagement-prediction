They had come all the way from Chennai after alternate medicinal healers suggested that they give graviola to their relative who suffered from breast cancer . \n\nK M Varadharaj, 70, an agriculture graduate growing organic grape for the past 30 years, and his wife Jaya, 68, a home science graduate, who run the farm say they get at least five such clients a day . Varadharaj first came to know about the graviola plant, also called soursop or mullu seethapalam, when someone suggested it could help cure his throat cancer. After he got cured, Varad haraj and Jaya trekked through Nagercoil's forest ranges in 2010, got a few saplings of the plant with the help of tribal people and began to growing them in their farm. \n\nGraviola, which has its origins in Central and South America, is widely prescribed by alternate medicine practitioners. Scientific studies have found it contains acetogenins, a compound which has chemotherapeutic properties and can kill cancer cells. \n\n\"In 2008, doctors noticed a small patch in my upper jaw which was later diagnosed as throat cancer. I underwent five rounds of chemotherapy and 16 rounds of radiotherapy ,\" recalls Varadharaj. \"It was during this period that one of our long-time customers told us about graviola and even gave us a fruit which he had sourced from Nagercoil,\" said Varadharaj. \"We found so much information about its health benefits,\" he said. \n\nMore than six years later, the couple has 400 trees spread across three acres. They make graviola jam, juice which is sold at `500 for 700 ml, fruits which are sold at `350 per kg and even thick leaves which are sold at `1 each, especially to the poor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T14:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T08:07:54.831+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
