Their constituents will be waiting. At a series of town hall meetings scheduled during the coming recess, members of Congress are expected to encounter pointed questions, blistering protests and, maybe occasionally, small gestures of gratitude for agreeing to appear in the first place. ■ Representative Mark Sanford , Republican of South Carolina, will take questions from constituents in Mount Pleasant, near Charleston. Senator Tim Scott, also a Republican, will join him. The Times correspondent Matt Flegenheimer ( @mattfleg ) will report from the scene. ■ Democrats are vowing strong protests against Representative Tom Reed, a Republican from western New York. Our Facebook Live crew and The Times’s Thomas Kaplan ( @thomaskaplan ) will be there, so check back for updates. Here is what to expect on Saturday: Double billing in South Carolina Mr. Sanford found an unusual partner for his town hall event in Mount Pleasant: a group called Indivisible Charleston, the local chapter of a national organization founded on the stated goal of “resisting the Trump agenda.” The group, organized by former congressional staff members, has helped to galvanize opponents of the president who might otherwise be disinclined to attend town hall meetings with their representatives. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Sanford, whose office worked with Indivisible to plan the event, has been among the most vocal critics of Mr. Trump, having taken issue with the president’s refusal to release his tax returns and his willingness to traffic in misinformation, among other concerns. The event’s other headliner is Mr. Scott, who has, so far, been far less eager to criticize Mr. Trump. A Bronx cheer in upstate New York? Mr. Reed did not have to seek out any protesters. They will surely find him. Organizers from the Indivisible group are also expected to make their presence known at Mr. Reed’s series of town halls, as The Buffalo News reported . Though he represents a district that has been viewed as safely Republican, the congressman, who was a vice chairman on Mr. Trump’s transition team, is likely to face considerable blowback from left-leaning locals who oppose the president. Repeal, replace, repeat By now, Republicans have grown accustomed to voicing their desire to dismantle the Affordable Care Act — a talking point that has lasted several election cycles. But as the effort proceeds in fits and starts in Washington, voters seem to be losing patience. Answering questions about the health care law is perhaps the thorniest task that Republicans face. The reason: They are taking heat from both sides. Defenders of the law often confront lawmakers with wrenching personal stories of the law’s effects and argue that the measure has been a force for good on balance. Opponents, on the other hand, have listened for years as Republicans pledged to turn back the law and are wondering what is taking so long after the party seized the White House to go along with its majorities in both congressional chambers. The tweetable moment Not every town hall has one. But when it arrives, a lawmaker seems to know. Already this year, there have been constituent confrontations that rippled across social media. Perhaps most memorably, Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, was serenaded with chants of “Do your job!” as he strained to quell the anger at a recent forum. Mr. Chaffetz has faced criticism for not seeking aggressive investigations of assorted Trump-related controversies, including possible connections between the president’s orbit and Russian intelligence.
