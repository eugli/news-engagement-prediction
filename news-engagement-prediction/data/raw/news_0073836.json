And how severe can they get? December 1st 2016 3 months ago /video/video.news.com.au/News/ Much of the coast will see rain while southern states will bake in heatwaves. Picture: Bureau of Meteorology Benedict Brook and Debra Killalea news.com.au \nWHAT a difference a day makes. \nOn Sunday, Brisbane sweltered through its 30th in a row day of temperatures higher than 30C. But Queensland has now run out of puff and just couldn’t keep its unprecedented run of hot weather up. \nAfter reaching 31.6C on Sunday, the mercury will struggle to get any higher than 28C on Monday. \nSo who is taking up the heatwave mantle? Well, surprisingly, it’s Tasmania — a state usually known for having anything but hot weather. \nIt’s all part of a roller coaster week of weather which will also see previously parched Sydneysiders reach for the umbrella every day while Adelaideans suffer through consecutive days of 37C. It will be a wet & #stormy week along the NSW/SE QLD coast. While it will be warm over the SW & SE of the country https://t.co/8XTlL4qZJx pic.twitter.com/EXyXcXhNsU — BOM Australia (@BOM_au) February 27, 2017 \nThe Bureau of Meteorology has said the mixed bag of weather was sticking around. \nPhilip Landvogt, a senior forecaster at the Bureau, said South Australia, Tasmania and parts of Victoria would be hot with temperatures in the low to mid 30s while coastal NSW and parts of Queensland will be in for a week of storms and wet. \n“A high pressure system in the Tasman is enhancing the weather systems this week,” Mr Landvogt said. \n“It’s slow moving which means the conditions we are seeing today across the states are likely to hang around for most of the week.” \nNSW AND ACT \nA high pressure system is pushing winds into NSW, bringing lots of moisture and humidity creating stormy and wet conditions. \n“Moist humid air over will bring thunderstorms which will extend from Port Stephens up to south east Queensland, Mr Landvogt said. \n“Evans Head already recorded 108mm from 11pm until 9am this morning.” \nSydney, along with the rest of the NSW coast, can expect a warm and windy week with temperatures ranging from the mid to high 20s and regular showers. \nCanberra will fly below the 30C mark with generally sunny skies and intermittent showers. #Brisbane got to 31.6°C today - the 30th day in a row above 30.0°C! Showers should keep the temp below 30 on Monday. https://t.co/DuxXLlmmpi pic.twitter.com/9CUtAJtpfm — BOM Queensland (@BOM_Qld) February 26, 2017 \nQUEENSLAND \nThe state’s south east will feel the effects of the same weather system smothering NSW. Summer rains and storms will cover Brisbane and the Gold Coast. \nWhile temperatures will stay below 30C for the next few days, by the end of the week Brisbane will be back to its unending summer of plus 30C days. \nGenerally warm days of 30C will be experienced along the state’s coastal strip with showers and storms increasing as the tropical north is reached. \nFurther inland, the rain will recede with sunny days in the mid-thirties. Summertime summertime sum sum summertime, Summertime summertime, sum sum summertime, Summert e! The Jamies 1958. — BOM Tasmania (@BOM_Tas) February 26, 2017 \nTASMANIA \nThese words are uttered rarely, so savour them, “Tasmania, brace for a severe heatwave.” \nWhile a run of 28C doesn’t sound like a lot for those living in warmer states, it signifies heatwave conditions across the Apple Isle. \nThe definition of a heatwave is a run of days above the average maximum temperature for that time of year. In Hobart, in high summer that’s just 22C. \nSo the 28C expected in Hobart midweek and 29C in Launceston by Wednesday could lead to a run on sunblock. \n“These temperatures might not seem hot for people living in places like Longreach which has 40 degree days but it’s hotter than normal for Tasmania,” Mr Landvogt said. In parts of NW Western Australia it is likely to bust through 42C this week. Picture: Bureau of Meteorology Source: Supplied \nSOUTH AUSTRALIA AND VICTORIA \nThe southern mainland states will be the places where the real heat will be felt with a run of consecutive days of 37C or more in Adelaide. By midweek, the city will be sunny, clear and scorching. \nMelbourne won’t be quite as blistering but the Victorian capital is still in for a run of plus 30C days and blue and sunny skies. \nThe further inland you get, the hotter it’s going to be with forecast highs of 35C in Wodonga on Thursday and 37C in Mildura on Wednesday. \n“We do get warm temperatures though autumn and warmer ocean temperatures as well so it’s not that uncommon,” said Mr Landvogt. \nWESTERN AUSTRALIA \nPerth also faces a sultry week. Monday will be the mildest and even then the high will surpass 30C. A sunny week will increase in heat to a maximum of 36C on Wednesday. \nIn the state’s north west, around Karratha and Exmouth, expect highs in the low 40s by the time the week is out. \nNORTHERN TERRITORY \nIt’s the Wet. So it’s wet. And hot. \nWHAT ABOUT THE REST OF AUTUMN? \nThe weather may be all over the shop now but the forecast is for a warm autumn not much different from summer . The main culprit is the lack of the La Nina system that usually brings wetter weather from the Pacific. \nThe eastern seaboard will generally be drier than usual but Western Australia is likely to be wetter, in parts even exceeding average rainfall in some areas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T09:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T04:55:35.792+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
