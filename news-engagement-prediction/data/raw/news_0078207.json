Ministers from countries forming the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) and global thought leaders addressed the Philippine Senate today as they presented new research indicating development by emerging economies would be optimized if global teperature increase was below 1.5C degrees celsius.

The ratification will be transmitted by the Office of the President to the Office of Senator Loren Legarda for the Senate to concur in its ratification,” a highly-placed source told the Inquirer. \nThe signed document-called the Instrument of Ratification-will be submitted to the Senate tomorrow (Wednesday) at 2 p.m. Legarda will receive it as chair of the Senate climate change committee.

However, he later agreed to it after his Cabinet members unanimously voted for its ratification. Climate Change Commission \nLast January 31, Duterte himself convened the Climate Change Commission (CCC), a body created by Climate Change Act of 2009. \nDuring the meeting, the President announced that Legarda would serve as the de facto chair of the CCC for being the principal author of the law that created it, a climate expert, and champion of climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. \nSo far, 133 countries of the 197 parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change have ratified the Paris Agreement. The threshold for entry into force was achieved as early as Oct. 5, 2016 and it became an international law on Nov. 4, 2016. \nThe climate deal requires nations to limit temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius, a warming threshold that could significantly reduce the dangerous consequences of climate change. \nThe Philippines ranked sixth in Asia with a share of only 0.31 percent of the world’s total emissions of greenhouse gases, said the Senate Economic Planning Office. \nBy ratifying the Paris Agreement, the Philippines can access the US$100 billion climate financing pledged to be put up by developed countries annually by 2020 for climate mitigation and adaptation. \nRELATED STORIES", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T16:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T16:24:18.351+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
