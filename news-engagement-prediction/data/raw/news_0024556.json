I wanted to give you an injury update ... \n\"Seen a specialist, I have a small leg fracture & need to rest for 3/6 weeks. Good news no surgery or cast required.. \n\"Huge thanks to the crew & good luck to all of the cast. Due to the way the show is filmed I'll still be on until show 4, so tune in. \n\"No horror smash, small training injury which means I can't compete. No terrible break, no cast, just need to rest it.\" \nThe eight-time Olympic medallist was injured during a training session last week, but had said that the \"show must go on\".
