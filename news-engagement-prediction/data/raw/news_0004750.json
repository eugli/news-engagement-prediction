And we were totally having a great time.\" Stevie Nicks Shocks 'School of Rock' Audience With Surprise Performance At the time they recorded \"Rumours,\" newly divorced keyboardist Christine McVie and bass player John McVie were on the outs, and Lindsey Buckingham and Nicks also were breaking up. In addition, drummer Mick Fleetwood was having marital issues. \"Rumours\" co-producer Ken Caillat added that the band \"started throwing champagne in each other's faces and yelling at each other,\" and that fights broke out in response to the song lyrics, which they all wrote about each other. Nicks, however, insisted that the band thrived on the turmoil. \"It was not awful at all, it was fantastic!\" she gushed. \"We were rich, we were young, we were falling out of love with each other, but, hey ... there was a lot of other men and women in the world, and we were all moving on. ... So as bad as it was, it was still great.\" \"Rumours,\" which featured songs including \"Go Your Own Way,\" \"Dreams,\" \"Don't Stop\" and \"You Make Loving Fun,\" topped the Billboard album chart and won the Grammy for album of the year. It's sold more than 45 million copies worldwide. 0 Shares", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T20:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T15:57:34.402+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
