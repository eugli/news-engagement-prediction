What I mean by that is that there are only so many possessions you can have. So if one player ascends to stardom and starts taking up a lot of possessions, naturally there will be a cost on the other players. Such is the case with Isaiah Thomas and Al Horford . \nAfter the Celtics lost to the Raptors last week, Gary Washburn of the Boston Globe wrote the following: \nWhat was even more demoralizing was the performance or inactivity of maximum-contract power forward Al Horford, who attempted five field goals in 30 minutes and finished with 8 points and five rebounds. On a night when the Raptors were squeezing Isaiah Thomas like a lemon, sending three defenders at him or inviting him to penetrate only to be gobbled up by two big men, Horford was rather passive. \nSo it’s about time the offense begins to feature him as defenses continue to blitz Thomas, who was 6-for-17 shooting and 1-for-6 with just 4 points in the fourth period. \nHorford took one shot in the final period, making a short jumper, but pulling down no rebounds. Horford is a flow player, meaning he won’t put his imprint on the game unless his teammates get him involved. He needs to get involved in games earlier, get some easy buckets and make defenses shift, thus opening opportunities for Thomas \n“Definitely, we’ve got to [get Horford more involved] and that’s my job,” Thomas said. “I’ll do a better job of getting him the ball Sunday [against Detroit] and making sure he’s in the flow of the game and not just defensively, but offensively as well. \n“We’ve got to get him the ball. He’s a key factor what we do and our success.” \nWhen asked if he needs more than five shot attempts, Horford said, “I think so. I think the way they were playing us, they definitely made it hard for me to get any looks. But yeah, there’s no question.” \nHorford’s usage is only slightly down this season, at 20.3 percent of possessions used from 20.6. But interestingly, the gap is much larger when he shares the floor with Thomas.
