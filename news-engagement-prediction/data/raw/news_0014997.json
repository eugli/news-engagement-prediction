Key points: Federal Government promised nearly $300 million for ice treatment and programs in 2015 Concerns that little of that money is actually reaching frontline services Banyan House in Darwin could have to close beds if more funding doesn't become available soon \nBanyan House is one of just a few drug rehabilitation centres in the Northern Territory and is struggling with a growing influx of addicts. \n\"Not one cent, nothing has come to Banyan House as yet,\" chief executive Chris Frank told 7.30. \nAdmissions for ice addiction have surged 125 per cent in the past year. \n\"We're running out of space, we're running out of resources, we're running out of money,\" Mr Frank said. \n\"I'll probably have to start closing beds in the near future if we don't get funds to continue.\" \n7.30 met three people counting on Banyan House to help them break their ice addiction. Do you know more about this story? Email 'Things got pretty hectic' \nMark came to rehab straight from prison. \nAfter losing his leg in a workplace accident he found himself sitting at home in a quiet Northern Territory town, without a job or a leg and with nothing to do. \n\"I had a high position in the cranes for a long time and I went from that to disabled,\" he said, rolling a cigarette in the smoker's courtyard at Banyan House. \nMark burned through much of his $600,000 insurance payout over the next two years as his ice addiction grew. \n\"I used a couple hundred grand positively. And the rest? God knows,\" he said. \n\"I'm pretty mad at myself now for that.\" \nA few months of \"running amok\" on ice landed him in trouble. \n\"You don't realise you have a problem until you're in jail,\" Mark said. \n\"That gives you plenty of time to think about it.\" 'Most people use to escape their demons' Photo: Asher hopes her time at Banyan House will mean she can spend more time with her son. (ABC News: Nadia Daly) \nFor young mother Asher, ice was the \"perfect\" drug that gave her the confidence to pursue her dreams and escape her demons. \n\"It kept me skinny, it kept me confident and it kept me emotionally balanced so I wasn't affected by my life and situation,\" she said. \nA lifetime of substance abuse began as a way to cope with a difficult childhood and an abusive alcoholic mother. \n\"Sometimes I was kicked out, sometimes I'd run away,\" Asher said. \n\"And more or less being on the streets a lot of my youth, drugs just come into play with that. I used to self-medicate with drugs.\" \nBut the initial feelings of euphoria on ice were soon replaced by paranoia, weeks of staying awake with little food and water, avoiding other people and simply waiting for the next hit. \n\"Before you know it you've lost such a large portion of time and that's where the regret hits you. You think: Jesus, what have I done with my life?\" Asher said. \nEventually she found herself in prison and her young baby was taken from her by child welfare services. \n\"I think about him all the time, every second of every day,\" she said. \nAsher's focus now is to recover so she can get her baby boy back and give him the good childhood she did not have. 'It's all or nothing' Photo: Brendan says with ice, it's all or nothing. (ABC News: Nadia Daly) \nThe newest resident to check into Banyan House rehab, Brendan, said there was no middle ground with ice. \n\"You hear of people talking about moderation and all the rest of it. I don't think it's that simple: it's all or nothing,\" he told 7.30. \nUnlike the others, he said he had a good childhood. \n\"I had a great upbringing. I got great parents, great mates, can't complain,\" he said. \nBrendan's been on ice for four years and it is not his first attempt to detox. \nTwo years ago when things were \"getting real out of control\", staying awake for seven days at a time, Brendan flew himself to a resort in Bali and did not touch the drug for a week. \n\"But when the plane landed, I didn't even drop my bags off, I just went and scored,\" he said. \nHe described himself as a functioning addict, doing large amounts of the drug daily while holding down a job. \n\"I was able to pay my bills. But each day I was probably going down the shit chute a little bit more. And that's why I'm here today,\" he said. \nBrendan is determined to get clean and recover but, like many, is worried about relapsing when he checks out from rehab.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T14:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T10:27:40.785+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
