(Instagram) Ally Marotti 's pregnancy photos could deliver for the maternity photo business\nOf the roughly 9 million likes Beyonce's pregnancy announcement has received on Instagram , there are few that like the picture more than those in the maternity photography business. \nPeople around the country (and probably world) took a hiatus from the headline-dominating political arguments Wednesday when they heard the news, announced via Instagram: Beyonce and Jay Z are having twins, making daughter Blue Ivy Carter an older sister times two. \nThen on Thursday, the \"Formation\" singer unleashed the mother load: A whole album of maternity photos, titled \"I have three hearts.\" She was underwater in some, nude in others, on top of a flower-covered car in one, and a few featured Blue Ivy. \nWith her worldwide trendsetting powers, Queen Bey has the ability to awaken a whole new crowd to the pregnancy photo industry with one post. But that power could quickly turn sour if it causes moms-to-be to set their expectations too high, and leave maternity photographers with the task of explaining artistic differences. \n\"I wouldn't be surprised if it did drive business,\" said Shalimar Beekman, owner of newborn and maternity-focused Shalimar B Photography in the Ravenswood neighborhood. \"I think a lot of people don't think about maternity photos. \n\"Maybe some people will think, 'Oh hey, now this is a thing. I should be doing this.'\" \nBlue Ivy is about to become a big sister — twice over. Beyonce and Jay Z announced Wednesday on Instagram that the superstar singer is pregnant with twins.\n\"We have been blessed two times over. We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two,\" said a statement signed \"The Carters,\"... \nBlue Ivy is about to become a big sister — twice over. \nBeyonce and Jay Z announced Wednesday on Instagram that the superstar singer is pregnant with twins. \n\"We have been blessed two times over. We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two,\" said a statement signed \"The Carters,\"... (Tribune news services) \nBeekman has seen it before. In 2011, singer Pink posed with her husband Carey Hart and daughter Willow Sage Hart in a photo that landed on the cover of People magazine. \"Those types of things help with business,\" said Beekman, who charges $185 for a photo shoot. \nSocial media has helped propel the industry into trendiness, said Jesus Sanchez, managing director of his wife's maternity and newborn-focused Sandra Sanchez Photography, in Chicago's Fulton River District. A decade ago, maternity photos just sat in an album or frame at home, for only visitors to see. \n\"Now you do a post like Beyonce and 18 million people see it the next day,\" he said. \nMaternity photographer Sri Iyer said he's gotten requests to take photos that resemble those supermodels Heidi Klum and Cindy Crawford or celebrity Khloe Kardashian posted when they were pregnant. \nManaging expectations after a high-profile maternity shot is released becomes an important part of the job, said Iyer, who owns Sri and Jana Photography in the Pilsen neighborhood with his wife, Jana. \n\"(I tell clients) it's Khloe Kardashian, but there's a lot of Photoshop that has gone into it,\" he said. \"Why do you want to be Khloe or why do you want to be Beyonce? You're you. You can be inspired by them, but you're still you.\" \nTwitter @AllyMarotti", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:47:43.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
