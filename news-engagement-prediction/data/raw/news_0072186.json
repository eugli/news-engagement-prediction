That is what the Democratic Party has always been about and that is what we will continue to be about\", Mr Perez told party delegates. \nHe said that while the 20 January inauguration of Mr Trump \"was an undeniably important day\", the mass protests that followed were \"far more important for America\". \nNevertheless he acknowledged that the Democratic party was \"suffering from a crisis of confidence, a crisis of relevance\". Image copyright Twitter \nMr Perez defeated Keith Ellison, a US representative from Minnesota, in a 235-200 second round vote. \nMr Ellison, the first Muslim elected to the US Congress, was backed by Senator Bernie Sanders. \nHe was swiftly made deputy chairman and urged party members to unite behind Mr Perez. 'Pressure to perform starts now': Analysis by BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher \nIt was billed as a proxy battle between progressives and moderates in the Democratic Party. The political revolutionaries who supported Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primaries largely lined up behind Congressman Keith Ellison. \nThe establishment insiders who backed Hillary Clinton favoured former Labour Secretary Tom Perez. \nThere were even some fireworks reminiscent of that recently concluded nomination fight, with prominent voices on both sides threatening to leave the party if the opposition won. \nIn the end the establishment-backed candidate prevailed again. Image copyright Reuters \nDespite the drama, the Democratic committee chair is more behind-the-scenes organiser than ideological figurehead. With the party still stinging from its presidential defeat and extended drubbing at the state level in much of the US, Mr Perez faces a long, arduous job largely out of the spotlight. \nHe must kick-start the party's fund-raising and recruit competent candidates for the 2018 midterm elections. He also has to lay the groundwork for the 2020 presidential nomination contest, which seems certain to be as contentious as it is wide-open. \nIf he succeeds, the winning candidates will receive the credit. If he fails, the axe will fall quickly on his neck. The stakes are high for Democrats, and the pressure on Perez to perform starts now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T05:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:02:21.916+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
