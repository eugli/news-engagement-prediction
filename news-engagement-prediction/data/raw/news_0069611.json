Announcing this in the course of his customary policy address to the Assembly on Thursday, Governor P. Sathasivam said the register, to be kept in the public domain, would contain all identification details of sex offenders. Interim relief would be provided to the survivors of sex crimes, children and adults, from the proposed relief fund. \nThe government, he said, would soon come out with a comprehensive law covering citizens’ charter, transparency, accountability and social audit, the core of which would be public service delivery. Massive reforms would be initiated to put the State on top in ‘ease of doing business'. Kerala would stick to the Five Year Plan mode. In another first for the State, the government proposed to come up with an export policy to boost the State’s export potential. \nA fast track system for clearing investment proposals would be put in place. Projects with an estimated outlay of ₹10,000 crore would be cleared by the newly formed Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board by next month. In the tourism sector, the government would soon introduce ‘Safety App’ for tourists. Each of the five cities in the State would get metropolitan transport authority to ensure transport operations under a single command. \nTerming the demonetisation of high-value currency notes one of the most devastating catastrophes in India’s financial history, Mr. Sathasivam told the Assembly that heart-tending stories were coming in from various parts of the State on how farmers had to dump their crops, and small and marginal business and households had to give away at throwaway prices inventories built up over time. \nThe Governor was greeted by Opposition banners alleging ‘mafia rule’ in the State and the slogan ‘no rice, no money, no work, no water, no pension.’ The Opposition leaders termed the policy address a ‘disappointment,’ and a reiteration of what had been stated in last year’s policy address and the last budget of the LDF government.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:35:57.575+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
