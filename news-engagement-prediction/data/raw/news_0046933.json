Maryland's rape statute doesn't explicitly require that, but courts have ruled that it's necessary evidence to show that the victim was forced into having sex. \nAdvocates for sexual assault victims say the change would lead to many fewer cases being dismissed as unfounded by police. \nSen. Delores Kelley, the bill's sponsor, said the resistance requirement puts Maryland at odds with laws in the vast majority of states. \n\"There have been really ridiculous cases,\" where alleged attackers were cleared under the current law, the Baltimore County Democrat said. (Pamela Wood) \nThe second bill would set statewide rules for the preservation of rape kits, the tools used to gather DNA and other physical evidence when someone reports a rape. The bill would require that the kits and other crime scene evidence that prosecutors think will be useful are kept for 20 years and gives victims the right to know how their kits are being handled. \nBaltimore Democratic Sen. Nathaniel McFadden, who was presiding over the Senate, called the rape kits measure \"a wonderful bill.\" \nThe way in which sexual assaults are investigated attracted particular attention in Baltimore County after a Buzzfeed News report showed police there were dismissing an unusually high number of complaints.
