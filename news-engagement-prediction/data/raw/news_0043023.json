External Link: @kymdruitt video-tweet: Fringe parade! #adelaidefringe \nThe 2017 Adelaide Fringe runs until March 19 and is one component in the city's Mad March festival season, which also includes the Adelaide Festival, Adelaide Writer's Week, Womadelaide, and the Clipsal 500. \nIt is the second largest annual arts festival in the world after the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in Scotland. \nAdelaide Fringe Festival director Heather Croall used the opening weekend to announce the State Government had injected $1 million into next year's festival to abolish inside charges for artists selling tickets less than $35. \nArtists currently pay a levy to the festival on their ticket sales, called inside costs. \nThe Government said abolishing that levy would provide an incentive for artists to keep their tickets under $35 and encourage the public to go to more shows. \nThe money would also be used to halve the inside cost for tickets priced above that. \nMs Croall said it would make the festival more affordable for artists, audiences and venues. \n\"It's brilliant news for artists all over the world and Adelaide artists, interstate and international artists who have considered that the Adelaide Fringe is too expensive for them can now come and sign up and do a season,\" she said. \nThe Government said the money would also be used for an interstate marketing campaign targeting other states. \nIt said the 2016 Fringe resulted in gross economic expenditure of about $77 million.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T06:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T01:28:10.455+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
