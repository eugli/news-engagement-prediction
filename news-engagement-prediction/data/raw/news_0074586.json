Liverpool’s Jürgen Klopp: directors, not players, are undermining managers Read more \nHenderson took a kick to the foot at Melwood and, though he has not suffered a fracture, it is severely bruised. The midfielder is not expected to be sidelined for the long term but is rated doubtful for Saturday’s Premier League game against Arsenal, a significant game for both clubs in their pursuit of Champions League qualification. \nEmre Can and Lucas Leiva are in contention to replace Henderson at Leicester, although the Brazilian may again be required in central defence with Dejan Lovren recovering from a knee problem. Daniel Sturridge’s involvement at the King Power Stadium is uncertain, the forward having had a virus last week that forced him to miss training.
