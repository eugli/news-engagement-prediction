SCOTT FELLERS \nScott Fullers took these photos of what is believed to be the start of the Marley's Hill fire, near Summit Rd on the Port Hills, Christchurch, on Monday evening. \n\"Just like any fire, we are working together to determine the cause, but it is definitely not suspicious at this stage.\" \nREAD MORE: \nDetective Inspector Greg Murton backed up Price's comments saying: \"While there has been speculation about the cause of the two fires, no definitive cause for either fire has been established at this time.\" SCOTT FELLERS \nA photo taken minutes later shows how quickly the fire off Summit Rd spread. \n\"Initial enquiries indicate that the Summit Rd fire was reported approximately 90 minutes after the Early Valley Rd fire was reported.\" \nIt is understood the fire in Early Valley started as a result of an electrical fault, but the cause of the Marley's Hill fire remains unknown. \nChristchurch man Scott Fellers was one of the first on the scene of the Summit Rd fire, near Marley's Hill, on Monday evening. \nFellers was ferrying his wife and her mountainbike to the top of Victoria Park when the pair spotted smoke alongside Summit Rd around 7.15pm. \n\"Right before the Sign of the Kiwi we could see smoke from the other fire in the distance, but in front of that there was what looked like a large campfire and some wisps of smoke,\" Fellers said. \nThey pulled over to investigate the smoke, \"as there was no fire trucks or anything around\". \n\"My wife called 111 at that point, and the call taker didn't know about it. It was news to them,\" Fellers said. \nHe said the flames started about 30 metres of the side of the road near the Flying Nun bike track, in the scrub between Summit Rd and the trees. \n\"There was maybe 10 or so cyclists and others that had stopped to see what was going on and we talked to a few of the people and everyone seemed to agree it was a strange place for a fire to start.\" \nAnyone with any information about, or photographs of, the fires is asked to contact police on 03 363 7400 or through . - Stuff Save | Saved Stories Save | Saved Stories Next National story:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T13:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T08:04:28.088+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
