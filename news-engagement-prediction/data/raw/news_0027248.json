The Gamecocks actually led by one late in the second quarter, but the Huskies ended the first half on a 7-0 run and then methodically extended their lead the rest of the way.\nNot only is 100 straight wins a Division I women’s basketball record, it’s also an achievement virtually unparalleled across all of sports. Two of the only longer win streaks came from remote corners of the sports world — 252 victories in a row by the Trinity (Conn.) College men’s squash team from 1998-2012 and 103 victories in a row by the North Carolina women’s soccer program from 1986-1990.\n[ Tourney Pick’em is open! Sign up now | Bracket Big Board ]\nWhile 100 straight victories is a headline-grabbing round number, it only hints at UConn’s unprecedented dominance. Other numbers better reflect the chasm separating the Huskies from the rest of women’s college basketball’s elite programs.\nNinety-eight of UConn’s 100 victories have come by double figures. Seventy-one have come by at least 30 points. Twenty-five have come by 50 or more. Even in nine games against top-five opponents during the streak, the Huskies’ average margin of victory has been 14 points.\nWith a young lineup and more talent on the way, UConn’s 100-game win streak could last awhile. (AP) More Such an extended stretch of excellence has exposed UConn to criticism that it’s too good, that it’s rendering women’s basketball boring and predictable. There’s some truth in that, yet it’s not the Huskies’ fault. They’ve raised the bar. Now it’s up to the rest of the country to try to meet it.\nThis was supposed to be the season when UConn went from untouchable to vulnerable after graduating senior stars Breanna Stewart, Moriah Jefferson and Morgan Tuck . The Huskies instead haven’t missed a beat without the first three picks in the 2016 WNBA draft, cruising to a 25-0 record that includes victories over elite foes Baylor, Notre Dame, Florida State, Texas and now South Carolina.\nSophomores Katie Lou Samuelson and Napheesa Collier have emerged as the next generation of UConn stars, averaging more than 40 points per game between them. Junior guard Kia Nurse has thrived as a defensive stopper, while junior forward Gabby Williams has anchored the frontcourt despite giving up size in many of the Huskies’ most challenging games.\nSouth Carolina appeared to pose an especially formidable challenge for UConn on Monday night because the Gamecocks’ strength is their size. Six-foot-5 A’ja Wilson and 6-4 Alaina Coates average more than 30 points per game between them and often bludgeon opponents on the glass.\nThe 5-foot-11 Williams somehow outplayed both Wilson and Coates, and not just because of her career-high 26 points. She used her quickness and guile to outfight the bigger, stronger South Carolina frontcourt players for 14 rebounds and helped spark a flurry of fast breaks with her disruptive defense.\nUConn needed a career-best performance from Williams on a night when some of its other standouts were misfiring. Samuelson struggled with her shot, Nurse was hampered by an undisclosed injury and Collier had to play through foul trouble.\nWhat’s especially scary for the rest of the country is that UConn may only get better the next several years. The Huskies only have one senior in their starting lineup, they have high-profile transfers Azura Stevens (Duke) and Batouly Camara (Kentucky) on their bench and they have the nation’s top recruit Megan Walker set to arrive next season.\nRead More Earlier this week, Auriemma told reporters that a loss was inevitable — the only question was when. Maybe so, but if someone doesn’t get UConn this season, it could be a long, long time.\nMore on Yahoo Sports:\n• Kevin Love’s injury deals blow to Cavs\n• Source: Magic deal Serge Ibaka\n• In his first interview since sending insensitive tweets, Steve Clevenger says he’s not racist\n• Cubs no longer World Series favorites\n– – – – – – –\nJeff Eisenberg is the editor of The Dagger on Yahoo Sports.
