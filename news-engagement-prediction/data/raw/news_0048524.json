That includes the defence minister. \nAt present, only vice-president Hamid Ansari travels with his wife, Salma Ansari. \nIn terms of protocol, the services chiefs are ex officio officers of cabinet secretary rank and report to the defence minister. \nParrikar is likely to speak to the three service chiefs and the defence secretary before he decides on the spouse travel rule. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T14:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T12:12:40.875+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
