Picture: Daniel Marsh\nMs Bain said at least half a dozen of Australia’s largest and most influential advertising and financial businesses had booked conferences so far this year — catering for hundreds of staff — and more inquiries were coming in on almost a weekly basis.\nShe said this growth had come from “almost nothing” a year ago.\n“The Sydney corporate world seem to love the great outdoors right now,” Ms Bain said.\n“Glamping and camp fires are particularly popular and we have corporate bookings right through to the end of the year.”\nGlenworth Valley Outdoor Adventures will also open a brand new, multi-million dollar conference centre overlooking Popran­ Creek next month as the region’s tourism operators turn their sights on the lucrative conference and convention market­.\nmedia_camera Glenworth Valley Outdoor Adventures has noticed a big increase in corporate ‘glamping’. Picture: Daniel Marsh\nCentral Coast Tourism and its “convention bureau” hosted its annual meet and greet at the Swissotel Sydney last week. It saw 22 local operators, attractions and clubs showcase their wares to the big end of town.\nDestination NSW boss Sandra Chipchase said the conference and convention market was conservatively worth $70 million a year to the Coast’s economy and provided about 1000 fulltime jobs.\n“The regional conference market represents a wealth of opportunity for the NSW visitor economy and I encourage professional conference organisers to consider hosting their next business event on the Central Coast,” Ms Chipchase said.\nCentral Coast Tourism chief executive Robyne Abernethy­ said the region’s peak industry body had identified the conference market as a key growth area.\nmedia_camera ’Glamping’ has become all the rage. Picture: Daniel Marsh\n“This sector is valuable to the local operators as conference and meeting business tends to come midweek and outside of peak seasons, providing year-round business and benefit to the local economy,” she said.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=135086289853833&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fcentral-coast%2Fnews-story%2F492f4a0707f20ae7956ceaccbd53b843&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fcentral-coast%2Fnews-story%2F492f4a0707f20ae7956ceaccbd53b843", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/2b179d3b34a4d5d3a8d23c4a6ddddbab?width=1024", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/8402ea89611befc501110ff1150bb12b?width=650", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/chronicle/ap/latest/assets/img/news-plus.svg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%E2%80%98Glamping%E2%80%99%20next%20big%20thing%20in%20tourism&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fcentral-coast%2Fnews-story%2F492f4a0707f20ae7956ceaccbd53b843", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/8acfe7afedcac085dca6adf905ad07f6?width=650", "http://www.homeimprovementpages.com.au/find_local_tradies", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fcentral-coast%2Fnews-story%2F492f4a0707f20ae7956ceaccbd53b843", "https://s2.wp.com/_static/??-eJytjcEKAjEMRH/IblgU1z2I31K6wbY0aW1Sl/17C64XD56EgQzDmwysxQR2qS0oELseDeu2nyHKAX4BhsK9WsWBAn9gl1mRFdQj9cozFGBcxeVabDOEWjMoUkm9J+AylcydF/BoF6ywBNHd/+WtZZs2DU6MoK3Ovwe+033qRtfxNM3jfJzOl/gC4F5rlQ==", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-metro/templates/components/header/dist/header.css?m=1484889074h", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f82d7dc99ddb5d29509e1a990450363c?width=650", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/spp-api/v1/template?path=components.header.header&exclude-css=false&exclude-js=false&t_product=DailyTelegraph&t_domain=dailytelegraph.com.au&device-channel=desktop&is_front_page=0&show_idaas_login_placeholder=1&v2=1&is_local_news_section=1", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/resource/networksales/exoduscampaigns/campaigns.json?t_product=DailyTelegraph&t_template=s3/networksales-loader/index&td_domain=dailytelegraph.com.au&td_pagetype=articlepage_v2&esi=true&td_channel=desktop&td_section=newslocal/central-coast", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/networksales/loader/latest/assets/js/exodus_loader-client.js"], "published": "2017-02-22T16:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T11:14:08.441+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
