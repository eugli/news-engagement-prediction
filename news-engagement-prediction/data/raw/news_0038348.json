Photo courtesy of the Loop Trolley Company. \nST. LOUIS • A third streetcar for the Loop Trolley arrived in St. Louis Thursday. \nThe car is one of two refurbished 1990s replicas of 1903 streetcars used on the Portland Vintage Trolley service in Portland, Oregon. The second car is expected to arrive in coming weeks. \nThe car was delivered to St. Louis by flatbed truck after it competed weeks of testing in Iowa. It is now housed in the Loop Trolley headquarters on Delmar Boulevard, where it awaits test runs on the tracks. \nThe car's original seating layout was changed, and wheelchair lifts were installed onto each end platform. \nThe Loop Trolley is a 2.2-mile, $51 million trolley running along Delmar Boulevard that will connect the Delmar Loop to Forest Park. Construction of the trolley line is complete but passenger service won't begin until late spring. \nTwo vintage green trolleys from Seattle were shipped to St. Louis in June. A third car from Seattle will be delivered in spring. \nThe cars, which include wood-panel interiors and brass hardware, used to run on the George Benson Waterfront Streetcar Line in Seattle. Together the three Seattle trolleys cost about $200,000 total.
