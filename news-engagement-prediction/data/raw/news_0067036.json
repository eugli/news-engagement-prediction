Honey butter, chicken and biscuit all together? That’s magical. That’s gospel,” said Thomas. \nHis video as of Thursday passed 5 million views on Facebook. \n“Something about that biscuit, it’s the sweetest thing. It’s the best thing I ever ate,” sang Thomas. “You eat one of these and you just start hugging people.” \nThomas recorded the video a few mornings ago after feeling inspired. \n“Makes you think about all the good times in life,” said Thomas. \nWhile Thomas’ pastoring days inside the walls of a church are behind him, he now take his message on the road as a self-proclaimed evangelical comedian. \n“My comedy is built around making people feel better about being who they are, wherever they are,” said Thomas. “If this little piece of inspiration helps them, so be it.” \nWhile Thomas is not getting paid and is merely just a fan, his only mission was a smile. \n“I want people to take away that it’s time to laugh,” said Thomas. “Laughing is healing.” Jeff Paul facebook Follow Reporter Jeff Paul joined the CBS 11 News team in 2014.
