Just hours after confirming the release of a second album in the span of seven days, the Atlanta rapper appeared on the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon for a performance of “Draco,” a cut from his current, seventh album release Future . \nWith his trusted producer and collaborator DJ Esco in support, Future got in his zone without so much as lifting his hoodie. \nFuture is cruising toward a No. 1 debut on the Billboard 200 chart for what would be the artist’s fourth successive bow at the summit, following Evol (2016), What a Time to Be Alive (with Drake ) and DS2 (both in 2015). Not content with all that, he’s just announced a new album, HNDRXX (with DJ Esco on production duties), will drop this later this week and he’ll hit the road for his Nobody Safe Tour this May. \nFuture has teased the official video for “Draco,” which could arrive as early as today. \nWatch the late night performance below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T18:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T13:18:55.599+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
