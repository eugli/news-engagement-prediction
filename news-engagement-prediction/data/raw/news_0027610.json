Former champions collide \nMonday night on RAW, Joe would take part in an interview with Michael Cole in which he discussed his relationship with Triple H, injuring Rollins and where he hopes to go on the main roster. \nJOIN THE DEBATE \nWill Samoa Joe and Sami Zayn clash at Fastlane? Join the debate by becoming a GMS writer HERE: http://gms.to/haveyoursay1 Article continues below \nWhile Joe would reference several superstars in his interview, the one statement that would come back to him on the night, revolved around Sami Zayn. \nClaiming that Sami Zayn is just happy to be on RAW, Joe would go on to express how he is nothing like that. Article continues below Anthony Martial's highlights v Watford prove he's turned a corner under Mourinho \nFollowing a hard fought win over Rusev, Zayn was asked about the comments made by Joe earlier in the show, comments that the Underdog from the Underground had no problems addressing. \nZayn would agree that Joe is nothing like himself as he does not sell out, but half way through his answer, Joe would make an appearance. \nWhile his music started and Zayn focused on the stage, just like with his attack on Rollins, Joe would attack Zayn from his blind spot. \nAttacking him from the side, Joe would go on to completely destroy Zayn in the same brutal style that he has become known for. \nThe two former NXT Champions possibly getting in the ring together is clearly something that the fans want to see - if the reaction to tonight's segment is anything to go by. \nWith Fastlane just three weeks away, this is a match that could very well make it onto the card for that event, it could also extend all the way to WrestleMania in April. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
