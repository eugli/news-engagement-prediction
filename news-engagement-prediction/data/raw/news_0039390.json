(Photo: Steve Mitchell-USA TODAY Sports) \nNick Saban and his Alabama coaching staff may find themselves in an unfamiliar position if they want to recruit a player from Parkway (La.) High School. \nThey won't be allowed on campus. \nIn an interview with 104.5 ESPN in Baton Rouge, Parkway coach David Feaster said that the Crimson Tide coaches are no longer welcomed at the school's campus because they aren't \"ethical.\" \n\"LSU's welcome in my school anytime. The only school that can't come to Parkway is Alabama. And there's a long story behind that, but it had to do with not being ethical in their recruiting. \n\"They can't come. Everyone else is 100 percent welcome.\" \nThe reason was that former LSU quarterback Brandon Harris thought he had an offer from Alabama. It was not, apparently, a committable offer, and the Tide ultimately went in a different direction. According to Feaster, Harris wanted to commit to Alabama. \nHarris recently announced that he is transferring from LSU .
