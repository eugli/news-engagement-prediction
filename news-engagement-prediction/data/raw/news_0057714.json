It is unclear why he requested the review, but its inclusion in Mr Trump's executive order on constructing a wall along the southern border suggests he may use it for leverage in negotiations with Mexico.\nMexican officials are also concerned about Mr Trump's pledge to renegotiate trade partnerships between the two countries.\nThe president has proposed to levy a 20% tax on Mexican imports to pay for a border wall.\nDemocratic senators urged Mr Tillerson and Mr Kelly to work through tensions with their Mexican counterparts on Thursday.\n\"We urge you to use your visit to disavow vitriolic rhetoric and forge a strong partnership based on mutual respect with the government of Mexico,\" the senators wrote in an open letter.", "external_links": ["http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/17229/production/_94816749_25644283-11a0-45c8-8854-cb02f57bfd26.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-23T20:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:20:55.678+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
