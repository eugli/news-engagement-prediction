The controversial ad has been shared and liked more than 500 times, and seen by more than 50,000 people since it was first posted online on Friday. Radio host Neil Mitchell questioned Bec on Tuesday asking her 'isn't Valentine's Day about love rather than possibly getting a weapon for hunting?'. The Swan Hill Fishing and Shooting store (pictured) came under fire for its Valentine's Day advertisement 'The fewer guns in the community the better,' Mr Mitchell said. 'The more guns we've got in the community the more possibility people can pinch them and do bad things with them.' Overwhelming attention prompted Bec to take to Facebook on Tuesday and confront all the 'whingers'. 'Oh my god, can you believe this ad is causing a sh**storm lol [laugh out loud],' she said. 'Get a grip people, nobody is condoning violence. If you truly love your partner, you buy them the ultimate gift. Be it a new car, a sparkly diamond ring, or a gun.' After the debate blew up, she conceded there was 'no point arguing with idiots when it comes to firearm debates'. 'Say your piece and be done,' Bec said. 'Get a grip people, nobody is condoning violence. If you truly love your partner, you buy them the ultimate gift. Be it a new car, a sparkly diamond ring, or a gun,' the store wrote on its Facebook page 'Oh my God, can you believe this ad is causing a sh** storm lol,' the store wrote on Friday 'Might I just add, there is no point arguing with idiots, when it comes to firearm debates,' the store said While Bec said the ad was meant in jest, it triggered hundreds to fire up about its appropriateness. A New Zealand gun supplier shared the ad to its Facebook page on Sunday claiming the store should have used a different turn of phrase. 'Better choice of words maybe?' it said. Christian-based Facebook page 'Christians against social media' also shot out at the inflammatory ad. 'We cannot support thisâ€¦ join us in our boycott,' it said. 'Better choice of words maybe?' a New Zealand based gun supplier wrote alongside the ad 'We cannot support this, we are Christians against social media and this company uses social media. Join us in our boycott of all so evil media today,' the Christian group wrote online 'I'd love a new slug gun for Valentine's, at least I won't get fat from eating too much chocolate, and roses only die,' one user said While the ad was unpopular among some, many were in favour of the pro-gun message. 'Good work guys, firearms as gifts are not an uncommon thing, but apparently common sense and education is,' one man said. 'More gun ads, more aware people, more gun owners, equals more pressure at the polls and a bigger say in our future.' One woman fired up, claiming guns were a more sensible gift than more conventional options. 'I'd love a new slug gun for valentines, at least I won't get fat from eating too much chocolate and roses only die,' she said. 'Some women like diamonds, some would like a nice 9mm block. I've only met women that wanted the diamonds, my house, my cars and the shirt off my back. Maybe I'll go buy myself a new flock just to cheer myself up,' one man said. The gun supply store, which often advertises guns on its Facebook page (pictured), has hit back after debate around its controversial ad blew up 'Some women like diamonds, some would like a nice 9mm block,' one user said in favour of the ad 'Good work guys.
