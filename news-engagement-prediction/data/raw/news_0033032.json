The French champions took full advantage of Barca's poor performance, and in some style. \nFollowing their 4-0 thrashing, Neymar has taken to Instagram to post a brutally honest message regarding their chances of advancing to the next round. \nEx-Real Madrid Galactico Angel Di Maria opened the scoring with a delightful free-kick - albeit a shit wall - before January signing Julian Draxler doubled their lead on the stroke of half-time. \nThe Argentine wizard then bagged his second of the night through an exquisite long-range effort, then one of the most lethal frontmen, Edinson Cavani, completed the rout. \n(Watch as PSG players celebrate Di Maria and Cavani's birthday in the dressing room.) \nThis morning, the Brazilian posted this message; \"While there is a 1% chance, we will have 99% faith .\" A post shared by Nj :flag_br: :ghost: neymarjr (@neymarjr) on Feb 15, 2017 at 4:00am PST \nThe Catalans will need to produce one of the greatest Champions League comebacks if they have any aspirations of maintaining in this years competition. \nIt'll test the resolve of not just the Barca players but also Luis Enrique who faces one of his biggest challenges in his short managerial career. \nWho takes the second leg?
