The project will acquire 60,000 square feet of space. The taller building will be 200 meters high! \nIt will have offices, museum, a green architectural school, and a private rooftop club.

While the other building will be 108 meters high. \nThe plantations are assumed to produce 132 pounds of oxygen a day. It will reuse the filtered 'gray water' from the building for plant irrigation purposes. The architect of this unbelievable entity is Milan-based. \nHe sowed the seed of the green venture idea in his hometown itself, for which he won 'The International Highrise Award' in 2014 and '2015 Best Tall Building Worldwide'. The Bosco Verticale in Milan are the residential green towers. \nThey are 110 and 76 meters high with 11 floors for commercial use.
