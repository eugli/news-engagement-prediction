It’s a two-car trailer.” \nFischbach said the theft happened sometime between 11 p.m. Tuesday and 7 a.m. Wednesday. \nAnyone with information about this crime is asked to call police.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:08:07.332+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
