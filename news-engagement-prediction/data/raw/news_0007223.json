It meant the British Museum once again became the most popular institution, drawing in 6.9 million visitors in 2016.\nTate said that in 2014 Tate Modern hosted its most popular ever exhibition, Matisse Cutouts , which drew in over half a million people. However, 2016 was also a successful year for Tate Modern, with its long-awaited extension, Switch House , drawing in a record-breaking 143,000 visitors on its opening weekend in June. \nThe Museums Association said it was disappointing that the greatest decline in visitor numbers came from educational visits and school groups. There was a 6.9% drop in children under 18 being taken on school trips and participating in workshops and educational activities in the galleries and museums.\nVisitor figures Those under 18 still in formal education also visited galleries and museums less in 2016, with an overall decline of 3.1%. The drop could be attributable to a national education system which was recently found to be “systematically” removing arts and culture from the curriculum. The 2015 Warwick Commission found that the number of arts teachers in school had dropped by 11% since 2010, and that there was a 25% drop in those taking art and other craft-related subjects for GCSE.\nSimilarly art history had been dropped from the A-Level curriculum, although the government was forced to backtrack on this. \nAlistair Brown, a spokesperson for the Museums Association, said: “These figures are clearly disappointing. As schools come under greater pressure, they are finding it harder to devote time to out-of-class activities such as museum visits. Children are increasingly missing out on valuable experiences that bring history, science and culture to life and expose them to new ideas. \n“Last week, the government welcomed the Imagine Nation report that demonstrated the value of cultural learning, but these figures show that they need to do more to help schools and museums work together.”\nFor the National Gallery, the drop in numbers during 2015 was mainly due to being hit by staff strikes over the privatisation of services. The gallery said: “During 2015 the National Gallery was affected by over 100 days of strike action, and this resulted in the cancellation of many school visits and education-related programmes. This had an inevitable impact on our visitor numbers from both schools and general gallery visitation that year.”\nOverseas visitors continued to make up almost half of the UK’s museum-going crowds. Over 47% of those who visited the government-sponsored institutions were tourists. The museum with the highest proportion of foreign tourists was the Royal Armouries museum, making up 67.5% of all visitors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T00:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T20:14:28.085+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
