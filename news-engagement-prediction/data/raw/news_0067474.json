They’ll play the Pyramid Stage on Saturday, June 24, making up for the forced cancellation of their 2015 slot after Dave Grohl broke his leg (and before his giant throne materialized). The announcement came at the beginning of a live stream for their concert at Cheese and Grain in Frome, England. It follows heavy speculation this week after fans received tickets from a fictional airline with a pyramid-shaped logo, which arrived in Foos-branded slips. A similarly branded website was also launched, with a countdown to the Glastonbury announcement and Frome show. Watch a live stream of the concert below. We're delighted to confirm that @foofighters will headline the Saturday night of this year's Glastonbury Festival, on 24 June. pic.twitter.com/KXWfugv29c — Glastonbury Festival (@GlastoFest) February 24, 2017 Artists In This Story", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T03:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:24:49.748+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
