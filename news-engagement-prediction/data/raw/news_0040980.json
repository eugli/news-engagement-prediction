Photo by David Bergman \nBon Jovi returns to Scottrade Center on Sunday for its first St. Louis stop since the “Because We Can” tour in 2013. This time around, the band is coming with a new album, “This House Is Not for Sale,” which includes the title track along with “Knockout,” “Labor of Love” and “Roller Coaster.” \nIn a group interview, David Bryan (keyboards) and Tico Torres (drummer) talked with members of the media about Bon Jovi’s tour, music and more. \nWhat can we expect from the tour? \nDavid Bryan • It’s about the music. It’s about the band. It’s about guys playing. And as long as we can get technology that enhances that, that doesn’t take away from it, I think that’s what we’ve always managed to do, and I think that’s what we always will do. It’s an enhancement, not a cover-up. \nBon Jovi tours have always had a certain look to them. What’s this tour look like? \nTico Torres • We’re doing a lot more stuff in the round and have some people behind us, as well, which actually we’ve always loved. It’s quite simple, and it’s movable. There’s a lot of motion that goes with the songs. \nHow do you decide what to take out and what to add in compiling the set list? \nDB • It’s funny; we try to change the list every night. There’s certain staples that people expect and probably deserve. We have a big roster to pick from, so depending on the shows, we bring them in and out, which also makes it fresh for us and great for the audiences. We try to do as long a show as possible to fit them all in. \nHow political does the band get onstage? \nTT • We made a conscious decision years ago not to bring that onstage with us. Any way you look at it, you’re gonna piss off half the audience. ... Our political preference is a private thing, in my opinion. \nThe world has changed a lot since the last time you went on tour. What are your thoughts on incorporating current events into the show? \nDB • It has been three years. I don’t know if the world has changed that much in three years, but it definitely changes every day. But for us, those changes are reflected in the records and the songs, and then we go out there. Our job is to be performers and give everybody a great night where they can forget about their problems and the world’s problems, because they’re always going to be there. They were there since the beginning, and they’re going to be there until the end. \nDo you feel pressure to top yourself tour after tour? \nTT • I think we always try to be better than we were in any situation — try to do the best music, the best tour we can. I think if you’re true and you’re feeling good about it, it’ll translate as a good show. The bottom line is we try to play our asses off and have some fun on the stage. So really it’s a big party. \nWhat songs do you especially look forward to playing? \nTT • Two of mine remain “Wanted Dead or Alive” and “Livin’ on a Prayer,” obviously. That has transcended time, and it has hit people in a certain way. If you had to sum up Bon Jovi’s legacy, that song would probably be at the top of the list, and I think because of the optimism. \nDB • It’s kind of hard to say which is your favorite, but those are classic ones that keep going forward. We’re blessed by that. We touch a nerve within our audience, and it definitely transcends time. \nWill the tour include any covers? \nTT • Covers get thrown in left and right. It’s sort of on the spot. We don’t talk about it; we just kind of yell at each other onstage. You never know. It’s whatever we’re in the mood for. \nDB • We’re a bar band, so we know all the bar songs. The set list is a loose guide, and it’s really just about how it feels and how much, how the audience is and how everything is. It’s a live show, and things change. \nDo you feel any pressure to reinvent the live experience? \nDB • I don’t think we feel any pressure or any expectations. I think what we do is, we don’t have to do it; we want to do it. And we love to do it. So I think for us, we’re just going to go out there and pouring our hearts out, and that’s what we’ve always done. \nAs you get older, how does your tour preparation change? \nDB • You just get in shape because you know it’s a long show. We play anywhere around two, 2½ hours, so we’re always in shape, but you’ve got to get yourself in super shape so you can sing that long, play that long and feel strong. \nCan you talk about the difficulty of making an album without Richie Sambora, who left the band in 2013? \nDB • It’s a different thing, but there’s new life, and I think when you have new people you have new energy. We had some wonderful years with Richie, but if he wants to move on in his direction, it’s one of those things that you can’t avoid, and we carry on because the premise of “This House Is Not for Sale” is the roots and the fact we’re still together and strong and love playing music together. \nWhat impact did Sambora’s departure have on the band’s sound? \nDB • At the end of the day it wasn’t our choice. And we decided to carry on. So I think musically, we just came into the studio and said, “Let’s do this one almost more old-school,” where the last couple of records were different. But this one was getting in the studio, looking at each other and hashing it out. We did it at the Avatar (in New York), which used to be the Power Station, where we originally recorded. We made our first record in ’83. And it just felt good to get in there and take these songs and really build them together. \nTT • Just to add on, the three-year period since the last record, the band went through a lot of angst. Richie has been a brother with us for many years — not something you brush off. And of course, time heals all wounds, and music definitely heals everything. \nWhy do you think Bon Jovi isn’t in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? (Frontman Jon Bon Jovi has said he had a falling- out with a higher-up at the Hall of Fame, which has kept the band out.) \nTT • Well, it’s not our decision. I guess when the train goes around and goes around, you eventually get in there. There are a lot of great artists that deserve to be in there that are not in there either. I guess you can only fit so much each year. \nHave you thought about when you’ll stop doing this? \nDB • I’m going to stop when I’m 100. I put a limit on myself. \nTT • When he’s 100, I’ll be 100. So who knows? We’ll see where life takes us. \nWhat’s the biggest challenge the band has had to overcome in the changing music industry while ensuring your level of integrity? \nTT • I think a lot of it is sticking to your guns and not trying to be anything but honest, and still be current sound-wise. ... You have to grow. We’re not going to be doing “Livin’ on a Prayer” and so on. If we stayed there in that genre, we’d probably dry up. It’s not manufactured. It’s what life has given us to write about and what we live and what we think about ourselves as musicians and artists who keep painting the picture. \nHow has the rise of social media changed what the band does? \nTT • We still like making albums. I know the whole media thing has changed, where people just take one song they like and don’t even listen to the rest of the record. We’re still under the premise that an album tells a story, and there’s a lot to be said for that. I think that’s something we still like to keep doing and, hopefully, that will come back in a fast-pace world, because there’s a lot of great musicians out there that have a lot more to say than one song. \nHow does the band maintain that blue-collar aesthetic while still being Bon Jovi? \nTT • You still are who you are. You can never get away from where you grew up and where your roots are. So that’s who we are. We’re a bunch of guys from Jersey who made it. \nBon Jovi formed in 1983. To what do you attribute your enduring popularity? \nDB • For us, we say we’re a current classic. We strive to have new records. We strive to have new songs on the radio. That feels good that we can gain those new fans and still bring out our fans that have been with us for some of the ride or all of the ride. \nWhat Bon Jovi’s “This House Is Not for Sale Tour,” the Former Me • When 7:30 p.m. Sunday • Where Scottrade Center, 1401 Clark Avenue • How much $27.75-$137.75 with limited tickets available at $382.75, $452.75 and $552.75 • More info ticketmaster.com Go!
