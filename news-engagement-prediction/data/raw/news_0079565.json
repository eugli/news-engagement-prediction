(Barry Williams/for New York Daily News) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Monday, February 27, 2017, 11:22 PM \nThe operator of the city’s largest charter school network has come out in support of transgender kids and immigrant students, as new federal policies are fill some local families with fear. \nIn the letter sent to home to families and delivered to staffers Monday, Success Academy network founder Eva Moskowitz urged educators, students and parents to guard against the bullying of transgender students after the Trump administration moved to revoke federal guidelines allowing those kids to use restrooms that correspond to their gender identity. \nMoskowitz wrote the federal changes would not affect policies at her schools allowing transgender kids to use the bathrooms they prefer. \n“It is so important that children feel loved and not ashamed of who they are — both at home and at school,” Moskowitz said in the letter. \n“Please don’t hesitate to reach out to us if we can support you or your child in any way,” the former city councilwoman added. \nCity and state education officials have issued similar letters to school communities in support of transgender kids since the Trump administration on Wednesday revoked the guidelines protecting transgender kids’ rights. \nDespite the federal move, local policies to protect transgender students’ right to use the bathrooms of their choice — such as the ones in New York City — remain intact. \nMoskowitz also wrote that Success Academy would provide assistance to families who are concerned by the Trump administration’s recent changes to immigration policies. \n“If you are worried about how these changes may affect your family, don’t hesitate to reach out to your principal,” the letter said. “We can arrange to obtain legal assistance for you and provide other support.” \nMoskowitz, who has been praised by President Trump and was a rumored pick for U.S. secretary of education, has spoken out in support of Betsy DeVos, the conservative Michigan billionaire who took the nation’s top schools job. \nMoskowitz had drawn criticism for failing to speak out on immigration issues affecting city students amid president Trump’s immigration crackdown and attempt to impose a travel ban on people from seven predominantly Muslim countries. \nCity and state education officials previously issued guidance on those policies, stating the city and state would cooperate with immigration authorities only as mandated by law.
