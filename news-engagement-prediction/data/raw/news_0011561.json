This new breed of club targets professionals by sector, and they are primed for remote and flexible styles of working.\nThey have arrived at a time when even the most established private members’ clubs are running into trouble. Edinburgh’s chapter of the historic Home House , for example, which opened in 2007, later closed citing “actual usage of the club has not been as strong as we had anticipated”.\nWe have spent a lot of time thinking about the how to build the best ecosystem and enhance an entrepreneur’s lifestyle\nJohn Zai \nCritics have pointed to oversupply in the private leisure market. The traditional members’ club customer – a professional with disposable income – can now mingle in a broad range of purpose-built networking spaces without the rigmarole of membership applications and a price tag that regularly exceeds £1,500 per year, plus an initial joining fee. \nTo remain relevant, private members’ clubs have had to diversify their offering and have taken inspiration from another industry: co-working spaces.\nShared office spaces are booming, with freelancers, startups and corporate workers attracted by the flexible and collaborative working environments. In London alone there are approximately 170 larger spaces of 20 desks or more, and while prices vary depending on amenities and location, premium co-working spaces range from £600-£1,000 per month. Members often get much more than just a desk – some spaces have restaurants, access to private events and opportunities to network with like-minded professionals\nRecent members’ club openings, meanwhile, have pushed strongly into business services, Shoreditch House has added SohoWorks spaces, and London’s new Devonshire Club boasts a private library, super high-speed internet and hotdesking areas.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Clubhouse in west London (pictured) is designed to offer something more than just co-working spaces. Photograph: Matt Chung \nBut is this new breed of private members’ club just an impressive co-working space? Or do these places offer ambitious professionals something more?\nHigh levels of service Despite being a space for a community of entrepreneurs to work and collaborate in, Adam Blaskey, founder of The Clubhouse in west London, does not regard it as a co-working space, adding “the concept of a co-working space is really a serviced office under a different name”. \nBlaskey set up The Clubhouse in 2012 after finding the offerings of “cappuccino commerce” (temporary workspace provided by hotel lobbies and coffee shops) weren’t giving the right impression to his property business clients, but found he had no real need for additional office space. It’s a model that’s continued to work well. “The majority of our members are from blue-chip companies and have an office somewhere else. We’re their central London alternative, where they go and meet their clients, work between meetings, and where they can enjoy a high level of service.”\nCoffee shop, home, co-working space … Where’s the most productive place to work?

LIBRARY was set up in 2013 by Ronald Ndoro. “Back then, there really were very few co-working spaces,” he says. LIBRARY is an open-plan club and so is perhaps “not the perfect setting” for confidential business meetings, but works well for remote working.\nNdoro argues there’s a place for both private members’ clubs and co-working spaces. “There’s definitely been an explosion of co-working spaces in the past few years, but I don’t think that negates the need for a social space,” he says. “If anything, it just means there is even more scope for social clubs to scale into the business side.”\nThe numbers are certainly there. The proportion of flexible or remote workers is growing annually – between 2005-15, remote workers grew from 3.4m to 4.2m. But co-working spaces have also recognised the opportunity to create “one-stop shops” for business and pleasure. Last month, for example, Cocoon Networksopened in London. Described as a “business ecosystem”, amenities include a rooftop bar, nutrition centre, gym with shower rooms and personal trainers, and a wellness centre providing massages and other treatments.\n“The new generation of co-working space has an expanded offering that not only helps businesses to grow and expand their networks, but also think about lifestyle and wellbeing in relation to how they perform,” says John Zai, CEO of Cocoon Networks London .\n“Occupants of a co-working space tend to work long hours and some weekends. Collaboration, mentorship and a supportive community is extremely important to them,” he continues. “We have spent a lot of time thinking about the how to build the best ecosystem and enhance an entrepreneur’s lifestyle.”\nSelective membership criteria Some workspace providers, meanwhile, are taking inspiration from members’ clubs in their selective approach to clients. In Manchester, the new XYZ building will have stringent criteria about the kind of businesses operating in the building, with a “near-members” approach. Two floors will also be dedicated to a formal members’ club, which tenants receive preferential rates for. \n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Millie Killeen, business manager of the XYZ building in Manchester. Businesses applying to lease space will be judged on their culture, values and aspirations. \n“We take an extremely hands-on, detailed approach to leasing the commercial space in our buildings,” says Millie Killeen, business manager at XYZ. “We don’t judge companies by their sector, but we do analyse their culture, values and aspirations for the future.”\nCreating a culture that encourages the sharing of ideas has value, but Tom Lewis, founder of Cowork Inc in Bath, believes many work/business spaces exclude interested participants because they are prohibitively expensive. He says he’s found the “secret sauce”, and it’s nothing to do with exclusivity but everything to do with possibilities for collaboration.\n“The way I see it,” he says, “a decent co-working space has soul.” Inspired by early co-working spaces “that were run as co-ops in 2006”, Cowork Inc’s approach is open and affordable. The space has attracted design and tech companies in particular, but all industries and sectors are encouraged to apply. They have 200 members, who pay an average of £100 a month.\n“People build businesses together because of what we call creative collision,” Lewis explains. “[When] you’ve got a copywriter, a web designer, and a rocket scientist [sitting together], they will start to build cool stuff.”\nHe is now seeking to open a new location in Bristol but doesn’t plan on raising prices. “We’re a commercial organisation, but at our heart we’re a community. Some wealthy guys tried to open a co-working space [nearby] recently. It looks smarter than ours and the prices are cheaper but no one’s moved.”\n“We don’t really have teams so there’s not enough of a majority to dominate the culture; [it’s] created by each individual. We’re a sum of all our parts.” That, he says, is the essence of co-working, and what members’ clubs and “lifestyle” co-working spaces simply cannot emulate.\nSign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network here for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T14:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T09:30:19.617+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
