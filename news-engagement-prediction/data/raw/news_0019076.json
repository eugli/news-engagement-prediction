Is Trump's immigration order legal? \n\"I'm so happy,\" the officer said after welcoming Mr Amin to San Francisco International Airport on Wednesday. \n\"Yeah, it feels great. I'm happy to see him. I'm sort of overwhelmed. He's here. It's been a long time.\" \nFor now, Mr Amin will live with Mr Ball and his wife, Giselle Rahn, in Palo Alto, California. Image copyright AP \nMr Amin reportedly went into hiding after receiving death threats from the Taliban for working with American troops. \nHis visa arrived two days after President Donald Trump signed an executive order suspending the US refugee programme and temporarily banning immigration from countries including Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.

Image copyright AP \nThe former Army ranger said Mr Amin had protected him during a mission in one of Afghanistan's most dangerous areas. \nHe said the US government needed to accelerate the often years-long visa process for Afghan interpreters and cultural advisers who live in constant danger. \nMore than 13,000 Afghans and their immediate family members are still waiting for a special immigrant visa for helping American troops, according to the State Department.
