TNN | Updated: Feb 12, 2017, 11.48 AM IST Mushfiqur Rahim scored his second Test century against India (AP Photo) NEW DELHI: Heading into Day 4, India would have hoped to wind up the Bangladesh innings quickly, in order to give them at least five sessions to probably bat again and then take 10 more wickets. But a splendid century by skipper Mushfiqur Rahim , his fifth in Tests, ensured Bangladesh stretched India till the last over of the first session. Ravichandran Ashwin finally picked up the cherished wicket of Mushfiqur to become the quickest to 250 Test wickets and end Bangladesh's innings for 388. Four of Mushfiqur's five centuries have now come outside Bangladesh, but he will probably hold this one closer than the rest, purely in terms of determination. Picking up from his 159 against New Zealand last month, he continued his sublime form, something that will remain key if Bangladesh are to save this Test. India's 299-run lead in the first innings meant that even though they had the option of enforcing the follow-on on Bangladesh, Virat Kohli went against it. Having to bat an over before lunch, India are 1/0. Despite the resistance shown, it wasn't as if Bangladesh began the day well. It took Bhuvneshwar Kumar just four balls to send overnight batsman Mehedi Hasan to a ball that was a fast bowler's delight. Swinging in, the ball swirled in further to send the leg stump cart-wheeling. Taijul Islam, the new batsman, endured a tough time in the middle against the pace and bounce of Ishant Sharma and Umesh Yadav . So did Mushfiqur, who did not lose his nerves despite Mehedi's exit and a shaky Taijul. In fact, he showed confidence in the left-hander and trusted him enough to offer him the strike. After numerous clunky shots, he gloved a ball from Umesh while ducking that didn't rise much. And that was that. Taskin hung around for a while, and it gave Mushfiqur the chance to bring up his second three-figure score against India. Nine down, Mushfiqur went for a sweep but was out caught down the leg side. For the second time straight, India wasted both their reviews. Their first referral, an LBW shout against Taijul was a strange one since the ball clearly seemed to be pitching outside leg. The other one looked stronger - a bouncer to Mushfiqur that seemed to have taken the glove, though the replay cleared that it was the arm guard the ball had kissed. Bangladesh however, got theirs spot on when Taskin referred a caught behind and survived, though Ravindra Jadeja removed him caught at slips soon after. Brief score: India 1/0 and 687/6 decl. lead Bangladesh 388 all out (Mushfiqur Rahim 127; Shakib Al Hasan 82; Umesh Yadav 3/84) by 300 runs  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T13:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T08:56:40.651+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
