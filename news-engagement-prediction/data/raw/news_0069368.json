BRADEN FASTIER / FAIRFAX NZ \nLuca Beihenert, 12, lives on a yacht in the harbour, and takes a dingy, then cycles to Nelson Intermediate School every day. \nEach morning Luca leaves at 7.45am, taking a short dinghy ride across the Nelson Haven. \nOnce he arrives at the marina, Luca unlocks his bike before riding a short distance through the city to school in time for the start of class. \nThe total journey from yacht to school takes less than half an hour, except when Luca decides to visit the skate park near the Trafalgar Centre. \nBorn in New Zealand to German parents, Luca and his older sister Lola have lived their entire lives on the sea, and have experienced unusual holiday destinations like South Georgia and the Sandwich Islands and attended school in the Falkland Islands. \nAt times, Luca said the family had seen more penguins, seals and sea elephants than people. \nWhile in New Zealand, school holidays were usually taken in the waters of Fiordland, Abel Tasman National Park and right up to the Bay of Islands. \nWith their visitor visas set to expire, the Beihenerts will soon depart to French Polynesia, with Luca enrolled with the NZ Correspondence School. \nHe said while he enjoyed his itinerant lifestyle, being constantly on the move took its toll on maintaining friendships. \n\"There's always something to do on the boat so you never get bored. \n\"I like being free and being able to go wherever you want, and you get to see a whole lot of other countries and cultures.\" \nA keen fisherman – and the only meat-eater in his family – Luca said he rarely got sea sick, except the occasional episode on the first few days of an ocean crossing. \nEven after nearly a year in Nelson, Luca said he was yet to miss a day of school due to the location of his home. \n\"There was one day where there was quite a lot of wind, so I waited a little bit and came in later.\" \nWhile he was still unsure what his future goals were, Luca said more travel was likely. \nParents Hans and Eva have lived this life for 20 years, with Kamiros the third vessel to carry the Beihenerts on their ocean odyssey. \nHans said their first vessel was a smaller, damaged boat that was given to them as a doer-upper. \nAfter arriving in NZ, they soon had to upsize with the arrival of Lola, then Luca. \n\"Having children, the boat always needs to be larger,\" said Eva. \nHans and Eva use their own dinghy for their daily routine, however both admit they are more at home on-board the Kamiros. \n\"It's not for everyone and not so easy on the larger seas but the main aspect is that it's quite free,\" Eva said. \n\"The weather is the big chief, but apart from that, it's nice.\" \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T13:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T08:27:36.920+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
