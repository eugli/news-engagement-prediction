Doc Rivers (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 9:24  24 p.m. ET \nClippers head coach Doc Rivers thinks he's too old to be calling DeMarcus Cousins by his nickname. \n\"I'm 55,\" said Rivers, according to ESPN's J.A. Adande . \"It's tough for me to call a grown man 'Boogie.'\" \nTRADE DEADLINE: Winners and losers from a fairly quiet NBA trade deadline \nThat's fair, considering Boogie is not a grown person's name, and saying it in person feels weird and juvenile. But here's the catch: We call Rivers \"Doc,\" and that is not his name. He is also not a doctor. He's told us as such! \nRivers' real name is Glenn, but according to the Los Angeles Times , the only people who called him that were his mother and Pat Riley when he was angry. He got his nickname from former Marquette assistant coach Rick Majerus because Rivers was wearing a Dr. J (Julius Irving) shirt at basketball camp. \nNicknames are fun. Doc is a cooler name than Glenn, and we've grown accustomed to calling him that. \nSo this is ironic, Glenn. If you're not going to call DeMarcus by his nickname, then he should be allowed to call you Glenn, Glenn.
