Foran has joined many of his Kiwi Test teammates. Source: Getty Images \nSpeaking publicly for the first time since his move, Foran appeared briefly on stage at the Warriors’ season launch on Wednesday. \n“It’s been a breath of fresh air really, I needed it,” he said. \n“It’s great to get out of Sydney and get home around extended family and just get back to my roots and be around big love and just start afresh at a new club.” \nThe NRL last week approved Foran’s return, having satisfied the integrity unit he was in a fit and proper state of mind and sorted out his personal life. \nHe will have to undergo final mental health checks before his return and will face off against the Eels in a round six blockbuster at Mt Smart Stadium. \nHe said he had already felt some much-needed love and support from the Warriors players and staff and was relaxed and settled in Auckland. \n“It’s been brilliant, the boys have made me feel welcome from the get-go and I just think all Kiwis are like that,” Foran said. \n“It’s just one big family and it’s no different at the Warriors. I’ve really enjoyed my time so far.” \nReaders seeking support and information about suicide prevention can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14. \nDo you live in Queensland?
