If you look at him today, you wouldn’t think that he went through what he did. We are very proud of all of the positive steps he makes.\nHe has such a happy life now and is always the centre of attention, wherever we go - particularly when we take him to Darley Park every weekend! In October last year, he was pageboy at our wedding, so it is very apt that his story features in a campaign which falls on Valentine’s Day.\n– Rachel William was rescued after being starved by previous owners Credit: RSPCA In January 2016, a man and a woman from Coventry were disqualified from keeping animals for life after they pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to William.\nBirmingham Magistrates’ Court heard that they bought William on impulse after seeing him advertised for sale online, but that they had not done any research on how much to feed a puppy.\nThe court heard that William was being fed one small pouch of puppy food a day - a small fraction of what a growing puppy should be eating.\nLast updated Mon 13 Feb 2017 Animals East Midlands Derby", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:33:31.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
