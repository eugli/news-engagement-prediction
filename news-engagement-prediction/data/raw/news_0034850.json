If Israel and the Palestinians are happy ― I’m happy with the one they like the best.” \nOn Wednesday’s “The Daily Show,” Noah seemed perplexed at Trump’s boneheaded idea of diplomacy. \n“Did this guy just tell us the problem like it was the solution?” he asked. \nThen he realized Trump’s idiocy may be the key to solving a problem that has perplexed smarter, more experienced politicians. \n“I wonder if his plan is to be such a bumbling fool that Israel and Palestine are going to get together in a room and be like, ‘I think we can both agree, this guy’s a fucking moron. We better solve this problem before this guy tries to help out.’” Do you have information you want to share with the Huffington Post? Here’s how.
