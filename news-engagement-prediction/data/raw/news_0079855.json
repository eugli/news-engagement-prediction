I would be stoked. \n“I would feel like I had a difference-maker on defense and we had a quarterback on offense. Now let’s get to work. We got five (selections) in the first 65 picks. Let’s get to work. From my perspective, especially looking at the quarterbacks this year, if they gave up No. 12 and could get Garoppolo, I’d be all over that.” \nThere is no slam-dunk rookie quarterback in this year’s draft class, as most experts agree even probable first-rounders like Clemson’s Deshaun Watson, North Carolina’s Mitch Trubisky and Notre Dame’s DeShone Kizer will not be ready to contribute right away. \nTherein lies the allure of Garoppolo, who looked like a potential NFL star during his brief time filling in for the suspended Tom Brady this season. Garoppolo completed 71.2 percent of his passes for 496 yards and threw for four touchdowns with no interceptions before doing down with an injury midway through his second start. It was a small sample size, but nonetheless an impressive one. \nGaroppolo has one year remaining on his rookie contract and is scheduled to hit free agency in 2018. \nThumbnail photo via Matthew Emmons/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T03:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T13:02:13.858+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
