But since those comments I've had time to think, we are in a different era now. I was doing stuff that Alan Mullery was probably going: 'Oh my f God! What is he doing?' But times change. 'In a lot of ways I like old school stuff in terms of my professionalism with football but with the social media element, I was over there at the beginning (on Twitter) so I understand it and what it means to the players to have a following and to be active on social media. 'My only issue was timing; timing is key to everything about when you out stuff out and I've said that about Arsenal players and been vocal on Manchester United players. It's about timing. Paul Pogba performed some questionable dance moves at the start of the Instagram video Jesse Lingard and team-mate Pogba then proceeded to show off their new 'goal celebration' Paul Pogba (left) and Jesse Lingard were filmed performing their new, unique handshake as part of a goal celebration 'I have spoken to Paul since my comments. He's is a strong guy, very confident in his abilities. I recognised it when he first arrived at Manchester United as a 16 year old. He was different to kids his age. He had an aura about him. 'You could see he sensed he had the chance to be a top, top player and he wasn't going to let it slip. He's someone you could beat down but he will still keep coming back because he's got that confidence, that arrogance, that you need to be a great player.' And Ferdinand believes that Pogba is a player who can develop the mental strength which defines great players which will justify his commercial activities. 'If I think back to my first season at United it was different. I went into a team capable of winning the League but United now are not a team capable of winning the League yet. I went in with experienced players well-conditioned in the United way. Ferdinand won six Premier League titles with Manchester United and the Champions League They won the League that first season I was there but I didn't feel an integral part of the team and I didn't see the best of myself in that season. We won and I did okay but it didn't feel like my title I was just carried there a bit. Paul has not been afforded that grace. 'He's come in with a big price tag, team struggling a little and he's looked at as being the big talisman straight away and it's hard to do that in a new environment completely â€“ it's difficult with all eyes on you as the big money signing. So next season I am excited about Paul Pogba next season because he will be accustomed to his surroundings and hopefully we can see the best of him. When you are bought for that type of money people expect it right now that's the pressure. 'Time will tell with Paul but he's a commercial dream. He smiles all the time, he is happy rain or shine, and he is always animated. Commercially he is just so viable. He's perfect in that sense. And he's got the confidence to pull it off. Then the question is whether he is going to win because people will always say that it's no good being a commercial success if you don't win. Once he becomes a winner at United, he will go up another level.' BT Sport is your home of unmissable live football.
