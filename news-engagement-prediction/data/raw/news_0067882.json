Andrew Neil slaps down Tory peer during migration figures clash ANDREW NEIL slapped down a Conservative peer during a heated clash over the latest migration figures for the United Kingdom. PUBLISHED: 14:25,  50, Thu, Feb 23, 2017 \nThe veteran broadcaster challenged Lord Willetts, a former universities and science minister, on how Britain can cope with a migrant influx the size of “Newcastle” every year. \nNew official figures have shown more migrants came to Britain from the European Union than from all other countries combined for the first time since Britain’s vote for Brexit . \nWhile overall net migration of EU migrants fell slightly to 165,000 in the year to September, net migration of non-EU migrants fell by more than 28,000 to 164,000 after a decline in foreign students, the Office for National Statistics reports. \nDiscussing the figures on BBC Daily Politics , Neil queried: “Here’s a thought. We have a problem in this country David Willetts. BBC Andrew Neil clashed with Lord Willetts over the Tory solution to immigration A lot of people will think that you’ve allowed these huge numbers to come in Andrew Neil \n“Wages for most workers in real terms have barely moved. Their living standards because of tax and other changes, that may have changed but actually the cash you earn before tax has barely moved. \n“Maybe we could get more people to do [low paid] jobs, if they were paid a bit more.” \nLord Willetts replied, suggesting in order to find British-born employees for low paid roles, they’ll “have to pay them more” \nNeil interjected, adding: “The overall picture of this will be net migration is down, but the ONS, says it’s not statistically significant – partly because the way the figures are calculated are very suspect. \n“But take the net 273,000 – over 500,000 are coming into the country and over 200,000 are leaving – a year, that is a equivalent to adding a Newcastle to Britain every year. \n“Many people watching this will think overall immigration is quite a good thing and don’t want to stop it altogether will think, ‘How can we add a Newcastle every year?’” \nThe Tory peer claimed while it’s a “big figure”, the way it is managed has enabled the British economy to grow and has enabled the Government to commit to building new houses to accommodate a larger population. \nNeil concluded: “Politicians have allowed this to happen – from both parties – but the politicians have not built the homes, home ownership amongst young people is at record low levels in modern times, waiting lists for our hospitals. Prime Minister Theresa May on immigration Sun, July 24, 2016 After 6 years as home secretary, New Prime Minister Theresa May is probably best known for her tough stance on immigration. Take a look as what she has to say on the subject.

It has to be said some of these workers are coming in to fill gaps and work. \n“In other news, when you talk about the pressure on the NHS – a lot of them are coming into work in the NHS, and so we’ve got to be better training our own nurses, doctors and not being so dependent on recruitment from abroad.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:08:25.764+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
