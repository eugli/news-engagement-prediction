DAVID BURROUGHS Last updated 13:52, February 24 2017 GRANT MATTHEW \nA little look at beaches in Taranaki, Fitzroy Beach. \nTaranaki might be Lonely Planet's second best region in the world but its black sand foreshore has been snubbed from a list of New Zealand's top 10 beaches. \nInternational travel website TripAdvisor's 2017 Travellers Choice Awards ranks Mt Maunganui as the country's best beach, followed by Piha Beach, Oriental Bay, Ninety Mile Beach and Whangamata Beach. \nNo Taranaki beach made it to the list. GRANT MATTHEW/Fairfax NZ \nFitzroy Beach may be one of the most popular in New Plymouth, but the rest of the world hasn't realised how awesome it is yet. \nLast year, Lonely Planet named Taranaki as the second best region in the world to visit and while Surf Highway 45 was mentioned as one of the reasons for the accolade, the beaches themselves were left out by the travel guide. \nREAD MORE: \nOn Friday, beach goers couldn't figure out how both travel companies could have missed Taranaki glorious beaches.

I've got a little one-and-a-half-year-old and he loves the East End and playing around with the other little kids,\" she said. \nTom Betteridge said the merits of the beaches wasn't something he had really thought about. SIMON O'CONNOR/Fairfax NZ \nWith its calm waters, Ngamotu Beach is perfect for children. \nHe said usually took his kids aged 5 and 7 to the sheltered Ngamotu Beach but had recently started bringing them down to Fitzroy Beach. \n\"They love it, they love the waves, they get into it,\" he said. \nWhile it may have been left off the list of top beaches, the region is no stranger to international attention. GRANT MATTHEW/Fairfax NZ \nAnyone who went to the Opunake Beach Carnival would know how great the beach out there is. \nWhen Lonely Planet recommended Taranaki, it named the controversial-for-some Len Lye Centre as one of two unmissable experiences and labelled it Taranaki's answer to the world famous Guggenheim in New York. \nThe other big attraction was the Pouakai Crossing, which the guide sid was a fresh alternative to the \"overburdened\" Tongariro Crossing. \nPukekura Park, which is the \"Mayfair\" on New Zealand's Monopoly Board, and New Plymouth's \"moderately lively\" shopping and dining scenes were also given special mention as were Womad, TSB Bank Festival of Lights and Puke Ariki. \nIn 2007, British cricketing authority Wisden named Pukekura Park's cricket ground one of the six best in the world and in 2008 New Plymouth was judged the world's most liveable city, 20,001-75,000 by United Nations endorsed organisation Livcom. \nThe awards also named the Coastal Walkway as the world's best environmentally sustainable project for 2008, one of many accolades for the walkway. \nNEW ZEALAND'S BEST BEACHES 1 Mt Maunganui beach, Mount Maunganui 2.
