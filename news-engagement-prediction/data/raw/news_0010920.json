Farm saw 50pc drop in sales in last outbreak \nThe industry has welcomed the proposal, after last year's outbreak impacted growers across the country. \nOne Queensland farm saw a 50 per cent drop in sales, and general manager Clem Hodgman said it took weeks for consumer confidence to be restored. \n\"The national sales across the board, all sales, all supermarkets dropped 30 per cent overnight,\" he said. \n\"One farm had an incident and the whole industry suffered. \n\"It was a catastrophic disaster. \n\"Australia's got a clean, green reputation overseas, so we're already at the forefront of quality fresh food. \n\"Public safety is paramount and anything that the industry can do to protect the public or make Australian food clean and safe is a good thing.\" \nGrowers said the process of preparing ready-to-eat salads was already thorough and expensive, and the cost of adding probiotics would be incidental in the scheme of things.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T07:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:48:07.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
