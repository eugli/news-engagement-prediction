The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the process is not complete, declined to offer specifics.\nGet Todays Headlines in your inbox: Sign The new directives would supersede nearly all of those issued under previous administrations, Kelly said, including measures from President Obama aimed at focusing deportations exclusively on hardened criminals and those with terrorist ties.\n‘‘The surge of immigration at the southern border has overwhelmed federal agencies and resources and has created a significant national security vulnerability to the United States,’’ Kelly stated in the guidelines.\nHe cited a surge of 10,000 to 15,000 additional apprehensions per month at the southern US border between 2015 and 2016.\nAdvertisement\nThe memos do not include measures to activate National Guard troops to help apprehend immigrants in 11 states that had been included in a draft document leaked to reporters Friday. DHS officials said Kelly, whose signature did not appear on that draft document, had never approved such plans.\nThe new procedures would allow authorities to seek expedited deportation proceedings, currently limited to undocumented immigrants who have been in the country for two weeks or fewer, to anyone who has been in the country for up to two years.\nAnother new provision would be to immediately return Mexican immigrants who are apprehended at the border back home pending the outcomes of their deportation hearings, rather than house them on US property, an effort that would save detention space and other resources.\nThe guidelines also aim to deter the arrival of a growing wave of 155,000 unaccompanied minors that have come from Mexico and Central America over the past three years. Under the new policies, their parents in the United States could be prosecuted if they are found to have paid smugglers to bring the children across the border.\n‘‘This memo [is] just breathtaking, the way they really are looking at every part of the entire system,’’ said Marielena Hincapié, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center.\nThe memos leave in place one important directive from the Obama administration: a program called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals that has provided work permits to more than 750,000 immigrants who came to the country illegally as children.\nTrump had promised during his campaign to ‘‘immediately terminate’’ the program, calling it an unconstitutional ‘‘executive amnesty,’’ but he has wavered since then. Last week, he said he would ‘‘show great heart’’ in determining the fate of that program.\nThe memos instruct agency chiefs to begin hiring 10,000 additional ICE agents and 5,000 more for the Border Patrol, which had been included in Trump’s executive actions.\nKelly also said the agency will try to expand partnerships with municipal law enforcement agencies that deputize local police to act as immigration officers for the purposes of enforcement. The program was signed into law by the Clinton administration and grew markedly under President George W. Bush’s tenure. It fell out of favor under the Obama administration.\nCurrently, 32 jurisdictions in 16 states participate in the program, according to Kelly’s memo.\nIn a series of executive actions in January, President Trump announced plans to make good on his campaign promises to build a wall on the border with Mexico and to ramp up enforcement actions against the nation’s estimated 11 million unauthorized immigrants.\nKelly’s memos, which have not been released publicly, are intended as an implementation blueprint for DHS to pursue Trump’s goals.\nA Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman declined to comment on the documents but did not dispute their authenticity.", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2F2017%2F02%2F18%2Fmemos-signed-dhs-secretary-describe-sweeping-new-guidelines-for-deporting-illegal-immigrants%2FJtO4Fy1OkG7Xc3B2eVuICL%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%3Fevent%3Devent25&tHomeland", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2F2017%2F02%2F18%2Fmemos-signed-dhs-secretary-describe-sweeping-new-guidelines-for-deporting-illegal-immigrants%2FJtO4Fy1OkG7Xc3B2eVuICL%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&t=Homeland", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Homeland", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2F2017%2F02%2F18%2Fmemos-signed-dhs-secretary-describe-sweeping-new-guidelines-for-deporting-illegal-immigrants%2FJtO4Fy1OkG7Xc3B2eVuICL%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%26s_campaign%3dsm_gp%26hl=en-US", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2F2017%2F02%2F18%2Fmemos-signed-dhs-secretary-describe-sweeping-new-guidelines-for-deporting-illegal-immigrants%2FJtO4Fy1OkG7Xc3B2eVuICL%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&title=Homeland"], "published": "2017-02-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T10:37:59.266+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
