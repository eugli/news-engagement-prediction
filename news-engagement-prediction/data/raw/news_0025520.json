However, we are still a long way from seeing swarms of mechanical bees pollinating our crops, with some questioning whether it will ever be possible given the number of obstacles still to overcome. \n“This little machine will certainly pollinate, but how many would you need for, say, 1,000 acres?\" asks Trevor Weatherhead, Executive Director of the Australian Honey Bee Industry Council. \"You have your pumpkins and watermelons where the flowers are in under the leaves themselves, and the bees sort of fly in under — I'm not sure how the robots would be able to get in and out.\" \nWhile the technology is still in its nascent stages it shows early promise in helping humanity to overcome one of the biggest threats facing our food resources. Advancements in both drone technology itself as well as GPS tracking would help to automate the system in future and bring us one step closer to food security across the world for decades to come.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T04:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T02:29:36.369+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
