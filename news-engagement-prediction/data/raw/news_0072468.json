She has been visiting John Fowler’s East Side Tattoo Studio in Bethnal Green, east London, for a year. \nEvery month she spends a full day being worked on, at £450 a session. “I want to get the full body suit,” she says. \n“I send ideas to John for what I want, but you can’t really tell what it’s going to look like until you have it done and see it come together. \n“I think another year of work on it will give me good coverage and then I’d like to add in more detail and layers, and have some white on top so it doesn’t look flat.
