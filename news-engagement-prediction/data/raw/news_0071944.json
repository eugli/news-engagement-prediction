Many were laid off between 2000-2007 when manufacturing and auto jobs disappeared. Social planner Ben Earle, with the Durham Workforce Authority, said that his area lost up to 4,000 jobs in the last fifteen years, and the prospects of them coming back are doubtful. He remarked that people left behind are forced into positions \"that are lower pay, contract-based, [and have] lower benefits—if they have benefits at all,\" according to Quartz. © Photo: Pixabay Finland Unveils Universal Basic Income Scheme \nEconomists believe that this new policy can help drive change, from jobs in manufacturing to areas, including finance technology, medical research, and other “knowledge-based” jobs. \nChris Ballard, who is heading the initiative, remarked that \"It’s time [we] start considering some kind of basic income because of the changing nature of work due to automation.\" Some critics believe that officials are using UBI to avoid dealing with other pricey measures that could impact poverty, like raising the minimum wage, while others claim that many social programs will be cut to foot the bill of the initiative. \nIn an 2016 interview with The Guardian Segal defended the proposal, saying, \"This is not something which is in any way, in my view, the precinct of the left,\" but, \"It is in fact the precinct of rational people when looking to encourage work and community engagement and give people a floor beneath which they’re not allowed to fall.\" ...
