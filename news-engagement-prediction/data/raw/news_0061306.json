Protesters said their targets were “brothels and drug dens” run by migrants from elsewhere in Africa. On Monday night‚ 20 foreign-owned shops were looted in Atteridgeville‚ Lotus Gardens and Mamelodi East‚ while residents in Rosettenville‚ south of Joburg‚ burnt down 12 houses. Last night several places were burnt and vehicles looted in Atteridgeville. \nSection 27 said: \"The organisers of the march have claimed the majority of people in South Africa had an issue with so-called foreigners occupying economic space which could be taken up by locals. \n\"We reject this xenophobic‚ shameful and hateful talk. \n\"... We have work colleagues from all over Africa and the world. Today‚ we stand up for them and others who are continuously targeted simply because they were born outside our borders. Hatred and xenophobia has no place in our country.\" Share Tweet SHARE YOUR OPINION If you have an opinion you would like to share on this article, please to the Times LIVE iLIVE team.
