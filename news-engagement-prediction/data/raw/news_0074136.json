Kaye, who often used the annual address to announce new programs or to call on state lawmakers to pass ambitious reforms of the justice system. Judge DiFiore focused instead on nuts-and-bolts management changes she has made over the past year to attack the persistent delays that trouble certain courts in the state’s vast system, especially the busy criminal and civil courts in New York City. “We do not accept delays and deficiencies in the courts as inevitable — not in the Bronx, not in Manhattan, not in Nassau, Suffolk, Erie, Monroe Counties or any other part of our state,” she said, speaking to an audience of judges, district attorneys, lawmakers and public defenders. “Our first responsibility is to fix what’s broken.” That, the chief judge said to some laughter from the audience, included a spherical Art Deco clock above the information desk in the Manhattan Criminal Courts Building that has not worked properly in 20 years. Judge DiFiore said she had noticed on a recent visit to the courthouse that the clock’s four faces showed different times, none correct. She ordered that the clock be repaired. “Not a big deal?” she said. “Actually it is a big deal. It exemplifies the way we view our work and our mission as stewards of justice. We want to do all things, the big things and the little things, to the best of our ability.” The state was sued last year in federal court over delays in the Bronx criminal courts, with public defenders arguing that the system was so slow it “fatally undermined the right to trial” for many people. In the past year, Criminal Court judges who handle the flood of misdemeanor cases in the borough have been ordered to limit adjournments and to schedule three trials every Friday. That has put pressure on defendants and prosecutors to reach agreements, court officials said. The number of pending misdemeanor cases has dropped by a third, to 8,188, over the last year. Similar changes in Manhattan’s courts have resulted in a 20 percent drop in pending misdemeanor cases there. There are plans to adopt the changes in courts in the other boroughs.
