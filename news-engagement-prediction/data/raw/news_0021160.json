Dale was a loving dad to four children (Photo: SWNS) \nAssistant coroner for Grimsby and North Lincolnshire Jane Eatock concluded the death was due to \"misadventure”, the Grimsby Telegraph reported . \nExplaining to relatives gathered at Cleethorpes Town Hall, she said: “In a sense it is an accidental death by putting himself in harm’s way.” \nShe passed her condolences to the relatives and said: “It is tragic to lose some one at such a young age.” \nThe assistant coroner praised rescuers who ran to help Mr Smith after he plunged into the water off Cleethorpes Pier on July 17 last year. \nJoshua had pulled his brother out of the water while Natasha rang 999. Two doormen from a nearby nightspot ran to give first aid. \nThe inquest heard Dale and his brother jumped into the water from a slipway near to the pier in a “skinny dipping” adventure. \nDale had consumed about seven pints of lager during the night out. Dale's family and friends at Cleethorpes beach (Photo: SWNS) \nThe level of alcohol in his system was estimated to be around between two and three times the drink-drive limit. \nThe assistant coroner said: “That impairs your ability to think sensibly and rationally.” \nIn tribute, Joshua described Dale as a loving father to his four children and a hard-working man. \nHe worked a soup production factory as a supervisor, a job he had done for around three years. \nJoshua said: “He liked a drink at the weekend. There was never a dull moment with him. I always looked up to him.” \nHe told the inquest Dale had taught him to swim. \nHe said: “He liked being in and around water. Many years ago he had jumped into water and broke his arm.” \nThe brother said the two of them had been drinking at home before going out to pubs before visiting two nightclubs. Dale's family want others to learn from the tragedy (Photo: SWNS) \nJoshua said Dale had overheard someone talking about “skinny dipping” and he decided to go across the road to the slipway down to the water. \nHe added: “We both got stripped off. Dale dived in and I went in after him. \n“I could not tell how deep it was. It was cold. There were a few people about. It was just for a laugh.” \nHe described how he slipped and ended up belly flopping into the water. \nHe told the inquest the next thing he saw was his brother floating face down. \nNatasha said the tide had not come right in and it was difficult to tell how deep the water was. \nShe told how after watching her boyfriend belly flop, he stood up in the water. \nPC Carol Rayton said ambulance crews arrived quickly but there was nothing paramedics could do to revive Dale.

I hope you take something from that. \n“Credit to the people who came to the rescue and they were helped by passersby and the two doormen and the hospital staff did everything they could. Sadly there was nothing that could be done.” \nShe added: “He was putting himself in a dangerous situation.” \nAfter the hearing Lisa said her children had been her support during the tragedy. \nShe said: “Dale loved his kids. He loved life.” \nShe has told her surviving children never to jump into the water after being out drinking. \nDale’s newborn nephew, born 13 weeks ago, has been named Isaac Dale Robin Dixon in his uncle’s memory. \nThe tragedy on Cleethorpes beach came less than three months after Lisa lost her husband Jeff Smith, who had a heart attack as he headed to Wembley stadium to watch Grimsby Town play.

Stay within the flagged area and listen to the advice of lifeguards. \n“Jumping from piers, cliffs, rocks or other structures into the sea can be very dangerous. The depth of the water can dramatically change with the tide and what was a deep pool at lunchtime might be a shallow puddle by teatime. \n\"You don’t know what hazards may be lurking under the surface until you are hurt or worse.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T22:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T17:50:12.228+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
