Some people were paid too much and others weren’t paid at all.\nThe union says its members are still facing these problems.\n“This situation is completely unacceptable and has caused tremendous anxiety and hardship within the entire federal public service,” said Sharon DeSousa, PSAC Ontario Regional Executive Vice-President in a statement. “No other employer would have been allowed to get away with a situation as detrimental as this without serious repercussions.” \nLast month Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the federal government failed its employees.\n“This government … didn’t pay enough attention to the challenges and the warning signs on the transition we were overseeing.”\n“We are working extremely hard to fix this.”\nIn January, the government said it was struggling with a backlog of about 8,000 cases.\nThe backlog at one point midway through 2016 reached roughly 82,000 cases.\nWith files from The Canadian Press.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:57:27.473+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
