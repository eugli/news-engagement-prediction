Wedding day: Anastasia and Stewart Leslie (Anastasia Leslie) \nDespite getting the all clear after having her left ovary removed and undergoing a course of chemotherapy, Mrs Leslie’s cancer returned a year later. \nAnd, in January this year she was told by medics at the Royal Marsden in West Brompton that treatment was no longer working. \nShe told the Standard: “When they told me it really knocked me back. It’s not something you expect to here. I want to live. \n“When you get the news, all your life dreams come crashing down but the hardest of all was the fact that I will never be able to have children of my own. \n“It's like running into a brick wall at 120mph.\" Young couple: Anastasia and Stewart Leslie with Barley the beagle (Anastasia Leslie) \nMrs Leslie and her husband married in Turkey in September 2015 after he proposed on a ferris wheel in Nottingham. \nShe added: “We were living in Nottingham with Stewart’s parents at the time and we had been to see a film. \n“We have a tradition where we go on a ferris wheel in every city we visit and he was asking me to go on but because of the treatment I was tired and didn’t want to go. \n“He convinced me and on the second lap he was down on one knee, and I said yes. \n\"I didn't expect to be married so soon but it made sense.” Exploring together: Anastasia and Stewart enjoy travelling together (Anastasia Leslie) \nThe couple, who live in Earls Court, with beagle Barley, are now battling to save Mrs Leslie’s life with targeted chemotherapy, available in Germany. \nThe treatment, which pinpoints weak spots in tumours, will cost around £120,000, including travel costs. \nIn a bid to raise the cash Mrs Leslie set up an online gofundme page asking friends and family to ‘buy a day of her life’. \nShe wrote: “Think about if you were told your life is ending, how much would you pay for another 100 years of life, how much is another decade worth to you? \n“How much would you part with for another year of your life? If you could buy one more month or one more day, what would it be worth to you? \n“A day doesn't seem long but when you don't want to die it's the most priceless thing in the world… Read more", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T14:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T12:07:29.825+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
