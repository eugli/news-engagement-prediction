Turns out Li has an 18-year-old son, Yang Yang, whom he has encouraged to use the dolls for satisfying his biological needs. On Yang’s 18 th birthday, Li gifted him one of the dolls so he “could put her to good use when he needs.” This is a bit creepy because Li previously said he treats his dolls like family members, and we don’t have to tell you the implications of bringing his son into the mix. \nBut then you learn there’s a third wrinkle to this story, and now you’re not sure how to feel.
