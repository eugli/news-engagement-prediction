A new Run The Jewels interview, Uncle Murda video for “2016 Rap Up,” live performance of Migos’“Bad & Boujee,” and Common spinning the Wheel Of Freestyle on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon are also listed as some of the most intriguing content of the day. For those thirsty for some authentic, boom-bap Hip Hop, we’ve thrown in a little Artifacts for good measure, as well as Fat Joe and Remy Ma’s new joint, “Heartbreak.” DJ Khaled f.Beyoncé & Jay Z –“Shining” \nBeyonce ´is most likely still basking in the afterglow of (no, not her pregnancy) her Grammy Award wins for Best Urban Contemporary Album ( LEMONADE ) and Best Video (“Formation”) at Sunday night’s (February 12) ceremony. That doesn’t mean there isn’t more work to do. After all of the trophies were given out, DJ Khaled unexpectedly dropped “Shining” featuring not only the Queen Bey, but also her proud husband, Jay Z. The track finds Hov taking several subtle jabs at Drake in as dignified way as possible. The song serves as the first single from Khaled’s forthcoming album, Grateful . Listen above. Snoop Dogg –“legend” \nAt this point, Snoop really needs no introduction. The West Coast vet has been banging out music since first stepping out on the scene with Dr. Dre for 1992’s “Deep Cover.” His latest solo album, Coolaid failed to do much commercially, but it was still a solid, back-to-his-roots type album. The new video for “Legend” comes with a video trailer at the beginning for the documentary Coolaid and offers up some dark, spooky imagery and Snoop’s smooth, signature flow. Run the jewels –“bootleg kev interview” \nRun The Jewels — Killer Mike and El-P — are on top of the world right now. Currently on a massive tour, they’re criss-crossing the country in support of the duo’s most recent album, Run The Jewels 3 . During a brief moment of down time, RTJ sat down with Bootleg Kev for an in-depth conversation about everything from Donald Trump (duh) to Atlanta rap culture. Uncle murda –“2016 Rap Up” \nAlthough he released the single on the last day of 2016, Uncle Murda has finally released a video for “2016 Rap Up,” which finds the G-Unit rapper meticulously combing through all of the year’s major events, especially in the Hip Hop landscape. Directed by Picture Perfect, the video is fairly straightforward and brings his take on last year to life. Migos, metro boomin, lil uzi vert & more –“bad & boujee (live)” \nAs New York Fashion Week kicks off, the infamous Boiler Room has linked up with F Is For, which is described as the “first in a series of worldwide events,” and for its initial trick, rounded up Migos, Metro Boomin, Lil Uzi Vert, Playboi Carti, and more for a live performance. At the 2:55:00 mark, Migos, Metro Boomin, Lil Uzi Vert, Playboi Carti and 21 Savage perform the #1 song in the country, “Bad And Boujee.” Common & black Thought –“wheel of freestyle on fallon” \nCommon was a recent guest on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon to discuss his forthcoming film, John Wick: Chapter 2 . As it often goes, there were plenty of shenanigans to be had, namely the Wheel Of Freestyle game, which put the Chicago Hip Hop vet in the hot seat to drop an impromptu freestyle when the wheel generated a particular word. He was also joined by The Roots’ Black Thought, who gave Common a run for his money. fat joe & remy ma –“Heartbreak” \nAlthough Fat Joe and Remy Ma didn’t take home a Grammy for “All The Way Up,” it’s business as usual for the Hip Hop duo. Their most recent song, “Heartbreak,” comes ahead of their upcoming Plata O Plomo project, which is scheduled for a Friday (February 17) release. artifacts f. big joker & Revalation (ems)- “cause & Effect” \nLegendary Newark, New Jersey Hip Hop group Artifacts — El Da Sensei and Tame One — let loose the New Single “Cause & Effect” and call on fellow Jersey Native Big Joker along with Massachusetts’ wordsmith Revalation (of EMS) to lend their verbal offerings to this melodic LX-produced banger. Scratches come courtesy of DJ Grazzhoppa. lupe fiasco f. Ty Dolla $ign- “dopamine lit (intro)” \nLupe Fiasco’s long awaited new album , DROGAS Light , was released last week, featuring 14 tracks in total, and serves as the follow-up to Tetsuo & Youth. “Dopamine Lit (Intro)” jumpstarts the project with its trap-influenced sound and undeniable energy. Cookin Soul –“Workiz ” \nThe single art and title should be the first indication Cookin Soul’s new track “Workiz ” is in honor of Erykah Badu’s 1997 masterpiece and debut album, Baduizm, which just celebrated its 20th anniversary. The Spanish production duo delivers a soulful rendition of “The Other Side Of The Game,” one of Baduizm’ s highlights (although let’s be honest, they are all standouts). FXXXXY- “Lip service 6” D.
