Another girl is dressed in a pink ballerina tutu, while “Danny the doctor” is “here to save the day”. \nCampaigners Let Toys Be Toys called the marketing campaign “really disappointing and a step backwards”. They tweeted: “Girls are passive princesses while wise, smart, active boys save the day? Very disappointing.”\nLet Toys Be Toys (@LetToysBeToys) Girls are passive princesses while wise, smart, active boys save the day?

At Early Learning Centre our aim is to offer a wide enough range to appeal to the many different tastes and play interests of little ones. We feature both boys and girls playing with many different toys and dressing-up outfits.”\nThe spokesperson pointed to instances of gender-neutral marketing including a photo of a doll’s house featuring a boy and another of a tool belt worn by a girl on the company’s website.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T19:16:49.439+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
