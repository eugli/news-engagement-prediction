According to HelloGiggles, the special screening parties will take place at590 different theaters, and you can find the nearest event to you on the official Be Our Guest page . Given the sheer amount of anticipation surrounding the film's release, getting the chance to not only see the film slightly early, but be treated to exclusive goodies is a major deal. \nFor those lucky enough to nab tickets, the event's perks will include Ariana Grande and John Legend's \"Beauty and the Beast\" music video being shown on the big screen, special footage from the film, and concession stand goodies that will be available for one night only. There will even be some sweet commemorative swag up for grabs. For one hour before the movie plays at 7 p.m. (the movie will premiere at 7 p.m. no matter what time zone you are in), the lucky fans in attendance will be treated with as much excitement as Belle was when Lumière and Mrs. Potts realized the castle finally had a guest again. \nThe whole night sounds downright magical. If Beauty and the Beast is your favorite fairy tale, then you need to don your best ball gown and head out to share in the premiere joy with your fellow fans. Disney has truly put together an unforgettable event to celebrate the movie's release, and you will not want to miss out. Source: GIPHY \nSince so many theaters will be participating in the early screening event, there will be plenty of opportunities for fans to enjoy the special preview night. Aside from the extra perks, just being among the first to see Emma Watson's portrayal of Belle will give you serious bragging rights. Her performance looks like it will be every bit as entrancing as the portrayal of the original Belle fans met in the 1991 animated classic. \nEven if you can't make it to Disney's special preview night, the movie opens nationwide on March 17. It won't have all of the extra perks, but for Disney diehards and romantics, just seeing a live-action Beauty and the Beast is a gift from the movie gods. The wait for the movie's premiere is almost over guys, and if you get those advance tickets, you will get to meet Belle, Beast, and all of your other favorites even faster. \nJust make sure you buy your tickets before the last petal falls — err, I mean before they sell out.
