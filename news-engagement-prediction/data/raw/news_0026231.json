PHOTO: ISPR \nDespite the Monday suicide attack in Lahore that claimed at least 13 lives, army chief General Qamar Bajwa has said Pakistan Army will support hosting of the Pakistan Super League final in the Punjab capital. \nSoon after the attack, social media users were quick to suggest that the blast was meant to derail plans to hold the highly-anticipated final. \nThe second edition of the annual T20 tournament – like the first – is ongoing in the United Arab Emirates due to security concerns, but after the recent military crackdown on extremism, officials were confident enough to pick Gaddafi Stadium to host the final. \nCountry mourns after Taliban attack in Lahore \nHowever, General Bajwa, on a visit to Corps Headquarters in Lahore on Tuesday, said such incidents could not lower our resolve to fight terrorism. \n“Army will extend full support to all concerned for holding the event as scheduled,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) quoted the army chief as saying. \nEarlier PSL chairman Najam Sethi said the league’s finishing game will be held in Lahore if cricket fans and citizens of Pakistan were ready to watch the match without foreign players. \n“Terrorists of all hue and colour, their masters, financiers, planners and abettors including from outside will be hunted across the country, held accountable and responded to. Our gains over the years cannot be reversed,” the army chief said. #COAS visited Lhr.
