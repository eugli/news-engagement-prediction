Enrolments 'overstated by 116' \nThe independent review found student effective enrolment numbers from 2010-16 were over-reported by 116, but there was no evidence of deliberate manipulation. \nIt resulted in the Government providing $815,000 in base funding to the school that it may not have been entitled to. \nMr Close explained the mistake was driven by school staff's incorrect interpretation of the Education Department's enrolment policy and guidelines, and poor record-keeping. \n\"Aurukun school staff who processed student enrolments did not confirm the identity, custody, and age of children,\" he said. Permanent agreement never struck \nThe arrangement between the Government and GGSA has operated since 2009, when a temporary Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed. \nThat memorandum stated a permanent binding agreement would be reached by January 2010, but none was ever signed. \nMr Close also said high staff turnover and loss of institutional memory was to blame for many high-risk issues remaining unresolved. \n\"The MoU did not contain essential elements to allow DET to successfully manage a long-term partnership,\" Mr Close wrote. Report 'puts to rest all slurs' against school \nMr Pearson welcomed the report, saying it gave \"important confirmation that GGSA played no role or had responsibility in these matters\". \n\"[The auditor-general] has given a clean bill of health to the financial and administrative practices of Good to Great Schools Australia's role with the [academy],\" Mr Pearson said in a statement. \n\"GGSA places on record our dismay and concern at the curious release of sections of those previous reports to media, which damaged GGSA's reputation and jeopardised our students' education. \nIn November, Mr Pearson withdrew his organisation's involvement with the school, saying he was unable to negotiate a partnership model with the Government. \nHis organisation still operates schools at Hope Vale and Coen. \nEducation Minister Kate Jones said the Department would implement Mr Close's recommendations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T08:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T04:56:42.279+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
