Now we can gladly say that Hov has officially become the first rapper to join the Songwriters Hall of Fame. \nThe veteran emcee and 21-time Grammy winner “was in a space where, even though he’s had more pop albums than anyone else, because he did it through rap,” it took longer for traditional voters to consider him, said Nile Rodgers, who announced the inductees on CBS This Morning . “It’s massive. He has changed the way that we listen to music. He’s changed the way that we have fun.” \nAdditional inductees for 2017 include Max Martin, Berry Gordy, Babyface, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, and Chicago. \nThe 48th Annual Induction and Awards Dinner will take place June 15 at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in New York City.
