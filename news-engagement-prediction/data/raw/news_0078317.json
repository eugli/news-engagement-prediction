Current account deficit lowest since 1979 \nThe current account deficit - the gap between Australia's earnings from overseas and its payments to foreigners - fell by around two-thirds to $3.9 billion. \nThat is around 0.9 per cent of Australia's GDP and the lowest deficit on that measure since 1979. \nInvestment bank UBS is tipping that Australia's current account will return to surplus in the first quarter this year for the first time since the mid-1970s.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T09:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T06:00:00.314+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
