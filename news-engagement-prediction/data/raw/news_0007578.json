Northeast Edmonton multi-vehicle crash leaves one dead, another in critical condition \nCourt heard Gress, who had two prior convictions for impaired driving and six prior speeding convictions, drove into the back of a Chevrolet Cavalier in the area of 167 Avenue and 59A Street at around 1:30 a.m. The Cavalier spun into the opposite lane, where it collided with a Mitsubishi Lancer. \nRussell House, the passenger of the Cavalier, was thrown from the vehicle and died. The driver was taken to hospital with upper body fractures and a collapsed lung. He remained in hospital for months. \nTwo others were taken to hospital, one with a fractured ankle. The other suffered a broken collarbone and spinal injury. Gress was not injured. \nThe Crown said Thursday what Gress did that night was no different than shooting off a gun in a crowded room. \nREAD MORE: St. Albert man charged with manslaughter after fatal hit-and-run crash \nHouse’s mother broke down and sobbed in court when she heard about the impact of the crash. \nAccording to the agreed statement of facts, Gress was so drunk that night he was cut off by a bartender at a north Edmonton pub. When he left the bar, staff called a cab and went outside to try to stop him from driving. \nWhen the cab showed up, Gress sent it away. Court heard someone stood behind Gress’s vehicle to prevent him from driving and was almost hit when Gress reversed. That’s when bar staff called 911. \nCourt heard Gress drove to another pub where he was also cut off and asked to leave because of his “high intoxication level.” Witnesses saw him drive away so they called 911. \nAfter the collision, Gress drove from the scene and hit a tree before colliding with a wooden fence. He then ran away on foot. Court heard Gress caught a cab home to St. Albert. \nPolice said they used DNA from the vehicle’s airbag to track down Gress, who had his licence suspended in 2016 prior to the collision. Court heart Thursday Gress was under conditions not to drive and not to drink. \nHouse’s uncle Martin Bird said his nephew was heading home from a hockey tournament the night of the crash. He said the past year has been devastating for his entire family. \n“Every day is devastating. You can’t put it into words. I don’t want you to ever experience it. It’s devastating is what it is,” Bird said. \n“He (House) was a joyful man. He was one of the pillars, cornerstones of the family and he is missed every day.” \nBird said he and several other family members came to court Thursday to show support for House, to let him know he wasn’t alone when he died and he’s not alone today. \nVictim impact statements were read in court Thursday. House’s grandmother addressed the court, saying she also sent a message to Alberta Justice. \n“A man that has taken a life and hurt many more people should not walk,” Theresa Bird said. \nEvan Cardinal was one of the people injured in the crash. In a victim impact statement read by his mother, Cardinal said “all I feel is guilt” that he survived and House did not. \nGress broke down and cried during this statement. \nTayler Uganecz, who was injured in the crash, said it has impacted her and her family both physically and emotionally. \n“I’m constantly worried, constantly cautious about everything. It affected my family because they had to be there 24/7 with me for about three to four months to take care of me,” the young woman said. \n“It was emotional. I haven’t seen him before so once I caught a glimpse of him I just wondered why he would throw his life away from drinking and driving and hurting the four people that he did and all their families.” \nUganecz said the crash has affected her plans for post-secondary education because she still lives with back and arm injuries. \n“I hoped to work in the medical field as a nurse but now with my back injuries I’m not allowed to carry heavy objects and be on my feet for long periods of time. I also graduated last year and was hoping to go to post-secondary in September and I have to push that back a year, maybe two, considering when I finish schooling.” \nWiping away tears, Gress read a statement in court. \n“I am not writing this apology letter in anticipation of forgiveness,” he said. “What I have done cannot be undone… I am to blame.” \n“It was a horrible, horrible accident.” \nGress, who has an 11-year-old daughter, said he accepts the consequences and wants to try to do the right thing. \n“To many people, I’m a monster, he said. “I’m a human being.” \nGress told the court his family is not immune to drunk driving. He lost his uncle to an impaired driver and said now his family is suffering all over again. \nNine months before the fatal collision, Gress was released by St. Albert RCMP with the promise to appear on four criminal charges. He was released under the conditions that he abstain from alcohol and keep the peace. It’s not known what charges Gress was facing. \nThe Crown is seeking a sentence of eight to 10 years. \nRussel House pictured with his kids, Jaysel (now 11) and Jadis (now 3).
