At a hearing that took place last month the Ministry of Defence and Blackman’s legal team objected. \nOn Tuesday, three senior judges ruled that two clips that show the marines dragging the injured man across a field and Blackman shooting him in the chest should not be provided to the media. The legal argument leading up to the decision cannot be reported at the moment. \nBut it can now be reported that after viewing three other clips showing some of the build-up to the shooting the judges ruled these could be released. Previously, only stills, audio and a transcript have been allowed to be published. \nThe first clip that will be released shows a group of marines including Blackman watch as an Apache helicopter opens fire with a cannon on the suspected Taliban fighter. \nInitially the marines seem jubilant but then express disgust when they realise the man was not killed outright. They ask why the Apache did not use a Hellfire missile and one says: “Error after error after error.” In the second clip one of the men can heard saying: “Shambles.” The third clip shows some of the marines walking out into the field to inspect the injured man. \nThe footage that the judges refused to be allowed to be published includes a passage in which the marines drag the injured man, the moment Blackman shoots him and what he says afterwards: “Shuffle off this mortal coil, you cunt,” then to his fellow marines: “Obviously this doesn’t go anywhere, fellas … I’ve just broken the Geneva convention.”\nAt the start of the original court martial hearing in 2013, government expert Paul Mott said it was the most potent footage of its kind he had viewed. “I’ve seen nothing that surpasses it in terms of radicalisation potential. It’s exceptionally worrying,” said Mott. “There’s nothing I have seen that … matches its emotional power. It is a gift in propaganda terms.”\nBlackman was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 10 years, which was later reduced to eight years on appeal. He remains in prison and watched Tuesday’s proceedings via a video link. His wife, Claire, was in court.\nThe CCRC has said it had concluded that a number of new issues, including fresh evidence relating to the former marine’s mental state, “raise a real possibility” that the court martial appeal court “will now quash Mr Blackman’s murder conviction”.\nIt is not yet known when the three clips will be released. The judges who made the decision were the lord chief justice, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, Sir Brian Leveson and Lady Justice Hallett.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T12:45:44.968+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
