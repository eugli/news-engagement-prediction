Pictures \nCharley Day, left, and Ice Cube in a scene from \"Fist Fight.\" CONTRIBUTED PHOTO \nVan Robichaux \nBefore his creative muse lured him into film and television, Van Robichaux -- co-writer of the new comedy movie “Fist Fight” -- followed the practical path. \nAfter graduating from Jesuit High School in New Orleans, Robichaux studied engineering at Washington University in St. Louis. Following college, he came home to New Orleans and worked as an engineer. \nBut Robichaux, who grew up in Arabi and the Lakefront, had always loved movies. And he’d thought that working in film or television was something he might be able do. In 2007, a friend from college opened that door for him with news about job openings for a film that was being shot in Austin, Texas. \n“I wanted to try it and see what it was like,” Robichaux said this week from Los Angeles, hours before he attended the red carpet premiere of “Fist Fight.” \nStarring Ice Cube (“Barbershop: The Next Cut,” the “Ride Along” movies) and Charlie Day (“Horrible Bosses,” “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia”), the high school-set “Fist Fight” is the first screenplay written by Robichaux to become a feature film. It opens Friday in wide release. \nIn 2007, Robichaux wasn’t sure if he wanted to be a screenwriter. Given his engineering background, he thought he might do some sort of technical work in film production. And then he took the moviemaking plunge in Austin by accepting a lowly film production job. \n“I was the guy who printed the updated copies of the script every time revisions were done,” he recalled. “I distributed the revised scripts to the heads of all of the departments. If the script changed, the wardrobe people needed to know if the costumes changed, too, and so on.” \nWorking with that script, however, taught the film novice important lessons. \n“I got to see a script evolve during the production of a movie,” Robichaux said. “And I really fell in love with filmmaking. I decided that I wanted to do that.” \nAfter moving from New Orleans to Austin in 2007, Robichaux relocated again in 2008, this time to the longtime mecca of film and television production, Los Angeles. \n“I’ve been here ever since,” he said. \nRobichaux and his screenwriting partner, Evan Susser, built their “Fist Fight” script from the ground up. The film’s producers gave the writers a minimal concept: Two teachers have a fist fight. \n“That was it,” Robichaux said. “That was the idea. And they said, ‘We like this idea. But as you can tell, we need somebody to shape the whole thing. Figure out who the teachers are, why they get into a fight, what the fight looks like and when it takes place.’ ” \nThe storytelling solutions Robichaux and Susser developed include staging the fight on the last day of school. The writers also make that final day at school the semi-official Senior Prank Day. \n“Which goes back to my prankish days in New Orleans, when I was prank-pulling student at Jesuit and Christian Brothers School,” Robichaux said. \nBut \"Fist Fight\" reflects a different reality from the sheltered world of the selective Catholic schools in which Robichaux grew up. \nRobichaux and Susser interviewed public schoolteachers in their research for \"Fist Fight.\" One of those educators is a former Jesuit High School classmate of Robichaux’s, who grew up to teach in the public school system and later joined the faculty at Jesuit. \n“I sat down with him in New Orleans,” Robichaux said. “We talked about the differences between our experiences in high school and what high school is like for kids these days. It was enlightening. The message I got from him, and from other people, is that schools now are really chaotic. A lot of that made it into the movie.” \nRobichaux is understandably thrilled that “Fist Fight” has reached the big screen in such a big way. \n“All along the way, through casting and production, I kept my figures crossed, hoping every step would be executed in a tremendous way,” he said “Luckily, it was. It’s an incredible cast. Ice Cube and Charlie Day and Tracy Morgan and Jillian Bell. They’re all so funny. The director, Richard Keen (“It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia”), did a fantastic job.” \nRobichaux and his frequent collaborator, Susser, met while they were students at Washington University. But they didn’t begin writing together until Robichaux moved to Los Angeles. They’re currently writing the script for “Wedding Crashers 2.” Their other projects include “Sonic the Hedgehog,” an in-development animated feature based on the video game. \n“Evan and I complement each other really well,” Robichaux said. “I bring focus and aggressiveness to the duo. My engineering background gives me a big-picture view of things. And Evan brings a lot of heart and comedy and humanity to everything.” Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T14:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T09:57:08.966+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
