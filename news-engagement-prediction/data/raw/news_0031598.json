(She also won best music video in the pre-show ceremony for her \"Formation\" clip.) And as Adele accepted the record and album of the year prizes, she lavished praise on Beyonce, who could be seen tearing up in the audience, telling her fellow nominee that she wished Beyonce were her mom and that she is \"the artist of my life,\" and that Lemonade \"was just so monumental.\" \nThree artists went into Sunday with eight nominations each: Drake, Rihanna and Kanye West. While Drake won two awards, Rihanna and Kanye West didn't win any of the Grammys for which they were nominated. \nAlso shut out were four-time nominee Justin Bieber, three-time nominees Keith Urban and Miranda Lambert and two-time nominees Ariana Grande and Radiohead. \nDrake, West and Bieber were all expected to skip the ceremony.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T12:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T07:54:23.476+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
