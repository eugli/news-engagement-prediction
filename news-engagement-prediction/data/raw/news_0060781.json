Puran pleaded for his client to be fined and not jailed because Lim was supporting her two children. \nDPP Nurul Izzah Shaharuddin requested for the maximum sentence and urged the judge to consider the seriousness of the offence. \n“Koay is afraid that Lim will repeat the offence on someone else if she is not jailed. \n“She (Koay) could not work as her hand and back were scalded by Lim,” she told the court. \nThe incident happened on Aug 20, 2014, and it was reported that Koay claimed Lim was her adoptive mo­ther and that she was abused regularly. \nShe escaped from their house with the help of a friend and Penang Hospital medical officers lodged a police report when they found the injuries on her right hand, neck and back when she sought medical treatment. \nLim denied the allegations stating that Koay’s injuries were sustained after she slipped while holding a kettle of hot water in their house.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T02:43:56.203+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
