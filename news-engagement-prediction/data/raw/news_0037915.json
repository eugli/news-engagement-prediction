From left, Brad McMurtrey, managing director; Jennifer Steans, chairman; and Joe… more Steve Widoff USAmeriBank quietly celebrated a benchmark on Sunday, when the bank turned 10 years old. Over the past decade, the Clearwater bank has grown to be the largest privately held bank from the 145 nationally that make up the Class of 2007. From left, Brad McMurtrey, managing director; Jennifer Steans, chairman; and Joe… more Steve Widoff Only one other bank established in 2007 and still in existence is larger — Flushing Bank (NASDAQ: FFIC) in Uniondale, New York. USAmeriBank launched just as the first signs of trouble from what became the Great Recession were beginning to emerge, and it outlived others and thrived by staying nimble, revamping business plans, and tapping a loyal shareholder base for capital. It now has $4.15 billion in assets as of Dec. 31, and 29 offices. USAmeriBank has made two acquisitions, buying Liberty Bank in Clearwater in 2008 and Aliant Financial Corp. in Alabama in 2011. It has nearly doubled in size since then through organic growth, said Jennifer Steans , founding director and chairman of the board. The strategy is unlikely to shift. “We’re always looking at different opportunities, but the core DNA or culture within the bank really is organic growth,” Steans said. A new branch that opened in Lakeland was built around that approach. The bank hired Butch Rahman , a veteran Polk County banker, as Polk County area executive. “You find the right banker, build a team around them and have at it in that market. It really fits within our culture,” Steans said. “It’s not to say we wouldn’t do other acquisitions. If the right opportunity came along, we would. But I would say we’re much more an organic growth player.” The bank had smaller ambitions when it launched just three years after the 2004 sale of the former PCB Bancorp Inc. in Largo, a bank that also was backed by Steans and her father, Harrison Steans, former chairman of NBD Illinois Inc., now part of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM). Thomas “Brad” McMurtrey III , who was president of PCB’s Premier Community Bank of Florida when it sold to Colonial Bancgroup, waited out a non-compete agreement before approaching the Steans about starting a new bank. “We were going to be a boutique community bank, maybe have a second branch in three years,” said McMurtrey, now managing director at USAmeriBank . “Six months into it we had the first change in our business plan, which is something the regulators don’t particularly like, but we had about three of those in the first two or three years, because we wanted to be nimble. A lot of things were happening at that point, economic issues and everything else, and we wanted to take advantage of them and try to be smart.” A big change was hiring Joe Chillura , Colonial’s Tampa Bay area market president, and a large team of lenders who came with Chillura, Steans said. “With Brad, it would have been a Pinellas-focused bank. With Joe we expanded to be both sides of the bay,” Steans said. “We would spend every Saturday at the Marriott at the airport in Tampa going through the business plan with Joe to figure out how much capital we needed to bring his team over. That’s when we [decided] we need another $30 million to grow it much more quickly, and that was when we created the thesis that there was not a large, independent community bank on both sides of the bay and there could be a niche for that.” The bank was able to grow quickly because it hired for back-office operations, as well as for sales, she said. “From the regulatory perspective, when you are growing as quickly as we do, you raise a lot of red flags. You have to have solid infrastructure in place and be very good on risk management,” Steans said. “We really were able to do that. We have a great partnership with the regulators. We’re a big believer in no surprises, whether it’s our customer or the regulators. So they got very comfortable with what we were doing.” Remaining privately owned has allowed USAmeriBank to stay focused on the long-term. “We haven’t been capital constrained and haven’t had any reason to go public,” she said. “We have an incredible group of shareholders who have supported our growth.” The bank has raised $157.2 million in capital through 17 capital raises, all fully subscribed, McMurtrey said. As of year-end 2015, the board of directors and local community members owned 52 percent of USAmeriBank, according to a report from Kroll Bond Rating Agency . Financial Investments Corp., managed by Harrison and Jennifer Steans , were the largest shareholders with 32 percent stake. Employees own 16 percent. With a 2.78 percent deposit market share in the Tampa metro area, there’s still plenty of room to grow, Steans said. “I think we’re coming into the sweet spot size, in the $5-, $6-, $7-, $8 billion size,” she said. “We’ve got good infrastructure for our size and a lot of runway to go for the next several years. I think we’re well-positioned to keep doing what we're doing.” Margie Manning is Finance Editor of the Tampa Bay Business Journal. She covers the Money beat.
