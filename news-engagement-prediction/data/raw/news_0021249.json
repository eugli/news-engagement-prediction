Dogs who are stressed tend to lick their lips and yawn, or turn away from stressful objects and situations. Iris Schoberl, lead author of the study published in the journal PLOS One, said: ‘Owners behave differently because they are pessimistic or neurotic, and perhaps dogs read the emotions of their owners and think the world is more dangerous, so are more reactive to it. ‘It looks like people who are pessimistic have dogs which are worse at coping with stress than others.’ The study found that pet owners more prone to anxiety have dogs which ‘mirror’ these traits. Experimenters measured the ability of the animals to cope with perceived threats, as shown by changes in their levels of the stress hormone cortisol The research paper states that dogs are sensitive to their owners’ emotional states, with women in particular having stronger relationships with companion animals. As a result, ‘emotional contagion’ can take place, with someone neurotic who gets a dog able to transform that animal from having a relaxed personality to being more highly strung. THE RESULTS Pet owners more prone to anxiety, who are more pessimistic, have dogs which ‘mirror’ these traits. In an experiment involving 132 owners and their pets, these dogs were less able to cope with perceived threats, as shown by changes in their level of the stress hormone cortisol. Dogs with owners who scored high for neurotisicm in a questionnaire showed less variation in their cortisol levels, a sign of failing to cope with the stressful situations. The same findings apply to dogs with separation anxiety and those whose owners are not sensitive to their needs. This was tested by separating and reuniting dogs from their owners and introducing them to a new room, as well as setting pairs of people and pets challenging tasks like walking over a wire mesh bridge or sitting still on a wobbly podium. The dogs were also exposed to a slightly threatening situation, with a stranger wearing a hood and ski mask approaching them. Dogs with owners who scored high for neurotisicm in a questionnaire showed less variation in their cortisol levels, a sign of failing to cope with the stressful situations. Animals with greater changes in their cortisol levels show they are resilient enough to reduce their own stress. Stress is concerning for dogs, which can pant, slobber and forget their toilet training if they fail to adapt. Anxiety can also cause aggression towards human. Dogs with separation anxiety and those whose owners are not sensitive to their needs also showed less variation in their cortisol levels A study by pet supplement specialist Pettura found dogs are most stressed by fireworks, followed by thunder, a trip to the vet, meeting other dogs and being left alone. Dog behaviour expert Carolyn Menteith said: ‘So often people forget just how much our dogs watch us, study us and learn from us how to behave in different and especially novel situations or encounters. SIGNS OF STRESS Stress is concerning for dogs, which can pant, slobber and forget their toilet training if they fail to adapt.

Dogs are most stressed by fireworks, followed by thunder, a trip to the vet, meeting other dogs and being left alone. ‘The more confidently we approach new situations informs our dog whether that situation is “safe” or “dangerous”, as does past experience.’ Previous research has found that male dogs belonging to female owners are less sociable and relaxed than those belonging to men, with studies also suggesting that women are more likely to have a neurotic personality or become anxious. It is not only neurotic owners which have less emotionally resilient dogs, but those who fail to pay their dogs’ needs enough attention or whose dogs suffer from separation anxiety. The study states that a dog’s own personality, as described in a questionnaire by owners, was not as important as their owner’s in determining how they react to difficult situations. It concludes: ‘In general, relaxed owners are likely to have relaxed and friendly dogs.’ Share or comment on this article 118 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T14:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T09:50:57.641+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
