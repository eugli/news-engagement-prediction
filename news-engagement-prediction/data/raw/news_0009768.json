Most of the 47 injured complained of smoke inhalation. \nThe play area was closed at the time of the fire. \nFire authorities urged builders to follow safety regulations, noting that welding torches were blamed for past blazes. \nThese include a December 2008 warehouse fire in the eastern city of Icheon that claimed eight lives and a shopping mall blaze at a bus terminal in Koyang, north of Seoul, which killed nine and injured 60. - AFP/cy ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T12:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T07:46:03.740+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
