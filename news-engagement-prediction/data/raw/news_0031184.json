(AP) Reprints \nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway ( BRKB ) vastly increased its stake in Apple ( AAPL ) in the fourth quarter while slashing its positions in Wal-Mart ( WMT ) and Verizon ( VZ ), according to a regulatory filing on Tuesday. \nBerkshire boosted its stake in the iPhone maker to 57.4 million shares, up from 15.2 million in the prior quarter. Hedge-fund manager David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital also increased its stake in Apple by 11% to more than 5.8 million shares. \nAfter long steering clear of the industry , Buffett also continued to load up on shares of airlines, adding 23.8 million to his American Airlines ( AAL ) stake, 53.7 million to Delta Air Lines ( DAL ) and 24.4 million to United Airlines ( UAL ) as well as taking a new, 43.2 million-share stake in Southwest Airlines ( LUV ). \nHe cut all but 928 shares worth of his stake in Verizon, and cut his stake in Wal-Mart from about 15 million shares to around 1.4 million shares. \nApple edged up 0.3% late, after setting a new all-time high at the close. Shares dipped in Q4 but jumped early this month as strong iPhone sales last quarter eased some concerns about waning demand. American climbed 1.9% after hours, United edged up 0.6%, Delta gained 1.6% and Southwest rose 1%. Verizon dipped less than 0.1%, as did Wal-Mart. Berkshire's B shares were flat late after closing up 0.7% at 166.95, near a buy point of 167.35. \nBerkshire also took a new, 8 million-share stake in agricultural giant Monsanto ( MON ), which is being bought by Bayer, and a new 167 million-share stake in Sirius XM ( SIRI ). Sirius jumped 3% after the bell, while Monsanto added 0.9%. \nBuffett dissolved his stake in Deere ( DE ), which has struggled as the impact of low crop prices filters through to farmers' spending on equipment. \nMeanwhile, Procter & Gamble ( PG ) spiked 3.6% on a Dow Jones report that activist investor Trian had taken a stake in the consumer-care products giant. \nRELATED: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:13:04.184+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
