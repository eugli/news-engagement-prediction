Levi was nominated for her work composing the delicately riveting and powerfully sparse score for Jackie , director Pablo Larraín’s biopic about former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, which stars Natalie Portman in the leading role. Levi’s nomination was a bit of a surprise—it’s only the second film she’s ever worked on (the first being Jonathan Glazer’s 2014 insidiously creepy Under the Skin , which earned her a BAFTA nomination), and in the long history of the Oscars , only four women ever have been nominated in this category. In fact, Levi is the first woman in two decades to earn a nod, the last being Rachel Portman, who won for her work on Emma back in 1996. Levi, who studied at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama (London’s answer to Juilliard), is a wildly talented and classically trained composer who has put out a string of well-received art pop albums with her band, Micachu and the Shapes, had the London Philharmonic perform one of her orchestral pieces at the Royal Festival Hall, and has been known to make her own instruments. Somewhere along the way she earned a fan in Glazer, who asked her to compose the score for his film starring Scarlett Johansson as a sexy, voracious alien. “Pablo had seen Under the Skin and liked it, and called me up,” said Levi. She was sitting on the sofa in her London home when she found out that she had joined the elite club of female composers with Oscar nominations. “My phone started going off,” said Levi. “I was definitely surprised. It’s quite crazy, innit?” As a Brit, Levi didn’t grow up with a front-row seat to the Kennedy Camelot myth. “I didn’t know very much about it, to be honest,” she said, but she was instantly intrigued when Larraín sent her the script. She got to work quickly, without ever seeing the film’s visuals. “I wrote a lot of the music without even seeing the film,” said Levi. Instead she relied on her own ideas about the character of Jackie Kennedy, and the music of the era. “I just knew about the period of time and the main things that happened to her,” said Levi. “I just got going on [the score] pretty quickly. I looked at a few pictures of her, and thought about the time.” Levi composed the score on the computer in her studio (“I just looked out the window,” she said) and from there it was transferred onto notation software, and then recorded by other musicians. “I didn’t have to do anything, I just sat there and listened,” she said, laughing. The score is a complex mix of silence and strings, punctuated by vibraphones, clarinets, and percussion, inspired by what Levi felt was appropriate music for the era. “I just tried to make stuff that I thought she would be listening to and that she would be into, just hazarding a guess, which I think the whole film is anyway, just hazarding a guess,” said Levi. The film imagines what Jackie was doing and thinking in the wake of her husband’s assassination. “It’s all a bit of a fantasy.” She sent her ideas to Larraín and he quickly incorporated them into the movie. “He didn’t want to get addicted to temp soundtracks, so he used the music quite early on in his process to edit with,” she explained. The result is a seamless integration between film and score, with Levi’s compositions waxing and waning in time with the drama. In a particularly painful portion of the film, where Jackie is staring at herself in the mirror of Air Force One, covered in her husband’s blood, Levi’s soundtrack both heightens and soothes the emotion, perfectly framing the on-screen drama. It’s this beautiful ease that makes Levi such a strong contender for the Academy Award. While the odds—at least the ones set by those same London bookmakers—are that Justin Hurwitz will take home the Oscar for his work on the musical La La Land , don’t count Levi out. Not that Levi has spent much time thinking about winning. “I haven’t even thought about it really,” she said. “I’m just carrying on like normal.” She is planning on attending the awards show, although she hasn’t planned much of her trip yet, “That’s coming up, innit?” Even if Levi doesn’t break the 20-year drought of female composers winning an Oscar, she’s very hopeful for the future. “I know loads of women who write music, so hopefully there will be more pieces of music written by women or whatever gender in film,” said Levi. “I’m sure that will continue. It would be quite unreflective of the world if the only people who were telling stories , making films, and writing music were white males.” In This Story: Oscars", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:01:12.725+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
