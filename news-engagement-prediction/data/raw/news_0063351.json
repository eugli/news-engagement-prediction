Kwid has been true game-changer and volume driver for Renault India, with more than 1,30,000 cars sold so far. \nRenault launched the KWID with a 0.8L engine and in a short span of time introduced the 1.0L MT and Easy R- AMT variants to cater to various customers. \nIn a short span of time, Renault has grown its presence exponentially in India, becoming one of the youngest and fastest growing automotive brands and the number one European brand. Renault grew its market share to 4.5 percent at the end of 2016, achieving a robust three-digit growth over 2015. \nOver the last few years, Renault has focused on establishing a strong base in India. Together with a strong product offensive strategy led by Kwid, Renault has been continuously undertaking strategic measures across all key business dimensions, ranging from product, network expansion, pioneering customer oriented activities and several innovative marketing initiatives to ensure unmatched customer satisfaction. \nRenault stands true to its commitment to keep building on the success of Kwid with breakthrough product innovations. After the 1.0L MT and AMT launches last year, Renault has a lot of plans for KWID to keep pace with evolving customer preferences and has a strong product lifecycle strategy for Kwid. \nKwid was one of the best-selling cars in 2016 and will continue to be a key volume driver for Renault to achieve its aggressive growth plans in India. \nALSO READ: Renault Kaptur SUV coming to India this year For more news from India Today, follow us on Twitter @indiatoday and on Facebook at facebook.com/IndiaToday For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in . ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.
