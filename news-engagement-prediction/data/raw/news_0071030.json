And then judge him on that curriculum and stick with it. So my focus with him would be I'm going to judge him on being on time, on your meticulous work ethic and your great defense. If you do those things, you're going to hit second for the entire year and get 600 at-bats. But we're going to do a paradigm shift on how we judge you. And a lot of these kids, all they want to talk about is offense. So you have to shift it and create a system where they can be win-win and the organization can be win-win.\" \nAsked about being perhaps the highest-paid coach in history — given that he's making $21 million from the final year of his playing contract — A-Rod responded, \"Like I said, I'm very blessed and I'm very thankful.\" Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T08:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:14:22.642+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
