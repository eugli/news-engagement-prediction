Share via Twitter Arun Nevader / Getty Images This weekend, a fashion show took place at New York Fashion Week unlike any other. Yes, it featured beautiful women. And yes, they modeled lingerie—not something wholly unusual to fashion week. But the 16 women who walked in the AnaOno x #Cancerland fashion show were all real women who are currently battling or who have battled breast cancer —a first for fashion week. The fashion show, produced by Art Hearts Fashion , was born out of a partnership between #Cancerland , a breast cancer nonprofit, and AnaOno Intimates , a lingerie brand that creates products with breast cancer patients in mind. Designer Dana Donofree started AnaOno after her own experience with breast cancer. In 2010, Donofree was diagnosed with infiltrative ductal carcinoma, also known as invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). It's the most common type of breast cancer, accounting for about 80 percent of all diagnoses, according to the American Cancer Society . As part of her treatment, Donofree had a bilateral mastectomy—meaning a removal of both breasts—and she opted to have reconstruction with implants afterwards. That's when Donofree, who's been a fashion designer her whole life, learned something new about women's lingerie. \"I realized after my own reconstruction that traditional underwear was really difficult to wear,\" Donofree tells SELF. \"I couldn’t wear an underwire, I couldn’t wear a molded cup—all I could really wear was a sports bra or a layering tank.\" In 2014, Donofree decided to fix the lack of options by creating her own intimate apparel line, AnaOno. AnaOno's bras are comfortable for women who've had breast reconstruction, breast surgery, a mastectomy, or any another condition that requires a versatile, comfy bra. \"Our traditional bra market requires everyone to have two boobs, and my product does not require you to have two boobs,\" Donofree says. \"Our bras can accommodate you if you have one breast, no breasts, or two breasts. Just because you don’t have breasts doesn’t mean you don’t want to feel sexy and beautiful, and if you’re just always wearing a layering tank top, that only gets you jazzed for so long.\" In addition to sexy (and functional) bras, the brand also sells underwear and loungewear tailored to the needs of breast cancer patients. When #Cancerland approached Donofree with the opportunity to show a collection this NYFW, she jumped at the chance. And she knew she had to use real women who've had their lives impacted by breast cancer as her models. \"I know so many of these women are so incredibly proud of their bodies and what they’ve been through, and their scars are their strength,\" Donofree says. \"Having that courage and that zest to get up there and show the world what breast cancer really looks like was an incredible opportunity for our whole community.\" Each woman who walked in her show had had some sort of breast surgery, from a lumpectomy—where just portions of the breast are removed—to unilateral and bilateral mastectomies, with or without reconstruction. Some women were breast cancer survivors, while others are still aggressively fighting the disease. Donofree actively tried to pull together a diverse group of women. \"It was extremely important to me to show that breast cancer does not discriminate,\" she says. \"It doesn’t matter your size, your race, your age, your culture—none of that. Breast cancer affects us all around the world.\" Check out some of the incredible, brave women who walked in the AnaOno SS17x #Cancerland fashion show below. All proceeds from the show benefited #Cancerland, which works to directly help breast cancer patients.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T07:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T02:19:48.568+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
