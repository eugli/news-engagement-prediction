(Getty Images) \nUpdated at 11:40 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 11:40 p.m. ET \nDraymond Green accomplished a feet (oops) feat, that no other player in NBA history has done. \nOn Friday vs. the Grizzlies, the Warriors forward recorded a triple-double — without scoring 10 points. It's the first of its kind in NBA history. And it's OK Green didn't score much, because the Warriors had no problem putting up points on Memphis: They hung a 122 spot on the Grizzlies in Memphis. \nGreen's final line: 12 rebounds, 10 assists and 10 steals. He also put up four points on six shots from the floor. #DraymondGreen : 12 REB, 10 AST, & 10 STL. The 1st player EVER with a triple-double without 10+ PTS! Here's how the 2-Time All-Star did it: pic.twitter.com/MYAlQ5THHt — NBA (@NBA) February 11, 2017 \nWhile Green came up six points shy of the quadruple-double, his accomplishment regardless impacts like a roundhouse kick. \nGreen's performance helped the Dubs to their 45th win on the season, keeping them firmly in first place in the Western Conference.
