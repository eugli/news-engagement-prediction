She also feeds about 40 dogs daily. \nJOCELYN Ng never gave much thought to the difficulties street dogs and puppies face until one day about five years ago. \nWhat she saw changed her life forever and the 66-year-old kindergarten teacher is now a dedicated animal feeder and rescuer. \nShe related how a mother dog and her three-month-old puppy had changed her life. \n“I was driving around the USJ Subang Jaya area when I saw a mother dog and her puppy panting and running towards a factory area,’’ said Ng, who lives in Subang Jaya with her retired planter husband Peter, 71. \nWhat she saw opened her eyes to the challenges street animals go through to stay alive. \n“There were five more puppies there hiding in the drains. \n“It was in that moment I knew I was destined to bring them at least a little comfort,” said the mother of three children aged 47, 39 and 33. \nNg said she could not get the puppies out of her mind after coming home and she immediately contacted a friend to rescue the puppies. \nThe puppies were rescued the same evening. \nNg said the rescue was timely as the municipal council dogcatchers had been in the area the next morning. \n“Realising that I had just saved five puppies, I decided that saving canine lives was my true calling,\" added Ng. \nNow, come rain or shine, Ng goes out to feed about 40 dogs. \nNg, who has four grandchildren, also rescues street puppies and finds them homes. \nShe uses RM1,000 out of her RM1,700 monthly wages to buy kibbles for the street dogs she cares for. \nAlthough exhausted daily after her feeding sessions, Ng said she could not imagine not doing it. \nHer fervent hope is for street dogs and puppies to be treated with compassion and kindness.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T03:09:25.945+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
