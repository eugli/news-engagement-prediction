SEE ALSO: Car rooftop tent will make road trips a breeze \nThe \"Airport Jacket,\" which is set to take off later this year if its $76,000 Kickstarter gets funded (and it works), is the ultimate travel hack. So far, the Kickstarter has netted about $12,000 with 31 days to go. I SO need this: brand new, the Airport Jacket https://t.co/h03mOs3Z81 Holds 15 kilos: ipad, phone, 2 prs shoes, camera, laptop, 5 t-shirts.. pic.twitter.com/mLswIDZlQq \n— Amanda Statham (@Amanda_Statham) February 13, 2017 \nThe Australian couple behind the jacket says they are trying to make traveling less of a hassle by eliminating carry-on luggage. Similar jackets have tried to disrupt the travel world before — and make a lot of money on Kickstarter, so it's not a revolutionary concept. \nThe couple claims the nearly $180 jacket is cost-efficient since you can bring a coat on the plane for free and that's not always the case for baggage. The jury's still out, though, on whether this is truly \"the jacket that pays for itself.\" \nSo much stuff in your jacket. \nImage: airport jacket/kickstarter \nThis would be one heavy jacket if used to max capacity: it can carry up to 30 pounds with its 14 pockets, two detachable compartments and a duffel bag. The maker behind the jacket claim it can hold a laptop, iPad, two pairs of shoes, a pair of jeans, three T-shirts, two pairs of shorts, underwear, a light sweater, a dress, a liquids bag, wallet, phone and passport. \nThe jacket can be worn three different ways, depending on how much crap you are lugging around on your trip. There's also spring/summer jackets and warmer winter coats. All come in black and can be worn at hip length, three-quarter length or full length. #Startup Alert: What are your thoughts on the Airport Jacket? Practical or not? https://t.co/gKD2pmR3Ay via @circuitbreaker pic.twitter.com/qwbQhHR5Bb \n— The Hoffman Agency (@DailyBrew) February 13, 2017 \nWhat's not so clear is where to put everything once you reach your destination, or if you want to sit down while wearing your jacket without crushing all your electronics and toiletries. But with all the detachable pockets and sections available, with some careful planning you might be able to optimize your travel experience without your phone charger poking your back. \nFor other concerns check out the lengthy FAQ section. The jacket's inventors said while testing it out at an airport, they made it through security just fine. So maybe you will, too? But it's just as likely you'll spend 30 extra minutes dumping out everything in front of a TSA agent freaked out by your outerwear. \nIf you don't mind carrying your laptop just above your butt and your dirty underwear in that pocket by your hip, this is the jacket for you.
