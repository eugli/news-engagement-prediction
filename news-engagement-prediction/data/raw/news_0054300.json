And Ashwin has dismissed no less than 61 batsmen in India’s last three series. \nStarc reality for Kohli \n‘King’ Kohli will stride to the crease in Pune as the world’s top-ranked batsman and the first to score double hundreds in four successive series. His duel with strike bowler Mitchell Starc is likely to be a key battle. \n“I think Starc is a brilliant bowler for the sub-continental conditions. He bowls at a genuine pace, can swing the new ball and is an excellent exponent of reverse swing. I am sure he will challenge Kohli throughout the series,” Hussey told the Press Trust of India. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:12:31.742+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
