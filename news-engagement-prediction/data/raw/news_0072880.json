He would be the youngest best director winner in Oscars history. \nThe challenger: Barry Jenkins (Moonlight) \nBut Moonlight also shows rare directorial acumen and marks the arrival of another major film-making talent in Jenkins, who would be the first African-American winner of this award. \nThe outsider: Mel Gibson (Hacksaw Ridge) \nIt would be a big statement to give the award to the Australian after his exile from Hollywood following notorious anti-Semitic, racist and misogynist outbursts. But then again, the Oscars did give this award to Roman Polanski in 2003, despite his own Hollywood exile after admitting unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl. How many Oscars will La La Land win? \nThe magical musical has a record-equalling 14 nominations. That includes two for best song - meaning it can win a maximum of 13 statuettes. \nThe record number of wins in Oscar history is 11 (Titanic, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and Ben-Hur). The record for a musical is 10 (West Side Story). \nThe hype has cooled a little, so La La Land will do well if it gets into double digits. It's the favourite in 10 of the 13 categories in which it has nominations - the only ones in which it isn't frontrunner are best actor, original screenplay and sound editing. The most diverse Oscars ever? \nAfter two years of #OscarsSoWhite, in which there were no non-white acting nominees, three of the four acting trophies could go to black actors this year. \nIf Denzel, Viola and Mahershala all triumph, it will be the first time that black performers will be in the majority when the four acting winners get together for that post-Oscars photo hug. Who will mention Donald Trump? \nA lot of people, probably, directly or indirectly. There's a whole separate article on this. Image copyright Getty Images Will Lin-Manuel Miranda get a PEGOT? \nThere is a select group of 12 people who have got what is known as an EGOT - the set of Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony Awards. \nThere's an even more select group of just two people (composers Richard Rodgers and Marvin Hamlisch) who have got a PEGOT - all the above plus a Pulitzer Prize. \nLin-Manuel Miranda, who created the Broadway smash Hamilton, currently has a PEGT - he's just missing an O. He's nominated for best song for How Far I'll Go from Moana. \nLa La Land is hot favourite for that prize, of course. But could the fact it has two nominations in that category split the La La vote and let Lin-Manuel sneak in to complete the set? Image copyright AMPAS 21st time lucky for Oscar's biggest loser? \nSound recording engineer Kevin O'Connell notched up his 21st Oscar nomination this year for his sound mixing work on Hacksaw Ridge. \nThat's a great achievement - the shine only coming off it slightly when you consider the fact he's never won. \nThis could be his year. It could. Except La La Land is standing in his way. So it won't. \nAt the nominees' luncheon group photo this year, the Academy placed him in the middle, next to the giant Oscars statuette - and the face he made shows he's past caring. Sibling rivalry for visual effects nominees \nTwo British brothers are nominated for best visual effects this year, for different films. \nPaul Corbould is nominated for Doctor Strange, while Neil Corbould is shortlisted for Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. \nNeil has won twice before - for Gladiator and Gravity - while Paul, previously nominated for Guardians of the Galaxy, has never won. \nIt's a talented family. There's another visual effects wizard brother, Chris, who won an Oscar for Inception. Fortunately for the sake of preventing further family rivalry, he's not nominated this year. \nFollow us on Facebook , on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts , or on Instagram at bbcnewsents .
