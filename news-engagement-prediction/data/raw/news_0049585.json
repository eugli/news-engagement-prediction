The auction house does not disclose the names of buyers. \nBidding for the phone started at $100,000. \nIn pics: Hitler’s ‘weapon of mass destruction’ is up for auction \nThe red telephone includes a Nazi party symbol and Hitler’s name engraved on the back. Occupying Russian officers gave the phone to a British officer, Sir Ralph Rayner, during a visit to Hitler’s bunker in Berlin. The phone was used in vehicles and trains as well as Hitler’s field headquarters. \nKornfeld says a porcelain figure of an Alsatian dog, also owned by Hitler, also sold Sunday to a different bidder for $24,300. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T10:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T05:15:43.995+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
