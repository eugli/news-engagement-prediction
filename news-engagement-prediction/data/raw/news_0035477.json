Barnett is a registered sex offender in Florida. \nIf convicted, Barnett faces up to 10 years in prison. Jail records don’t say whether he’s hired a lawyer. \nAn affidavit says Barnett offered to pay another man $10,000 to place at least 10 “improvised explosive bombs” disguised in food-item packaging in stores from New York to Florida. The man went to authorities. \n(TM and © Copyright 2016 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries. CBS RADIO and EYE Logo TM and Copyright 2017 CBS Broadcasting Inc. Used under license.
