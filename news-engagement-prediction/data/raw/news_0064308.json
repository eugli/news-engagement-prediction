That was our prevailing view, however, there was no certainty of that. It wasn’t a decision of us, it was ASADA. In the agreements with the club and the individuals, it was explicit that it didn’t mean the players wouldn’t be charged.” \nLIVE stream every game of the JLT Community Series (the AFL preseason competition) on FOX SPORTS.

I rang him last night and I said, ‘you know, you’ve really upset me here because you’ve gone back on your word, Gil’. \n“’You told me one thing and now you’re doing something else’. “He then said to me, ‘there is a 99 per cent chance that the players won’t be charged.’ And I said, ‘well, I’d like to believe you but are you happy for me to use that language in front of the players?’ And he said, ‘oh no, you can’t do that’. \n“And I said, ‘well f--k, you’re telling me one thing and over here I can’t tell anything to the players’.” \nThe league was hoping to “protect the players” through the process, according to McLachlan. \n“We were trying to protect the players the best we could,” he said. \n“What we ultimately agreed was ... an agreement where potentially all the available discounts would be available to the players if they ultimately served infraction notices. You can google it now. That was a priority of ours.” \nBut McLachlan was keen to stress that there was “not anything new” in the tapes. \n“This has been through the Federal Court. There were millions of documents discovered. Then it was appealed to Full Court of the Federal Court and both times (AFL and ASADA’s conduct) was unanimously found to be legal,” he argued. \n“I’m disappointed. Essendon had their season launch last night. They’re 5000 members up year on year. They’ve got an exciting list, they’ve got players back and they want to move forward. \n“There’s not anything new in this. There’s no new facts.” \nThe AFL boss said he understood why some have been so angered by the process. \n“I understand people feel (aggrieved). I can’t help how people feel. It was an incredibly difficult circumstance,” he said. \n“We sit here today and there was a situation where a program was run and in the end ... the club accepted the supplements program was run, there was an unacceptable risk administered to players and we still don’t know what they were given. \n“In the end there has to be accountability for that. What happened, what happened. \n“It was an incredibly tumultuous period. Having gone through Federal Court cases, I think the AFL’s decisiveness ended up being justified. But you don’t walk away from the fact it was an incredibly difficult time.” \nDays after the recording of the tape, following the release of an interim Australia Sports Anti-Doping Authority report, the AFL charged Hird, Thompson, club doctor Bruce Reid, Corcoran and the club itself with bringing the game into disrepute. The AFL handed down a series of penalties, including kicking Essendon out of the 2013 finals, a $2 million fine and stripping of draft picks. \nHird was suspended for 12 months, while Corcoran and Thompson were also punished. \nIn 2015, the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled the 34 past and present Bombers players be banned for the 2016 season. \n— With AAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:07:18.208+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
