Six months before rushing water ripped a huge hole in a channel that drains a Northern California reservoir, state inspectors said the concrete spillway was sound. And as officials puzzle through how to repair it, federal regulators have ordered the state to figure out what went wrong at Oroville Dam. Earlier inspection reports offer potential clues, including cracks on the spillway surface that could either be cosmetic or indicate deeper problems. In recent years, construction crews patched cracks - including in the area where water burrowed a huge pit last week. If past repairs were not done properly, water could infiltrate and eventually tear through the concrete. Water gushes down the Oroville Dam's main spillway. The Oroville Reservoir is continuing to drain Wednesday as state water officials scrambled to reduce the lake's level ahead of impending storms. Robert Bea, professor emeritus of civil and environmental engineering at University of California, Berkeley, said it's 'obvious those repairs didn't work.' 'We don't have details on the repairs, but they put cement into the cracks and troweled it over,' Bea said. 'I call it 'patch and pray.'' Damage to the main spillway triggered a series of problems that threatened to unleash a torrent of water on cities downstream, putting thousands of homes at risk. On Tuesday, officials said the immediate danger had passed, and allowed nearly 200,000 residents to go home after evacuation orders scattered them for nearly two days. Water flows out of the damaged spillway at Oroville Dam as crews worked around the clock in an attempt to reinforce the structure Inspectors with the state agency that both operates and checks the dam, the nation's tallest at 770 feet, went into the half-mile-long spillway in 2014 and 2015 and did not find any concerns. 'Conditions appeared to be normal,' the inspector wrote in reports from both years. Getting into the channel affords both a closer view of cracks as well as a chance to tap it with a special hammer, with the sound telling a trained ear whether the concrete is solid or there may be erosion in the earth below. Last August, a team of inspectors only checked the channel from vistas around it, not inside. They concluded that everything looked fine.
