The actor’s single-engine Husky had a near miss with an American Airlines 737 earlier today, after Ford mistakenly attempted to land on a taxiway at California’s John Wayne Airport in Orange County. According to NBC , air traffic controllers had directed him toward the runway and that he had even read their instructions back to them. However, he instead narrowly flew just over the top of the plane loaded with 110 passengers that shortly thereafter departed for Dallas. Those passengers probably never knew just how close they’d come to Han Solo himself, or to being traumatized forever. \nFord was captured on air traffic control recordings asking, “Was that airliner meant to be underneath me?” Ha ha! It’s just that kind of dry, cool wit that makes him such a beloved action hero, as well as a man who is alarmingly unfazed by time after time of nearly killing his damn self in one of his consarned flying machines . Harrison Ford, why can’t you take up a safe, normal 74-year-old’s hobby, like home-brewing terrible political opinions? \nAnyway, landing on a taxiway is a violation of Federal Aviation Administration safety rules, which means this incident is currently under investigation. And the FAA could choose to respond with something as minor as a warning letter written by someone strenuously avoiding the use of Air Force One quotes, or it could say enough is enough and suspend of his pilot’s license—something that, while Ford is “revered as an excellent pilot in aviation circles,” would certainly give us all some peace of mind. \nSubmit your Newswire tips here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:36:51.783+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
