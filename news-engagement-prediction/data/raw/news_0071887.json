Or you could just smash your enemies to pieces as Troll, I guess.\nTroll and I supports split-screen co-operative gameplay, which is frankly a missed feature that was once commonplace for games. The Switch version will, of course, make use of the Joy-Con controllers and be playable both at home and on the go.\nWe've yet to get our hands on the game ourselves, but we're hoping that this will shape up to be a decent co-op game.\nTroll and I releases on March 24th for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC, and has a tentative spring schedule for the Switch.\nRead More Latest Gaming Xbox Live Games with Gold for March Could Sonic Mania be a return to form?
