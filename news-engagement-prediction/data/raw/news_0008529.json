That shut out the vast majority of its drivers, who offer rides in personal vehicles.\nLyft, Uber’s largest rival, had already struck a deal with Massport to begin pickup service at Logan, beginning Wednesday.\nGet Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news, delivered weekdays. Each company will pay a fee of $3.25 per ride, which will be passed along to passengers. Passengers will be directed to specific pick-up locations from their terminals, as opposed to curbside pickup.\nBoth companies were already able to bring passengers to Logan. But Boston had been one of the last big-city airports in the country to not allow so-called transportation network services to pick up passengers. That gave taxis and livery services, who have been fighting the rise of Uber and Lyft, control of ground transportation options at the airport.\nIn New York, where Uber is allowed to pick up passengers at airports, the company found itself the target of criticism over President Trump’s immigration ban. Taxi drivers at John F. Kennedy International Airport had staged a one-hour strike Saturday night to protest the Trump order. Uber, meanwhile, had offered low-price fares that night, triggering a social media backlash that urged passengers to delete the company’s smartphone app.\nAdvertisement\nUber responded by saying it would find ways to compensate drivers stuck overseas because of the ban.\nAdam Vaccaro can be reached at adam.vaccaro@globe.com .
