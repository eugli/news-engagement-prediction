Miller - The Washington Times - Saturday, February 25, 2017 \nPresident Trump announced Saturday that he would not be attending the White House Correspondents Association Dinner in April, punctuating his combative relationship with the news media. \n“I will not be attending the White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner this year. Please wish everyone well and have a great evening!” tweeted Mr. Trump. \nThe annual dinner is a traditionally a light-hearted event featuring comedians, with the president typically giving a roast-style speech. \nBut Mr. Trump has battled the press throughout the presidential campaign and has had repeated run-ins with reporters since taking office. He’s railed against what he calls “fake news” and recently denounced the news media as “enemies of the American people.” \nThe Washington Press corps protested Friday when several major news outlets, including the New York Times and CNN, were barred from an off-camera press gaggle with White House press secretary Sean Spicer. \nRumors have swirled that some news organizations would boycott the White House Correspondents Association Dinner.
