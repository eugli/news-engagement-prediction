Share Comments By Dan Bloom 01:04, 7 FEB 2017 Updated 01:06, 7 FEB 2017 News The Prime Minister has an awful lot of work on her hands (Photo: AFP) politics Parliament is holding three late-night debates before it gives Theresa May permission to trigger Article 50.\nHours are slipping by in the House of Commons as MPs tussle over more than 100 pages of amendments to the so-called Brexit Bill.\nBut has it actually achieved any change to the law?\nSo far, no.\nThe first midnight finish saw furious scenes as ex- SNP leader Alex Salmond clashed with Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle.\nThe debate chair hollered \"you should know better!\" (below) as the SNP complained they had not had enough time to debate.\nLabour MPs were also furious at dozens of amendments being simply struck from the debate.\nJeremy Corbyn turned up to the midnight sessions wearing a \"<3 UNIONS\" badge, vowing not to block Article 50 - just amend it.\nTory MPs were more laid-back after being bussed in specially from their lavish fundraising ball to vote.\nSo far the government's killed off all four amendments (and counting) to the Article 50 Bill that actually got a vote.\nHere's what they were.\n1. Making Theresa May update MPs every two months Tory ministers including Karen Bradley and Chris Grayling were spotted on a bus (Photo: Mirror/Mikey Smith) A Labour amendment would have forced the Prime Minister to report back on her Brexit plan every two months.\nSigned by Jeremy Corbyn , it was designed to give more scrutiny in Parliament as negotiations are carried out.\nSome 212 Labour MPs backed the plan while just four opposed it. The SNP and Lib Dems also backed it.\nBut it was defeated 333-284 after the Tories mounted a heavy whipping effort, including a 24-seater minibus from their ball.\n2. Making her update Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland The Tories also killed off a Labour bid to make the Prime Minister give regular updates to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThe amendment would have also made her 'joint ministerial committee', technically a talking shop with the devolved governments, cemented in law.\nIt was defeated 333-276.\n3. Getting every nation's approval for Article 50 Scottish MPs wanted to ensure Scotland gave approval for invoking Article 50 (Photo: Getty) The SNP wanted to block Article 50 unless the Prime Minister had agreement from all three of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland.\nWith Scotland voting solidly Remain, this would've been a long time coming.\nAny agreement would have to stay in place for a month before becoming valid enough to trigger Article 50.\nBut this one was always doomed to fail because most Labour MPs chose not to vote one way or the other.\nIt was defeated 332-62.\n4. Keeping promises on funding for Wales Plaid Cymru led a bid to ensure lavish promises of Welsh funding by the Leave campaign would be kept.\nThe amendment, backed by Labour, would have forced the government to publish a report on how the promises stacked up.\nOnce again the Tories simply outnumbered everyone else and it failed 330-267.\n Politics Newsletter Follow @DailyMirror Subscribe to our Politics Conservative Party SNP House of Commons Theresa May Jeremy Corbyn Lindsay Hoyle Alex Salmond Brexit Politics", "external_links": ["https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=DailyMirror"], "published": "2017-02-07T03:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:24:56.400+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
