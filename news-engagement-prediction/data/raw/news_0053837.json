'The bat ate the mangoes' \nAfter noticing half-eaten mangoes left strewn across his backyard this week, Concord resident TK Hoh woke on Tuesday morning to find a flying fox caught in the net he used to cover his tree. \n\"I walked to my beloved mango tree and noticed a pile of leaves on the ground and when I looked up, lo and behold there was this creature staring at me,\" Mr Hoh said. \n\"It was all entangled in the net. \n\"This was the first time in five years since we've had this mango tree.\" Photo: Volunteer WIRES rescuer Meg says she has been rescuing up to 20 flying foxes a day. (Supplied: TK Hoh) \nMr Hoh called WIRES whose rescuer arrived within an hour to free the animal. \n\"The WIRES lady came straight to the back, cut the net and wrapped the bat up in a blanket,\" Mr Hoh said. Don't attempt to free the bats \nStanmore resident Luciano Zappulla also had a bat caught in his net this week after it tried to eat from his fig tree. \n\"The poor thing, I tried to free him but it was going to bite me,\" he said. \n\"I don't know how it got inside there. \n\"Next time I'll put in a net with smaller holes.\" Photo: Large holed nets used to cover fruit trees can easily trap wildlife searching for food. (Supplied: Sarah Curran) \nMs Curran, who has recently also rescued snakes and birds caught in backyard tree nets, advised residents to use nets with a fine mesh that \"you can't poke your finger through\". \nShe also said to never approach a tangled bat to prevent further injury to the animal and to avoid getting bitten. \nUnder 1 per cent of flying foxes may carry Australian bat lyssavirus, a virus linked to rabies. What happens to the bats \nMs Curran said all flying fox rescuers, of which there are just under 300 in the Sydney metropolitan area, have been vaccinated and trained to rescue the animals. \nShe said netted bats were usually distressed, suffering from heat stress and injured wings.
