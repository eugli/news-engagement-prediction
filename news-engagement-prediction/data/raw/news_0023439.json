Well, according to one Australian teacher, this horrifying act of negligent parenting is worth sending home a warning - marked with a sad face on top in case there's any question as to how you should feel upon delivery.\nHere's the deal: In Australia, a mom sent her 3-year-old to kindergarten with a slice of chocolate cake in the lunch bag. Unfortunately, a slice of this kind falls within the school's \"Red Food Category,\" which encompasses unhealthy foods \"that may contain excess energy (kilojoules), saturated fat, added sugar and/or salt.\" The list also includes sodas and deep-fried foods and is part of a full set of nutrition guidelines that all schools follow Down Under.\nA friend of the officially-warned mother, Melinda Tankard Reist, who is also an author and advocate for women and girls, took to Facebook to back up her pal. Her post clearly hit a nerve, with more than 600 comments to date:\n\"My friend (mother of 8 healthy children, what follows relating to no. 7) received this today from her 3-year-old's kindy,\" Tankard Reist wrote (kindy = kindergarten). \"I told her to put in two slices tomorrow and tell them to get lost.\"\n\"My child once got a note like that for graham crackers!\" wrote one commenter, Nicole Renee.\nAnother commenter, Lena Giroux, voiced a different tactic for dealing with strict nutrition rules at school. \"My kids' Elem school had the same kind of rules. I obeyed them. They ate what they wanted at home.\"\nEither way, this makes us really, really want a slice of chocolate cake.\nClick to expand Replay Video Sweet Baby Disapproves of Dad's Singing We're not sure if this baby is unhappy about his dad's singing or because he's reached his first birthday, but it's clear that this is one disgruntled baby!
