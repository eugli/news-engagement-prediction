Since then he spoke about his little daughter everywhere. He tried to not be possessive but he couldn’t. After all, fathers are always feel that way the moment they hold their daughters in their arms. Last year, he teased us by posting a picture on his Instagram which had Misha’s tiny little feet. Today, he shared yet another picture of his little girl and this time it’s a full one, well almost. Shahid can be seen holding his baby with the sea behind and clicking a selfie. The image has the little one looking at his father’s hand, perhaps trying to figure out why he is on his phone, when she is with him. That’s a really adorable picture. (Also read: Shahid Kapoor: Misha is better than anything I could ever ask for ) \nAll this while Shahid has been shielding his daughter’s face from the paparazzi. We can totally understand that. He is a father of a few month old kid and will do anything to keep her away from any kind of chaos. Hence we often spot him with his wifey Mira Rajput, carrying Misha wrapped in a blanket. He later revealed the tiny feet of his kid which was simply adorable. But this new picture of him with his daughter is the best thing you will see today. Check it out right here. A photo posted by Shahid Kapoor (@shahidkapoor) on Feb 6, 2017 at 5:00am PST \nTalking about Shahid shielding his daughter’s face from the prying media, the actor had even tweeted about it saying how it is not good for little kids. \nUnfortunate how some journos don’t realise how bad 20 cameras flashing 2 feet away are for an infants eyes. No common sense in their dna. \n— Shahid Kapoor (@shahidkapoor) January 5, 2017 \nWell, he is right and we should wait for him to share more such cutesy pics of his kid.
