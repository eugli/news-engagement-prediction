Slot to 247Sports Links \nThe Chicago Cubs' 2016 World Series trophy spent some time with the team's Double-A affiliate, which plays in Knoxville, Tenn., this week. \nSo it was only right that the Tennessee Smokies took the trophy to the Pat Summit Plaza, named after the legendary Volunteers women's basketball coach, on the University of Tennessee campus. \nThe World Series Trophy couldn't make a stop in East Tennessee w/o visiting a special lady who knows something about collecting hardware pic.twitter.com/xzx4xT3co9 â€” Tennessee Smokies (@smokiesbaseball) February 3, 2017 \nSummit built a powerhouse program at Tennesse, and was a large part of increasing the relevance of women's basketball. She captured eight national titles, which trails only UConn coach Geno Auriemma (11) for the most all time in the sport. \nThe former Tennessee coach stepped down in 2012 after she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, and Summit passed away at the age of 64 in June 2016. \nIn November, the Cubs ended a 108-year title drought by defeating the Cleveland Indians in seven games. Chicago pulled off the feat after erasing a 3-1 series deficit. \nIt's the type of effort that Summit, who was known for her never-say-die attitude, would have been proud of.
