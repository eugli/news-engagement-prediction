The “Scream Queens” actress decided to address her mental health in her new book, I Don’t Belong to You: Quiet the Noise and Find Your Voice . She told Cosmo that she hopes it inspires her fans to prioritize their own emotional wellness. \n“I felt like, ‘Oh my gosh, I’m so alone,’” Palmer told the publication. “Then as I grew, I realized I wasn’t the only person going through this.” \nPalmer has also found solace in therapy and meditation , which research shows may ease symptoms of anxiety . She said that she’s finally in a place where she feels comfortable enough to stand up for herself and her mental health. When Trey Songz featured Palmer in his “Pick Up The Phone” music video , allegedly without her permission, Palmer was quick to speak up . \n“In general, it’s very nerve-wracking to say how you feel,” she explained. “But I’ve gained so much assuredness in myself.” \nPalmer also candidly discussed dealing with a mental health condition last June, when she dropped her album “Waited to Exhale.” The title was a nod to her tendency to hold her breath ― a common symptom of anxiety and panic attacks . \n“ My anxiety, caused by the habit of unconsciously holding my breath , coupled with the stress of my personal life at that time, created a lot of hard years of depression for me,” she wrote on her website when she announced the album’s release. \nThe star is part of an ever-growing list of celebrities who have spoken publicly about mental illness and the negative stereotypes attached to it. And their openness is not only refreshing, it’s effective: Experts say sharing these stories with a wide audience is crucial to removing the stigma that surrounds mental health. \nProps to her for being a vocal advocate on this issue.
