After the release of Future last week, Hendrix is dropping a second more personal album, HNDRXX , Friday. \nIn the second part of his recent interview with Zane Lowe on Beats 1 radio, the Atlanta rapper revealed that one song on the album might cause some controversy. \n“It might get more attention than I want it to get. It might get the wrong attention, it might get great attention. Who knows? I just know it’s a song I feel good about. This is me not holding anything back,” Future told Lowe when he asked him about the song. \nWhen Lowe mentioned the \"Mask Off\" emcee's second album Honest , Future made a revealing observation. \n“I was just using it as a title instead of actually being honest in the music. This is me opening up and just letting it all out so I can just move past it and certain things, I don’t have to speak on it again,” he said. \nFuture also revealed that Metro Boomin and Mike Will Made It have producer credits on HNDRXX, which also features Rihanna and The Weeknd .
