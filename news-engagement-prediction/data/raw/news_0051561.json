But the writer recently wrote a gush piece about one actress who has been winning hearts with her words. Kangana Ranaut has been in the news recently for all the right reasons. Her appearance on Koffee With Karan 5 has been one of the most memorable and most spoken about episodes yet. While Karan took her comments sportingly Saif was floored and shocked with his leading lady in Rangoon. Now Kangana is known to speak her mind but we didn’t expect to hear so much! Writer Shobha De is also all praise for the Queen and gushed about Kangana in her column for Mumbai Mirror. \nShe says,” Last week, several incredulous jaws dropped to the floor when the spunky star took on Karan Johar on his show, and made it clear she was there to talk turkey. Karan was sporting enough to take it on the chin, indulge his gorgeous guest and carry on with the show. That is Karan, the professional. Considering Kangana had two smart co-stars as co-guests (of course, they were promoting a movie ­ that’s what all shows are about these days), she still managed to hold her own. Even the super suave Nawab, Saif Ali Khan, looked at Kangana with what seemed like newfound respect. She floored Saif and later Shahid Kapoor with her repartee and quick wit. Given that this is an unscripted show, nobody can take the credit for Kangana’s smarts.” (ALSO READ: You can definitely ape these 6 styles of Kangana Ranaut from Rangoon promotions ) \nShe also adds,” I think Bollywood is uncomfortable with women like her. But it is women like her who are the real game changers. If she refuses to play the glamorous prop in hero-dominated films, it is because she puts a high value on herself. In the bargain, she probably loses out on lakhs. But if that was her main concern, she would have made significantly different choices and been a much wealthier star. \nWhen it comes to men, well, there are versions and there are versions. Frankly, Kangana needs a very special kind of fellow to `get’ her. From all accounts she can be a difficult customer ­ quite a handful. The other girls don’t seem to like her all that much. And the men are plain terrified. Kangana, for all her complexities, is such an interesting character. If she chooses to, she can simper away like the rest. But that choice is hers and hers alone. It is said she wants full credit if her latest period film succeeds. Even if it doesn’t, she’d have worked with a top class team and that’s reward enough for most good actors.” \nWe can’t help but agree with Shobha De on this one! What do you think?
