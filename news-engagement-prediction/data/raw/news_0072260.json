The symbol was all over the place (starting with the runway), but also positioned at the center of hoop earrings and tilted on the flaps of structured satchels. Perhaps that's because this season, Karl Lagerfeld and accessories designer Silvia Venturini Fendi traced their roots back to 1925, the birth of the fashion house. The duo worked together to deliver a fresh, clean start. \nSuits and blazers are feminized by fur cuffs or the swishing of a silk maxi skirt underneath. The bags are ornate, offered in velvet, striped python, and leather. While the coats don't carry the iconic \"F\"s, you'd recognize them anywhere — they're made of camel-colored fur and stitched with oversize pockets. Meanwhile, cropped sweaters carry a geometric pattern inspired by Viennese woodblock printing, keeping things youthful, which is always expected at Fendi. \nOversize opticals and aviators play up vintage vibes, while laser-cut coordinates bring the entire line a touch of modernity — a rightful balance. Leaf prints keep the clothes in season, a notable direction other labels seem to be straying from. But the sheer midis can be worn at any time of the year. They are romantic and cinematic thanks to standout daisy appliqués, and they seem to stop at just the right spot, revealing the new patent-knit Cuissard boot, a must have in cherry red. \nRest assured, Silvia didn't short the accessory fiend. She can add to her Strap You collection with fur shoulder straps in red, black, and deep teal, or get on board with cutout flowers or the classic double \"F.\" Plus, the introduction of the Run Away double-handle bag and a keychain-like accordion of clutches answers the question we asked at Gucci : is one pouch ever enough? \nAs far as models go, Binx Walton, Imaan Hammam, Romee Strijd, Stella Maxwell, Kendall Jenner, and Gigi Hadid all emerged on the catwalk. But it was Bella Hadid's ensemble that captured us. She wore the new essentials: a loose white shirt dress, those leather thigh-highs, and a large peekaboo tote, proving that the very best Fendi look truly starts with the basics.
