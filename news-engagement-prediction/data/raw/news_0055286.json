On Wednesday, a member of the investigative teams said the light plane should have been able to withstand a single engine failure.\nGreg Reynolds De Haven with his sister Denelle Wichts.

They so appreciate the kindness they’ve been shown there in Australia,” she said.\nThe group had posted a number of pictures from their trip to New Zealand and Australian online including visits to luxury golf courses and wineries. They were en route to play golf on King Island when the plane crashed.\nThe co founder of Glenn Garland’s company CLEAResult Jim Stimmel said he was “devastated” to hear about the loss of the man who was inspirational to many.\n“Glenn Garland was more than a colleague to me, he was a visionary and a close friend. I am devastated to hear of his passing and my heart and thoughts are with his family. We have all lost an incredible man. I am blessed to have known and worked closely with Glenn for many years,” he said.\nDFO plane crash victim Glenn Garland. Source: Supplied \nPilot Max Quartermain.
