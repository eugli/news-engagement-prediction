By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: February 20, 2017 9:56 AM Samajwadi Party’s Rajendra Chaudhary. (ANI) \nA day after PM Narendra Modi generated a huge controversy by virtually claiming that in Uttar Pradesh the Samajwadi Party led Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav government was playing vote bank politics and even discriminating against the Hindus in the state with his statement during the Fatehpur rally on Sunday that, “When electricity is available on Ramzan, then it should be made available during Diwali too.” (“Ramzan me bijli aati hai tho Diwali me bhi aani chahiye; Bhedbhav nahi hona chahiye). PM Modi added, “there shouldn’t be any discrimination.” For those who may have missed the phrase, PM Modi underlined his message by saying “If there is a Kabaristaan, there should be Shamshaan too”. PM said it was because of policies like this that will cost Akhilesh Yadav his Chief ministership and also indicated that the UP CM already knew of his fate in the elections as “The glow has disappeared from Akhilesh Yadav’s face, his voice has become feeble. SP chief has accepted that he has lost the game”. \nYou may also want to watch- \nAt his Fatehpur rally, PM Modi talked about the guidance of Sardar Patel and said, “Would like to recall Sardar Sahab, had the previous governments implemented his guidelines, the fate of our country would have been different.” He also talked about the development of UP should begin again at a fast pace and said, “Vanvaas of Vikas in Uttar Pradesh must end now; Country is moving ahead at fast pace & so must Uttar Pradesh.” \nWatch video here- #Watch Narendra Modi aur Amit Shah dono aatankwaadi hain,aatank paida kar rahe hain loktantra mein says Samajwadi Party’s Rajendra Chaudhary pic.twitter.com/KGdeunr2m0 \n— ANI UP (@ANINewsUP) February 20, 2017 \nPM Narendra Modi also took a jibe at the Samajwadi Party’s alliance with Congress and said, “Unhone socha tu bhi doob raha hai, mai bhi doob raha hu, arrey chalo yaar haanth pakad lein, saath bach jayein. Jab unhone hath pakda, tab nikle rath par. Taar k taar latak rahe the, kaanp rahe the ki current na lag jaye; Akhilesh nhi, unke naye saathi.” he went on to say that “SP did not respect ideals of Ram Manohar Lohia ji by allying with the Congress.” Please Wait while comments are loading...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T11:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T06:44:09.717+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
