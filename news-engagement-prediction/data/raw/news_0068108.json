Omar Kelly have received three additional picks in the 2017 NFL draft in compensation for last offseason's free-agent departures.\nThe Dolphins received a third-round pick and two fifth-round picks for losing defensive end Olivier Vernon (who signed with the New York Giants ), running back Lamar Miller ( Houston Texans ) and receiver Rishard Matthews ( Tennessee Titans ), the league announced Friday. \nAll three of those players — 2012 Dolphins draft picks — had productive 2016 seasons with their new teams, which is factored into the NFL ’s compensatory pick formula. \nThe three new draft picks give the Dolphins seven total selections in April’s draft. They traded away two third-day picks to Minnesota last year in order to draft receiver Leonte Carroo and then agreed to send a seventh-round pick to Jacksonville in the pending trade for tight end Julius Thomas . That deal with the Jaguars can’t become official until March 9. \nMiami got the third-round compensatory pick (No. 97 overall) for losing Vernon, who signed an $85 million deal with the Giants last offseason. The Dolphins wisely took the transition tag off Vernon before free agency began to land the compensatory pick, because they knew they weren't willing to match the offers made from the three teams bidding on him. \nThe Miami Dolphins have had their share of underachieving draft picks, but none more disappointing than ... \nThe Dolphins were given the 180th and 186th overall picks for the losses of Miller, who rushed for 1,073 yards and scored six touchdowns in Houston, and Matthews, who caught 65 passes for 945 yards and nine touchdowns with Tennessee. \nThis year’s draft is April 27-29 in Philadelphia. The Dolphins will be picking No. 22 overall by virtue of their 10-6 finish.
