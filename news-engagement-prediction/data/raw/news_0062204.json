The U.S. border with Mexico, which stretches along four states from California to McCaul's state of Texas, spans roughly 2,000 miles. \nStory Continued Below\nMcCaul said that while some form of physical barrier is needed, a more holistic approach would minimize the crossing of undocumented immigrants, adding that much of the area between San Diego and El Paso is already covered by secure fencing. \n\"We need a physical barrier, multi-layered approach, using both infrastructure but also technology and personnel,\" he said. \"Those are the three main things that border patrol tells us they need.\"\n\nDHS chief softens Trump's talk on immigration By Nolan D. McCaskill \nThe Texas congressman added that the wall was \"necessary in some places to basically slow down illegals or potential terrorists.\"\nMcCaul's position on Trump's border wall proposal has shifted repeatedly. In August 2015, McCaul called the idea \"kind of a simplistic\" and a \"knee-jerk response.\" After Trump's electoral victory, however, the Homeland Security chairman struck a much more supportive tone. \n\"We are going to build the wall. Period,\" McCaul wrote in a Fox News op-ed . \"In the process, I pledge to stand side-by-side with the Trump administration to throw out Obama’s reckless immigration policies and start enforcing our nation’s laws.\"\nMcCaul joined Ryan, Rep. John Carter and several Department of Homeland Security officials Wednesday for a tour of the Texan portion of the southern border, as part of a new push to fund Trump's border wall proposal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T14:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:57:36.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
