Feb 27, 2017 at 2:15p ET 0Shares \nVince Dunn of the Chicago Wolves didn’t pick the fight, but he finished it. \nLate in the third period of a game Saturday night between the Wolves — the St. Louis Blues’ American Hockey League affiliate — and the Iowa Wild, a brawl broke out on the ice. It started when Kurtis Gabriel, a 23-year-old forward with the Wild, jabbed Dunn, a 20-year-0ld defenseman for Chicago, with both hands on his stick. With that, fists flew. \nSeveral players left the ice at Allstate Arena in Rosemont, Illinois, but they weren’t done fighting. Video shows players still in full gear going at it some time later in a nearby runway. \nAt one point, Gabriel tracked down Dunn, who was walking toward the locker room. Gabriel, who at 6-foot-3, 220 pounds, has three inches and 28 pounds on Dunn, grabbed Dunn, who responded with a right to the face that dropped the Iowa aggressor to the floor. \nDunn and the Wolves got the better of the Wild on the ice, too. Dunn had the game-winner in Chicago’s 4-1 win Saturday, then scored two more goals Sunday as the Wolves made it back-to-back wins over Iowa, 4-3. \nThe fisticuffs begin at the 4:15 mark of the video below. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:54:34.596+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
