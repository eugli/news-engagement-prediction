(Harry How/Getty Images) \nPACIFIC PALISADES, Calif. – The birdie putt was just outside 8 feet. The money at stake was $144,000. It was Kelly Kraft’s to lose – and he could do nothing but nervously watch while fighting off the natural urge to root against his opponent. \nIt was last Sunday afternoon on the 18th green at Pebble Beach. Magnificent on his front nine and steady on the back, Kraft had played his way into second place behind close friend Jordan Spieth. But he had just missed his own birdie putt from inside 9 feet to clinch solo second. That left the door open for playing partner Dustin Johnson to share runner-up honors if he could drain that 8-footer. \nSolo second at the AT&T Pebble Beach was worth $777,600. A tie for second was worth $633,600. Hence the $144K difference. That one putt was worth nearly as much as Kraft made in his first two years as a pro. \nAs Johnson evaluated his line, Kraft walked over to his caddie Boston Brittain. They stared at each other. Solo second – and finishing one shot ahead of the reigning U.S. Open champ – sure sounded better than a tie. The additional money was definitely better for the bank account. And there were key FedExCup points also on the line. \n“Man, we could really use a miss here,” Brittain said. \n“I don’t think we’re gonna get it,” replied Kraft, knowing Johnson was finishing hot with birdies on his previous two holes. \nThe putt slid past the hole. Johnson settled for third. Kraft and Brittain discreetly rejoiced. Back in Denton, Texas, the celebration was more robust. Kraft’s parents had been watching the TV coverage with Brittain’s parents. Their boys would not be coming home as regularly scheduled. Thanks to Kraft’s best-ever result on TOUR, they top-10ed their way into this week’s Genesis Open at Riviera. \n“I wasn’t rooting against him to miss it,” Kraft said. “But at the same time it’s nice to make a little extra cash. It shook out in my favor that time. Maybe next time it won’t.” \nOr maybe there won’t be a next time. Maybe Kraft – the 2011 U.S. Amateur champ who seems to finally be on solid footing – won’t leave anything to chance. Maybe Sunday’s solo second sandwiched between Spieth and Johnson, two of golf’s brightest stars, will be the turning point of Kraft’s career. \nThe money is nice. So is the improved world ranking, from 387 to 171. But the impact of the result – his best by far on TOUR -- could be greater. Kraft improved his TOUR status and will be able to schedule other tournaments; he’s hoping to play in most of the Florida Swing events after last year not being able to get into any of them. And at 20th in FedExCup points, he’ll have no worries keeping his TOUR card should he maintain form. He’s at 393 points now; last year, it took 454 points to finish inside the top 125. \n“It’s like a weight has been lifted on him,” Brittain said. “I definitely see this as a turning point and that he’ll be in contention more.” \nOn Sunday, Spieth took time out of his own celebration to give Kraft a hug. He knows the significance of Sunday’s result. \n“I root hard for Kelly,” Spieth said. “He’s one of the favorites on my PGA TOUR app. He’s a good friend and somebody that I’ve enjoyed … getting better with over the last few years. It was awesome to see. It was fantastic that he finished solo second. That’s huge. \n“Does a lot for him as far as the way he’s thinking about the year, job security for next year. Just frees somebody up a lot.” \nFinally, it seems, Kraft is meeting the expectations that come with being a U.S. Amateur champion. Which is ironic considering that his desire to meet those expectations the past few years has been holding him back. Highlights Kelly Kraft's approach to 6 feet yields birdie at AT&T Pebble Beach \nKraft was not expected to win the 2011 U.S. Amateur. The heavy favorite that year was the top-ranked amateur, Patrick Cantlay. Kraft, although highly credentialed at SMU – he was a three-time Conference USA Player of the Year – was a surprise finalist. But that view changed when Kraft knocked off Cantlay, 2 up, in August at Erin Hills. \nHe was immediately invited to join the Walker Cup team, as was Spieth. The win also gave Kraft spots in the Masters, the U.S. Open and the Open Championship that next year. Kraft opted to keep his amateur status instead of attending Q-school. He wanted to play at Augusta National, his “holy grail” of courses. \nHe made the cut, finished 62nd and then turned pro, foregoing his invites to the other two majors. Time to start dominating the PGA TOUR. Or so he thought. \n“I thought because I won the U.S. Amateur, I was just ready to kind of jump right onto the PGA TOUR and start winning tournaments here too,” Kraft said. “But the bottom line is I needed to learn how to hit in the fairway more often. I’m not a super-long player but I wasn’t that accurate either. You can’t play out of the rough on the PGA TOUR.” \nKraft made eight starts through sponsor’s exemptions and won just $24,994. He joined the Web.com Tour the next season and made just over $170,000 the next two years. His first pro win came in 2015 at the Chitimacha Louisiana Open, and he finally earned his TOUR card for 2016. \nHis golf game seemed to be progressing but more at a snail’s pace than meteoric rise. That’s no surprise. \n“I’m kind of a slow starter,” Kraft said. “I was a slow starter in college and kept getting better every year. I’m a pro now for four years and I feel like I’m getting better every year. I got a taste of the PGA TOUR in 2012 but I wasn’t ready for it. I spent two years on the Web.com Tour and really learned how to play golf.” \nMeanwhile, he also needed to learn how to practice. He admits that in many of his practice sessions, he would “mindlessly go hit golf balls, chip for a minute, putt and go play. There was no purpose to it.” \nBut his current team has him focused. His swing coach is Troy Denton, who also works with another past U.S. Amateur champ, Ryan Moore. His strategy/performance coach is Josh Gregory, the former coach at SMU. His long-time trainer is Damon Goddard, who also works with Spieth. \nThen a few months ago, he started working with celebrated short-game instructor Dave Stockton. Kraft had been seeing another putting coach, but felt like he needed “a little something else to get me going.” So he called Stockton, then met with him for sessions at Sea Island last fall and Palm Springs last month. \nKraft already has noticed a difference in his putting. \n“It really helped turn the corner,” he said. “He helped free me up. I was getting a little too locked up over the ball on my stroke. Now I’m just reacting to the putt, seeing the ball go into the hole. \n“I’m not so conscious about how I stroke it. Now I just focus on where I’m gonna roll the ball. It’s a little different mindset in putting. It’s a little more of an art form now.” \nThe fledgling artist still has a ways to go before he can catch the master, Spieth. Kraft made a push to chase down Jordan Spieth Sunday, but came up short. (Harry How/Getty Images) \nKraft is 28 and still searching for his first PGA TOUR win. His $777,600 paycheck on Sunday nearly matches the $892,676 he won in his first 111 starts combined on the PGA TOUR and Web.com Tour. \nSpieth is 23, just won for the ninth time on TOUR, and already has two majors. His first-place paycheck of just under $1.3 million at Pebble Beach pushed him over the $28 million mark in career earnings – and that doesn’t include the $10 million bonus he won as FedExCup champ in 2015. \nAsked what he thinks the difference is between them, Kraft said it’s mostly mental. \n“He really just seems to be a gamer out there and I’m trying to get to that point,” Kraft said. “But I’m gonna keep plugging away, trying to get better. Hopefully one day I’ll be there. \n“He seems to be really comfortable when he’s in the hunt and coming down the stretch. Last week, I was there and I was totally calm. I wasn’t nervous at all. It was nice to see myself handle it like that. I think going forward that will give me confidence whenever I get back in that position.” \nKraft has changed his competitive mindset. Previously, he was so caught up in his playing status and in looking at the big picture that it negatively affected him. He remembers last fall when he didn’t have the necessary priority ranking to get into the OHL Classic at Mayakoba. In the past, he would have “freaked out a little bit.” \nInstead, he took it in stride, played the next week at The RSM Classic and tied for 21st. \nIn narrowing his focus, Kraft has raised his consistency level – as well as his confidence level. He’s never felt better about his game, even when he won the U.S. Amateur. \n“It’s probably as high as it’s ever been for him,” said Brittain, who was on the bag that week at Erin Hills, site of this year’s U.S. Open. “The way the season has unfolded, he’s been more consistent. That’s what we wanted at the start of the year. He just looks comfortable out there now.” \nHe certainly looked comfortable when he reduced Spieth’s lead from six to three shots through the first nine holes at Pebble Beach. Although he couldn’t maintain the momentum on the more difficult back nine, Kraft never wavered either, maintaining his string of pars to secure second. In a field that included not only Spieth and Johnson but world No. 1 Jason Day and four-time Pebble Beach champ Phil Mickelson, it was a heady result. \n“He knows he can with the guys out here,” Brittain said. “He feels like he belongs. … Kelly knows when he plays well, he can play with Jordan.” \nIndeed, Kraft had actually beaten Spieth earlier that week in a friendly foursomes match with fellow pros. Whenever the two are back home, they try to meet up for practice rounds with other pros from the Dallas area. That allows Kraft to appreciate Spieth’s golfing ability while also getting the opportunity to see how his own game measures up. \n“If Jordan Spieth doesn’t play last week, I win a golf tournament,” Kraft said. “A lot of guys can say that about tournaments, but I beat a lot of good players. I feel like my game’s in a good spot to win a golf tournament right now and hopefully I can put something together while I’m still hot.” \nOn Tuesday, Kraft ran into Spieth at Riviera. The good vibes from Pebble Beach had drifted all the way down to Los Angeles. “It’s pretty cool when you’ve got somebody that you put work in together and we can finish 1-2 in a TOUR event,” Spieth said. “It’s awesome. And I know that our teams were excited about it too. … I’ve never seen him smile so big.” \nLater that day during his practice round, Kraft played a few holes with Johnson. While on the 10th hole, they discussed the $144K putt. Johnson said a few people have asked him – jokingly, he presumes – if he missed that putt on purpose to help out a less-established player who’s trying to make an impact on TOUR. Johnson said absolutely not. \nAfter all, Kelly Kraft’s game is trending up now. Acts of kindness are no longer necessary.
