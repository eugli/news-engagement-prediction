Tigard Top247 athlete Braden Lenzy . \nThe 6-foot, 175-pound Lenzy is a receiver all the way for the Irish, who creep closer to Penn State for the No. 1 class in the 247Sports Recruiting Rankings . \nLenzy is a legit speed guy who as a sophomore last spring ran under 11 seconds in the 100-meter dash and under 22 seconds in the 200-meter dash. He has the type of ability to perhaps return the opening kick against Michigan for a touchdown on Sept. 1, 2018. \nIn Lenzy, Notre Dame is getting a take the top off the defense player, with tremendous room to grow physically. The yards after catch ability is evident, not just because of Lenzy’s wheels, but the physicality and mindset he brings with the football in his hands. \nRanked by the industry-generated 247Sports Composite as the nation’s No. 10 athlete and No. 177 prospect overall, Lenzy was also receiving looks as a cornerback. A fluid competitor that will bring plenty of versatility to South Bend. \nLenzy chose ND over an offer list that included Oregon, Stanford and USC. He’s commit No. 11 in joining perhaps the top quarterback prospect in the land Phil Jurkovec among others. Lenzy is one of five to rank in the Top10 of his respective position group. \nNotre Dame’s roster is full of playmakers heading into the 2017 season, and looking down the road with guys like Lenzy and Jafar Armstrong who signed earlier this month, Brian Kelly and company are adding to it.
