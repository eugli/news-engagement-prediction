Share via Twitter Kevin Mazur/WireImage/Getty Images In his Super Bowl LI performance, singer Luke Bryan put a country spin on the national anthem—impressing everyone who tuned in. Bryan sang the classic song ahead of the big game between the New England Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons, and he didn't miss a note. Bryan had the whole stadium swooning and cheering as he sang \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" which has become a rite of passage for established artists. Luke Bryan's performance of the national anthem at the Super Bowl comes on the heels of this year's halftime performer Lady Gaga , who handled the classic last year at the game. Before Gaga, Idina Menzel sang the song in 2014,—following in the footsteps of legendary artists like Alicia Keys , Christina Aguilera, Destiny's Child, Mariah Carey , Cher, and perhaps most famously, Whitney Houston. Bryan is the first country artist, however, to sing the national anthem at the Super Bowl since Carrie Underwood did so in 2010. Watch his country rendition below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T07:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T03:15:13.553+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
