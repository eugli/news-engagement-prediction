He was able to run and go through drill work but wore a black, non-contact jersey for most of spring ball. \nIn his first season as a full-time starter Smith had a breakout season. He registered 95 total tackles, five tackles for a loss, three quarterback hurries and a pair of forced fumbles in 13 games. \nWith Smith out Natrez Patrick (junior) and Reggie Carter (senior) will get the lion's share of the first-team reps at inside linebacker. Juwan Taylor (junior), Jaleel Laguins (sophmore), Tae Crowder (sophomore) and Monty Rice (freshman) will battle for playing time behind those two. \n(What's next for the Bulldogs?
