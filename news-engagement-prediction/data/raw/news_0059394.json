'Exotic pet trade' \nPrized for their distinctive gold and black shells, they fetch \"exceptionally high prices on the international black market\", a spokesman said. \nEfforts to steal the animals are so relentless there may only be 500 left, making it one of the rarest animals in the world, he added. Image copyright Chester Zoo Image caption Prized for their distinct shells, the tortoises are said to fetch high prices on the black market \nDr Garcia said there was a \"very real possibility the species could be lost forever due to illegal trafficking for the exotic pet trade\". \n\"Most of these illegally exported tortoises are sold in markets in South East Asia,\" he explained. \nThe quartet were part of a shipment of 13 being smuggled from Madagascar and will form part of the European Breeding Programme for the species. \nThey are going on display at the zoo to raise awareness of the illegal exotic pet trade. \nWorth Â£15bn ($19bn) a year, it is the fourth biggest international crime after drugs, arms and human trafficking, a zoo spokesman said.
