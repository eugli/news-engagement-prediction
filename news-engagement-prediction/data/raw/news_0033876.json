And the Aussies have shown their liking for the spinner. Some serious areas from young gun Mitch Swepson! pic.twitter.com/AbP5CkxBTu \n— cricket.com.au (@CricketAus) February 8, 2017 \nIn his 14 First-class matches, the leg spinner has taken 41 wickets, and is traveling with the Steve Smith's team. \nA glimpse of his quality was on display in Dubai, where the Aussies are holding the preparatory camp ahead of the India series. \nIn all probability, he is likely to play in the India series, which starts in Pune on February 23.
