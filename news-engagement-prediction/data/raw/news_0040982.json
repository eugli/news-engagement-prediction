What branch is currently being checked, or might be checked in the future, and why? Then, the class can share the various examples cited and discuss what each example reveals about how well our system of checks and balances works. Students can also look at the relationship between the White House and Congress, now that both the executive and legislative branches are controlled by the same party. How much should the American people expect a Republican Congress to hold a Republican president accountable if his actions or policies cross the line? For example this editorial argues that it’s time for Congress to investigate, based on currently breaking news stories about the relationship between members of Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign and Russian officials. What do you think Congress’s role should be? \nAdvertisement Additional questions students can consider about the U.S.’s system of checks and balances include: • To what extent is it clouded by politics? • Is it effective at stopping overreaches of power? • Is it fair and reliable? Part II: Consider the Value of a Free Press as a “Fourth Branch” of Government Photo Related Article Credit Illustration by Pablo Delcan; Photo by Doug Mills/The New York Times While the federal government only includes three branches, students can consider the role a free press plays in our system of checks and balances. In fact, the press is sometimes referred to as the “ fourth branch ” of government. Ask students: Why is the news media so important in helping to maintain the balance of power in the American political system? To emphasize the value of the press, you might invite students to work in pairs or groups with a recent New York Times front page . Ask them, what articles or images from that day’s front page would probably not be published in a country without a law guaranteeing freedom of the press? Then, invite them to take a marker and draw an X over each of those. To push the discussions a bit further, students might use our “ C ensoring the P ress” handout before small groups share their ideas. You could even do this activity over the course of a week and create a gallery of such pages. Or, use this 63-page New York Times Curriculum Guide on Checks and Balances (PDF), which includes three lesson plans on the importance of a free press, as well as additional lessons and student handouts relating to our system of checks and balances. Then, invite students to investigate President Trump’s relationship with the role of the free press. During his first full day in office, Mr. Trump called journalists “among the most dishonest human beings on earth.” His chief White House strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, stated , “The media should be embarrassed and humiliated and keep its mouth shut and just listen for a while.” He continued, “The media here is the opposition party. They don’t understand this country. They still do not understand why Donald Trump is the president of the United States.” What other evidence of the relationship between the press and the president can students find? For instance, why does the Mr. Trump call CNN and other mainstream news outlets, “fake news” ? \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Read the Op-Ed “ Don’t Expect the First Amendment to Protect the Media ” by the law professors RonNell Andersen Jones and Sonja R. West. Why do they think Americans should be worried about the power of the news media during the Trump administration? Do you agree? Have actions by the Trump White House supported or undermined their central claim? Part I I I: Investigate President Trump’s Executive Orders Photo President Trump with an executive order on Jan. 25 calling for the construction of a Mexican border wall. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times While students might be familiar with the concept that Congress makes the laws and the president enforces them, they might be confused by the concept of an executive order. It’s not a presidential power typically emphasized in school textbooks. With President Trump’s executive orders making headlines at the start of his new administration, students may want to know, how does this action fit into the system of separation of powers? The American Bar Association defines an executive order as: \nAn executive order is a signed, written, and published directive from the President of the United States that manages operations of the federal government. In other words, the president is defining the details of how he will enforce the law as already written. To give one example, Congress might declare war on another nation, but the president as Commander in Chief has broad authority in determining how to wage that war. The same principle is true for Congressional laws on anything else — for example, education, energy policy or immigration. The bar association’s explanation continues: \nExecutive orders are not legislation; they require no approval from Congress, and Congress cannot simply overturn them. Congress may pass legislation that might make it difficult, or even impossible, to carry out the order, such as removing funding. Only a sitting U.S. President may overturn an existing executive order by issuing another executive order to that effect. President Trump is not unique in issuing a flurry of executive orders in his first days in office . President Obama acted similarly . And neither is it unique for an opposition party to criticize a president’s use of executive orders to make policy. Republicans continually criticized President Obama for his use of executive orders, calling him a dictator who abused his power. In 2012, Donald Trump even scolded Mr. Obama for using executive orders to make “major power grabs of authority.” Why is @BarackObama constantly issuing executive orders that are major power grabs of authority? This is the latest — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 10, 2012 Even though the president has the power to issue executive orders that have the force of law, the president must always cite what specific laws — or the Constitution itself — grant him the authority to issue his order. In addition, these orders are reviewable by the federal courts. To learn more about how the president sets policy using executive orders, students can visit the Federal Register. All executive orders, by law, must be published in the Federal Register (the list includes presidential memorandums and proclamations as well). Working in pairs, students can pick an executive action Mr. Trump has taken and determine the following: • What policy change is the president ordering the federal government to make? (Students might find some of the legal jargon challenging, but they can still try to figure out what policy change the president is making.) • What authority does the president cite for issuing this executive order? (President John F. Kennedy issued an executive order in 1962 that requires all executive orders to contain a citation of the authority under which it is issued. Executive orders generally begin with the phrase “By the authority vested in me as President of the United States by…”) \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story • By searching in The New York Times, Google News and other sources what can you find out about how the public and the media reacted to the executive order? Did it make headlines? What has been the reception? Is it being challenged in any way via the system of checks and balances? • What’s your personal reaction to the executive order? Does it seem important? Does it seem like good public policy? Pairs can share what they learned through their research and discuss their opinions of these presidential actions. Part IV: Evaluating the Relationship Between the President and the Judiciary Video Judge Robart Rules on Immigration Ban On Friday, Judge James Robart of Federal District Court in Seattle declared that “there’s no support” for the administration’s argument that “we have to protect the U.S. from individuals” from seven predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Syria, Iraq, Somalia, Yemen, Sudan and Libya. By UNITED STATES COURTS on Publish Date February 4, 2017. Photo by United States Courts. Watch in Times Video » embed One of the most important checks on a president’s authority is the judicial branch’s power to review the constitutionality of executive actions. The power of judicial review, affirmed by the Supreme Court in Marbury v. Madison in 1803 , came into full public view in early February when first a federal district judge , and then a federal appeals court , suspended Mr. Trump’s executive order banning immigration from seven largely-Muslim nations and halting the immigration of all refugees to the U.S. Students can watch Judge James Robart of Federal District Court in Seattle deliver his opinion in the five-minute video above, and then discuss what they noticed about his justification for suspending the president’s executive order, including how he described his role within our system of checks and balances. President Trump is not the first president to have his policy actions stymied by the courts. President Obama was publicly disappointed when the courts blocked his executive order aiming to shield as many as five million undocumented immigrants from deportation. President Franklin D. Roosevelt criticized the Supreme Court when it blocked parts of his New Deal program during the Great Depression. But President Trump’s public contempt for the judicial branch and his denigration of specific judges who hand down rulings unfavorable to him seem to be breaking new ground in the relationship between the executive and judicial branches. \nPresident Trump is barreling into a confrontation with the courts barely two weeks after taking office, foreshadowing years of legal battles as an administration determined to disrupt the existing order presses the boundaries of executive power. The article continues: \nLawyers and lawmakers of both parties said Mr. Trump’s comments reflected a lack of respect for the constitutional system of checks and balances. \nLate in the day, Mr. Trump took to Twitter to pre-emptively blame the judge and the judiciary for what the president suggested would be a future terrorist attack. The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Feb. 4, 2017 Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Feb. 5, 2017 Students should take notes while listening to this NPR story (the “play” button is on the top left of the article) pointing out that Mr. Trump’s criticism of judges and the judiciary is out of line with past presidents. Then they should consider the following questions: • Is President Trump promoting a lack of respect for the court system with his comments? • Are Mr. Trump’s public statements about judges and the judiciary branch weakening our system of checks and balances? Why or why not? \nAdvertisement • Or, should his statements not be taken so seriously? • Has more recent news continued Mr. Trump’s strained relationship with the judicial branch? Explain. After writing about or discussing the above questions, students can imagine they are a legal adviser to President Trump. What advice would they give the president about how our system of checks and balances is supposed to work, and what role he as president should have within that system. Photo A Feb. 7 cartoon by Patrick Chappatte titled “Trump vs. the Judges,” with the caption “The Justice Department has urged a federal appeals court to reinstate the travel ban.” Finally, students can create their own editorial cartoons , like the one above by Patrick Chappatte , about any of the topics discussed in this lesson. They can even submit it to our annual editorial cartoon contest (see our contest calendar for details).
