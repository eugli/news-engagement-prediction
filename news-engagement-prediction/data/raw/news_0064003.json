Ulster Secretary James Brokenshire spoke out as he faced growing calls to prevent retired troops facing a ‘witch-hunt’ some 40 years after they battled terrorism. He was urged to act after it emerged the Police Service of Northern Ireland’s (PSNI) taxpayer-funded Legacy Investigation Branch (LIB) was re-examining 302 deaths by UK troops during the Troubles. It could result in up to 1,000 veterans being investigated as potential murder suspects over actions they took decades ago at the height of the IRA’s terror campaign. Critics are angry that 90 per cent of the 3,500 killings in Northern Ireland were terrorist-related – but the PSNI’s focus has been on deaths at the hands of British security forces. In a passionate Commons debate yesterday, the Democratic Unionist Party demanded measures to ensure ex-soldiers would not face probes into their actions if they have already been investigated. Mr Brokenshire said he recognised concerns that inquiries in Northern Ireland were disproportionately to do with cases allegedly involving the army.
