She died in 1996 at age 79.\nIt's these facts along with lyric interpretation that Callaway said she enjoys sharing with her audience. She also likes to engage with concertgoers by bantering with people in the front row.\n\"People relate to this music on so many levels because there are interpretations and arrangements that are never done twice,\" Callaway said. \"Jazz music is like an apple cut off a branch. It's juicy and fresh because it's in the moment.\"\nClosing the opening night will be a concert honoring drummer Frankie Capp and his Juggernaut Big Band with special guest Butch Miles.\nFriday evening (Feb. 24) will feature four concerts beginning with Hamilton & Hamilton, with tenor saxophonist Scott Hamilton and the Jeff Hamilton Trio.\nThe second show, \"The Solo, Duo, Trio & Beyond,\" will showcase musicians Shelly Berg, Chuck Berghofer, Gilbert Castellanos, Francisco Torres, Don Shelton and Dough Webb, while the third concert will bring lyricist Alan Bergman to the stage, backed by the Tamir Hendelman duo.\nGordon Goodwin's Big Phat Band will close the evening with special set, \"A Salute to the Great Composers and Arrangers,\" with Sammy Nestico and Tom Kubis.\nSaturday evening (Feb. 25) will open with the Akiko Tsuruga Trio featuring organist Akiko, Jeff Hamilton and guitarist Graham Dechter, followed by a salute to \"Jazz at the Philharmonic.\"\nJohn Clayton, Larry Fullter and Jeff Hamilton will present \"Tribute to the Ray Brown Trio,\" and the evening will conclude with a tribute to Frank Sinatra Jr. with the Frank Sinatra Jr. Orchestra, conducted by Terry Woodson. The concert will feature special guest vocalist Steve Tyrell.\nThe series will come to a close Feb. 26 with \"A Weekend for the Love of Jazz and Big Bands,\" starting with the Houston Person Quartet, followed by a concert featuring \"Mays at the Movies,\" another show with The Larry Fuller Trio, and finally concluding with the Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra.\nFeb. 25 and Feb. 26 will offer a Champagne jazz brunch. The daily evening concerts will take place in the hotel's Grand Pacific Ballroom, and some afternoon concerts will be interspersed through the grounds near the pool.\nCallaway said it's an honor to perform during the jazz celebration and help introduce crowds to the jazz greats like Fitzgerald, who had a troubled childhood but overcame the struggles and found comfort as well as success in her musical artistry.\n\"Every one of us has talent, and it's my hope that the audience takes away a sense of joy and humanity and a greater and renewed appreciation of the artist,\" Callaway said. \"It's a reminder of what we can do for our lives and that we too can live courageously.\"\n*\nIF YOU GO\nWhat: 17th annual Newport Beach Jazz Party & Big Band Blowout\nWhen: Feb. 23 through Feb. 26\nWhere: Newport Beach Marriott Hotel & Spa, 900 Newport Center Drive\nCost: $30 to $485\nInformation: (949) 759-5003 or newportbeachjazzparty.com\nkathleen.luppi@latimes.com\nTwitter: @KathleenLuppi", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbas.com/jive/prod/lanews/stylesheets/fonts.1q2w3_1477f3b552599ac1d39c4f798c7e232c.min.css", "http://newportbeachjazzparty.com/", "https://d2ne9hs4xtfl62.cloudfront.net/v2/js/subscribe_form.js", "https://twitter.com/KathleenLuppi"], "published": "2017-02-17T19:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T03:26:56.887+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
