The AIIMS administration has taken this incident very seriously and had yesterday (Sunday) suspended five resident doctors in this regard,” said Amit Gupta, spokesperson AIIMS, “However, no decision has been taken regarding the suspension of the resident doctors. That situation remains status quo,” added Gupta. \nYou may also like to watch \nEarlier in a statement, the RDA president Vjay Gurjar had said the AIIMS administration had considered their demands and order of suspension has been “revoked with immediate effect”. \nHis statement came after RDA held a meeting with AIIMS administration and Nurses union over the issue. \nRajbir Kaur, a nurse with AIIMS, died on Saturday during delivery through caesarean section. \nKaur suffered a cardiac arrest during the surgery, leading to death. \nFollowing the controversy, an eight-member enquiry committee was set up under the chairmanship of senior faculty S.C. Sharma and Medical Superintendent D.K. Sharma. \nThe committee also has two members from outside AIIMS. It is to submit its report on February 15.
