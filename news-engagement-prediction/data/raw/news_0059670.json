Maxine Waters (D., Calif.) said Tuesday evening that several aides and advisers to President Donald Trump are part of a \"Kremlin Clan\" because of their Russian ties, calling them a \"bunch of scumbags.\" \nWaters first appeared to call White House chief of staff Reince Priebus \"Mike Priebus\" before criticizing Trump and many his current and former aides for their ties to Russia during an appearance on MSNBC's \"All In With Chris Hayes.\" \nWaters first said that Priebus cannot continue to defend Trump. \n\"He can't continue to try to defend this president, who is entangled with this Kremlin clan of his, while they are all seeking really to get rid of these sanctions that are placed on Russia because all of them are connected to the oil and gas industry,\" Waters said. \nWaters mentioned several figures tied to Trump in her comments, including former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, former campaign manager Paul Manafort, Carter Page, Roger Stone, Secretary of Commerce nominee Wilbur Ross, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Only Tillerson currently has a position in the Trump administration, and Ross may be in the Cabinet if he is confirmed by the Senate. \nThree Democratic senators and one Independent voted to confirm Tillerson earlier this month, along with unanimous Republican support. \n\"This Kremlin clan is all about getting the oil and gas money and doing the drilling, and they need this president,\" Waters said. \"They need this president to get these sanctions lifted.\" \n\"It's clear to me, and I just think the American people had better understand what's going on,\" Waters continued. \"This is a bunch of scumbags. That's what they are.\" \nWhen host Chris Hayes asked Waters to clarify her remarks, Waters again said that they are scumbags. Hayes asked if that label included Tillerson, to which Waters said that Tillerson's job is to get sanctions on Russia lifted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:19:36.451+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
