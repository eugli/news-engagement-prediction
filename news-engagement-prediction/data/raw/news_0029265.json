The suspect was arrested in Las Palmas, the capital of Gran Canaria. Another suspect has also been arrested in Bilbao. Police said the Moroccan supported ISIS and the use of extreme violence and openly hated Western culture. The warnings were reportedly found on social media amid fears the terror group is also recruiting translators and foreign jihadists from the country (file picture) 'The arrested person constituted a potential threat to national security, having expressed his clear intention to carry out a terrorist attack of great magnitude and repercussion,' said the spokesman. The investigation revealed that he also carried out extensive activity in social networks, through which he published jihadist content in support of ISIS, shared violent videos praising martyrdom and openly approved the commission of terrorist attacks. He even posed together with his wife and young son wearing clothes with emblems of the terrorist organisation whilst holding guns. The Moroccan tried to hide his identity using various methods in order to avoid police detectoin, unaware that he was already being watched.

The official document claims 'ISIS has been publishing in Spanish, which means an increase in the risk of its influence on radicals living in our country'. And it states that last year 'Daesh launched a campaign to hire Spanish translators, which suggests a growing interest in attracting Spanish-speaking foreign fighters.' In January 2016, ISIS issued a chilling video threat to launch terror attacks in Spain, declaring: 'We will recover our land from the invaders.' Spain is currently level four on the anti-terror alert â€“ the same ranking as the UK. Around 15 million of the 65 million foreign tourists that flock to Spain every year are British. A Foreign Office spokesman pointed to its own official travel advice for the country, telling MailOnline this morning: 'Our online travel advice contains thorough information on staying safe abroad, including terrorism threats, and we keep it under constant review.'
