I believe, in the coming days, the Security Council itself does intend to visit Nigeria and see for itself the humanitarian situation and evaluate it first-hand. \n“The Security Council will be going to Nigeria to assess the humanitarian situation caused by Boko Haram. The visit will be coming up in March.” \nMeanwhile, UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, Edward Kallon, said at a breakfast meeting in Abuja, yesterday, that insurgency in the North-East would be over in the next 18 months. \nKallon, who described the crisis as the fourth largest in the world, said challenges confronting Nigeria were enormous, ranging from security to governance and economy. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T09:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T04:27:09.659+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
