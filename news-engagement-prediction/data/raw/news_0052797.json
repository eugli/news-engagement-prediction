Tories’ bid for UK Bill of Rights declared 'dead' after review ends \n​Brexit is unlikely to take place until 2019; another general election is due to take place in 2020. \nThe 2010 Coalition agreement said the Government would investigate the creation of the new bill. In 2012, however, a commission set by the Government failed to reach unanimous conclusions and the idea was kicked into the long grass. \nThe proposal was resurrected before the 2015 general election and Mr Cameron’s majority Conservative government said it was committed to the idea but consistently refused to publish a timescale. \nNow the plan has been delayed again because the Government wants to only “do one constitutional reform at a time”. \nMs Truss said in an interview with Parliament’s The House magazine: “Given that we are leaving the European Union and we will have the Great Repeal Bill going through parliament, clearly that is going to signify a major constitutional change.

It’s important we only do one constitutional reform at a time.\" \nMs Truss's announcement confirms reports that Downing Street sources believed the Government currently has too much on its place to implement the bill. \nIn April last year Theresa May, then Home Secretary, said Britain should withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights, arguing that it “adds nothing to our prosperity”.
