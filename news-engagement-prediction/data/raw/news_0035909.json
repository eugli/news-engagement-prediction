As police investigated, the wallaby's owner called to report their missing pet around 1:30 p.m. Thursday.\nNative to Australia, wallabies are in the same family as kangaroos but typically only grow to a height of between 30 and 100 centimetres, while kangaroos can reach as tall as two metres.\nIt is legal to own a pet wallaby in British Columbia, as they are not on the province's list of 1,000 Controlled Alien Species .\nRCMP Cpl. Holly Largy said the furry escapee is \"friendly, but very timid\" and may be scared after finding itself in an unfamiliar setting.\nPolice are asking anyone who spots the wallaby to call them directly at 604-532-3200 so officers can send someone to wrangle it.\n\"CORRECTION\" Missing Wallaby, similar to picture from 22200 block of 56th ave.
