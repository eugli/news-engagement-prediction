Photo-Features.co.uk 6 Stephanie met Ciaron when she was just 16 and the pair soon fell head over heels for one another \nStephanie, now 24, said: “Watching Corrie’s girlfriend on TV takes me back to the agonising early days after Ciaron’s disappearance in March 2011. \n“I felt shock, bewilderment and disbelief that somebody so young and vibrant could vanish without a trace.” \nStephanie was just 16 when she met Ciaron, a soldier in the army. Photo-Features.co.uk 6 Although it has been six years since Ciaron disappeared, Stephanie is still hoping for a breakthrough \nThe pair were head over heels for each other and, after only a few months together, Ciaron left the army and moved in with Steph at her mum’s house in Manchester. \nAfter a year together, Ciaron proposed to an overjoyed Stephanie. \nAlthough the pair were madly in love, Steph openly admits that their relationship was often fraught with rows. \nOne day, Stephanie found texts to another woman on Ciaron’s phone, who swore that they were innocent. \nDistraught and young and in love, Stephanie decided to get her own back. \nShe said: “I wanted to hurt him. We broke up and I started seeing someone else. \n“When I met Ciaron to pick up some stuff I’d left at his house, we kissed. \n“It seemed like nothing could keep us apart. \n“Afterwards he called and said, ‘We’re meant to be together. I’ll never leave you, Steph.’ \n“Thinking we had all the time in the world, I refused to get back with him.” Photo-Features.co.uk Ciaron went missing while the couple were on a break, and he has never been found Photo-Features.co.uk Stephanie was close to Ciaron’s mum, Ann-Marie, pictured left, but she died just a few weeks shy of the fifth anniversary of her son’s death RELATED STORIES mum wants CORRIE closure Mum of missing Corrie McKeague says there's a 'good possibility' of finding him at landfill site DIGGING FOR CLUES Diggers start to shift 8,000 tonnes of waste so cops can search landfill for RAF gunner Corrie McKeague FAMILY'S ANGUISH Brother of missing RAF man Corrie McKeague admits having 'dark days' as he continues desperate search 'THINGS GOT HEATED' Dad of missing RAF man Corrie McKeague has lost contact with his two other sons after bitter rows \nBut just weeks later, Stephanie found out that Ciaron had gone missing. \nAt first, Ciaron’s nearest and dearest thought he was with friends but, as time passed, it became clear that something was seriously wrong. \nAll of Ciaron’s bank cards and social media hadn’t been used or touched since his disappearance – just like Corrie’s . \nWeeks flew by and turned into months and still no one heard from Ciaron. \nStephanie said: “Ciaron would never have voluntarily been away that long. \n“I posted on Facebook telling him to throw stones at my window, something he usually did after we rowed. \n“Every night I fell asleep waiting.” \nBut Ciaron never turned up.
