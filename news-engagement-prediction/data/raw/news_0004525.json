Read More Fighting back In his first ever interview with the media, the group's leader, Atah Ullah, says they decided to fight back against the government after 70 years of repression. \"We, the vulnerable and persecuted people, have asked the international community for protection against the atrocities by the government of Myanmar, but the international community turned its back on us,\" Atah Ullah says in an exclusive interview obtained by CNN. \"Finally, we cannot take it anymore.\" Who are the Rohingya? \nThe Rohingya are a stateless Muslim minority in Myanmar's Rakhine state thought to number about one million people Myanmar does not recognize them as citizens or one of the 135 recognized ethnic groups living in the country Much of this is rooted in their heritage in East Bengal, now called Bangladesh Though many Rohingya have only known life in Myanmar, they are widely viewed as intruders from across the border According to Human Rights Watch, laws discriminate against the Rohingya, infringing on their freedom of movement, education, and employment They are denied land and property rights and ownership, and land on which they live can be taken away at any given time An estimated one million Muslim Rohingyas live in Rakhine State, where they are a persecuted, stateless ethnic minority in Buddhist-majority Myanmar. The government of Myanmar, also known as Burma, does not officially recognize the Rohingya, regarding them as illegal immigrants from neighboring Bangladesh, despite many being able to trace their roots back in Myanmar for generations. \"In the October 9th attack, we did not have any sophisticated weapons,\" Atah Ullah says. \"We attacked them using our machetes, swords, and knives, and we seized their weapons to use against them.\" In response, the Myanmar military launched what it calls \"clearance operations\" in the Rohingya villages to find the suspects involved in the attack, and to retrieve their weapons. In early November, the military deployed helicopters which opened fire during clashes with Rohingya militants. State media reports that in the process, more than 100 Rohingyas described as \"violent attackers\" have been killed, although activists tell CNN the number is far higher. Nearly 500 Rohingyas have also been arrested. To escape the violence, at least 69,000 people have fled across the border to Bangladesh, the latest figures from the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) show. Tales of misery Many of the refugees arriving in Bangladesh, including several who spoke to CNN, have reported mass killings, rapes and burning of villages by government forces. \"The military took away my son,\" says Hamid Hossain, a refugee in Teknaf, Bangladesh. \"The military took away 89 boys from our villages.\" \"The military has been torturing us since 2012. They are killing Rohingyas and raping women,\" he says. CNN cannot independently verify the accounts from inside Rakhine State, because access to journalists and aid agencies is heavily restricted. Amnesty International says the government's actions \"may amount to crimes against humanity.\" Yanghee Lee, the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights, visited Myanmar last month and said she saw with her \"own eyes\" the burnt houses in Rakhine State. In a news conference in Yangon at the end of the trip, she concluded that if the population felt like the new government was \"addressing their situation,\" then \"extreme elements would not have easily been able to hijack their cause.\" She added that the government's response seems to be to \"defend, dismiss and deny,\" and is \"counterproductive.\" In a 4,000-word written statement to CNN, Myanmar government spokesperson Aye Aye Soe denies human rights abuses. \"What is happening in Rakhine now is only security clearance sweeps being carried out with restraint and within rules and regulations against armed perpetrators,\" Aye Aye Soe says. \"The instigators are using this situation to portray a disproportionate picture of 'genocide' and 'ethnic cleansing.'\" JUST WATCHED", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T12:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T07:14:17.627+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
