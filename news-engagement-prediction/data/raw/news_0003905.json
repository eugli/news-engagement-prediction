Created by Hungarian designer Réka Neszmélyi and featuring a logo by Graz-based creative Ádám Katyi , the card’s simple design shows that you certainly do not need a lot to be going on to make a great impression. The simple layout of the card is paired with the stunning visual effect of reflective foil that covers a significant area—other than this patch of eye-catching metallic foil, you would only find the logo and an email address printed on the surface. Depending on the light and the angle from which you look at it, this gorgeous business card changes color to look new and different, surprising you with the shade that would appear next.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T23:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T09:31:34.428+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
