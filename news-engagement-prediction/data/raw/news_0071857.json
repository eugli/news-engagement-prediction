Early, Jr. said at a Thursday morning news conference. \nAuthorities do not yet have a name for this person. \nEarly described the development as “very significant” and said it was the result of a DNA profile and witness statements. \n“We’re very confident in the description that I’ve given you today that this is our person of interest,” he said. \nHe added that the DNA was not the same as the DNA in the case of Karina Vetrano , a jogger who was killed in New York City days before Marcotte, 27, died. (Police have accused a 20-year-old Brooklyn man of murder in Vetrano’s killing.) Vanessa Marcotte David L. Ryan/The Boston Globe/Getty \nEarly said the person of interest was driving a dark-colored SUV in the area of Marcotte’s death about the time she was reported missing in Princeton, Massachusetts. \nShe was found dead on Aug. 7, 2016, near Brooks Station Road in Princeton, just a few hours after her family said she went for a jog. Her body was stripped and had burn marks, according to authorities, though her cause of death has not been released. \nMarcotte lived in N.Y.C. but returned to Massachusetts for a visit, officials said. A 2011 alum of Boston University, she grew up in nearby Leominster, Massachusetts. \n• Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

He said the DNA did not return a match in a federal database, though that does not mean the person of interest doesn’t have a criminal background. \n• Pick up PEOPLE’s special edition True Crime Stories: Cases That Shocked America , on sale now , for the latest on Casey Anthony, JonBenét Ramsey and more. \nAnyone with information is urged to call the Massachusetts State Police tip line, which is anonymous, at 508-453-7589. \n“If you think you have something, give us a call,” Early said. \nIn December, Marcotte’s family made a public plea for help in the case, saying then, “Not a day goes by we don’t reflect on the enormity of our loss.” Show Full Article", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:10:06.254+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
