The studios today revealed the Blu-ray trailer for the film, which announces that Rogue One will be available on Digital HD and Disney Movies Anywhere on March 24th, with a Blu-ray combo pack, DVD, and on demand release to follow on April 4th. \nThe bonus features for the home video release are extensive, as they were for Star Wars: The Force Awakens , but sadly they don’t include an audio commentary by director Gareth Edwards . Of course, Disney went the double-dipping route with Force Awakens and released a 3D Blu-ray that included an Abrams commentary later on, so it’s possible they’re saving Edwards’ commentary track for sometime down the road. \nCheck out the Blu-ray trailer below, followed by details on all the bonus features.
