Jeremy called Alan his favourite ever guest (Photo: ITV) He was a hit with the studio audience (Photo: ITV) \n\"I don't think she's as religious as maybe I might be,\" he said, as Jeremy couldn't resist praising him. \n\"You're my favourite guest in ages - I love you,\" he laughed. He certainly had charm (Photo: ITV) The lie detector test said Louise cheated on him (Photo: ITV) \nThe segment had both the audience and crew in stitches - particularly with Jeremy's puns as Alan said he thought Louise was a virgin when they met, \"but there was no hymen\". \nJez quipped: \"Isn't that what you sing in church?\" They're willing to work to get things back on track (Photo: ITV) \nGraham later joked to the host: \"You're obsessed with the hymen!\" \nAlthough Louise failed every lie detector test, the couple were ready to work hard for the sake of their relationship and family.
