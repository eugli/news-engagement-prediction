Holidaymakers this summer will see, for the first time, how the political turmoil, which overtook the world last year, will translate during their holidays. And, on most occasions, it won’t be for the better.\nThe crash in the price of sterling since the vote last June, coupled with the financial instability which continues following the election of Donald Trump, means the cost of foreign travel has been driven up for British tourists.\nIt is estimated that going abroad on holidays to Europe or the US will cost 15% more than last year.\nBut how can you avoid breaking the bank on your annual trip away?\nThe problem \nThe pound has plunged against the dollar since the 23 June referendum and there are fears it will drop even further given the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit deal and the negotiations which will start later this year.\nSterling stands at about £1.18 against the euro – a drop of more than 10p in the past year.\nOne way of illustrating this from the sun lounger is via the Post Office’s holiday cost barometer which tracks the prices of holiday extras such as alcohol, soft drinks and coffee, sun cream, insect repellent and a three-course meal for two.\nCompared with two years ago, these are 28% more in Orlando, Florida, averaging £81. In Nice, it is 41% more, or £91. In English Harbour, Antigua, the bill is almost £165, up 45%.\nAll is not lost, however, and foreign holidays are far from unaffordable.\nSome light \nBecause of hedging – a form of insurance against movements in the pound – this year’s prices will not reflect the full force of the pound’s drop. “Many travel agents have hedged their currency risk against potential Brexit volatility, or may pass the extra costs on to their suppliers, the hotels, resorts or airlines,” said Charles Purdy, chief executive of Smart Currency Exchange.\nTough economic climates stretch across the eurozone and local prices have been forced down to offset the dip in the pound.\n“Tourists and locals are watching their pennies and shops, restaurants, bars and hotels are responding to intense competition,” said Andrew Brown of Post Office travel money.\nGoing stateside \nThe pound has suffered its sharpest falls against the all-conquering dollar, crashing more than 17% from $1.49 before the referendum, to around $1.24 today.\nThis means that a plate of morning eggs in the local diner has gone up – as well the tax and tips which come as inevitable add-ons.\nSome respite can be found in the fact that the price of airfares and hotels at peak times appear to have dropped in the past two years due to competition between airlines and holiday firms.\n“Flights to Fort Lauderdale and Boston have fallen by almost a third, and to San Francisco by more than a quarter,” said Suzanne Perry, from travel site, Kayak.co.uk.\nLocal prices in popular destinations such as Orlando, Las Vegas and Boston have fallen by up to 10% compared with last summer, she said. “You can get rooms for under £150 a night, which isn’t likely to price-out Brits.”\nFlorida remains relatively affordable and crowd free, but only if you can go in September, October and November (avoiding UK half term). A 10-day break starts from £475 a person, including flights. Otherwise, Norwegian Airlines is planning to offer flights to New York from the summer for as little as £60.\nOld favourites \nAlthough the cost of a trip to the south of France has rocketed, some old favourites remain affordable.\nGreece remains cheap as it battles to attract much-needed tourist business to offset the poor economic climate. TravelSupermarket.com points to 10-day self-catering packages in Corfu or Zante in early June from around £190. “You can self-cater in Rhodes in June from £190 a person for a week including flights or go all-inclusive from £246,” says Emma Coulthurst from the site.\nSpain’s Costa Brava and Costa del Sol remain relatively affordable, even during the peak summer school holidays, when a family of four could get 10-nights self-catering and flights in Fuengirola from £273 a person, which falls to just £241 in the Algarve. The first or last weeks of the school holidays offer the best deals.\nAdam Walsh of holiday lettings company Interhome UK, says Portugal, Greece and Croatia offer better value than holidaying in the UK. “Flights remain competitively priced, while meals and drinks are also cheaper. Poland and the Czech Republic have beautiful countryside, few tourists and low prices,” he said.\nThere has been a surge in summer bookings as Britons seek to lock in prices ahead of anticipated further sterling volatility when Article 50 is triggered in March, he said.\nNot alone \nMany other countries are also suffering their own currency woes.\nMexico remains affordable as the peso has been hit by President Trump’s electoral threats about tougher tariffs and immigration restrictions.\n“Britons still have plenty of spending power in Caribbean coastal resorts such as Cancun, where a flight and room for a fortnight starts from £389 a person in March when you can expect near-perfect weather. A meal out , with drinks, is less than 300 pesos, or under £15,” said Coulthurst.\nRecent terror attacks in Istanbul have hit the Turkish tourist trade – a side effect is cheaper prices in unaffected resorts, with self-catering from £119 a person for a week in June, four-star all-inclusive packages from £178 or five-star from £280.\nMorocco has been relatively free of terrorism and still cheap, even though the pound has fallen 16% against the dirham since the referendum. Ten nights in Agadir with flights this June starts at around £145 per person.\nGoa, south India’s prime beach hotspot, is another low-cost option, with 10-day packages for less than £550 a person during peak season in March, according to TravelSupermarket.com.\nKeeping it simple \nThe New York Times recently advised US travellers to take advantage of weak sterling by holidaying in the UK. While there is not quite the same value for home-based tourists, there is some merit in not leaving the country. As Suzanne Perry says: “We have seen prices for four-star hotels in popular UK destinations fall by up to 10% compared to last year.”\nOld European favourites also offer possibilities. The pound is down around 12% against the Polish zloty since the referendum but Emma Coulthurst says cities such as Krakow, Warsaw and Wroclaw still offer great value, with a pint of beer costing around £1.50. “Low-cost airlines such as Ryanair, EasyJet and WizzAir make it possible to book three-nights with flights and accommodation for around £100 a head.”\nParis, often the shorthand for an expensive weekend away, can look affordable as Asian tourists steer clear due to terror fears. The cost of a two-night break, including flight and a three-star hotel, has fallen by half to around £108 a person, Coulthurst says.\nThe Post Office city costs barometer rates Warsaw as the best value for accommodation, meals, drinks, city transport and sightseeing, followed by Vilnius, Budapest, Riga, Kraków, Lisbon, Dubrovnik and Prague.\nGETTING THE MOST OUT OF MEXICO \nEmily Cook and her partner Mark Fallaize. \nWhen Emily Cook and her partner Mark Fallaize wanted to get the most for their money they settled on Mexico.\nDonald Trump’s threats to build a wall and slap tariffs on Mexican imports has hit the peso hard. Emily, 28, who works for a private health clinic, booked a break in the beach resort of Puerto Vallarta. “Sterling’s slump did play a part in the choice of destination,” Emily says. “We kept an eye on exchange rates to see where we could get most for our money, using the Post Office holiday costs barometer to work out which countries offered the best value.”\nFlights and 10-nights accommodation in an all-inclusive five-star hotel cost Emily and Mark, 40, around £1,700.\n“We took £1,000 spending money, including dollars for tips, but prices were so reasonable that we came back with around £300.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T14:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T09:18:34.428+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
