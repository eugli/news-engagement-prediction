Some 200 have died so far - but rescuers have managed to save at least 100 (Photo: AFP) \nLocal media reported on Friday that volunteers had managed to refloat some of the whales during high tide, but most were quickly restranded as the tide ebbed. \nRescuers took turns pouring water over the beached whales to try and keep them cool, while school children sang to soothe them.
