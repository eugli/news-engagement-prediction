'We had takeaways all the time, ordering up to four times a week. We would spend at least £20 a time but if we were ordering from Pizza Hut we would easily spend £40 or £50. But after being left embarrassed by photos from her holiday Chelsea joined Slimming World and lost almost six stone in 15 months Chelsea onced ate more than half a loaf of white bread, four chocolate bars and four packets of crisps a day, weighing in at 14st 7lbs During her holiday last year Chelsea wore a bikini and shorts for the first time in her life 'We would buy a large pizza or meal each, an extra meal to share, all the sides we wanted and desserts too. 'We wasted a lot of money on takeaways - it is shocking to think about now. 'Once Matt had gone to work at night I would think nothing of eating four chocolate bars or making cheese on toast and sandwiches on thick white bread. 'I was always snacking and had no proper routine at all. I never did exercise. Everything I ate was unhealthy and I could eat and eat and never feel sick. Chelsea enjoyed home-cooked meals when she lived with her parents but said when she lost her routine as a student and moved in with railway worker husband Matt Chelsea also has polycystic ovary syndrome, a symptom of which is weight gain so the odds were up against her 'I was completely addicted to takeaways and whenever I had a meal I would always follow it with crisps and chocolate because I craved it and once I had one I always had to have the other. 'Matt has always loved me and said I looked beautiful but when I think back I must have looked huge to everyone, I was massively overweight.' Chelsea enjoyed home-cooked meals when she lived with her parents but said when she lost her routine as a student and moved in with railway worker husband Matt, 40, she piled on the pounds. Chelsea joined Slimming World in July 2014 and by December that same year she had slimmed down to a size 12 in time for her wedding Soon her weight rose to 14st 7lbs and she wore a size 20 to 22 but was heartbroken at how big she looked in photos from her holiday to Poland in May 2014. Chelsea, who has polycystic ovary syndrome, a symptom of which is weight gain, joined Slimming World in July the same year and began losing weight at the rate of about a stone a month. In September that same year Matt popped the question and just three months later she married her partner of five years in a size 12 corset top wedding dress she never thought she would fit into. By November 2015 svelte Chelsea had reached her lowest weight of 8st 8lbs and now wears size eight to 10 clothes Chelsea was so successful in her weight loss that she won greatest loser at her local Slimming World club By November 2015 svelte Chelsea had reached her lowest weight of 8st 8lbs and now wears size eight to 10 clothes. She enjoyed a family holiday to Majorca in April last year where she wore shorts and a bikini for the first time ever after covering up in leggings on previous beach breaks. Chelsea, who now works out three times a week and enjoys cooking healthy Slimming World curries, casseroles and stews, said: 'During the holiday to Poland I tried to avoid as many photos as I could. 'The pictures I was in, I looked absolutely huge. That was when I knew I needed to do something - I knew if I didn't I was just going to get bigger and bigger - so I joined Slimming World. Chelsea says that she still cooks big portions but makes sure to use healthy ingredients 'After Matt proposed I was determined to slim down for my wedding day and I was really motivated because I had started seeing results. 'If I hadn't lost the weight I would have had to wear a different wedding dress without a corset top because I hated my arms. 'I can't even imagine being as excited to walk down the aisle as I was if I'd still been that size, I wouldn't have wanted to be in any of the wedding pictures. 'Last year's holiday was the first time I had ever worn a bikini and shorts, I used to wear leggings on the beach and on a previous holiday had to buy cycling shorts for under my dress because my inner thighs were chafing so badly while I walked. 'Now I look back at pictures of myself and can't believe that was me. Everyone says it's amazing and they can't believe how well I have done but I can't really remember being that big any more - all I have now are photographs to remind me. 'I feel a million times better, I am far healthier and happier, more confident and have more energy - I couldn't imagine being that person now. 'I used to cover up to hide the parts of my body I hated but now as a size eight to 10 I can go into any shop and buy whatever I want so I wear different clothes now. 'I am a big eater and I like to eat big portions which is why Slimming World is perfect because you can fill yourself up.'
