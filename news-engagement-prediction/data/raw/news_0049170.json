The draft law is discouraging these activities. Torturing animals will be considered as an offence,\" Shafiul said. \nHe said the offences, considered under the proposed law, range from causing pain to any animal unnecessarily, behaving cruelly, forcing additional work, beating for no reason or any other form of cruelty towards the animal. \nThe authorities will be able to initiate cases against persons violating the law. \nMobile courts will also be able to try the offenders. \nThe Cabinet secretary said authorised organisations like city corporations would be out of the law's purview in the case of culling or sterilising of animals such as dogs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T05:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T19:07:32.145+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
