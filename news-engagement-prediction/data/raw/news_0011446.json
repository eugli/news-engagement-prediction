Over the course of a 16-song set list, Black Sabbath played pretty much every song a fan would’ve wanted to hear at a final concert, including “War Pigs,” “Iron Man,” “N.I.B.,” and of course “Paranoid,” which the band played as an encore while dumping confetti on the crowd. According to Rolling Stone , Ozzy Osbourne asked the audience at one point if they were having fun and if Sabbath should come back and put another big show at some point, and after waiting a moment, he crushed anyone’s hopes that the band would delay the end another time by simply saying, “we’re not.” Also, despite rumors that original drummer Bill Ward would make an appearance, Rolling Stone says there were no “special guests.” \nRolling Stone has the full set list, and you can see some videos from the concert below. \nSubmit your Newswire tips here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T05:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T00:20:13.255+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
