Are you on your period?\" the man asks the insulted woman before going on to ask her out for a drink. \nAs the van speeds off, the woman furiously pedals behind the van, and the motorcyclist filming follows suit. \nWhen the van pulls over, the cyclist stops alongside the van's driver side door and wrenches the side mirror off, dropping it onto the ground before pedalling away. \nThe motorcyclist gasps before pulling alongside the van and letting its driver and passenger know what he thinks. \n\"That's exactly what you deserve, you scum!\" he spits out. \nA 2016 survey found that 85 per cent of women in the UK have been sexually harassed in public. \nIn Malta, a 2014 study conducted by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights found that one in every five women had experienced some form of sexual harassment during the previous 12 months.
