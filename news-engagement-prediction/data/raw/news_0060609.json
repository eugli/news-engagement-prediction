But later, when the auction got over, we came to know it was Harmeet and not Harpreet,” said a franchise official. \nOn the day of the auction, a reputed news agency tweeted, \"Under 19 cricketer Harpreet Singh detained for driving a car straight into Andheri railway station platform last night.” It was however subsequently corrected. Incident of driving car into Andheri Railwy Stn platform involved U19 cricketer Harmeet Singh,not Harpreet Singh as reported earlier #Mumbai pic.twitter.com/CjeI1rxubT \n— ANI (@ANI_news) February 22, 2017 \nAnother agency also wrongly named Harpreet in its initial report, but later corrected the mistake. \n“I’m mentally disturbed… Mera naam toh kharab ho gaya na (I have got a bad name). How can one clear that? I am getting calls from everyone asking what have you done. I was hoping to be picked up at the IPL auction… When my name came, the franchises must have felt why take a player who is in police custody. I am not bothered about IPL now, it’s gone. But even if you run a search on my name on Google, the first thing that comes up is that I was arrested,” Harpreet told The Indian Express.
