But it would seem even luckier he doesn’t have Allan Border as captain. \nThe Australian opener was involved in one of the most bizarre moments in Test history as his classy debut innings on Indian soil was suddenly put on hold for a mad, desperate dash to the toilet, as illness struck him like a bolt of lightning. \nAustralia’s dream start on the first morning in Pune was thrown into chaos in a drama that could only happen in incredible India. \nAs Dean Jones would well know, Border has little sympathy for teammates who are violently ill, and not even Renshaw’s Queensland heritage could save him from a withering spray from Australia’s toughest ever skipper. \n“I hope he’s lying on the table in there half dead,” said Border on Fox Sports. “Otherwise, as captain, I would not be happy.” \nAmid all the chaos, Renshaw’s unprecedented exit might have been hard to fathom, but when he didn’t return after Shaun Marsh’s wicket fell post lunch, it became evident that this was no mere stomach rumbling.

He got forward, he got back and showed bravado when necessary – justifying selectors’ faith in him over Usman Khawaja. \nSkipper Steve Smith, who had just walked out to the middle following David Warner’s dismissal at 1-82, appeared perplexed as an agitated Rensahw met him halfway to the fence. \nThere was a remonstration with the umpires as it was explained that Renshaw was in strife, and then he was gone like Usain Bolt down the straight.

Source: AFP \nFormer captain Michael Clarke was left completely stunned in commentary as he struggled to fathom what he was watching as Shaun Marsh hurriedly joined Smith at the crease as the second new batsmen – all this just 15 minutes before lunch. \nBut their reactions were nothing compared to Border’s brutal assessment. \nWhen you gotta go you gotta go – but not in the middle of a Test match. \nBorder claimed that had Warner not been dismissed, Renshaw wouldn’t have left the field. \n“I don’t think I’ve ever seen that before. He’s obviously just got an upset stomach to some degree and he was probably trying to use the situation where David Warner had just been dismissed to race off the ground and go to the toilet,” said Border on Fox. \n“What happened in the ensuring time there, I can’t ever think of a situation like that that’s happened before where someone’s gone off because they’re a bit ill. \n“If David Warner hadn’t got out then he wouldn’t have even thought about it. It’s a bit of an odd situation. He probably thought he had time to race off the ground and get back on while the new batsman was coming out to the crease. \n“I can tell you what, if Shaun Marsh was dismissed in those last 15 minutes I would’ve been ropeable as captain.” \nAdam Gilchrist once dropped his keeping gloves on the ground and bolted from the field without explanation in Guyana to visit the bathroom back in 2003, much to the shock of captain Steve Waugh.
