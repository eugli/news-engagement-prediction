Selwyn Mayor Sam Broughton said changing winds made the fires unpredictable. \nHe said the region had been unusually dry for the past three years and the grass in the hills had turned brown over the summer. \nSmoke and ash from the fire has been blown across Christchurch, New Zealand's second-largest city. \nMr Broughton said displaced residents were staying at evacuation centres or with relatives. \n\"They need to look after one another, and make sure they have a place to go to tonight,\" he said. \nPhil Claude told Radio New Zealand he and his family ran down a grass track to escape the fire, which destroyed their home. \n\"I could see that the smoke and the flames were being blown right up toward our house and I just yelled 'get out, get out!',\" he said. \nHe said he had been told his house \"was apparently singed\" but found it burned to the ground when he returned. \n\"We didn't have time to get anything [out],\" Mr Claude said. \nNew Zealand's military has been deployed to provide water tankers and engineering equipment as well as firefighters and other personnel. \nA helicopter pilot died in a crash on Tuesday while fighting the blaze.
