They will last up to four hours from the power going off,\" Ms Buchtman said. \nThe best thing to do in with perishable food — meat, fish, cooked leftovers — is to put them straight in the freezer. \n\"Your freezer will last a lot longer because it has been much colder than your fridge,\" she said. \n\"If it's completely full it will actually last for 48 hours before it starts to defrost so that's great. \n\"If the freezer is half full it will warm up a lot quicker, probably 24 hours.\" \nIf the power outage looks like being long, Ms Buchtman advises taking food to a friend's house to store in their fridge. When the power comes back on \n\"Perishable things like meat and fish are the obvious ones that are risky to leave too long above 5 degrees Celsius,\" she said. \n\"Four hours or longer you need to throw out those perishables like meat, eggs, sliced meats and even salads, especially a rice or pasta salad. \n\"But hard cheese, sauces, jars of olives will last and be OK.\" \nIf the power comes back on within four hours, cooked leftovers should probably be eaten the same day. \n\"Normally they only last two to three days in the fridge under 5C anyway,\" she said. Refreeze myth busted \nYou may not need to throw everything out in the freezer, even if the food has begun to thaw. \n\"If your freezer has defrosted a bit, that's OK,\" she said. \n\"When then power comes back on you can actually refreeze everything in there with really no problems. \n\"It might have lost a little bit of quality, but it is a myth that you can't refreeze food which has been defrosted, as long as you have cooked it properly in the first place.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T20:19:51.723+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
