Referencing Thumper, “the super-cool ski instructor” from South Park , he captioned the video: “If you french fry when you’re supposed to pizza, you’re gonna have a bad time! Trust me!!!” \nWhether or not the featured skier is actually the Patriots quarterback is up for debate, but Brady is no stranger to giving the New England fan base off-season scares. After the team’s Super Bowl XLIX victory in 2015, he posted a video on Facebook documenting an impressive (and slightly dangerous) cliff jump in Costa Rica.
