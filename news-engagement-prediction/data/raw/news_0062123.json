John Legend look like Arthur lowkey pic.twitter.com/bfeG3cYo4M \n— Emily Sowah (@sowahblanket) February 20, 2017 \nNormally, I’d say being compared to this creature is super offensive. Giphy \nBut Arthur looks nothing like an actual aarvark, so I think the resemblance is not that unflattering. At least you don’t have demonic red eyes, John! \nWell, naturally, Chrissy Teigen had the most spot-on response to this comparison considering the fact she runs the best Twitter account of all time. Period. John when you tell him he looks like Arthur pic.twitter.com/0NW3NDtAb1 \n— christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) February 21, 2017 \nThere are so many comedic layers to this tweet, it’s insane. I’m like Salieri listening to Mozart for the first time when I read this tweet. \nChrissy responded to someone’s comparison of her husband to Arthur with an Arthur meme that also implies he really does look like Arthur. \nI’m sorry, but just shut Twitter down. It doesn’t get any better than this. \nChrissy has continued her Twitter winning streak with some savage take-downs of Trump , an art form she has been perfecting since 201 1 . \nAside from sending out masterful tweets, she posed for the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue and pretty much got completely naked for it. She's back! Sexy Chrissy Teigen returns to Sports Illustrated To view this video please enable JavaScript, and considerupgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nBasically, Chrissy is a flawless person and despite the fact she does not agree with the notion her marriage with John Legend is “ relationship goals ,” it is. \nI would even go further to say Chrissy “Best Twitterer Ever” Teigen is “everything goals.” \nNeedless to say, I think we can all agree this latest tweet definitely proves that. \nNow, excuse me while I ponder which cartoon character Chrissy Teigen looks like for the next 24 hours straight. \n  CITATIONS Uproxx Uproxx", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:29:35.782+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
