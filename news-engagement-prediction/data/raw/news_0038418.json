The film is based on Rebecca Skloot's bestselling nonfiction book about Henrietta Lacks, the black woman whose cells—unbeknownst to her, and certainly unauthorized by her—were reproduced and used by scientists to develop countless medical vaccines, gene mapping, in vitro fertilization, and more. Oprah Winfrey and Rose Byrne star in the adaptation: Winfrey as Deborah Lacks, Henrietta's daughter, who barely knew her mother; and Byrne as Rebecca Skloot. Winfrey was also an executive producer on the film.   The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks will debut on HBO on April 22 at 8 P.M.
