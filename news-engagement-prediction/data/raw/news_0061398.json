CNN was not allowed to attend, while other networks were permitted. CNN Former Top U.S. Border Patrol Officials Question DHS Plan According to former U.S. border patrol officials, a plan from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to add over 5,000 agents might be unnecessary and could present many logistical challenges. In comments to Reuters, three former top officials at U.S. Customs and Border Patrol say that ramping up hiring would be expensive, while rapid expansion also poses the risk of corruption. W. Ralph Basham who led U.S. Customs and Border Protection during George W. Bush's administration, says, \"Congress is going to be looking at this very carefully and looking for justification for this kind of money to make sure they don't write a check that is not necessary. The question will be do we need more agents or do we need money for technology and infrastructure.\" Wochit News SETTINGS OFF HD HQ SD LO Woman becomes the first person with Down syndrome to finish Austin Half Marathon TODAY See more videos SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL What to watch next Rare look at U.S. forces assisting in fight against ISIS CBS News 1:59 CNN blocked from White House press briefing CNN 3:00 Former Top U.S. Border Patrol Officials Question DHS Plan Wochit News 0:54 US Flexes Its Military Muscle Off China NBC News 0:36 Trump criticizes 'fake, phony' media at CPAC The Washington Post 1:47 Priebus Call To FBI Violated Norms And Rules Wochit News 0:39 Mysterious 'women appreciate' billboard stokes outrage FOX News 0:16 Bees learn 'soccer' in new study CNN 0:49 Guatemalan navy blocks Dutch 'abortion ship' Reuters 1:18 Anti-immigrant violence flares in South Africa Reuters 1:21 Permit no longer needed to carry concealed gun WMUR Manchester 1:55 Key moments from Trump's speech at CPAC The Washington Post 4:49 Refugees crossing Canadian border for asylum CBS News 2:54 Angry bees attack people, dog in Southern California CBS News 0:55 Kansas man charged with fatal shooting in possible hate crime Reuters 2:14 Hundreds Wait to See Barack Obama in New York City Veuer 0:40 UP NEXT\nAs Kayleigh Williamson ran the course of the Austin Half Marathon, the humidity, hills and an injured ankle slowed her down. Sometimes she walked. Sometimes she ran.\nSoon, it became clear to her mom, Sandy Williamson, that the pain was hobbling 26-year-old Kayleigh.\n\"If you want to stop, this is your race, you can stop,\" Williamson said, hoping to spare Kayleigh, who has Down syndrome, more agony.\nBut Kayleigh had been dreaming of finishing a half marathon; she couldn't give up now.\n\"No, I am not quitting,\" she told Williamson. \"I can do this and I am going to do this and no one is going to stop me.\"\nRELATED: Woman with Down syndrome living her dream as Zumba instructor\nThis determination helped Kayleigh become the first person with Down syndrome to finish the Austin Half Marathon; she completed the 13.1 miles in six hours, 22 minutes, and 57 seconds.\n\"I wanted to get to the finish line,\" Kayleigh told TODAY. \"I was proud of myself.\"\nHer mom wasn't surprised. Her daughter's always been determined. She took Krav Maga for three years, swims and plays basketball with the Special Olympics.\n\"She doesn't seem to have it in her to say 'OK, I quit,'\" said Williamson.\nWhile Kayleigh's attitude helped her achieve her dream, she also had a little help from some friends. About two dozen people and a goldendoodle named Chuck ran and walked with her.\n\"I saw them taking turns building her up,\" Williamson said. \"It was very emotional.\"\n© Kim Davis/RunLab Austin RELATED: First runner with Down syndrome finishes NYC marathon\nKim Davis, owner of RunLab Austin , has been helping Kayleigh with her ankle injury, ran with Kayleigh throughout the entire race (though she thinks her dog Chuck truly motivated Kayleigh). When the crowds died down because the marathon finished, Davis called friends to come cheer for Kayleigh.\n\"By the end of the race she had about 15 or 20 people there,\" Davis said. \"It was really cool.\"\nBecause Kayleigh was the last runner they also needed police officers to close the intersections. This disruption annoyed some drivers, but soon they, too, became cheerleaders.\n\"They would stop and start yelling and encouraging her. The whole city was watching her,\" said Williamson.\n© Kim Davis/RunLab Austin Kayleigh's performance wowed Davis.\n\"She is a super inspirational human,\" said Davis. \"Anyone that spends six-and-a-half hours on a hilly humid course like that even though they can't run the whole thing, it was touching.\"\nRELATED: Man with Down syndrome excitedly cheers reading college acceptance letter\nThe marathon organizers put the finish line back up so that Kayleigh could cross it and get her medal. When she spotted the finish line, she stopped, took down her hair, put her arms in the air and ran across it.\n\"It was a day us that made us feel good about humanity,\" said Davis.\n© Kim Davis/RunLab Austin RELATED: Woman with Down syndrome defies odds to celebrate her 75th birthday\nWatching Kayleigh taught Williamson more about her daughter.\n\"I spent so much time trying to protect her,\" she said. \"The race changed my perspective; I didn't need to protect her from the world. She could take on the world.\"\n© Sandy Williamson RELATED: Family stands up for brother with Down syndrome working at restaurant\nAnd, Williamson hopes Kayleigh inspires others.\n\"Don't let others' concept of what you can and cannot do define you,\" Williamson said.\n© Kim Davis/RunLab Austin Kayleigh approaching the finish line of her first half marathon race.
