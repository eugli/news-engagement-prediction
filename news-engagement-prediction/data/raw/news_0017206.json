We need alcohol.' He found some tissues and got to work,\" Locke wrote. \nOther passengers quickly joined in, with tissues and hand sanitizer of their own. According to Locke, within two minutes all of the graffiti had been cleaned away. \n\"'I guess this is Trump's America,' said one passenger,\" Locke wrote. \"No sir, it's not. Not tonight and not ever. Not as long as stubborn New Yorkers have anything to say about it.\" \nOther Twitter users appear to have confirmed the incident. — R. Kyle Alagood (@rkylealagood) February 5, 2017 \nLocke's Facebook post quickly went viral, racking up more than 300,000 likes by Sunday morning. The story spread to Facebook, where a screenshot of the Facebook post by a Huffington Post editor was favorited 124,000 times, and retweeted by 87,000 users. \nMeanwhile, in New York City. pic.twitter.com/2OiArRm1HU — Philip Lewis (@Phil_Lewis_) February 5, 2017 \nHundreds of people have commented on Locke's post and posted about the incident on Twitter, including former first daughter Chelsea Clinton. \nThis is how you make America great again.

Solidarity people!\" \nOthers, however, dismissed the photos as \"propaganda\" and took issue with Locke connecting the incident to Trump's election.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T23:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T18:25:02.338+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
