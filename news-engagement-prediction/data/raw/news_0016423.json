Stepping off the team plane at the airport, New England defensive coordinator Matt Patricia took a clear shot at NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell by wearing a t-shirt that featured Goodell wearing a bright red clown nose. \nGoodell, perhaps the most hated man in New England as a result of Deflategate, suffered through several awkward encounters with different members of the Patriots after the Super Bowl ended. The crowd booed him mercilessly in Houston as he tried to congratulate New England, and then Robert Kraft took a clear shot at him with his post-game celebration speech. \nStepping off the aeroplane, Patricia got in on the fun. \nNot shockingly, the specific t-shirt that Patricia wore is the product of Barstool Sports . \nPatricia was also seen partying with Barstool founder and New England superfan David Portnoy after the Super Bowl. \n(Note some foul language below): \nAfter the Cavaliers won the NBA Finals, LeBron James stepped off his team plane in Cleveland wearing an Ultimate Warrior t-shirt — a not very subtle shot at the Golden State Warriors. \nIt seems that Patricia liked LeBron’s idea. \nLooks like Matt Patricia is wearing a Goodell clown shirt as the team arrives back in Boston pic.twitter.com/YK8OPZ4Hoh — Nick Emmons TV (@nicknbcboston) February 6, 2017 Matt Patricia rocking our Goodell clown shirt like an absolute legend pic.twitter.com/xQRgLgUb6C", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T05:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:08:15.073+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
