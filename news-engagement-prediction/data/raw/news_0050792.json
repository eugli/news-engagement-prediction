The SBI's findings were turned over to the North Carolina Attorney General's Office in December, but no charges have been filed in the case so far. \nDebra Halbrook, who tipped the SBI off to the alleged scheme, said Bradsher fired her last month when he surmised she was assisting in the investigation. She filed suit seeking damages for her lost back pay, lost future earnings, lost health and retirement benefits, as well as punitive damages and triple damages allowed under the state Whistleblower Act. \nBradsher, Blitzer, their wives, District Judge John Hoyte Stultz III, who previously worked as an assistant district attorney in Bradsher's office, and two other staffers in Bradsher's office were named as defendants in the lawsuit.
