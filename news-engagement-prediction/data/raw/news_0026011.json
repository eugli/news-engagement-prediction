I don't have to put on a front to impress anyone,\" Bregoli is recorded saying in footage of her time at the ranch. \nHowever, footage from an interview with producers preparing her for this episode shows Bregoli insisting her change was another facade. \n\"That was just a show, damn, I just want to get out of there,\" she said to producers, insisting that if they kept her at the ranch for six years she'd still come out the same person. \nMcGraw also took issue with Bregoli's mother Barbara Ann, saying that she didn't commit to her promise to follow the ranch's efforts to turn her life around, and was setting a bad example for her daughter. The host also took issue with what the producers perceived to be a list of \"demands\" from Barbara Ann, saying that her requests made her appear ungrateful. \nFrom the list, Barbara Ann asked that the show not contact Bregoli's father. However, nearly 12 hours before the show aired, PalmBeachPost.com published an exclusive interview with the father, Ira Peskowitz. \nThe article also revealed court documents showing that Peskowitz still financially supports his daughter, and that Barbara Ann has made it difficult for him to see Bregoli. This contradicts Barbara Ann and Bregoli's story from their first appearance on the show that her father was out of the picture . \n\"Danielle feels rejected by me. That poor girl. I did not abandon her. I left her mother, but I did not abandon her,\" Peskowitz told PalmBeachPost.com. \"I know there is a little girl in there and I hope one day she can hug me and say, 'I love you, daddy.'\" \nBoth Barbara Ann and Bregoli declined to discuss Bregoli's agent and lawyer while being recorded. And though McGraw said that Bregoli's capitalization of her viral fame isn't an issue, he insisted issues would arise if the money got in the way of her recovery. \nWhile Bregoli maintained her \"street\" personality, even telling McGraw, \"You were nothing before I came on the show,\" she appeared softer, at least grateful that McGraw put her through the ranch's program. But this more contained personality contradicts reports of Bregoli hitting another passenger on a Spirit Airlines plane , and the aggressive responses to haters through her Instagram and Snapchat stories. \nAnd when the Daily Dot asked Bregoli via email in January if The Dr. Phil Show convinced her to change, she replied simply, \"hell fuck no.\" \nThat's not to say that duality doesn't exist—Bregoli very well could have walked away from her time at the treatment facility with lessons learned, and is now taking the time to earn figures that many internet sensations don't get the chance to see themselves.
