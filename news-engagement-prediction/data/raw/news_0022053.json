CASA Hogan Trump Protest \nDemonstrators unhappy with Governor Hogan's silence on recent Trump Administration actions took to Lawyer's Mall on Saturday afternoon to voice their opinions. \nDemonstrators unhappy with Governor Hogan's silence on recent Trump Administration actions took to Lawyer's Mall on Saturday afternoon to voice their opinions. More than 800 Marylanders ask: Will Hogan answer our questions about Trump? \nGov. Larry Hogan 's recent State of the State speech was remarkable for its failure to explain his position on a number of vital issues for Maryland voters, despite thousands of calls, Facebook posts, letters and emails from his constituents ( \"Hogan's alternate reality,\" Feb. 1). In response, over 700 Maryland residents signed this letter in a period of less than 12 hours, asking him to hold an open town hall meeting to hear our concerns and provide us with concrete policy statements and proposals. \nWe are Maryland voters who care deeply about the present and future of our state. We hail from all over Maryland, and we have made thousands of phone calls to Governor Hogan's office in the last several weeks seeking his views on a wide range of issues. We are still waiting for his answers. \nHundreds of thousands of Marylanders may lose their health care and many more risk the loss of important benefits, such as the elimination of lifetime maximums, as a result of the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. We are unable to support refugees fleeing death and destruction as a result of the president's action, and the federal government is threatening to deputize our local law enforcement for the purposes of enforcing immigration law rather than our own criminal laws and to take away funding from sanctuary cities. Our Jewish Community Centers, mosques, churches and public schools have become targets of hateful speech and acts. Also, recent news reports suggest that the new administration may reduce funds for women's health care and domestic violence shelters, which provide care and refuge to the most vulnerable among us. \nMr. Hogan is our governor. We voted him into office, yet we feel our concerns are being ignored. We deserve to know how he proposes to address these issues. What is he going to do about the impending health care crisis in Maryland? What is he doing to help ensure that Maryland continues to be a welcoming place for immigrants and people fleeing from violence and persecution? What does he propose to keep our houses of worship and our schools safe from hate? What does he propose to ensure access to basic women's health care services and to minimize the harm to victims of domestic violence in the wake of reduced federal funding to shelters? \nBecause our phone calls have gone unheeded and many of our Facebook posts have been deleted and blocked, we request that Governor Hogan announce and hold an open town hall meeting to share with us his concrete policy proposals on health care coverage, his views on immigration, and how he will show leadership in response to the uptick in hateful acts in our state and the potential defunding of domestic violence shelters and resources. Protesters urge Gov. Hogan to speak out against Trump Hundreds of protesters have gathered outside Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan 's residence, urging the Republican to speak out against President Donald Trump 's policies and cabinet nominees. Local media report the crowds gathered Saturday in Annapolis. Some held signs that said, \"Your silence is deafening.\"... Hundreds of protesters have gathered outside Maryland Gov.
