TMZ has learned. \nLaw enforcement sources tell us the woman claims she met up with Comrie at a bar Saturday night and went back to his West L.A. condo. She claims he raped her multiple times. \nThe woman says she almost immediately went to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center nearby, and a rape kit was administered. \nSources connected with Comrie say he's known the woman for a long time and acknowledges he had sex with her, but insists she gave full consent. The sources also say the encounter was a 3-way and the other woman has not filed any complaint. \nWe're told so far Comrie has not spoken to cops.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T12:12:01.649+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
