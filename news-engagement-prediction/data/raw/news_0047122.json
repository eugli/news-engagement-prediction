Mother-of-one Lauren Walker was buying her food at the M&S food hall in Uddingston, Glasgow, when her son, Alistair Findlay, began crying his eyes out. Ms Walker struggled to calm the youngster and was on the verge of leaving the store, until a worker named Mubarak Ahmad came to her rescue. Having helped her with her shopping earlier in her visit, Mr Ahmad had now taken up position on the tills and was waiting to provide further assistance.

Mr Ahmad added: 'Chatting to customers and helping make a difference where I can is the bit of my job I enjoy the most.'
