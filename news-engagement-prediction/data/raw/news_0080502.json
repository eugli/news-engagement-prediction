The doctors have said that they have put him in an induced coma ... he has got a fractured skull and bleeding on the brain and, yeah, he looks pretty messed up,” Leon Ball said of his brother’s desperate condition. \nIt was never supposed to be like this. Mr Ball took all the right steps before the party at his home in the suburb of Padbury. \nHe told police what was happening and sent a polite note to the neighbours, and even included his number on it for them to call if they had any issues. \n“This is a courtesy letter to inform you that we are having a party tonight,” the note said. \n“We apologise for the noise and hope you enjoy your night.” \nAbout 100 guests were expected and their names were at the door. \nIt was supposed to be a night of fun for teenagers to party safely following a school ball. It was for a friend’s teenage daughter; he was simply providing the venue. \nLeon Ball told Perth Now they believe he was trying to protect the young people at his home from gatecrashers when things got out of control. \nWitnesses said up to 15 young men swarmed around the property about midnight and tried to get in by clambering over fences. Ryan Ball was attacked by gatecrashers. Picture: Facebook Source: Facebook Ryan Ball has serious injuries, including bleeding on the brain. Picture: Channel 9 Source: Channel 9 \nParty guests told of chaos where the intruders began “jumping the fences from all four sides”. \nTo calm the situation, Mr Ball shut the party down. But the gatecrashers who were hellbent on causing mayhem weren’t finished. \nPolice have been told the intruders began picking fights with the young guests as they were leaving. It was during these confusing moments that Leon Ball believes his brother was critically injured. \n“That is what is most traumatic about it ... knowing that he was probably trying to stop someone else from being hurt,” he said. \nOfficers have been at the property and along the street gathering evidence and witnesses but no arrests have been made — there isn’t even a clear description of the attackers that has been released. \nDiscarded boxes of beer and bourbon could be seen littering the ground near the party. \nA golf club is one item that has been recovered, but what role, if any, it played in the attack is unclear. One line of inquiry is the attackers could have been involved in other incidents that occurred in the Padbury area on Saturday night. Ryan Ball was rushed to hospital in a critical condition. Picture: Channel 7 Source: Channel 7 Leon Ball has vowed to track down whoever attacked his brother. Picture: Channel 9 Source: Channel 9 \nThat including the bashing and robbery of up to 20 young people, including two females. \nPolice have urged teenagers who were at the party to come forward if they have footage of the violence on their phones. \nThe brutal assault came as the Ball family were on the brink of some happy times. Both brothers had been planning to take their mother on a cruise to celebrate her 70th birthday. \nNow nothing is certain and the family are getting through minute by minute hoping Ryan recovers. \nDoctors tried to wake him on Monday but he didn’t react well. The bleeding on the brain he is suffering from is where the motor skills and other vital functions are located, reported The West Australian. \n“He is a gentle giant ... he is one you want in your corner, but he is never one to pick a fight,” he said. Ryan Ball is suffering from serious head wounds. Picture: Facebook Source: Facebook Police look for evidence on the street Ryan Ball was seriously assaulted. Picture: Channel 7 Source: Channel 9 \n“I just do not get it. We are seeing it [violence] more and more and people just really need to keep their hands to themselves. It’s horrendous.” \nLeon Ball told Perth radio station 6PR on Monday the swelling in his brother’s brain was \n“quite horrific.” \n“To be incapacitated in that sense is terrible to watch ... it’s something that just shouldn’t happen.” \nDespite the when doctors tried to wake him, there was some good news yesterday. A CAT scan revealed there was an 85 per cent chance of him not being paralysed. If he wakes up. \nMr Ball told reporters he vowed to find whoever hurt his brother. \n“I’m out to find these people. And I will find them.” \nThe vicious attack has angered many Perth residents who showed their horror — and their anger — about youth violence in posts on Facebook. \n“This is horrific. I feel for the family. Those responsible have blood on their hands regardless of what the outcome is for Ryan. What a tragic turn of events in his own home during a time of celebration,” Kelly Brady wrote. \nJudith Molyneux wrote: Do we now have to employ security guards for kids partie? Penalties need to be harsh for these little s***s,” while another summed up the mood of many when he commented: “The lucky country!? All the money and food, but why so angry? Don’t get it! Hope you recover mate. Again and again, over and over this happens.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T08:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T05:58:01.763+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
