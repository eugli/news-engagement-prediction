(Photo: AFP/Ludovic Marin) A \nPARIS: A French soldier on Friday (Feb 3) opened fire on and wounded a man armed with a knife after he tried to enter the Louvre musuem in central Paris carrying a suitcase, police sources said. \nOne source said the man had been trying to get into the museum's underground shop and had attacked another soldier before being shot and seriously wounded. \nPolice said the area had been evacuated. \n\"Serious public security incident under way in Paris in the Louvre area,\" the interior ministry tweeted as streets in the area were cordoned off to traffic and pedestrians. \nThe ministry urged people not to spread false information and to follow government accounts for updates. \nA spokewoman for Louvre said the museum was \"closed for the moment\" but would not confirm reports it had been evacuated. \nA Reuters witness at the scene said police had cordoned off access to the museum. \nFrance has been hit by a series of militant attacks over the past two years that have killed more than 230 people and which have been claimed by the militant group Islamic State. \nThe most recent deadly attack took place in the southern city of Nice when a man drove a truck into a crowd on the seafront killing 86. \nTwo potential attacks were thwarted in September including one by a group of women who parked a car containing gas canisters near Paris's Notre Dame Cathedral. \nThe country is less than three months away from a presidential election in which security and fears of terrorism are among the key issues. - Agencies/nc", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T16:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T12:09:34.784+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
