Pic/Karolina's Instagram account \nDoha: Czech tennis stars Karolina and Kristyna Pliskova are identical twins, and people are generally confused when it comes to identifying them. Karolina is currently World No. 3, while Kristyna, who is two minutes older to Karolina, is ranked No. 55. Worse still, when both sisters are participating in the same event, the mix-up between the twins becomes even more complicated. While this mix-up can seem funny to outsiders, Karolina says she's fed up of people mistaking her for Kristyna.\nKristyna Pliskova posted this picture on Instagram  \n\"It's happening almost every day, like a hundred times. I almost got used to this thing. But still it surprises me... Yeah, I think we have different first names, so maybe the people could see the draw and just don't make sure they're still confusing us,\" Karolina was quoted as saying by tennis.com.\n\"Sometimes it's not really nice, especially for her. But, yeah, we are identical twins,\" added the 24-year-old, who crashed out of the Dubai Tennis Championships on Tuesday in the second round, losing in straight sets to France's Kristina Mladenovic.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:17:07.885+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
