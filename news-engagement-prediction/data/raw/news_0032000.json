The survey is open until Feb, 28. \n\"We're hoping to have a bill drafted by mid-March,\" Dang said. \nThe survey gives the times of sunrises and sunsets in six different Alberta cities, including Lethbridge and Fort McMurray in June and December under Mountain Standard Time and Daylight Mountain Time.\nPeople are asked to indicate whether they want more morning light or evening light in the winter and summer, and whether they want to avoid changing their clocks twice a year.\nThe legislative assembly has tabled two petitions in support of ending daylight saving time in the past two years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T20:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:09:09.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
