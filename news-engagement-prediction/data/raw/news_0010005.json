Benyam Kidane \nPublished on Jan. 30, 2017 \nJan. 30, 2017 \nMilwaukee Bucks rookie Thon Maker is now free to travel in and out of the United States after fears emerged the Sudanese-born Australian would be affected by Donald Trump's Executive Order on immigration. \nMORE: Trading Carmelo Anthony to a contender not so simple \nMaker was born in Sudan, which is one of the seven listed Muslim majority countries including Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen whose citizens are banned from entering the United States. Confusion arose due to Maker technically being from what is now South Sudan, which gained independance from Sudan in 2011. \nAlthough the NBA has not received offical clarification from the State Department after reaching out earlier this week , the Australian Government has confirmed Maker will not be affected. \nPrime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull announced today that Australians holding dual citizenships can still move freely between the USA and Australia. \n\"We have received confirmation from the White House this morning that Australian passport holders will be able to travel to and from the United States in the normal way,\" he said. \n\"They won't be affected by the recent executive order regardless of whether they are dual citizens of another country or where they were born.\" \nLos Angeles Lakers forward Luol Deng, who is also from South Sudan but holds a British passport will also be unaffected by the ban following Britain arranging a similar exemption for dual citizens earlier in the week. \nDeng has been vocal in his support for refugees, declaring that he 'stands by refugees and migrants of all religions.'
