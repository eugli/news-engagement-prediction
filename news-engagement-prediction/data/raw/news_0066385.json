He's even spoken with general manager Joe Sakic about the situation, since the Avs are well out of the playoff picture.\nIginla has only seven goals in the final season of his three-year deal. He's uncertain how much longer he will play.\n\"Iggy wants one last shot at the playoffs. Everybody in this dressing room, around the league, feels the same way,\" captain Gabriel Landeskog said. \"We'd love to see somebody like that win.\"\nGranted, Iginla's probably not the first player teams inquire about when they place a call to the last-place Avalanche. That would be Landeskog or Matt Duchene.\n'Amazing amount of experience' But the Avalanche have a recent history of moving players to help them out — like when the team dealt Cody McLeod to Nashville last month.\n\"If he's traded and has a chance to make a Cup run, he's going to bring an amazing amount of experience to whatever team he's traded to,\" Duchene said. \"I'm hoping he can win a Stanley Cup this year. It would be pretty amazing to see that.\"\nColorado Avalanche right wing Jarome Iginla, top, has always played with a physical edge. (David Zalubowski/The Associated Press)\nThis has been a trying season for an Avalanche team expecting big things even with the sudden departure of coach Patrick Roy in August. Their longest win streak is two games and they're a league-worst 7-20-2 at home.\nGrumbling, though, is far from Iginla's style.\n\"Even when things are not going his way, he's trying new things to find something that works,\" Landeskog said. \"That goes to show what kind of determination he has.\"\nIginla hasn't given trade possibilities all that much thought. It's wasted energy for something out of his control. He's only been traded once near the deadline — when he went from Calgary to Pittsburgh on March 28, 2013.\n\"From my point of view, it's nice to just focus on games, enjoy that part, enjoy competing,\" said Iginla, a first-round pick by Dallas in 1995 before being shipped to Calgary that December. \"I might not be moving at the deadline. I don't know.\n\"I've enjoyed it here and enjoyed the different relationships and getting to know the guys. It's a great city. Lots of positives. We'll see what happens.\"\n'Like that at his age' Iginla is currently 14th in league history for most games played (1,532), 16th in goals scored (618), 34th in points (1,289) and eighth in game-winners (97).\nWhat's more, he's had 17 seasons with 20 or more goals, played in numerous All-Star Games and won two Olympic gold medals for Team Canada.\nThe only thing missing from his resume is a Stanley Cup title. He got close with the Flames in 2003-04, when they lost to Tampa Bay in Game 7.\n\"It would be awesome to have that final feather in his cap,\" said Duchene, who lockers right next to Iginla at the practice facility. \"It's cool to see the thirst and hunger he has for the game and for scoring goals. He's like a little kid like that. I love to see it. I'm like that. I hope I'm still like that at his age.\"\nTo think, Iginla wanted to follow in the footsteps of his childhood idol, Grant Fuhr, and become a goaltender. As a youngster, Iginla even got goalie pads one year for Christmas.\n\"I thought I really loved it,\" Iginla said. \"Then, we're crushing teams and you're stopping only six shots. I was like, 'No.' That was the end of that dream. I wanted to be in the action.\"\nHe always has been, too. For how much longer, that's difficult to say.\n\"Whether it's this year, next year, I don't know,\" Iginla said. \"But we all want to be part of the playoffs.\"\n© The Associated Press, 2017", "external_links": ["http://www.cp.org/"], "published": "2017-02-23T04:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T08:08:28.677+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
