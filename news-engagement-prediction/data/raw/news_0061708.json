Wow, it’s such a good video. All the beautiful tigers look up at the sky and run around. Eventually they get the drone, and get their heart rates up in the process. Good for them. Good for me.\nAccording to a caption on the BBC website , the tigers are being intentionally lured into exercise by a trainer who is operating the drone. That doesn’t totally explain the content of the video, which is mostly of these tigers beginning to eat the drone, then recoiling from it after it starts smoking. I suppose you’ll have to fill in your own context for those plot points, as the video is not accompanied by a news story of any kind.\nIn the eyes of : A drone is knocked out of the sky after being chased by a group of tigers in China pic.twitter.com/fiEghQKwR4\n— ITV News (@itvnews) February 23, 2017 If you choose to watch this video on the BBC site, you’ll notice some suggestions for further viewing. They’re called “When a bear gets trapped in your car” and “Violent end to goat-tiger friendship.” I watched them both. They’re not good like this video.\nI don’t like watching a bear struggle to get out of a car, nor do I like watching the inherent violence of the natural world take place in front of my eyes. I like watching nature rebel against technologies built by man, as a way of sweetly reminding us that we are not that cool or smart. That’s why my favorite movies are, in order from least to most favorite: Jurassic World , Jurassic Park , The Lost World: Jurassic Park, Jurassic Park III , and Blair Witch (2016).\nEvery time I think I absolutely must learn how to code or build robots in order to survive, I’ll return to this clip and remember that anything I ever program or engineer can be dismantled by a tiger jaw in a matter of seconds, and so can my face.
