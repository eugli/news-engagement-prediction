The Vols had just watched a 19-point lead and their four-game winning streak come crashing down in a disastrous second half on the road. “It’s hard to use it as a positive,” Williams told GoVols247 after the game. “I feel like it did humble us a little bit, that no matter what we can come out and lose. I guess we were used to winning.\" \n(Want the latest scoop on Tennessee football and basketball? Make sure you're in the loop — take five seconds to sign up for our FREE Vols newsletter now!) Tennessee (13-10, 5-5 SEC), having won five of its last six games, led 29-10 with four minutes, 50 seconds left in the first half, after dominating the game's first 15 minutes. Mississippi State outscored the Vols 43-26 in the second half, thwarting a Tennessee team that was the hottest in the SEC and entering NCAA Tournament bubble conversations. “We got comfortable in the first half, saw we were up by a big lead,” Williams said. “We just said to each other that we have to come to play and we didn’t. We allowed the other team to get in it” That’s the lesson moving forward, starting Wednesday (TV: SEC Network, 6:30 p.m.) against Ole Miss (14-9, 5-5). Tennessee can't keep letting other teams back in games. Tennessee freshman forward Grant Williams (Photo: Matt Bush, USA TODAY Sports) When things go wrong, the Vols have to keep playing. They can’t let a stagnant offense remain stagnant. They can’t let rebounding numbers get too one-sided or play too careless with the ball. While giving up four double-digit losses this season — at North Carolina (15), Arkansas (13), at Ole Miss (13), Mississippi State (19) — too many of those things have happened too often. “Just have to play hard and execute,” freshman point guard Jordan Bone said on Saturday. “It’s not really hard, it’s just a matter of doing it. “We weren’t ready in the second half (against Mississippi State). We lost the rebound and turnover battle. We didn’t deserve to win the game, especially on the road.” Tennessee was out-rebounded 55-45 by Mississippi State, something that only happened once during the four-game win streak. Kentucky had 40 rebounds to the Vols’ 39. “I think that they have to understand more than anything, and I think they do, that you just can’t get out-rebounded,” Tennessee coach Rick Barnes said on Monday. “You can’t give up 21 offensive rebounds and turn the ball over more than your opponent and expect to win. You lose the rebounding battle and the turnover numbers don’t work in your favor, you’re not going to win a lot of games.” It was a similar loss at Ole Miss on Jan. 17 that sparked Tennessee’s hot streak. The Vols led 52-39 with 15 minutes left, only to get outscored 41-17 down the stretch as the Rebels rallied to win by 11. Tennessee turned that loss into a positive, ripping off three straight home wins — Mississippi State, Kentucky, Kansas State — and a road win at Auburn. With two home games this week — the Vols host Georgia on Saturday (TV: ESPNU, 4 p.m.) — this young Tennessee basketball team needs to use the loss at Mississippi State the same way. Take care of business on the glass, limit turnovers and win games to stay relevant in the bubble talk. Doing all of the above, though, means finding an answer when the waves of momentum are crashing against you. “A lot of things can flip momentum, a lot of different things,” Barnes said. “Maturity, you get a lead and think the game is over, the other team isn’t going to play. Shot selection. Turnovers. Referees can sometimes be part of the momentum getting turned around. “When that happens, you have to get aggressive, you can’t stay passive and hope that it’s just going to be OK, it’s going to turn back. You have to turn it back.” \n(Buy one month of GoVols247 VIP access and GET TWO MONTHS FREE .)
