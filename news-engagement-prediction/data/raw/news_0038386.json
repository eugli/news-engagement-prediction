The US State Department lists the group as being directed by Nazi Germany.\nRead more Melania Trump 'is miserable in her role as First Lady' ​Horthy, who served as Regent of The Kingdom of Hungary between 1920 and 1944, was a self-declared hater of Jews. In 1940 he wrote: “Concerning the Jewish problem, for all my life I have been an anti-Semite. \n“I have never had contact with Jews. I have considered it intolerable that here in Hungary everything, every factory, bank, large fortune, business, theatre, press, commerce, etc. should be in Jewish hands, and that the Jew should be the image reflected of Hungary, especially abroad. \n“To replace the Jews, who have everything in their hands…requires a generation at least”.\nWhy is Trump Adviser @SebGorka wearing medal of Nazi collaborating group? And why won't he answer ?'s about it? https://t.co/FTbzN0DwHT \n— Eli Clifton (@EliClifton) February 14, 2017 Despite the controversial history of the medal, Mr Gorka said he wore it in memory of his family and the suffering they endured. He said his father has been tortured and imprisoned by Hungarian communists in the late 1940s after he founded “underground organisations of pro-democracy, anti-Communists to work about the Soviet dictatorship”.\nIn a video released by far-right website Breitbart News, he said: “In 1979 my father was awarded a decoration for his resistance to dictatorship and, although he passed away 14 years ago, I wear that medal in remembrance of what my family went through and what it represents today to me as an American.\nThe medal “reminds me of what they suffered under the Nazis and under the communists”, he said.\n“I’m a proud American now and I wear that medal now and again. Why? To remind myself where I came from, what my parents suffered under both the Nazis and communists and to help me in my work today, because as far as I’m concerned groups like the Islamic state, like Al-Qaida, they’re just another kind of totalitarian. \nThe controversial orders Donald Trump has already issued 10 show all The controversial orders Donald Trump has already issued 1/10 Trump and abortion Protesters flood Independence Avenue during the Women's March\nGetty\n2/10 Trump and abortion US President Donald Trump signs an executive order as Chief of Staff Reince Priebus looks on in the Oval Office of the White House\nGetty Images\n3/10 Trump and 'Obamacare' Nancy Pelosi who is the minority leader of the House of Representatives speaks beside House Democrats at an event to protect the Affordable Care Act in Los Angeles, California.
