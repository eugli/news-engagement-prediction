The calls were to a Jeffrey Pike, someone Newell didn’t know. \nWhen enough was enough, Newell called the number, told Cobb’s “representative” that she was not Pike and no longer wished to receive any more robotic solicitations. \nBut the calls from three phone numbers kept coming: at 2:45 p.m. on May 11; at 2:35 p.m. on May 13; at 1:54 p.m. on May 18; at 4:21 p.m. on May 20; at 1:28 p.m. on May 26; at 8:25 p.m. on May 27; at 1:34 p.m. on June 10; at 10:26 a.m. on June 17; at at 4:47 p.m. on June 21; at 10:11 a.m. on June 22; at 12:26 p.m. on June 27 and at 10:11 a.m. on June 29. \nFinally after nearly two months of robot calls, Newell picked up the phone herself and hired New Jersey lawyer David P.
