And getting a manufacturing operation up and running is a long and arduous process, as Apple has learned. \nThere are other potential hurdles to overcome. India's crowded roads and unreliable electricity grid are not well suited to Tesla's sleek battery-driven cars. \n\"If it works there, it will work everywhere,\" was the response of one Twitter user. \nBut Musk has made his ambitions clear, including India in the list of countries where Tesla's new Model 3 is available for pre-order. \nRelated: Tesla reveals what it will charge for a charge \nIn another tweet in March last year, Musk said the eventual rollout would also include an India-wide network of superchargers -- the roadside stations across the U.S. that replenish Tesla batteries in \"minutes instead of hours.\" \nIf Tesla does make it to India, its high-end electric cars could help make a big dent in the country's notorious air pollution .
