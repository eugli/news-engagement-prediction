Whether you're here or Australia, it doesn't matter.\" \nThe Australian coach said he is expecting friendly pitches to be prepared in the four-Test series, starting Thursday in Pune. \n\"They produce good wickets, so looking forward to good five-day Test (pitches) that deteriorate over five days,\" Lehmann said.
