This decision was taken after a wave of terrorist attacks throughout the country which included the deadly suicide bombing in Lahore. \nThe Punjab government, following the decision of the province’s apex committee, has requested the interior ministry to lend around 2,000 Rangers for the next 60 to 90 days to assist counter-terror operations in the province. \nRangers will be deployed in Punjab to assist in a crackdown on extremists and they will be empowered independently to conduct intelligence-based operations (IBOs) throughout the province, The Express Tribune has learned. \nMehran airbase attacker taken down, claims Rangers \nThe decision was taken in a meeting of the province’s apex committee meeting after some sensitive information was shared with the participants. According to sources, the information revealed that it is necessary to carry out an immediate joint operation, particularly in South Punjab. \nPunjab Law Minister Rana Sanaullah said the decision to seek Rangers’ assistance would further streamline counter-terror operations already under way in Punjab. \nThe minister added that the decision was also aimed at dispelling opposition parties’ criticism of the Punjab government with regards to anti-terror ops. \nEnter the Rangers \nAccording to well-placed sources, the Rangers will conduct their operations based mainly on information passed on to the force by military intelligence sources. However, the paramilitary troops may decide not to share this information with police officials to prevent it from being leaked, the sources added. \nWhile they’re deployed in Punjab, the Rangers will have the power to detain or arrest anyone and will lodge FIRs with the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD), the sources said. \nThe Rangers will mainly focus on operations in South Punjab – particularly in Rajanpur and Dera Ghazi Khan, two districts which the police are found to be tough to operate in.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T14:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T09:27:56.695+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
