Mike Lee (R-Utah) said of the Gorsuch nomination. US President Donald Trump walks through the Cross Hall to the East Room to nominate Neil M. Gorsuch to take Justice Antonin Scalia's vacancy.

He’s a rockstar,” Sasse told the Daily News. “He’s a judge’s judge. Every American should be proud.” \nSen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) accused the GOP of “packing” the Supreme Court. \n“This is the first time in American history that one party has blockaded a nominee for almost a year in order to deliver a seat to a President of their own party,” Merkley said in a statement. U.S. President Donald Trump (R) shakes hands with Judge Neil Gorsuch after nominating him to the Supreme Court during a ceremony in the East Room.   \n“This is a stolen seat being filled by an illegitimate and extreme nominee, and I will do everything in my power to stand up against this assault on the Court.” \nSen. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.) echoed cries from the DNC for Gorsuch to \"explain his hostility to women's rights, support of corporations over workers and opposition to campaign finance reform.\" \nAnother failed presidential hopeful, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), urged Gorsuch’s confirmation and noted that in 2006, he was easily appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals in Denver under George W. Bush’s administration. \n\"I hope that each Democratic senator asks 'what's changed,' what is different from a judge they were prepared to confirm to the court of appeals... On any assessment of qualifications, on any assessment of his record being faithful to the law, Judge Gorsuch should be confirmed to the Supreme Court,” Cruz said. \nA spokeswoman for Trump’s pending Attorney General pick, Jeff Sessions, celebrated the SCOTUS nomination an early “Christmas” present for conservatives.
