By contrast, shares of Intellia Therapeutics and Crispr Therapeutics, which have licenses to the intellectual property from Dr. Doudna and her colleagues, each fell nearly 10 percent. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Those two companies, and others, may now have to negotiate licenses to the Broad patents, most likely by paying fees and royalties. It is rare in the medical field for one patent holder to block another party from bringing a medical treatment to market. There have been some exceptions, such as Amgen’s current effort to block a rival cholesterol-lowering drug. But the Broad Institute and the University of California have given every indication that they want Crispr to be applied widely for public benefit, so the ruling on Wednesday is unlikely to slow down research. Crispr is an acronym for a natural process used by bacteria to fight viruses. Dr. Doudna, along with Emmanuelle Charpentier, now of the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Germany, helped figure out how the process worked and demonstrated that the system could be used to cut DNA at any particular point in an organism’s genome. Their initial demonstration of the editing technique used chemicals in a test tube. Still, the publication of their paper in the summer of 2012 set off a rush to apply the technique to plant, animal and human cells. Several months later, Feng Zhang, a young scientist at the Broad Institute, was one of the first to accomplish the task. In a surprise to researchers in the field, the Broad Institute was granted a series of patents covering the use of the technique in cells that have nuclei, including human cells and plant cells. The University of California, along with Dr. Charpentier and the University of Vienna, where she once worked, challenged the patent award, and the patent office began a procedure, called an interference, to determine the rightful inventor. The University of California and its allies argued that once the technique had been demonstrated in the test tube, it was obvious that Crispr editing could be applied in human and plant cells with a little tweaking. The Broad Institute countered that significant inventive work was required by Dr. Zhang to get the technique to work in cells with nuclei. On Wednesday, a panel of three judges of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board sided with the Broad Institute, saying that the paper by Dr. Doudna and Dr. Charpentier did not provide a “reasonable expectation of success” that the technique would work in plant, animal and human cells. In a 51-page decision, the judges cited statements made in 2012 by experts in the field, including Dr. Doudna, saying that it was not yet known if the technique would work in human cells. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Still, Dr. Doudna and Dr. Charpentier have won various awards, a sign that many peers consider them to be pioneers in Crispr gene-editing. It remains to be determined if they can get their own patents and, if so, how broad they will be.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T07:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T02:47:43.886+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
