Related 20 Most Savage 'SNL' Political Impersonations From a vintage \"Klutz-in-Chief\" to Tea Party icons and a certain thin-skinned POTUS, these were the show's sharpest politico parodies \nIn the clip, suburban married couple Scott (Farrell) and Kate's (Poehler) daughter Alex (Ryan Simpkins) receives an acceptance letter to college and the couple quickly discovers they don't have money to cover the tuition. Their neighbor Frank (Jason Mantzoukas) proposes they turn the basement into an underground casino to make the cash. \nThe outlandish scheme includes a nail salon, a strip club room, a club-styled pool area, boxing matches and an 11-year-old DJ.
