There’s even a panel with backpack straps, for example, or a clip-on handle. Every space, pouch, and pocket has a distinct function: a place to keep all of your carry-on essentials , including business cards and a camera. \nIf you’re wondering why you haven’t heard of BrightLine Bags yet, it’s likely because they’re designed with aviation experts in mind (a convenient space for your pre-flight check list, a pocket for storing fuel testers, a zippered compartment for your headset). And to be sure, these bags prioritize function over design. They’re hardly the sleek, retro-inspired Rimowa Salsa Air . \nAs the president of BrightLine Bags told TravelPulse , the bags are purposefully marketed toward “the field professional,” like pilots and cops. Want to travel like a pro? It’s not as complicated as it sounds. BrightLine can get you started with pre-configured setups like the B7 Flight , or a slimmer arrangement called the B2 Compute . The B7 Flight, for instance, comes equipped with rear and front pockets, two center sections, and two side pockets. Read the original article on Travel + Leisure . Copyright 2017.
