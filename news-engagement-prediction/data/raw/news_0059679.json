Picture: Yuri Gripas Julie Bishop arrives at the White House with ‘strategic issues’ on the table for both nations Lena Bell, Washington DC, News Corp Australia Network February 22, 2017 10:01am \nFOREIGN Affairs Minister Julie Bishop has invited US Vice-President Mike Pence to visit Australia “as soon as possible.” \nMs Bishop met with Mr Pence at the White House on Tuesday to discuss a range of strategic challenges facing both countries. \nSpeaking to News Corp Australia, Ms Bishop said top of the agenda was the Australia-US relationship and the upcoming US review on Syria and Iraq sought by the new Trump administration. \n“Obviously we have a deep interest in any change of strategy or thinking on that (Syria and Iraq) so that was one of the issues that we discussed,” she said. \n“I took the opportunity to provide our thinking and ideas on what we’d like the review to address.” \nMs Bishop said both military and political solutions were discussed as part of a range of issues that need to be considered in determining an outcome in Iraq and Syria. \n“We have a very close defence and military strategic relationship with the US and the administration has been expressing its appreciation for the role Australia plays,” she said. \nThe visit follows soon after the controversy about the now infamous “worst call” between US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. \nAsked about Australia’s commitment to the Trans-Pacific Partnerhsip (TPP), Ms Bishop said that Australia was “very keen to maintain the principals and the spirit of the TPP both economically and strategically.” \nMr Trump walked away from the ambitious, 12-nation trade deal brokered by the Obama administration last month. He declared an end to the era of multinational trade agreements that have defined global economics for decades. \nIn her first face-to-face meeting with US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson scheduled for tomorrow, Ms Bishop is also expected to discuss Australia’s Mideast military commitment, as well as a regional response to North Korea.
