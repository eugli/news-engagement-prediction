Like in many businesses, additional value will be created through software, not hardware.\" \nThe cash offer, 3.04 euros per share, represents a premium of 29 percent compared with Comptel's last closing price. \nComptel's share price jumped to 3.06 euros, just above the offer price, suggesting some investors expect a higher bid, while Nokia's share price was up 1 percent at 4.59 euros by 0945 GMT. \n\"Even traditional software companies could be interested in the virtual networks, so there's plenty of potential buyers out there,\" Metsala said. \nComptel's board of directors, and shareholders that hold about 48 percent of the shares, backed the offer. \nLast year, Nokia bought Franco-American network maker Alcatel-Lucent in a 15.6 billion-euro all-share deal to broaden its product portfolio, and is now cutting thousands of jobs as it seeks to reduce costs. \nNokia earlier this month reported 27 percent fall in its quarterly earnings and said it expected the value of the global networks market to fall by around 2 percent this year. \n($1 = 0.9368 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T11:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:24:44.428+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
