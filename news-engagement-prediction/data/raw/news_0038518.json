Meet the people who have the job of catching one of the world's deadliest predators — the saltwater crocodile. \nThe Top End has been experiencing heavy rainfall over a substantial wet season, which has caused river levels to rise considerably. \nSaltwater crocodiles generally spend the wet season mating and then nesting; the males are much more mobile and the species as a whole is far more territorial at this time. They can also inhabit any waterway, including freshwater systems, billabongs, and lowland areas that are prone to flooding. \n\"You always know at this time of year when the river rises, especially when it starts to settle and slow down, it makes it an easy path for any size saltwater crocodile to move up from downstream into the gorge system,\" Mr McPhee said. \nWe've probably been more surprised in the last few years that we haven't caught any.\" 'We're just ready for 'em at any time' \nThe gorge system is popular with visitors who go boating, canoeing and even swimming, for the very brave.

(Suplpied: NT Government) \nBut Mr McPhee said the entire gorge system was closed for the wet season, and the first gorge had been closed for activities for the past two years. \n\"Part of our crocodile management plan is we will maintain one trap at the boat ramp in the first gorge by keeping it open, keeping it baited,\" he said. \n\"We're just ready for 'em at any time, and if we can clear him out now it's not going to stop any more coming in in the meantime. \n\"It's really just giving us the heads-up to what's coming up through the system.\" \nOnce the wet season is over, rangers usually spend a month around May conducting extensive surveys of the gorge by spotlighting, carrying out aerial surveys, and laying floats and traps through the entire gorge system. \n\"We are actively looking before we open anything [to the public]… we want to know what exactly is in that system when the water drops down low to a point that it makes it difficult for things to get in,\" Mr McPhee. \n\"At this time of year, it's the crocodiles' domain; they can come and go as they please, we can't stop them, but once the river drops off that's when our intensive management really kicks in for visitor safety.\" \nHe said all visitors should be paying attention to the usual croc-wise message: \"They're around, they can see you, you can't always see them, so it's just safety on the banks and river edges at all times.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T16:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T11:52:02.210+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
