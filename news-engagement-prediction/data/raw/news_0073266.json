But the ex-neighbours of Karen Matthews believe the convict wasn't the brainchild of her now-infamous scam. \nIn fact, according to a new Channel 5 documentary which will air on Tuesday at 10pm, those who knew the disgraced matriarch believe she was acting under instruction from somebody else - and that justice is yet to catch up with them. \nResidents of Dewsbury Moor insist that neither Karen nor her accomplice, Michael Donovan, were intelligent enough to organise the plot, in which they said 9 year-old Shannon Matthews had been abducted. \nNow, former friends of them both will reveal their theories - and urge Karen to come clean.

She says Matthews does not have the intelligence to have thought up such a cynical plan, that many believed was hatched to cash in on reward money. \nAnd the shop worker believes others involved in the false kidnap have created a shroud of silence around the case to protect themselves from prosecution. \nJulie said: “I think there are at least three other people who know far more than they let on. This is a horrible conspiracy of silence and it’s time for those people to speak out and tell the truth.

I’m not saying at all what she did was right, or that she was totally innocent, but she’s not evil. \n“Karen is a child in adult’s clothing and easily used and manipulated. \n“This was never about the reward money, something else was going on. We need the truth now.” \nMatthews also insisted in a Mirror interview there were “others” involved in the kidnap of her daughter on the estate where she lived in Dewsbury, West Yorks, and wants police to reinvestigate.

Karen at the time of her daughter Shannon's disappearance \nJulie, who is played by Sheridan Smith in BBC drama The Moorside about nine-year-old Shannon’s kidnap in March 2008, admits she is obsessed by the crime. \nShe admitted she was taken in by Matthews’ appalling lies during the hunt for the youngster, but started to have her suspicions after she was found alive. \nJulie added: “When Shannon was missing I was busy in the community centre sorting out the posters and supporting Karen. \n\"I was more concerned about finding Shannon and obsessed with keeping her name in the news.
