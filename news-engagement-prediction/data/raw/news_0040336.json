IAIN MCGREGOR/FAIRFAX NZ \nA helicopter protecting the house. \nDorrance was herding his cows away from the approaching fire, fearing the worst, when the cavalry arrived. \n\"Like everyone, I was peering at it from a distance,\" he said. \n\"There would have been about eight loaders and diggers charging up the hill, right next to the fire, doing fire breaks.\" \nThey powered \"literally through the fire,\" exposing themselves to significant danger, he said, while helicopter pilots flew above the flames with monsoon buckets. \nThe ordeal brought back memories of the earthquakes, when that same house had been destroyed. \nAfter five years of rebuilding, it looked to be destroyed once again – and it would have been if the firefighters hadn't risked their lives. \n\"I suspect many of them were also on hand in those terrible days post earthquake,\" Dorrance said. Ad Feedback \n\"These guys never seek the limelight and deserve considerable recognition. There absolutely needs to be something there for those pilots and the member of their team that went down.\" \nUntil he could get to his house, he couldn't be sure it was entirely undamaged, but it looked to be in \"great nick.\" \nSome of his neighbours had lost their homes. Others like him still had theirs – not because of luck, but because of bravery. \n\"There was a fireman who posted a Snapchat of himself in front of the house, and what I was told was, all those people were just so proud they had saved a house. I just think that's amazing. \n\"My home will always be an open and welcoming place to anyone who participated in its survival and that of the Spur. I mean that genuinely. \n\"They are the example for your kids to aspire to.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T12:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T08:02:57.359+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
