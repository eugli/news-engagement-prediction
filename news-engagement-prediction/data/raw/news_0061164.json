In a statement, Cuomo said the threats were \"now a national crisis\" because of their regularity.Trump condemned the previous threats as antisemitism for the first time on Tuesday after repeatedly declining to do so when asked by journalists last week. Some Jewish organizations have criticized his approach, saying they fear that the groups that supported Trump had become more active.The attack on Chesed Shel Emeth was widely interpreted as motivated by antisemitic animus, although the perpetrators have not been identified.Muslim Americans have helped raise more than $84,000 to repair the vandalized headstones at the cemetery in St. Louis, according to an online fundraising page.More than 3,000 people had donated $84,261 as of Wednesday afternoon. Cemetery staff declined to comment. Reuters contributed to this report.
