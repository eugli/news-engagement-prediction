The National Security Council debated how to implement the measures and “sought approval from the president,” officials said. \nGood. \nIt’s about time someone stands up to Iran for a change. \nCheck out this great sound bite from earlier this week. \nBig league.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T02:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T00:48:17.461+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
