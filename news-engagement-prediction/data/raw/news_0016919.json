Cycle crash: the aftermath of the collision in the Docklands \nMr Wales was a father of two young children, aged three and five, from Erith, Kent, who had taken part in last year’s Surrey to London charity bike ride to raise money for children suffering with cancer. \nHis wife Sarah today told the Standard: “He was a diamond. He put me and our children first. He was a devoted father and husband and we are going to be lost without him. \n“He was the kindest person you could meet. He would do anything for anyone. Cycling was a passion of his and he loved and support West Ham. His kids were the world to him.” \nWitnesses said Mr Wales was dragged at least 20 yards beneath the lorry’s wheels before the driver was alerted by oncoming motorists. \nInvestigation: The road was cordoned off after the crash (Jay Stewart) \nA passing bus driver pulled up and attempted to save him but when paramedics arrived on the Greenshield Industrial Estate at 1.30pm yesterday he was pronounced dead. \nScotland Yard said the lorry driver stopped at the scene, near Silvertown West DLR station, and was not arrested. \nMr Wales’ colleagues today spoke of their devastation. One said: “He was a lovely man and a very nice guy. He was a hard worker who had been here a couple of years.” \nFactory manager Craig Bennett added: “Ben was a valued member of our team since 2015. In that time he made a big impression on us all and was well loved by his colleagues. \n“Our thoughts are with his young family. He will be sorely missed by us all.” \nAnita Szucs, 30, suffered fatal injuries in a suspected hit-and-run \nThe week of bloodshed began when Anita Szucs, 30, died after a suspected hit and run crash in Edmonton in the early hours on Monday. \nSeven hours later architect Karla Roman, 32, was killed in a crash with a coach on a cycle superhighway in Whitechapel. \nThousands of cycle campaigners are expected to join a “die-in” outside the Treasury in Whitehall tomorrow to protest about the deaths. Cyclist Karla Roman, who moved to London in 2012 \nSimon Munk, of the London Cycling Campaign, said: “It’s such a large, tragic waste of life in such quick succession.” \nLeon Daniels, Transport for London’s managing director of surface transport, said: “Our thoughts are with the families and friends of those who have tragically lost their lives on London’s roads this week. \n“Any death or serious injury on our roads is one too many, and our priority is to eradicate them.” \nThe Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: “I was saddened to learn of the tragic deaths on London’s roads this week. My thoughts are with their families and friends at this difficult time. \n“As Mayor, I’m determined to make cycling safer and easier for all Londoners. That’s why we’re addressing the most dangerous junctions, increasing the number of safer cycle lanes, working with boroughs to introduce more 20mph limits and removing the most dangerous lorries from our streets. \n“I’ve allocated more investment for cycling than ever before and appointed the capital’s first ever full-time Walking and Cycling Commissioner to drive forward these improvements.” More about: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T17:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T12:54:28.940+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
