Cllr Davies said around 30 disgruntled residents had turned out for a council site visit because they were unhappy about the timings of noise assessments being taken. Villagers say their anger is compounded by smaller helicopters bringing members of the Rifles regiment from the nearby Beachley barracks at Sedbury to the centre. The councillor added homeowners are so upset that they are reviving a residents' association and say councillors visited the site on days when a zip wire at the centre was not being used. Villagers say their anger is compounded by smaller helicopters flying over the village, pictured, bringing members of the Rifles regiment from the nearby Beachley barracks at Sedbury The SAS use the National Diving Centre, pictured, near Tidenham for training purposes Residents have asked why they cannot land elsewhere and then get a bus to the centre, pictured He added: 'These people live in high class developments and have spent a lot of money because they want to live in peace and quiet in a rural area. They don't want to hear people screeching and helicopters coming and going. 'Why can't they land at the barracks in Beachley and then bus them up to the diving centre? 'They don't mind people using the zip wire either, as long as they shut up and stop shouting.' One resident, who asked not to be named, said: 'When the Chinooks come this way it shakes all the glasses in my house. It's incredibly noisy.' Another, Geoffrey Mead, 73, who's lived in the village for 50 years, said: 'I'm used to it but I can hear it now and again. 'It doesn't bother me too much, but then I'm hard of hearing.' Jean Walmsley added: 'My dog doesn't like them, I think it's the noise.' But supporters say the diving centre on the A48 between Lydney and Chepstow provides jobs, attracts visitors from across the country. This map shows how the SAS fly troops 40 miles to the National Diving Centre in Gloucestershire, near the small village Locals said they had 'spent lots of money to live in a quiet and peaceful area'. Pictured is main road through the village Writing online, Leah Parker said: 'You'll soon be moaning if we had no air defences at all. 'You wouldn't be living in your posh bloody houses if it wasn't for our armed forces and all they do. You people haven't got a clue.' And Jake Tunnicliff said: 'Oh dear the snobs have been disturbed.' Sarah Slattery, who has complained about the zip wire passing behind trees at the end of her garden, said she cannot bear the 'whooping, shouting and swearing' of those using it. Ms Slattery claims she can hear people using the wire even when she closes the windows of her four-bedroom home, which is around 100 metres away. She added she feared being forced to move from the house she has lived in since 1989. In a letter to the Forest of Dean District Council, she said she would be 'regaled with screams of terror, mock or otherwise, whoo-hoos and loud expletives'. She added: 'We are the nearest property. The zipwire is literally at the bottom of our garden and throughout spring, summer and autumn it goes constantly. 'People obviously scream, sometimes they scream profanities, women particularly love to scream hysterically. One is bad enough, but a second one - no thank you very much.' The SAS troops are flown to the Gloucestershire village from their base in Hereford, pictured Supporters say the diving centre on the A48 between Lydney and Chepstow provides jobs, attracts visitors from all over the country and even helps people raise money for charity. One supporter wrote: 'I must say that I am surprised to hear this as the zip wire makes hardly any noise apart from a member of the public cheering when they come down the zip wire as they have enjoyed the experience so much. 'I think the zip wire has put the centre on the map and has helped its continued growth locally with the extra employment and jobs.' The diving centre has previously declined to comment on the row over the zip wire, which is described on its website as one of the UK's longest, tallest and fastest slides. The popular activity centre also has a 3G swing, wigwam village and outdoor cinema.
