(AFP Photo) \nIn a wheelchair since birth due to a spinal cord injury, she had struggled for years to make it as a model in the ex-Soviet state where disabled people all too often get left behind. \nKutas sent letters to modelling agencies -- but the response was always the same polite refusals. \n“They told me that I am very pretty, but they do not know how to promote me because the market is still not ready for this”, says Kutas. \n‘Huge inspiration’ \nKutas was born in Dnipro city, in the east of Ukraine, and went to an ordinary school. It was a bold step to take in 2000, when inclusive education was rare.

(AFP Photo) \nThere were no ramps or elevators for special needs children in schools, so Kutas’s father or grandfather had to carry her up the stairs so that she could study with the other children. \n“Yes, it was difficult, but it is generally difficult to be a person with limited physical mobility in our country. Everyone knows that,” Kutas says. \nIn 2012, Kutas was having lunch in a cafe when a photographer approached her and asked if she wanted to become a model. \nShe agreed and loved the process of having her picture taken so much that she soon began looking for other photographers to work with. \n“When I realised that I wanted to do this, there did not seem to be a single model with a disability in the world”, Kutas says, recalling how she conducted a search for role models to follow and found none.

(AFP Photo) \nAnd then she suddenly came across a 1999 show of Alexander McQueen, the late British designer, where Aimee Mullins, a world-class Paralympic athlete, modelled in his statuesque and beautiful prosthetic legs. \n“It was a huge stimulus for me, a huge inspiration. I wondered why, if it was possible back then, in 1999, why it could not be possible now for a girl in the wheelchair?” \nWhen the Italian house FTL Moda invited models with disabilities to participate in New York Fashion Week recently, Kutas felt that the world was finally ready for a change. \n‘Potential is hidden’ \nFedir Vozianov, a 55-year-old Ukrainian designer, never expected the domestic market to be ready for such a dramatic change. \nBut when he met Kutas and saw her confidence, Vozianov says he understood that he, himself, was willing to give it a go.

(AFP Photo) \n“People are not all the same -- we are all different in this world”, Vozianov says. \n“It would be strange to cut a part of this world off at the podium.” \nToday Kutas is not only a rising model, but also an adviser to the mayor in her native city. \nShe helps to adapt the city to the needs of disabled people, which is especially important due to the conflict between government forces and Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine’s east that has claimed more than 10,000 lives and wounded 23,000 people. \n“I know that now is the moment that Ukraine simply cannot miss,” she says. \n“It is always possible to grow, to evolve, to do something. The main thing is to create the conditions for these people whose great potential is hidden”. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T20:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T17:04:36.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
