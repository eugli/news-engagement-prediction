Photo: Mr Azon's plea to the thief resulted in the return of his boot, but not the backpack. (Supplied) \n\"I would like to present two options to you. One, please give everything back especially the boot. \n\"Two, if you really want to keep my stuff and simply don't want to give it back â€” then I'm going to leave the other boot by my front gate.\" \nJust hours after leaving the letter behind, Mr Azon was surprised when his left hiking boot made a miraculous return, sat neatly beside the right one in front of his gate. \n\"I haven't seen someone contact a robber before and thought 'what's there to lose?' I think it worked because I came back yesterday and the boot was sitting with the other shoe,\" he said. \n\"He took the high road, now I'm just waiting to see if I can get my backpack.\" Photo: Mr Azon hopes the beer will entice the robber to return his backpack. (ABC News: Supplied) \nA second letter written to the thief read: \n\"Update, In what can only be described as a really strange turn of events I arrived home today to find that the thief (with a heart of solid gold) had returned the show to my front door. \n\"Dear dude, who pinched and returned my boot, either you have a great (albeit confusing) code of ethics, or we simply just have a different foot size. \n\"Either way I feel very, very grateful to you, and I don't want to push the ticket any further, but while we are at it, may I please have my backpack as well? \n\"I know you probably love it, and maybe at this stage you feel like its yours ... that's fine, and in a way I feel like you kind of deserve it ... but I do still really want it and kind of need it for a big trip I'm doing soon.\" \nMr Azon has replaced the pair of boots with a six-pack of beer hoping this will convince the thief to return the remainder of his belongings. \nMolle Street residents have come together to offer Mr Azon more beer for the bounty. \nMr Azon hoped to use the boots and backpack for an upcoming trip to Nepal in March where he wants to volunteer while enjoying his 30th birthday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T05:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:58:06.594+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
