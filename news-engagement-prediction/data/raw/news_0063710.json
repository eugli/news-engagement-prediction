Close Cyclist takes revenge on sleezy driver but raises suspicions too UP NEXT \nOn face value, the video has everything to set social media commentary ablaze - a young woman on a bicycle comes face to face with some handsy and provocative men in a van at some traffic lights. \nA motorcyclist with a camera is right there to capture their unwelcome advances and her swift revenge. At one stage one of then in the van appears to reach out to touch the woman. Photo: Screenshot \nThe video shows the woman appearing to angrily reject the advances of the men in the car, before following them, filming bike in tow, for two blokes. \nWhen they stop, she swiftly deprives the van of it's right wing mirror. The man filming from the motorcycle tells the \"scum\" it is \"what they deserve\". \nThe perfect cyclist revenge video? Well, maybe and maybe not. The camera also arrives, just in time, two blocks away to see the angry cyclist extra vegeance from the van's wing mirror. Photo: Screenshot \nCommenters have been quick to point out a few suspicious issues, including the crystal clear audio, the van's ability to outrun the cycle but the motorbike's failure to do likewise and, finally, the fact the video has since been found to be in the hands of Viral Thread, which is now trying to monetise it. \nOf course, the other argument is that it is what it says it is, and this stunning piece of swift and decisive rejection has somehow been caught in all its glory.
