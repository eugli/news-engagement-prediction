Taking clear photos of the incident at the time and quickly writing down notes of what was observed can prove to be critical in investigations.\" \nAnyone with information can phone 0800 DOC HOT (0800 362 462). - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T10:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T05:58:32.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
