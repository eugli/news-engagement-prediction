Goose Gossage (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 5:19 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 5:19 p.m. ET \nDon't ask Goose Gossage what he thinks about the game of baseball today. \nIf you do, be prepared for some off-color remarks from the hall of fame pitcher, one of the most feared closers of the 1970s and ’80s. \nMORE: Nine rising MLB stars who could break out in 2017 \nIn an extensive interview this week with NJ Advance Media , Gossage vented his frustration with many aspects of today's game … especially the way relievers are used. When the reporter asked Gossage what he thought about the Yankees re-signing Aroldis Chapman, Gossage said, \"Well, they're one-inning guys.\" \nWhen NJ Advance Media noted he used to pitch three-inning stints as a reliever, Gossage agreed. \n\"Yeah, it's totally different, so don't even compare me here,\" Gossage said. \"Chapman's great. Mo (Rivera) was great ... for one inning.\" \nSo right there, Gossage dissed two of this generation's premier closers. It got even better — or worse, depending on your perspective — with colorful exchanges such as this: \nReporter: \"You mention Mo, but I think he was the one guy who at least was used in the eighth at times by Joe Torre.\" \nGossage: \"Bull—! ... That's postseason. He never did it ... Very seldom in the (bleeping) regular season.\" \nGossage continued, \"Don't compare me to Mo or what they do today. They're one-inning guys. I take exception to that. Don't even (bleeping) put me ... closer wasn't even a coined phrase.\" \nGossage also shared his disdain for the way he says pitchers are \"babied\" today with pitch counts and specific roles. \nAnd don't even get him started on how today's general managers rely on sabremetrics. \n\"And they won their rotisserie leagues at (bleeping) Harvard and all these (bleeping) Ivy League schools, and that's all it is,\" Gossage said. \"And they think they're (bleeping) general managers!\" \nIt's not the first time Gossage has ranted about the state of today's game. As long as there are reporters with copy to file and down time in spring training, it probably won't be the last.
