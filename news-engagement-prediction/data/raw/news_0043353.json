It's one of two homes on Hawthorne Street on this week's council agenda.\nA bit of north-end Halifax in Dartmouth When the SS Mont-Blanc and SS Imo collided on Dec. 6, 1917, the resulting explosion destroyed entire neighbourhoods in Halifax and Dartmouth. The Halifax Relief Commission arranged to have established architecture firm Ross and Macdonald work with Scottish city planner Thomas Adams to rebuild the damaged areas.\nRoss and Macdonald created several new home designs for single families. Many were built in Halifax's north end using hydrostone — a fire-resistant concrete block manufactured in Eastern Passage. Other homes were rebuilt with wood.\nMost shared a fusion of characteristics and resembled English cottages.\n68 Hawthorne is the only house on that street designed by Ross and Macdonald, who'd already designed the Château Laurier in Ottawa and Fort Garry Hotel in Winnipeg. They would later become known for Maple Leaf Gardens, Toronto's Union Station and others.\nHouse built for sister of philanthropist The home at 68 Hawthorne Street was built for Annie Leedham, sister to philanthropist George Wright. (Nova Scotia Archives)\nThe house was built for Annie Leedham, sister to businessman and philanthropist George Wright. Wright was the only Halifax resident on the Titanic who was living in the city at the time the ship sank. He left his Young Avenue home to the Halifax Local Council of Women in his will.\nLeedham's home on Windmill Road was destroyed in the explosion. Her daughter owned the parcel of land on which 68 Hawthorne Street was built.\nThe research report says most homes on Hawthorne Street survived the explosion.\nRead the city's full research report about 68 Hawthorne St., Dartmouth", "external_links": ["http://www.halifax.ca/council/agendasc/documents/170221ca1433.pdf"], "published": "2017-02-20T00:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T01:33:42.770+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
