Because Democrats serve corporate interests,” Stein tweeted. \nThis assertion is laughable almost to the point of being fraudulent. There are 48 Democrats in the U.S. Senate; they not only all voted against DeVos – along with two Republicans – but they spent the entire night filibustering her. DeVos isn’t the new education secretary because Democrats are corporate shills but because there are more Republicans than Democrats in the Senate. This is civics 101 stuff that Stein (perhaps not unreasonably) seems to think her supporters are too ill-informed to understand. DeVos was confirmed because 51>50. There's not much you can do in the face of that math. \nMore broadly – and this is where recent history, like last fall, comes in – the egregiously unqualified DeVos wouldn’t have been nominated if Clinton had won the presidency last November. (And that's just one of an exponentially growing number of obvious differences between what a Clinton administration would have looked like and the actually unfolding Trump fiasco.) Stein of course campaigned on the idea that Clinton and Trump were corporate peas in a pod, ideologically indistinguishable. I don’t think I’m heading way out on a limb when I suggest that whomever Clinton would have nominated as education secretary would have been vastly better qualified than DeVos. \nSo faced with incontrovertible evidence that she was wrong, Stein should have the common decency to admit error – or failing that let silence bespeak her shame – rather than making specious attacks against people actually working to fight the monster she helped unleash.
