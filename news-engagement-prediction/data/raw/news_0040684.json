After initial court appearances, additional charges were filed Thursday in Green County court. \nDiamond Rikki Madison, 21, of the 200 block of Gregory Street, Aurora, is charged with operating a vehicle while fleeing or eluding an officer, a Class I felony; burglary to a building or dwelling, a Class F felony; theft of movable property valued at greater than $10,000, a Class G felony; and criminal damage to property, a Class A misdemeanor, according to Green County court records. \nAlexis Marie Beyer, 18, of the 100 block of West Galena Boulevard, Aurora, is charged with operating a vehicle while fleeing or eluding an officer, a Class I felony; burglary to a building or dwelling, a Class F felony; theft of movable property valued at greater than $10,000, a Class G felony; and criminal damage to property, a Class A misdemeanor, according to Green County court records \nStraight cash bonds for both Madison and Beyer have been set at $15,000 with the conditions of no contact with the Monroe Radio Shack and the defendants to remain within Kane and DuPage counties, except for purposes of meeting with counsel and for court appearances. \nMichael Lavell Bush Jr., 25, of the 2200 block of Reflection Drive, Aurora, is charged with burglary to a building or dwelling, a Class F felony; theft of movable property valued at $10,000, a Class G felony; and criminal damage to property, a Class A misdemeanor. \nTynario Rashard Brown, 21, of the 400 block of Spruce Street, Aurora, is also charged with burglary to a building or dwelling, a Class F felony; theft of movable property valued at $10,000, a Class G felony; and criminal damage to property, a Class A misdemeanor. \nStraight cash bond for Brown and Bush is set at $20,000 with the same conditions as Madison and Beyer. \nKneirah Victoria Johnson, 18, of the 2400 block of Prairie Crossing Drive, Montgomery, is charged with burglary to a building or dwelling, a Class F felony; theft of movable property valued at $10,000, a Class G felony; and criminal damage to property, a Class A misdemeanor. \nJohnson has been assigned a combination $2,500 cash and $2,500 signature bond, meaning she must post $2,500 to get out, but she must also sign for another $2,500, which she could have to forfeit for violating any of her conditions. Johnson was given the same conditions as Brown and Bush. \nAll five are next to appear for a preliminary hearing at 1:30 p.m. Feb. 23 on the second floor of the Green County court building. \nAccording to police, the five are charged in connection with the burglary of a Radio Shack in Monroe at 2:49 a.m. Tuesday. A witness told police that five people, dressed in black with their faces concealed, ran out of the closed Radio Shack \"carrying items.\" Some got into a Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV and others got into a Kia Optima sedan and drove off, according to a news release. \nAfter about two miles, Monroe police and Green County Sheriff's Office vehicles caught up to the getaway cars and began a pursuit, which continued at high speeds east on State Highway 11, according to the news release. \nOfficers' reports indicate at least during the first half of the chase, speeds were close to 100 miles an hour at points, Kelley said. \nNear Highway 11 and County Highway OK, the Sheriff's Office deployed tire deflation devices to stop the cars, according to Monroe police. \nThe devices, called stop sticks, don't immediately blow out the tires, but cause air to rush out of the tires within about a hundred yards, Kelley said. \nOne car ran over the devices and continued on flat tires for about a mile before stopping, where the driver, Beyer, was taken into custody, according to police. Three other suspects ran from the Jeep south into farm fields and remain at large, according to the news release. \nMeanwhile, the other car continued east on Highway 11 into Rock County, according to the news release. Attempts to stop the vehicle with tire deflation devices were made, and finally in Janesville, the vehicle's tires were deflated and it was stopped by Rock and Green county deputies, Janesville police and Brodhead police, according to the news release. \nThe driver, Diamond Rikki Madison, 21, of Aurora, and passengers, Michael Lavell Bush Jr., 25, of Aurora, Tynario Rashard Brown, 21, of Aurora, and Kneirah V. Johnson, 18, of Montgomery, were all taken into custody, according to police. \nInitial reports indicate that about $90,000 worth of cellphones and equipment were taken from the Radio Shack, \"a large amount\" of which may have been recovered, according to police. \nAs for what the Aurora area residents were doing in Monroe, the chief said, \"Our guess would be for criminal reasons.\" \nTwitter @hannahmleone", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T08:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T03:52:57.160+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
