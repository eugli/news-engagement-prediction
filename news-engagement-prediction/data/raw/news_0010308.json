Eugene Galekovic. Source: FOX SPORTS \nFox Sports’ Daniel Garb confirmed Adelaide suspected Galekovic had sustained a suspected torn lateral muscle in his shoulder, which could see him spend more time on the sidelines. \nThat would be a serious blow for the Reds, who have a hectic schedule coming up. \nHome games against Perth and Newcastle are followed by Adelaide’s first AFC Champions League game on February 22, an away trip to Melbourne Victory then an away trip to Jiangsu Suning. \nTo make things worse, Reds deputy John Hall was caught out of position just moments later. \nCaught in no man’s land, Hall blocked an initial shot but when his defence failed to clear the ball, he was out of position, with former Red Fabio Ferreira on hand to score. Mariners punish Reds sub 1:15 \nTo rub things in, Hall blocked away a later chance on goal, only for Kwabena Appiah to follow the ball in and put away the Mariners’ second. \nThose two goals, despite a late consolation, proved enough to confirm Adelaide’s ninth straight winless away trip. \nIZZO SHINES AFTER COPPING KNOCK \nCENTRAL Coast goalkeeper Paul Izzo has been one of the shining lights of the Mariners’ season. \nThis game was no exception. \nIzzo made six saves for the day, with several absolutely exceptional — including one reflex save where he stuck out a boot to deny Ben Garuccio from close range. \nHe stopped Mark Ochieng and Sergio Cirio within a matter of minutes, with the latter’s shot seeing him cop a ball to the face in the 51st minute. \nIzzo was down momentarily receiving treatment for the hit, with speculation as to whether he needed to come off. Was Izzo concussed? 0:59 \nThe goalkeeper was able to continue, with Garb reporting the Mariners’ medical staff had determined Izzo didn’t required a full concussion test. \nHe was called into action just minutes later, denying Cirio in the 58th minute. \nThe young goalkeeper was deservedly named Fox Sports’ player of the match and said he’d recovered from the initial daze of the hit. \n“I was a bit dazed for a bit,” he said. \n“I had to figure out where I was and check out the score for a minute but I was okay, I got through it.” \nWHEN BACKING PLAYERS IN PAYS OFF \nWHEN you’re in the bottom two, sometimes you’ve just got to back in youth. \nThat’s something Paul Okon has done all season and it’s an approach Amor has taken in recent weeks as well. O'Doherty's sublime score 0:31 \nIn this game, faith in youth paid off in spades. \nThe likes of O’Doherty and Riley McGree were lively for the Reds, with O’Doherty providing a masterful finish to give Adelaide a consolation goal. \nBut one player — 24-year-old Appiah — summed up the approach of backing players in. \nPlaying his 53rd A-League game, Appiah came off the bench and scored with a superb strike, which proved to be his first A-League goal.
