I was shopping at Westgate just now, and helper was carrying my baby. Suddenly I heard my baby scream loudly, and my helper pointed out to me that this woman just pinched him really hard on his cheeks even after she turned away from her. \nI went up to confront her and she denied, till I told her that I'm going to lodge a police report only then she admitted. She said she found him cute thats why she pinched him. \nNo police report made as she mentioned she had a father to take care of at home. Why does such people even exist? LO's face is still red till now Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
