Jolly LLB 2 Review: Akshay does complete justice! February 10, 2017 14:58 IST \nJolly LLB did well with its droll depiction of a small-time lawyer and how his guilty conscience encourages him in vindicating the downtrodden. In its sequel, Akshay Kumar does it even better, feels Sukanya Verma. Saddled by bureaucracy, corruption and apathy, no fight for justice is prompt or pleasant. \nBut when formulated for mainstream Hindi films, it acquires the personality of a ham reveling in its inflated sentimentality or silliness till it hits the point of parody or propaganda. If clever, the upshot is sure-fire applause. \nBollywood’s allegiance to this method may not be above predictability but when armed with dollops of sarcasm, eloquence and last minute bombshells, courtroom trials provide a great source of gratification if not a guarantee for reform. \nDirector Subhash Kapoor’s Jolly LLB did well with its droll depiction of a small-time lawyer (played by Arshad Warsi) and how his guilty conscience encourages him in vindicating the downtrodden. \nBut its sequel starring a standout Akshay Kumar does it even better. \nThe story is more or less the same except around sharper wit seasoned in authentic local flavours that scorns at the intense rot eating up a noble profession without whitewashing the rascality of its titular character. \nThe full review will follow in just a bit. \nRediff Rating: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T12:40:09.885+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
