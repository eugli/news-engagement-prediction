Dwight Howard (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 8:49 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 8:49 a.m. ET \nThe NBA worked quickly in jumping to Dwight Howard's defense after the Hawks center was ejected in Monday night's 114-98 win against the Celtics. \nHoward was ejected late in the third quarterÂ after receiving his second technical foul, for taunting, after hanging on the rim following a massive dunk. The NBA said later Monday night that the play shouldÂ have been ruled \"non-unsportsmanlike\" and thus not have counted toward an automatic ejection. \nHoward finished with 17 points and 12 rebounds in 28 minutes of action. \n\"Despite me getting kicked out, I think guys really stepped up and played great; it was a good team win,\" Howard said, via ESPN.com . \"I apologized to the guys and told them I need to do a better job of keeping my composure and some other things, and they understood.\" \nThis is what Howard got ejected for, as you can see, it's pretty weak: 2nd: Dwight vs. The Rim đ pic.twitter.com/cpnpPuSMSZ â Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) February 28, 2017 \nHoward then gave hisÂ jersey away as a souvenier.
