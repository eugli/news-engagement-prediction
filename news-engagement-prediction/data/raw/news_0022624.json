He was taken to Methodist Hospital, where he later died. \nInvestigators were able to identify a suspect using tips from residents who had seen the story on the news, according to police. \nInvestigators were granted an arrest warrant for 30-year-old Brittney Jones on Feb. 3 for her alleged involvement in the accident. She was arrested Thursday on a preliminary charge of leaving the scene of an accident causing death. \nJones is scheduled to appear in court for an initial hearing on Feb. 13, according to online court records. \nCall IndyStar reporter Holly Hays at (317) 444-6156.
