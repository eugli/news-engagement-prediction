This week's ubiquitous DJ Khaled made a loud entrance, Snapchatting along the way. Actor Anthony Anderson, coach Rex Ryan, and commentator Stephen A. Smith soon followed after Khaled. \nMost notably New York Giants receiver Odell Beckham Jr. skipped the fanfare and ducked into the party. Reality star Kendra Wilkinson made a quick red carpet appearance and made her way inside. \nHouston Astros ace Dallas Keuchel, whose trademark beard looked fantastic as ever, told Chron.com that he's a Tom Brady fan but he thinks the future Hall of Famer might not earn that sixth ring on Sunday. \n\"I'm a Tom Brady fan but I'm thinking the Falcons are going to take it I really do,\" Keuchel said. \nGood news Astros fans, his arm is feeling great after an injuring plagued 2016 campaign. \n\"The arm's feeling good and I got my first bullpen the other day,\" he said. \nMinnesota Vikings running back and Texas native Adrian Peterson arrived in a studded black hoodie, joining ESPN legend Chris Berman on the red carpet nearby. \nHeadliner Fergie arrived in a blue dress and did a turn for assembled and smoldered for the cameras. \nOutside just after midnight the likes of Michael Irvin and Tim Tebow were wading through security to get into the party.
