Daily Edition February 02, 2017 2:24pm PT by Ryan Parker 'South Park' to Back Off Trump Administration: \"They’re Already Going Out and Doing the Comedy\" Comedy Central 'South Park' \"It’s really tricky now as satire has become reality,” says co-creator Trey Parker. \nMatt Stone and Trey Parker likely are going to back off Donald Trump next season in South Park because it is just too exhausting for the Comedy Central cartoon to keep up with the outlandishness of the actual president. \nParker and Stone discussed the plan during a Thursday interview with ABC News in Australia while the two were in Melbourne promoting their Broadway hit, The Book of Mormon . \n“It feels like it’s going to be more difficult,” Stone said of an attempt to keep up with Trump from week to week. \nParker added, “They’re already going out and doing the comedy. It’s not something you can make fun of.” \nFor the past few seasons, the show has poked fun at Trump more and more through the character of Mr. Garrison who remained himself, but became like Trump, even running for, and finally winning, the presidency. \nIt seems the duo, who met in film school at the University of Colorado decades ago, wanted to run with the Trump campaign gag until it ran out of gas. The only problem is it never did. In fact, major rewrites to an episode immediately after the election had to occur because it was constructed on the assumption Hillary Clinton would be the victor. \n“It’s really tricky now as satire has become reality,” said Parker. \"In the last season of South Park ... we were really trying to make fun of what was going on but we couldn’t keep up. What was actually happening was way funnier than anything we could come up with. So we decided to just back off and let [the politicians] do their comedy and we’ll do ours.” \nThe timing for the interview about the matter could not have been better as Australia is in the news after Trump gave the country's prime minister grief over his willingness to accept refugees, which Trump is against. \nAlso new for the past few years, the 10-episode run of the series was connected through a single story thread with multiple offshoots, which Parker and Stone told The Hollywood Reporter previously they enjoyed being able to do since they didn't have to worry about people watching in syndication thanks to all the streaming options. \nHowever, it seems like the single story arc idea may be done. The final episode of last season was titled \"The End of Serialization as We Know It.\" Ryan Parker", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T01:36:19.918+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
