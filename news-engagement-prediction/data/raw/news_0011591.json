That’s a measure of social actions tracked for each ad spot on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and iSpot.tv’s own platform. \nOn Twitter, “Stranger Things” generated 307,000 tweets between 6.30 p.m. and 11 p.m ET on Sunday, according to marketing analytics firm Amobee — more than three times the next closest advertiser.
