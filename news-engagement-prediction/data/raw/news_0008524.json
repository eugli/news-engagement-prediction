Instead, his Opportunity Party chief of staff Geoff Simmons has put his name forward to run in the February 25 by-election. \nSpeaking in Mt Albert, Morgan said the decision of National and other parties not to contest the by-election meant \"there's an opportunity here to do something for the people of Mt Albert\".

Derek Flynn \nLabour Party MP Jacinda Ardern is the heavy favourite for the February 25 by-election in Mt Albert. \nMorgan acknowledged the party's campaign would be \"a bit of a David and Goliath\", with both Labour and the Greens having an established party machinery. \nWhen he launched Top last November, Morgan said the party would be list-only, with no electorate candidates. \"I'm only happy with five per cent...I want to be there in sufficient numbers to have influence.\" \nArdern, the frontrunner for the by-election, has already welcomed Morgan's potential challenge, with colleague Grant Robertson alluding to the millionaire's campaign against cats in a message on Twitter. \nIn January Morgan revealed he was reconsidering his party list-only approach after \"being approached by some pretty outstanding candidates who wish to stand in electorates\". \n\"While personally I don't want to go near Parliament without a significant mandate for progress, there are both younger and regionally-oriented people already amongst our membership who would form a great ongoing parliamentary team.\" \nEach proposal to run in an electorate would be assessed on its merits, Morgan said. \nThe Mt Albert by-election was triggered by the resignation of Labour MP David Shearer, who has taken up a job at the United Nations in South Sudan. \nGreen MP Julie Anne Genter has also put her name forward to replace Shearer in the seat. \nThe close of nominations for by-election comes as Prime Minister Bill English prepares to announce the date for the 2017 election on Wednesday afternoon. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T05:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:24:17.304+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
