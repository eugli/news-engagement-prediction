The projects will focus on the stranger-than-fiction come-from-behind win in Super Bowl LI, and they will include the #DeflateGate saga. \nThe writers for the book/film combo, Paul Tamasy, Eric Johnson, and Dave Wedge, already have reportedly “cultivated several sources” within the team to provide information about what happened behind the scenes. \nIt’s unknown when the book and film will be available for purchase.
