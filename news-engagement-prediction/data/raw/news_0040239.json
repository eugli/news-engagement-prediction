YOUTUBE/OSCARS \nWeta Digital's Iain Matthews, Luca Fascione, and JP Lewis received a Scientific and Technical Oscar for their \"Facets\" technology. \nEighteen scientific and technical achievements were recognised at the ceremony at the Beverly Wilshire in Beverly Hills, with the awards' chairman Ray Feeney saying the recipients' work greatly expanded filmmakers' creative choices for storytelling. \n\"This year we are particularly pleased to be able to honour not only a wide range of new technologies, but also the pioneering digital cinema cameras that helped facilitate the widespread conversion to electronic image capture for motion picture production,\" he said. \nUnlike other Oscar awards, the successes recognised at the Scientific and Technical Awards do not need to have been developed in the previous year. \nBut they must prove to have contributed significantly to the process of making motion pictures. Ad Feedback \nOther recipients included Brian Whited for the \"Meander\" drawing system at Disney, and Glenn Sanders and Howard Stark for the \"Zaxcom Digital Wireless Microphone System\". \nWeta Digital also received the Best Special Visual Effects BAFTA at the EE British Academy Film Awards at the weekend for its involvement with Disney's The Jungle Book. The Miramar company is also up for the visual effects award for the Oscar's main event on February 26. \nFor more information about the Oscar's Scientific and Technical Awards, and to see the full list of recipients, see Oscars.org . - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T01:07:11.758+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
