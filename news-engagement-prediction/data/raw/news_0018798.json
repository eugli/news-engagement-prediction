It is likely to be another 'voter-less' 'one-sided' election.\" \nReferring to the statements of Nurul Huda, which came after the new election commissioners were announced, Rizvi termed Nurul as \"a committed Awami Leager.\" \n\"Yesterday, I saw on Facebook that he is eating sweets to celebrate the victory of some UP chairman in his zone. The former CECs maintained their distinct personality and independent entity. They did not participate in such events,\" said the BNP leader.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T07:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:06:17.228+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
