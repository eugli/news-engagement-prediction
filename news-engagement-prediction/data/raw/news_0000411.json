Or that’s what I tell myself at my desk, as I pause to examine the wrinkled, tear-shaped nut in my hand. Untold hundreds I’ve probably crushed in my working life, knocking back two and three at a time as my fingers drifted back and forth to the keyboard, but have I ever really looked? Listened? Tasted? It doesn’t take a forensic expert—just an observant IT guy with an eye for stray crumbs—to guess where I spend too many meals. I know that emails make dull dining companions, that table manners wither in the glare of the screen. But with the modern workday sped up to a feverish clip, the only way to get everything done seems to be to do it all at once: read, eat, type, repeat. In the process, though, has multitasking transformed food into something like elevator music—background filler that we take in and tune out? It’s a question that seems particularly ripe at this point in time, when pressures to dine al desko collide with the fetishization of the culinary scene, and when a rise in meditation awareness meets an epidemic of tech-driven distraction. Finding a way to marry those two worlds—using mindfulness to reconnect with the simple pleasures of a meal—seems like a worthwhile pursuit. Lilian Cheung, D.Sc., the director of health promotion and communication in the Department of Nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, certainly thinks so. In 2010, Cheung co-authored the book Savor: Mindful Eating, Mindful Life with the Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh, who first introduced her to the technique two decades ago at a six-day retreat. Trained to investigate the physical effects of food on health and disease, Cheung found mindful eating—engaging in the present moment, dialing into the senses, slowing down—to be a quiet revelation. But even a seemingly cerebral exercise has bodily implications, she points out, particularly when it comes to improved chewing. (The barnyard root of the word ruminate comes to mind.) Not only does it stimulate saliva secretion, releasing a key enzyme that breaks down carbohydates, but smaller food particles are also more easily processed in the GI tract for better nutrient absorption. “There’s interesting research that actually shows that chewing more can lead to higher levels of fullness-inducing hormones,” she adds. Food for thought, at a time when the phrase “mindless obesity” is cropping up in the literature, a nod to the overeating that comes with boredom or graze-under-fire deadlines. But conventional dieting this emphatically is not. “We want to move away from this idea of perfection,” says Marsha Hudnall, president of The Center for Mindful Eating. If prescriptive plans are often threaded with guilt (what is a slip from “clean eating” if not a stain?), here the pursuit is bite-by-bite satisfaction—“and pleasure is good medicine,” she says. Jean Kristeller, Ph.D., an emeritus professor at Indiana State University who developed the Mindfulness-Based Eating Awareness Training Program, agrees. “Our taste buds are very powerful in giving feedback. What is the point of eating something if you’re not even enjoying it anymore?” she asks, a question explored in her 2015 book, The Joy of Half a Cookie . (The second half, saved for later, tastes even better, she adds.) So where to begin? A pre-meal meditation is a good tack. “It’s not necessarily sitting there with your legs crossed and your eyes closed,” Hudnall says, recommending even a one-minute check-in. “It helps you become very aware: ‘What is my hunger level, what do I feel like eating?’” Cheung goes one step further: that is, to a designated mindful-eating corner in the cafeteria, where she and her colleagues retire their devices to the center of the table. “I consider lunchtime as a valuable and indispensable time to refuel, relax, refresh, and nurture myself, so I do mark it in the calendar as an appointment for my own well-being.” It’s also an opportunity to think beyond the self, to “thank nature and also the hard work of mankind—not just the chefs, but farmers, truck drivers, supermarket employees,” she says. “A very important aspect of mindful eating is how our food choices affect the health of our planet.” I reflect back on the almonds—too casually consumed for all the resources it takes to grow them—and find myself humbled, considering the automaton refueling that’s accompanied even this story. But awareness and nonjudgment are important first steps, and besides, Kristeller reminds me, this is well-ingrained behavior: “We make hundreds of decisions a day about eating and food.” Mindfulness is just that: a practice.
