Those with information are to WhatsApp Koh’s son Jonathan at 011-3973-2670.\nSelangor CID chief Senior Asst Comm Fadzil Ahmat confirmed Koh’s abduction on Tuesday.\nLiew, 61, believes the people who abducted her husband were “no ordinary abductors”.\n“The abductors were masked. The abduction was professionally executed and it took less than 60 seconds (as shown by CCTV footage),” she said.\nAccording to witnesses, at least five masked men were involved. \nBased on a police report by Jonathan, Koh left his Petaling Jaya home at about 10am on Monday.\nHe was driving a silver Honda Accord bearing the licence plate number ST 5515 D. \nThe abduction took place in Jalan SS4b/10, Petaling Jaya, less than 100m from the Police Housing Complex.\nAccording to CCTV footage, at least three black SUVs stopped in the middle of the road.\nKoh’s abduction was not properly captured by the camera but the shuffling of feet can be seen, with two SUVs seen moving away, followed by a light-­coloured car believed to be Koh’s. \nThe third SUV was seen trailing them. \nKoh was involved in church charity and community work with a group called Harapan Komuniti, which he founded more than 10 years ago. \nHarapan Komuniti holds tuition classes for children and English lessons for adults. \nIn 2011, Koh’s NGO was accused by the Selangor Islamic Religious Department (Jais) of preaching to Muslims following a raid on a thanksgiving and fund-raising dinner at the Damansara Utama Methodist Church.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T02:23:26.181+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
