(Bill Kostroun/AP)   8:12 AM \nWhat exactly happened on Feb. 12 when Darrelle Revis was involved in a fight with two men, Dallas Cousins, 22, and Zacheriah Jarvis, 21. \nI don’t know. And I really don’t care. \nThat’s not the story. \nRevis could receive up to 65 years in prison — even if he didn’t throw a single punch. \nJets doing their homework on how to recoup $6M if they cut Revis \nThat’s the real story. \nThat should have been the story even before a new TMZ video emerged suggesting that another person threw the punches. \nThe story is not about Revis’ role that night. \nThe story is about the astonishing abusive power of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. \nVideo emerges of aftermath of Darrelle Revis altercation \nThe story is its capacity to turn a physical altercation into combined charges that resemble a homicide. \nThe story is that this sort of manipulative malpractice by police sends thousands of (mostly black) people to prison who lack Revis’ fame and resources to fight back. \nThat’s the story. \nHow could Revis possibly receive such a draconian sentence? According to Sports Illustrated’s legal analyst Michael McCann, under Pennsylvania law, here is how: \n• Up to 20 years: First degree aggravated assault on first person punched \n• Up to 20 years: Same for second person punched \n• Up to 20 years: First degree felony robbery \n• Up to 5 years: Making “terroristic threats” \nThe possibility of 65 years in prison (though with no record he’s not likely to get anything close to that) is the real “terroristic threat.” \nBut what if Revis never even threw a punch? \nThat may not matter. The Pittsburgh Police also threw a “criminal conspiracy” charge at Revis. \nNeither Cousins, Jarvis nor witness Nathan Watt could confirm if Revis threw any punches. If another person defending Revis threw the punches as the video suggests, Revis could still possibly face the very same criminal penalty as if he threw punches himself, according to McCann. \nDoes facing up to 20 years for another man’s punches sound right to you? Me neither. \nAccording to the cell video cited in the complaint, Revis was walking away from the group, Cousins followed him, and then Revis stated \"why are you following me?\" several times. A conspiracy conviction would mean Revis and the associate “agreed and conspired” to assault Cousins and Jarvis. \nGiven that Revis was followed at first, does a conspiracy charge sound right to you? \nIn a statement released to USA TODAY Sports and other media outlets, hours after the TMZ video surfaced, Revis’s attorneys Robert G. Del Greco Jr. and Mark Fiorilli made Revis’ position clear: \n\"Darrelle Revis absolutely, categorically and positively did not knock out anyone, did not conspire with anyone to commit an assault, did not say 'shut up before I knock your ass out next,' and surely did not 'rob' another of a cell phone. The voice and admissions made on the video are not that of Darrelle Revis. We have no doubt but that further investigation relative to the clothing and voice verification will corroborate the above assertions.\" \nAgain, it may not matter one bit if it is proven Revis never threw a punch, if the Pittsburg police can prove the “criminal conspiracy\" charge. \nLet’s put this charge in police perspective for a second: \nIn the spur of the moment, Revis had enough time to hatch up a conspiracy with another man, but the six Baltimore Police officers who killed Freddie Gray in the back of a van were tried as separate individuals? \n(In fact, one of the biggest problems in Gray’s case is the actual conspiracy of silence of Baltimore cops made it nearly impossible to prove which cop’s actions resulted in Freddie’s severed spine.) \nThe conspiracy charge on Revis was just the worst of many. \nThen there is the “robbery” charge. \nAccording to the police report, as Revis walked away, Cousins began recording video on his cell phone, and Revis responded by snatching Cousins' cell phone in an attempt to delete the video and eventually threw it into the street. \nEven if true, does taking a cell phone and tossing it sound like a “robbery” to you? Does having such an act punishable up to 20 years sound right to you? \nAnd then there is the “terroristic threat” charge. \nWhile it is not the same as a “terrorist” threat, it is well-known in Pennsylvania as “a threat to harm another person with the goal of terrorizing that individual.\" Darrelle Revis enters Municipal Court in Pittsburgh on Friday, Feb. 17. (Jared Wickerham/for New York Daily News) \nWhile the charges have not yet been explained by law enforcement, it is possible the “terroristic threat” is based on Watt’s claim that a clench-fisted Revis said to him, “I got more guys coming. ... Do you want to be next?” \nIf so, that statement is punishable up to five years. Does that sound right to you? \nMany Pennsylvania lawyers also advocate changing the name of the “terroristic threat” charge. The label often discriminates against people of color in other states in a country where we refuse to label actual homegrown terrorism by whites. \nNow put it all together. \nFour felonies. Conspiracy, robbery and terroristic threat. And 65 possible years of prison time. \nI’m not asking the legal analyst in you if this is just. I’m asking the human being in you. \nIf so, the only “criminal conspiracy” is being issued by the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. \nLet’s be clear: Revis is the victim here. The final facts that emerge will only determine to what degree. \nHe is the victim of a ruthless Pittsburgh police force. \nThe reason we have heard so little about it is because the police practice of issuing excessive charges has become so thoroughly normalized as to not be questioned at all. \nSo instead of rightfully condemning this form of police violence, we condemn Revis for being involved in the type of behavior that can be routinely found in the drunken stands of any given Jets game. \nImagine if every Jets fan went to prison who had a friend or associate nearby punch someone out? \nThat’s a lot of fans. \nThe answers on Revis will come soon enough, but these critical questions must start now while Revis is being media-dragged through the mud instead of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. \nIf anything, the media spotlight should have already been on the Pittsburgh Police after the November resignation of Pittsburgh Police Chief Cameron McLay. \nIf that name sounds familiar, it is because Chief McClay gained national notoriety in January of 2015 when he posed for a picture with a sign that read: “I resolve to challenge racism @ work. #EndWhiteSilence.\" \nThat day, McClay encountered a group of activists at a parade and spoke with them, in McClay’s words, “about how implicit, or unconscious bias results in misunderstanding on all sides, and how the need is for dialogue to clear up misunderstanding.\" McLay agreed to hold their sign. \nWow. Maybe police reform does have hope? \nNo ethical human being should have had a problem with that sign, but local police union president Howard McQuillan did. He told told KDKA: “The chief is calling us racists. He believes the Pittsburgh Police Department is racist. This has angered a lot of officers.” \nAt minimum, McQuillan’s response reveals his astonishing ignorance and embarrassing command of the English language. More tangibly, it shows that the Pittsburgh Police Union has absolutely no desire to improve itself and remotely challenge racial bias within its own ranks. \nAt the time, McClay responded: \n“I was hired to restore the legitimacy of the police department. I did not seek these young activists out. I was stopping for coffee at First Night. Their message is not anti-anybody. It is simply a call for awareness. The photo was a great, spontaneous moment in time. Please join dialogue for community healing.” \nSince then, McClay has been basically forced to resign. The police union held a no-confidence vote in September and the Citizens Police Review Board has since determined McLay violated a city code banning partisan political activity by speaking at a political convention in uniform. \nMcClay spoke at the Democratic National Convention but did not endorse Hillary Clinton and had nothing particularly controversial to say (Unlike still-employed Milwaukee Police Chief Sheriff David Clarke who spoke at the RNC, did endorse Trump and made more explosive statements in a career filled with unconscionable ones). \nMcClay’s \"resignation” and brief two-year stint as a reformer is the context that must be present when viewing Pittsburgh Police. \nIf the Chief of Police can’t fundamentally change the racial culture of the Pittsburgh police, why on earth should we be surprised at the charges issued to Revis? \nIf these are the charges against a well-known celebrity like Revis, what do you think is happening to less wealthy young black men and women in Pittsburgh? \nJust how many thousands of people are in jail because they couldn’t risk fighting in courts so they took a plea to avoid decades in prison? \nThese are the questions we need to be asking — not why Revis was awake past his normal bed time. \nSuch ruthless police charges and plea bargains have ruined countless lives, specifically the lives of people who look like Revis. \nBecause of the bogus charges and Revis’ resources, he will likely never see a jail cell. \nRevis will be back in court this Thursday, and still could face up to 65 years in prison — even if he didn’t throw a punch. \nThis Thursday, the “criminal conspiracy” and “terroristic threats” of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is what ought to be on trial.
