He's already anchored huge studio tentpoles in Star Trek Into Darkness and Doctor Strange , and it seems written on the wall he will one day be receiving an \"about time\" Oscar. EDITOR’S PICK Jimmy Fallon Took Benedict Cumberbatch to \"Mad Lib Theater\" to Prepare Him for SNL \nUntil then, Cumberbatch looks to be taking the scenic route. Coming off Doctor Strange , arguably his most high-profile role to date, his next project is going to be a lot more intimate and personal. Variety has word Benedict Cumberbatch will be producing and starring in an adaptation of A Child In Time , a much-loved Ian McEwan novel. Per reports: \n\"Cumberbatch will play children’s author Stephen Lewis, who must cope with the sudden loss of his daughter, Kate. Kate’s absence sets Stephen and his wife on diverging paths as both struggle with an all-consuming grief. With the passage of time, a balance of sorts returns, until hope surfaces and triumphs unexpectedly.\" \nSounds... good, I guess? This is clearly a project and a story he wants to tell, and people sure go nuts for 90-minute, very sad BBC dramas. This is the kind of thing that really cleans up during the first hour of the Golden Globes, which I promise is not a burn. There are no costars attached just yet, but the whole thing is a co-production between BBC One and Masterpiece, meaning it'll be full of accents and ANGUISH. \nThere's no word on when A Child in Time will air just yet, so go ahead and tell your mom to just simmer down for now.
