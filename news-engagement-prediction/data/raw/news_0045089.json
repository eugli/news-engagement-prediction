Wilmette Junior High School seventh grader and protest organizer Nicholas Wilson talks with rally attendees during a Feb. 18 rally at Wilmette Village Hall, to protest the confirmation of Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. (Eric P. Davis / Pioneer Press) Kathy Routliffe Junior High School students who gathered Saturday in front of Wilmette Village Hall was small, but their chants against President Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos , his new education secretary, were loud and enthusiastic.\n\"Down with DeVos!\" \n\"No Trump!\" \nLeading the group of almost a dozen seventh and eighth grade students on a brief march around the village hall was Wilmette resident Nicholas Wilson, a seventh grader who had planned the rally and march. \n\"I'm anti-Trump. When he won, I freaked out,\" Nicholas said before the march. \"I felt that the teen community needed to talk about it.\" \nSitting to one side, making it clear that she was only an observer, albeit a proud one, mom Amy Wilson watched the proceedings. \n\"Since he was able to talk, he's always felt as if he's been 40,\" she said of her son. \"He's so wise â€“ he's an old soul. And he has what I like to call a human rights gene.\" \nNicholas started an Instagram account under the name Teen Protest Union, at https://www.instagram.com/tpu_riseup/?hl=en and slowly gathered followers. When the U.S. Senate narrowly confirmed DeVos as the country's education secretary, Nicholas decided it was time for the little community to show its opposition. \nBy that time, Wilmette Junior High eighth grade student Jonathan Schayngesicht, who knows Nicholas through a band they're both in, had come on board to manage the Instagram account. \nJonathan's twin sister Grace, who had attended the Women's March on Chicago last month, was at the Feb. 18 Village Hall event as well: \"I know we had supported resistance that day. We need to do more, and so I came today.\" \nPam Levitt, Jonathan's and Grace's mother, sat with Amy Wilson and watched the students. \n\"To me, it's important that John's involved. The fact that he recognizes that kids will be hurt by what's going on, by this new education secretary, is important,\" Levitt said. \nThe marchers weren't without opponents. Three eighth graders with a bullhorn came to voice support for the new president's administration. \nNone of the trio appeared to bear any animus toward their philosophical opposites, even chatting briefly with them before occasionally using the bullhorn to announce their views. \nAfter roughly 40 minutes, the Trump-DeVos opponents disbanded, but Nicholas said he was happy with the event and hoped the rally shows adults that teens are paying attention, and are plugged in to their country's political issues. \n\"I was very concerned last night, but it's a good turnout,\" he said. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T04:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:34:17.728+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
