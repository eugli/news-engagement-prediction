Like ever. Should come as no surprise that they were awesome. Was great to be a metalhead again for one night!\" \nAhead of the final performance Osbourne said his emotions were \"all over the place\". \nRehearsing for the big finale, he told the BBC: \"Since I've got to this building, I've been happy, I've been tearful. Let's see what happens.\" \nCredited with creating the heavy metal genre in the depths of 1960s industrial Birmingham, the band went on to release 19 studio albums and 31 singles. \n\"One of the proudest things I have in my heart is the fact that Black Sabbath wasn't a band that was created by some big mogul,\" Osbourne said. \n\"It was four guys who said, 'Let's have a dream', and it came true beyond our wildest expectations.\" \nHe described his life with the band as \"the most incredible adventure\", but conceded that Sabbath had \"run its course\". \nFans need not be completely disheartened by the end of Black Sabbath, however, as Osbourne will continue to perform as a solo artist.
