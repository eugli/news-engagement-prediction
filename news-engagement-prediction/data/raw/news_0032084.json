Nikita Wadhawan | Posted by Neha Vashishth A + A - Photo: Twitter/@whymeumesh \nArvind Kejriwal has remained busy with Punjab and Goa elections of late, but his government in the national capital is completing 2 years on February 14. And in these two years of AAP government, which the party won 67 out of 70 seats in the 2015 Assembly whitewash, 110 mohalla clinics have treated over 8 lakh patients as per the government data. \nWorld leaders like former UN secretary general Kofi Annan and former World Health Organisation director general Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland have praised the project for aiming to provide free public health care but India Today gathered that the ground reality was far away from the objectives to set up mohalla clinics. \nWhile people have flocked to the mohalla clinics to avail free check ups and medication, the clinics still have a long way to go when it comes to effectiveness. The doctors working with the project have also pointed to inconsistencies. \nLIMITED RANGE OF TESTS \n\"The clinics should be able to provide 212 tests free of cost but till now only a limited amount of test are provided,\" says Dr Alka at Peeragarhi clinic in West Delhi. In the absence of this facility the doctors are forced to refer the patient to hospitals. \nUPAID DOCTORS \nAlthough, the clinic are free for the patients, the doctors don't work free of cost and this seems to elude the AAP government as the doctors are still waiting for their dues. \"We are still awaiting this month's payment,\" says Dr V S Chauhan, chief medical office of Jangpura mohalla clinic. \nWhen it comes to payment, many doctors are also demanding equal work and equal pay. The doctors at these clinics are paid just Rs 30 per patients and work on commission whereas doctors in the hospitals earn more than Rs 50,000 per month. \nBJP leader Vijendra Gupta says: \"that the mohalla clinics are a scam to fool the people of Delhi and are just Kejriwal's political agenda\" The government had planned to set up 1,000 mohalla clinics for consultation, medicines and tests free of cost by the end of 2016. \nThis deadline has been extended to March 2017 but it is unlikely that the government will be able to meet it. With, only around 110 mohalla clinics functional, the AAP government has sought to take refuge in its tussle with the lieutenant governor and Centre. \nLIMITED TIMINGS \nAnother major drawback of the mohalla clinics is that they are open only between 9am to 1pm and most remain closed on Sunday creating problems for people with medical emergencies. \"The timing is such that we need to either take off from schools or take a half day from office,\" says a patient at clinic. \nSince there are only 110 clinics till now the impact is still not felt. The AAP government may have showcased this as a path breaking achievement and received international acclaim. But the project is still in its preliminary stages and is far from being a game changer for health sector.
