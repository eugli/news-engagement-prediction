President Salva Kiir's remarks to the transitional national assembly came after famine was declared in parts of oil-rich Unity state. More than 100,000 people are affected, according to South Sudan's government and U.N. agencies. They say another 1 million people are on the brink of starvation.

Some in Kiir's government have expressed hostility toward the international community, accusing it of meddling in the country's affairs. Human Rights Watch researcher Jonathan Pedneault wrote Tuesday that the famine is a man-made result of “conflict, warring parties blocking access for aid workers and large-scale human rights violations.” Also Tuesday, the European Commission announced an $87 million emergency aid package for South Sudan, saying this is the first famine declared in the country since it gained independence from Sudan in 2011.

Crucially what matters is that all parties allow humanitarian organizations to have immediate and full access to do their job and deliver aid.” Tens of thousands have died in the civil war that began in December 2013 and has continued despite a peace agreement in 2015. More than 1.5 million people have fled the country. South Sudan also is experiencing severe inflation, which has made food unaffordable for many families.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:18:17.184+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
