It’s when the people in a community want to absolve themselves of guilt, so they get a goat and heap all of the ills on the goat, and then they run the goat out of town. The inference to be drawn from his statement is that other people have blame that should be shared in all of this. The good news is that General Flynn is gone.” \nA reporter captured the hilarious moment an aide explained to Pelosi that the tweet was not actually from Flynn : Aide tells Pelosi the \"scapegoat\" Flynn tweet was fake, \"what do you mean it's fake?\" She says. pic.twitter.com/tLNQswqfpb \n— Ema O'Connor (@o_ema) February 14, 2017 \nAnd Pelosi wasn’t the only Democrat fooled. Rep. Elijah Cummings, the ranking House Oversight member — Congress’ chief investigating committee, didn’t do much investigating himself before following Pelosi to blast Flynn for the fake tweets: The tweet Cummings is citing here did not come from Flynn pic.twitter.com/11X88tukaA \n— Colin Jones (@colinjones) February 14, 2017 \nPelosi once again made Democrats look completely foolish — the latest example of her bizarre gaffes. \nOne included her saying if any Americans “ breathe air or drink water ”, Trump’s pick for Supreme Court — Neil Gorsuch — would harm them. \nPelosi has also referred to Trump as “ President Bush .” \nWith an opponent like Pelosi repeatedly making herself the unfortunate headline, Trump is going to have an easy 4 years with Congressional Democrats.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T10:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T05:29:44.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
