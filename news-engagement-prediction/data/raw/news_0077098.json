Neither did the provincial government.\nDelay and speculation  \nHour after hour passed without any official update. Albertans went to bed and woke up the following morning to learn the emergency was ongoing.\nAt 8:44 a.m., the province announced the alert had ended. But there was still no word on what it was.\nIt wasn't until 12:46 p.m. that RCMP revealed the incident was related to an armed standoff with police.\nIn the meantime, speculation had run wild on social media with all sorts of theories — some suggesting it was a traffic accident, others guessing it was an escaped convict.\nMore than one person interpreted a terse RCMP quote about the \"fluid situation\" to mean some type of chemical or other hazardous liquid had spilled.\nAfter the story was picked up by an online conspiracy-theory aggregator, some even half-joked about an alien invasion, noting the nearby Town of St. Paul is home to Canada's first UFO landing pad  (a gimmick built in 1967 as part of the country's centennial celebrations.)\nThe Twitter account @Conspiracylizer, which aggregates online stories about conspiracy theories, picked up on the \"civil emergency\" in St. Paul, Alta. (@Conspiracylizer/Twitter)\nBut the lack of timely information is no laughing matter, according to Democracy Watch co-founder Duff Conacher.\n\"The public has a right to know those things as early as possible so that they can decide how they want to act as a result,\" he said, noting a chemical spill could be a real concern for many people.\n\"What if you have a family member in that area who calls you and says, 'I'm really sick and I think I'm dying?' You kind of want to know what's going on.\"\n\n\n\n\nDavid Fraser, a Halifax-based privacy lawyer, said it's rare for police in other jurisdictions to withhold basic facts about the nature of an emergency situation — especially after something as potentially alarming as a \"civil emergency\" is declared.\nPrivacy lawyer David Fraser says police typically reveal basic details about the nature of a public emergency relatively quickly and was surprised by how long it took RCMP in several Alberta incidents. (CBC)\n\"A declaration like this is extraordinary,\" he said.\n\"I would think that declaration should include much more than just the fact that there is a declaration and to stay out of a particular area.\"\nRCMP Sgt. Jack Poitras said it's not clear why the emergency alert was sent out in this particular case — as opposed to the more common method of a police press release — and admitted to \"hiccups\" in the communication process that led to the 16-hour delay.\nBut it's not the first time this month Albertans have been left in the dark on details after initially being warned about an emergency situation.\nPincher Creek cases At 7:39 p.m. on Saturday night, RCMP issued a press release about an \"unfolding situation\" in Pincher Creek, about 200 kilometres south of Calgary.\nThe release said police had set up a containment area and asked the public to stay away and refrain from posting photos of the incident on social media.\nThe wording was reminiscent of a similar release RCMP had issued early in the morning of Feb. 8, which began in a similar, vague way and turned out to be a serious situation.\nPolice revealed by midday they were dealing with a suspect who had allegedly fired a gun at officers.\nThe details of Saturday's incident weren't made public until Monday, however.\nMore than 40 hours after the initial press release, RCMP issued an update saying the incident — also involving an armed and barricaded man — had ended with the man's death, which was deemed to be non-suspicious.\nThis is typically how police refer indirectly to a suicide, which is a sensitive topic and one not usually reported in the news media unless there is a public interest.\nPublic safety and public anxiety Sean Holman, a journalism professor at Calgary's Mount Royal University, said there is generally a public interest in knowing at least the basic details of what happened when armed police secure and area and order people to keep out.\nIn the absence of official information, he said speculation can flourish, and that can lead to public safety concerns of its own.\n\"Part of public safety involves guarding against public anxiety,\" he said. \"Because when there is anxiety, when there is uncertainty, the public's actions become unpredictable.\"\nHolman, who focuses much of his work on freedom of information and government accountability, said things that are routinely disclosed in a timely way in other parts of Canada are often treated differently in Alberta.\n\"Alberta is and has long been one of the most secretive jurisdictions in the country,\" he said.\n\"We seem to often have public agencies with attitudes that they know best when it comes to the information that they provide to the public, rather than thinking that the public has a right to this information.\"\nSgt. Poitras said there are sometimes logistical challenges with gathering and disseminating information during emergency responses in rural areas in particular, but the RCMP do take it seriously.\n\"We're certainly trying to improve in those areas and make sure you get the news in a timely fashion,\" he said.\n\n\nWhat is a 'civil emergency' anyway? During the ongoing \"civil emergency\" on Sunday evening and Monday morning, questions abounded on social media as to exactly what that means.\nThey were met with a terse reply.\nIt's an incident that \"disrupts normal civilian activities,\" according to @511Alberta, the province's Twitter account that normally deals with highway conditions.\nThat's also the definition listed on the Alberta Emergency Alert website, which offers no further detail.\n\n\nCBC News asked on Monday for more information from Alberta Municipal Affairs, the provincial department responsible for the emergency alerts, but received no answer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T01:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T16:23:07.885+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
