Several others were trapped on their balconies until firefighters arrived to battle the three-alarm blaze. \n“When we arrived, there was flames coming out of the apartment balcony and heavy black smoke,” Toronto Fire Division Cmdr. Dan MacIsaac said. \nMore than 60 firefighters worked to get the fire under control. Three floors of the Toronto Community Housing complex had to be evacuated. \nOn Monday morning, Toronto Mayor John Tory stopped by to speak with residents who were being sheltered in a transit bus. Tory praised Meawasige for his heroic efforts. \n“I just think it’s extraordinary that a citizen like him, who says he has been a volunteer firefighter elsewhere, responds in that way that you’d like to think that we all would,” Tory told reporters at the scene. \nMost of the damage was contained to the one unit, thanks to the quick work of firefighters. \nThe cause of the fire is still under investigation. \nWith a report from CTV Toronto's Scott Lightfoot Photos Firefighters tackle a three-alarm fire in a downtown Toronto apartment building on Monday, Feb. 20, 2017.
