ET 0Shares With the Daytona 500 just around the corner — the race is set for Feb.26 at 2 p.m. ET on FOX — it’s a good time to look at the 40 greatest Daytona 500 performers of all time. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 40 Ricky Rudd The main claim to fame for Rudd in the Daytona 500 is that his 29 starts in the Great American Race tie him for second all-time with Terry Labonte. Rudd earned four top-five and 10 top-10 finishes in the 500, and in 1984, he raced in the 500 with his eyes literally duct-taped open after a horrible crash in the Busch Clash. RacingOne 39 Pete Hamilton The New England driver with the good looks of a Southern California surfer, Hamilton famously won the 1970 Daytona 500 in the winged blue No. 40 Petty Enterprises Plymouth Superbird, with Richard’s brother Maurice as his crew chief. Hamilton also swept both Talladega races that year. ISC Archives via Getty Images RacingOne 38 Jamie McMurray One of the best restrictor-plate racers of the contemporary era, McMurray won the 2010 Daytona 500 in his first race back with Earnhardt Ganassi Racing with Felix Sabates. It was McMurray’s only top-10 finish in the 500, though he has also won the Coke Zero 400. © F. Peirce Williams F.Peirce Williams 37 Ward Burton In what at the time was something of an upset, Burton won the 2002 Daytona 500 driving a Bill Davis Racing Dodge with Tommy Baldwin as his crew chief. For his career, Burton made 10 Daytona 500 starts, with three top-10 finishes and an average finish of 19.7. WireImage Kevin Kane 36 Ned Jarrett Gentleman Ned, as Jarrett was known, never won the Daytona 500, but the two-time NASCAR champion had two top-five and six top-10 finishes in seven starts in the race. His finishing average was 9.1, impressive given the era he raced in saw a lot of engine failures. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 35 Junior Johnson NASCAR Hall of Fame driver Junior Johnson is credited with discovering the draft at the fabled 2.5-mile superspeedway, which he used to great advantage to win the second Daytona 500 in 1960. In seven starts in the Great American race, Johnson had one victory, one top-five and one top-10 finish. 34 Ryan Newman Hard to believe, but when Newman won the 2008 Daytona 500, it was the first NASCAR restrictor-plate race victory for Team Penske, dating back to 1972. 33 Tiny Lund A gentle giant, Lund pulled Marvin Panch from a burning sports car at Daytona in 1963, saving his life in the process. The injured Panch convinced the Wood Brothers to let Lund drive their car in the 1963 Daytona 500, which Lund won on a single set of tires. 32 Marvin Panch One Daytona 500 victory, two top-five and three top-10 finishes in seven starts for Panch, who was named one of NASCAR’s 50 greatest drivers. Panch, a native of Wisconsin, won the third Daytona 500 in 1961, driving a Smokey Yunick-prepared 1960 Pontiac. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 31 LeeRoy Yarbrough The 1969 Daytona 500 winner, Yarbrough had two top-five and four top-10 finishes in seven starts in the Great American Race. In the ’69 race, Yarbrough came from 11 seconds back with 10 laps to go, as he ran down Charlie Glotzbach for the victory. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 30 Joe Weatherly A two-time NASCAR Sprint Cup champion who was killed in the prime of his career in 1964, Weatherly posted three top-five and four top-10 finishes in just five Daytona 500 starts. Weatherly, known as the clown prince of NASCAR, Weatherly had a great average finish of 11.8 in the 500. 29 Kurt Busch Although he’s yet to win a Daytona 500, Busch has been sensational here: three Daytona 500 runner-up finishes and 11 top fives in 31 starts. In 2011, Busch won the Advance Auto Parts Clash and his Can-Am Duel qualifying race before finishing fifth in the Daytona 500.

He also scored three consecutive polls in NASCAR’s biggest race. Tragically, Roberts succumbed to injuries following a crash in the 1964 Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 27 Ernie Irvan Called “Swervin’ Irvan” early in his career, Irvan developed into one of the most feared restrictor-plate racers of the early 1990s. He drove the Kodak-sponsored Morgan-McClure Chevrolet to victory in the 1991 Daytona 500 and won the Coke Zero 400 the following year in the same car. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 26 Geoff Bodine By winning the 1986 Daytona 500, Bodine put the fledgling Hendrick Motorsports team on the NASCAR map in a big way. In 21 Daytona 500 starts, the New York native posted five top-five and eight top-10 finishes, along with an average finish of 18.6. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 25 Mario Andretti The only driver to win the Daytona 500, Indianapolis 500 and a Formula One world driving championship, the diminutive Italian native stunned the NASCAR community by winning the 1967 500 in a Holman-Moody Ford Fairlane. It was one of just three Daytona 500 starts for Andretti. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 24 Lee Petty The patriarch of the Petty clan won the inaugural Daytona 500 in 1959, in a photo finish that wasn’t decided until the Wednesday after the race. Petty only made one more start in the Daytona 500, as his driving career ended with a near-fatal crash in a Daytona qualifying race in 1961. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 23 Donnie Allison One of the toughest drivers of all time and a charter member of the Alabama Gang, Allison posted two poles and two top-fives in 13 Daytona 500s. But his real claim to fame was the 1979 last-lap crash and subsequent fight with Cale Yarborough as the two were racing for the victory. That fight drew national attention and helped put NASCAR on the map. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 22 Denny Hamlin Last year, Hamlin won his first Daytona 500 after finishing fourth in 2015 and second in 2014. Hamlin also won the Advance Auto Parts Clash as a rookie in 2006 and then again in 2014 and ’16. He also has won his Can-Am Duel qualifying race twice. USA TODAY Sports Jasen Vinlove 21 Benny Parsons Driving for North Carolina trucking company owner L.G. DeWitt, Parsons won the 1975 Daytona 500. More impressively, perhaps, he scored top-five finishes in eight of 20 starts in NASCAR’s biggest race. He also posted one pole and nine top 10s, and an average finish of 17, which is excellent for a plate track. Parsons went on to become a favorite announcer after retiring. ISC Archives via Getty Images RacingOne 20 Jimmie Johnson In 2006, Johnson won his first Daytona 500 and did so after crew chief Chad Knaus was suspended because the No. 48 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet flunked post-qualifying inspection. Johnson won the 500 for a second time in 2013. Brian Czobat / autostock © 271 Fryling Ave SW Concord, NC 28025 W 704.786.2919 C 704.904.2745 autostock/Brian Czobat 19 Matt Kenseth The 2003 NASCAR Premier Series champion won the 2009 Daytona 500 when he passed Elliott Sadler just moments before heavy rain fell, forcing a premature end to the race. Kenseth won the Great American Race for a second time in 2012 and was in the lead on the final lap last year. 18 Davey Allison The son of Bobby and nephew of Donnie Allison, Davey Allison was a tremendous restrictor-plate racer, winning the 1992 Daytona 500 and finishing second to his father in 1988. Davey surely would have posted bigger numbers, but he made just seven Daytona 500 starts before perishing in a helicopter crash at Talladega in 1993. ISC Archives via Getty Images RacingOne 17 Darrell Waltrip One of the most famous victories of all-time came for D.W. in 1989, when he ended 17 years of frustration by nursing home his Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet to victory with just enough fuel in the tank to win. In Victory Lane, Waltrip performed the “Ickey Shuffle,” a dance named after Cincinnati Bengals running back Ickey Woods. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 16 Michael Waltrip The younger Waltrip was winless in his first 462 NASCAR Sprint Cup starts, breaking that streak with a stunning upset victory in the 2001 Daytona 500. But just as Waltrip was crossing the finish line, his car owner and close friend Dale Earnhardt was killed in a crash in Turn 4. Two years later, Waltrip won again in a rain-shortened Daytona 500. ISC Archives via Getty Images RacingOne 15 Fred Lorenzen Known as “The Golden Boy,” Lorenzen’s main claim to fame was that in 1963 he became the first driver in NASCAR history to win $100,000 in a single season. Lorenzen won the 1965 Daytona 500 and his stats in this race truly are impressive: Seven top-five and eight top-10 finishes in just nine starts. His average finish of 6.9 is the best of any driver with at least five Daytona 500 starts. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 14 Sterling Marlin The Tennessee native is the last driver to score victories in back-to-back Daytona 500s, winning in 1994 and ‘95 behind the wheel of the Morgan-McClure Chevrolet. Marlin nearly won again in 2002, but during a late-race red flag, jumped out of his car to pull a fender away from a wheel, which was against the rules. Still, he was one of the best restrictor-plate racers of his generation. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 13 Tony Stewart Despite never winning the Daytona 500, the three-time champion has a tremendous record here, scoring 17 race victories at this track, including three Coke Zero 400s, three Advance Auto Parts Clash races and seven NASCAR XFINITY Series races. Stewart ranks second all-time in Daytona race victories behind only the late Dale Earnhardt. Getty Images Getty Images 12 Kevin Harvick Harvick rocked the NASCAR world in 2007, when he made a stunning last-lap charge to victory past Mark Martin as half the field crashed behind them. Harvick has won the Advance Auto Parts Clash three times, in 2009-10 and ’13. Getty Images Getty Images for NASCAR 11 A.J. Foyt The most versatile driver of his generation, the hard-nosed Texan won the 24 Hours of Le Mans, four Indianapolis 500s and the 1972 Daytona 500. Foyt’s only Daytona 500 came by a margin of nearly two laps, and the ’72 race saw just three race leaders — Foyt, Richard Petty and Bobby Allison — the fewest ever in the Daytona 500. This content is subject to copyright. The Enthusiast Network 10 David Pearson At or near the top of the list for best Daytona 500s ever was the 1976 race, when David Pearson and Richard Petty crashed on the last lap, with Pearson’s heavily damaged Wood Brothers Mercury limping to the finish line to win. Surprisingly, perhaps, that was Pearson’s only Daytona 500 victory, although he did post six top-five finishes. 9 Dale Earnhardt Jr. Like his late father, Earnhardt excels at restrictor-plate racing, winning the Daytona 500 in 2004 and 2014 as well as the Coke Zero 400 in 2001 and ‘15. A perennial fan favorite, Earnhardt Jr. has 13 top-five and 19 top-10 finishes in 34 points races at Daytona. He also is a two-time winner of the Advance Auto Parts Clash. 8 Dale Jarrett One of the most famous Daytona 500 finishes of all time came in 1993, when Jarrett won the first of his three 500s by holding off Dale Earnhardt as father Ned Jarrett called the race on live television. The “Dale and Dale show” made for high drama and gave Joe Gibbs Racing its first — and so far, only — 500 victory. Bob Harmeyer Getty Images 7 Bill Elliott A two-time Daytona 500 winner, Elliott was victorious here in 1985 and ’87. “Awesome Bill from Dawsonville” was always at his best at fast tracks, as witnessed by his four poles, nine top fives and 14 top 10s in the 500. In 1987, Elliott set the track qualifying record at Daytona, with a lap of 210.364 miles per hour. Focus on Sport Focus on Sport/Getty Images 6 Buddy Baker The late, great Elzie Wylie Baker Jr., better known to all as just plain Buddy, was flat-out fast any time he ran on a restrictor-plate track. Recognized as one of NASCAR’s top 50 drivers of all-time, Baker won the 1980 Daytona 500 at an average speed of 177.602 miles per hour, a record that still stands as the fastest Daytona 500 in history. Baker also was the first driver to break the 200 mph barrier on a closed course. Getty Images Robert Alexander 5 Bobby Allison Another old-school, bare-knuckled racer, Bobby Allison won three Daytona 500s — 1978, ’82 and ’88. The last one was the most poignant, as Allison took the checkered flag with son Davey in second place. Bobby’s driving career would end later that year after a near-fatal crash at Pocono Raceway. To this day, Bobby has no memory of the 1-2 finish with his late son in the ’88 500. Focus on Sport Focus on Sport/Getty Images 4 Dale Earnhardt That Dale Earnhardt was the only driver to win just one Daytona 500, yet crack the top five speaks volumes about “The Intimidator’s” body of work on NASCAR’s biggest stage. Earnhardt had a whole series of near-misses — most notably a flat tire on the final lap in 1990 — before sealing the deal with a hugely emotional victory in 1998. ISC Archives via Getty Images RacingOne 3 Jeff Gordon Here’s where the debate gets complicated: Should Jeff Gordon’s three Daytona 500 victories be ranked ahead of Dale Earnhardt, who only one once but was consistently the man to beat? Gordon’s victories in 1995, ’97 and 2005 ultimately carried the day, but by the narrowest of margins. This content is subject to copyright. Sporting News via Getty Images 2 Cale Yarborough In his day, no one approached Cale Yarborough for toughness. The gritty South Carolina racer won his first 500 driving for the Wood Brothers in 1968 and then won for car owner Junior Johnson in 1977. He scored back-to-back victories for Harry Ranier in 1983 and ’84, making him one of only three drivers to win consecutive Daytona 500s. And the race he didn’t win in 1979, when he and Bobby Allison brawled on national television, is the stuff of legends. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 1 Richard Petty Frankly, the top selection among our 40 drivers was also probably the easiest. Richard Petty, a/k/a “The King,” won seven Daytona 500s, a gold standard no one else even approached. Petty was a central player in two of the most famous 500s ever: In 1976, he and David Pearson crashed on the last lap, with Pearson winning, and three years later, Petty won when Cale Yarborough and Donnie Allison wrecked each other on the last lap going for the victory. In his career at Daytona, Petty had 28 top-five and 37 top-10 finishes, both records.
