Critics said the order in some cases was not clearly communicated to the agencies responsible for implementing it.\nOne of the first people detained at JFK, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, who worked as a US military interpreter for ten years, was finally released after protests and interference by two New York representatives, Jerrold Nader and Nydia Velasquez\nPeople participate in a protest against President Donald Trump's travel ban at Columbia University in New York City on Monday\nProtesters hold signs against President Donald Trump's travel ban in Tompkins Square Park in New York City on Monday\nIt was not known if additional waivers would be granted, the official said. The document did not give the nationalities of the refugees who will be admitted into the United States.\nOver the weekend, non-refugee visitors from seven majority-Muslim countries also targeted in Trump's executive order were detained, deported and in some cases blocked from boarding flights to the United States.\nThe countries covered by the traveler ban were Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Libya and Yemen.\nThe internal DHS document said that between late Friday and early Monday 348 visa holders were prevented from boarding US-bound flights. In addition, more than 200 people landed in the United States but were denied entry, the document showed.\nDemonstrators gather in Whitehall, London to protest about US President Trump's travel ban\nMore than 735 people were pulled aside for questioning by US Customs and Border Protection officers in airports, including 394 legal permanent US residents holding green cards, over the same time period.\nTrump said the executive order he signed on Friday was designed to protect the United States 'from foreign terrorist entry.'\nThe order stopped all refugee admissions for 120 days while government officials determine how to ensure that any refugees admitted do not pose a threat.\nA protester's sign says to Love Thy Neighbor in front of the Supreme Court on Monday\nPeople participate in a candlelight vigil in Dallas on Monday to protest Trump's ban\nThe 872 refugees to be admitted this week, under the waivers, were screened using Obama administration procedures, which typically take two years and include several interviews and a background check.\nThe DHS said on Sunday night that green card holders would be allowed to board US-bound flights, but would be subjected to additional scrutiny upon arrival.\nThe public guidance from DHS also said some people from the seven majority-Muslim countries could be allowed entry to the United States on a case-by-case basis.\nAttendees overflowed a Seattle City Council meeting that reaffirmed that Seattle is a city that treats everyone equally regardless of their refugee or immigrant status\nCongressional Democrats and some foreign countries, including key US allies, put pressure on Trump on Monday over the executive order.\nDemocratic Senators tried to force a vote on a bill to rescind the order, but were blocked by a Republican lawmaker.\nPeople protest Trump's travel ban outside of City Hall in Cincinnati on Monday\nDemocratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said she had 27 co-sponsors for the legislation. But under Senate rules it takes only one member to prevent a vote, and Republican Senator Tom Cotton blocked consideration of the measure.\nThe Democrats' leader in the US Senate, Chuck Schumer, said he would bring legislation on Monday evening seeking to end the ban, although the measure stood little chance of being passed by the Republican-led Congress.", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-01-31T01:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T11:38:18.373+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
