INQUIRER FILE PHOTO / RICHARD A. REYES \nMANILA — The Department of Education (DepEd) is set to train regional and school division personnel next month in preparation for the implementation of the mandatory drug testing of public high school students, elementary and secondary school teachers and personnel. \nIn a Feb. 8 memorandum, Education Secretary Leonor Briones said the random drug testing in schools would be part of the department’s efforts to step up the implementation of the National Education Drug Program in support of President Duterte’s war on illegal drugs. \nTo prepare for the roll-out of the drug testing in schools, Briones announced the holding of an orientation-training on the drug testing program in eight clusters from March 1 to April 28 . ADVERTISEMENT \nThe training aims to make DepEd and school staff aware of the legal and regulatory aspect of drug testing and discuss among themselves the initial assessment and intervention for students found positive for drug use. \nAt the training, regional and school division personnel will be coached on specimen collection, validity testing and on documentation and recording of the drug testing procedures. They will also be taught how to formulate an action plan for the conduct of the random drug testing, according to Briones. \nIn an earlier interview, Briones said the DepEd would start the random drug testing for students next school year but only for “sampling basis.” Briones has assured testing will only be done with the consent of parents and with counseling, she added. \nBriones stressed that the random drug testing among students would be done very carefully in the same manner that the agency has been circumspect with reproductive health issues and education \nBut Briones vowed to be firm with teachers and other school personnel found positive for drug abuse. They would be disallowed to continue working until completely rehabilitated, she said. \n“If a teacher or a staff member is positive for drugs, [he or she] has to take a leave until rehabilitated,” said Briones. \n“You cannot just allow them to continue working then once a week they go see a doctor. They have to take a leave and a doctor has to certify that they can go back to work,” she added.
