The Interior Department, which announced the rule in December, said that it would protect 6,000 miles of streams and 52,000 acres of forests, preventing coal mining debris from being dumped into nearby waters. \nFor outrage’s sake, multiple MSM outlets refer to the rule as “Obama-era,” despite the fact that it was only established this past December : This regulation was issued by Obama during his final weeks in office. Love how everyone is pretending it's been around forever. https://t.co/YSRprgarwi \nBut just for good measure, they’re kicking the outrage factor up several notches another way. \nFor example, you’ve gotta hand it to CNN here.
