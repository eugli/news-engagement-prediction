These episodes that were filmed this evening will be the last shows before NXT Takeover: Orlando . \nThe heart of the matter \nOne-half of the “Iconic Duo”, Billie Kay, may have suffered a pretty significant injury during the tapings tonight. Kay was wrestling Ember Moon, who ended up victorious after hitting her Eclipse finisher on the Australian after a quick match. \nHowever, she may have been injured by the move, as referees and other officials flooded into the ring after the match was over to check on her.

However, she was holding her neck and crying as she was heading back to the locker room, which is never good news. Billie is up.

That is the facility that takes care of the majority of injured WWE and NXT stars when something like this happens. \nIt’s unfortunate timing, though, as Kay was really hitting her stride recently from a character standpoint, as well as improving in the ring on an almost weekly basis. Hopefully, nothing is seriously wrong, and it would seem that way from the fact that she was able to leave the ring under her own power. \nHowever, the fact that she was clutching at her neck and crying as she was walking back to the locker room is highly concerning. She may have been crying out of fear of what had just happened, or because she was upset at the situation. \nEither way, we’ll have an update on this situation as it becomes available. We wish Billie Kay all the best and hope for a speedy recover if she has to miss any time. \nSend us news tips at fightclub@sportskeeda.com Recommended", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T11:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T09:11:09.882+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
