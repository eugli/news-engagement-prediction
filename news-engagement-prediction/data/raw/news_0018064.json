'I didn't feel like it aligned with my values and certainly not in a way I choose to represent myself publicly,' she said. A source who leaked the advertisement this week described the poster as 'backwards and inappropriate'. Conference organisers Waseem Razvi insisted the move was made to protect the women from right-wing extremists. OUT: Monique Toohey said the conference 'didn't align with my values' 'Muslim women are particularly (being) humiliated and targeted in our streets, threatened and abused on social media,' he said. 'Due to the growing Islamophobia our campaign team wanted to be extra cautious with female guests so they wouldn't be targeted in the streets.' But while Ms Toohey told 3AW that may have been one factor, she said some organisers did not believe women should show their faces in public. Host Tom Elliott asked: 'Is it possible ... this conference is organised by a very conservative strain of Islam that honestly believes women should not show their faces in public?' Ms Toohey replied: 'I don't think that's very far from the truth at all. 'There's definitely people on the committee of the conference that believe that, but that's not something I believe'. After a social media squall, one of the organisers, Mr Razvi, apologised on Wednesday to critics who felt it was inappropriate. Several people in the Islamic community were scathing in their criticism on Facebook. 'When Muslim women are made further invisible by our community bloody oathe,' wrote psychologist Hanan Dover. 'This flyer is wrong on so many levels,' said another Facebook commenter. A third said: 'This is unbelievable'. An Islamic community source who showed the ad to Daily Mail Australia said: 'It's backwards and inappropriate'. 'These are knowledgeable and professional women - this reduces them to faceless beings'. 'We never wanted anybody to feel this was inappropriate,' said Mr Razvi, who acts as a spokesman for organisers the Islamic Research and Education Academy (IREA). The faces of Monique Toohey (left) and social worker Nina Trad Azam (right) were inexplicably not included in the poster - instead replaced with blacked-out faces in veils In a later statement, Mr Razvi added: 'IREA would like to assure the community of the respectful nature of the event and its organisers. 'Indeed, IREA welcomes any members of the community who may have misgivings or misunderstandings about Islam, Muslims or even this event to attend any relevant session and seek clarification from the many qualified Islamic & faith speakers present. 'As with all of IREAâ€™s events, the conference is being held in good faith and with genuine intentions. 'All are welcome to attend, and we look forward to greeting you on the day. ' The flyer still remains on official social media pages.
