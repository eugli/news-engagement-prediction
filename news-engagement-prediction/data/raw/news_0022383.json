Rick Snyder sent Flint’s Interim Chief Financial Officer, David Sabuda, a letter saying the credits currently being applied to the water portion of Flint utility customers’ accounts will stop after Feb. 28, according to a news release from the City of Flint. \n“I am aware that the water quality in the City of Flint is improving and that is a good thing,” Mayor Karen Weaver said. “We knew the state’s assistance with these water-related expenses would come to an end at some point. I just wish we were given more notice so we at City Hall, and the residents, had more time to prepare for the changes.” \nThe letter noted the latest six-month cycle of water testing had results below the federal action level for the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR), results that support the findings of November 2016 tests from sites showing Flint’s water had a 90th percentile value of 8 ppb. \nThe letter said that, due to the levels, “the payments of water credits on Flint’s active water customer accounts, which have covered water usage since April 2014, will continue for water used through the end of February,\" according to the city. \nMarch billing statements will be the last bills that include the state water relief credits of 20% for commercial accounts and 65% for residential accounts . Overall, officials say more than $40.4 million in water relief credits has been applied to the accounts of Flint water system customers.
