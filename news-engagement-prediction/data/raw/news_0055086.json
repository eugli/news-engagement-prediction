Politicians are shamelessly and actively legitimising all sorts of hateful rhetoric and policies based on people's identity: misogyny, racism and homophobia. The first target has been refugees and, if this continues in 2017, others will be in the crosshairs.\" \nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment on the report. \nAmnesty's report cited an example of divisive propaganda in the UK. \nIn June, the former leader of the far-right, anti-immigration United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), Nigel Farage, infamously unveiled a poster showing a queue of refugees with the slogan \"Breaking Point: The EU has failed us all\" as he campaigned for Brexit. \n\"The [UK] government has shirked its responsibility for the global refugee crisis, pushing thousands of vulnerable people into the hands of people smugglers. \n\"Its decision to prematurely close the Dubs Amendment scheme to bring unaccompanied refugee children already in Europe to the UK is shameful,\" the report said. \nHolding the world accountable \nThe annual study, \"The State of the World's Human Rights\", documented what it called \"grave violations of human rights\" in 159 countries in 2016, including Bangladesh, Thailand, Honduras and Myanmar , where \"tens of thousands of Rohingya people - who remain deprived of a nationality - have been displaced by 'clearance operations' amid reports of unlawful killings\". \nIt said governments \"turned a blind eye to war crimes, pushed through deals that undermine the right to claim asylum, passed laws that violate free expression, incited murder of people simply because they are accused of using drugs, justified torture and mass surveillance, and extended draconian police powers.\" \nThe report added that \"the big question in 2017 will be how far the world lets atrocities go before doing something about them\". \nExceptionally, London-based Amnesty chose to launch its report in Paris. \nShetty said France has used emergency powers introduced in 2015 in the wake of attacks in an abusive and \"deeply discriminatory\" manner, confining more than 600 people, mostly Muslims, under house arrest and banning more than 140 protests. \n\"Even states that once claimed to champion rights abroad are now too busy rolling back human rights at home to hold others to account,\" Amnesty said. \n\"The more countries backtrack on fundamental human rights commitments, the more we risk a domino effect of leaders emboldened to knock back established human rights protections.\" \nFrance's government has repeatedly defended the emergency powers as a necessary safeguard against the severe security threat it says is facing the country, and parliament has repeatedly voted to extend those powers.
