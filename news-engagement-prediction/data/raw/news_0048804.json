It could impact investment in places that most need it, in areas of the country where there is already a marginal call on investment.\" How are business rates calculated? \nRates are calculated by multiplying the rateable value of a property by a multiplier set by the government. But as property values change over time, rateable values need to be reassessed periodically - usually every five years. \nHowever, this update to property values is two years behind schedule, making it a harder pill to swallow in areas where the price of real estate has been rising. \nAccording to analysts, Sainsbury's will see its annual rates rise to £500m, up from £483m, while internet giant Amazon will see its bill cut. \nPubs, NHS hospitals and hotels in some areas are also said to be facing increases in their business rates.
