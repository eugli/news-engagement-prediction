Trump motorcade hit by 2x4, 5 students face charges posted by @JoshOnDC101 - \nFrom the AP via Fox13 \nAuthorities say a vehicle in President Donald Trump's motorcade was struck by a \"2x4\" and five middle school students are now facing charges. \nPalm Beach County Sheriff's office spokeswoman Teri Barbera said in a statement Saturday that the incident happened Friday around 1:45 p.m. \nOfficers assisting the U.S. Secret Service reported that a vehicle in the motorcade had been struck by what was believed to be a small, hard object. \nSeveral members of the motorcade returned to the scene after completing the motorcade to look for witnesses and objects along the roadway. \nA child from a local middle school confessed to throwing the wood at the motorcade and also implicated four additional students. \nCharges will be filed with the Palm Beach County States Attorney's Office. \nNo additional information was given.
