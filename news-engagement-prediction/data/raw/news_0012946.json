Cox / Getty Images Tom Brady celebrates with owner Robert Kraft in the locker room after defeating the Atlanta Falcons, in Super Bowl 51, at NRG Stadium on Feb. 5 in Houston. February 06, 2017 Congrats, Pats! Sunday’s Super Bowl victory was indeed one for the ages, a story of grit and skill and guts and never-say-die determination, an against-all-odds comeback that secured Tom Brady’s crown as the most accomplished quarterback of all time and Bill Belichick’s reputation as a coach nonpareil. \nOf course, it wouldn’t be a true Boston story without the crosscurrents of controversy caused by the admiring friendships that Brady, Belichick, and owner Robert Kraft have with President Donald Trump, relationships that have vexed some in this deep-blue state. That plays into another of Boston’s favorite diversions — political argument. \nBut regardless of where one comes down on that matter, as sheer pulse-pounding sports drama and emotional roller coaster ride, this was as unforgettable as it was unprecedented. It’s another savory reward for the long glory-starved early years of the franchise, during which disappointment and dismay defined Patriots fandom. \nAnd, remarkable as seven Super Bowl appearances and five Lombardi Trophies in the Brady-Belichick era seem, this is a dynasty whose key figures aren’t done yet.
