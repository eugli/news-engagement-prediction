Céline Dion may have paid homage to “My Heart Will Go On” with her latest look in Vegas. The singer was in town for a press conference to promote her first handbag and accessory collection, but it was her Elsa Schiaparelli couture outfit that stole the show and seemed to have a deeper meaning. Dion wore a look from the label’s spring 2017 collection —a white, polka-dotted mini dress with a white jacket emblazoned with a heart pierced by two golden arrows. If the outfit is, in fact, a nod to her 1997 Oscar-winning song for James Cameron’s Titanic , it wouldn’t be her first time doing so. Since teaming up with Zendaya’s stylist, Law Roach , in 2016, Dion has become a surprise style star, opting for trendier pieces like jumpsuits and leather duster coats. She cemented this status in July 2016, when she was spotted in Paris wearing a Vetements oversized hoodie that Roach pulled from the brand’s archives. The hoodie featured Jack and Rose, the main characters from Titanic , demonstrating that Dion was not only able to wink at fans, but also hip enough to wear Vetements. While her earlier tribute was anything but subtle, it makes the possibility of a “My Heart Will Go On” hat tip all the more plausible with her latest look.
