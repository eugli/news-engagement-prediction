According to a new report prepared by the Saudi American Public Relation Affairs Committee (SAPRAC), Dr. Al-Eissa recently welcomed representatives of different sects \"along with the Vatican delegate in this spirituality focused meeting, where the values of respect, tolerance and openness towards other religions and sects were emphasized\". \nThere were some others in the religious establishment who would not participate in this gathering unless they \"would act as debaters or opposers..\". The report states that the Secretary General of the Muslim World League has stressed that \"Islam warned against the forceful imposition of views, and that Islam has coexisted peacefully with other religious in the past. This has set the tone of the religious dialogue to that of politeness and respect for the other side's humanity and dignity.\" \nA concise overview is given, in the report , of the current Secretary General of the Muslim World League's efforts to emphasize Islam's values of peace, tolerance, and coexistence, all of which are antithetical to the fundamentalist view of Islam that extremists are using to further their terrorist activities. Accordingly , Al-Eissa is the main figurehead for promoting the true version of Islam, which encourages peace, tolerance and coexistence. \nFinally, while critics may suggest that these values are also incompatible with the predominant and traditional Saudi religious establishment, nevertheless, one should look at the issue more meticulously as it has become clear that Saudi Arabia is taking the ideological war against extremism seriously, especially through the narrative that the current Secretary General of the Muslim World League, Al-Eissa, brings to the fore; an accepting, welcoming, and pluralistic narrative.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T13:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T10:34:19.090+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
