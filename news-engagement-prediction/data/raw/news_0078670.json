Vandoorne stopped at the entry to the pit lane after completing only a handful of laps early on, and then had to be pushed back to his garage by McLaren mechanics. The 32-year-old Briton's best lap was comfortably the quickest time of the week so far Later in the session, Vandoorne, last but one in the timesheets, lost power from his Honda engine which then had to be replaced - more crucial time lost for the British team with just eight days of testing ahead of the new season. Jolyon Palmer, the only other British driver beyond Hamilton on the grid this year, was also due to get his first proper taste of the new Renault. But the 26-year-old completed just one lap after his team spent the morning fitting new parts to his car which arrived in Barcelona overnight. The opening test of the season concludes on Thursday. Ferrari were second - Kimi Raikkonen managed 47 laps and was 1.8 seconds slower RELATED ARTICLES ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T20:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T16:40:26.453+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
