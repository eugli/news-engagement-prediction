Sources told TOI that when Dhawan was told about the selectors' decision to make him the captain, he opted to consult Gambhir first before letting them know his decision. This may have spoiled his chance to lead the team.\nALSO READ: Rishabh Pant replaces Gambhir as Delhi one-day captain\nA Delhi selector confirmed that Dhawan was a definite choice. But it was revealed that the selectors were in no mood to wait. \"One of the selectors first offered Dhawan the job. Dhawan told him that he would consult Gambhir before taking any call,\" a source close to Dhawan told TOI.\nAnother source revealed Dhawan didn't want to disturb the hierarchy of the Delhi team by taking up the captaincy mantle when he could also be seen representing India, as he is the third replacement Test opener after Murali Vijay and KL Rahul. \"He didn't want to be seen someone who is ambitious to take captaincy,\" the source said.\nEarlier too, the Delhi selectors had offered Virender Sehwag to lead the team but the Delhi dasher always batted for Gambhir to do the job. Sources also said that the Delhi selectors also had plans to blood a young player like Pant during the 2017-18 Ranji Trophy season in India. \"Once you have taken the tough call on asking Gambhir not to captain in the shorter version of the game, it is more or less a message given to him that the selectors are also open for new leadership in future,\" the source added.\nHowever, it looks clear that this decision to drop Gambhir from captain may lead to several issues like the selectors facing flak for taking such a decision. \"We have to see how the rest of Delhi cricket reacts to this,\" another insider said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T20:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T05:42:03.357+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
