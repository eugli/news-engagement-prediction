There coaches there were just truthful about everything they said. They have great experience. Coach [Mel] Tucker coached in the NFL for a while. Coach Smart coached at Alabama and had some great defenses there. It’s a great place.”\nThe 6-foot-2, 184 pound defender, who likely projects to cornerback upon arrival to Athens, was excited about the opportunity to play for the Bulldogs from the start.\n“Georgia’s program is really great. It’s in the building process, but it’s going to be great,” Brini said shortly before receiving his offer.\nHe chose the Bulldogs over FIU and USF.\nMore to come.\nEdit", "external_links": ["https://res-3.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/ddneihu1ffdhdz8whouv)", "https://res-3.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/ddneihu1ffdhdz8whouv"], "published": "2017-02-01T20:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T21:06:47.875+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
