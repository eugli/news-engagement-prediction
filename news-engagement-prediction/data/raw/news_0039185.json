In this series, we take a little more time to pause and reflect. Sally Singer, Creative Digital Director, Vogue.com How to begin a conversation about New York Fashion Week when the week itself seemed a bit of a nonstarter? Yes, there were some terrific shows—from Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen for The Row, a complete wardrobe for a modern Katharine Hepburn; at Gypsy Sport, an impassioned plea to recognize the humanity of those who are displaced and to celebrate creativity in desperate times. Yes, there was a slew of fantastic and desirable mega-jackets; you will not lack for an oversize thigh-grazing topper come fall. And yes, there was, at long last, diversity in every sense on the runways. Age, ethnicity, sex, size: Beauty came in many guises, and thank God for that. The Row Photo: Courtesy of The Row So there was much to applaud. And yet I think I was not alone in hoping for style to have a more extraordinary response to the rather extraordinary times we now (sadly) live in. Buttons, slogans, and message tees are fine—they make pictures that are seen globally and register resistance—but they are not enough. I woke up every morning of Fashion Week hoping to be dazzled, transported, provoked, simply moved by the goings-on of the day. And I missed greatly the presence of Rodarte and Hood By Air on the New York calendar, two shows that for me are always emotional and directional. Paris will be lucky to host them this year. Gypsy Sport Photo: Marcus Tondo / Indigital.tv One trend that I think will continue through Europe but I find peculiar in the extreme is the return of trouser suits that nod to Wall Street and “mean business.” There was a bunch of them in New York and from designers as different in clientele as Alexander Wang and Raf Simons for Calvin Klein. Many were terrific. But I couldn’t help think how odd it is that that sort of tailoring would return just as the public’s confidence in bankers and all implied associations has never been lower. Who is actually meant to wear all this suiting? Is it for executives or for those who dress for “executive realness”? The ghost of ’90s vogue balls haunted the runways, at least for me, and this seemed both fabulous and tragic. Now more than ever we need astonishing direction and great beauty of a like we have yet to encounter. Calvin Klein Photo: Yannis Vlamos / Indigital.tv Nicole Phelps, Director, Vogue RunwayI agree with you Sally; designers seem less inspired and agitated about “the current situation” than they do stymied. More than ever, New York Fashion Week felt like a grab bag of wardrobing collections, beautiful clothes for beautiful lives, many of which I liked quite a bit: Gabriela Hearst, Victoria Beckham, The Row. All designed by women, it’s worth pointing out. Victoria Beckham Photo: Umberto Fratini / Indigital.tv Big ideas, if they came along, had more to do with the how of fashion shows than with the fashion itself. I thought Rag & Bone’s and Zac Posen’s 15th anniversary photo exhibitions were big successes: Vanina Sorrenti’s portraits of Carolyn Murphy and Hilary Rhoda et al. wearing Posen’s Fall collection were stunning and serene, and Rag & Bone’s “real people” pics captured the street-ready appeal of Marcus Wainwright’s brand better than any catwalk ever did. Kanye West latched onto a similar idea with the video projections at his much-improved Yeezy season 5 presentation: We’ve all gotten mightily accustomed to viewing the action through a screen. Rag & Bone Photo: Courtesy of Rag & Bone By my reckoning, the most-buzzed-about event was the artist Bjarne Melgaard’s off-calendar, not–quite–Fashion Week art show, “The Casual Pleasure of Disappointment.” Guests were invited to dig through $500,000 worth of discarded clothes and take what they wanted, like a giant Bitch ’n’ Swap. Who doesn't love one of those? The interactivity of it was the turn-on. There could be a lesson in there for a fashion show system in such a state of flux. And it picks up on an idea Hearst pitched that I liked a lot: sourcing and making use of goods that already exist; Hearst’s, of course, are Loro Piana. Gabriela Hearst Photo: Yannis Vlamos / Indigital.tv Maya Singer, Contributing Editor Sally, Nicole: Between the two of you, you’ve already registered my general impression of the New York shows. I agree, Sally, that the focus on banker-style suiting is really odd—I mean, I’m as much of a sucker for pinstripes and Prince of Wales check as the next gal, but the semiotics of this trend worry me. Best-case scenario, designers are suggesting that we don the most useful disguise available, the better to infiltrate the power structure and enact subversions. But in a season where there was a lot of punting going on, I’m more inclined to believe this was an homage to the power structure itself. The only show that didn’t strike me that way was Thom Browne’s: He, more than anyone, seized on the trouser suit, making it the linchpin of his entire collection, but there was something in the fragility of his intarsia fabrications that spoke to the current mood in society, that feeling you encounter everywhere that things are right on the verge of falling apart. There were lots of suits in Browne’s lineup, but no power suits. Thom Browne Photo: Luca Tombolini / Indigital.tv And Nicole, your aside about some of the strongest collections this season coming from women likewise resonates. My favorite of all the shows I saw in New York was Maria Cornejo’s, for the simple reason that it seemed purposeful. As I wrote in my review, some of that had to do with the fact that Cornejo has committed herself to making her collections as sustainable as possible—when people are falling all over themselves trying to figure out how to take action in a fraught, fast-moving political situation, Cornejo can be confident in the work she’s already doing to make change. But the purposefulness also derived from her comprehension of her customers. She knows what they need and she knows how to please them. That understanding undergirded other woman-designed collections I liked, too—Rosetta Getty’s, for instance, and the collection Rachel Comey showed in Los Angeles. Public School Photo: Luca Tombolini / Indigital.tv You don’t have to be a woman to know your audience. And I think it’s worth giving a shout-out to both Maxwell Osborne and Dao-Yi Chow of Public School, who showed their most accomplished collection yet this season, and Jeremy Scott, who served up the most interesting response to the events in the news of all the shows I saw in New York. As opposed to defaulting to gestures of militancy, Scott promoted love and hedonism as a form of resistance. I left Scott’s show feeling like I wanted to make use of every ounce of freedom that I have. And maybe a few ounces of freedom I just have to claim for myself, rules and regulations be damned. Chioma Nnadi, Fashion News Director, Vogue.com Like many people, I went into Fashion Week with a heavyheart—a certain guilt and perhaps the same angst that many designers were feeling. It was almost impossible for me to look at the runway without scrutinizing references for a political subtext. The Calabasas pieces at Yeezy are one such example. As much as I was coveting the retro-inspired tracksuits, faded denim pants, and slouchy shearling jackets, something about the branding itself gave me pause. At any other time, the idea of wearing a shirt printed with the name of an affluent California suburb, populated by exclusive gated communities, wouldn’t have really bothered me. But given the divided state of this nation, it felt to me a bit like a slogan tee for the 1 percent, even with the Black Panther iconography. Of course, this exclusive world is West’s reality, and yet it’s not a place that many of the fans who buy his clothes will ever know. The notion of aspirational branding is certainly nothing new, and perhaps this was his way of subverting it. Even still, it had me thinking about Chicago, West’s hometown, and the disadvantaged neighborhoods that could benefit from a little positive attention right now. Yeezy Photo: Courtesy of Yeezy As you rightfully pointed out, Sally, the best fashion is thought-provoking, challenging, and dazzling. I was also impressed and moved by Gypsy Sport’s show. Rio Uribe managed to channel his frustration with social injustice into a fashion statement that brought his community together—the models dressed in his fantastic clothes were friends and young people scouted at the Women’s March and Muslim Ban rallies for the most part. Section 8 Photo: Courtesy of Section 8 There has been a communal spirit bubbling up in fashion for the past year, and the latest crew to come on the scene is a collective known as Section 8. They made a surprising debut at a tiny gallery in Chinatown with clothes that turned the idea of executive realness inside out—in addition to off-kilter pin-striped suiting and deconstructed shirting, there were vintage Fubu sweatshirts refashioned as pencil skirts. It was, they said, how they imagined an intern working on the Trump campaign might dress. Not clothes for the resistance per se, but certainly fashion to command your attention. Despite whatever else is happening in the world, it was encouraging to see young designers stake their claim on New York Fashion Week in this way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T21:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T16:29:17.117+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
