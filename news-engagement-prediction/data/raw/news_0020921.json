Advertisement \n\"Premiums have been rising relentlessly above inflation every year for the past 17 years,\" CEO Leanne Wells said. \n\"At the same time, the coverage of many health policies has tended to shrink. It is time for the federal government to take real action to keep health insurance costs within reach of average income earners and to make policies more consumer-friendly. \n\"With many families now facing premiums of around $5000 a year, it is unacceptable to maintain a regulatory system that results in people holding complicated and uncertain policies for coverage of a declining range of services.\" \nComparison website iSelect Health expect a bump in the number of enquiries, as people review their policies in the wake of the latest premium increase. \nIn 2015, the average price increase was 6.18 per cent, while last year it rose by about 5.59 per cent. \nSpokeswoman Laura Crowden said in 2016, iSelect saw \"an almost 60 per cent increase in private health insurance enquiries\", as people looked to save money. \n\"This year's earlier announcement gives policyholders more time to review their cover, shop around for better value and potentially make a switch,\" she said. \n\"It also gives savvy customers time to pre-pay their annual premiums upfront and avoid the rate rise for 12 months.\" \nConsumers are already showing increasing levels of frustration with their funds, with the Private Health Ombudsman reporting a record number of complaints in the past financial year, with 4416 lodging grievances in 2015-16. \nThe majority of complaints included medical gap payments, extra or ancillary benefits and hospital exclusions and restrictions, including definition disputes, such as when hand surgery was deemed \"joint replacement\" by one insurer, and not covered, despite no bones being replaced. \nSince 2007, health funds have been made to apply to the health minister before increasing their premiums, detailing their financial performance, and estimated costs. \nHealth Minister Greg Hunt said private health insurance was \"an important part of the system\", with about 13 million Australians having some level of private cover. \n\"Individuals have to make their own choice, and many people, many people want the security, they want the choice, and they want the coverage of private health insurance,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T11:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T06:17:33.806+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
