The couple's bodies were left lying on the street outside the store (Photo: Wales News Service) The murder scene on Queens street in Cardiff (Photo: Wales News) Read More Mum reports burglar son who poured himself a pint and then pinched charity boxes after seeing him on CCTV \nHe then posted a status on Facebook saying: \"F***\". \nPolice later found notes he left before the killings saying “I think ISIS are the good guys most of the time and that’s pretty messed up\" and “No one will forget me.” \nBoth victims suffered eight stab wounds each. \nThe court heard a witness saw Saunders walking on Queen Street in the early hours of the morning “looking agitated”. Floral tributes are outside the Matalan store (Photo: Wales News Service) A large section of Cardiff city centre was closed off following the killings (Photo: Wales News) \nJust hours before the killings he searched \"how to slice a neck\" online as well as other terms such as \"motivation for killing\", \"motivation for revenge\" and \"how to smoke a cigar\". \nMiss Morgan and Mr Simmons met at work in July 2016 and started dating a short time later. \nNews of their relationship sent Saunders into a spiral of fury as he searched terms online including \"16 steps to kill someone and not get caught\", \"How long do murders get in prison?\" and \"How to get a gun illegally UK\". \nA week before the murders he searched murder methods, including \"How to knife someone’s neck\" and \"How can a car be rigged to explode when started\". \nHe also messaged Miss Morgan telling her he still loved her. \nWhen arrested by police, Saunders said he wanted to know if the couple were both dead for \"peace of mind\". Floral tributes were left by shocked shoppers (Photo: PA) The store was closed following the attack (Photo: PA) \nHe told officers: \"Sometimes, you just snap. I’m really sorry for what I did. I just lost control. \n“Your head is a weird thing. Have you ever been involved with someone? \n“Are they both dead? I just want to know for peace of mind.” \nDefending, Winston Roddick told the court Saunders was badly affected by the death of his grandfather and had left suicide notes before the killings. \nHe said: \"They paint a picture of his state of mind and the struggle he was having through life. \n\"His judgement was undoubtedly impaired by a combination of factors. \n\"He is genuinely remorseful for what he has done and more than once said he wishes to turn the clock back.\" \nThe two-day sentencing hearing will conclude tomorrow.
