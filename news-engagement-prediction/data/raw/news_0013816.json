He missed a game-winning 27-yarder Oct. 24 at Arizona, in a game that ended up a 6-6 tie. \nWalsh had his own struggles last season, going 12 of 16 on field goals and 15 of 19 on extra points before being released by the Minnesota Vikings. Walsh famously missed a game-winning 27-yarder against the Seahawks in a 2015 NFC wild-card loss. \nUnderstandably, Seattle fans were stuck trying to put a positive spin on The Blair Walsh Project: Part 2. At least we know Blair Walsh has already won a game for the @Seahawks … shaking my head. pic.twitter.com/SxdqVS4H2M \n— Kaitlyn Fletcher (@kait_flet) February 9, 2017 Guys please help spread awareness as we protest this together.
