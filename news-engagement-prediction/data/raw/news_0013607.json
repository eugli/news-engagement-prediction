He was evidently emotional as the crowd gave him a rapturous applause. Pierce was then given a standing ovation by the Garden crowd as his name was called out. \nAs tipoff neared, the camera caught the 39-year-old giving Lucky the Leprechaun one last kiss. Pierce was also wired by the NBA and the microphone picked up some great snippets. \nThere was a rousing tribute on the jumbotron that almost brought the emotional Pierce to tears and there were spontaneous chants of 'we want Paul' throughout the game. \nWith 19 seconds to go and the game all but over, the TD Garden crowd were treated to one last look at Pierce. He went on to nail a three - his only basket of the game - much to the delight of the home fans.
