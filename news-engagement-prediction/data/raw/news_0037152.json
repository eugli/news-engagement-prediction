This project, if not properly handled, can cause a breach of the peace. NPDC/Elcrest should beware. \n“Since the coming of NPDC/Elcrest, people of the host communities have not been employed. When contracts are to be awarded for jobs, no bidding is made. They are awarded to one person or a clique that has been monopolizing contracts in the community. The bidding is not made open to community executives except the clique. \n“We are aware that drilling operations shall commence soon based on a purported EIA of February 2015. This drilling shall not commence if the Tsekelewu people do not get 40 per cent of the contracts arising from the drilling operations.” \nWhen contacted, a staff of the External Relations Department, NPDC, Benin City, who pleaded anonymity, said: “There in no operation going on there now. We have been meeting with them. They have not showed us any document. If they have any issue, they should send it and we will attend to it.” Okogba", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T10:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T06:26:07.785+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
