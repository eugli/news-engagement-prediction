From its cast and crew to its locations, everything is Gujarati. Even the music is being composed by Gujarati musical duo, Samir-Mana . One of their songs, 'Sapno Se Bhara Piggy Bank' has some really unusual instruments. Says Mana Raval, \"The song plays when all the school children who went for a picnic, get up in the middle of a forest in the morning and notice the natural beauty around them. It's a song about joy and happiness. We have used everything from empty ketchup bottles, upturned buckets, plastic oil cans, empty air freshner boxes, pots and pans and much more apart from our usual percussions to make the song. We are currently recording it and are planning to use some more unusual instruments like firecrackers and more.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T21:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:53:07.313+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
