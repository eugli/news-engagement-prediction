What you need to know about this week's Tube strike \n\"Our members will be sent out from pillar to post to plug gaps that are solely down to staffing shortages. \n\"With massive budget cuts in the pipeline at LU this is a straw in the wind as to how the company expects to operate in the future.\" \nNormal service is expected to resume on Thursday morning. \nFor updates follow TfL on Twitter or visit the Transport for London website.
