Related Articles The best of the London Bike Show 2017 – Gallery Pinarello unveiled the Dogma F10 last month and the bike is equipped with new aerodynamic features. The tabs on the rear of the fork dropouts are inspired by Bradley Wiggins' hour record bike and the concave downtube, inspired from the Bolide time trial frame, claims to reduce drag by 12.6 per cent versus the previous incarnation of the bike. Also on the downtube, Pinarello has introduced an E-Link system, which can charge and update the new Shimano Dura-Ace 9150 Di2 groupset. The bike features the latest electronic groupset components from Shimano, whilst the crankset and wheels remained Dura-Ace 9000 series due to a shortage of new cranks and a high enough quantity of wheelsets respectively. \nEllisonde rides a size 44 frameset, 170mm cranks and a 112mm stem combined with narrow 380mm handlebars. The handlebar tape, handlebars and stem are all supplied by ONE components and the bike is complimented with an all black Fizik Arione saddle.
