(Eric Sondheimer and Lindsey Thiry) \nTugging at the blue-and-gold Bruins cap on his head, Juarez says, “Guess I just had to get away for a while. Figure things out.” \n:: \nThis isn’t one of those stories where a promising young athlete contracts a serious illness or runs afoul of the law. Juarez’s struggle is not painted in such bold or clearly defined strokes. \nHis uncles and cousins played football, so he grew up around the game. Todd Croce, the coach at North, was considered a family friend. \n“Mique’s a football player,” Croce says. “It’s in his DNA, it’s what he is designed to do.” \nIf Juarez’s talents were obvious from a young age, so was his passion for the game. The young man had what coaches call “a motor,” racing tirelessly around the field. \nAnd when his team fell behind or officials made a dubious call, he could not help showing his displeasure. “Sometimes,” he says, “I let things get to me.” \nIt was odd because off the field the teenager was generally good-natured and apt to keep his feelings hidden. \nMaybe no one fully understood the pressure he felt during his senior season as The Times named him its 2015 player of the year and he rose to the level of a five-star prospect, listed among the nation’s top outside linebackers by ESPN and others. \n“All the attention it brought,” he says. “I didn’t know how to handle it.” Ben Bolch UCLA linebacker Mique Juarez said Tuesday he hoped to return to practice as soon as next week after a nearly six-week absence caused by the mental strain of being a highly acclaimed freshman and another personal matter he declined to discuss.\n“Being the top [high school] linebacker in the nation,... \nUCLA linebacker Mique Juarez said Tuesday he hoped to return to practice as soon as next week after a nearly six-week absence caused by the mental strain of being a highly acclaimed freshman and another personal matter he declined to discuss. \n“Being the top [high school] linebacker in the nation,... (Ben Bolch) \nAfter initially committing to USC, Juarez leaned toward Alabama, then switched to UCLA, saying he wanted to play near family and friends. The decision brought relief, if only temporarily. \n“The day I signed that letter,” he recalls, “it was like that night I caught up on all my sleep.” \nGraduating from high school early, Juarez enrolled at UCLA in time to participate in last year’s spring practice. \nIt should not have been a surprise to discover that the college game was faster and more physical. Or that defensive schemes were more complex. \nMost freshmen face a jolt when they reach the next level. For Juarez, the seeds of doubt planted a little deeper. \n:: \nHis father always told him, “Never be average.” \nThose words fueled Juarez through high school, where he excelled not only on defense but also at quarterback, passing for 23 touchdowns and rushing for 36 in his final season. \n“He did everything he needed to get ready for college,” Croce says. “He looked ready to go.” \nAs the Bruins reported to summer camp in San Bernardino, there was talk of the freshman competing for a starting spot. The media mentioned him in the same sentence as a former Bruins star, the multi-talented Myles Jack. \n“He fit athletically and ability-wise on the field,” Mora recalls. “But I think there was an inner struggle … not everyone matures at the same rate.” \nEvery missed tackle and blown assignment put a dent in Juarez’s confidence. Even the smallest mistakes consumed him. \nPlaying under a microscope did not help. In those first days, there were suggestions on social media that he was overrated, having feasted on mediocre opponents in high school. \n“It was eating me up,” he says. “I felt like I had lost it, like I wasn’t good enough.” \nThis is where his story gets tricky, where some people have labeled him a quitter. Juarez acknowledges lacking the maturity to handle the situation and losing his hunger for the game. \nMora and linebacker coach Scott White realized they had a problem. \n“There are a lot of pressures — self-imposed pressure, family pressure, the outside pressure of trying to live up to the hype,” Mora says. “Part of our job is to recognize that everybody reacts differently and grows differently.” \nNot that football looks kindly upon players walking away but, with the coaches’ blessing, Juarez quietly left camp. \n:: \nThe Bruins opened last season ranked in the top 25, with hopes of maybe even reaching the Rose Bowl. Their new linebacker should have been part of the excitement, traveling with the team to Texas A&M for the opener. \nInstead, Juarez stayed home. News reports suggested that he might return within a week or two, but that didn’t happen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T08:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T05:06:05.092+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
