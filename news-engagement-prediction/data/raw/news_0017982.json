And it’s entirely possible that this show which grappled with the series subject of sexual assault all the while keeping its sense of humor intact won’t return. But canceling Sweet/Vicious now would be a huge mistake—especially because, political and social issues aside, this happens to be the most entertaining and nuanced show MTV currently has to offer. Like most TV shows that aired shortly after last November’s election, Sweet/Vicious was written and conceived of before America knew it would be entering a new regime under Donald Trump . But the already socially-aware show has taken on an even more urgent social and political relevancy—not just because it premiered the week after Hillary Clinton’s loss and concluded the week after Trump’s inauguration. The series—which deals with masculine entitlement, sexual assault, and female solidarity—wrapped up its first chapter with sorority girl protagonists making protests signs, just three days after the international Women’s March. With the recent confirmation of Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education and Title IX activists growing increasingly concerned about the future of campus sexual assault policies, now, more than ever, we need a show like Sweet/Vicious . Deadline reported Thursday that MTV has cancelled two of its low-performing freshman shows: Loosely Exactly Nicole and Mary + Jane . But though Sweet/Vicious was the network’s lowest-rated series last season, its fate is still in flux. “We love the characters and how the show relates to modern feminism,” MTV president Chris McCarthy told Deadline. “Its numbers were disappointing, but the sentiment for the show has been nothing but fantastic.” (The series enjoys a glowing 100% “fresh” rating on Rotten Tomatoes .) “ Sweet/Vicious is a story we think is incredibly important and very timely,” McCarthy told The Hollywood Reporter more encouragingly. “We’re trying to figure out what the right way to relaunch that and figure out what the next iteration of that is. No decision has been made yet but we love the show and are trying to figure that out.\" Clearly, the show—about a pair of unlikely friends who bond over their extracurricular habit of dealing out vigilante justice to campus rapists—didn’t quite land with audiences. That may be because its tone, as the title suggests, was occasionally incongruent. Fans of the 90s cult series Buffy the Vampire Slayer will, surely, be familiar with the sight of two powerful, pint-sized young women handing out beatdowns to villainous bad guys, punctuating their punches with wry quips. But violence and despair may pair a little easier with jokes when the evil in question is otherworldly. Unlike the threat of vampires or the occasional apocalypse, the very grounded stakes of Sweet/Vicious means that the show occasionally and unflinchingly gets “too real” going straight for the emotional jugular. Eliza Bennett , who plays Jules—the blonde-haired, “good girl” half of the crime-fighting duo—had to do a lot of heavy lifting in Season 1, as a once-perky sorority girl grappling with the weight of a sexual assault that inspired her vigilante makeover. Courtesy of MTV But if viewers stick with the show as it swings in tone from serious to light-hearted, then the sugar that comes with the salty tears makes for a delicious combination. Taylor Dearden as Ophelia—the tech-savvy, weed-dealing, sardonic half of the duo—and Brandon Mychal Smith ( so good on You’re The Worst ) as her closest friend, Harris, are both nimble comedic talents. If I had one wish for Sweet/Vicious Season 2, it would be for the show to turn its clever self-awareness on some of the sappier romantic plot threads. But, then again, this is a teen show—and if Buffy can choose between Spike and Angel while saving the world, then I suppose these girls can pine, too. And while the show’s solid writing, acting, and execution would be enough to justify giving it a second chance at the ratings it deserves, the political climate makes the show all more vital. Sweet/Vicious has some sharp points to make about masculine entitlement. “If I want it, I'm going to take it,” star athlete and Season 1 villain Nate Griffin ( Dylan McTee ) says echoing the taped sentiments many thought would cost Trump the election last fall. And the first season took aim at the existing inadequacies of Title IX—the federal law that governs sex discrimination, harassment and sexual assault on college campuses—without knowing the guidance would be on such shaky ground come 2017. During a highly-publicized confirmation hearing in January, Betsy DeVos’s remarks on Title IX set off alarm bells with campus safety advocates. The recently-confirmed Secretary gave a non-comittal response about upholding Title IX saying : “I know that there's a lot of conflicting ideas and opinions around that guidance.” But even before the hearing, advocates were worried about DeVos. Her $10,000 donation to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, which is challenging the standard of proof on victims of sexual assault in university hearings, had Title IX activists bracing for a fight. Before DeVos was confirmed, the nationwide student-led group End Rape on Campus and Know Your IX started the #DearBetsy campaign for survivors of sexual violence and their allies to share their stories on why upholding Title IX was so vital. In an interview with MTV.com , Sofie Karasek, director of education and co-founder of End Rape On Campus, explained what Title IX actually does: “It’s not just this pie-in-the-sky piece of legislation, but rather provides direct accommodations to students on the ground — like if you need a classroom change, or dormitory shift, or you’re trying to go to the library at hours when your perpetrator is going to be there.” Not every campus is lucky enough to have sweetly vicious vigilantes protecting its students. But while activism like the #DearBetsy campaign has proven, time and again, to be an important tool for educating Americans on social issues, it’s art that does the best job of engendering empathy. When a stories of campus rape victims being ignored, pressured not to report, and shamed into silence are wrapped up in a slick, entertaining package like Sweet/Vicious , it seems likely that viewers not personally affected by sexual assault might be more moved to fight to protect those who have been. (It surely can’t entirely be a coincidence that according to Gallop polls, national attitudes towards same-sex marriage started turning around in 2009—the year Modern Family’s Cam and Mitchell first invaded living rooms across the nation.) If we have to live in a world where college-aged women are statistically under an increased risk of being assaulted, and the Trump administration seems poised to roll back their protections, then at least we should have some sweet vigilante justice to go with the vicious truth of the world we live in. If you missed them the first time, every episode of Sweet/Vicious is currently streaming on MTV.com.
