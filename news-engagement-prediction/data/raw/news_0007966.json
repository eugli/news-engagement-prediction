Extremely fast corner and local product for the Dawgs. pic.twitter.com/koYY8FtLeg\n— Paul Maharry (@pmaharry) February 1, 2017 Eastside High School athlete Eric Stokes is the unquestionably the fastest man in the Peach State. He is the defending state track champion in the 100, 200 and 400 meters.\nHe is also a Bulldog.\nStokes committed and signed with Georgia just after 8:00 a.m. ET in Eastside's media center. He picked the Bulldogs over Ole Miss and Florida.\n\"It was just being around people I'm used to and it's like a brotherhood and I love the coaches,\" Stokes said.\nIn November of last year, the Bulldogs turned up the heat on Stokes, inviting him to two home games in a three week span. Then on January 20, Stokes took an official visit to Georgia.\n\"I love the program. I love the coaches and everything about it,\" Stokes said after his first visit. \"But I have to see everything else on my officials [visits] before I know where everybody stands.\"\nWith his official visits completed, Stokes decide to be a Bulldog.\n\"Georgia has been pretty consistent in recruiting me since they offered,\" Stokes said. \"They cannot believe how long I am. They say I am a raw talent and they can mold me into something who can lock down anybody in the future.\"\nStokes was believed to be close to committing in December as the idea of playing clos to home appealed to him.\n“Oh, it means a lot,\" he said. \"My whole mindset lately has been about thinking about how all my schools are out of state. I thought about how it’d be hard to see family when I leave. Now, with the in-state thing, they could pop up on me if I need something or need to run home real quick, so it’s pretty huge.”\n`\nEdit", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/pmaharry/status/826781256297938946", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/UGA?src=hash", "https://t.co/koYY8FtLeg"], "published": "2017-02-01T15:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T21:08:18.165+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
