Whether something good or bad happens in my life, we are set back in time by about 32 years,\" Gupta said.\nGupta said he accepts the law must take its course, but he still fears Reyat will go back to his old ways – a concern echoed by professor Andre Gerolymatos, co-director of Simon Fraser University’s terrorism program.\nIf Reyat were to reconnect with his associates, they would likely embrace him as a hero, according to Gerolymatos.\n\"It stands to reason that someone who has not divulged anything about his previous associations has done so for a reason: to maintain their trust,\" he said.\nThe professor also argued releasing Reyat even though he hasn't provided useful information to law enforcement sends the wrong message to potential terrorists.\n\"He knows a lot more information and it's remarkable that this man is allowed to go free,\" he said. \"Someone is not thinking. Someone is not appreciating the context of this man's life and what he has done to Canadians and what he might do in the future.\"\nReyat is serving a seven-year sentence for perjury for repeatedly lying in the Air India trial. He was granted statutory release from prison and transferred to a halfway house in January 2016, though the location was never disclosed to the public for privacy concerns.\nHe was previously convicted of manslaughter, possession of a restricted weapon, possession of explosives, making an explosive substance with the intent to cause an explosion, and other counts in connections with the bombings, for which he was sentenced to 15 years behind bars.\nReyat’s release conditions require that he avoid extremist propaganda and people he has reason to believe are involved in extremism, crime or politics.\nHe is also barred from making any contact, directly or indirectly, with his victims' families.\nReyat must undergo mental health counselling to address \"violence, empathy and cognitive disorders” as well, and he’s prohibited from possessing components that could be used to build explosive devices.\nWith files from The Canadian Press  \nRelated Stories Air India perjurer Inderjit Singh Reyat granted release to halfway house Air India bombing probe is 'active and ongoing': RCMP Photos Inderjit Singh Reyat waits outside B.C.
