(AP) THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Updated: Wednesday, February 22, 2017, 11:08 AM \nWASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered a new court hearing for a black Texas prison inmate who claims improper testimony about his race tainted his death sentence. \nThe justices voted 6-2 in favor of inmate Duane Buck. Buck had tried for years to get federal courts to look at his claim that his rights were violated when jurors were told by a defense expert witness that Buck was more likely to be dangerous in the future because he is black. \nChief Justice John Roberts said in his majority opinion that the federal appeals court that heard Buck's case was wrong to deny him a hearing. \nIn Texas death penalty trials, one of the \"special issues\" jurors must consider when deciding punishment is whether the defendant they've convicted would be a future danger. \nRoberts wrote that the testimony of Dr. Walter Quijano \"was potent evidence. Dr. Quijano's testimony appealed to a powerful racial stereotype — that of black men as 'violence prone.\" \nJustices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas dissented. \"Having settled on a desired outcome, the court bulldozes procedural obstacles and misapplies settled law to justify it,\" Thomas said. \nBuck was convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend and another man in 1995. \nHis case was among six in 2000 that then-Texas Attorney General John Cornyn in a news release said needed to be reopened because Quijano's statements were racially charged. In the other five cases, new punishment hearings were held and each convict again was sentenced to death. Cornyn, a Republican, is now the state's senior U.S. senator. \nBuck's lawyers contended the attorney general, by then Cornyn's successor Greg Abbott, broke a promise by contesting his case. But the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said that it could find nothing in the case record to indicate the state made an error or promised not to oppose any move to reopen the case. Abbott now is the state's governor. Join the Conversation:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:14:30.176+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
