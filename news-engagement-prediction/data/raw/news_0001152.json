UKIP's Paul Nuttall asked why he listed residence he's never been to as current \"home\" on nomination form. Party said he was moving today. pic.twitter.com/Q8kq1BekrS — Channel 4 News (@Channel4News) February 1, 2017 \nNuttall admitted he had not been to the address in Oxford Street. \nWhen Crick pointed out that candidates are meant to put their home on their nomination form, Nuttall replied: “It will be for the rest of the campaign.” \nThe 40-year-old denied accusations that the house is empty, saying “people are in it now”. \nCrick said: “The law says that when you sign the nomination form, you’re meant to put down your home at the time of the nomination. \n“That wasn’t your home. Your home as far as I’m aware is Bootle or somewhere.” \nNuttall said he did live in Bootle, but when it was put to him that he had written the wrong address on his nomination form, Nuttall responded: “No I haven’t. I’ll be in there and be there for the rest of the campaign.” UKIP spokesman says Paul Nuttall has NOW moved into empty Stoke home Nuttall claimed on nom forms as \"home address\" pic.twitter.com/gUznRqu4ln — Michael Crick (@MichaelLCrick) February 1, 2017 \nElectoral Commission rules state : “The candidate’s full home address must, by law, be included on the nomination form. You should advise candidates that business addresses are not legally permitted. \n“If any detail of the home address is wrong or omitted, the nomination is not automatically invalid if the description of the place is such as to be commonly understood.” \nUkip said Nuttall was in the process of moving into the property. \nUkip finished second in the battle for the Stoke seat in the 2015 General Election. \nThe party finished just 5,179 votes behind Labour and Ukip figures believe a focused operation in the area could deliver a victory. \nIt has been estimated that 70% of voters in Stoke-on-Trent Central backed Leave in last year’s EU referendum, despite Hunt campaigning for Remain.
