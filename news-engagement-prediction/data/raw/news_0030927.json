Malaysia can do without such people. \nSadly, in every country there is always a group that has been given both the space and time to prioritise the less significant matter as the national narrative. \nVersey: I highly recommend Muslim Consumers Association of Malaysia (PPIM) president Nadzim Johan to check out the following website . \nIt provides information to help him to understand how difficult it is to avoid pig altogether in this modern times due to the complex workings of the global food and processing industry. \nFor example, collagen taken from the pigs is converted into gelatine and it finds its way into numerous foodstuffs where it acts as a gelling agent. \nPig gelatine is used as a clarifying agent in wines and fruit juices to remove the cloudiness; some ice creams, whipped creams, yoghurts, certain butters. \nA number of medicines (from painkillers to multivitamins) also contain pig gelatine; fatty acids extracted from the bone fat of pigs are used in shampoos and conditioners to give them their shiny, pearl-like appearance; glycerine made from pork fat is also an ingredient in many types of toothpaste. \nThere are other products that can include pig material - shoes that use bone glue from pigs to improve the quality of the leather; certain paints that use bone fat to enhance their glossy properties. \nSome manufacturers use an ingredient called L-cysteine, which is a protein made from pig or other animal hair and which is used to soften the dough. \nAccording to the author of ‘Pig 05049’, Christein Meindertsma, some companies didn't even realise their products contained elements taken from a pig because of the middle men involved in the complex distribution process. \nThe confusion is not helped by the fact that it is not clear from the products' ingredient labels where they originally came from. \nSo Nadzim, if you are so particular about products made from pigs or other non-halal ingredients, how can you be ascertained that products that labelled its ingredients as glycerin, gelatine or glue, etc, are not porcine-based? \nI Wonder?: It is better, wiser, easier and practical to label all food and products conforming to ‘halal’ with ‘halal’ logo. \nI wonder whether we should classify our currency notes as non-halal as it is widely circulated and perhaps stained with porcine DNA. \nGE14Now!: And all leaders who are corrupt should have a 'corruption logo' on their sleeves as well. We can also have a 'donation logo' for those who are really good at fundraising. \nWake Up: It is a sad thing that even a 'brush' seemed to be a national issue now. What else to come, no one knows. \nWe failed to realised one truth - whatever we do, wherever we come from and whatever we are we will still living on this earth until we leave. \nWhen we leave, we leave without the physical body and we all become one. It is better to be one now before we realised our foolishness after death. \nMinister puts end to pig bristle brush raids \nFellowMalaysian: Domestic Trade, Cooperatives and Consumerism Minister Hamzah Zainudin has given the most appropriate reply from the government on the seemingly never-ending issue of religion-based agencies and organisations trumpeting up issues on the pretext of defending Islam and the welfare of the Muslim people. \nThe hardware retailers selling pig-bristles paint brushes have every right to sell all kinds of brushes, including those made from pig bristles. Muslims should exercise caution when buying such products. \nEveryone knows that leather products such as shoes, belts or handbags are made from all types of animal hides, including those from pig skin, and these are sold openly in retail outlets big and small. \nMany well-known names and brands of ladies and men's wear of international appeal very often include pigskin in their melange of products in order to meet individual tastes and desires. \nEveryone knows that a little extra pertinence is required when Muslims shop for such products even though they come from exquisite top-notched designer's names. \nDonplaypuks: Hamzah is a rare Umno minister who has the sense and guts to say and do the right thing for once. \nAnonymous_1371477558: We don't have ministers who are willing to do the right thing. Now we have one. Thank you, Hamzah. \nMushiro: For once, we see a minister with common sense to stop the raid. But traders should respond and segregate these products under non-halal section. \nDebater: The problem is that the government, in playing the religious card, had created a class of government servants who had to create work for themselves in order to survive. \nIf they are so religious and wanted to split hair, they should find out whether their income is from halal sources. \nKamikasi: Minister, you are wise. PPIM was the one which went overboard and started this issue. The media did not play this issue. \nWazerman: Judging from Hamzah’s action, he should be complemented for his judgment. However, we cannot say the same for the person who gave instruction for the raid. \nThe above is a selection of comments posted by Malaysiakini subscribers. Only paying subscribers can post comments.
