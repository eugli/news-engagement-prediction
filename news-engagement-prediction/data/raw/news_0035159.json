Its base programming language is Java. However, thanks to several dedicated plug-ins, it can also be utilized to work with other programming and scripting languages, such as C, C++, JavaScript, PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, Ada or COBOL. IDE dedicated to Java developers The IDE targets Java developers who want to create multi-platform software applications for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux distributions and even Solaris. It includes the Eclipse Java development tool made from an incremental Java compiler and a complete set of Java source files that help you analyze code and perform advanced refactoring techniques. Support for numerous platforms and servers Various platforms are provided, such as the Rich Client Platform (RCP) and Server, Web Tools or Modeling components. The RCP consists of Equinox OSGi, the core platform, Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT), JFace, and the Eclipse Workbench for viewing and editing perspectives. Development support is supplied for a plethora of servers, like Tomcat or GlassFish included in the Server platform, while the Web Tools Platform is an extension with the necessary tools to create web and Java EE software products. It contains multiple source and graphic editors for easy development, as well as tools and APIs for everything you need to deploy, run and test your applications. Rich and user-friendly client-oriented tools The Modeling Platform consists of several official project categories of the Eclipse Foundation that set their sights on model-based development technologies. Model Transformation, Model Development Tools, Concrete Syntax Development, Abstract Syntax Development, Technology and Research, together with Amalgam are included. RCP developers are greeted with a set of features that focus on the model-based interface and the CSS-based declarative mechanism needed for putting together a stylish UI. Designing and customizing app interfaces is a flexible job, while the services-oriented programming model helps you run Eclipse platform services discreetly. Overall, a necessary package for Java development In the wide range of of Eclipse-based software tools you can find 2-plan Desktop , Acceleo , Adobe Flash Builder , Aptana , Bioclipse , CityEngine , IBM Lotus Notes , RSSOwl , Talend Open Studio , Xmind , Zen Coding and Zend Studio . All in all, the Eclipse SDK provides a necessary Java IDE with all the right ingredients for developing truly great programs.
