This cohort, who have been found unfit to work, will receive £73.10 a week, in line with Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA) – a reduction of £29.05 on the current rate. \nThe committee said for many new ESA claimants the impact would be compounded because they face higher living costs than JSA claimants, and typically had to get by on benefits for longer. Although ministers promised to provide extra support with living costs, MPs said it was not clear how this would be provided.\nThe committee welcomed the government’s target of getting over a million disabled people into employment by 2025, it warned there were no quick solutions, citing an estimate by the Learning and Work Institute thinktank that on current rates of progress, it would take over 200 years to achieve.\nIt welcomed the government’s intention to reform the much-criticised fit-for-work test known as the work capability assessment. It said it had “for too long been a source of stress and anxiety for disabled people”.\nMinisters should overhaul advice on the use of sanctions, whereby benefit claimants receive financial penalties for apparent breaches of job centre rules, it said. Inappropriate sanctions caused significant hardship, affected individuals’ health, and made a return to work less likely.\n\nA DWP spokesman said: “Our welfare reforms are increasing the support and incentives for people to move into work, while keeping an important safety net in place for those who need it.”\nLiz Sayce, the chief executive of Disability Rights UK, said: “The select committee is right to highlight the forthcoming cuts to employment support allowance as wrong in principle and ineffective in practice. We’re not aware of one single disability employment or benefits expert who thinks this particular cut will be an incentive for disabled people to get a job.”\nMark Atkinson, chief executive at disability charity Scope, said: “We know that reducing disabled people’s incomes won’t incentivise them to find a job and won’t help halve the disability employment gap. It will just make life harder.”\n\nDebbie Abrahams, the shadow work and pensions secretary, described the report as “a clear indictment that the Tories are failing to support disabled people”. \nRob Holland, of learning disability charity Mencap, said: “This report shows yet again that the government has presented no robust evidence that cutting disabled people’s benefits will ‘incentivise’ them to find work. Instead the evidence suggests that this £30-a-week cut will push disabled people further from work, closer to or into poverty as well as affecting their health.”\nThe ESA cut, announced by the former chancellor George Osborne in 2015, came into law last year despite a Lords’ defeat in which peers warned that it would push claimants into poverty.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:30:33.595+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
