So Wired invited the cast of Sesame Street to answer some of the most-searched questions about the show. Specifically Bert, Ernie, Elmo, Big Bird, Oscar The Grouch, The Count, Cookie Monster, Grover, Rosita, and Abby Cadabby are on hand to provide answers and clear up misconceptions. And during the course of the eight-minute video, the inquires range from “How does Sesame Street change the world?” to “How does Sesame Street get celebrities?” to “What species is Big Bird?” to “Is Sesame Street real?” \nThroughout the video, the Sesame Street characters show off their iconic blend of wholesome positivity and winking jokes. For instance, the question of how to get to Sesame Street invokes a mix of metaphorical and practical answers before Cookie Monster finally deadpans, “Uber.” There’s also some genuine trivia mixed in as well.

But really, who needs labels anyway?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:10:15.544+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
