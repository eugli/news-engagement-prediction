Well, about that. \nThe Washington Post ‘s Dave Weigel has a report out today about how liberal activists are cheering on and pressuring Senate Democrats to resist President Trump ‘s nominees, especially where the Supreme Court is concerned. \nSenator Richard Blumenthal said yesterday he will “actively use every legal tool” if Trump picks an “extremist, unqualified nominee”: 3/3 I want to fill open seat, but I will oppose – and will actively use every legal tool to block – an extremist, unqualified nominee. \n— Richard Blumenthal (@SenBlumenthal) January 30, 2017 \nAnd as Weigel reports, Blumenthal went on to say this today: \nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) told reporters Tuesday that he would consider any Trump nominee “based on the merits,” which was hardly as volcanic as the language from the left. But when he clarified what that meant, he opened the door to a four-year filibuster. \n“One of the unfortunate consequences of the Garland obstructionism has been to show that, in fact, the Supreme Court can function with eight members,” Blumenthal said. \nThe only problem with that is this remark from Blumenthal on MSNBC’s Hardball last year in talking about Garland: \n“There’s a duty to fill that vacancy, to make the system work. Our constitutional system depends on nine members serving on the Supreme Court, which is why there has never been a vacancy in the last, I think, 30 years lasting longer than 237 days.” \nAlso, #WeNeedNine: \n— Richard Blumenthal (@SenBlumenthal) September 8, 2016 \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:13:35.544+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
