Three father-son generations of Oldhams, Maury, 90, Rick, 58, and Dan, 31, keep the shop's purpose alive.

He used the public restroom in the hall to freshen up. On weekends, he made trips to do laundry at his parents' house in Rush County. \nFor a few years before he married in 1950, his workspace doubled as a place to live. \nThat rental unit was the humble beginning of Musicians’ Repair and Sales, now located at 322 N. Capitol Ave., in a freestanding white brick building. On the shop’s south-facing exterior, a black-and-white mural depicts the eight “Jazz Masters of Indiana Avenue.” \nThrough high school, Oldham’s 10-piece big band brought proms and community dances to life. Upon graduation, Oldham took his love of music to Butler University. Despite investing two years at the School of Music, his future as a full-time musician was uncertain. An aptitude test ranked Oldham competent in music, art and mechanics. With that in mind, he took a leap of faith to learn to fix instruments at the C.G. Conn repair school in Elkhart. Musicians Repair Service, Inc., as it was called then, was born in Indianapolis in 1948. \nNow 90 years old, Maury, a “master craftsman,” still works in the shop twice a week. Rick Oldham, 58, one of Maury’s five children, is the second-generation owner. \n“I’ve been working here since I was 12,\" Rick said. \"We all worked here at some point. I’m the one who stuck with it. Dan was coming in when he was in elementary school.” \nRick’s son Dan Oldham, 31, is the third generation of Oldhams keeping the tradition alive. Dan is a liaison to outside clients looking to rent, buy or repair instruments. \nThe business works with music programs from the elementary level all the way up to Indiana University’s Marching Hundred. Choir risers, printed sheet music, boxes of reeds, you name it. The shop markets far beyond repairs.

Maury recalled when Woody Herman and his band stopped on their way from Chicago to Louisville in the ‘50s. His grandson Dan more recently remembered when Jeff Coffin of the Dave Matthews Band came by for a repair. \n“We see the guys in the band. We don’t see the stars, unless the star is a jazz guy,” Rick said. \nThe shop runs on one particular objective: To see that people play and continue to make music. \n“Whether that’s a beginner that’s never played and you’ve given them a chance to make their first sound, or whether it’s a guy that’s playing in a smoky jazz club tonight, or a guy that’s playing on a major stage with a major name, it’s all about supporting those people that continue to make music,” Rick said he reminds his staff. “A student in junior high needs an instrument to play just as well as the person that’s playing at the Jazz Kitchen tonight.” \nMany of the shop’s dozen employees learned through mentorship. It takes one to two years of apprenticeship to become familiar with your area of focus, and six to 10 years to be able to fix “just about anything,” according to Rick.

Maury recalled one customer who found a note in his dressing room after a show in Ohio or Pennsylvania. It read, “If you need some good saxophone repair done, see Maury at Musician’s Repair in Indianapolis.” \n“Often I hear from people, ‘Oh, I came in here when I was a kid,’ or ‘My grandpa used to bring me in here because he always came here.’” Rick said. “We hear that a lot because we’ve been around for almost 70 years.” 422 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://indy.st/2kDBs23 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T21:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T14:10:02.423+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
