Citing a conversation he’d had with US national team coach Bruce Arena, who noted that Zusi’s best chance of making the team would be at right back, Vermes said that he endorsed Zusi’s defensive ability, as well as his willingness to play any role that is asked of him. \nSure enough, Arena started Zusi at right back in friendlies against both Serbia and Jamaica at the end of the USMNT's January camp. \nAnd on Saturday, following a 3-0 preseason win over the New York Red Bulls, Vermes spoke to MLSsoccer.com about Zusi’s second appearance of the week at his new position. \n\"[It was] something that we did last year, and we’re probably going to continue to do for however long it continues to serve our purpose,” the SKC coach said. \nVermes went on to praise Zusi’s quality on the ball, which gives him the ability to play almost any position on the field. \n“He can just play.\" \nZusi himself is feeling good about his new role, saying after Saturday’s match, “I’m getting more and more comfortable as we go. Every day is a learning experience for me. I’m getting more comfortable with the back line and the guys in front of me.” \nIt seems that he’s also on the same page with Arena about his national team prospects. \n“As of now, I think this is probably my best opportunity to be in with that team,” Zusi said. “I think that’s the way Bruce is looking at it, and I’ve kind of accepted that, and ... shifted my mentality. And I’m ready to take that on.” \nZusi and Sporting conclude Desert Diamond Cup play on   the regular season on March 4th at D.C.
