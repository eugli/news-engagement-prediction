The project was only announced publicly on February 24, reports RTE. \nIt is the first such project to document the various frescoes since 1994 when camera technology was a far cry from the ultra high definition cameras in use today.

Now, however, photographers have painstakingly captured the majestic works of art on the chapel walls and ceiling like never before. \nPhotographers used a ten-metre-high portable scaffold, special telescopic lenses and state-of-the-art post-production techniques to render the masterpieces in the highest quality possible. \n\"We used special post-production software to get the depth, intensity, warmth and nuance of colors to an accuracy of 99.9%,\" said Giorgio Armaroli, head of the Scripta Maneant publishing house that assisted on the project and helped produce the amazing printed volumes which each weigh a whopping 9kgs (19lbs). \nOf the 870-page collection, 220 pages have been captured in 1:1 scale including the world-famous 'Creation of Adam' from the chapel’s ceiling and Jesus' face from the Last Judgment, which is located behind the altar.
