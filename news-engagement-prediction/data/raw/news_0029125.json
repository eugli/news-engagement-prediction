these also include Coldplay, Juliet Stevenson, Gok Wan, Caroline Flack, Jude Law, Michael Morpurgo, Douglas Booth, Joely Richardson, Lily Allen, Sir Mark Rylance and Ruby Wax.\nJosie Naughton, co-founder of Help Refugees, said: \"The outpouring of support for the continuation of the Dubs scheme by these well-known figures and the public demonstrates that its closure is at odds with the British values that make this country great.\n\"We ask that the Government finds a way to do more to protect these vulnerable children fleeing war and conflict just as we did before the Second World War.\"\nRabbi Janet Darley, of Citizen UK's Safe Passage programme, also welcomed the \"intervention by this broad range of public figures\".\n\"Voices right across society are challenging the Government's decision to close the 'Dubs' and the lifeline it offers to the most vulnerable child refugees because we know it reflects our true national character,\" she said.\n\"Shutting the door on refugee children leaves them with a terrible choice of train tracks on the one hand and people traffickers on the other.\n\"Councils and communities across the country stand ready to do more. We appeal to the Government to live up to our proud history of offering sanctuary to the most vulnerable child refugees.\n\"Britain is better than this.\"\nIn pictures: A day of refugee rescues in the Mediterranean Sea 7 show all In pictures: A day of refugee rescues in the Mediterranean Sea 1/7 A baby being taken on to MSF's Bourbon Argos ship from a boat carrying 130 migrants and refugees\nLizzie Dearden\n2/7 A refugee boat carrying 101 people being rescued by MSF's Bourbon Argos\nLizzie Dearden\n3/7 A refugee boat carrying 101 people being rescued by MSF's Bourbon Argos\nall images by Lizzie Dearden\n4/7 A baby among refugees on a boat carrying 185 people off the coast of Libya\nLizzie Dearden\n5/7 Migrants and refugees sleeping after being rescued by MSF's Bourbon Argos ship\nLizzie Dearden\n6/7 A crew from MSF's Bourbon Argos ship rescuing a boat carrying 130 migrants and refugees off the coast of Libya, at sunrise\nLizzie Dearden\n7/7 A woman in a stretcher being lifted onto MSF's Bourbon Argos ship from a boat carrying 130 migrants and refugees off the coast of Libya\nLizzie Dearden\nOn Saturday, flanked by a group of children, local politicians and faith leaders, Lord Dubs delivered a 50,000-signature petition to the Prime Minister's Downing Street residence, accusing the Government of a \"very shabby cop-out\".\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has also previously said he was \"saddened and shocked\" at the decision.\nHe has insisted it is \"deeply unjust\" to leave the burden of caring for them on Italy and Greece, where thousands of refugees and migrants arrive from the conflict-ridden Middle East and north Africa.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:41:21.409+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
