In a blog post, Google software engineer Jordan Thompson wrote that \"we hope that by playing this Doodle game, you can learn a bit more about these wonderful creatures.\" \nGoogle.org, the charitable arm of Google, also gave a grant to the WWF in 2016 that went towards protecting pangolin habitats from poachers. \nSo what's the game actually like? Keep scrolling... Basically, it's \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" with pangolins. It's pretty fun. You control a pangolin learning to bake, create music, and build flower bouquets to impress its sweetheart. Google On each of the four levels, you roll around at high speeds trying to collect tokens and get to the end before the time runs out. Google In the Google Doodle, pangolins are stylised in dashing purple, pink and yellow colours — but in real life they look like this. 2630ben/Shutterstock Their scales make them highly prized by poachers and animal traffickers. \"There are eight species of pangolin, four each in Asia and Africa, and all are under threat, including two species listed as Critically Endangered,\" the WWF says. \"Pangolin populations have been devastated by poaching, including at least 80 percent of pangolins in Asia.\" A pangolin skin is displayed amongst other exotic and illegal animal parts at a stall on February 17, 2016 in Mong La, Myanmar. Mong La, the capital of Myanmar's Special Region No. 4, is a mostly lawless area where Chinese tourists are able to cross the border for exotic poached animals, gambling, and prostitution.
