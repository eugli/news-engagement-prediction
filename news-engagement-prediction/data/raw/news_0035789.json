Cleveland Cavaliers veterans Richard Jefferson and Channing Frye have their own podcast, and had Kyrie Irving on as a guest during a recent recording while flying between games. During the fifty minute discussion, Channing Frye asks if they think aliens exist. This leads to Kyrie Irving dropping a bombshell: he believes the earth is flat. While all three of them voice a belief that aliens exist, the fact that Kyrie Irving doesn’t think the earth is round is… something. Kyrie is fully convinced too, saying “this is not even a conspiracy theory.” He also makes reference to the mysterious “they” that “lies to us.” We should all be familiar with Flat Earth Truthers after B.o.B ’s high-profile Twitter beef with astrophysicist and public educator Neil DeGrasse Tyson. Irving explains, “if you really think about it from a landscape of the way we travel, the way we move and the fact that, can you really think of us rotation around the sun and all the planets aligned, rotating in specific dates, being perpendicular with what’s going on with these planets.” Uh, yeah, we aren’t sure what that says either. Shout out to Richard Jefferson by calling out Irving. He interjects the question: “How are you going to put ‘Plantes’ in quotations?” We have a feeling this isn’t the last time we hear about this story. Perhaps Irving is just getting really deep into his Uncle Drew character my imitating the symptoms of dementia. Listen to the podcast below. The conspiracy talk starts around the 13-minute mark. < class=\"robots-nocontent\" rel=\"\"> Feb 17, 2017 at 05:59pm 1 View \nA man passed himself as Sisqo making fools of fashionistas at New York Fashion Week.
