The ACLU has your back. We have your back and for the next four years we will not leave you alone, we will not forget you,\" Jenkins said. \nMcCraney said he was glad that \"two boys from Liberty City\" could be up there. \"This goes out to all of those black and brown boys and girls and non-gender-conforming [people] who don't see themselves,\" McCraney said. \"We're trying to show them you and us. ...
