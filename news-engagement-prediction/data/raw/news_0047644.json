Actually it would be more like an elephant with a number of mammoth traits. We're not there yet, but it could happen in a couple of years.\" Ad Feedback \nThe woolly mammoth, which is most closely related to the Asian, rather than African elephant, roamed Europe, Asia, Africa and North America during the last Ice Age and vanished some 4500 years ago, probably due to a climate change and hunting by humans. \n\"De-extinction\" has become a realistic prospect due to revolutionary gene editing techniques that allow precise selection and insertion of DNA taken from specimens found in Siberian ice. \nChurch helped develop the most widely used technique, known as CRISPR/Cas9, that has transformed genetic engineering since it was first demonstrated in 2012. It derives from a defence system bacteria used to fend off viruses and allows precise \"cut and paste\" manipulation of strands of DNA. \nDr Edze Westra, of the University of Exeter, said Church's work \"represents a massive opportunity\", but he added: \"I'm not sure if it is something we should be doing now, but it is definitely something that the technology offers.\" \nSome experts argue that the technology should be used to save animals that are still alive but in decline, rather than trying to bring back extinct creatures. \nDr Beth Shapiro, author of How to Clone a Mammoth , said scientists would never achieve a creature that was \"100 per cent mammoth\". \nShe added: \"Elephants are an endangered species, and what if you could swap out a few genes for mammoth genes, not to bring the mammoth back but to allow them to live in colder climates.\" \nChurch said the mammoth project had two goals; to secure an alternative future for the Asian elephant and to combat global warming. \n\"They keep the tundra from thawing by punching through snow and allowing cold air to come in,\" said Church. \n\"In the summer they knock down trees and help the grass grow.\" \nThe Harvard team intends to engineer elephant skin cells to produce the embryo, or multiple embryos, using cloning techniques. Nuclei from the reprogrammed cells would be placed into elephant egg cells whose own genetic material has been removed. \nThe eggs would then be artificially stimulated to develop into embryos. \nReferring to the artificial womb, Church told the annual American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Boston: \"We hope to do the entire procedure ex-vivo [outside a living body]. It would be unreasonable to put female reproduction at risk in an endangered species. \n\"We're testing the growth of mice ex-vivo. There are experiments in the literature from the 1980s but there hasn't been much interest for a while. \n\"Today, we've got a whole new set of technology and we're taking a fresh look at it,\" Church said. \nHe predicted that age reversal will become a reality within 10 years as a result of developments in genetic engineering.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T02:26:03.941+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
