The studio is now called Ghost Story, and it was formed by a dozen former members of Irrational, including controversial co-founder Ken Levine , who will serve as president and creative director of the new venture.\n“Our mission is simple: to create immersive, story-driven games for people who love games that ask something of them,” the studio explains on its site. “While we believe our new games will have strong appeal to fans of BioShock , our new focus allows us to craft experiences where the gameplay is as challenging as the stories.” Ghost Story hasn’t announced yet what it’s first project will be. As with Irrational, the new studio exists under the umbrella of publisher Take-Two Interactive.\nThe studio formerly known as Irrational Games is now called “Ghost Story”.

He described the process as “narrative Lego,” and explained that it would include a large focus on involving the community. \"I think right now audiences want to be part of [development],” he said. “They want to play alphas. They want to be giving their feedback along the way.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:13:50.183+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
