It is historical distortion taken from a \"novel\" from the cold war era and transposed into a TV series in the new cold war era ranking with russophobia. It puts on the same level Nazifascism and the Soviet Union, who instead was the one nation that fought it most of anyone else and defeated it by cost of an unprecedented human sacrifice. This rubbish proposes pseudo-history about a historical situation that costed tens of millions of soviet lives who fought against the annihilation and enslavement planned by Germany, who in the previous years had been appeased mostly by the UK, who also favored the German expansion towards east (i.e. Munic Pact, for instance), not to mention the \"neutrality\" during the Spanish civil war, or the British elites sympathy for Nazism and Hitler. So who's the one who is to be paired to Nazism? Offensive, insulting, intellectually dishonest rubbish, 1 of 4 people found this review helpful. Was this review helpful to you?
