All they said was, ‘Be silent, be silent, be silent.’ ”\nAdvertisement\nTeenagers sitting in the pews, seven of whom were individually recognized later in the service for their accomplishments, said they heard Warren’s message: Don’t be silent.\nEmma DiMarino, a senior at St. Joseph Preparatory High School in Boston who takes all honors and advanced placement courses, said she wants to become an attorney or do other political advocacy work.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Kevin Coakley.\nBoston City Council President Michelle Wu, who tweeted criticism of the decision to prevent Warren from reading King’s letter, accompanied Warren to the service.\nFollowing Warren’s remarks, Stephen Whalen, managing partner at City Realty Group in Brookline, and Coakley spoke to the congregation about seven of its high school seniors: DiMarino and Young, along with Cornelius “Neil” Prioleau of Boston Latin Academy; Aaron Shariff of Boston Latin School, Timothy Riddick of Fenway High School, Makeyla Hayes of Boston Trinity Academy, and Malik Bailey of Milton High School.\nIn connection with the real estate firm’s City Kids nonprofit, which aims to expand educational opportunities for children of City Realty Group tenants, the seven students were each given donated laptop computers. The group was then given a $5,000 scholarship, to be divided among the students, by the William C. Dukes trust.\nThe students said they have grown up together as members of the church and that it felt wonderful to be recognized for their educational and community achievements.\n“Everybody in my community expects a lot of me, so I want to be able to make everybody proud,” said Riddick, 17, of Dorchester. The young entrepreneur co-owns a sneaker customization and restoration business.\nHayes, a 17-year-0ld competitive swimmer from Hyde Park who wants to become a bilingual child psychologist, said the current state of civil rights feels like a step backward. But hearing Warren speak to her and her childhood friends at their church, she is still hopeful.\n“Working together as a community, we can all promote a change in the end,” said Hayes.\nNicole Fleming can be reached at nicole.fleming@globe.com .", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2017%2F02%2F12%2Fteens-roxbury-church-hear-warren-message-don-silent%2FbAkFtEhBmocc9cA6cI7otN%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&title=In", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=In", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2017%2F02%2F12%2Fteens-roxbury-church-hear-warren-message-don-silent%2FbAkFtEhBmocc9cA6cI7otN%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&t=In", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2017%2F02%2F12%2Fteens-roxbury-church-hear-warren-message-don-silent%2FbAkFtEhBmocc9cA6cI7otN%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%3Fevent%3Devent25&tIn", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2017%2F02%2F12%2Fteens-roxbury-church-hear-warren-message-don-silent%2FbAkFtEhBmocc9cA6cI7otN%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%26s_campaign%3dsm_gp%26hl=en-US"], "published": "2017-02-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T09:39:20.299+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
