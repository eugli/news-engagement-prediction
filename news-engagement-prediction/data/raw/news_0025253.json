Sasikala's conviction in the disproportionate assets (DA) case was upheld by a Supreme Court bench this morning, nixing any possibility of her becoming Tamil Nadu chief minister. The verdict disqualified Sasikala from becoming a legislator, which consequentially meant she can't be chief minister either. \n\n2. She was set to be taken into immediate custody for serving out the remaining four years of her sentence from her earlier conviction in the DA case. She had been sentenced to 10 years in jail and has already served a little over six years. \n\n3. However, with no special court judge to accept her surrender, Sasikala wasn't immediately arrested and she got a breather for a few hours. \n\n4. Advocate General Madhusudhan Nail met the chief justice of Karnataka - where the initial verdict was given - asking him to notify a judge today so Sasikala can be taken into judicial custody. \n\n5. All this while, Sasikala was camped with AIADMK lawmakers in a resort outside Chennai where they were corralled. \n\n6. The SC's decision was seen as giving a big boost to O Panneerselvam who was named caretaker chief minister of Tamil Nadu following the death of AIADMK supreme Jayalalithaa. But that was not to be. \n\n7. Soon after the SC's decision, Sasikala went into a huddle with dozens of her party's MLAs who claimed to support her earlier bid to become chief minister and 'legitimate' heir to Jayalalithaa. \n\n8. About two hours after the SC decision, Sasikala sacked Panneerselvam from primary membership of the AIADMK and announced that Edappadi K Palaniswami is the chief ministerial candidate for Tamil Nadu. She also announced that Palaniswami has been elected AIADMK legislature party leader. \n\n9. As Palaniswami readied to meet the Tamil Nadu governor C Vidyasagar Rao stake his claim to form government, he said a letter of support from legislators has been forwarded to Rao. \"We are awaiting word from the governor,\" Palaniswami said. \n\n10. In the meanwhile, Panneerselvam set out for the resort outside Chennai to meet with the party's lawmakers who have been camping there for days now. The caretaker CM also urged party unity. \"Let us stay united. Rivals are trying to split the party,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T20:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T10:20:57.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
