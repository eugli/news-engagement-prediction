In most areas 4-6 ft snowbanks will need to be removed. #HfxSnow pic.twitter.com/2on1WVDctZ\n— @hfxgov", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hfxgov/status/831294934514819077", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/HfxSnow?src=hash", "https://t.co/2on1WVDctZ"], "published": "2017-02-14T02:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:29:14.505+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
