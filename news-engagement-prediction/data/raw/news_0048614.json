Ten-man ­Millwall possessed plenty of spirit as they piled more misery on the struggling champions with this famous win.\nMillwall striker Steve ­Morison’s story only backed up that view.\nAccording to Morison, Chilwell struggled to deal with the crowd (Photo: Leicester City FC via Getty Images) Read More Millwall 1-0 Leicester: Shaun Cummings strike helps 10-man Lions down Foxes Leicester were fearless as they defied the odds to win the title 12 months ago. At Millwall, Chilwell was too afraid to even take a throw-in.\nMorison said: “The left-back started taking throw-ins and after a couple of bits of verbal he didn’t want to. He asked the centre-half to take the throw-ins first half.\n“I’m not being funny. He said his fingers hurt him – come on, we’re playing a game of football.\n“You either sink or swim when you come here. So far three teams have come here and they have sunk.”\nAnother scalp for the Lions (Photo: 2017 Getty Images) Leicester joined ­ Bournemouth and Watford in seeing their FA Cup hopes turn to dust at the Den this season.\nAnd it is easy to see why the famous ground their fans fought so hard to save from a compulsory purchase order is prime upset territory.\nThe bobbly pitch, described as a “park” by Morison, is a mile away from the Premier League’s pristine surfaces.\nThe Den was rocking and the intimidating atmosphere would test the mettle of many a player, with both fans and Millwall players right in your face. “The atmosphere was fantastic, wasn’t it?” Morison said.\nLions players celebrate their victory (Photo: Plumb Images) Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Watch this video again Video will play in Millwall fans celebrate win from OUTSIDE the ground Share this video Watch Next “We spoke about it before, we wanted to be hostile. We were hostile on the pitch.\n“We weren’t knocking someone over and asking if they’re OK and picking them up, we’re here to win a ­football game.\n“Players come to us down here, if they don’t want to have the physical battle they’re going to come unstuck because it's what we do week-in-week-out and I love it. I think it’s great.”\nLeicester were handed the initiative when Millwall defender Jake Cooper was dismissed on 52 minutes.\nBut instead it was the hosts who puffed out their chests, grew in stature and showed their spirit.\nAnd they were rewarded at the death when right-back Shaun Cummings kept his cool amid the frenzy to fire Millwall through. Morison wasn’t surprised by Cummings’ composure.\nCummings 90th minute winner put Millwall into the last eight (Photo: Clive Rose) “Shauny’s the calmest man in the world,” he said. “You’d forget he’s there sometimes.\n“He comes in, does his thing goes home.”\nThe prospect of a Wembley semi-final would get laid-back Cummings excited though. “Of course!” he said. “I have been there a good few times but never played, so it would be nice to go to Wembley and actually play a game there.”\nMillwall were also indebted to goalkeeper Jordan Archer for three top saves to deny Shinji Okazaki.\nMillwall had all the answers to the Foxes' attacking efforts (Photo: Leicester City FC via Getty Images) Lions boss Neil Harris said: “When we needed him to come up with big moments here he did.”\nHarris also took some ­inspiration from the Cowley brothers who led non-league Lincoln to the other big giant-killing of the day at Burnley.\nHe said: “Danny and Nicky are very good friends of mine. They were PE teachers at my son’s school and I’m delighted Lincoln managed to get through – that is the real big story of the round, not us.\n“They were very popular with the pupils at my son’s school. Well, they are PE teachers aren’t they? It’s not real teaching is it!”\npoll loading Will Leicester be relegated? 5000+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO Football Newsletter Follow @mirrorfootball Subscribe to our Football Claudio Ranieri Neil Harris Premier League FA Cup Leicester City FC Millwall FC Ben Chilwell", "external_links": ["https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/trinity-images/logos/mirror.png", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/2023/4221396001_5328323483001_5328210758001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=mirrorfootball", "https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball"], "published": "2017-02-20T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T00:32:59.343+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
