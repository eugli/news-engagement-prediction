SENATE CHAMBER \n“From tomorrow, various committees are expected to start submitting reports to the Committee on Appropriations based on schedule earlier provided as a result of the conclusion of budget defence by MDAs.” \nSenate charges education MDAs on higher performance \nThe Senate also lamented what it described as unimpressive performance of capital projects by the Ministry, Departments and Agencies, MDAs, in the education sector in 2016, and attributed it to late release of funds and bottleneck in the budget due process. \nSpeaking during a meeting with representatives of Education MDAs on how to promote education in Nigeria beginning from 2017 at the weekend, Chairman, Senate Committee on Education (Basic and Secondary), Senator Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko, said it was time Nigeria developed different, immediate strategies to rescue the education sector in Nigeria. \nWamakko, who noted that timely delivery of capital projects in the sector with adequate funding would help address the problem, said government was determined to set the tone for improved education in Nigeria, stressing that this explained why the government increased the allocation of the sector in the 2017 budget by 10.05 per cent. \nBlasts agencies of govt over poor IGR \nMeanwhile, the Senate has queried the poor revenue generational capacity of government parastatals and agencies, especially in the culture and entertainment industry. \nAt the budget defence session with the heads of agencies and parastatals in the Culture sector of the Ministry of Information and Culture, Senate Committee on Culture and Tourism declared that it was unfortunate that these agencies had failed to look inward and raise money, while only requesting money from the government every year. \nChairman, Senate Committee on Culture and Tourism, Senator Matthew Urhoghide, noted that the budget should not only be about expenditure, but also about revenue profile, adding that these agencies had the potentialities increase their IGR drive, if necessary instruments were put in place.
