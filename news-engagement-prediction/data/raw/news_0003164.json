Jerry Thornton | Email \nSmoking Gun – On the eve of Tom Brady’s seventh appearance in the Super Bowl, the quarterback’s biggest fan is a wanted man. \nVictor Thompson, 48, is named in four separate arrest warrants, according to Florida court records. Three of the warrants are for felony narcotics possession cases, while the fourth warrant is for Thompson’s failure to appear in court on another drug case. \nThe warrants, all issued in mid- to late-2015, accuse Thompson of possessing spice, the synthetic hallucinogen. In each case, Thompson was found carrying the drug by St. Petersburg Police Department officers. One court affidavit charges that Thompson “was using and selling narcotics” outside a homeless shelter. \nSo typical. Even on the verge of perhaps the Patriots finest hour, the world can’t stop persecuting Pats fans. Not even a beautiful soul like Victor Thompson. \nThe last I looked, spice was legal. Hell, you can buy it in gas stations. Not that you should, necessarily. It’s also legal to swallow a mouthful of Drano – and it would probably be better for you – but that doesn’t mean I’d recommend it. But since when it is a crime to sell the stuff? Particularly to homeless people, who could probably use the boost. Again, I’m not a big spice guy, but I’m pretty small “l” libertarian. So I don’t want to live in a country where the Chandler Joneses get to take synthetic hallucinogens and go wandering shirtless into the police station but a sweet guy like Victor Thompson gets arrested. \nSo with any luck, he’ll be able to evade capture. Blend into the crowd, Dr. Richard Kimball-style. If he can, if he can somehow make his way up to Massachusetts, he’s welcome to come watch the game with me at Stately Thornton Manor over beers and Tex-Mex. I can’t put my finger on it, but omething about these pictures tells me we’d be instant best friends. \nFree Victor Thompson! Free Victor Thompson!
