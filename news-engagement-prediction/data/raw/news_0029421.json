Photo: Andrew Meares \nA December report by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) concluded the overall mix of energy sources such as wind and solar had added to the complexity and therefore potentially, to the vulnerability of the supply during extreme conditions. \n\"The growing proportion of this type of generating plant within the generation portfolio is leading to more periods with low inertia and low available fault levels, hence a lower resilience to extreme events,\" the regulator stated. \nAs the political argument over climate change and household electricity prices intensified, Mr Turnbull attempted to turn a question from Opposition leader Bill Shorten into an assault on Labor's policy. \n\"There they are, the legions of the Labor loyalists, they are on their way to the light on the hill through the darkness of the night, the light is there. It is still, there is not a sound, but then you hear softly at first, and then louder and louder, the chug, chug, chug, of the back-up generator, because that is what you need to power the light on the hill or anywhere in South Australia nowadays,\" he said, to the delight of government MPs. \nWithin minutes of that counter-attack, the lights went out briefly in Parliament House, including in the Senate chamber, while Attorney-General George Brandis was on his feet. \n\"Another Labor administration in the (Australian Capital) Territory, can't keep the lights on,\" quipped the senator as he glanced skyward. \nBut while Mr Turnbull and other ministers fervently denied previously tagging renewables as a cause of South Australia's blackouts, he appeared to drop that pretence in light of the AEMO findings. \n\"It is perfectly obvious that what was done was mindless, negligent and incompetent,\" he said. \n\"The reality is that they put all of their bets on renewable energy and failed to recognise it has certain consequences.\" \nFollow us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T14:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T09:24:16.145+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
