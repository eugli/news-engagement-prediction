(Well, normal for Japan.) As reported by Tokyo Bargain Mania ( via Kotaku ), there’s a Tuna-style Maguro Kit Kat, which actually tastes like raspberry and sits on a bed of puffed rice: (Photo: Tokyo Bargain Mania) \nThere’s a sea-urchin-inspired Uni Kit Kat, which tastes like melon and mascarpone and is wrapped in seaweed: (Photo: Tokyo Bargain Mania) \nAnd there’s an egg-based Tamago Kit Kat that tastes like pumpkin pudding and features both puffed rice and seaweed: (Photo: Tokyo Bargain Mania) \nThe set of sushi Kit Kats costs around $26, but even if you have a few thousand yen burning a hole in your pocket and you happen to be in Tokyo, you’ll only have until February 4 to get some. After that, they’ll all be scattered to the far corners of the Earth like the Dragon Balls, only to return when a great hero needs Kit Kat sushi to save the universe. \n[Note: Kotaku , like The A.V.
