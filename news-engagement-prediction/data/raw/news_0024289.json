That forced the appalled families to attempt to bring a private prosecution. People lay floral tributes at the scene of IRA Hyde Park bombing, 1982. The families will not be able to use public funds for a private prosecution Sefton, the horse injured in the IRA Hyde Park bombing, became a national hero after seven horses died In March last year, the director of the Legal Aid Agency, Shaun McNally, dealt them a blow by ruling out funding their case against Downey – claiming it was ‘not in the public interest’. Last October a High Court judge ordered a review of that decision, arguing that putting the alleged killer on trial could be a ‘real benefit to the general public’. But now the agency has rejected stumping up the cash, despite admitting the case had ‘significant’ wider public interest. It said the costs of funding the families’ case was ‘not proportionate to the benefits’ – effectively a waste of money. Mark Tipper, the brother of Trooper Tipper, said: ‘This just causes further pain. The man we want to stand in court and answer for his actions was set free because of mistakes by our Government departments. The fact that another Government agency won’t pick up the baton is another slap in the face to all of us.’ HOW OMAGH BOMBING VICTIMS WERE BETRAYED TOO... UNTIL THE MAIL STEPPED IN Families of the Omagh bombing victims were told they would not qualify for legal aid to launch a successful civil action against four Real IRA terrorists. The blast in August 1998 was the biggest single act of bloodshed during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The death toll was 29 including a woman pregnant with twins. When the criminal justice system had failed to bring the killers to justice two years after the atrocity, the families approached the Mail for help. Readers responded magnificently to this newspaper’s appeal, helping raise £1.2million towards the landmark case for damages. Days before the fifth anniversary of the attack, the Government agreed to find the extra £800,000 needed to bring the action to court. In 2009 a Belfast judge ruled that convicted IRA leader Michael McKevitt, Liam Campbell, Seamus Daly and Colm Murphy were behind the atrocity. They were ordered to pay £1.6million in damages to relatives of the victims – although the relatives are still pursuing the compensation. Downey, from Donegal, was due to stand trial at the Old Bailey, but the convicted IRA terrorist was told he would not face prosecution when he mistakenly received a letter saying he was not wanted Downey, from Donegal, was due to stand trial at the Old Bailey, but the convicted IRA terrorist was told he would not face prosecution because he mistakenly received a ‘comfort letter’ – nicknamed a ‘get out of jail free card’ – sent to 187 on-the-run paramilitary suspects saying they were not wanted by police. The letters were issued after a secret deal between members of Tony Blair’s government and IRA leaders under the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. The £317,000 needed to fund a private prosecution is a drop in the ocean compared with the millions the Police Service of Northern Ireland is spending on a ‘witch-hunt’ by investigating up to 1,000 ex-soldiers, now in their 60s and 70s, as part of a re-examination of every British Army killing during the Troubles. Matthew Jury, of law firm McCue and Partners, which represents the families, said: ‘The state is willing to spend millions to investigate and prosecute UK veterans – many for actions they took combating terrorism. ‘Yet, when it comes to the murder of four British soldiers, the Legal Aid Agency’s position is that there isn’t enough public benefit to warrant the cost of bringing their alleged killer to trial. This begs the question, when it comes to justice, is a soldier’s life worth less?’ Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T07:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T02:52:59.150+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
