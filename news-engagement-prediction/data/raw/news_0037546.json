The Denver Broncos were not far behind.\nTony Romo Next Year:\nTexans +180\nBroncos 3/1\nCowboys 6/1\nBears 7/1\nChiefs 8/1\n49ers 10/1\nBills 25/1\nAny Other Team 3/1\n[via sportsbook.ag]\n— RJ Bell (@RJinVegas) February 17, 2017\nRomo reportedly feels he can play another two or three seasons, and his teammates said he was incredibly sharp in practice after returning from his latest back injury. The 37-year-old’s current contract pays him an average of $18 million per season through 2019, and it seems unlikely that he will restructure that or take less money if the Cowboys release him and he signs somewhere as a free agent.\nOsweiler, who was arguably the worst quarterback in the NFL this year, carries a salary cap hit of $19 million in 2017. Paying a backup that kind of money is never a recipe for success, and it’s highly unlikely that Houston will find a trade partner for him.\nRomo wants to play for a contender, and the Texans are reportedly one of four teams on his wish list . If he thinks Houston gives him the best chance to win, he may be willing to get creative with his contract.\nPointAfter | Graphiq\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "https://twitter.com/RJinVegas/status/832407731055104000", "https://w.graphiq.com/w/4sJBcn0IsXH?data-uid=7d00c4a52b&data-campaign=60590aafb5&data-pub=", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;DomainId&quot;:", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Romo", "http://larrybrownsports.com/football/tony-romo-wishlist/348743", "http://c.120sportsstatic.com/gen/client/rss/ms_timeline.xml&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;externalPlayerName&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;120Sports&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;externalPlayerUri&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://secure.ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;}", "https://football-players.pointafter.com/l/17700/Tony-Romo", "https://secure.ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAn3fhT.img&quot;}}"], "published": "2017-02-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T05:26:02.665+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
