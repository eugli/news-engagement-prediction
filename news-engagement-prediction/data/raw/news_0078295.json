While at Vanity Fair's Oscars after-party on Sunday night at the Wallis Annenberg Center in Beverly Hills, California, Damon spoke exclusively to ET's Carly Steel about what he thought of Kimmel hosting the awards ceremony, which ultimately ended with a major flub when La La Land was accidentally declared Best Picture instead of the actual winner, Moonlight.

You know, they got what they paid for.\" Even before the Oscars, Kimmel was cracking jokes at Damon's expense. On Friday, he posted a photo of himself drawing a mustache on the Good Will Hunting star's seating card, along with the caption: \"Best Picture Vominee Matt Damon.\" Then, while Damon was being interviewed on the Oscars red carpet, Kimmel shared a photo of himself watching his nemesis on TV, writing: \"Dead man walking the red carpet.\" There was, however, a moment in Kimmel's opening Oscars monologue where he implied that he might be ready to make amends with Damon -- but that turned out to be insincere.

I would. Matt Damon,\" the 49-year-old comedian began. \"I've known Matt for a long time now. I've known Matt so long, when I first met Matt, I was the fat one, OK? It's true. And we've had problems. He's a selfish person. Those of you who have worked with him know this.\" Kimmel went on to sarcastically praise Damon for giving Casey Affleck his Oscar-winning role in Manchester by the Sea , which Damon produced. \"He handed an Oscar-caliber role over to his friend and made a Chinese ponytail movie instead,\" he said of the actor's Great Wall movie. \"Smooth move, dumb a**.\" WATCH: Jimmy Kimmel Jokes That He's Behind the Oscars Best Picture Mix-Up The host's next Damon diss came when the A-lister took the stage with his pal, Ben Affleck, to present the award for best original screenplay, which went to Kenneth Lonergan for Manchester by the Sea. Every time Damon attempted to read off the nominees, the orchestra music started to play loudly. Cameras then cut to Kimmel conducting the orchestra, while yelling, \"Wrap it up!\" Kimmel managed to get one more dig in before the Oscars ended, when he declared ahead of the major Best Picture flub, \"My favorite part of the night is here: a chance to see Matt Damon lose an Academy Award.\" However, a supermodel may have brought the two together at the VF after-party. Adriana Lima shared a photo of herself standing between the two men on Sunday night, writing: \"Peacemaker Angel... Can't we all just get along?\" Here's a look at more memorable moments from the evening: Related Articles ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:16:27.593+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
