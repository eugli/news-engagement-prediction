The get-in-get-out space near USC has proven popular enough to warrant a few new locations in Downtown, Baldwin Hills, and even Santa Monica. The Everytable model is actually built on such expansions. Since first arriving back in July of last year, the company has promised to grow into a number of outlets as a way to spread overhead costs and work out its new, unique business model. Basically, the company, which offers pre-prepared healthy-eating grain bowls and salads, offers lower meal costs in lower-income neighborhoods like South LA while charging higher (but still affordable) prices for the same product in more affluent areas of the city. So the same $5 bowl at Everytable off W. 23rd Street might retail for $8 in Downtown or Santa Monica, depending on the demographics in their particular areas. That’s also the reason that Everytable prioritizes a diversity of neighborhoods when expan ding. The first-up location is Baldwin Hills, inside the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Mall on MLK Boulevard. That opening is coming this Saturday, with the third iteration landing at Downtown’s The Bloc development later in March. Santa Monica will open along the Third Street Promenade after that, with the lowest priced meal for Baldwin Hills clocking in at $4, and around $8 per meal for Downtown and Santa Monica. Chef Jessica Spear is now leading the culinary development behind the pre-made meals, which are constructed at a commissary kitchen in Los Angeles. Co-owners Sam Polk and David Foster are planning an opening party in Baldwin Hills on Saturday, and with the high foot traffic to be found along Third Street Promenade and at The Bloc, the offering of an inexpensive, healthy meal should be reason enough to stop in.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T04:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:12:49.875+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
