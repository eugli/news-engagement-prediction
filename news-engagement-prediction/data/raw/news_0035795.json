February 17, 2017 - 3:03 pm @emilyctamkin \nMonday marks exactly one month since U.S. President Donald Trump took office. Can you believe it? It’s already been a month! Time flies. \nIn honor of the occasion, we’ve put together this quiz composed of some comments world leaders did not say during Trump’s first month, and some they very much did. Can you tell which is which? There is truly only one way to find out: \n\nJean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission \n“I am very much against letting ourselves be pushed into this. I don’t like our American friends narrowing down this concept of security to the military … If you look at what Europe is doing in defense, plus development aid, plus humanitarian aid, the comparison with the United States looks rather different.” \n\nVicente Fox, former president of Mexico \n“You know what’s really fake, Donald Trump? Everything you say! The world isn’t like you envision it, please look above your fucking wall.” \n\nMikheil Janelidze, minister of foreign affairs of Georgia \n“Georgia is USA’s strong partner and an ally in the region.” \n\nJustin Trudeau, prime minister of Canada \n“The last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern.” \n\nShinzo Abe, prime minister of Japan \n“I think Trump shared the view that our monetary policy is not for currency manipulation but for ending deflation.” \n\nJiri Ovcacek, spokesperson for Milos Zeman, president of the Czech Republic \n“U.S. President Trump protects his country, he’s concerned with the safety of his citizens. Exactly what EU elites do not do.” \n\nTheresa May, prime minister of the United Kingdom \n“I’ve been listening to the president, and the president has been listening to me.” \n\nVladimir Putin, president of Russia \n“I don’t know Mr. Trump, I have never met him. I don’t know what he will do in the international arena, so I have no reason either to attack him, criticize him or defend him.” \n\nMalcolm Turnbull, prime minister of Australia \n“A very great politician, Winston Churchill, once said that politicians complaining about the newspapers is like a sailor complaining about the sea.” \n\nAngela Merkel, chancellor of Germany \n“Why is this happening to me?” \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T00:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T18:12:34.048+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
