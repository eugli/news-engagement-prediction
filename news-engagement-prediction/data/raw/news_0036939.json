The partnership seeks to bring the expertise of the Pantone Color Institute to the design and craftsmanship that can be found in Huawei’s devices. Huawei already tends to launch most of their products with a range of different color options , many of them looking very stylish, but this new partnership seems to be aiming to up the ante a little bit by introducing consumers to a color spread for mobile device products that are more well thought out. \nAccording to Huawei , partnering up with the Pantone Color Institute will enable them to launch devices that marry “groundbreaking innovation together with stunning beauty.” That may not be an understatement, as Huawei’s devices are generally groundbreaking in certain areas and they usually have a very sleek design, but with a set of trendy colors fixed to the outside of the device it might just get more consumers interested. Where some consumers tend to look for devices which focus on function over form, many consumers might prefer a device that simply looks good, and some might prefer a combination of the two, and that seems to be the direction that Huawei and Pantone are following. \nWhile there’s no way to know at the moment what sorts of colors consumers might see on future Huawei products, the Pantone Color Institute is an expert in color and it’s stated that color can influence human emotion through a variety of factors such as social commentary, seasonal trend forecasts, and custom color creation. With that said it’s possible that consumers will start to see Huawei products with colors that are based on some of this criteria. In addition to today’s announcement about the partnership, Huawei states that they will have more details to share about their collaboration with the Pantone Color Institute at Mobile World Congress during their press conference on February 26th. For those who view design as a big part of the decision when looking at a new device, Huawei is poised to be offering exciting and expressive new color options for their products that allow consumers to pick a device which fits their personality and tastes.
