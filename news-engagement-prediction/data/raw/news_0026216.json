Judging from these spy shots of the 2019 Bentley Continental GT , Bentley saw the 996 and demanded MORE SOUP. \nI don’t personally hate the 996 runny ovum face. It’s fine. Whatever. This Bentley though, uh, sheesh, wow. This is just a spy shot though! It’s still got a bunch of cladding on it. From the rear it kinda looks like the Bentley EXP 10 Speed 6 concept from a few years back, though supposedly Bentley is still working on making that a separate production car.

Underneath it’s basic architecture makes it out to be a Porsche Panamera coupe, just like that modern-day Porsche 928 you always wanted .
