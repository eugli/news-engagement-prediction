It has so far sent to the Crown Prosecution Service possible charges of gross negligence manslaughter, perverting the course of justice, misconduct in public office and offences for breaches of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 and health and safety laws.\nNuttall insisted he would not resign if he lost the Stoke Central byelection on Thursday. He is fighting Labour’s Gareth Snell for the seat, which Labour holds by a majority of 5,179, but his campaign has been dogged by the controversy over his Hillsborough comments. \nThe Ukip donor Arron Banks also added fuel to the row over Hillsborough by saying he was “sick to death” of hearing about the disaster. Over the weekend, two Ukip chairmen in Merseyside resigned in protest at the “crass insensitivity” of the party’s handling of the controversy.\nNuttall said he wanted to put his comments “in perspective”, insisting he had been present at the disaster, despite surprise expressed by a former schoolmate and teacher that he had been present, in comments to the Guardian. \nOne of his former teachers, a Roman Catholic priest , told the Guardian that the school believed it had been aware of the identities of every boy who had been at Hillsborough, in order to help them through a difficult period, but Nuttall was not among them.\nNuttall, who admitted on Liverpool’s Radio City Talk that he did not lose “close personal friends”, contrary to quotes in his name on his website, said the mistake “wasn’t crass, maybe Arron Banks was but I made a genuine error”.\n“Of course I’ll apologise to the people of Liverpool , I’ll apologise to everyone for not checking what went up on my website. It’s my fault,” he said. “I haven’t spoken to him. Arron Banks isn’t a member of Ukip so I can’t kick him out of an organisation he isn’t a member of. But I have publicly condemned it. He’s not a member, he has given money in the past.”\nNuttall said he would not resign if his campaign foundered in Stoke. “It will only be 12 weeks into my leadership at the end of this byelection. What we have got here is a long-term project going forward,” he said.\nSnell has also suffered some embarrassment during the campaign after offensive Twitter comments about guests on the TV programme Loose Women were unearthed, as well as criticism of the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, as an “IRA-supporting friend of Hamas”.\nAt the Radio 5 Live hustings, Snell also said he wanted to apologise again. “I have apologised to my wife and my grandmother and my daughter because those aren’t words I would like them to have to face,” he said. “So if I can take the opportunity to apologise, I will do.”\nSnell said his criticism of Corbyn was because of a “very fractious summer in our party” when Owen Smith challenged Corbyn for the leadership. “We spent a lot of time arguing amongst ourselves,” he said. “Things got very heated and things were said. The comments that I made were to point out that we were getting to a point of hyperbole in our party that was damaging us publicly.\n“But since then I’ve met with Jeremy. He’s been to the constituency three times. He’s been campaigning with us. He’s been on the doorstep. And every time he spoke to somebody, they’ve been glad to talk to him.”\nPaul Nuttall UK Independence party (Ukip) Byelections Hillsborough disaster Liverpool news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:55:23.602+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
