He’s reportedly dropping another LP this Friday (February 24) — a week after FUTURE , according to Hits Daily Double . \nThe reasoning for releasing two projects in such a short time, the site says, is that the Atlanta rapper and his label, Freebandz on Epic Records, want to have back-to-back #1 albums on the Billboard 200. FUTURE is already projected to top the chart when the Nielson numbers are released Monday (February 27) with up to 155,000 equivalent album units. \nThe new album is supposedly “more Rhythmic-leaning and radio-friendly” than the self-titled release. Future didn’t have any lead singles for FUTURE, but did release the video for “ Super Trapper ” yesterday. \nOther Hip Hop projects to top Billboard’s 200 — Big Sean’s I Decided . and Migos’ Culture — each debuted at the #1 slot and were bumped down in the next sales cycle. \nHipHopDX reached out to Epic Records to confirm the new Future album but had not heard back at the time of publication.
