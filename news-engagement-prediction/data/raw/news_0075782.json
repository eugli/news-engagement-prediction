They're really un-American. \n\"I know this feels preachy and boring and I'm preaching to the choir but I'm just lending my little voice to the chorus here.\" Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Naomie Harris: \"It's going to be a very political year this year at the Oscars\" \nBritish actress Naomie Harris, who appears in Moonlight, said the current political climate is \"definitely going to be reflected\" at the Oscars. \n\"Really great art reflects society,\" she told BBC News. \"It also edifies us. It shows us a different way of operating. So I definitely think it's going to be a very political year this year at the Oscars.\" \nShe also said Moonlight has struck a chord because it has fed \"our universal yearning for connection\". \nShe said: \"We're all yearning to connect, and I think in a society where we have so much technology that makes us feel as though we're connected, but it's not really about true connection. It's not heartfelt connection. \n\"And that's what we're all longing for, and I think that, in Moonlight, is what's demonstrated.\" \nThe Independent Spirits ceremony is the traditional precursor to the Oscars and is one of the awards season's more informal events. It honours films made for less than $20m (Â£16m). \nFollow us on Facebook , on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts , or on Instagram at bbcnewsents . If you have a story suggestion email .
