Chrystia Freeland, fresh off a blitz of meetings in the U.S. capital with counterpart Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and other Washington power brokers, said there are no firm American proposals and many “divergent” views in D.C. on a potential renegotiation of the North American free trade deal and on a possible border tax on imports to the U.S. \nPresident Donald Trump has vowed both.\nBut in a conference call with reporters, Freeland said she delivered a forceful defence of Canadian trade and economic interests. \n“Canada will have no position on the tax reform plan or the border adjustment tax idea until it is fully formed and is a concrete proposal,” she said. “But I did make clear that we would be strongly opposed to any imposition of new tariffs between Canada and the United States; that we felt tariffs on exports would be mutually harmful to both Canada and the United States, and if such an idea were ever to come into being Canada would respond appropriately.”\n  Freeland did not say if that means matching U.S. action on the Canadian side with a tariff or non-tariff barrier, or by making a complaint under NAFTA or to the World Trade Organization. \nHer parliamentary secretary on Canada-U.S. affairs, Andrew Leslie, would not clarify further. “We’re there to ensure our economic interests are protected and we’ll defend those fiercely . . . until the actual negotiations start we’re not in a position to say what we will or won’t do.”\nFreeland would not put her “cards on the table” publicly in advance of any possible move by the U.S. to reopen the NAFTA. \nStill, she said in all her meetings — with Tillerson and senior Republican congressional leaders like Speaker Paul Ryan, Sen. John McCain, and senators Bob Corker and Ben Cardin — the Americans were well-briefed on the “mutually beneficial” Canada-U.S. economic and trading relationship. \n“I really felt I was pushing on an open door with everyone I spoke to.”\nFreeland’s comments come as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s office is trying to organize a meeting with Trump . \nA Trump adviser said a meeting was expected next week but Trudeau’s office would not confirm it. Trudeau travels to northern Canada Thursday and Friday, and to Germany from Feb. 15-18 next week. He’ll address the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, and will hold bilateral meetings with Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin.\nThe Canadian government has signalled a serious, measured approach to the arrival of Trump in the Oval Office, even as its ministers scramble to understand what Trump’s administration will do on the trade, security and border front. A Trudeau meeting with Trump would cap an intensive series of ministerial treks to Washington. First Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan on Monday. Freeland spent Tuesday and Wednesday in D.C., and Finance Minister Bill Morneau travels to Washington Thursday to meet with senior White House economic advisers. \nFreeland said her talks did not address border security or the influx of refugees across the Canada-U.S. border in Manitoba, but rather on “thinning the border.”\nShe downplayed NAFTA concerns , saying Canada “routinely modernizes” international trade deals. By her count, NAFTA has undergone 11 significant updates since coming into force Jan. 1, 1994. Freeland said she is meeting Canadian executives of the automotive sector and softwood lumber industry to prepare positions on NAFTA.\n“The best defence is a strong offence,” said Freeland. “Canada definitely will be and is good at taking strong offensive positions and we will do that if and when negotiations begin.”\nConservative trade critic Gerry Ritz, a former agriculture minister who handled negotiations with the U.S. on country-of-origin-labelling requirements, welcomed Freeland’s outreach but said the Canadian government still has “a lot of work to do” with like-minded allies in U.S. business circles, and at the state level.\n“Outlining the fact that we’re a willing trade partner but we’re not going to roll over to do trade is not a bad thing, but it’s not time to throw down the gauntlet quite yet.”\n“There’s many ways to do this without picking a fight in Washington . . . you can’t just go head-to-head with the administration in the U.S. You’re gonna lose. So you have to build up some clientele, some like-minded people throughout the United States.”\nNDP foreign affairs critic Hélène Laverdière questioned “what the minister means by ‘respond’ forcefully . . . we’ve seen every now and then strong words and little action. We’ll see when she comes back and if the worst happens how the government actually reacts.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T04:07:07.809+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
