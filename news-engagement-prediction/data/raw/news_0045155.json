Playing in the Premier League remains my lifelong dream,” said the Australian midfielder, who has scored eight goals this season. \nAccording to the report, Irvine was targeted by a number of Chinese Super League clubs after unexpected changes in January to how Chinese teams could recruit foreign players. \nPreviously Chinese clubs could recruit five foreign players including one from Asia, but after a change to the rule, clubs can now sign five players of any background.

In the past clubs could play three foreigners plus an Asian player. \nHowever, according to the report, Irvine’s seven appearances for Australia means he qualified as a ‘home-grown’ Chinese player, and that led to a scramble in China to sign him. \nWhen asked why he turned down a life-changing $8 million deal, he said: “I thought only two people in Britain knew about that — and one of them was my dad!” \n“When you see what was being offered, it’s hard to put it into words. \n“It’s not a decision a lot of people will ever be faced with. When you are it makes you ask a lot of questions about yourself. But hopefully you make the decision you are going to be most content with.

But it’s been and gone now and I’m fully focused on the job in hand — and that’s keeping Burton in the Championship.” \nIrvine added: “People can say things about footballers and about what motivates them. You have to respect why people make decisions in football, everyone has different goals. \n“People close to me know the way I live my life. Crazy money would be wasted on me. \n“I sincerely hope I never make decisions based purely on financial gain. I want to do things I want to do and sometimes it takes tough decisions to get there.” View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
