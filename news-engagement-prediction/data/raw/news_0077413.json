STEAM stands for \"science, technology, engineering, art , and mathematics.\" This teaching and learning philosophy is an expansive take on STEM , one that incorporates aspects of the humanities in its practices. \nIn the following interview, pioneering STEAM educator Nettrice Gaskins discusses the significance of including art alongside science, technology, engineering, and math. \nWI: How do you define STEAM education? How do you see it differing from STEM education? \nNG: STEAM education is an interdisciplinary approach to learning where rigorous academic concepts are coupled with artistic works and cultural practices as students apply science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics in contexts that make connections between school, community, personal interests and the global marketplace. STEM is more widely known but often leaves out art (creative and personal expression). STEAM doesn’t always include culture but I think culture is critical to engaging ethnic groups—African and Latino American, Indigenous—that are underrepresented in STEM fields. \nWI. How did you get interested and involved in STEAM? \nNG: Personally, I have been interested in STEAM since I was a teenager. My mother was a computer programmer at a time when I did not see any African American women doing that type of work. Back then, I was a budding artist who enjoyed chemistry, biology, geometry and, later, computer graphics. I was also a huge fan of hip-hop culture and, as a Ph.D. student, I noted that many hip-hop practitioners referred to STEM concepts in their interviews. Specifically, graffiti artists talked about using mathematics to create their pieces. This observation was made around the same time that the STEM to STEAM movement was gaining momentum in the United States and abroad. \nWI: How does the STEAM educational philosophy compare to our current ways of teaching science, technology, engineering, art, and math? \nNG: STEAM is interdisciplinary and researchers are exploring the multifaceted issues and challenges facing practitioners who go beyond, or work between disciplines. STEAM is often project based, using approaches that encourage students to actively explore real-world problems and challenges and acquire a deeper knowledge. Properly applied, the STEAM approach creates a kind of laboratory where learners experiment and try out new teaching ideas. \nWI: What role do you think STEAM has or should have in the education of girls and women ? \nNG: I am female, so I can talk about the impact of STEAM on my research and practice. I disliked math until I was able to explore math concepts using art. I didn’t like computers until a high school art teacher encouraged me to take a computer graphics class. Art was the motivator. I also saw myself reflected in my mother who was a programmer. I had teachers who worked with me one-on-one to build up my confidence. \nWI. What is the future of STEAM, especially in regards to women and girls? \nNG: It really depends on how much educators can broadly impact the way that STEAM is taught. Currently, the focus in public schools is testing and Common Core . Many teachers need more training and support to structure programs that are more suited to different learning styles and types of learners. More is being done to reach out to women and girls. However, culture (gender and ethnicity) which plays an important role in outreach is often overlooked. Even though I lived with a computer programmer who was African American and female, I needed more of an incentive to succeed in math and computing. It wasn’t that I couldn’t do the work. I did not enjoy it the way I did art. The visual art program at my high school was where I first explored computer graphics. Girls might be interested in fashion or music, so we have to met them halfway with STEM. My particular “brand” of STEAM is based on culturally responsive approaches that involve girls (and boys) from underrepresented ethnic groups. Culturally responsive teaching uses the cultural knowledge, prior experiences, and learning styles of diverse students to make learning more appropriate and effective for them; it teaches to and through the strengths of these students. Teaching girls to code is not enough. They have to see examples of women in STEM fields who look like them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T19:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:27:04.526+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
