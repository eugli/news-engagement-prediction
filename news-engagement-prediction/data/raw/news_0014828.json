Photo: Jane Dyson \nThe four-antigen vaccine will also offer protection against meningococcal strain A, C and Y. In 2016, there were a total of 262 of meningococcal cases of all strains. \nThe program will be expanded to cover other year 11 and year 12 high school students in the coming years, Mr Hazzard's office said. Teenagers at TAFE or undergoing apprenticeships will also be eligible. \n\"This week I made clear to senior health officials that the NSW Government would do whatever possible to protect our young people against Meningococcal W and other strains,\" Mr Hazzard said. \nIf any year 11 or year 12 students miss out on the vaccine at school they will be able to get vaccinated at their GP. \nMeningococcal is a disease caused via infection with Neisseria meningitidis . The bacteria grows in the back of the throat and nose and can spread from person to person via kissing, sneezing and coughing. \nThe percentage of people who are carriers increases from less than five percent in infants to roughly eight per cent in primary school children and up to 24 per cent in 19 year olds, before decreasing to about eight per cent in 50 year olds. \nBetween five and 25 per cent of carriers don't show any symptoms or illness. \nThe UK first introduced the vaccine for adolescents in 2015 . WA recently introduced a similar school-based program. \nThe program targets the group that offers the greatest protection to the individual and the broader community, NSW Health said. Parents with younger children and teenagers can pay for the vaccine, which costs more than $100 through pharmacies and GPs. \nInfants will be protected through herd immunity conferred from the program, NSW Health advised. \nCurrently one year olds are offered the meningococcal C vaccine free as part of the National Immunisation Program. \nLast Monday the federal Department of Health warned clinicians to be vigilant about diagnosing type W. \nThe new program is not part of the National Immunisation Program, but the Chief Medical Officer, Professor Brendan Murphy, has established a focused group within the Department to investigate its epidemiology and coordinate responses at the national level. \nThe review will consider the risks of the current and potential future trajectory of the disease as well as options for addressing the infection, within existing processes. \nFederal Health Department officials have been having discussions with pharmaceutical companies regarding options for managing meningococcal W disease.
