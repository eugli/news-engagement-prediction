It's going to be very bad for his health.” Article continues below \nHaye also took a dig at his opponent by saying: “He doesn't live the life. He says he does, he talks it, but look at his body and you can see you have obviously been eating something you shouldn't. \n\"He obviously wasn't training as hard as he should have been. If I didn't train and I just ate junk food all day long, I would have the same body as he would, that's plain and simple.\" Article continues below Arsenal fans left stunned by what staff told them about Alexis Sanchez [Times] \nNot to be outdone in the pre-bout verbal exchange, Bellew has hit back, calling him a disgrace to the sport. \nThe Liverpudlian said : “He's a disgrace. It's not the way we want our sport to be perceived. We're not in the dark ages… He's just an idiot, he doesn't think before he speaks. \n\"I'm trying to give it a good image. I'm not the best one to do it, because I've done some stupid things. I only speak the truth. He's just an idiot, he doesn't think before he speaks. \n\"He carries the sport in a bad way. I'm not saying I'm a saint by any stretch of the imagination, because I'm not, but I'm nowhere near this clown's level. He is just a disgrace to boxing.\" \nHe also agreed to give Haye a rematch if the former heavyweight champion lost. \n“If he loses to me, it will be the worst thing that has ever happened to him, but like I say, I'll give him the rematch. \n“If he loses to me, his rep and his ego have just been eaten, and I'll enjoy it when I put salt and pepper on them after I've finished.\" \nThe two boxers have recently been involved in a few fracases with each other. \nBack in November, they came head-to-head in the press conference where the March 4 bout was announced. Then again, they had to be separated by security staff during the filming of Sky Sports’ preview show for the bout - “The Gloves are Off”. \nHowever, the bad blood between the two Brits started when Bellew taunted Haye after his win over BJ Flores in October, where he called Haye “Sideshow Bob” and accused him of “conning the British public”. \nWhether the Hayemaker, as Haye likes to call himself, can establish his supremacy, or whether the cruiserweight champion can win his first foray in to heavyweight territory, the March 4 bout promises a lot of punches being thrown and not just verbal ones. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
