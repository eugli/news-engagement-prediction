(AFP/Getty Images) Brian Fung The Washington Post \nRegulators are telling nine companies they won't be allowed to participate in a federal program meant to help them provide affordable Internet access to low-income consumers - weeks after those companies had been given the green light. \nThe move, announced Friday by FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, reverses a decision by his Democratic predecessor, Tom Wheeler, and undercuts the companies' ability to provide low-cost Internet access to poorer Americans. In a statement, Pai called the initial decisions a form of \"midnight regulation.\" \n\"These last-minute actions, which did not enjoy the support of the majority of commissioners at the time they were taken, should not bind us going forward,\" he said. \nThe program, known as Lifeline, provides registered households with a $9.25-a-month credit, which can then be used to buy home Internet service. As many as 13 million Americans may be eligible for Lifeline that do not have broadband service at home, the FCC has found. Roughly 900 service providers participate in the Lifeline program. \nFor Kajeet Inc., one of the companies that was initially granted permission to provide service through Lifeline, the news comes as a blow. \n\"I'm most concerned about the children we serve,\" said Kajeet founder Daniel Neal. \"We partner with school districts - 41 states and the District of Columbia - to provide educational broadband so that poor kids can do their homework.\" \nSince becoming chairman last month, Pai has made closing the digital divide a central axis of his policy agenda. Although the vast majority of Americans have access to Internet service, there remain distinct gaps in U.S. broadband penetration, particularly among seniors, minorities and the poor. In his first address to FCC staff, Pai singled out the digital divide as one of the signature issues he hoped to address.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T10:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T05:24:02.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
