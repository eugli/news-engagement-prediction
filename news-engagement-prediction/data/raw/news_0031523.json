So Panneerselvam was given the responsibility.'' \nHowever, he is so ungrateful that he who first proposed my name for the CM's post started opposing me when I agreed later, Sasikala said. \nSasikala further stated that she is aware of the evil designs of 'traitors' like OPS and will not allow them to divide the party. \nWhen Amma passed away, I came to know about the conspiracy to divide the party, she told her loyalists, adding that she is 'not scared of anyone.' \n''We have seen 1000 such 'Panneerselvams'. For the past 33 years, we both have seen everything. So I am not scared.'' Sasikala said. \nSasikala, however, looked firm that she will eventually take charge as the Tamil Nadu chief minister. As far as I am concerned, we will take power, we will take oath, we will put Amma's photo in Assembly, Sasikala said. \nShe later came out of her Poes Garden residence to meet hundreds of supporters gathered outside. People's support is with me, we will continue to make AIADMK strong, she told the gathering. \nRemarks from Sasikala came shortly after O Panneerselvam attended office as acting CM at the Tamil Nadu Secretariat this morning. \nHe had resigned on February 5, paving the way for former CM J Jayalalithaa's longtime confidante VK Sasikala to take over the reins of the government, \nMeanwhile, Sasikala's party - the ruling AIADMK â€“ today asserted that a majority of its MLAs are behind their general secretary and claimed the chances of Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao \"inviting\" her today were \"high.\" \nParty spokesperson Vaigai Chelvan said Chief Minister Panneerselvam had the support of seven MLAs and cannot therefore prove his majority in the state Assembly in the event of a floor test. \n\"He says he can prove his majority based on the wrong information given by someone. Majority of the AIADMK MLAs are with Chinnamma (Sasikala) and we are ready to prove our strength (in a floor test),\" he told reporters here. \nSasikala was the elected Legislature Party leader of AIADMK and therefore the Governor should invite her to form government, he added. \n\"We expect the chances of his inviting (meeting) her today are high,\" he said. \nTo a question on 11 MPs switching over to the camp of Panneerselvam, Vaigai Chelvan expressed confidence that they would return to the Sasikala fold. \nIn growing support for Panneerselvam, six more AIADMK MPs had joined his camp yesterday, taking the number of Parliamentarians in his favour to 11. \nSasikala had yesterday vowed to protect the party nurtured by her long-time friend, late Jayalalithaa, saying \"I will give my life for this cause\". \nAddressing the MLAs at the resort near here, which she visited for the second time in two days, Sasikala had said, \"You 129 MLAs are like an ocean. None can contain it by building a check dam. No efforts will destabilise this government. None can hurt us and there is no need to fear.\" \nShe also dismissed allegations that they have been held \"hostage\" at the resort, saying the MLAs were staying at the resort of their own accord and that they were \"free\". \nWith PTI inputs First Published:   14:30 More from zeenews", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T15:31:44.692+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
