Die-hard fans of the brand and newcomers alike might recognize pieces like camp caps, hoodies, and wide-leg chinos. But some might be surprised to find—as always—a strong line-up of wearable and even understated pieces from the 23-year-old skate label. There's muted windbreakers, stripe polo shirts, burgundy corduroys, and—who are we kidding, a jacquard sweatsuit with pictures of Barack Obama all over it. \nThis isn't the first time Supreme has gotten political—in 2004, the brand released \"Fuck Bush\" stickers that plastered city streets and skate decks around the world. Other bold statement pieces include a very of-the-moment racing jacket made with Vanson, and a jacket featuring a rodeo cowboy drawn artist Jim Krantz. But rest assured while the new offering is big, when you add in all the sure-to-come collaborations Supreme has coming later this season, there'll be lots more to see over the next few months. That said, the first drop of the season is right around the corner on February 23, and online March 2.
