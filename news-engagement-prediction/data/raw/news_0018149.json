(Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWINTER PARK, Colo. — A legendary portal through the Rocky Mountains beneath the Continental Divide is once again making it possible for skiers and snowboarders to take a train directly to the ski lifts. \nDenver is again the only major American city where you can step onto a train and ride directly to the slopes. Other ski trains usually require a shuttle bus of some kind to cover the final miles, but Colorado's Winter Park Ski area sits directly adjacent to transcontinental Union Pacific railroad tracks emerging from the Moffat Tunnel. \nBored through the mountains in the late 1920s at 9,000 feet above sea level, the 6.2-mile-long Moffat Tunnel significantly shortened the distance for trains, and the route remains in heavy use today for freight and daily Amtrak California Zephyr service. Trains, glorious trains: Best rail photos and galleries \nFormally known as the Winter Park Express, the weekend-service ski train ferries passengers from the reborn Denver Union Station to Winter Park in the morning, then returns that evening. A similar service operated for 69 years but ended in 2009 over concerns about insurance and profitability. \nThe new train — two locomotives and nine passenger cars — can carry more than 500 people each way, helping reduce some of Colorado’s legendary Interstate 70 vehicle congestion. The inaugural run in January arrived nine minutes early, a major contrast to the traffic tie-ups 50 miles from the resort. The train journey takes about two hours, and leaves Denver in pre-dawn darkness, arriving at Winter Park just as the lifts are opening for the morning. Rides start at $39 each way. \nThe train passes through 29 tunnels, including the nine-minute-long Moffat Tunnel, as it climbs out of Denver to Winter Park. On its first day, the train charged through new-fallen snow, sending clouds of ice crystals swirling it its wake as the sun began rising over the plains to the east. \n“Best Christmas present ever,” said Kelly Garcia as she rode up from Denver. “I feel like it’s a Harry Potter train, honestly.” Facebook A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

The interstate closed again for hours the next day due to heavy snowfall and traffic. The train returned to to Denver a few minutes ahead of schedule. \n“This ski train is the only place in America, the only place in the world, where you can get out of your hotel bed, walk over to the train station, get on a train, and the train lets you off at the ski lift,” Hickenlooper said. “It’s as good as it gets anywhere in the world.” The most expensive ski vacation rentals in North America \nFor many longtime Denver-area residents, the ski train remains a fond memory. And now they’re having a chance to make new memories. Tourists can fly into Denver International Airport, take the new A-Line train from the airport to the station, and step aboard the ski train for an all-rail journey. \n“I think it’s fantastic, not only for the locals who don’t like to drive on I-70 but for the out-of-staters who want to come in and have a good experience,” said Susan Eikenberry of Lakewood, Colo. \nTrains will continue to run round-trip from Denver Union Station to the slopes of Winter Park on Saturdays and Sundays from Jan. 7 through March 26, 2017. Additional Monday round trips are scheduled for Presidents Day. Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. Train: Empire Builder.

USA TODAY Travel asked ZRankings, which uses a unique mix of hard data and expert opinions that paint a full picture of the 20 top ski resorts in North America, to create custom resort ratings. At No. 20 is Solitude Mountain Resort, with a Pure Awesomeness Factor (USAT-PAF) score of 80.7. With the glitz of Park City and the well-known credentials of Alta and Snowbird, Solitude Mountain Resort can get a little lost in the fray when it comes to Utah ski resorts. But it shouldn’t be. Like these other resorts, Solitude boasts easy access from a major international airport. Unlike the aforementioned group, however, Solitude’s slopes can be quite sparse, even on weekends, allowing the resort to live up to its moniker. Deer Valley, the new owner of Solitude, just upgraded the resort’s uppermost lift, the Summit Express, which will make getting to the nooks of Honeycomb Canyon even easier. Often, those nooks are full of powder, as Utah’s Big Cottonwood Canyon is one of the best places for snow on the planet — ranking Solitude No. 7 in North America for snow. For more information: zrankings.com/resort/show?id=147-solitude-mountain-resort Solitude Mountain Resort Fullscreen No. 19: Taos, with a USAT-PAF score of 81. A large percentage of skiers at Taos are repeat visitors who swear by the place. There's something to these high, steep slopes that grabs a certain kind of skier by the ear and says, \"this is THE place.\" The Kachina Peak lift, installed in 2014, gets skiers to an impressive 12,450 feet, and to a bevy of continuous steep lines rivaled by only a few resorts. The base village is quaint and quite compared to mainline resorts in Colorado. But the top-end lodging and dining here can compete with nearly anywhere. It takes a little more work to get here, as Albuquerque's airport is 135 miles away, but the tall pines and slopes of alpine New Mexico make it a worthwhile trip. For more information:zrankings.com/resort/show?id=162-taos-ski-resort Taos Fullscreen No. 18: Revelstoke, with a USAT-PAF score of 81.4. About a decade ago a group of investors, flush during the real estate boom, decided to make this outpost into a destination ski resort. The result is a mountain with North America's largest vertical drop, at 5,620 feet, which allows skiers to travel more than a mile in altitude from the resort's peak to its base. The vistas at Revelstoke, which include inner British Columbia's Selkirk Mountains and the Columbia River, are among the best in skiing. Getting here can be challenging: The resort suggests flying into Kelowna, a small airport that's still two hours away. When we went, we flew to Calgary and drove 4 1/2 hours west, through Banff. Once here, however, skiers can do laps, largely alone, on the longest runs in North America. For more information: zrankings.com/resort/show?id=185-revelstoke Revelstoke Fullscreen No. 17: Crested Butte, with a USAT-PAF score of 82. Crested Butte is a unique and genuine mountain town, with century-old buildings mingling with new resort properites that cater to the hard core and to those seeking luxury. The skiing here has a little bit of everything, but it's the technical terrain that makes Crested Butte stand apart. The steep fall lines here are the best in Colorado. That means the mountain requires a good helping of snow before it's 100% ready, so visits later in the winter make sense. For a Colorado resort, Crested Butte can be a little tougher to get to, as it's a four-hour drive from Denver and nearly two hours from Montrose's airport. Once in Crested Butte, however, skiers can fully unplug and soak up old-school Colorado.

Copper Mountain is one of the few big resorts in central Colorado not controlled by Vail Resorts. This means the Epic Pass won't work here, but it also means that crowds are generally thinner. Copper is on the East side of Vail pass, putting it 21 miles closer to Denver than Vail, but it does get less snow. The snow it does get, however, is very well preserved, as a whopping 55% of the resort's terrain faces north, keeping things nice and cold, even in the spring. For more information: zrankings.com/resort/show?id=42-copper-mountain Copper Mountain Fullscreen No. 15: Squaw Valley, with a USAT-PAF score of 85.9. This legendary track is what made Shane McConkey the skier he was. None of us can be quite that good, but Squaw Valley still allows mortals to ride up KT-22 and Granite Chief to ply some of the finest terrain in North America. Squaw hosted the Winter Olympics in 1960, but most of the extensive base village has been added or remodeled since then. Squaw remains the only resort in North America with a funitel, a high-speed gondola that runs on two wires instead of one, allowing it to operate at ultra-fast speeds even in windy conditions. Getting to Squaw from the Reno airport is a relatively straight-forward shot down I-80 that only takes 52 minutes. For more information: zrankings.com/resort/show?id=149-squaw-valley Squaw Valley Fullscreen No. 14: Big Sky, with a USAT-PAF score of 87.1. This behemoth 5,800-acre resort has mounds of terrain with very modest people traffic — a combination that all skiers seek out. The steeps off of Lone Peak are legitimate and deserve experts' respect. The rest of the skiing at Big Sky is rather mellow, offering families a great spot to spread out and ski in formation. The village has grown during the last decade to include a bevy of worthy lodging. Air service into Bozeman, about an hour away, is among the best of any regional ski airport. For more information: zrankings.com/resort/show?id=21-big-sky-resort Big Sky Fullscreen No. 13: Deer Valley, with a USAT-PAF score of 88.7. Deer Valley is the ultimate in perfectly manicured luxury. The grooming is exquisite, the lodging perhaps unmatched in skiing, and the food — the food is worth the trip. Deer Valley's turkey chili, in particular, deserves an award all its own for being the best standard cafeteria fare in all of skiing. Deer Valley also has the extra equity of being on top of one of the best ski towns in North America in Park City, and easy access to Salt Lake City's airport, with directs to all major cities. For more information: zrankings.com/resort/show?id=47-deer-valley-resort Deer Valley Fullscreen No. 12: Breckenridge, with a USAT-PAF score of 89.1. Also a member of the Vail Resorts family, Breckenridge often wins the title as the busiest ski mountain in the United States. There's lots of reasons people like it, from its varied terrain at altitude — its lifts top out at 12,840 feet — to Breckenridge the town, which is packed with shops and restaurants. The heart of this resort is great for families, with tons of wide groomers and little stashes in the trees. For more information: zrankings.com/resort/show?id=29-breckenridge-ski-resort Breckenridge Fullscreen No. 11: Winter Park, with a USAT-PAF score of 89.5. Winter Park is somewhat removed from the tenderloin of ski mountains that line the central corridor of I-70 in Colorado. Being further north, on the opposite side of Berthoud Pass, keeps this place quieter than most other Colorado resorts. The base area and lodging has been built up well during the last 15 years. Winter Park is the No. 2 ranked resort for snow in Colorado, and it well preserves its annual bounty of 349 inches a year with 50% of its terrain facing north. For more information: zrankings.com/resort/show?id=180-winter-park-ski-resort Winter Park Fullscreen No. 10: Beaver Creek, with a USAT-PAF score of 89.7. Just west on I-70 from Vail sits Beaver Creek, which, though it was built more than 30 years ago, still counts as one of the newer resorts in skiing. This place is known for its plush accommodations, but it can be an excellent spot for powder skiing — with the sixth best snow in Colorado — and some longer fall lines. Also not to be missed: free chocolate chip cookies at closing time. Look for the people in the blue jackets. The Beav is owned by Vail Resorts, which means it accepts the Epic Pass. For more information: zrankings.com/resort/show?id=17-beaver-creek-resort Beaver Creek Fullscreen No. 9: Steamboat, with a USAT-PAF score of 89.9. This mountain is built for families seeking varied terrain and a bevy of on-mountain amenities and lodging. Steamboat ranks as the No. 2 resort in Colorado for snow quantity. It's also buoyed by one of the better ski towns in Colorado — one of the top three with Telluride and Aspen — and an airport that has built up excellent service across the country. For more information: zrankings.com/resort/show?id=150-steamboat-ski-resort Steamboat Fullscreen No. 8: Alta, with a USAT-PAF score of 90.5. Alta is low on frills and high on powder and most other things that matter to a hard-core skiing experience. Sitting next door to Snowbird, Alta doesn't have the vertical of its neighbor, but it actually gets even more snow, making it ZRankings' No. 1 mountain in North America for snow. Skiing here is best done with a local, but it's something that should be done whether you find a local or not. Alta also offers skiers great access with a quick 45-minute drive from Salt Lake City's airport, a hub for Delta. For more information: zrankings.com/resort/show?id=4-alta-ski-area Alta Fullscreen No. 7: Vail, with a USAT-PAF score of 90.8. Always a leader among the best ski resorts in Colorado, the flagship resort of the company that has made more of an impact on the ski industry than any other — Vail Resorts — deserves kudos. Vail constantly strives to improve its guests' experiences, including in the summer, when Vail Village has become almost as populated as during the winter. A new six-passenger Avanti Express has been installed for this winter, which will alleviate congestion on the front of the mountain. Vail also ranks highly for snow (No. 4 in Colorado). For more information: zrankings.com/resort/show?id=169-vail-ski-resort Jack Affleck, Vail Resorts Fullscreen No. 6: Snowbird, with a USAT-PAF score of 91.4. Snowbird is only 43 minutes from a major international airport in Salt Lake City, and it ranks No. 2 in North America for snow. That's a lot to love. Even better, Snowbird just dumped $35 million into its already impressive mountain for the coming winter. Improvements include a full remodel on rooms at The Cliff, the best ski hotel in America, and a new lodge at the top of the tram called The Summit. For more information: zrankings.com/resort/show?id=141-snowbird Snowbird Fullscreen No. 5: Telluride, with a USAT-PAF score of 91.9. There exists no town at the base of a ski resort with a more stunning setting than Telluride's. This elite ski town completes the experience, but the skiing deserves plenty of credit. Telluride can cater to expert skiers seeking chutes and steeps, as well as beginners and intermediates looking for those easy-pitched rollers. For a dinner spot, Allred's, at the top of the gondola (free to ride for everybody) isn't to be missed. Adding to Telluride's cred: it's home to Wagner Skis, the best custom ski shop in the world. For more information: zrankings.com/resort/show?id=163-telluride-ski-resort Telluride Fullscreen No. 4: Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, with a USAT-PAF score of 92.7. Jackson Hole has risen from being a sleepy winter outpost known for its summers to one of the vanguard ski resorts in all the world. This mountain is deservedly known for its expert terrain, which ranks No. 1 at ZRankings. But it also has a soft side, with a wide selection of groomers worth cruising and a portfolio of lodging — the Four Seasons at Jackson Hole is slopeside — and dining that marks it as an alpha resort. Its airport has non-stop service into 13 cities including Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Newark. For more information: zrankings.com/resort/show?id=70-jackson-hole Jackson Hole Mountain Resort Fullscreen No. 3: Whistler-Blackcomb, with a USAT-PAF score of 93.9. The largest ski resort in North America, Whistler-Blackcomb occupies two peaks in British Columbia's coastal range north of Vancouver. Getting there takes a little more work — flying to Vancouver plus a 100-minute drive to Whistler Village — but once there skiers have it all: elite snowfall, a bevy of good dining options and terrain for everybody. This season is off to a particularly excellent start, as Whistler has been socked with gobs of snow since Nov. 1. For more information: zrankings.com/resort/show?id=184-whistler Whistler-Blackcomb Fullscreen No. 2: Aspen Snowmass, with a USAT-PAF score of 96.1. This ranking includes the four mountains that comprise the Aspen Snowmass empire: Aspen Mountain, Aspen Highlands, Aspen Snowmass and Buttermilk. There is terrain for all kinds of skiers across this network. The fall lines at Aspen Mountain and Highlands are long and steep; Buttermilk is perfect for kids. When flying to Aspen's airport, which receives more flights than any other regional ski town airport, the commute is only 10 minutes from tarmac to skiing. Aspen, like Park City, is one of the preeminent mountain towns in North America, with dining and shopping options to rival Manhattan. For more information: zrankings.com/resort/show?id=142-aspen-snowmass Jordan Curet, Aspen Daily News Fullscreen No. 1: Park City Mountain Resort, with a USAT-PAF score of 99. After merging with Canyons, Park City is now the second largest ski resort in North America at 7,300 acres and the largest in the United States. Its score is boosted by its easy access to a major airport at 34 minutes, perhaps the best ski town in all of North America, and a plethora of varied terrain. The dining and nightlife offered in Park City are good enough to entertain celebrities, who descend on the town once a year for the Sundance Film Festival. Park City, because it's now owned by Vail Resorts, also accepts Vail's Epic Pass, one of the better deals in skiing.
