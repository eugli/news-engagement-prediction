But when placed in the savviest of hands, the social media update can show off the kind of self-expression that goes far beyond conspicuous preening. It can often reveal personal growth. Such is the case of R&B singer-songwriter Kehlani —née Kehlani Ashley Parrish—whose chameleonic looks and career trajectory in the past year have been as multifaceted as the title of her newly released album, SweetSexySavage , might suggest. In a matter of days, her hairstyle (as seen on Instagram) might morph from a black wavy pixie cut to a waist-length mane to a bone-straight sheet of scarlet locks. Soon after, wet and wavy ringlets fall gracefully over the tomboy chanteuse’s shoulders. Such fickle personal style might reflect all the big changes Kehlani has dealt with this year: her first Grammy nomination (for the You Should Be Here mixtape), the release of her hit “Gangsta” off the Suicide Squad soundtrack, a 21st birthday, and her own fair share of personal trauma. Photographer: Mayan Toledano But in an interview, the Oakland native dismissed the hair switch-ups as nothing more than her own mercurial grooming habits. “I was just on some ‘Girl, change your life’ shit,” Kehlani says lightheartedly. Working with her hairstylist, Kahh Spence, the two make new wigs that shift between, well, the sweet, sexy, and savage moods she seems to be inhabiting these days. “It’s like having an alter ego. Everyone loves dress-up, right?” To be sure, the former America’s Got Talent contestant loves a costume change, like the very ones her fans will witness at tonight’s New York stop on her world tour. Known for her signature “cozy girl” staples of oversize sweatpants and ab-skimming tank tops, Kehlani will instead be tapping into her inner vixen and slipping into sleek spandex, leotards, and shiny tights as she takes center stage for her nearly sold-out 60-city tour. Photographer: Mayan Toledano Still, there are breakout borrowed-from-the-boys moments, like the Julia Seemann leather motocross two-piece that the Swiss designer sent Kehlani personally. Reminiscent of the wares of R&B bad girls like Aaliyah, Pink, and Destiny’s Child, the rugged look seems to speak to a “get you a girl that can do both” duality that flows throughout Kehlani’s personal style. As she tells Vogue.com , she’s been adopting a blend of feminine and mature looks that are less reliant upon athleisure. Her trusted stylist, Debbie Gonzales, has much to do with coaxing Kehlani out of this zone. “Debbie is my big sister, who has not only been there as a stylist but also a best friend and a trusted confidant. I tend to give Debbie a basis of what I like and she always manages to find just that,” Kehlani explains. “She makes me get out of my comfort zone and try new stuff, but she also listens when I tell her there are certain things I won’t ever do, like a cocktail dress or club-girl dresses.” As adventurous as Kehlani is becoming in her fashion choices, she can never stray too far from the Kids of Immigrants pieces she’s seen wearing here. The designers are practically family and their fashions make up a huge part of her wardrobe. “One thing I can’t go onstage without is a piece of Kids of Immigrants and my trusted Dr. Martens boots,” she says. Still, with her being on the road for the remainder of the year, it would seem the singer is bound to pick up a few styling hacks along the way (“I can’t wait to shop in Berlin!”). No doubt, they’ll fit any mood she’s in.
