It disrupts ongoing business operations. And it threatens companies’ ability to attract talent, business, and investment to the United States,” it argues. \nThe document also highlights the role of immigrants and their children as innovators in America and questions the lawfulness of the ban. \nThe US tech sector has been amongst the most vocal in criticizing the executive order since it was signed by President Trump in December. The controversial move was blocked nationwide by a federal judge last week, angering the White House. The Trump administration unsuccessfully tried to overturn the block over the weekend and has until Monday to present arguments to try to convince the Court of Appeals to lift it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T17:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T12:39:24.359+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
