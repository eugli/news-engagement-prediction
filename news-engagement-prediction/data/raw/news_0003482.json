ABC News: Jessica Strutt \nThe Labor and Liberal parties have labelled controversial comments about single mothers by a One Nation candidate as \"offensive and rude\", but both have declined to rule out striking a preference deal with the party ahead of the March state election. \n\"His comments were offensive and rude and I think they were totally inappropriate,\" he said. \nLiberal Deputy Premier Liza Harvey said Mr Archibald should rethink his comments. \n\"I'm a single mum myself and I've got to say, it's bloody hard sometimes being a single parent and he should perhaps one day have a walk in the shoes of a single mum or a single dad and rethink his comments,\" she said. \nDeputy Prime Minister and federal Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce also waded into the issue, saying he does not agree with Mr Archibald. \n\"Don't start suggesting to someone, all the nuances of their life, and think you understand them. Empathy is probably a better approach. Find on what's going on in their life and see what you can do to help,\" he said. Labor, Liberal decline to rule out One Nation preference deal \nMr McGowan would not be drawn on how Labor would handle preferences with One Nation. \n\"You can talk to the party about those issues, those sorts of issues I am not going to talk about today,\" he said. \nFigures from both major parties showed One Nation could play a substantial role in the state election, with polling suggesting its popularity had surged in recent months.
