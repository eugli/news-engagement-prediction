I found some bath salts.\n'Lit some candles and poured in some coconut oil - now I am realizing it was too much coconut oil.'\nOnce the water receded she said she was left 'sliding around' unable to get herself out of the tub.\n'Went to get out after pulling the plug and I just slide around like a giant greased up potato in a roasting dish.\n'There is no traction. No grip. Just me and my fat body slipping around covered in oil. F**k home beauty remedies. SOS,' she wrote.\nPlea for help: The Australian, who was at home sick with a chest infection and fever, got stuck after attempting a DIY 'remedy'\nFree: Eventually, after half an hour, she managed to get out by filling the bath with water and scrubbing off the oil\nAfter 30 minutes stranded, she said she managed to get out by filling the bath with water and scrubbing it.\n'You really shouldn't use coconut oil in the bath. It can re-solidify in your drains and back everything up. Unless it is fractionated,' said 'HeatherWhatever'.\nAs well as advice, she received numerous comments about her feet - ranging from compliments to concern from people who thought her ankle could be either dislocated or broken.\nThe woman replied: 'Nar [sic]. They are just fat.' She added: 'Update on inbox messages: thought it would be d**k pics and show us t**s. Turns out there are a lot of people with foot fetish on here.'\nOne Quote: : 'You didn't chose the Tub life, the Tub life chose you.'\n'I too enjoy coating myself in oil so i can pretend to be a slug,' another user added.", "external_links": ["http://imgur.com/gallery/3mD4u"], "published": "2017-02-02T23:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T10:36:34.722+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
