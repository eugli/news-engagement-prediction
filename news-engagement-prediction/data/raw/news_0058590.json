I hated it. It was bland. There was no range or any emotion. The story wasn't smart, or clever, or engaging, or funny. It was just... boring, and slow, and a downer. Look, if you're an art-film student, maybe you will find the beauty in the movie. But if you're looking for a \"good time\" or a nice \"date movie\" this is NOT what you're looking for. I wish I could go back in time and not watch this trash. dont trust the tomato meter, horrible movie by abcdxyz12345abcdxyz I should have read the customer's ratings before wasting my money renting this movie. Nothing good about it, just weird, not funny, not dramatic, not interesting, just really really weird. Struggled to watch half of it then finally stopped just could not go on. Complete bore. by 11kitty What a waste of time and $$. Do not, repeat, do not rent this movie.It is slow, ridiculous and thoughtless. I thought Colin Ferrell would be in a better movie than this which is why I rented it.
