Kardashian West shared several Snapchat videos to express her discontent with her sisters, who started their training session 30 minutes late, which led to the trainer being late for Kardashian West’s session. \n“So me and my friend Nikki are waiting for [our trainer] Joe to get here because my sisters’ workout ran 30 minutes late,” she said. “Thanks a——-.” \nThe 36-year-old star got even more frustrated and put the snow bunny Snapchat filter to send this message: “Okay, seriously, Kourtney and Khloe: f— you. This is so rude. I have been sitting in my garage waiting for the trainer for 30 minutes.

Kim hung out with her son Saint West and Khloé enjoyed a protein shake.
