For the couples, it all hinges on a few hours over dinner, but for the team behind hit TV show First Dates , that pivotal meeting at the bar is the culmination of weeks of work. Stevie Martin finds out how they get it so right, so often. The success stories Ibiba, 28, a carer, and Aarron, 32, who has his own car interior design business, met during series seven last year What happened? Their instant physical attraction and mutual love for their kids got them off to a great start. They discovered their mums are both Rastafarians and the bond was sealed. Ibiba definitely knew that she fancied him, saying, ‘I like his mouth and I felt he had a warm, friendly face.’ Aarron commented that they had so much in common (‘our mannerisms are the same’). Was it love at first sight? Completely. What happened next? They got the train home together. Aarron texted Ibiba and they went on a few more dates and met each others’ families. He accidentally let slip that he loved her one day and, some months later, they discovered they were expecting a baby. What’s happening now? Their baby is due this spring. Sheila, 81, a retired reflexologist who was widowed eight years ago, and Bev, 79, who used to work in communications and was widowed two years ago, met on the spin-off show First Dates Hotel in France last year The background Sheila said going on First Dates was her ‘last opportunity to find love’ and that she ‘loved adventures’. Before he died her husband said, ‘Don’t be on your own, Sheila. Find someone to love, you’ve got a lot of love to give.’ Bev, who was married for 40 years, describes losing his wife as the worst time in his life. What happened on the date? Sheila read bartender Merlin her requirements for a man, including clean fingernails, music lover, nice feet, clean shaven. Then Bev arrived sporting a beard. When she told Bev about her list, she said, ‘Maybe you can tick all the other boxes?’ Bev was looking for a woman to give him ‘cuddles, kisses and affection’. Was it love at first sight? No, but Sheila said it ‘could be my first holiday romance’. As the evening progressed, the couple discovered a mutual love of classical music, theatre and travelling. They shared a kiss and Bev said that Sheila was the first woman he had kissed since his wife died. What happened next? Later that night they went to their rooms and Sheila gave Bev a foot massage. They met again for breakfast the next morning and discussed going on a cruise and agreed they had made a good decision to see each other again. Bev said they were looking for the same thing – companionship. What’s happening now? Sheila and Bev have continued to meet, including going to a jazz festival together. Ajai, 39, an accountant, met Hema, 32, a photographic retouch manager, during series seven last year What happened? Ajai was very keen to make accountancy sexy and turned up for his date in a bow tie.Hema had been single for five years but confessed she’d always wanted to be married, to which Ajai revealed he had proposed three times…but never been married. Although initially shocked, Hema was willing to overlook this and they ended the date so engrossed in each other’s conversation (including a game of ‘Would you rather?’) that they didn’t realise the restaurant was closing. Was it love at first sight? Not exactly. Ajai thought Hema was gorgeous but it turned out that, despite having a great time, Hema was not a fan of his handlebar moustache. What happened next? Their next date was a trip to the barbers where Ajai had his beard and moustache trimmed. What’s happening now? It’s a big year for the couple… They are jetting off to New York for Ajai’s 40th and in the coming weeks Hema will meet Ajai’s mother for the first time. Dan (right), 43, a communications manager, and Adam, 41, a painter and decorator, met on series four in 2015 Was it love at first sight? Dan says it was love at first sight – within 15 minutes at the bar he knew it was special. There was an instant click when Dan and Adam realised that they would be working in the same town the week following their date. What happened next? They exchanged numbers and headed home. They texted each other all the way back – and met four times that week! What’s happening now? They moved in together in Bury St Edmunds, got engaged and are due to marry in Cape Town in February 2019. The people behind the dates Kim Rossiter, senior casting director Kim Rossiter, senior casting director I deal mostly with the first part of the matching process , although I float around during shoot days. When choosing daters, there is a team of 12 on the phones, speaking to people who filled in the two-page application form online. For series eight we had 205,000 applicants. The team calls between 20 and 30 people dail y . They are given a different category to focus on each day so I can make sure we’re getting a good range of people. One day they’ll be calling young, hot 20-somethings, the next, flamboyant octogenarians. We get far more women applying than men ; it’s around a 60-40 split. The most common age group is 18 to 40, with a lot of young people. Over 40 you get a big male drop-off; probably only 50 men who were 60-plus applied for the new series. I’m proud of the range of LGBT applicants we get; we really can represent anybody – provided they want to go on a date. We have to do a lot of Facebook stalking to make sure daters don’t know each other. Ideally we want to match people who are geographically close, because it’s easier for them to date after the show. While all the checks are rigorous, sometimes people slip through the net. Once we had two men from Liverpool, Paul and Richie, and we had a gut feeling that they might know each other because they were both on the same sort of scene. But they passed the tests: they weren’t friends on Facebook and had no mutual friends on social media. Then, when they were introduced on their date, they realised they’d met before on a night out. On the application form you can tick a box that says whether you’re happy to be contacted as a background dater – someone who is on a date, but won’t be focused on – rather than a main dater, and there is a smaller second team who look to match those people. We usually have three or four main couples featured at one time and there will be an afternoon sitting followed by an evening sitting. On a Friday morning, the team tell me who they’ve selected from the phone interviews to come for a 20-minute on-camera audition at our London offices. I look at the tapes after they’ve been cut and pick who goes through to the boards in the matching room where I, along with around 30 directors and producers, try to find everyone a match. The First Dates matchmakers, from left: Barnaby Coughlin, Vari Innes and Kim Rossiter If someone has suffered a trauma in their past, we arrange sessions with a psychologist , so they’re well looked after. It might not be the right time for that person, so maybe they’ll come back and see us in a year. We get everyone, from former addicts and ex-convicts through to people who have suffered abuse, and we welcome all kinds of stories. The most common one we get is about a cheating ex and even then sometimes it’s important to get them to see a psychologist. We do really care! I’ve worked in TV for a long time on shows such as The Apprentice and MasterChef, and while I love my job, I can’t watch those series once I’ve worked on them. First Dates is the exception. I’m currently on maternity leave, but last week my husband and I did a First Dates marathon. I can’t not watch it. My favourite part of working on the show is seeing the couples meet at the bar. Months of work, all for that one moment! It’s so nerve-racking. In terms of dating advice, I’d say don’t be the only one who gets drunk. Get drunk with your date, that’s fine – but don’t do it on your own! And it’s important not to be too self-deprecating. On series seven there was a dater called Riki who constantly talked about how he always gets friend-zoned. He kept putting himself down and I remember thinking, ‘That’s how you friend-zone yourself.’ Have confidence in who you are! Vari Innes, producer-director Vari Innes, producer-director I keep coming back to this show because I adore the match interviews. After the weekly match meetings, all the show directors are assigned a pair, who they interview separately for an hour and a half each. The idea is that we get under their skin – in a nice way – and find out what makes them tick so we can make sure we’ve matched them with the right person. People share their deepest secrets with you. This morning I interviewed a lovely young woman for the upcoming series who had been involved with someone who had terminal cancer. She knew about it at the time, but had thought that would help her with the grief. Of course, it didn’t. The inevitable happened. She said, ‘I really miss him’ and broke down, and I cried, too. You get so invested in people’s stories and it’s a real privilege. A lot of people think they want a certain type of person but, actually, they’re stuck in a cycle of choosing the same type again and again , which may be the wrong fit. During the match interview we try to help them work out whether they’d like someone different and who that could be. I interviewed a pair yesterday for the next series, who came in one after the other, and you can tailor your questions to see if you’ve picked the right date for them, and vice versa. I think they’re going to be a great match – I can’t wait to see what happens on their date. The bit before the date is so exciting. You get those who are a bit cocky, but deep down everyone is nervous. Most of the fear at that point is about how they look, so compliments from us are really important. There are lots of friendly faces – a care team from production and everyone they’ve met during the audition stage – and we all get excited about what they’re wearing, as well as calming them down and reminding them why they’re there. Once the daters have walked across the square into the restaurant, all the team head to a car park underneath it where there’s a huge wall of screens set up. We have food and sit covered in blankets, headphones on, watching the dates unfold. Oh God, there is so much screaming at the screen. We want it to go well and it’s disappointing when it doesn’t. I feel bad for them if it doesn’t work out because I feel I’ve got to know them. I’m always looking for the moment when they fall in love and when it happens, no matter how many dates I’ve seen, I melt. The date goes on for however long the couple want it to. If they’re the last ones at the restaurant with the staff all waiting to go home, then that’s just a sign of a great date! ‘We find out what makes the daters tick so we can match them with the right person,’ says Vari The post-date interviews are my favourite thing after the match interviews. I love how honest they are. When you’re dating, you don’t usually get feedback. But these interviews run for 15-20 minutes before they’re cut down for the show, so the pair really learn about each other. We also try to leave the shots running for as long as possible so you can feel the tension. That’s why sometimes there’s a bit of a gap before we ask whether they want to see each other again. And we don’t nudge them for an answer either, so it’s very real. Of course we want a variety of outcomes, but if you get a lot of non-matches in one episode, that’s real, that’s life. We keep in contact with the couples during the edit, so when we’re ready to air, we ask how it has gone since and can decide which dates to do updates on in the end credits. We can only choose three dates and it’s usually quite obvious which will work – those we feel had the best story or the ones we really rooted for. One thing I’ve noticed about dating is that people want to be charismatic and funny and ‘the best me’ when, actually, a lot of the time it’s about listening to what the person across from you is telling you. Some people really don’t listen. I’ve also seen that the so-called deal-breakers people tell us about actually aren’t deal-breakers at all when they’re sitting across from a person who is really good for them. One of our older returners (daters can come back), Teresa – an amazing woman with purple hair – told us she wasn’t keen on guys who wear socks and sandals. Her date turned up in socks and sandals – and it didn’t matter. They went together perfectly! Barnaby Coughlin, executive producer Barnaby Coughlin, executive producer I love it when we find a story that really says something. We had a 37-year-old woman called Annie on the show who had incurable cancer. She was this beautiful woman who was so cool. She came to the offices and said, ‘If there’s one point in my life I want love, it’s now, before I die.’ We ummed and ahhed about her because she is vulnerable and finding someone who could confidently deal with that would be really difficult. In the end we found this lovely man for her, and while Annie didn’t end up fancying him, the way she articulated her condition and her attitude to life blew him away. I just thought, ‘F*** my problems.’ It put everything in perspective. I get choked up a lot. I remember a lovely 82-year-old man called Terence who talked about how his wife died. He had been in the RAF so was away a lot and he said, ‘I never told her I loved her enough and I’ll always regret it.’ He welled up and I started welling up, too. I’m married and when I’m in the edit, I text my partner things such as, ‘By the way, I really love you and I’ll never cheat. OK, bye!’ The weekly match meetings are a lot of fun. After the daters have come in for the taped auditions, we have a card for each with their name, height, job and location, as well as likes and dislikes, and the team talks it over. There’s also a screen so we can watch their audition highlight videos because sometimes when you see two people talking side-by-side you can visualise it happening in the restaurant. We discuss so many people, you’d think we’d never remember them. But they get logged in my mind, so in match meetings I find myself going, ‘How about Claire from last week with Bobby from this week?’ Or I’ll be trying to go to the loo and a director will grab me and say they ‘need to talk about Linda’. We really care about these people. I’ve never worked in a job like this before. We get a lot of people on First Dates who wouldn’t normally be on TV. The characters we’re drawn to are those that are there for a reason, and we only want people on the show who we feel we can help, real people. We had one man called Derek who worked in the City but couldn’t take the rat race, so moved back to Chichester and used to sit at home and watch First Dates. He found it hard to talk to anyone and couldn’t get a girlfriend, but he saw that we genuinely care about the people we feature, so he applied and we helped him find a date. It didn’t work out but it’s the first step, right? Vari, Barnaby and Kim discuss the dates with their team in a match meeting We never feature people for entertainment’s sake. If they’re badly behaved then it’s important to explain why. For example, Abi, a yoga instructor, was really mean about her date, asking him, ‘Do you get funnier the more you drink?’ But her date opened her up and we found out why she was acting like that: she had her guard up because she’d been hurt. Everyone can act weirdly on a date, but it doesn’t mean they’re a bad person. We’ve all been hurt and can all act out. None of the waiting staff are briefed on the dates beforehand. CiCi, Laura and Sam are excellent at reading people and making them feel comfortable. Fred [the maître d’], of course, helps the daters out hugely with compliments, tips and little asides – far more than we have time to feature in the final cut. I was on the team that found him for series three. He’s been a maître d’ for 20 years and I can confidently say he is just the same off camera as he is on. Merlin is amazing, too. He’s an award-winning bartender and he’s been talking to people from behind the bar all his life. He’s just as good as some of our interviewers! We’ve got a real surprise in store for the Valentine’s Day episode. Actually, two surprises. One of them is a First Dates first, which is amazing considering you’d think we’d have done everything! I mean, we’ve had a pregnancy, proposals… But this is going to be a really fun episode. I can’t wait. First Dates: Be My Valentine is on Channel 4 tomorrow at 9pm Why we love First Dates by the restaurant staff Fred, maitre d' My favourite moment is when people come through the door and set eyes on each other. That is where the story unfolds. Even though you have an indication of whether it may work, the human heart is such that you never know what’s truly going on inside it. CiCi, waitress It makes me giggle every time when one person goes in for a peck on the cheek, and the other goes for a hug. You end up with this beautifully awkward embrace where neither one knows what to do. Merlin, bartender One of the times I felt most awkward was when Anthea Turner came in. She was so full of hope and charm for a first date, but her date was a little stiff when he turned up. I think they warmed up eventually, but it wasn’t to be. Next time, Anthea, next time… The most popular drink is a gin and tonic – guests can be quite specific as to how they like it, too. And things don’t always go smoothly: I’ve certainly accidentally smashed glasses. I’m actually quite clumsy. Laura, waitress My top tip for date nerves is always alcohol – in moderation. Talking of nerves, it doesn’t always go smoothly in the restaurant. I once dropped a steak knife in a woman’s wine glass and it smashed! I also knocked a bottle of Coke into a woman’s bag and it spilled inside. But I’m learning to make it look smooth after I’ve messed up instead of pointing it out to everyone… WIN A ROMANTIC FIRST DATES DINNER FOR TWO!
