The boy from Saharanpur left behind a suicide note in which he blamed his neighbours for blackmailing him.\nThe incident happened at Gangoh town in Saharanpur, where the 13-year-old boy hung himself from a ceiling fan at his house on Wednesday evening. According to his relatives, the boy was asked for a sum of money by the neighbours in return for keeping the secret. With much difficulty he was able to arrange only Rs 200, which was not accepted by the blackmailers, two women.\nUnable to bear the fear of getting exposed in front of his parents, the boy decided to take his life. He also left a suicide note apologising to his family and explaining some of the events.\nThe boy's father, Ravinder, who works in a pharmaceutical plant in Panipat, rushed home on hearing the news. \"It was the fault of Deepa Devi and Pooja Kumari, two of our neighbours, that this happened. They drove my son to kill himself. I wish he had at least confided in his mother, if not me. We could have prevented all this,\" the father said.\nSoon after the post mortem on Thursday morning, the relatives of the boy placed his body on the road outside Gangoh police station and demanded that the two accused women be immediately arrested.\nThe suicide note, a copy of which is with TOI blames the two women for blackmailing the boy.\nPolice, on the other hand, have dismissed the money angle. Senior superintendent of police, Saharanpur, Love Kumar, told TOI over the phone, \"It is really an unfortunate incident and a rare one, in which a child of such a tender age has taken his own life. The suicide note indicates that two women had blackmailed the lad. Both Pooja Kumari, 20 and Deepa Devi, 30 are absconding. However, we cannot say anything with certainty till they are arrested. An FIR has been lodged against the two under section 306 (abetment of suicide) of the IPC.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T05:30:09.723+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
