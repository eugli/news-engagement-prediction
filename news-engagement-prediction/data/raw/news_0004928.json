But I really hate cleaning up afterward — and I know I'm not alone. \nWhether you have a dishwasher or have to scrub all of your plates and pans by hand, keeping your kitchen spick and span takes work. After dinner, I'd rather bask in my food coma and watch some TV. \nLuckily, there are some simple things anyone can pick up to streamline their cooking process and make cleaning up a relative breeze. If you have a problem these cooking accessories can't solve, let us know. \nThis article was originally published on 10/14/2016. A splatter guard Amazon \nCranking up your stove top's heat can speed up your meal's cook time, but it also leaves unwanted sauce and grease splatters on your countertops, walls, and backsplash. Rest this guard on top of your pan and it'll keep splatters and condensation at bay. A clip-on strainer Amazon \nThis strainer is the perfect alternative to balancing a colander full of pasta in one hand and a hot pot in the other, plus it's easy to clean. A 3-in-1 cutting board Amazon \nInstead of using several plates to rest your freshly chopped vegetables on, invest in this handy cutting board. It comes with two inserts — a colander and tray — so you have one convenient place to cut and store your produce and meats.When each ingredient is ready to be added to your recipe, you can detach the insert, drop its contents in your pan, and repeat. Depending on how many ingredients you're slicing and dicing, you could end up saving a lot of time and space in your dishwasher. A smart kitchen scale Amazon \nThis high-tech scale makes cooking easy from start to finish. It comes with an app that tells you when you've added enough flour, sugar, and spice to whatever you're making, and it saves you the trouble of using multiple bowls and measuring cups. The apps also walks you through tons of great meals, so you can bolster your recipe repertoire while you're at it. An herb infuser Amazon \nOtoto's herb infuser is a must-have for anyone who likes to make stews and soups. All you need to do is load your herbs and spices into the infuser and drop it into your broth. The result? A soup that packs a punch but doesn't have any stray spice leaves floating around. An egg separator Amazon \nSeparating an egg is not as easy as you'd think. If we get even a small bit of eggshell in our bowl, most of us will grab a fork to fish it out, and eventually create more of a mess. Emson's egg separator can crack eggs with a touch of a button. A utensil clip Amazon \nSince you can attach these utensil clips to any pot or pan and keep whatever spatula or serving spoon you're cooking with close by. You'll wonder how you ever cooked without it. A salad station Amazon \nThe mess a small salad can make is truly mind-boggling. With several interchangeable blades, this device offers an hassle-free way to make an elaborate salad with minimal clean-up afterward. A MasterPan Amazon \nWith five built-in compartments, MasterPan's skillet allows you to simultaneously cook and season all of your meal's contents, including meat, without cross-contaminating your ingredients. Despite its large size, the pan heats each compartment quickly and evenly.
