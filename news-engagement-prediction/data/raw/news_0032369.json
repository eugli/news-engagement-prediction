Absolutely,” the professor said. “He was great too, but she was better.” \n“She could easily be president, but I don’t think she will,” Ogletree added, to the dismay of millions on the right. \nMichelle is not too fond of politics according to the former president, who once said she told him it was “just a big mess.” \nSomething tells me Barack might cry himself to sleep tonight. \nOh, well. He made America cry for eight straight years. \nThe scary thought here is what if Michelle decides to run for office in the near future? \nAnother Obama in politics sounds terrifying.
