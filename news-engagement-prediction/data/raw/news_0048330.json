That's according to BBC Sport , with the goalkeeper pictured eating the pie in the 83rd minute of the match.

I think a few mates and a few of the fans [placed bets].\" The reserve goalkeeper said he was made aware of the promotion earlier in the day, and he said to those who told him that he \"might give it a go later on.\" He decided during the match to go ahead with it: \"I thought I would give them a bit of banter and let's do it. All the subs were on and we were 2-0 down.\" Shaw explained himself further to ITV News Meridian: ITV News Meridian @itvmeridian 2/21/2017, 2:23:52 PM Per BBC Sport, Sutton manager Paul Doswell commented on it after the match, saying: \" I don't think it shows us in the best light.\" Meanwhile, club chairman Bruce Elliott told BBC Radio 5 live \"we will soon bring him back down to earth.\" Club staff —including players and coaches —and match officials are forbidden from placing any football-related bets after a global ban was introduced in 2014, nor are they allowed to relay any \"inside information\" that others can use for gambling. Despite not making it onto the pitch, the 46-year-old was a busy man during the match, as shown by BBC Sport's Chris Slegg: Chris Slegg @ChrisSlegg 2/20/2017, 9:25:40 PM Shaw first caught the media's attention earlier in the competition when Sutton shocked Leeds United in the fourth round. On Tuesday morning, after the Arsenal match, he appeared on Good Morning Britain in an interview with Piers Morgan. The goalkeeper has also been given a rather unusual offer in recent weeks: Bleacher Report UK @br_uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:42:21.133+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
