(Gray reels away in celebration following his brilliant solo goal) \nLeicester and Derby were leveled one-a-piece heading into extra-time, though goals from Wilfried Ndidi and Gray secured the win. \nAnd both goals were stunning. From Ndidi's long-range piledriver to Gray's mazy run and goal. \nGray skipped past Keogh and Vydra inside the box before smashing the ball into the top corner.
