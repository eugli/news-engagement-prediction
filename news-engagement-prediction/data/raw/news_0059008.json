Karachi   8:18 pm Sharjeel Khan remains the only batsman to have scored a century in the Pakistan Super League T20 event. (Source: File) \nPakistan’s national team batsmen, Sharjeel Khan and Khalid Latif have denied any involvement in spot-fixing during the Pakistan Super League (PSL) in their initial response to the showcause notice issued to them by the Pakistan Cricket Board. \nThe two have been charge-sheeted by the board after being suspended under the PCB’s anti-corruption code and being sent back home from Dubai during the PSL. \nSeveral charges have been levelled against them including having contacts with bookmakers and trying to spot-fix in matches. \nBut sources close to the two players said they had through their lawyers denied all charges. \n“The two have said that they met with one person named Yousuf on the request of former Pakistan opener Nasir Jamshed,” one source told PTI. \n“They have said that they only went to meet with Yousuf considering him a fan but when he made offers to them they walked away,” the source said. \nSince the two didn’t report the offers to the PCB’s Anti-Corruption Unit they are liable to be charged as the code of conduct carries penalities for not reporting an approach. \nThe PCB after receiving their detailed replies will move to set up a three-member tribunal which will then hold hearings to decide on the case. The tribunal will be headed by a Judge. \nPakistani cricket fans have been disappointed after learning about Sharjeel’s suspension under the anti-corruption code as the left-handed opener had cemented his place in all three formats as a hard-hitting batsman. \nThe Hyderabad based batter scored three half-centuries in the one-day series in Australia and also scored 39 in his Test debut in the third Test at Sydney. He remains the only batsman to have scored a century in the Pakistan Super League T20 event. \nKhalid Latif, who hails from Karachi, had also cemented his place in the national T20 side since last year. \n“I have denied any involvement in any wrong doing as I \nhave done nothing wrong,” Sharjeel told PTI. \n“I can never do anything that will bring a bad name to my country. \n“The PCB has told us not to speak to the media but the truth will come out eventually,” he added.
