Here are the possible scenarios india Updated: Feb 23, 2017 08:34 IST Mumbai, Hindustan Times Officials gear up for the election process in Mumbai. (PTI FIle) \nAll eyes are on the outcome of the fiercely-fought Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation elections, as counting for polls to 10 municipal corporations and 25 zilla parishads across Maharashtra begins Thursday morning. \nMumbai turned out in large numbers to vote in Tuesday’s civic polls in areas dominated by the Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). But this does not give either party an edge over the other. In fact, what lies ahead is a tough fight between the friends-turned-foes. \nThe increase in the percentage of voter turnout as compared to the 2012 BMC polls is also not an indicator of a clear trend. Reason: The voters’ list has been substantially downsized since 2012. Although the voter turnout jumped to 55.53%, as compared to 44.75 % in 2012, the voters’ list shrunk to 91.8 lakh from 1.02 crore. The actual number of voters this election were just 4.94 lakh more than in 2012.

But in this case, with the absolute number of voters having barely changed, anti-incumbency is definitely not the case.” \nHe said with the fight being cutthroat and one of prestige for both the Sena and the BJP, both parties tried to mobilise their cadre to ensure every voter in their respective strongholds, even the reluctant ones, are made to vote. “This may have resulted in the highest spike in the wards dominated by both parties,” Pawar said. \nHT looks at four possible scenarios that could play out after the results for the country’s richest civic body are announced: \nSENA, BJP MAKE A COMEBACK FOR ‘THE GOOD OF MUMBAI’ \nThe polarised poll battle in the city between the Shiv Sena and the BJP and the predictions of the exit polls points to a close contest between the saffron allies. In such a scenario, if both parties get similar tallies, there may be little choice but to have a post-poll alliance. In such a scenario, the name-calling and slandering will be left behind for the ‘greater good’. Like in the KDMC, the allies will share the mayors’ post for two-and-a-half years each and come out with a common minimum programme to whitewash the high octane differences during the campaign.

In such a scenario, it will get smaller parties, independents on its side. This will also lead to a situation where the Sena-BJP will be allies in the state and the Centre, but opponents in the BMC. \nBJP’S DEVELOPMENT AGENDA SCORES OVER SENA \nIf the high voter turnout is really a vote for change and the BJP’s winning streak continues, it may emerge as the single-largest party in the Mumbai civic body. If the party manages a three-fold jump in its existing tally of 31 corporators, it will try to grab power in the BMC on its own. The party has some understanding with independent candidates already, who can join it immediately post polls. It will also try and get support of smaller parties like the MNS and the NCP. \nSENA LEADS IN BMC AND TAKES TACIT SUPPORT OF CONGRESS \nIf one goes with the assumption of a close contest between the saffron allies, there is a likelihood that other parties, including the Cong, will be marginalised. With all the main parties contesting polls independently, the chance of many independents winning seats also gets diminished. In such a scenario, if the Sena takes the lead and requires support of another party, Cong may agree to give tacit support by abstaining from voting to widen the divide between the Sena and the BJP.
