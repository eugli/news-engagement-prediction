We're used to over-the-top ads that clearly cost loads of money, but hair care brand It's A 10's commercial during Super Bowl 51 made a statement through simple, artful, black and white shots. According to a release sent out by the company, it's the first first-ever indie owned hair care company to run a Super Bowl commercial — and the fact that the brand is female owned only makes it more exciting. \nThe ad opens with a statement that's clearly a dig at the current U.S. President: A voiceover says \"America, we're in for at least four years of awful hair.
