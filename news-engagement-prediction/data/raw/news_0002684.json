(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) (Photo: The Associated Press) \nSTANFORD, Calif. (AP) — Tara VanDerveer became just the second NCAA women's coach to reach 1,000 career victories Friday night, when No. 8 Stanford beat USC 58-42 to give the Hall of Famer a major milestone to share with the home crowd at Maples Pavilion. \nVanDerveer joined the late Pat Summitt, a dear friend who died last summer from early-onset Alzheimer's disease with 1,098 wins to her name, as the only other women's coach in the elite club. Duke's Mike Krzyzewski is the only Division I men's coach with 1,000. \nIn her 38th season as a head coach and 31st on The Farm after previous stops at Idaho and Ohio State, VanDerveer had former stars like Jennifer Azzi, one of her first marquee recruits, among the 4,490 fans in attendance and perhaps the biggest of all in 89-year-old mother, Rita. \nVanDerveer almost didn't accept the Stanford job all those years ago, unsure she could turn the Cardinal program into a perennial powerhouse. Instead, she has groomed so many future WNBA stars while doing so with class and humility. She has adapted by changing offenses multiple times to best fit her roster. \nMore than anything, she loves her players — and you bet she still loves winning and all the work and preparation it takes to do so. \nKarlie Samuelson made three second-half 3-pointers on the way to 21 points while Erica McCall added 18 points in Stanford's seventh straight victory, an unbeaten run that included last Sunday's win at Washington. Brittany McPhee contributed 10 points for the Cardinal (20-3, 10-1 Pac-12). \nKristen Simon led cold-shooting USC (12-10, 3-8) with 11 points. \nWith a pair of NCAA titles in 1990 and '92, an Olympic gold medal at the 1996 Atlanta Games and 11 Final Four berths — including five straight from 2008-2012 — VanDerveer has meant so much to women's basketball on the court and far beyond it as a positive influence and mentor to so many. \nThe 63-year-old VanDerveer did this one in front of the home fans at Maples Pavilion, after winning No. 800 against Azzi at the University of San Francisco in December 2010 and her 900th in November 2013 at a Thanksgiving tournament in Mexico. Former Stanford star Ros Gold-Onwude, the Golden State Warriors' sideline reporter, called Friday's game for TV. \n\"On behalf of the Pac-12, I would like to congratulate Coach VanDerveer on the amazing and rare accomplishment of 1,000 wins,\" Commissioner Larry Scott said. \"In a career full of astounding successes, this feat is a true testament to her steadfast commitment to excellence at Stanford and her lasting legacy on the entire sport of basketball.\" \nAnd, she certainly plans for many more wins — in fact, some of her former players believe she could take a crack at 2,000. \n\"She very well could,\" athletic director Bernard Muir said Friday, \"it wouldn't shock me.\" \nCONGRATS POUR IN \nFormer Stanford star Nicole Powell now coaches on the Oregon staff, so she still sees VanDerveer occasionally from the other bench. \n\"It's incredible what Tara has accomplished — the consistency of winning year in and year out over the course of her career is truly special,\" Powell wrote in an email. \"She's stayed true to herself, leading in her own unique way and all while evolving in her approach to the game, yet never getting away from her core values. It's hard to capture what she means to women's basketball. I've encountered so many people that seem to have a favorite 'Tara' or 'Stanford Women's basketball' moment that runs the gamut from the '90s up until now. I think that speaks volumes.\" \nBIG PICTURE \nUSC: After sweeping the Arizona schools last weekend, the Trojans missed out on a fourth victory against a ranked opponent this season. Sadie Edwards, averaging 11 points coming into the matchup, went 0 for 8. \nStanford: The Cardinal won their 15th in a row against USC at Maples. \nUP NEXT \nUSC: At California on Sunday. \nStanford: Hosts No. 13 UCLA on Monday night. \n___ \nMore AP college basketball: www.collegebasketball.ap.org and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 1 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.
