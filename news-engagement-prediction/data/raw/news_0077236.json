She is returning to India next month and we chatted with the multiple-time Grammy-nominated musician ahead of her visit, which will include Bengaluru.\n'My latest album is something I wrote in response to the current refugee crisis. It is my anger, outrage and pain that are expressed through music. But it also ends on an optimistic note, because you know I'm hoping for peace, eventually,' she says.\nAnoushka believes that music can take inspiration from people and their journeys and can be a catalyst to inspire. Quiz her on how music and lyrics form legendary work that can bring about change, like those of Nobel Prize-winning songwriter Bob Dylan , and she replies, 'Art is one area in which people realize the growth and evolution they can see from learning from each other. It usually teaches open-mindedness and respect for other cultures. And increasingly, the world around us seems to be closing down.'\nShe's excited to be touring India again this year and says that she is bringing her kids along too, while her husband might be busy with other commitments. About the shows in India, she says, 'Every show will be a little different. I'm looking forward to seeing how people will see and react to the music when I play live in India, especially Bengaluru.' The singer reminisces about the city being special since her last concert with her father in India was here.\nAbout Indian music, Anoushka says that she is happy with the way there are newer sounds and tunes coming into it. 'I follow the Indian music scene to some extent ' not too much, but I keep my eyes open for new and interesting music. Overall, I see that there is a lot more variety being given right now and I think that is really great that they are opening it up beyond the film music.'\nWhile Anoushka doesn't mind composing for Bollywood films someday, she says she isn't looking for it keenly, as such. 'I don't have a desire to work in films as a flat ambition. But if there is a particular film, with a particular maker, with a particular story, then I would love to do it. I don't want to do it for the sake of it. But that's like anything; for example, I don't want to collaborate with just any known pop star unless I have the need for it. But there are many mainstream pop stars that I like respect and would love to work with, but that totally depends on the authentic desire. I approach my work with a sense of integrity, with everything having to be as authentic and real to who I am. If it comes from that place, it doesn't matter what it is or who it is ' I'd just do it.' While talking about films, she also lets slip the information that she will be composing for a film in the west. 'I do have some composition work for a British film that is happening next year in London,' Anoushka reveals on a parting note.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T16:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:50:04.726+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
