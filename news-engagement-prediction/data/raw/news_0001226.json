Poitras depicts herself in the red dress, symbolizing missing and murdered Indigenous women. (Kendall Latimer/CBC)\n​ Poitras is an artist from the Muscowpetung First Nation. Her first ever art piece, a traditional women's yoke — which is a type of cape — will be part of an exhibit which opens up Wednesday night at the First Nations University of Canada.\nThe exhibit is titled  The Next 150  and is part of the Storytellers Festival held by Sâkêwêwak Artists' Collective.\nThe piece is deeply personal for Poitras, as she says it is a depiction of Poitras and her partner. Poitras is depicted as a pregnant woman and wearing a red dress, symbolizing missing and murdered Indigenous women. Her partner is depicted in traditional Metis regalia. Though she is not pregnant, Poitras said that is something she and her partner want in the future. \n\"I made her pregnant so that people remember that our women are life-givers,\" Poitras said. \nThe two are face to face, entering into marriage. Pride colours are depicted on the earrings of one figure and on an arm band of the other.\n\"Everybody has that ability to love and that's a common ground that everybody can understand.\"\nA story of resiliency The yoke was also made with .40 calibre bullet casings, which Poitras says protects the work and conveys that the relationship between police and Indigenous people needs to improve. (Kendall Latimer / CBC)\nPoitras wants the piece to convey a message of resiliency.\nThe piece uses colour as symbolism: red to symbolize blood, gold and green to represent the Earth and minerals, and black and white to represent a contrast in society.\n\"We believe that the contraries in society, they're there to protect us and they're there to correct us,\" Poitras said of the Dakota teachings she has picked up.\nPoitras says there is a message in every detail. Pink symbolizes flesh.\n\"So many people sacrifice so much in order to gain,\" she said. \n\"I feel like our Indigenous people have sacrificed so much already and we compromise a lot of our culture, and our language ... to accustom ideologies that aren't ours. So, a lot of it wasn't just something we purposely sacrificed, it was forced.\"​\nThe exhibit opens at First Nations University of Canada at 6 p.m. CST and runs until Mar. 31.\n\n\nWith files from CBC Radio's The Morning Edition and Kendall Latimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T00:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:34:10.132+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
