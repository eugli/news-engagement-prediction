'The club needs a reality check, Hamann said while speaking to the Paddy Power blog. 'Part of the problem at Liverpool is that, because the club creates so much interest all over the world, people still seem to think that they’re still one of the driving forces in Europe – which they’re not. Hamann also insisted players and staff at the club believe their own hype too easily LIVERPOOL RESULTS IN 2017 Jan 2: Sunderland 2-2 Liverpool (Premier League) Jan 8: Liverpool 0-0 Plymouth (FA Cup) Jan 11: Southampton 1-0 Liverpool (EFL Cup) Jan 15: Manchester United 1-1 Liverpool (Premier League) Jan 18: Plymouth 0-1 Liverpool (FA Cup) Jan 21: Liverpool 2-3 Swansea (Premier League) Jan 25: Liverpool 0-1 Southampton (EFL Cup) Jan 28: Liverpool 1-2 Wolverhampton Wanderers (FA Cup) Jan 31: Liverpool 1-1 Chelsea (Premier League) Feb 4: Hull 2-0 Liverpool (Premier League) 'I think that’s the biggest problem is where people within the club, and I include the players, perceive the club to be and where they actually are - because there’s a huge gap. This is what the manager is fighting now, to change the mentality not only in the team, but in the whole club. 'Everyone needs to work 100 per cent harder to get Liverpool back to where they were. The reason the club still creates interest is because the guys in the 70s and 80s were unbeatable. 'That’s got nothing to do with the current crop of players and what’s happened in the last eight to 10 years. If you look at the facts of that period it’s been pretty dire. Next up for Klopp and his stuttering side is a Premier League clash against Tottenham 'I’m not saying the owners didn’t back Jurgen Klopp, because he got some money to spend, but the mindset within the club needs to change. That filters down to the team. They’ve had some fantastic performances, but then they get beat by Hull and Burnley. Sometimes the club and the team believe in their own hype. 'You’ve got to be consistent, I don’t care whether you go 10 or 20 games without losing. If you don’t finish in the top four and you’ve got no trophy to show at the end of it, it’s a disappointing season if you’re Liverpool full stop.' Liverpool's bid to get back to winning ways in the Premier League sees them take on Tottenham this weekend, with games against Leicester and Arsenal on the horizon.
