The official added there is “no [transition] process as such”. \nLaunched in 2010 as a pilot project, CBSE-i stems from the main CBSE with an added focus on an “internationally benchmarked curriculum”. It had espoused dedicated classrooms, syllabus and staff for teaching the course, which is based on the main CBSE curriculum.\nA leading academic from a popular Indian school in the UAE that used to offer CBSE-i, said: “CBSE-i didn’t take off when it was launched, because the right content wasn’t there. That created a vacuum where some of the boards did not recognise it. They were giving CBSE certificates when, technically, it should have been CBSE-i certificates.”\nThe academic, who did not want to be named, added: “I think the issue has been corrected now, because if something isn’t working, it should be discontinued. Ultimately, the content, and the infrastructure for the content, wasn’t there. The CBSE’s content comes from the NCERT [National Council for Educational Research and Training] but CBSE was sort of making its own content for CBSE-i, ‘in house’. But it didn’t develop well enough.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T03:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:34:04.780+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
