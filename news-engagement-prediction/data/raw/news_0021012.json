Photo: Supplied \n\"I had a bread roll in one hand and I was ready for lunch when I saw this worm thing come out of one of the sausages. It didn't like the heat and it was squirming everywhere trying to get away,\" he said. \nA DIY autopsy on the grub revealed a belly full of smaller maggots, according to Mr Wood.
