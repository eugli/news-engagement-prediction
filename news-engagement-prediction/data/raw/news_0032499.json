Advertisement \nThe government said the regime should also include mandatory life bans as well as increased jail terms for live baiting, registration of greyhounds for their entire lives, and more resources for enforcement, prosecution and animal welfare. \nFairfax Media revealed just days after Mr Baird's announcement that a dispute had erupted over the reform plan in relation to an industry offer to cap breeding of greyhounds for racing at 2000 a year. \nThe chief executive of the NSW Greyhound Industry Racing Alliance, Brenton Scott, told the panel at its first meeting that he had reached agreement with the government that the 2000 figure be scrapped. \nHowever, the government insisted there was no agreement reached and that the cap would remain in place under any reform plan. \nMr Baird announced the plan to close the greyhound racing industry after a special commission of inquiry report found 68,000 greyhounds had been euthanised in the past 12 years because they could not race, or were too slow. \nHe backed down in the face of immense pressure from the opposition, media outlets and the industry.
