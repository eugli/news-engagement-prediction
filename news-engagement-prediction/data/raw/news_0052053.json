EPA Theresa May will be happy with the latest growth figures \nBritish manufacturers boosted the economy more than had previously been thought. \nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that for the three months up to December, previous estimates that the economy had grown by 0.6 per cent were revised up. And the weaker pound after Brexit pushed exports again too. \nHowever, the GDP growth for 2016 was put down slightly from two per cent to 1.8 per cent on the back of weaker exports in the first half of the year. PA:Press Association 3 Mrs May visited the Conservative candidate in Stoke in a pottery warehouse ahead of Thursday’s vote \nDespite the vote to leave the EU the economy remained strong, although there was a slight dip in business investment. \nThe ONS said Germany just pipped us to the post to be the fastest growing economy in the G7 – it grew by 1.9 per cent compared to our 1.8 per cent. \n“Excluding oil and gas output, estimated UK GDP growth might actually have been revised up in 2016,” PwC’s chief economist John Hawksworth said.
