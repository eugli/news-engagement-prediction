The Romneys offered $1.4 billion for the Marlins, the report said, but with that deal apparently gone awry, they are looking to become part-owners of the Yankees. How much stake of the team they’re looking into is unclear. \nThe Romneys also reportedly tried to buy the Dodgers — who briefly employed Tagg as an executive — but they ended up being sold to the Guggenheim partners in 2012. \nOne odd side note: Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, is a Red Sox fan. But that didn’t stop him from investing in the Yankees in 2007 , and now he’s trying to own a piece of them, too.
