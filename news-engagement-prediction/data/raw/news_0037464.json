Nover announced his retirement via Instagram . The 33-year-old Brooklyn native had lost three straight in the Octagon, including a split-decision defeat to Rick Glenn at UFC 208 last weekend. “I want to thank the UFC, Dana White, and Sean Shelby for giving me a second chance at my dreams as fighter,” he wrote. “I'm officially retiring from MMA. A big thanks to my teammates and coaches over the years, as well as my supportive family and friends. I'll be moving on to focus on many other things in my life. It was an amazing run and I'm glad I tried my best at it.” A cast member on “The Ultimate Fighter 8,” Nover went 1-6 over the course of two separate Octagon stints, with his lone triumph coming over Yui Chul Nam at UFC Fight Night 66 in May 2015. He also went 2-1 competing under the Bellator MMA banner. Nover exits the sport with an 11-8-1 career mark. I'll be starting school for my masters degree to become a Nurse Practitioner. Time to focus on my future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T05:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T02:28:13.486+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
