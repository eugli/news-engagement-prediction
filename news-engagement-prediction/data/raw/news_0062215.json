Written by Kriti Sonali | New Delhi | Updated: February 23, 2017 5:50 pm Baywatch’s new poster, which is a character poster of Priyanka Chopra in the film, has been shared by the actor. \nPriyanka Chopra is playing a villain in Baywatch and what a fantastic, can-kill-you-with-my-looks villain she plays! After a long, long time, this actor seems to be ready to get her hands dirty and it appears Hollywood offered her just the platform with the character of Victoria Leeds. In the film, she plays the destroyer of bromances and the single biggest threat to the beach. \nBaywatch’s new poster, which is a character poster of Priyanka Chopra in the film, has been shared by the actor, with the caption, “Being bad can be so good.. presenting #VictoriaLeeds #Baywatch #may26.” \nMore from the world of Entertainment: \n\nOur only grouse with her being the bad guy is that we won’t see her in lifeguard’s red bikini. While in the earlier stills of Priyanka, we saw her in white, the new poster shows her in a hot red avatar and she looks gorgeous in an off-shoulder dress. But, alas, it is not a bikini. \nWatch Priyanka Chopra’s new Baywatch poster: \n\nPriyanka seems to be all excited to play this negative role as the actor believes and has said time and again that being bad is ‘so good’ for her. \nAlso read| Deepika Padukone, Priyanka Chopra will attend Oscars 2017?
