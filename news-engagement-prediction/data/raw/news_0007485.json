Is it \"T-Shirt\"? \"Bad and Boujee\"? Or all of the above? \nIt began with the greatest moment in the history of American cinema, the \"T-Shirt\" video . That prompted a simple question heard 'round the office: Was this the best Migos song ever? On one hand, it obviously was, due to the fact that it was awesome and a Migos song and seriously did you hear Quavo's verse? On the other hand, isn't every Migos song the best Migos song? To settle this question, we asked more than two dozen VICE and Noisey staffers, friends, artists, DJs, and writers to weigh in on the most important question of our time. This is what they said: The Best Migos Song Is: \"FEMA\" \nHURRICANE WRIST — Gregory \"Beef\" Jones , VICELAND producer The Best Migos Song Is: \"T-Shirt\" \nThis may be a little too early to call, but I don't think any Migos song has moved me the way \"T-Shirt\" has. I honestly haven't stopped playing it since the video came out. This is peak Migos we're hearing right now. From the ad-libs to the verses to the visuals—they're in full form at the moment. People counted them out, and they're back and better than ever. They somehow unlocked that other 90 percent of their brains. I have to tip my hat. — Andrew Barber , owner and founder of Fake Shore Drive \nIt sounds like Christ's redeeming love. — Alex Hancock , writer \nThe best Migos song is \"T-Shirt\" because, even though \"Bad & Boujee\" is the song on the world's radar right now, \"T-Shirt\" provided the cultural moment that shifted everything: five minutes of Quavo, Offset, and Takeoff dancing around a snowy cliffs in the forest among gigantic mountains. Name a more iconic five minutes. While you try to do that, I'll try to think of something else to write about how incredible this song is OK both of these tasks have been proven impossible. \"T-Shirt\" is perfect. — Eric Sundermann , Noisey Editor-in-Chief \nChoosing the best Migos song is like choosing your favorite child... in that it's extremely easy. You pick the best looking. So, since \"T-Shirt\" is their best music video, that's what I'm going with. Also, speaking of children, I'm currently babysitting my infant niece, and when I asked what her favorite Migos song was she drooled on her shirt, which I took as confirmation. What's more, the song contains a very important message that I hope my sister imparts on her daughter: \"Mama told me not to sell work\". I'm not certain that the Migos heeded their mom's advice about not dealing drugs, but I hope my my niece does. My sister is going to hate that I wrote this. — Zach Goldbaum , host of Noisey on VICELAND The Best Migos Song Is: \"John Wick\" \nThe best song by Migos is by far \"John Wick\" (yes it is based entirely off of the action movie starring Keanu Reeves). It missed a lot of people somehow, but in my opinion it's an eternally good listen. It has everything: bowel-quaking bass, movie spoilers, and the Migos' most heart warming ad-lib, \"MOMMA.\" — Zack Fox , writer and artist The Best Migos Song Is: \"YRH\" feat. Rich Homie Quan \n\"YRH\" features all Migos rapping hard as shit, multigenerational cultural references (Jett Jackson, Cassius Clay, Master P, Tookie Williams, Lil Boosie), a bangin beat from Metro and TM88, and, most importantly, listening to it makes me want to kick down a brick wall wearing designer sneakers while beautiful women spray bottle of Dom behind me, all in slow motion. The Best Migos Song Is: \"Cross the Country\" \nYO CROSS THE COUNTRY IS THE BEST MIGOS SONG BECAUSE OFFSET VERSE ON THERE IS STRAIGHT CRILZ FIRE FLAMEBINI… MY GUY ADLIBS ON THE SHIT ARE ART B LIKE THEY GOTTA TEACH OFFSET'S VERSE IN SCHOOL DURING DEVELOPMENTAL YEARS JUUHEAR — The Kid Mero , host of \"Desus and Mero\" on VICELAND The Best Migos Song Is: \"Young Nigga\" by Que feat. Sonny Digital \nIt's really hard for me to pick what I would consider to be the absolute best Migos song, but a favorite of mine that instantly comes to mind is 2013's \"Young Nigga\" with Que and Sonny Digital. This was the record that put me on to Migos right before they dropped their Y.R.N. mixtape and I've had it in constant rotation since. This shit still goes. — Ty Howard , Fake Shore Drive staff writer/Shade 45 DJ The Best Migos Song Is: \"Dennis Rodman\" feat. Gucci Mane \nIt was far too hard to choose my favorite Migos track; the list of bangers is staggering. I mean, how can you pick between \"Pipe It Up\" and \"Hannah Montana\" or even \"T- Shirt\"? They keep get better and better! Anyways, I felt I may as well shine the light on a track that got me hooked early on. \"Dennis Rodman\" (feat. Gucci Mane) was that one. I think I liked it based on the title alone. I didn't even need to hear it. But how they flipped an entire song solely on the concept of girls changing their hair color like Rodman?!?! h. It's fire! \"Ridin' round smoking OG stank / switch your hair up like you rob banks / your hair matching my drank\" Truly a masterpiece. The Best Migos Song Is: \"Trophies\" (Remix) \nReleased on December 30, 2013, \"Trophies (Remix)\" is the best Migos song. Here's why: \n1. The fact that this is technically a Drake song, but the best version of this available on the internet does not even mention that Drake exists in relation to this song. Migos secretly took this song from him, after he attempted to do the same on \"Versace.\" This is why this song never appeared on a Drake project, and instead appeared on the second Young Money comp, sans Migos.3. Scientists say that this is the beat you hear as you strut into heaven.4. I know it's cool to hate Drake now, but damn, listen to him on this.5. \"Man, this shit is not a love song\"—Drake, every single song since this song came out.6. \"I'm celebrating with my family\"—this is the modern day \" Family Affair.\" 7. \"I want a Grammy\"8. Quavo's verse on this short, but the entire thing is Instagram caption worthy.9. \"At the top right now I wanna order up a million bottles.\"10. The fact that somehow Takeoff says every possible syllabic sound a human voice can make in the matter of three seconds.11. \"Tryna fuck me a Rihanna.\"—Takeoff is accepting of any and all possible Rihannas in the multiverse.12. The fact that Takeoff says every word in the dictionary in two seconds at the end of his verse, but those words mashed together sound like \"bricks in the kitchen.\"13. This is one of Offset's first songs after he got out of jail in 2013. He sat dormant while Migos blew the fuck up in mid-2013, and then hit their songs ungodly hard till he was locked up again. Quavo and Takeoff basically clear the runway for Offset to go the fuck off on this. Without this, we don't get \"Bitch I'm a dog, woof (g ).\"14. \"Got the Mac-11 call it macaroni\"15. \"Sittin' at home I was contemplating, changing and switch up my situation, tryna see the bigger picture.\"16. \"No it ain't no money issue, grant all my momma's wishes.\"17. Takeoff 202017.5. The beat riding out represents — Andrew Winistorfer , Vinyl Me, Please Senior Editor The Best Migos Song Is: \"Freestyle\" feat. Young Thug \n\"Freestyle\" is an oft-forgot deep cut from Streets on Lock III , but it is notable for featuring arguably both one of Young Thug's greatest verses and one of Offset's greatest verses. \"I got the white call it Pamela... Anderson / White Lambo, Jennifer Aniston\" is everything a rap couplet should be. The slow-rolling strings serve as the perfect backing for the triplet flow, and everyone finds their pocket. It's a flawless track. — Bauce Sauce , writer The Best Migos Song Is: \"Bando\" \nThe best Migos track is \"Bando\" because what other rappers could make selling drugs out of an abandoned property over a beat with a flute sound so whimsical? — Desus Nice , host of \"Desus and Mero\" on VICELAND \nDefinitely \"Bando.\" Shit sounds like Yoshi's inner monologue. — Alex Russell , writer \nThis is my favorite song to date because it was the first song that I discovered from the guys. I remember feeling something instantly when I pressed play. The production... I felt something. It sounded so vintage... so southern. It was on repeat my whole trip to SXSW that year. — Diane \"Shabazz\" Varnie , founder of Electric Circus The Best Migos Song Is: \"Trouble\" \nOnce my kickboxing teacher played \"Trouble\" during an attack round and it banged so hard that every time I feel kinda rowdy I think about the hook THEY DONT WANT NO TROUBLE and it makes me happy. — Jenna Wortham , New York Times Magazine staff writer The Best Migos Song Is: \"Birds\" \n\"Slippery\" just dropped, so it's too soon to say that one. \"Holmes\" maybe, but that doesn't have Offset on it. I'll go with \"Birds\" then, but it could also be \"Sloppy Toppy.\" Please never ask me to do something like this again, thanks. — Trey Smith , VICE.com social producer \n\"Birds\" is obviously the Migos' greatest opus for several reasons. Firstly, the trap symphony begins with audio of a serene squandering of eagles, masterfully and abruptly interrupted by Stack Boy Twan's producer tag demanding he turn the beat down. He shall not; nor shall we. Then, Quavo gracefully soars in on the chorus, exhibiting early on his knack for melody and ability to craft infectious hooks. Thirdly, Quavo actually provides us with a full-on bird \"trill\" as one of the chorus' main ad-libs. I cannot recall either of the members of NSYNC ever giving us bird calls or sounds in ANY of their supposed hits. Lastly, the song is just hard as fuck, and it hit right after the Migos' wrist-generated hurricane hit land with \"Versace\" and their YRN tape, thus its timestamp will also be remembered. \"Birds\" is one of those sleeper hits that appreciates throughout an Artist's career, and to this day, it is still in rotation around these parts, in Dallas traps, college parties, nightclubs, and stripclubs. — Mel of The Outfit, TX , rapper The Best Migos Song Is: \"Fight Night\" \nThis is the hardest question of all time, seeing as that the Migos have only gotten better with time. If I have to choose one Migos song to listen to for the rest of my life, it probably would be \"Fight Night.\" Anytime I hear it, I feel inclined to jig. — Kari Faux , rapper \nThis is a trick question because every song is the best Migos song. But if I have to pick one, it's gotta be \"Fight Night.\" It's the song that gets me the most hyped up. It's got a killer beat, plenty of great quotables, and if I were a professional athlete, it would 100 percent be my walkup song. The Best Migos Song Is: \"Bad and Boujee\" \nIt's low key impossible to picc just one Migo record. To me. Every song they make feel like a legit hit. I say the best Migo song is the next Migo song 'cause they shxt only get more lit every time they drop. But if I just gotta picc one, Bad & Bougie the littest record in the world right now so thas my picc. — Cuz Lightyear , rapper \nMan, my favorite Migos song gotta be—I usually run away from hype, but it's the most turnt song right now: \"Bad & Boujee.\" I just can't get over it—all the way from the beat, all the way to the verses, all the way to the hook, you know what I'm saying? That song doesn't get old. But also, me and Migos did a song called \"Whippin' a Brick.\" We can go for days on Migos songs; they got hits for days. But \"Bad & Boujee\" is my shit. We've also got some stuff that the world don't know about yet but they gonna know about it real soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T00:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T01:46:34.498+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
