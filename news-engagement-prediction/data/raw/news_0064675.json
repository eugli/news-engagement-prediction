I'm sure nobody else does.\n\"I've talked to a few neighbours,\" said Black. \"They are not too happy about it either.\"\nLocal improvement levy Black, 29, says he learned after buying his house that the town was able to apply a \"local improvement levy\" on homeowners to recover some of the cost of the work.\nRiverview wants to charge residents of Wentworth Drive a local improvement levy to upgrade the watermain, sewer, street and curbing in the neighbourhood, with the residents charged $115 per metre of road street frontage.

I think it's just crazy.\"\nStrong opposition needed to avoid There is one way out. In the letter, signed by town clerk Annette Crummey, residents are told they can avoid the bill if they reject the improvements to their street in great enough numbers.\nShe writes, if \"a majority of the owners whose combined property values equal at least one half of all the properties to be assessed, petition council against the work by March 7, 2017.\"\nRiverview Mayor Ann Seamans said there is nothing unusual about the Wentworth Drive improvements.\nNothing unusual \"We do this with all local improvements — we charge,\" she said. \"With the Municipalities Act, it allows municipalities to undertake the provisions of sewage, sidewalks, roads and streets and water improvements and cover the cost from the owners of the properties.\n\"They will be charged for the curb and gutter, not for the whole project, but the curb and gutter in front of their homes. This is the way it's been done for years.\"\nSeamans said people are allowed to petition against the levy at the council meeting on March 7, but that would mean no improvements will be made to the street, she said.\nSeamans said people are given payment options to pay the levy right away or over a period of time, or they can put a lien against their house.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T00:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:43:35.739+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
