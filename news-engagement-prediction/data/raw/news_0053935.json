(Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nLGBT proponents in the entertainment world are using social media to register their disappointment about Wednesday's decision to roll back federal protection for transgender students granted under the Obama administration. Now it will be up to states to decide whether trans students may use the restroom that matches their chosen gender rather than their birth gender. \nAt least that will be the case until April, when the case of Gavin Grimm , a Virginia high school student who identifies as male, comes before the Supreme Court. Should the high court rule in his favor, it could set a national standard for trans rights. (His case is the one that Laverne Cox, transgender star of Netflix's Orange Is the New Black and CBS' Doubt , urged Grammy Awards viewers to research.) \nPerhaps the most notable entry was from Jackie Evancho, the America's Got Talent runner-up who sang the national anthem at President Trump's inauguration last month. This issue is deeply personal for her: Her older sister Juliet came out as trans in 2015 . \n\"I am obviously disappointed in the @POTUS decision to send the #transgender bathroom issue to the states to decide,\" she acknowledged on Twitter , before addressing the Trump directly with a plea: \"U gave me the honor 2 sing at your inauguration. Pls give me & my sis the honor 2 meet with u 2 talk #Transgender rights.\" . @realDonaldTrump u gave me the honor 2 sing at your inauguration. Pls give me & my sis the honor 2 meet with u 2 talk #transgender rghts ❤ — jackie evancho (@jackieevancho) February 23, 2017 \nTrans rights are also near and dear to Oscar winner Patricia Arquette , whose sister Alexis transitioned nearly two decades ago and who died last September. \nShe took the \"fight fear with jokes\" approach, noting, \"I spent half my life sharing a bathroom with a #Transgender sister. Trust me there's nothing to be afraid of other than running out of TP.\" I spent half my life sharing a bathroom with a #Transgender sister. Trust me there's nothing to be afraid of other than running out of TP. \nTalk-show host Ellen DeGeneres , who recently disinvited gospel singer Kim Burrell over homophobic comments , wrote, \"This isn’t about politics. It’s about human rights, and it’s not okay.\" Just seeing the news about removing laws protecting trans people. This isn’t about politics. It’s about human rights, and it’s not okay. — Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) February 23, 2017 \nAnd Lost alumnus Dominic Monaghan lamented that life for transgender kids is about to get even rougher. \"As if school life isn't hard enough at times for #transgender students @realDonaldTrump takes away rights for separate bathrooms. Heartless.\" As if school life isn't hard enough at times for #transgender students @realDonaldTrump takes away rights for separate bathrooms. Heartless. — Dominic Monaghan. (@DomsWildThings) February 23, 2017 \nHis sentiment echoed what Grimm told USA TODAY last year: \"My favorite school activity is leaving school.\" CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2m9Zfb2 NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.
