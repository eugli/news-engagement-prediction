Kim Mulkey   9:46 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 9:46 p.m. ET \nBaylor women's basketball coach Kim Mulkey has apologized for a \"very poor choice of words\" after a game on Saturday. \nAs Baylor continues to deal with the fallout of multiple sexual assault cases and Title IX investigations, Mulkey was making an impassioned statement on why Baylor is a great institution. If parents don't feel safe sending their daughters to the school, Mulkey would \"knock them right in the face,\" he said. \nMORE: Kim Mulkey passionately defends Baylor \n\"I hate that I used the remark about punching them in the face,\" Mulkey said, via ESPN.com . \"That was not literal. I was trying to make a point, to be firm in what you are saying back at them. I'm not a violent person. I apologize for the very poor choice of words.\" \nMulkey said she decided to make the comments after she heard people suggesting to parents that they should not send their daughters to Baylor. According to Mulkey, she took it personally, since her daughter attended Baylor and she felt like it showed female Baylor students in a negative light. \n\"My point was, 'Please don't paint, with a broad brush, the women at Baylor,'\" Mulkey said. \"I didn't think about what I was going to say. I looked at my players, and the little girls and the women who are cheering for them. And I spoke with a lot of emotion.\" \nMulkey said she didn't intend for her remarks to be construed as unsympathetic toward sexual assault victims. \n\"Not only do I sympathize with victims, I am angry about the way victims were treated at this university,\" Mulkey said. \"It is horrible, horrible anytime someone does not take care of a victim. Even one sexual assault is too many. Nobody is dismissing what happened here. I want us to get to the bottom of it.\" \nBaylor's negative attention reached a peak last year when independent law firm Pepper Hamilton released a report saying the university did not handle the allegations of sexual assault on campus properly. \nSeveral of those assaults dealt directly with members of the football team. As a result, head coach Art Briles was fired and university president Ken Starr, athletic director Ian McCaw, and Title IX coordinator Patty Crawford all resigned. \nSeveral lawsuits against the school are ongoing, including one that states 52 rapes on campus were caused by 31 separate members of the football team.
