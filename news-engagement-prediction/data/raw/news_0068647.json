I’m conscious that Arsène Wenger says never re-sign an old player so that’s in my head. I honestly don’t know what I’m going to do. It’s hard to see — but what’s the point of saying never?” GETTY David was beaten to the Labour leadership by his younger brother Ed GETTY Corbyn, like Ed Miliband, rose to the party leadership after a surge of support from party members \nIt comes as questions were raised by Labour MPs over the left-winger’s leadership amid a historic loss in the Copeland by-election to the Conservatives. \nVeteran Labour MP David Winnick urged Corbyn to consider his position following the historic defeat in the Cumbria seat. \nHe said: “The party is faced with the problem of a leader who is simply not acceptable to a large number of people who would normally vote Labour.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T03:36:21.668+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
