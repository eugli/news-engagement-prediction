familiar faces. Or not. \nWhile city officials were still sifting through paperwork late Friday, at least 10 of the 14 council races in the May 6 election will be contested. Two Dallas ISD seats will also feature multiple candidates on the ballot. \nEvery Dallas council member south of the Trinity River has at least one opponent. And some of the races could turn out to be slugfests. \nFormer longtime City Council members Tennell Atkins and Dwaine Caraway are back again after term limits forced them to step aside in 2015. Caraway will have a one-on-one showdown with Carolyn King Arnold, who he helped get elected. A proposed deck park spanning Interstate 35 near the Dallas Zoo will be a hot-button issue in that race. Atkins, meanwhile, will run in a crowded field that includes Deputy Mayor Pro Tem Erik Wilson and 2015 third-place finisher Gail Terrell. \nIn southwestern Dallas, former teacher Joe Tave will get a rematch against council member Casey Thomas after losing by less than 200 votes in the 2015 runoff. \nIn Pleasant Grove, council member Rickey Callahan will seek a third term against lawyer Dominique Torres, who lists prominent Friendship-West Baptist Church's senior pastor Frederick Haynes as her treasurer. \nAnd in South Dallas, Tiffinni Young has five challengers, including her 2015 opponent Kevin Felder and neighborhood activist Tammy Johnston. The campaign will likely focus on the fate of Fair Park and quality of life issues. Dallas council member Tiffinni Young is reflected in a logo of the City of Dallas in a elevator at Dallas City Hall Thursday August 6, 2015. Her district is City Council District 7. (Ron Baselice/The Dallas Morning News) Kevin Felder, a candidate for Dallas City Council District 7. Courtesy Panelists Joe Tave (right) and John H.

Wilson is hoping to win a second term against a crowded field. (Jae S.

Carrillo is running for City Council in West Dallas. Gail Terrell is running for City Council in southeastern Dallas against former City Council member Tennell Atkins and incumbent council member Erik Wilson. \nIn North Dallas, incumbent Lee Kleinman will square off against his neighbor, real estate blogger Candy Evans. While the Dallas Police Association and Dallas Fire Fighters Association has yet to endorse Evans, they've made clear they want Kleinman out. \nMayor Pro Tem Monica Alonzo will have to face a crowded field of contenders in her West Dallas district, where gentrification concerns are on voters' minds. Dallas County Schools board member Omar Narvaez, who has the support of council member Philip Kingston, headlines the field of candidates. \nBut Kingston, who is seeking a third term and is known as an indefatigable campaigner, could be preoccupied in his own backyard. On Friday, he drew a surprise serious challenger: Matthew Wood, a lawyer and East Dallas neighborhood advocate who headed the city's bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics. \nWood already has the endorsements of former Mayor Ron Kirk, lawyer Bobby Abtahi, activists Suzanne Smith and Mita Havlick. Abtahi lost a hard-fought runoff to Kingston in 2013, and Smith had Kingston's endorsement in her campaign for Dallas ISD trustee last year. \nDustin Marshall, the CEO of Hazel's Hot Shot who defeated Havlick and Smith in the Dallas ISD race, is also up for re-election on the Dallas ISD board of trustees. \nMarshall, 39, will face Richard Young, 37, a fourth-grade writing teacher at Dallas Gateway Charter School, and physician assistant Lori Kirkpatrick, 51. Young unsuccessfully ran for the Midlothian ISD board of trustees in 2013. \nDistrict 6 trustee Joyce Foreman, 68, has one opponent in the May election: author and nonprofit founder Phelesha Hamilton, 31. \nStaff writer Corbett Smith contributed to this report.
