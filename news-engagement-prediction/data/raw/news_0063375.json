If that appeals not — or if rejection already has burned — we can profess about that which we know not much (as does David Darlow's Serebryakov), or worry about where we fit in the petty hierarchies into which we organize ourselves, as do almost everyone else on this stage. Or we can just be openly accepting of our decay (like Larry Neumann Jr.'s impoverished and abandoned Waffles). Whatever works. \nFalls' ensemble throws itself into these conundrums with sophisticated textual and human exploration — their creations never unraveling as much as they could, perhaps, but at least showing some of the whites in their eyes. There's always a show to put on. Even if your audience is only yourself. \nBush, who has not worked in Chicago in some years, is especially good in a production that, it is if fair to say, highlights the dilemmas of women more than your average bit o' Chekhov, a combination of the strength and distinctiveness of Bush's performance, especially when she is working in scenes with the utterly transparent Neff, and the orientation of Baker's translation, which Falls guides to make the ineptitude of the provincial male look, well, just a tad more inept. Not that the task is difficult. \nThere is a certain inscrutability to Bush's performance, which, combined with the character's refined quality, puts one in mind of Melania Trump, another woman in a situation about which the curious have many rude questions. And if you want to go to the White House, I'd wager that Falls and Darlow, who is playing the rhetorically confident, much older and happily (for him) incurious spouse of Bush's mysterious Yelena, went to Washington first. But then there are echoes of the Trumps everywhere these days; we on the periphery only can watch and wonder, until we're bored. \nBaker's translation premiered in New York in a simple and theatrical environment, which tended to emphasize its contemporary lilt and orientation. Falls' production (the main designers are Todd Rosenthal, Ana Kuzmanic and Keith Parham) is a more overtly Russian affair — Trumpdom again, fake news notwithstanding — rooted, for sure, in Falls' work in Moscow. But if Rosenthal's once-imposing, now-crumbling house recalls other such edifices in his creative past, Baker's clarity and unpretentiousness works perfectly well in this setting and even helps Falls and his crew avoid the dangers of the Stanislavskian rabbit hole. \nThis \"Uncle Vanya\" is resonant, funny, smart, clear, involving and, if never heartbreaking, consistently poignant. Hopper, who can be inscrutable, nails Vanya's big scene — the one that matters, the one where he realizes that his entire life has been totally pointless. More important yet, he sees he has no choice but to pretend that his realization merely was temporary. \nI've always divided translators of Chekhov into two groups — those who feel real sympathy for his characters and those (mostly British socialists) who subtly want to take the richer ones down, even as they swear not one Russian word was misconstrued. Baker is in the former camp, for sure, especially where the women are concerned. This is a warm translation, but also a remarkably invigorating piece of work that plumbs the existential depths without ever taking itself too seriously. \nIt is said here of Yelena: \"She's just reeling from boredom.\" \nThe line deserves the laugh it got at Tuesday's opening. It's a delicious explication of Chekhov's original Russian because it makes you mull whether Baker has found the perfectly expression of a boredom so boring it could suck out your soul — or if, in fact, she merely has penned an oxymoron. If you can reel from boredom, are you, in fact, then no longer bored? \nAnd if that idea doesn't bore you, you'll enjoy yourself here. \nChris Jones is a Tribune critic. \nTwitter @ChrisJonesTrib \nReview: \"Uncle Vanya\" (3.5 STARS) \nWhen: Through March 19 \nWhere: Goodman's Owen Theatre, 170 N.
