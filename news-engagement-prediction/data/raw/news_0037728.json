The matter had been brought to her notice on Twitter by Dr Lakdawala, who also identifies as a philanthropist and has been proactively raising funds to enable Ahmed's expensive medical treatment. \nThe 36-year-old Ahmed, who weighed about 5 kg when she was born, suddenly started putting on weight when she turned 11. Her condition worsened quickly, leading to multiple health disorders and preventing her from leaving home for the next 25 years. \nIn the interim, Ahmed has suffered a stroke, leading to severe speech impairment, she has diabetes, kidney disorder, hypertension, thyroid malfunction, water retention, obstructive and restrictive lung disease, gout and is at a very high risk of pulmonary embolism. These are only some of the long list of illnesses afflicting this young woman. \nREAD: This Mumbai Hospital Is Spending ₹2 Crore For The Surgery Of The World's Heaviest Woman \nHer arrival in Mumbai had to be meticulously planned too. Since ordinary airlines were not equipped to fly her down, she had to be transported in a cargo plane . At Saifee Hospital, an estimated ₹2 crore was spent on building a separate ward for her to be treated in. The doors, operation theatre, recovery room and all other ancillary departments had to be constructed according to specifications of her weight and size. \nThese months of planning and hard work finally seem to be paying off. In the last 5 days, Ahmed has started losing weight and can lift her arms now. Earlier she was paralysed, partly due to the stroke and also her body weight, and couldn't move freely. After regular physiotherapy sessions, she is able to manoeuvre her arms and blow kisses at the doctors and attendants. However, unused to any form of exercise, she is also easily exhausted, according to a detailed medical bulletin in The Indian Express . \nAhmed is also on a strict 1,200 calorie diet and is being treated for sleeping disorders. Whereas earlier she could only manage about an hour's sleep, now she can rest for several hours at a stretch with the help of a monitoring device. The sores on her back, caused by years of inactivity, are also healing after she was laid on a water mattress, though her vitals are being closely observed by a team of doctors. Reports said Ahmed is keeping herself distracted by watching television and has become a fan of Bollywood star Salman Khan, who may meet her in the coming days . \nUntil some of the fluid from her body is drained away and her weight is brought down by some 100 kg, the doctors cannot risk putting her under the knife. The surgery is expected to take place in three weeks. \nAlso on HuffPost 7 Incredible Pictures From National Geographic’s Best Photos Of 2016 7 Incredible Pictures From National Geographic’s Best Photos Of 2016 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T16:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T12:42:15.872+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
