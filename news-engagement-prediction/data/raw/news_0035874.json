'It's very hard to compete with these cheap knock-offs.' - Gabrielle Sullivan, Indigenous Art Code \nConsumers aren't the only ones getting ripped off, she said. \n\"It's also taking away the opportunity for the Aboriginal artists who are creating the authentic work. It's taking away the space in the market for their work because it's very hard to compete with these cheap knock-offs.\" Advocates say artists and consumers are cheated by inauthentic Indigenous art. (Arts Law Centre of Australia) \nUnder the existing consumer protection laws in Australia, hawking these faux-Aborginal wares is only illegal if the seller is openly advertising them as authentic. \nArt Code and other advocates want to go a step further and make it illegal to import and sell fake \"Aboriginal-style\" crafts. Katter's bill would put the onus on sellers to have such objects licensed by a First Australian organization. \n\"The only people that would lose out are people that are misappropriating Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island culture,\" Sullivan said. \n\"They can either toe the line and start selling authentic work, of which there is an abundance in Australia, or perhaps they can start selling something else that isn't going to violate the culture of Australia's First Nations people.\" \nWith files from The Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:45:55.194+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
