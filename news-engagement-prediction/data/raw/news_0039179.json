Robert Harward has turned down President Donald Trump’s offer to become his new national security adviser, according to two people with knowledge of the decision. \nHarward would have replaced Michael Flynn, who announced his resignation late Monday amid allegations that he discussed U.S. sanctions with a Russian official before Trump took office and then misrepresented the content of that conversation to Vice President Mike Pence and other administration officials. \nOne factor in Harward’s decision was he couldn’t get a guarantee that he could select his own staff, according to someone close to Trump with knowledge of the discussions. \nOther officials said his decision was motivated by financial concerns about leaving his job at aerospace firm Lockheed Martin, where he now a senior executive, and the impact it would have on his family. \nAccording to CNN , a friend of Harward’s said he rejected the job because of the seeming White House chaos. Howard called the offer a ‘s— sandwich,’ his friend told the network. \nOne senior U.S. official said that “family considerations changed his mind.” A friend of Harward’s added the former Navy SEAL was also not fully comfortable with the quickly moving process. All requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter. \nThe news of Harward’s decision was first reported by The Financial Times. \nThe administration had hoped to name Harward to the position this week, in an effort to soothe the turmoil rolling through the White House. Even before Flynn resigned, the administration was quietly wooing Harward. The hard-charging former Navy SEAL was at the White House on Feb. 8 and then again this week, according to an administration official. Harward commanded high-risk operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and later parachuted into his own retirement ceremony from high altitude. \nTrump suggested at a news conference Thursday that one of the reasons he felt he could let Flynn go was because he had a good replacement in mind, without naming that person. \n“I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position,” he said. “And that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision.” Related ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T09:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T05:40:45.209+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
