He was referring to the US constitution, the supreme law of the land drafted in 1787. \nHe was not being rhetorical. Gorsuch describes himself as an “originalist”, indicating that he places overwhelming importance on the original meaning of the constitution as it was understood by “we the people” at the time it was written. \nThat puts him in a very select group of judges – maybe no more than 30 – who identify themselves as “originalists”. What unites them is that they put as much emphasis on the original understanding of the US constitution as Christian fundamentalists say they put on the original wording of the Bible. \nUntil his death last year, one of the most prominent members of the group was Antonin Scalia, the supreme court justice whom Gorsuch is now lined up to replace. Scalia helped spread the word of originalism among conservative judges in the 1980s as a way of pushing back on what he considered to be the increasingly outlandish opinions of his progressive peers. \nJudges were there, Scalia argued, not to make up their own laws or politically motivated judgments, but to cleave faithfully to the meaning of the framers’ writings as they were understood back in the 18th century by the American people. \n“Originalists ask what the constitution meant at the time it was written, and then argue that the meaning is fixed – it doesn’t change because the world has changed and we now have new problems to deal with,” said Lawrence Solum, a professor at Georgetown Law who is a leading theorist of constitutional originalism. \nDavid Feder, a Los Angeles-based lawyer, had first-hand experience of what that meant to Gorsuch in practice when he worked as his law clerk on the federal 10th circuit court of appeals. “Whenever a constitutional issue came up in our cases, [Gorsuch] sent one of his clerks on a deep dive through the historical sources. ‘We need to get this right,’ was the motto – and right meant ‘as originally understood’,” Feder recalled recently in the Yale Journal of Regulation. \nEven taking into account the modernizing influence of the amendments that have been made to the constitution – most recently a prohibition on changes to congresspeople’s salaries taking effect until the start of the next term for representatives, passed in 1992 – a strict adherence to the founding documents can prove tricky. In 1787, most transportation was by ship or horse, not by plane or motorcar; communication was on parchment and paper rather than through the internet and cellphones; gay marriage was beyond most people’s imagination. \nConundrums can arrive at the level of the word. Solum points out that the seventh amendment, adopted as part of the bill of rights in 1791, guarantees the right to a jury trial in civil cases where the amount in dispute rises above “twenty dollars”. \nTrouble is, the word “dollar” actually referred to a Spanish silver coin that was the main form of currency in 1791. Similarly, the reference to “domestic violence” in article four of the constitution does not equate to spousal or child abuse as it would today but to riots or insurrections within the boundaries of a single state. \nThe world has changed in ways that two-centuries old documents cannot reach. “We have a freedom of speech provision, but when it was written, no one spoke over the internet,” Solum said. \nOriginalists grapple with these contradictions in different ways. In the case of Gorsuch, his approach appears to be to try to stick rigidly to the spirit of the original meaning of the constitution while adapting it to modern circumstances. \nThat makes him something of an unknown quantity: it is hard to predict how he would respond to crucial areas of jurisprudence. Take gay marriage, for example: in the unlikely even that it were to come before the supreme court again, would Gorsuch follow the line taken by Scalia, that gay marriage was not covered by the 14th amendment’s “privileges and immunities” clause because at the time the amendment was adopted in 1868, same-sex marriage was illegal? \nOr would Gorsuch take the view that the original definition of who was entitled to the privilege of marriage could change as society changes? “The people who wrote the provision did not fully envision where it would take us,” Solum said. “Gorsuch could be in that camp: that the meaning of the words remains the same but the implications change as social norms change.” \nThere is no easy way to answer that question, as Gorsuch has participated in no same-sex marriage case law that would provide clues. \nIf confirmed, though, Gorsuch could prove to be an unreliable ally from Trump’s point of view, at least on occasion. Certainly, his accent on sticking to the meaning of the past brings him generally in line with the rightwing conservatism of the Republican party. \nBut originalists like Gorsuch see themselves as fierce protectors of the checks and balances that lie at the core of the US constitution. And as such they have the potential to bristle at presidents seen to be overstepping the limits of their executive powers. \n“It is certainly possible that Donald Trump will try and do things that go well beyond the original understanding of executive power,” Solum said. “When that happens, the president should be ready to be surprised by his nominee’s response.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T18:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T13:03:21.894+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
