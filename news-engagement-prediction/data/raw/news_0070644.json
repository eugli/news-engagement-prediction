The probe will examine whether it would be possible for the Dutch to withdraw from the single currency, and if so how. While most Dutch voters say they favour retaining the Euro, Geert Wilders' (pictured) eurosceptic far-right party is expected to make large gains in next month's elections Omtzigt said: 'The problems with the euro have not been solved. This is a way for us to look at ways forward with no taboos.' The move coincides with a rising tide of euroscepticism in Europe that populist parties are hoping to tap into this year, with national elections also taking place in France and Germany. The most probable outcome of the March 15 in Holland is a new centrist coalition including some parties, including Omtzigt's Christian Democrats, that have been vocal in their opposition to current ECB policy. Thursday's motion instructs the Council of State, the government's legal advisor, to look at 'what political and institutional options are open for the euro,' and 'what are the advantages and disadvantages of each.' The country's relationship with the single currency will be debated in the Dutch parliament (pictured) later this year, once the findings of the report are published Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T00:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T12:26:20.590+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
