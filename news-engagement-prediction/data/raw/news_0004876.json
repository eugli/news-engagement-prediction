If you care about that for your children, he's not your guy,\" she continued.\n  \"It's a very hostile appointment. Hail fellow, well met, lovely family I'm sure. But as far as your family is concerned ... if you breathe air, drink water, eat food, take medicine or in any other way interact with the courts, this is a very bad decision. Well outside the mainstream of American legal thought. Not committed to Supreme Court precedents.\"\nWhen asked by Tapper, Pelosi declined to say whether Senate Democrats should give deference to the president's selection to the court or treat him in the manner Republicans did Merrick Garland last year. Garland did not receive any hearings or a vote after President Obama nominated him in March.\n\"I come down where the Democrats in the Senate do. It's their prerogative to confirm a justice of the Supreme Court , and we'll take our lead from them in the House,\" Pelosi said. \"Our members, though, are a very diverse group. We represent America. They have their opinions. They've been over there to testify against the candidate for attorney general, Sessions. I'm sure they'll be over there to express their views on this subject.\"\n\"Where the Senate leadership comes down, of course, is up to them,\" Pelosi continued. \"Where we'd like them to come down is to make sure that this confirmation subjects the candidate to the strongest scrutiny when it comes to honoring the constitution of the United States. That is our litmus test, the constitution of the United States.\"\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Liberal group: Gorsuch a 'disastrous' choice for Supreme Court Judge's \"record shows no sign that he would offer an independent check\" on the Trump administration.\nBy Ryan Lovelace • 01/31/17 9:32 PM Top  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T04:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T04:48:42.810+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
