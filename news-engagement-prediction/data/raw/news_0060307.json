Roberto Mancini Manchester City title winner in 2012, played for Leicester in the twilight of a glittering career. Has been out of management since leaving Inter Milan in 2016 following an unsuccessful spell, having also departed Galatasaray after just one season in 2014. The Italian boasts an impressive range of clubs on his management CV having also taken charge at Fiorentina and Lazio as well as a first spell as Inter boss before arriving at the Etihad Stadium. Going against the 52-year-old is no experience dealing with a relegation battle. Roberto Mancini is in the frame to take over at Leicester having left Inter Milan in 2016 The former Manchester City boss enjoyed a spell at the Foxes at the end of his career in 2001 Guus Hiddink The 70-year-old Dutchman excelled in a fire-fighting role at Chelsea in 2009, and kept a steady ship following his brief Stamford Bridge return in 2015. Hasn't held a full-time position since leaving his role as Holland boss, where he contributed towards the country suffering catastrophic failure in failing to qualify for Euro 2016. Unlikely to be interested in a full-time position, but could be tempted by another short stint in the Premier League. Guus Hiddink shakes hands with Ranieri during the final game of the 2015-16 Premier League season between Chelsea and Leicester City at Stamford Bridge Michael O'Neill Performing wonders with Northern Ireland but only a candidate if Leicester are in the mood to gamble. O'Neill's reputation has risen after guiding Northern Ireland to the last-16 of Euro 2016, but has no record of managing in England following club spells at Shamrock Rovers and Brechin City. A risky appointment on a number of levels but every manager needs a break somewhere. Michael O'Neill is a candidate to take over after impressing at Euro 2016 with Northern Ireland Martin O'Neill Could make an emotional return to the club he managed with distinction between 1995 and 2000. Republic of Ireland wouldn't be as keen to let their manager take over at the King Power Stadium, but may be flexible to allow the 64-year-old to fill in until the end of the campaign. O'Neill's last Premier League job saw him sacked as Sunderland manager in 2013 after less than two years at the club. Martin O'Neill has been linked with a Foxes return but is the current Republic of Ireland boss O'Neill celebrates with captain Matty Elliott after guiding Leicester to the 2000 League Cup The three who knifed Ranieri...
