Strong whistleblower laws are essential to rebuilding trust and confidence after a long series of crises and scandals in the sector.\" \nWhistleblower protections have been the subject of debate following high-profile corporate scandals at the Commonwealth Bank, CommInsure, IOOF, 7-Eleven and Origin Energy. \nThe scandals have highlighted shortcomings in the law and the personal cost of \"speaking out\" including job loss, bullying and being the target of smear campaigns. \nThe union has also called for new laws to cover workers who blow the whistle on structures that are designed to exploit customers or ignore their best interest. \n\"It is not a coincidence that the number of scandals involving poor advice and customer exploitation has increased as remuneration and management systems designed to exploit customer interaction have become more prevalent,\" it says. \nThe FSU represents workers who are employed in banks, insurance companies, credit unions and superannuation funds across Australia. \nTransparency International has called for whistleblower protection laws to extend to whistleblowers who reasonably make their concerns public. \nGreg Medcraft, the chairman of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, has backed offering money to whistleblowers in recognition of the risks they took and the damage that could be done to their career prospects.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T14:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:33:52.924+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
