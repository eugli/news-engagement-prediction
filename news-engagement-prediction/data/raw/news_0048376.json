Could   \nThe National Living Wage is to rise to £7.50 an hour from April this year, in line with Chancellor Philip Hammond's Autumn Statement announcement in November. \nThe minimum wage for 25-year-olds will rise 4% from £7.20 to £7.50 an hour, in new plans set to go live on 1 April that will leave earners up to £500 better off. \nChancellor Philip Hammond said he hopes to give a big boost to the so-called 'National Living Wage', launched under his predecessor George Osborne's vision, in a bid to get it to £9 by 2020. \nBut, experts say that rate should be more than £2 higher in London at £9.75, or £8.45 across the UK.

There's still a gap between the Government minimum and our real Living Wage of £8.45 in the UK and £9.75 in London, which is based on what families need to earn to meet everyday costs. \nHannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of Money.co.uk said: Increasing the minimum living wage to £7.50 is a helping hand that’ll give full time workers a pay rise of around £600 a year but it’s still not quite enough to afford a decent standard of living. \n\"To really help struggling households £8.50 an hour would be nearer the mark instead. I’d imagine public sector workers are likely to be peeved at this increase as the 4% pay rise dwarfs the 1% cap being forced upon them for the next few years.\" New minimum wage rates from 1 April 2017 *the £3.30 rate apples to apprentices under 19 or in their first year Read More Workplace discrimination over of weight What is the national living wage? \nThe government’s new National Living Wage became law on 1 April 2016 under the former Chancellor George Osborne. \nIf you’re working and aged 25 or over and not in the first year of an apprenticeship, you are legally entitled to at least £7.20 per hour or £7.50 from 2017. \nIf you’re an employer, you need to make sure you’re paying your staff correctly, as the National Living Wage will be enforced as strongly as the current National Minimum Wage. \nFind out if you are eligible for the National Living Wage by using this handy calculator .
