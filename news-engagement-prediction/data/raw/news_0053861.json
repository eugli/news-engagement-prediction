Last week's ruling did not deal with damages. A court is expected to hear arguments on the appropriate amount to be paid out to victims after the 30-day appeal period is up.\nMinister of Indigenous Affairs Carolyn Bennett told CBC News the government does not intend to appeal the ruling.\n'We want to fix this': Indigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett on Sixties Scoop ruling", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T14:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:32:49.304+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
