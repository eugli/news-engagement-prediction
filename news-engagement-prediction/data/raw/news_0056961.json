Marnie Simpson learned Lewis had cheated by watching a video (Picture: Andy Oliver/GoffPhotos.com) \nIn the video, the pair can be seen kissing passionately, and Ammelia told the publication that Lewis had come on to her following the gig, telling her he wanted to kiss her, and that he was only with Marnie for her money. \nMarnie has since responded with a six-and-a-half minute series of SnapChats documenting her shock and heartbreak. \n‘I want to get my point across about what the hell’s just happened,’ she began. \n‘I’ve been filming for Geordie Shore for three weeks with no contact with the outside world No phone, so I haven’t been able to contact anyone. While I was on Geordie Shore it was Valentine’s Night and I was really upset, I sent Lewis a really nice valentine’s card three pages long. Lewis still has images of the pair together on his Instagram (Picture: Instagram) \n‘I tried to ring him the next night because it was a down night. He didn’t answer and I just had a gut feeling,’ she said. \nWhen she got hold of him he’d told her he told her he missed her and that he’d sent roses to the Geordie Shore house. Marnie tweeted after discovering Lewis had cheated (Picture: Twitter) \n‘He was talking to me as he was literally just leaving the hotel where he’s sh**ged this girl,’ she added. \nThe reality star then revealed how she’d had a message telling her what Lewis had done as she left the Geordie Shore house, but she kept it quiet that she knew what had happened because he was still using her Range Rover and she wanted it back. Marnie Simpson posted SnapChats after discovering Lewis had cheated (Picture: instagram) \nIn an even more heartbreaking move, she detailed how she’d thought she could forgive him as she didn’t feel what he’d done was too bad – but then she watched the video of him in bed with the other girl. Marnie admitted she flew into a rage and ‘smashed up my house.’ \n‘I’ve never been cheated on until now and it’s awful, it’s horrendous. I Provide for Lewis, and have done for the last eight months. \n‘He’s had thousands out of me,’ she said. \nThe only response from Lewis so far has been a simple tweet, which said: ‘All good things…’ All good things… \n— Lewis Bloor (@lewis_bloor) February 20, 2017 \nHowever, there’s no clear evidence the pair were still in a relationship at the time. \nReps have been contacted by Metro.co.uk for comment.
