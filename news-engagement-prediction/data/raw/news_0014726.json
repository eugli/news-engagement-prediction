blocked his administration's travel ban on immigrants.

But for many of those in Central Indiana who voted for Trump, the start of his presidency represents not pandemonium, but promise .\nWhat the country is witnessing these first two weeks, they said, is a charismatic chief executive shaking up a declining blue-chip company he just took over, bringing in new blood at the top and making the fast changes in the institutional culture he had promised.\n“I am really impressed with all the things he is doing already; they are all the things he talked about in the campaign,” said Joey Hopper, 37, a single mother of two from Sheridan who works for a global recruiting company. “He was a successful businessman who made millions of dollars and he is using that skill to make America better.”\nUSA TODAY\nTrump attacks judge again on travel ban; Pence predicts victory in courts\nThe perception of the new president in the conservative strongholds of Hamilton and Hancock counties is a stark example of his divisiveness. Where many Democrats see a serial fabricator, a spreader of falsehoods and a peddler of conspiracy theories, Trump's supporters see a straight shooter and a man of action making good on his campaign pledges.\nJoey Hopper,from Sheridan IN., is a Donald Trump supporter and is happy with she has seen in the first two weeks of the President in the White House (Photo: Matt Kryger/IndyStar)\nThe Indianapolis Star interviewed a number of Trump's Hoosier backers to get their early assessment. Simply put, they were encouraged and fortified by his quick action on issues they cared most about: immigration, jobs and bringing in an outsider's energy to Washington government.\nThe moves, they said, confirmed their confidence that Trump’s business background would play a critical part in reshaping the White House and how politics is conducted in Washington. Even his bankruptcies, failed businesses and lawsuits are testament to his single-minded acumen, they contend.\n“He is at Mach 2 with his hair on fire doing what the people elected him to do,” said Carla Glos, 69, a retiree from Noblesville who worked in the auto industry as a controller for 45 years. “He is a shrewd businessman who faced extreme difficulties and hard times. Unless you worked in the private sector, you don’t know what it is like.”\nAt the same time, supporters are miffed and mildly amused at the intensity and speed of the large protests against Trump and his proposed policies, which began even before he took office Jan. 20 and accelerated with a women’s march in Washington, D.C., the day after.\nUSA TODAY\nTrump faces uphill battle in the courts on immigration ban\n“I think there is a lot of overreacting out there, some people are not educating themselves and are just reacting at a moment’s notice,” Hopper said. “It hasn’t even been two weeks. Give him a chance.”\nIt has been a busy two weeks: Trump has signed executive actions aimed at building a wall on the Mexican border and clamping down on \"sanctuary cities\"; he floated a proposal for a 20% border tax on imports from Mexico to pay for the wall; he suspended the U.S. refugee program while temporarily banning immigrants from seven Muslim countries; and he announced his selection of Judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the vacant seat on the U.S. Supreme Court.\nBefore he even took office, Trump intervened to try to keep heating and air conditioning giant Carrier Corp. from moving jobs from Indianapolis to Mexico, and since then he has touted keeping other jobs in the country, including at Ford and Lockheed Martin. And he has promised to dismantle the Affordable Care Act.\nBut the opposition fortified just as quickly. Demonstrations erupted the first weekend after the Nov. 8 election. An estimated half-million protesters flooded the National Mall to call for women’s rights on Jan. 21. And this past weekend, after Trump’s immigration ban was announced, demonstrators poured into the nation’s airports to demonstrate, including at Indianapolis International Airport.\nFortville businessman Bill Clem, 62, called the protests misguided, unprecedented and hypocritical.\nBill Clem,52, is a Donald Trump supporter and is happy with he has seen in the first two weeks of the President in the White House (Photo: Matt Kryger/IndyStar)\nSitting behind a desk in his small auto dealership on Wednesday, Clem scrolled through his Facebook feed. He stopped at a video being shared by his friends that he said illustrated the partisan bent of the protesters.\n“You’re going to love this,” a smiling Clem said.\nThe video showed clips of former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama giving speeches in which they warned about criminal and economic threats posed by undocumented immigrants while unrelated cutaways to Trump showed him nodding his head.\n“All Trump is doing is enforcing the laws that are on the books already, you see?” Clem said. “This opposition, we’ve never really seen anything like that. I mean I kind of liked Obama when he first started. That’s more than they are giving Trump.”\nTo Clem and some other Trump supporters, tightening immigration rules and providing jobs for Americans are inextricably linked. For too long, they said, the country has been sending out jobs that should be kept in the U.S. and taking in immigrants who should have been kept out. Those immigrants compete for what remaining American jobs are left, they maintain.\nSandy Roberts,52, from Sheridan IN., is a Donald Trump supporter and is happy with she has seen in the first two weeks of the President in the White House (Photo: Matt Kryger/IndyStar)\nSandy Roberts, 52, a grocery clerk, said job creation was the only thing that mattered when she voted for Trump.\n\"It was the economy, pure and simple,\" she said outside a Dollar General store in Sheridan. “You need a part-time job to support your full-time job, and all I have is the full-time job. It's why I'm shopping for food at Dollar General.\"\nOn some blocks in Sheridan, population 2,800, passion for Trump is intense. At a household occupied by three elderly sisters, they compared his first two weeks to U.S. Gen. George Patton rolling through Europe, a president with “gumption.” But opposition was also fierce on their block. Though Hamilton County swung for Trump by 20 percentage points, the sisters said they didn’t dare put out Trump campaign signs before the election, and they didn’t want to be Quote: d backing Trump because of possible backlash from neighbors.\nMcCordsville, east of Indianapolis in Hancock County, is even more of a Trump stronghold; Hancock County voters approved him by a 68% to 24% margin.\nLarry Stone,48, is a Donald Trump supporter and is happy with he has seen in the first two weeks of the President in the White House (Photo: Matt Kryger/IndyStar)\nIn a strip of local small businesses with shedding facades, 48-year-old Larry Stone ate lunch at an Italian restaurant. The part-time bartender said Trump voters \"spoke up and now he is doing what he said he would.\"\nStone said if Trump didn’t keep his promises he could face a backlash, but said some promises were more important to keep than others.\nFor example, after the election, Trump quickly dropped his campaign declaration that he would “lock-up” Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton for using a private email server for state department communications.\nStone said such statements weren't to be taken seriously and were considered by those at Trump rallies as a colloquial sentiment of what “should” be done, a kind of conservative slang.\n“Everything is not be taken literally all the time,” he said. “I feel like I have some common sense and I can interpret what he means.”\nSupporters said if Trump doesn’t get the wall built, an expensive proposition that could take decades, that wouldn’t count against him either as long as immigration enforcement was strong in other areas.\n“I’m not sure building a wall would keep the people out,” Hopper said \"It's going to cost who knows how much. There are jokes going around that (immigrants) will just build a tunnel. The laws themselves, if done right, should do the job.\"\nFollow John Tuohy on Twitter: @john_tuohy\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn 'Extreme vetting' executive order spawns protests, rallies Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!
