The “Stone Cold” songstress, 24, liked and retweeted Jonas’ selfie. \nTheir wild and nostalgic fans began taking up arms on social media, begging the duo to cap the “Camp Rock” musical saga with a third film. “Is she still the voice inside your head, the reason that you’re singing?” one asked. Some sensitive fans even “scolded” Jonas for his unholy joke. \n“Don’t play with a Camp Rock fan, man!” one user yelled. @joejonas You can't joke about these things, Joseph. \n— Alex Goldschmidt (@alexandergold) February 12, 2017 @joejonas @ddlovato DON'T PLAY WITH A CAMP ROCK FAN, MAN!! \n— Conexão Lovato (@siteclovato) February 12, 2017 @joejonas @ddlovato is she still the voice inside your head, the reason that you're singing? \n— hayley (@breakthewarning) February 12, 2017 \nIn 2008, Lovato breathed life into the character of budding rock star Mitchie Torres in “Camp Rock.” Jonas played the role of heartthrob singer Shane Gray while his two brothers, Nick Jonas and Kevin Jonas, appeared in the film. \nIn the 2010 sequel “Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam,” the pair reprised their roles and has, since then, managed to stay as close friends, Entertainment Tonight reported. \nJonas hopped in with Lovato by jamming with her on her global tours. In return, Lovato toured with Nick Jonas last year.
