But an optometrist who has invented a ground-breaking test for early diagnosis maintains that this devastating disease has been preventable (and CURABLE) for over five decades. \nIn fact, according to Sydney Bush, DOpt., Ph.D., the situation represents nothing less than a criminal medical conspiracy to perpetuate heart disease – with corrupt medical authorities colluding with the pharmaceutical industry to suppress lifesaving information. \nDiscover how common sense and good science can REVERSE heart disease and improve the quality of our lives. On the next NaturalNews Talk Hour, Jonathan Landsman and Professor Bush discuss the use of high-dose nutrients to dissolve arterial blockages and blood clots – and the simple eye test that can help with early diagnosis. Find out how to prevent and treat heart disease naturally – without the use of toxic medications and risky surgical procedures. \nTo hear this FREE show – visit http://www.naturalhealth365.com/free-shows and enter your email address for show details plus some great gifts! Heart news: CardioRetinometry monitors cardiac health through the eyes \nCardioRetinometry is the science of reversing heart disease as measured via time lapse photographs of retinal arteries. The technique uses time-lapse, ultra-high magnification photography to show plaque in retinal arteries – which perfectly mirror coronary arteries. Therefore, Professor Bush maintains that reversing arterial disease in the eyes can also treat it in the heart and brain. \nProfessor Bush discovered the science of CardioRetinometry – and the use of high-dose vitamins to dissolve arterial plaque – while exploring ways to prevent and treat problems with contact lenses. After his patients experienced not only a more comfortable contact lens-wearing experience – but life-extending arterial plaque reduction as well, he became aware of the true importance of his discovery. \nProfessor Bush says, ‘millions of strokes, heart attacks and operations could be avoided with early detection and lifestyle changes.’ \nFind out how to protect your heart and avoid premature death.

A low-cost, safe alternative to X-ray radiation and toxic pharmaceutical drugs \nIn the 1960s, cardiologists began using angiography – the process of injecting dye into blood vessels, then viewing an X-ray fluoroscope to find arterial blockages. Around 2 million of these procedures are performed every year in the US – to the tune of $2,000 per test. \nProfessor Bush advises CardioRetinometry as a cheaper, more precise alternative – and one that lacks the health risks associated with X-rays. Experts report that that X-rays, which cause exposure to cancer-causing gamma radiation, are responsible for too many (avoidable) cancer cases – every year. \nAnd, unlike the highly magnified and precise images seen with CardioRetinometry, X-rays don’t show the age or color of cholesterol – which is represented only as shadows. \nBottom line: When given the right information, we CAN reduce the risk of dying from a heart attack by 98 percent, while extending lifespan by up to 50 percent. And, that’s great news! \nThis week’s guest: Sydney Bush, DOpt., Ph.D ., creator of CardioRetinometry and an expert in natural medicine \nDiscover the safest way to REVERSE heart disease and extend the quality of your life – S un. Feb. 26 \nProfessor Sydney Bush, an optometrist, educator, lecturer, and leading expert on high-dose nutrients to reverse heart disease, founded the science of CardioRetinometry in 1998, and the Institute of CardioRetinometry in 2006. The head of faculty of optometry and CardioRetinometry at Cosmopolitan University, Professor Bush is the author of Mass Murder Medicine and 700 Vitamin Secrets . \nA past senior research scientist at North Chicago Veterans Medical Center, Professor Bush received his Diploma in Ophthalmic Optics at the Institute of Optical Science in London. \nTo hear this FREE show – visit http://www.naturalhealth365.com/free-shows and enter your email address for show details plus some great gifts!
