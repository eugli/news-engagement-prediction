Eric Greitens enters the House chamber to deliver his State of the State address at the Capitol in Jefferson City, Mo., Tuesday, Jan. 17, 2017. Greitens during the address on Tuesday outlined a policy plan he says will help grow jobs, including passing a right-to-work law barring mandatory union fees and paring back government regulations. (Robert Cohen/St. Louis Post-Dispatch via AP) \nJEFFERSON CITY • Despite vehement opposition from labor unions and Democrats, Republican Gov. Eric Greitens has said he plans to sign controversial right-to-work legislation making its way through the Missouri Legislature. \nThe House has taken up a version of the bill already passed by the Senate. The measure could be heard on the House floor as early as Thursday. \nAs the bill inches closer to Greitens' desk, here's the decades-long political battle, explained: \nWhat does right to work mean? \n“Right to work” is a shorthand for laws throughout the country that prohibit labor unions from requiring workers to pay dues as a condition of employment. Proponents say the law is necessary to end “forced unionism,” giving Missourians the “right to work” without giving up any of their earnings to a labor organization. \nThey also insist that the law will create jobs and make Missouri more competitive, sending a message that the Show-Me state is friendly to employers. \nEven though Missouri isn't yet a right-to-work state, membership isn't compulsory in some unions in the state. But a collective bargaining agreement can require that the employer collect dues from non-members, who don't get to vote for union officials or contracts. \nUnions deemed exclusive bargaining agents are required by federal law to provide fair representation to all workers covered by a contract whether the workers pay dues or not. If they fail to do so, the worker may be able to get relief in court or with the National Labor Relations Board. \nUnions and Democrats argue that a right-to-work law would allow all workers to be \"free riders,\" reaping the benefits bargained for them, like higher wages or better health care benefits, without paying for it. \nAnd without unions financially able to go to bat for them, they contend, Missouri’s working class will see lower wages and fewer benefits. \nSo who’s right? Does the law actually create jobs? \nThat’s not clear. Some studies point to positive effects on states’ economies and wages. Others find little to no impact. \nEconomists attribute that uncertainty to a wide-ranging number of factors that influence job growth — it’s difficult to say whether one policy is responsible for strengthening a state’s economy. \nThe Missouri Chamber of Commerce points to data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis showing that jobs in right-to-work states grew by 8.6 percent in the last decade, compared to 5 percent growth in states without right-to-work laws. \n“Looking across the country, Missouri’s lack of right-to-work protection has put us at a competitive disadvantage when it comes to attracting jobs to our state,” said Dan Mehan, the chamber’s president. \nOther experts don't dispute the job growth, but point out that a lot of states have seen robust job growth as they rebound from the Great Recession, so right-to-work laws passed in that time frame aren’t the only factor to consider. \n\"Right to work doesn't seem to have much of an impact one way or another, both in improving the state's business climate or in terms of devastating the health of organized labor,\" said Jake Rosenfeld, a sociology professor at Washington University in St. Louis. \nThe expansion of right-to-work laws reflects a continuing decline in union strength, Rosenfeld said. \nIn 2016, about 262,000 Missouri workers were members of unions, or about 9.7 percent of the total workforce, according to data released Thursday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics . While that's the highest percentage since 2011, the overall trend has been lower. In 2006, about 284,000 Missouri workers were union members, or about 10.9 percent of the workforce. \n\"The only reason these laws get passed is because unions already decreased dramatically, in terms of what they can get done,\" Rosenfeld said. \nHow did this all start? \nThe door for right-to-work opened when a Republican-led Congress passed the federal Taft-Harley Act in 1947, which deemed “closed shops,” or businesses that required all employees to be part of the union, illegal. From there, individual states could pass laws prohibiting unionized businesses from collecting dues from employees who weren't union members. \nUnions were powerful in the 1930s, but the fast-growing movement didn’t hold its own against mobilized businesses and right-wing organizations who lobbied state legislatures for union restrictions, making right-to-work a heated political issue. \nThe right-to-work debate was renewed when Indiana passed legislation in 2012. Michigan, Wisconsin, West Virginia and Kentucky have all followed suit. \nMissouri would be the 28th right-to-work state. Its shift would mark the first time in U.S. history that more than half of the nation's workforce lived in states with right-to-work laws. \nWhat politics are at play here in Missouri? \nTypically, Republicans — backed by business organizations like the Missouri Chamber of Commerce — are the primary supporters of right-to-work, with limited exceptions. \nUnions far more frequently back Democrats, who generally say that by curbing labor’s ability to collect dues, the GOP is effectively limiting the power and influence of labor unions that often supply millions in donations and volunteers to Democrats’ political campaigns. \nThey also point to megadonors like Joplin business magnate David Humphreys who can pour millions into candidates who support right-to-work legislation under Missouri’s lax campaign finance laws. \n“Any appeal to rational thought, evidence or policy implications stands small against the millions in dark money that have bought this issue passage,” said Senate Minority Leader Gina Walsh, D-Bellefontaine Neighbors, during debate over the Senate’s bill. \nI’m in a union. Will anything change for me? \nThat depends on what type of union you’re in. If dues in your union are already voluntary, this legislation won’t affect you. \nIf you’re under a “union shop” or “agency shop” and you have to pay dues or fees to a union, in time, you will no longer have to — but it’s unclear when that would happen. \nThe Missouri House and Senate have each passed their own version of a right-to-work bill. They’re almost identical, except for one provision, known as a “grandfather clause.” The Senate bill leaves unchanged any labor contracts negotiated before the bill takes effect, letting them expire on their own. \nSome House proposals had a similar provision, but they didn’t make it into the version that the House ultimately approved. \nIf the final right-to-work law contains a grandfather clause, your current contract will remain in effect. When it expires, you’ll no longer have to pay if you don't want to be a union member. \nIn St. Louis specifically, agency shop contracts cover workers at Ameren, Boeing, Laclede Gas, as well as phone companies and major grocery chains. \nSo what are the next steps? \nThough both chambers have weighed in, there are a few more steps the measure has to take before it makes its way to Greitens’ desk. For now, it looks like the House is taking up the Senate's version of the bill for debate. \nBut the bill’s passage, sooner rather than later, is all but guaranteed. Right-to-work was at the top of the agenda for both GOP leaders and the new chief executive this year. Republicans have tried to pass similar legislation in years past, but found a roadblock in former Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat. \nIs anyone exempt? \nAs drafted now, the bills don’t apply to federal workers, workers on military bases and workers under the National Railway Labor Act, such as airline and railroad workers. \nAsked if there were any other groups Greitens would like to see exempted, a spokesman for the governor wasn’t immediately able to comment. \nWill voters have a say? \nAccording to Republican lawmakers, they already have. Right-to-work was a major talking point in the 2016 election cycle, particularly in race for governor. Greitens' Democratic opponent, former Attorney General Chris Koster, spoke out against the legislation. \nSo Republicans argue that by electing Greitens and other GOP candidates on board with the legislation, voters have spoken. \nOpponents to the bill point to a right-to-work ballot measure that was overwhelmingly rejected by Missouri voters in 1978, when the Missouri Capitol was controlled by labor-friendly Democrats. \nAttempts to attach a referendum to the bills currently being considered — which would put the issue before voters a second time — have failed. \nBut union backers are pushing separate ballot initiatives in 2018 that would give voters the chance to effectively reverse any right-to-work law passed this year. Lawsuits have already been filed to block those initiatives. Political Fix from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch \nBe informed.
