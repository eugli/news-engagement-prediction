But we already have a lead on what the next Android version could be called. \nHiroshi Lockheimer, senior vice president of Android, Chrome and Chromecast at Google tweeted a gif image today of an Oreo cake hinting that the next version of Android, as per the Alphabet, might be called Android Oreo. \nBut swinging names around for upcoming Android versions is a hobby Lockheimer might not have given up yet. Last year, he hinted Android Nutella to the name of Android version 7.0 which, well, didn't turn out to be true. \nBut it could also be due to a trademark issue. When Google used Kit Kat, both Nestle and the Android maker had said that the deal allowing the trademark inside the smartphone did not involve any money exchanging hands.

But it might not have turned out to be the same with Nutella. \nGoogle has always named its Android OS updates after sweets, except the first two that were called the Android Alpha and Android Beta, following the Alphabet sequentially. They were named Cupcake, Donut, Eclair, Froyo, Gingerbread, Honeycomb, Ice Cream Sandwich, Jelly Bean, KitKat, Lollipop, Marshmallow and Nougat.

Though, the name is in fact a registered trademark of biscuit maker Nabisco of US. \nLockheimer also put #2018 as a title to a photo he tweeted last week. The spooky part is that the photo is of a Japanese chocolate-coated snack named 'Pocky'.
