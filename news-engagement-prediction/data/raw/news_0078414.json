Story continues below \nAccording to Cleaveland, on Jan. 17, she requested compassionate care leave from her job at Scarolie’s in Pointe-Claire . \nShe said she filed the paperwork with the employment insurance, but as it was being processed, her mother passed away. \nCleaveland said she immediately cancelled the leave and shortly after, returned to work. \n“I dealt with her funeral and everything that needed to be dealt with and on Feb. 6, it was a Monday, I went into work,” she said. \n“Into Scarolie’s and I said ‘OK, I’m ready to come back on the schedule.'” \nBut Cleaveland says managers never put her back on the schedule. \nTammy Cleaveland in a photograph with her mother, Friday, Feb. 24, 2017. Felicia Parrillo/Global News \nAfter going back and forth with the restaurant for about a week, Cleaveland insists she had no choice but to find another job. \n“I think what they did is wrong,” she said. \n“I didn’t do anything wrong, I didn’t lie about anything, I produced all the documents of my mother from the unemployment and they didn’t give me my job back.” \nHowever, Scarolie’s co-owner Costa Kouniaris tells a different story. \n“We didn’t officially let her go,” he said. \n“We told her, ‘listen, right now, we don’t have exactly the shifts. We thought you were going to be away for three months and you know, [we said] call us back.'” \nKouniaris said the restaurant has always been flexible with Cleaveland’s schedule and they don’t understand why she’s trying to damage their name. \n“We built our reputation based on honesty, trust and good food, great service,” he said. \n“We have an individual who’s trying to ruin our reputation and I think it’s wrong.” \nGlobal News reached out to Cleaveland’s union president, who also claims that Cleaveland was fired. \nThe union said its lawyers have filed an illegal dismissal complaint on her behalf. \nHowever, they argue that Cleaveland isn’t an isolated case. \nThe union said it has filed seven other illegal dismissal complaints. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
