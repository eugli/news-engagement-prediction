I’m glad to see that China is using this kind of technology.”\nOn Twitter, another user suggested: “China should consider engineering space-based solar power stations.”\nAnother Twitter user shared an image of the solar farm taken from the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-2 satellite.\n#ESA #Sentinel2 image shows dimensions of world's largest photovoltaic power plant with 850 MWp: #Longyangxia Solar #China #renewableenergy pic.twitter.com/UjmHvemSuF\n— Harald Zandler (@HZandler) February 21, 2017\nBoth Facebook and Twitter are blocked in China.\nThe Longyangxia Dam Solar Park is China’s latest in a long line of large-scale solar energy projects.\nA solar farm in the city of Cixi in eastern Zhejiang province made the news recently for installing 300 hectares of solar panels above a fish farm.\nStrong progress by Chinese solar power generators will see subsidies eliminated by 2025\nThe farm is expected to generate 220 gigawatt hours of electricity a year – enough power for 100,000 households – according to the state-run Xinhua news agency.\nLast September, Bloomberg reported that a 2GW capacity solar farm with 6 million solar panels was being built in the Ningxia autonomous region, which would make it the the world’s largest solar plant.\nChina is the world’s largest solar power producer by capacity, with total installed capacity of 77.4GW at the end of 2016, the National Energy Administration said this month.\nYang Hongxing, a renewable energy professor at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, said China had become a world leader in solar energy in the last two years as the central government intensified new energy development to resolve its pollution woes.\n“China is likely to stay a leader in this area for the next few years or for an even longer,” Yang said.\n“The low cost of building photovoltaic modules (solar panels) in China is the country’s main advantage. Many modules in the US and Europe are made in China.”\nChina sets up laboratory to research building solar power station in space\nThe government was also encouraging the private sector to invest in renewable energy by subsidising clean power generation, the professor said.\nChina’s main challenge, however, was in transmitting the solar power farmed from sparsely populated northwestern regions like Qinghai and Ningxia to the coastal cities, Yang said.\nThe country lacked the infrastructure to efficiently transmit power across regions, he said.\n“Some of these solar energy plants have to shut [for some time each year] because there is no use for such energy in those regions,” he said.\nSolar plants generated 66.2GW of China’s electricity last year, accounting for 1 per cent of the country’s total power generated, according to the National Energy Administration’s statistics.\nThe country aims to boost the proportion of electricity generated from non-fossil fuel sources to 20 per cent by 2030 from 11 per cent today. It also plans to plough 2.5 trillion yuan (HK$2.82 trillion) into renewable power generation by 2020.", "external_links": ["http://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/02/24/359271da-fa45-11e6-bcc4-de1d4609fc98_1320x770.jpg", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/renewableenergy?src=hash", "http://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/02/24/2b894a4c-fa45-11e6-bcc4-de1d4609fc98_1320x770.jpg", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/China?src=hash", "https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FPeoplesDaily%2Fphotos%2Fa.191212920930533.63965.188625661189259%2F1447402255311587%2F%3Ftype%3D3&width=500", "https://t.co/UjmHvemSuF", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/ESA?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Sentinel2?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Longyangxia?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/HZandler/status/833968856829935616", "http://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/02/24/23e5a48e-fa45-11e6-bcc4-de1d4609fc98_1320x770.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-24T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T11:47:16.081+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
