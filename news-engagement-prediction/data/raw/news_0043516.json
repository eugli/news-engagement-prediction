While it looks pretty much like the G5 Plus, the regular Moto G5 is a tad smaller, as it features a 5-inch 1080p display, instead of a 5.2-inch 1080p screen of its larger brethren. According to the source of the newly leaked hands-on photos, the Moto G5 has a metal back, and its battery is a removable one. Naturally, this should apply to the G5 Plus as well.Both the Moto G5 and Moto G5 Plus run Android Nougat, and one of the new images seemingly confirms the fact that the former handset does come with Android 7.0 pre-installed. Other Moto G5 features should include a fingerprint scanner, splash resistance, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 processor, 2 GB of RAM, and 32 GB of expandable storage space. As for the G5 Plus, this will be powered by a Snapdragon 625 processor, while offering 64 GB of expandable internal memory. Lenovo and Motorola will likely announce the Moto G5 and G5 Plus on February 26 at MWC 2017. The two handsets could be released shortly thereafter, possibly costing $200 and $250, respectively. We're certainly expecting both new phones to be sold in the US unlocked. Let us know if you think you'll want to buy any of them, will you?
