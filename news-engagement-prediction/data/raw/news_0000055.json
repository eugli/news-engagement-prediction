(The software also works on Macs and PCs.) You can use it to just play around by mimicking your doodles, or connect it to the internet via Wi-Fi and send and receive messages from anywhere in the world. If someone has the app, they can send a drawing straight to your Line-us over the internet. Okay, so it’s hardly a practical way to get in touch with someone, but who cares: it’s got personality . \n\nThe creators of Line-us say they want to create a community of users who collect each other’s drawings via the app, and customize the bot itself. Line-us has its own interface for connecting with Scratch, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Python, and can be adapted in a number of ways. You could give it a set of watercolors to paint with, or have a pair of devices drawing in tandem. It seems ripe for all sorts of DIY fun. \nThe project has already been fully-funded, but there are still early bird units available costing £69 ($86) instead of the usual £99 ($124). If all goes to plan, Line-us will be shipping worldwide this October.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T10:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T11:25:40.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
