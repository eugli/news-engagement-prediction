BATTLE “I am told that they have sent some youths to make noise but we will not be cowed,” Mr Arati said. ODM chairman John Mbadi said the good reception in Meru was an indication that the opposition had support in the area. “I used to say that Meru is a battle ground but I now believe this is a Nasa zone,” Mr Mbadi said. Suna East Junet Mohamed said the opposition was keen on garnering many votes in areas considered to be Jubilee strongholds, including Meru. HOOLIGANISM Hooliganism and intolerance have marred campaigns by the two main rivals in the August General Election, Jubilee and Nasa. Early this month, Mr Odinga was heckled in Turkana East, a month after his campaign was disrupted in Changamwe, Mombasa. On the hand, Jubilee Deputy Party Leader William Ruto was heckled in Narok after he was received and hosted by leaders facing resistance on the ground. Mr Ruto was also blocked from entering Bungoma town early this year. TWO SEATS \nThis is the second visit by Mr Odinga to Meru in less than a month. \nDuring his last visit on January 26, he received a warm welcome at Makutano, Kianjai, Muriri, Maili Tatu and Laare towns. \nIn the last elections, Mr Odinga’s party clinched two seats in the region, Igembe Central and Tigania East parliamentary posts. \nBut the two MPs elected on ODM’s ticket, Mr Kubai Kiringo and Mr Mpuru Aburi have since decamped to Jubilee.
