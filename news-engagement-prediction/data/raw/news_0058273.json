If it launches atop the tally, it will secure the artist his fourth leader on the list. Those in the know suggest the set could earn around 150,000 equivalent album units in the week ending Feb. 22. Perhaps 50,000 to 60,000 of that sum might be traditional album sales. \nThe Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week based on multi-metric consumption , which includes traditional album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). The top 10 of the new March 11, 2017-dated Billboard 200 chart (where Future could debut at No. 1) is scheduled to be revealed on Billboard’s websites on Sunday, Feb. 28. \nFuture’s latest album was released through A-1/Freebandz/Epic Records on Feb. 17. \nIf Future’s new set opens at No. 1, it will mark his fourth consecutive debut in the pole position, following Evol (2016) and What a Time to Be Alive (with Drake) and DS2 (both in 2015).
