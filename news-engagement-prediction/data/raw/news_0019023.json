(near Runnymede Ave.), 647-643-3132, awai.ca\nChef: Nathan Isberg\nHours: Tuesday to Saturday, 6:30 p.m. to 10 p.m.\n Reservations: Yes\nWheelchair access: Yes\nPrice: Dinner for two with wine, tax and tip: $70\nBeet this\nThere’s nothing fake about Awai.\nThe new vegan restaurant in Bloor West Village is the real deal, run by a philosophical chef who uses heady spices and umami-rich mushrooms to showcase the deliciousness of plants. No faux hot dogs here.\n“The way we have to work backwards from meat-centric cuisine is farcical,” says Nathan Isberg (ex- The Atlantic ).\nIsberg stays on the straight and narrow foodwise, puréeing white beans into velvety soup ($15) showered in black truffles from Burgundy. He elevates golden beet soup ($12) with fragrant berbere powder, chopped pistachios and the delight of fresh mint.\nWhat’s not to like?\nThe iconoclast\nIsberg, 41, is a classically trained chef and anthropologist who puts big ideas into practice.\nThere is no tipping at Awai (pronounced “ah-WHY,” it is Japanese for subtle but necessary). Servers earn a living wage. Leave extra money if you want, but it isn’t expected.\nIsberg has abolished the usual restaurant hierarchy, which he believes “creates a culture of violence.” Here, he and his cooks bring food to the tables and interact with diners.\nFood accessibility is another key concept. Awai makes a daily vegetable curry served with chickpea flour pancakes. At $3, it is as tasty as it is affordable.\nThe vibe\nIsberg and business partner Roger Yang opened Awai on Dec. 1 in a former Italian restaurant.\nThe minimalist 36-seat front dining room is quiet, letting customers converse for hours over gingery kefir mocktails ($8) or organic wines. I dare you not to chuckle at the list. The organic Mas de Soleilla Petit Mars ($13) is personified as “a French man who makes friends easily and . . . gives out toffee and minty pastilles to the children.”\nIt all feels quite relaxed but be warned: Because Awai deliberately lacks a manager, service can be hit and miss.\nGo to seed\nFrom the previous tenant’s wood-burning oven emerge the crisp Spanish flatbreads that are Isberg’s culinary calling card. The dough, now free of lard, holds up well under caramelized onions and oyster mushrooms ($17) or a bushel of roast cherry tomatoes ($16).\nIsberg further harnesses the flames to blister potatoes in the coals. He turns the blackened, more flavourful spuds into dumplings ($18) partnered with crunchy white onions and an Arab bazaar’s worth of spices.\nThen there are the seedlings he cultivates on site for a lively salad ($13) lightly dressed with nutty argan oil and cider vinegar.\nChocolate fix\nThe more complicated dishes work, too, such as translucent handmade ravioli filled with silky artichokes ($19) and splashed with white wine. The poached pear ($12) sports a crunchy praline mantle and a hidden centre of bittersweet chocolate.\nWithout cream or eggs, the kitchen gels pulverized pine nuts and the root vegetable salsify into crème brûlée ($10) using carrageenen, a seaweed extract. The grainy texture is off, the one time the plant-based menu is lacking. Even the tarte Tatin ($13) is delicious sans butter.\nSoon Awai will serve lunch. I said Planta was the city’s best vegan restaurant. I was wrong.\napataki@thestar.ca , Twitter @amypataki", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:02:50.426+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
