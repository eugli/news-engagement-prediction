But his ties aren't forgotten. \nThe Frenchman left his native land to join the Serie A before returning to Ligue 1 with Saint-Etienne, or well he thought so. \nDuring the January transfer window, 'The Greens' agreed to snap up the midfielder in order to bolster their attacking options. \nThough he left the club just FOUR days after arriving following the discontent shown by the Saint-Etienne faithfuls. Signed on loan on Friday, Anthony Mounier to quit Saint Etienne already after being deemed public enemy no.1 pic.twitter.com/mhjWMUKlPe - Mohammed Ali (@mohammedali_93) January 30, 2017 \nThe clubs supporter groups, 'The Green angles', issued a defiant message once he completed his move. \nBanners were unfolded at the clubs training center which read; \"Mounier, our colours will never be yours .\" \nThe manager Christophe Galtier weighed in on the controversial transfer by saying; \n\"The situation in regards with Anthony Mounier is not a pleasant one for anyone involved. It was the right decision. Sometimes one does not need to be ashamed to take a backward step.\" \nThe 29-year-old is set to remain in Italy after all - linking up with Atalanta on loan. \nCrazy!
