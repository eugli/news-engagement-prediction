Oliver Dixon - olliedixon.com Amit and Leena Sangar with twins Keira and Kiyan Oliver Dixon - olliedixon.com Pair in a million . . . Kiyan and Keira \nHere, the mum from Hornchurch, Essex, tells her moving story. \n\n“When she was born, Keira turned a slight shade of purple. \n“I lay there, drugged and exhausted from the C-section at 38 weeks, with Kiyan, our little boy, enjoying skin-to-skin contact with me. Amit had been holding Keira. \n“She was put under a special light and alarm bells started to ring. Oliver Dixon Mum Leena with her twins in hospital Oliver Dixon Keira (right) was born with Down’s syndrome with brother Kiyan was not \n“She was then whisked away and spent ten days in intensive care. \n“The hospital staff hinted she had Down’s syndrome — but it was only on day seven that they gave me a straight answer. \n“Yes, one of our much-longed-for babies had Down’s. Keira’s twin, Kiyan, was healthy. \n“We’d known there was a possibility — our earliest blood test at Queen’s Hospital in Romford had shown that one of our twins had a one in 18 chance of being Down’s. Oliver Dixon Before giving birth Leena was told one twin had a one in 18 chance of being Down’s Oliver Dixon 16 The twins celebrating their first birthday \n“At 16 weeks I was offered the Harmony test, which screens blood to pinpoint the syndrome with 99 per cent accuracy. \n“But Amit said to me: “What will we do if we know? Would we abort our child, knowing it would jeopardise the other twin’s life?” \n“When I first found out about the risk of Down’s, I broke down in tears. I thought: “How could God do this to us again?” Oliver Dixon - olliedixon.com The couple had seven cycles of IVF before Keira and Kiyan were born Oliver Dixon Keira has mild symptoms compared to many other Down’s syndrome children \n“In 2010, we had lost twins Amar and Esha to pre-term labour. \n“I had conceived them on our third cycle of IVF and already it had been a roller coaster. \n“After a pregnancy which had seemed fine, they were born suddenly at 26 weeks. \n“Amar passed away after 30 minutes, while Esha survived for 48 heartbreaking hours. \n“We at least got to hold them both — but only after they had died. Oliver Dixon - olliedixon.com When Keira was born she spent ten days in intensive care \n“Now here we were, with two lively twins, after seven cycles of IVF and so much emotion. \n“We had even hesitated in having two eggs implanted — should we try for twins again? Look what happened last time. \n“But we were persuaded that two eggs were the best option. \n“When Keira was born, I looked at her as she lay in her intensive care cot with the characteristic poking-out tongue of a Down’s baby. It frightened me. Oliver Dixon 16 Keira has a slower development rate than her twin Kiyan \n“Would I be able to love this child? At first, I didn’t want to see her and I was in tears talking to my cousin. \n“I looked into the future and thought: “What does this mean for her, for us, for our family?” \n“I knew virtually nothing about Down’s syndrome, other than the fact that those affected were likely to be dependent their entire life. \n“It took me months to bond with Keira. Kiyan was different — a normal, healthy baby. \n“I worried that I wasn’t bonding with Keira. Why was I holding back? Oliver Dixon Leena said it took her months to bond with Keira Oliver Dixon Keira and Kiyan dressed in festive gear \n“The honest answer is that her syndrome scared me. \n“I didn’t know how to treat her. \n“Then, over the months, I saw her personality begin to develop. \n“Yes, she was much smaller than her twin. \n“Yes, it took her longer to develop the fundamentals of growth — she has always been floppier than Kiyan, less able to sit up, to point and crawl.

She doesn’t have heart problems. Don’t give her special treatment. Just love her.” \n“I began to put my fears to the back of my mind — that she might be bullied at school, that she would always lag behind her schoolmates, that there would be so many things she couldn’t do.

Oliver Dixon - olliedixon.com 16 Leena says the family are lucky to have Keira \n“I count myself lucky that Keira’s symptoms are mild, that she’s mobile and she is progressing. \n“Everyone loves her to bits.
