Pence defended him on one of the Sunday shows, and Flynn has confirmed that he apologized to Pence for providing “incomplete information.” \nBut according to NBC News , Pence was only informed of the DOJ’s warning about Flynn days after President Trump and the White House knew: \nVice President Mike Pence was informed of the Justice Department warning regarding former national security adviser Michael Flynn late on February 9, 15 days after the White House and the president knew, two sources tell NBC News. \nOne is a source close to the vice president, while the other is inside the Trump administration. \nThe initial report said it was 11 days, but an editor’s note has since been attached to say it was 15. \n[ image via Gino Santa Maria/Shutterstock ] \n—— \n  Mediaite", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T06:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:55:17.102+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
