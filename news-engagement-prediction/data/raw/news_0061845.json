I was stopped.' - Jonathan Hardy, taxi driver Another man, 26, who was riding on the back of the snowmobile was hurt, but survived.\n\"I would like to talk to the family of the boy who died, knowing that this young fellow is the same age of my youngest son, and that really gets to me, you know,\" Hardy told the Corner Brook Morning Show.\n'It came out of nowhere' Hardy was driving the Birchy Cab passenger van at around 4 a.m. on that Sunday, bringing several people to Humber Valley Resort, near Corner Brook.\nHe was travelling along the access road, near the bridge that extends across the Humber River, when he saw lights coming toward him in his own lane.\n\"I hesitated a second,\" said Hardy. \"Should I pull over, or go in the other lane? So I said, 'No, I'll play it safe.' I put on my brakes and pulled off to the [right-hand] side of the road, and I just stopped ... I didn't know anything else until I was struck.\"\nJonathan Hardy told his story to CBC's Corner Brook Morning Show. (Brian McHugh/CBC)\nHardy estimated there were only five or six seconds from when he saw the lights, until when he felt the snowmobile hit the front of the van.\n\"It came out of nowhere,\" he said. \"I didn't even know it was coming at me.\"\n'I didn't know if they were dead or alive' As Hardy tried to make sense of what was happening, he got out of the van and looked.\n\"I saw two people laid out on the road, I didn't know if they were dead or alive. It kind of put a scare in me, and that's when I started going into shock.\"\nHardy said the snowmobile driver had apparently flown over the top of the taxi, hitting the van's windshield before landing behind the vehicle.\nHis passenger had landed near the side of the van and had apparently broken his legs.\n'I saw two people laid out in the road ... and that's when I started going into shock.' - Jonathan Hardy After emergency crews arrived, Hardy went to hospital for about four hours for tests and observation. He was fitted with a temporary neck brace and released.\nThen, around suppertime, he got the news that the snowmobile driver had died.\n\"When I heard that, I just about dropped to my knees. I was thinking I was at fault, and then I started thinking everything through and I said, 'No, I couldn't have been at fault. I was stopped. I never hit the machine, the machine hit me.' I think I went back in shock again, I can't really recall.\"\n'It could have been prevented' Hardy said he's been driving since he was 17, and it's difficult to deal with the fact that the first collision he's ever been involved in had such a tragic outcome.\n\"Everybody is talking about it and it was really starting to get to me, knowing that this young fellow died and it could have been prevented, I'm sure.\"\nPolice have not said whether alcohol was a factor in the crash, but another taxi driver who arrived on the scene just after the collision said the two snowmobilers were not wearing helmets or winter coats.\n'Why didn't he have a helmet on?' Cab driver shaken by deadly crash at Humber Valley Resort Hardy said he has had trouble sleeping since the accident because of neck pains.\nIt's been helpful to talk with his girlfriend about what happened. He's also had some reassurance from the passengers who were with him that morning.\n\"I had a van load of people and they told me that what I did was the right thing. I pulled off to the side, I didn't cause anything. Everybody is saying I wasn't at fault.\"\nHardy said he'll probably go back to driving taxi, \"but I'm in no rush.\"\nWith files from Corner Brook Morning Show", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T22:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T06:17:35.598+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
