Figures sent to Hughes by Energy Minister Judith Collins reveal $111,331 was spent by the Government on marketing and promotions for the most recent block offer for oil exploration last year. Of that figure, $42,000 was spent on overseas travel, $3200 on local travel and the rest on marketing. Hughes said given only one permit was awarded in Block 2016 to New Zealand company, Todd Energy, it defied belief that so much money would be spent on attracting offshore companies. \nREAD MORE: \n\"We saw money spent on international travel and promotion that didn't get any result so the Government is literally throwing money down black holes,\" he said. MAARTEN HOLL/FAIRFAX NZ \nEnergy Minister Judith Collins says oil companies make \"significant contributions'' to the economy. \n\"It's clear that exploration has declined massively, we've seen oil manufacturers leave the country, so there's a different global dynamic in 2017 and it's time to get with the times and not relive an old-fashioned glory time.\" \nBut Collins said while only one permit was awarded last year, \"significant exploration in New Zealand has continued during 2016 and 2017. \n\"Exploration activity is long-term and the market works in cycles. Fifteen permits were granted in 2014 â€“ including to major international companies like Chevron - and nine permits were granted in Block Offer 2015. The work from these permits will continue for many years to come.\" \nShe said a major drop in the international price of oil in 2014 means the \"response to petroleum permit tenders globally has been subdued compared to previous years\". \n\"The global petroleum industry is now showing signs of recovery, which should bode well for future Block Offers, in time.\" \nHughes said that was the \"same old spin, different minister. \n\"These guys have gone, they've left New Zealand, they've surrendered their permits and cancelled their work programmes. \n\"Times have changed even in the last three years so I'd be urging the Government to quit supporting and subsidising the oil industry when there's such a smaller amount of global interest and activity.\" \nHughes argued the money would be better spent \"supporting clean energy. \n\"Instead of reliving the 1960s we could be looking to the future.\" \nCollins said petroleum production made a \"significant contribution to the New Zealand economy\", with $3 billion in royalties to the Crown over the last nine years. \n\"New Zealand Petroleum & Minerals' spending on promotions is good value for money, considering the potential economic returns. For example, the companies awarded permits in Block Offer 2014 have a committed exploration expenditure of $110 million,\" she said. - Stuff ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T07:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T02:20:09.864+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
