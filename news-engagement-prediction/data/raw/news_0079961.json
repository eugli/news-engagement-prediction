While clinging to its branches, Chirindza, previously named in the media as Sofia Pedro, went into labour.\nHer mother-in-law held a capulana (a long sarong) under her to catch the baby and prevent it from falling into the crocodile-infestedwaters.

Nearly 800 people died in the disaster.\nShe became a rallying point for securing millions of dollars in international aid, to help those affected and to improve flood protection schemes that have prevented a repeat of the huge death toll.\nA plaque has been erected on the mafureira (natal mahogany tree) where she was born.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rosita Mabuiango, 17, plans to study petrochemical engineering.
