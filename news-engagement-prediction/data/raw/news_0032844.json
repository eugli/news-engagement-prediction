Ioannou Replay Video SETTINGS OFF HD HQ SD LO For the first time ever, water began flowing over the emergency spillway at the Oroville Dam and into the Feather River on Saturday, the California Department of Water Resources announced.\nThe emergency spillway for the dam, which was completed in 1968, has never been used, and the rushing water is expected to erode the hillside channel rapidly, pushing dirt and debris into the river below. “It’s a heavy spray I would say — it’s not a massive flow, but any flow on any spillway is very visible,” said Ted Thomas, a spokesman for the California Department of Water Resources.\nProblems for the dam — the nation’s tallest at 770 feet — began earlier this week when a large, crater-like hole formed in the concrete of the main spillway. Recent heavy rains in the Sierra foothills have caused Lake Oroville to swell to 149 percent of its normal volume, requiring greater releases to prevent flooding. With the strain of those high-volume releases, the gash in the main spillway has continued to grow.\nLake Oroville is a key water-storage facility that also controls salinity in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to keep fish and wildlife healthy. It provides water to farms, businesses and homes in the Central Valley and Southern California.\nState officials had hoped to avoid using the emergency spillway and, as of Friday afternoon, were optimistic the flow of water could be managed by the main spillway. Crews, however, had worked this week to clear the channel of trees and debris as best they could in the event it needed to be opened.\n< PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 28 NEXT SLIDE > The California Department of Water Resources and host of collaborating agencies continue to monitor the Lake Oroville spillway flows late Thursday afternoon as 35,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) of water was released over the damaged spillway. More erosion is expected, but the releases will help operators absorb the inflow of the storm waters expected Thursday evening and Friday. DWR first noticed erosion on the spillway Tuesday morning and shut off flows to investigate. There is no imminent or expected threat to public safety or the integrity of Oroville Dam in Butte County.

Grow/California Department Of Water Resources\nEarly Saturday, the Department of Water Resources issued a statement saying the emergency spillway would need to be used. The agency added that the discharge did not pose a flood threat to the Feather River.\n“Oroville Dam itself remains safe, and there is no imminent threat to the public,” the department said in a statement released at 6:45 am Saturday.\nThe Department later announced that water began flowing over the emergency spillway at 8 a.m. Once the water level of Oroville Lake rises above a certain elevation, water begins to flow automatically into the emergency channel.\nThe flow is estimated at up to 12,000 cubic feet per second for the emergency spillway and 55,000 cubic feet per second for the main spillway, and the inflow is estimated at 89,000 cubic feet per second, department spokesman Ted Thomas said.\n“That pushes the total outflow from the Oroville Lake through the dam and the spillways to approximately 65,000 cubic feet per second, total outflow — well within the Feather River’s channel capacity, well within the river’s capability to carry,” said Doug Carlson, a department spokesman.\nThe emergency spillway will be in use for about three to five days, according to Department estimates Saturday morning.\nNo evacuations or damage to property or infrastructure are expected, according to Thomas.\nWater releases this week down the main spillway already have turned the Feather River’s waters brown and cloudy with silt, a threat that looms over local fish populations.\nOn Thursday, the cloudiness of the water running into the Feather River Hatchery in Butte County was “off the charts,” a spokesman for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife told The Chronicle. The hatchery is “very important” to California salmon production, according to John McManus, executive director of the Golden Gate Salmon Association.\n“It provides a lot of the fish that are caught in the ocean,” McManus said. “The loss of those fish would indeed be a blow to the salmon fishery.”\nFilipa A.
