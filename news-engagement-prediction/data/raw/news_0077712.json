The group was on a tour bus, and they were told that they were going to an exhibit about Oscar dresses. And, as Kimmel pointed out, it wasn’t a total lie, as they were going to see a lot of dresses from the awards show. But, the dresses were going to be on actual live people, and they were going to be at the actual show. \nAs the group approached the theater, Kimmel turned the lights off, and when the group walked in, the audience shouted, “Mahershala!” The tourists were introduced to celebs including Ryan Gosling , Nicole Kidman , Mahershala Ali , whose Oscar they got to touch, and Jennifer Aniston , who gave a fan her sunglasses. Denzel Washington even performed a “ceremony” for an engaged couple. \nWatch the video above for the entire surprise. \n[featured image via screen grab] \nHave a tip we should know?
