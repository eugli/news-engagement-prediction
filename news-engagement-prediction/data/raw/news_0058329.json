Contacted by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the attorney for the plaintiffs, Sharonta and Moses Simpson, also chose not to comment.\nBut the Simpsons’ lawyer, Andy Cash, detailed the case in the complaint.\nThe suit says a MARTA service worker hit the shut-off switch, but Monique was so entangled by then that rescuers had to call for the Jaws of Life.\nDuring it all, the child was conscious and alert, in excruciating pain.\nRELATED: After recent killings, how safe is MARTA?\nRELATED: Trailer stolen from church days before Boy Scout camping trip\nRELATED: 'Surrounded by death’: Witness recalls I-285 wreck that killed 3\nDesperate rescuers called a doctor at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston to phone in a prescription for Fentanyl, one of the strongest painkillers available. The drug is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine.\nIt was administered while she was still trapped at 5:30 p.m.\nThe Atlanta Fire Department used the Jaws of Life at 5:44 p.m., more than half an hour after the escalator first tugged at Monique’s coat.\nShe was rushed to Children’s Healthcare.\nShe had surgery that day.\nThe surgeon, Dr. Robert Bruce, took note of her injuries in the process. She had a “horribly contaminated crush injury” running from the back of the heel pad to the long bone of the pinky toe, the lawsuit said. The muscle above her ankle was pulled from the bone, along with nerves and veins.\nBruce said the foot couldn’t be saved.\nThe child required multiple subsequent surgeries and now has a prosthesis, the suit said.\nThe parents are suing for damages to be determined in court.\nRELATED: Mom out on bond after 2-year-old son shoots his sister\nRELATED: Hours apart, plane crashes claim 3 lives\nRELATED: Teacher resigns amid investigation into relationship with student", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:43:15.480+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
