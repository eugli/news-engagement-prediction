The Soulja Boy and Chris Brown fight isn’t happening. Then again, who needs a fight when you’re on tour with 50 Cent, Fabolous and a host of others. \nSoulja taunted Brown on Twitter before Breezy officially called the fight off, saying the controversial R&B singer was scared. \n“Can’t believe this nigga scared to fight me sign the contract Bitch Ass nigga set up the boxing match,” he wrote in the multi-tweet rant, continuing with, “Nigga talked all that Shit just to back down and not sign the paper work. Not about that life. No action. Don’t wanna hear about this ever” and “Now we all know Chris a Bitch don’t bring this shit up to me ever again. He ain’t wanna see these hands. Facts.” \nAccording to a new video, Mr. Deandre Way’s onslaught against Brown isn’t stopping anytime soon. \n“This shit ain’t funny, but it is,” said Soulja in an Instagram video. “This nigga wanted to fight me over this girl and she just put a restraining order on this nigga. He can’t be 100 feet of this girl. Chris take this L, nigga. Everybody suck my dick. Ima take this dub. I’m out.” \nOf course, Soulja was referring to a recent restraining order filed by Brown’s ex-girlfriend, Karrueche Tran . \nAccording to Tran, Chris Breezy physically assaulted her by punching her in the stomach and pushing her down some stairs. This wouldn’t be the first time he’s been accused of violence toward women. In 2009, he was charged with assaulting his then-girlfriend Rihanna following the Grammys.
