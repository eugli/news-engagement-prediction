While watch and ward staff physically carried legislators, DMK MLAs resisted by whatever means they could.\nStalin, when being carried over by marshals, thumped his head with his hands and shook hard his legs resisting removal.\nEarlier, 78-year old DMK leader Duraimurugan played hide and seek with marshals, as he evaded eviction for some time.\nWhile being led out, he managed to come back to the House through the corridors from near main entrance.\nWhen marshalls prevented his entry into the House, he managed to sneak into the press gallery and crossed over to the Opposition benches from there.\nSome MLAs splashed water, and in the commotion two video cameras placed near the Fourth Block fell.\nDMK's Sekar Babu squatted opposite the main entrance to the House along with several of his colleagues.\nHe argued with top officials that they had no legal right to remove a legislator from the House precincts.\nAll the DMK members argued that they would consider leaving the House when the Speaker returned, but were fully evicted finally by 2.50 pm, in time for the House to take up the motion of confidence ten minutes later.\nJournalists had to put up with severe restrictions on their movement at the entry and exit points to the House.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T18:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T18:38:17.081+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
