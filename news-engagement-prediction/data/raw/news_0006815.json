And the others also raised their hand to comment,” Pernia said during an interview with INQ&A on Tuesday evening. \n“Nobody objected. We were all in favor of ratification,” Pernia said. \nThe Neda head said they discussed the country’s access to the climate fund. “My comment was that, whether or not we get access to a climate fund, we will not lose anything by being a member,” he said. “We might as well not want to be left out.” \nDuterte left before the meeting ended to attend the oathtaking of Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) officials and asked Senator Loren Legarda to take over as chair. \nDe Guzman, on the other hand, said there was “no such expressed worry” on the part of the President. \nThe Philippines was among the countries that pushed for the approval of the Paris Agreement and the inclusion of provisions beneficial to climate vulnerable countries during the 2015 climate change negotiations in France.
