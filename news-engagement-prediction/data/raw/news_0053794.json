grand final berth, the Raiders have a golden opportunity to break a 23-year premiership drought. \nCoach Ricky Stuart says it’s a good sign they are tipped to push for the title and admits internal expectations are higher than previous years. \n“You work very hard to have these expectations from people,” Stuart said. “It’s not a bad thing, if you’re tough enough you can handle it.” \nWhile a better-than-expected last season has them in title conversations, Stuart has a blunt assessment of last year’s 14-12 preliminary final exit at the hands of Melbourne. \n“We weren’t good enough last season and this year is now a challenge to see if we are — I can’t answer that yet,” he said. media_camera Canberra stormed into the preliminary final last season. \nThe Green Machine have struggled to string back-to-back finals appearances in recent years with 2002-04 the only time they qualified for the NRL playoffs in consecutive seasons. \nStuart has maintained a commitment to setting the club up for an extended run of success. \n“I publicly said when I got here that my job was to turn this club into a competitive club again and we are so we want to stay competitive,” he said. \nAs a player Stuart was a part of the club’s golden era of the late 1980s and early 1990s, but comparisons between the two groups hold little weight. “We have our own brand, we have our own style,” Stuart said. “I’d be silly to compare individuals or compare teams.” \nMEMBERSHIPS: NRL set for bumper crowds \nThe Raiders’ style has been built on freewheeling attack with last year’s team scoring a club record for points, surpassing the 1994 premiership side. “I think we’ve got our own style both defensively and with our attack,” Stuart said. \n“We’ve got to keep nurturing it and keep growing it.” Jordan Turner has arrived from English Super League side St Helens and has the ability to play in the centres, second row or the halves. \nThe forward pack is set to be boosted by former State of Origin star Dave Taylor, who has been offered a contract after impressing on a train-and-trial deal in the off-season. media_camera Jordan Turner has joined the club from St Helens. \nFormer St George forward Dunamis Lui is another recruit pushing for a spot on the bench. \nWith skipper Jarrod Croker set to miss the early stages of the season with a knee injury, Turner and highly-rated youngster Nick Cotric are in the running to fill in at centre. \nEighteen-year-old Cotric’s speed and footwork helped earn him a fulltime contract, but Stuart doesn’t want to put unnecessary pressure on rising stars by publicly stating they are in line for first-grade selection. \n“I talk to them all the time and they know where they stand,” Stuart said. \nCulture is king under Stuart who is hoping the combination of talent and belief can deliver his beloved Raiders the ultimate success.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T09:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:17:14.219+02:00",
