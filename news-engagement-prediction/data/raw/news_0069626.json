Marco Rubio made sure to skip raucous town halls that have bedeviled his Republican colleagues and announced this week that he was heading to Europe instead. Here’s what Rubio kept under wraps: he quietly returned to his hometown of Miami on Wednesday night — only to attend an event that he kept secret from the public Thursday when a demonstrator found him anyway and tried to confront him on video about why he won’t appear at a town hall.\nStory Continued Below\nRubio skedaddled.\n“Senator, I thought you were in Europe?” the demonstrator asked Rubio in a video first posted by Miami New Times .\n“What?” Rubio replied without breaking stride, prompting the young man to refer to “Missing” posters that activists have begun circulating about Florida's junior senator.\n\"I saw all these missing child posters all over town,” the unidentified man asked. “Are you going to host a town hall? I’m glad you’re ok.”\nRubio: “Good to see you, man.”\n“Are you going to host a town hall? We need to hear from you, Senator,” the demonstrator replied. \nRubio kept walking.\nRubio’s office has previously said that he wouldn’t attend the town halls because they’re stocked with liberal activists, who oppose President Trump’s immigration policies and Republican efforts to dismantled Obamacare. One group held a town hall in Tampa Wednesday night that featured a cardboard cutout of Rubio. \nThe demonstrator asked Rubio if he intended to go to a Miami town hall on Thursday, but Rubio refused to say as he hustled away. \nIn a Monday Facebook post, Rubio and his office abruptly announced he was leaving the country to meet with “heads of state and senior government officials in Germany and France, two countries with upcoming elections who are facing concerns about Russian interference. \nAs a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Appropriations Committee, and Select Committee on Intelligence, Senator Rubio is conducting this official oversight trip to discuss the U.S./E.U. relationship, NATO operations, counter-ISIS activities, foreign assistance programs, and Russian aggression in Europe.”\nThe notice wasn’t posted on his official Senate website. And his office didn’t disclose more details. \nOn Wednesday night, his office refused to say when Rubio would return to the United States. On Thursday, after Miami New Times posted its video, Rubio’s office acknowledged that he had arrived back home the previous night.\nWhile Rubio has been averse to speak publicly about his plans to end Obamacare or to attend town halls, some of his Republican colleagues have been more open. In Arkansas, U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton faced a large meeting of protestors but thanked them for participating in the democratic process. In Florida, U.S. Reps Dennis Ross and Gus Bilirakis faced hostile crowds, but U.S. Reps Ron DeSantis and Francis Rooney have skipped them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T09:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:20:49.073+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
