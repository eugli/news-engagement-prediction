Over 100 stocks registered bullish crossover on MACD during the week. \n\nAnalysts say the benchmark indices could undergo some consolidation, but there will be plenty of stock-specific action to keep the momentum going. \n\n“We are past most of the risk events and after undergoing a lot of ups and downs in last 11 months, the market seems to be in a comfortable position to provide good returns in the days ahead,” Sameet Chavan, Technical Analyst at Angel Broking, told ETMarkets.com. \n\n“The immediate level on the upside would now be at 8,807-8,893, whereas the immediate support will be at 8,672-8,650. Traders are advised to keep following individual stocks to form positional trades on the long side,” he said. \n\nThe Moving Average Convergence and Divergence, popularly known as MACD, is a trend-following momentum indicator, which shows over 100 stocks on BSE witnessed upward crossover on MACD during the week. \n\nMACD is one of the most effective momentum indicators that can be used to spot any change in the short-term trend of the market. \n\nStocks that have witnessed upward crossover on BSE with strong volumes included MTNL , Bombay Dyeing , KEI Industries , Cipla , Gitanjali Gems , Welspun India , JMT Auto , Mawana Sugars , Jubilant LifeSciences and Man Industries , among others. \n\nIn MACD, two exponential moving averages – 12-day and 26-day – of price are used to indicate the direction and momentum of the market, which can either be strong or weak. A nine-day exponential moving average is used as a line to generate a buy or sell signal. \n\nEssentially all indicators are price derives, meaning they are derived out of historical prices and, hence, they more often act as laggards rather than behaving like leading indicators. But it can help assess the direction of the market. \n\nTrack live charts of stocks recording fresh bullish crossover here : \n\n\n\nTo understand MACD, we should understand what is a crossover? When the MACD falls below the signal line, it is a bearish signal, which indicates that it may be time to sell. \n\nOn the contrary, when the MACD rises above the signal line, the indicator gives a bullish signal or a bullish crossover, which suggests further upside in the offing. \n\nThe MACD value is always higher than the signal value. For example, in MTNL, the MACD value is 0.63 and the signal value is 0.41. Another company, Bombay Dyeing whose MACD value is 1,61, was above its signal line value of 1.48. \n\n\n\nHowever, the MACD indicator may not be sufficient to take an investment or trading call. Investors should use other indicators to take decisions, experts said. \n\nAlthough the MACD is effective, it is not complete in itself. Traders should make use of other indicators such as RSI, Fibonacci series, candlestick patterns, Bollinger Bands , and stochastic to confirm any trend.
