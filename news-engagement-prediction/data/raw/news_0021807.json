February 07, 2017 at 11:01AM By Darragh O'Connor , writer at creators.co Beautiful 'Rogue One' poster [Credit: Disney] By Darragh O'Connor , writer at Creators.co My name is Darragh. Enjoy reading what I think about movies. \nWarning: Spoilers for Rogue One: A Star Wars Story to follow! \nThe dust has finally settled, and most of us have seen the first Star Wars anthology movie, Star Wars: Rogue One . Thankfully, the film was exceptional for both fans and critics alike. It gave us a true-to-heart war/espionage story that fits perfectly with the rest of the Star Wars franchise. If you're an avid DVD/Blu-Ray collector, you may want to look towards Amazon.com for some hints as to when we may see this hit our shelves, as they updated the Rogue One release date to March 28th . \nI'm hoping and praying that the special edition will include tons of extras and featurettes, much like the ones we saw on the special edition of The Force Awakens . We'll definitely get a \"making of\" feature, and hopefully we'll get deleted scenes and some hilarious bloopers too! What Deleted Scenes Could We See? [Credit: Disney] \nOn the Blu-Ray for Rogue One, it's quite possible we may see glimpses of what the movie looked like before the reshoots. The Rogue One reshoots caused some concern when they were first announced — thankfully, we now know there was no need to worry, and the reshoots served the film perfectly. But it does make us wonder... What did they reshoot? We could see a version of the film where the cast survive, or maybe a version where only some die? Jyn and Cassian take the plans out of the Citadel [Credit: Disney] \nIn the above picture (which is taken from the first trailer), you can Jyn and Cassian running through a battle-zone with the Death Star plans in Jyn's hands. This is quite suspect, seeing as in the film, those plans never left the facility. In the final cut of Rogue One , Jyn carried the plans from the databank to the top of the tower, then inserted them into the transmitter, and beamed the data to the Rebel fleet. This suggests that they showed an alternate ending in the first trailer. \nDoes this mean our favorite renegade heroes survived in the first cut? Sadly not — the film's director, Gareth Edwards told Empire that no version of the film where the crew survived was filmed: \n\"I kept waiting for someone to go, ‘You know what? Could we just film an extra scene where we see Jyn and Cassian, they’re okay and they’re on another planet?’ And it never came. No one ever gave us that note, so we got to do it.\" \nSee Also: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T18:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:35:47.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
