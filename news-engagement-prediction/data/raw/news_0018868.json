Mr Cook met the Prime Minister at Downing Street this morning to discuss the company's plans to build a new UK headquarters at the redeveloped Battersea Power Station as proof of the company's support of the UK. 'We're doubling down on a huge headquarters in the Battersea area and we're leaving significant space there to expand,' Mr Cook said. 'We're a big believer in the UK - we think you'll be just fine. Yes, there will be bumps in the road along the way but the UK's going to be fine.' Theresa May has hosted Apple chief executive Tim Cook, pictured in Downing Street today, at No 10 for private talks on her Brexit plans Apple boss Tim Cook today visited a primary school in north London as part of his trip to the UK to discuss Brexit with Theresa May Last year the iPhone maker revealed it would move 1,600 employees to the new campus in south London in 2021. In a statement about the meeting, Apple said: 'Tim had a positive meeting with the Prime Minister today, discussing Apple's continued investment in the United Kingdom. 'We are proud that Apple's innovation and growth now supports nearly 300,000 jobs across the UK.'

Mrs May 's 'global Britain' strategy was boosted last year by Apple's announcement it would set up a huge new headquarters in London at the redeveloped Battersea Power Station. The lavish plans raised hopes Apple could abandon its base in Ireland and shift its European operations to Britain in what would be a huge coup for London - and the Treasury. The iPhone and iPad developer was slapped with a vast bill by the European Commission after Brussels ruled against a low corporate tax deal agreed between Apple and Ireland last year. Mr Cook said: 'Technology has moved on considerably. It gets kids a lot more engaged because they're living in a digital world. We're all living in a digital world' Mr Cook, pictured leaving No 10 after his talks, was said to have held 'positive and useful' talks with the PM Revealing details of the meeting, Mrs May's official spokesman said: 'It was a meeting with the Prime Minister. 'It was a very positive and useful discussion. You have seen Apple has made a recent announcement about investment in the UK.
