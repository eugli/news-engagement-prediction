Photo: Emoji Fame Texas lawmaker introduces legislation against Texans using the Chilean flag emoji 1 / 17 Back to Gallery \nA resolution introduced into the Texas state legislature is urging Texans to think twice before using a certain flag emoji. \nHCR 75, \"urging Texans not to use the flag emoji of the Republic of Chile when referring to the Texas flag\" was introduced by Republican State Representative Tom Oliverson from Cypress on Thursday. \n\"Most major electronic messaging applications provide a number of flag emojis, including that of the Republic of Chile, but the official flag of Texas, also known as the Lone Star Flag, is not included in the selection,\" Oliverson wrote in the resolution text . \n#TXLEGE: 85th Texas Legislature issues and players to watch 2017 \nThe fact that Texas doesn't have any built-in emojis (besides the ones you can purchase in an app store) is another problem altogether. \n\"All too often,\" Oliverson wrote \"the Chilean flag emoji is used as a substitute for the Lone Star Flag in text messaging and on social media platforms; the Chilean flag proudly represents its country but, despite its similarity to the Texas flag, it does not represent the State of Texas.\" \nOliverson goes on to describe the Chilean flag (seen here on EmojiPedia ) with its proud history. \nEmoji for sneezing, selfies and more are coming to the iPhone Media: Brandpoint \n\"The colors of the Chilean flag depict sky, snow, and blood spilled while fighting for freedom, but the blue, white, and red of the Lone Star Flag stand for the Texan values of loyalty, purity, and bravery,\" he wrote. \n\"Just as our flag could never fully embody the country of Chile, neither can the Chilean flag inspire feelings of pride and passion in the heart of a true Texan,\" he continued. \nAnd then it gets official. \n\"That the 85th Legislature of the State of Texas hereby reject the notion that the Chilean flag, although it is a nice flag, can in any way compare to or be substituted for the official state flag of Texas and urge all Texans not to use the Republic of Chile flag emoji in digital forums when referring to the Lone Star Flag of the great State of Texas,\" the resolution concludes. \nYour move, emoji makers.
