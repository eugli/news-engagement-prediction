After years of carefully decommissioning our nukes – Obama won the Nobel Prize for that – Trump wants to ramp up nuclear production. It's like the Cold War all over again, but this time, everyone's on Russia's side,\" joking about where Trump's alliance lies. \nColbert pointed out that Trump contrastingly said in the interview, \"I am the first one that would like to see everybody-nobody have nukes.\" \n\"Actually, I think that's how nukes work. First, everybody has them. Then nobody has them. And in-between, there's a big boom.\" \nColbert then teased Trump's declaration that he's getting \"the really bad dudes out of this country\" with a \"military operation,\" even though the Homeland Security chief said no military personnel were used to enforce deportation. White House spokesperson Sean Spicer then explained that Trump had used \"military operation\" like \"an adjective.\" \n\"I'm not an English teacher, but he's using 'military operation' as an adjective,\" Colbert asked. \"Do you like my new haircut? Yes, it's very military operation. Do these pants make my ass look military operation?\" More News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T21:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T16:31:44.984+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
