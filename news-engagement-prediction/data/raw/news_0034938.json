Article continues below \nYep, it turns out the Stoke City striker is actually a bit of a Fantasy Football master. \nHe currently sits top of the Stoke players’ 12-man private Fantasy Football League, with a cool 1,392 points. Impressive. And out of 4,399,020 players in total, he finds himself in 34,331st place. Article continues below Stoke City players' private league \nFirst of all, here’s the Stoke player’s private head-to-head league… \nAs you can see, Crouchy is way in front. He’s the Chelsea of this league, with Charlie Adam playing the role of Manchester City, way behind in second place. Crouch's FPL team \nAnd now let’s take a closer look at the 36-year-old’s team, which is worth £101.2 million… It's strong - but where's Crouch? \nWe have to start by saying it’s a crying shame Crouch doesn’t feature in his own FPL XI. \nInstead, he’s gone for a three-pronged attack featuring Diego Costa, Romelu Lukaku and Jermain Defoe. Strong. \nHis midfield’s decent, too. Alexis Sanchez, Dele Alli, Robert Snodgrass and Adam Lallana. No wonder he’s doing so well. \nAnd in defence he’s got Kyle Walker, Seamus Coleman and Erik Pieters, while his goalkeeper is his teammate Lee Grant. \nHis bench, meanwhile, features Paul Robinson, Gareth McAuley (a bit of a points machine this season), Brad Smith and Joe Allen. Crouch: 'I am flying!' \nWhen asked for a comment by the Stoke Sentinel , Crouch simply replied: “I am flying!” before heading out to Dubai with the rest of the Potters’ squad for some warm weather training this week. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
