Uniting America \nKimmel was quick of the mark, starting off his opening monologue with a look at the divided state of America. \nAfter remarking that most people's advice was that everyone needed to be brought together, he joked that he was not the man to do it. \n\"There's only one Braveheart [Mel Gibson] in the room and he's not going to unite us either.\" 'Smooth move, dumbass' \nIt is no secret that Kimmel has an ongoing feud with Matt Damon. External Link: Matt Damon didn't seem impressed after Jimmy Kimmel called him out at the Oscars \nBut in the spirit of bringing people together at the awards, Kimmel said he would like to \"bury the hatchet\". \nIt also gave him plenty of opportunity to sneak in a few jibes, including a dig at Damon's decision to not star in Manchester By The Sea. \n\"Matt, as you probably know, could have starred in Manchester by the Sea, he was the producer, it's nominated for six Oscars including lead actor, and he could have taken that lead actor part for himself, but he didn't. \n\"He gave that role to Casey Affleck, his childhood friend. He handed what turned out to be an Oscar-calibre role over to his friend, and made a Chinese ponytail movie instead. \n\"And that movie, The Great Wall, went on to lose $80 million. Smooth move, dumbass.\" He made it rain Red Vines \nYes, Jimmy Kimmel made candy drop from the ceiling. \nThe little bundles of Red Vines, Junior Mints and other lollies fell onto the unsuspecting Oscar audience. \nIt was a moment reminiscent of the 2014 Oscars when Ellen DeGeneres delivered pizza to the crowd. Is that an Ivanka? \nKimmel also singled out Meryl Streep for a round of applause at the awards, before asking her where her dress was from. \n\"Nice dress, by the way,\" he said. \n\"Is that an Ivanka?\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T11:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T06:48:56.274+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
