Photo: Disney It’s likely not an exaggeration to say that with Black Panther , Marvel will have more black people onscreen in one film than it managed in the total preceding MCU. Yet, despite Samuel L. Jackson’s placement as one of the most prominent people of color in the Marvel franchise, his Nick Fury is not in Black Panther , a fact that has Jackson irked. Talking to We Got This Covered , Jackson explained: “I asked them, ‘So you’re doing Black Panther and the only black character in the Marvel Universe is not showing up?’ And they’re like, ‘Nick Fury is not in Wakanda!’” That’s not logic that Jackson readily accepted, pressing, “How can he not know the other black superhero on the planet?
