The cast of Moonlight may have had the best night at the Oscars on Sunday. After breaking through the confusion , the film took home the awards for both best picture, and Mahershala Ali also won best supporting actor . While that may have normally signaled the end of new accolades for the cast, they, along with Calvin Klein’s new creative director Raf Simons , still had one more thing to share with the world. The men of Moonlight — Alex Hibbert , Trevante Rhodes , Mahershala Ali, and Ashton Sanders —are the stars of Calvin Klein’s latest underwear campaign. The black-and-white images are Simon’s second official campaign since taking over the label, and his take on the classic C.K. underwear ads . Simons’s selects for the campaign were hinted at during last night’s awards, as he also dressed the cast in Calvin Klein for the ceremony. Moonlight star and best supporting actress nominee Naomie Harris , who wore a Calvin Klein sequined white dress, swept many best dressed lists on Sunday night, while the men weren’t far behind in their classic suits. The new campaign follows a more sophisticated direction for the brand under Simons’s stewardship. Whereas recent Calvin Klein campaigns before Simons relied on known quantities such as Kendall Jenner or Bella Hadid , Simons’s first ads, which were released earlier this month, featured relatively unknown models in underwear surrounded by contemporary art . While the mostly newcomers of the Moonlight cast may be slightly better known, the film’s new hardware is sure to change that in short order.
