New Zealand Brewer's Association \nYou'll be able to find carbohydrate and calorie content on beer labels. \n\"We are aware that beer has a bad rap and there's a lot of misconceptions about it,\" says Kevin Sinnett, director of external relations for the Brewer's Association. \"Most people think beer is high in sugar. This is going to be a big surprise for most punters.\" \nREAD MORE: \nMost beer is 99 per cent sugar free and doesn't contain any preservatives, he says. New Zealand Brewer's Association \nMost beer is 99 per cent sugar free. \nSome of the first breweries to feature nutritional information on their products are Speight's, Steinlager, Mac's, Monteith's, Tui, DB Draft, Heineken, and Waikato Draft. \n\"All beers will be tested 10 times to ensure the nutritional information is correct,\" says Sinnett. \nIngredients' lists will not be printed on labelling, though the Brewer's Association says most beers contain just four ingredients: water, malted barley, hops, and yeast. \nThe beer industry's move heralds a forward-thinking approach that may stimulate the Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) to consider making nutritional labels mandatory for all alcohol on sale in New Zealand. Ad Feedback \n\"I think the thing is for us is, we've recognised that consumers want this kind of information,\" says Sinnett. \nAccording to market research, 75 per cent of people thought nutritional information should be on a bottle of beer. \nIn a Stuff poll of over 3000 readers last week, 83 per cent said they would like to know what they're consuming when it comes to alcohol. \nThe labelling will be added to bottles, cans, and cartons voluntarily by members of the Brewer's Association, including Lion and DB, which have both committed to the initiative. \n\"We're gradually going to see it introduced over the next six months, and expect around 80 per cent of Lion and DB beers to have nutrition labels by August,\" says Sinnett. \nThough no independent breweries have committed to labelling yet, \"we've reached out to the Brewer's Guild and Independent Liquor and hope that little and medium-sized breweries will get on board... it's an open invitation,\" Sinnett confirms. \nThe Brewers Association believes that the more brewers get involved, the better for Kiwi consumers. \n\"It gives people a better idea of what they're drinking, so they can make more informed choices,\" says Sinnett. \nUnder Lion and DB, more than 489 million bottles and cans of beer will hit the shelves in 2017 featuring the new labelling. \nWill the wine and spirits industries follow the beer industry's lead? It's not an explicit goal for the Brewer's Association, but it could pave the way for a new standard in New Zealand. \n\"Obviously, it's up to [wine and spirits producers] to decide,\" says Sinnett. \"We think this is a popular move. Consumers will like it. It may translate to others getting on board.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T13:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T08:26:15.814+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
