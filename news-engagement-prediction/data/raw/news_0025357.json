As head coach of the Gators, Mike White now owns at least one victory against each SEC team besides South Carolina and Vanderbilt after Florida finally defeated TAMU in both teams’ third meeting in two years.\nInstant Analysis now takes a closer look at Florida’s victory.\nIT WAS OVER WHEN: Florida went cold early on in the second half, missing eight straight shots during a stretch where it went 2-of-14 shooting, but the Gators eventually woke up to go on a 12-2 run to retake the lead. After a stretch where Chris Chiozza and Justin Leon each knocked down threes, the Gators took a 65-52 lead with 3:02 left. Texas A&M tried to claw back late, but its deficit was too great as Florida held on in the final minutes to clinch the victory.\nTHEY STOLE THE SHOW: Justin Leon led the way for the Gators with 18 points on 7-of-15 shooting (4-of-8 from three) to go along with five rebounds Saturday. Leon scored seven of Florida’s first nine points of the contest against TAMU. John Egbunu chipped in with a double-double of 11 points and 10 rebounds.\nOn Texas A&M’s end, forward Robert Williams finished with 18 points on 7-of-15 shooting and 12 rebounds for the Aggies.\n* GET TWO MONTHS FOR FREE\n* Florida-Texas A&M game discussion\n* Mike White postgame updates\nTHESE STATS DON'T LIE: Although Florida's four guards, Kasey Hill, Chris Chiozza, KeVaughn Allen and Canyon Barry, combined to go 7-of-23 shooting (30.4%), the rest of the team shot 45.5% from the floor. Meanwhile, Texas A&M went 39.3% from the field and just 22.2% (4 of 18) from three.\nFlorida was out-rebounded 40-34 and outscored in the paint 30-20, but the Aggies committed 20 turnovers to UF's 14. Florida held the edge in bench scoring, 27-6.\nBarry, who notably shoots his free throws underhanded, went 4-of-4 from the free throw line Saturday to increase his streak to 39. Barry’s 39 consecutive free throws made passes Taurean Green’s 37 straight in 2005-06.\nWHAT A PLAY: John Egbunu displayed impressive effort on both sides of the floor for a stretch of plays that would make the highlight reel. After Egbunu swatted a jumper, point guard Chris Chiozza took control of the ball but struggled with his handle. However, he’d maintain his dribble and then loft the ball from half court, finding Egbunu for the alley-oop slam to give the Gators a 24-13 lead with 6:29 left in the first half.\nTHE BOTTOM LINE: Florida's finish to the game was encouraging, but the rest of it wasn't. The Gators looked sloppy early on during the noon tip, and the offense often struggled with shot selection and trying to figure out TAMU's zone defense. However, Florida managed to pull off the victory against Texas A&M, whose 11 losses have all come to KenPom.com top-100 teams. The NCAA Tournament selection committee announced Saturday that Florida right now stands at No. 11 overall (and as a No. 3 seed), and Saturday's win should still only help the cause.\nNEXT UP: Florida will spend the next week on the road, as it will square off against Auburn on Tuesday night at 7 p.m. ET on the SEC Network and then face Mississippi State on Saturday at 2 p.m. ET on ESPN.\n-", "external_links": ["https://res-2.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/i78mkduh9k8wwcsy6r3b", "https://res-3.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/eli9fqb4wsigd8xodul1", "https://res-3.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/eli9fqb4wsigd8xodul1)", "https://res-2.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/i78mkduh9k8wwcsy6r3b)"], "published": "2017-02-11T21:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T07:29:33.407+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
