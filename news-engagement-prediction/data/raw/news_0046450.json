(Chris O'Meara/AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Saturday, February 18, 2017, 10:37 PM \nNothing happened \"last night in Sweden\" quite like President Trump suggested during his campaign-esque speech Saturday but apparently he has been watching Fox News again. \nTrump name dropped the Scandinavian country while criticizing the open border policies of Germany, Belgium and France to advocate for stricter entry to the United States. All three countries have faced several terrorist attacks linked to Islamic State militants. \n\"You look at what's happening in Germany, you look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this. Sweden,\" Trump said. \"They took in large numbers. They're having problems like they never thought possible.\" \nHe continued: \"You look at what's happening in Brussels. You look at what's happening all over the world. Take a look at Nice. Take a look at Paris. We've allowed thousands and thousands of people into our country and there was no way to vet those people. There was no documentation. There was no nothing. So we're going to keep our country safe.\" Fox News host Tucker Carlson interviews Ami Horowitz for a segment that aired Friday night. (Fox News) \nHis perplexing remark on Sweden comes within a day of Fox News airing an interview between host Tucker Carlson and documentary filmmaker Ami Horowitz, who attempts to correlate a crime surge in Sweden on droves of asylum seekers. The segment aired around 9 p.m. on Friday, hours after Trump started his weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate. \nIn the interview, Horowitz attempts to explain Sweden's \"moral duty\" to house asylum seekers and claimed an uptick in gun violence and a \"rash of rapes at musical festivals\" is because of the nation's open border policy. \nSwedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter notes that Trump's remark suggests that something happened \"last night in Sweden\" but it's \"unclear\" what Trump was referring to at the Orlando Melbourne International Airport.

Working in Sweden requires a residency permit, the paper reported. \nAs millions of migrants flocked to Europe to escape their war-torn countries in 2015, Sweden followed Germany and Hungary in third for receiving the most asylum applications, according to Pew Research. The data notes that Sweden was the most popular destination for \"unaccompanied asylum seekers under age 18\" in 2015 and that in that year, the nation accepted more refugees than France and the UK combined.
