He not only has an incredible NASCAR family legacy to live up to, but he also needs and wants to build on it. \nSo he's approaching his first Daytona 500 as a way to prove he's a quality driver and not just riding the coattails of his grandfather, Dale Earnhardt Sr., and Dale Jr., who will race with him Sunday in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series season opener at the Daytona International Speedway. \n\"It sucks when you see it on social media - people saying, 'He's just there because of his last name,' 'If it wasn't for his last name, he wouldn't be racing,'\" Jeffrey said. \"I don't want to feel like I've had things handed to me. I want to feel like I've earned it, and people thinking I'm here because I can actually drive, not because of who I am.\" \nFor the first time since 2001, two Earnhardts will be on the track together with Jeffrey behind the wheel of the No. 33 Chevrolet for Circle Sport with The Motorsports Group, along with Dale Jr. returning to his No. 88 Chevrolet . \nClearly, racing has the tendency to be generational, so while drivers still have to prove their worth, they often have that chance to do so if their family is involved, veteran driver Casey Mears said. \n\"You're knowledgeable about the sport, you understand how it works, you understand the right people to talk to, [and] there are inadvertent opportunities that open up just because you are around,\" said Mears, who's the descendant of former IndyCar drivers Roger and Rick Mears. \"You're never handed the sport, but the doors are open to have those conversations.\" \nDespite making it this far, Jeffrey still knows he has his work cut out for him, especially if he wants to beat his uncle on Sunday. He said although the two haven't talked much recently, they'll probably catch up a couple times before the race. \n\"I've got a lot of respect to earn from drivers, I've got a lot to learn from drivers [and] I've got a lot to focus on throughout the race,\" Jeffrey said. \"It's going to be tough, and there's going to be a lot of pressure. I've just got to figure out how to manage that.\" Read or Share this story: http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/02/jeffrey-earnhardt-dale-earnhardt-jr-daytona-500-nascar-daytona-international-speedway-nascar-family-legacy/ Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T09:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:46:16.753+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
