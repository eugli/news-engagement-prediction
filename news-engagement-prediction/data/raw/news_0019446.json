Photo: Getty Images \nOthers acted to cast themselves as white hats amidst the political tumult – Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz promised to hire 10,000 refugees over the coming five years and \nAirbnb pitched in with an offer of free housing to people displaced by the ban. \nSergey Brin, a one-time refugee and a co-founder of Google, which is one of 100 Silicon Valley tech companies to join the legal challenge to Trump's crackdown, was on the front lines, protesting at a San Francisco airport. \nHaving taken down Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus, GrabYourWallet's next big target is the ubiquitous American retail institution Macey's, amidst reports of staff unrest and mounting pressure within the company to dump the Trump brands. \nMeanwhile, LL Bean, sellers of outdoor clothing and sports gear, was paddling backwards in a bid to distance itself from a private donation by a member of the Bean family, of more than $US60,000 to the pro-Trump Make America Great Again PAC. \nEnding up on GrabYourWallet's boycott list, the company claimed politically neutrality. But its position was not helped by Trump, who tweeted in the weeks before his inauguration: \"Thank you to Linda Bean of L.L. Bean for your great support and courage. People will support you even more now. Buy L.L. Bean.\" \nBoth Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus spun their decisions on the grounds that sales of the Trump products were slow, but the louder message was that they understood that associating with the Trump brands risked corrosion of their own brands. \nIn that, it was difficult to assess the impact on the sale of the Trump gear. \nIn a statement, Rosemary K. Young, a senior director of marketing at Ivanka Trump insisted: \"The Ivanka Trump brand continues to expand across categories and distribution with increased customer support, leading us to experience significant year-over-year revenue growth in 2016.\" \nThere are also warnings to corporations that, as the election demonstrated, the Trumps do have a support base to be reckoned with. There is not the fire that GrabYourWallet had generated, but there is a pro-Trump social media move for counter boycotts of Nordstrom, Starbucks and the rest. \nRetailers and coffee chains reckon with a clientele who are voters. But the likes of Lockheed Martin and their shareholders are more susceptible to presidential pressure because the US government is one of their key customers. \nShares in Lockheed Martin dropped 2 per cent in December, when Trump slammed the company over the cost of its fighter jets. And General Motors and Toyota shares were off marginally when he locked horns with them over the assembly of vehicles for the US market in Mexico. \nInvestor sentiment is ephemeral at the best of times. Trump's earlier corporate victims all recovered in time. \nAnd Kimberly Whitler, a marketing professor at the University of Virginia, believes that with the passing of time, \"consumers become numb to a message and at some point, with the velocity of Trump's tweets, it's likely that investors may become more 'numb' to his tweets and react in a more muted fashion.\" \nIn the case of Nordstrom, it's worth noting that if Trump's supporters were mostly older men who had not darkened the doors of a college, the demographic profile of the store chain's clientele tends to be female, millennial to middle age and higher income-earners. \nA Twitter storm of support form Nordstrom in the wake of Trump's reprimand to the store chain might have had something to do with its shares rallying so immediately.
