Romania can't be split into two. Right now Romania seems broken in two. My last desire is to witness this,\" Grindeanu said, referring to the public disgust at the decree which brought hundreds of thousands onto the streets every day since it was passed. \nWhile he made the announcement live on television, some of the anti-corruption protesters outside his office, which police estimated at 170,000, chanted: \"Resign! Resign!\" and waved the Romanian flag. \nThe decree, seen by its critics as the biggest retreat on reforms since Romania joined the European Union in 2007, would have exempted abuse-of-power offences involving sums below 200,000 lei ($48,000) from prosecution - shielding hundreds of officials from justice. \nIt could have put an end to the ongoing trial of the head of the ruling Social Democrats (PSD) Liviu Dragnea, viewed as the real power behind Grindeanu's government which took office last month. \nDragnea, whose conviction for electoral fraud barred him from office, is accused of using his political influence to secure state salaries for two people working at his party headquarters between 2006 and 2013. He denies wrongdoing. \nDozens of political figures from all parties stood to benefit from the decree. \nNine Western powers including Germany and the United States said they were deeply concerned the decree could undermine Romania's partnerships in the EU and NATO « ‘Why go on safari when you can come here?’ Talks on Marsa race track privatisation shrouded in mystery » Advert \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T20:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T16:02:09.272+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
