He then claimed that the only reason she said she had Native American origins was due to her 'high cheekbones', a source told the network.\nTrump 's comment came the day after GOP senators silenced Warren on the Senate floor by invoking a little-used rule while she spoke out against Jeff Sessions during his confirmation hearing to become attorney general.\nThe rebuke has prompted a wave of support for Waren among outraged Democrats.\nDonald Trump referred to Elizabeth Warren as Pocahontas again as he attacked her ancestry during a private meeting with senators, sources said Saturday\nThe president used the 'Pocahontas' insult several times during the closed-door meeting with senators, making it 'equal parts bizarre and completely awkward', a source told CNN.\nHis renewed use of the insult came as Trump reflected on the current state of the Democratic Party.\nThe mogul has previously referred to Warren as Pocahontas and attacked her over her heritage repeatedly.\n'Pocahontas is not happy. She's not happy. She's the worst,' he said in June at a rally in Richmond, Virginia. 'I'm doing such a disservice to Pocahontas, it's so unfair to Pocahontas. But this Elizabeth Warren, I call her goofy Elizabeth Warren, she's one of the worst senators in the entire United States Senate.'\nHis insult referred to Warren's previous statements saying she has Native American origins, which her opponents challenged during her run for Senate in 2012, when she became the first woman to hold the office in Massachusetts.\nWarren had at one point referred to her grandfather's high cheekbones to support her comments.\nTrump's comment came the day after GOP senators silenced Warren on the Senate floor by invoking a little-used rule while she spoke out against Jeff Sessions\nThe Massachusetts Senator's rebuke during Sessions' confirmation hearing Wednesday has drawn outrage among Republicans.\nShe was reading a letter by Martin Luther King Jr's widow, Coretta Scott King, opposing Sessions' ultimately unsuccessful nomination to a federal judgeship in 1986.\nThe GOP majority voted to silence her under a little-used Senate regulation, Rule 19, which bars any senator from impugning the motives of any other or imputing 'any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming of a senator.'\nSeveral male Democratic senators stood up and read from the same letter but without drawing objections, leading Democratic activists to proclaim that Senate Republicans were interested only in silencing a woman.\nDemocrats accused Republicans of selectively enforcing Rule 19. They noted the GOP did not apply it when, for example, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas accused Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of lying in relation to a dispute over the Export-Import Bank two years ago.\nThe moment inspired a Twitter hashtag, #LetLizSpeak, and clips from C-SPAN2 went viral.\n'ShePersisted' trended on Twitter after Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said: 'Senator Warren was giving a lengthy speech. She had appeared to violate the rule. She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted.'\nHillary Clinton picked up on the Quote: on Twitter, adding: 'So must we all.'\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell said: 'Senator Warren was giving a lengthy speech.
