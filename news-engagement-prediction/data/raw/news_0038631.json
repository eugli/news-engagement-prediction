Daddy came to play. First of all, you’re all fake news, I hate you all very much, and thank you for being here.” \nHe provided responses that didn’t directly address the questions, “We’ve made so much progress. In fact, if you ask any American, they’ll say that I’ve managed to make the last four weeks feel like four years,” he said and then chanted, “Four more weeks! Four more weeks! Four more weeks!” \nWhen asked if he knew about Flynn’s conversations with Russian diplomats, Fallon’s Trump responded, “Look, I knew that he knew that I knew, but he didn’t know that I knew that he knew that I knew that he knew that I knew that he knew. So now you know.” \nWATCH BELOW: Trump lashes out mainstream media again \nWhen a “CNN reporter” asked a question Fallon’s Trump attacked, “Fake news! Fake news. Oooh, fake! In fact, I’m not even calling it fake news anymore. I’ve thought of something new. I changed the name. I’m now calling it faux news.” \nFallon pulled out a Magic 8-ball to answer questions about his administration’s contact with Russia and announced that Beyoncé will replace U.S. Labor Secretary nominee Andrew Puzder because “who knows more about going into labour than someone carrying twins.” \n“One more shake, and this is going to make the ratings go through the roof,” Fallon’s Trump said while shaking his Magic 8-ball. \n“Faux news, cue the music,” he said as Migos’ Bad and Boujee began to play. \nSome people on social media noted that the Trump jokes are getting “old.” @jimmyfallon @joelmchale @ZoeKravitz @TheRyanAdams boycotting the tonight show due to bad Trump jokes. \n— Johnny Ison (@jison1970) February 17, 2017 @jimmyfallon The Trump shtick is getting so old-same old crap every night. The cold open last night was unwatchable. Give it a rest! \nMany other people took to Twitter to praise Fallon’s impression. Idk I like @ABFalecbaldwin 's Trump impression but @jimmyfallon absolutely nails it with the rambling nonsense ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T17:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T18:06:12.786+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
