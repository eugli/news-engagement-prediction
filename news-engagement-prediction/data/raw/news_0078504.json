Then he lost his home. \n“I was in a car for about 60 days just absorbing the impact,” Reid told CBS2 Monday. \nReid said he was able to get back to full-time employment with the help of Chrysalis, a nonprofit that helped 2,300 homeless people find work last year in Los Angeles County. \n“There are so many people who walk through our doors every day who are just dying to work,” Chrysalis CEO Mark Loranger said. \nLoranger says his organization could help even more homeless people find work if he had more case managers to serve them. That, he says, is where Measure H comes in. \n“If we’re going to solve this problem, not just with band aids, we need to invest,” Loranger said. \nLoranger says there are safeguards built into the measure for accountability, including a citizen’s advisory committee and an annual audit. The money can only be used for homeless services. \nThere is no organized opposition campaign for Measure H, but it does have its critics. \n“This is just another assault on our wallets,” said Jack Humphreville with LA Watch Dog. \nHumphreville says the county should come up with the money inside its own $30 billion budget rather than ask taxpayers to foot the bill. \n“If this is a No. 1 priority for them, which they’ve said a number of times, then it should be a budget priority it shouldn’t be a No. 1 tax priority,” Humphreville said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T13:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T11:04:00.692+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
