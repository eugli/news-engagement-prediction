But after a decade of grinding battle in China's courts, the president was expected to get an unlikely win this week: the rights to his own name. \nTrump's late victory in the fight to wrest back one sliver of his brand -- the trademark for building construction services -- could signal a shift in fortune for the U.S. president's intellectual property in China. At stake are 49 pending trademark applications -- all made during his campaign -- and 77 marks already registered in his name, most of which will come up for renewal during his term. The case also raises the possibility that the president could claw back control of more than 225 Trump-related marks in China that do not belong to him.

Bush, called the situation \"highly improper.\" Since foreign governments know Trump cares deeply about his family's business, Painter said, \"they will give him what he wants and they will expect stuff in return.\" \nEisen and Painter are involved in a lawsuit alleging that Trump's foreign business ties violate the U.S. Constitution. Trump has dismissed the lawsuit as \"totally without merit.\" \nAlan Garten, chief legal officer of The Trump Organization, said the Chinese trademarks were already in the works before the election, and the president has turned management of his company over to his children and a team of executives. \nIn an email, Garten wrote, \"The only mark we were seeking was one in the related class of construction which someone was improperly squatting on.\" \nThe precise value of the trademarks is a matter of debate, but Trump himself thought his brands in China were worth enough to defend them, according to a 2011 letter he wrote then-Commerce Secretary Gary Locke about a trademark dispute in Macau, an autonomous region of China.

It didn't work. Trump railed against the courts as \"faithless, corrupt and tainted.\" \n\"The Trump name resonates throughout the entire world,\" Trump wrote. \"According to their ignorant council of judges, it appears the only two places in the world I am not well known are China and Macao,\" he added, using an alternative spelling. \nThat may be changing. \nAs president, Trump's elevated profile in China will likely make it easier to protect his brand, said Zhou Dandan, a lawyer with Unitalen Attorneys at Law in Beijing, which has worked for Trump since 2006. Trademark authorities will almost certainly reject new \"Trump\" applications from unrelated parties, she said, and may take back rights from existing \"Trump\" trademark holders. \nThat's what happened in the case nearing completion this week. \nTrump applied for rights to the Trump mark for construction services on Dec. 7, 2006, but a man named Dong Wei had filed a similar application about two weeks earlier. China works on a first-come-first-served basis for trademarks, and the Trademark Office rejected Trump's application.

He lost, lost and lost again. \nSeparately, he tried to invalidate Dong's trademark, but failed, and failed again on appeal, according to Matthew Dresden, a China intellectual property attorney at Harris Bricken in Seattle, who has studied the case. \nThe last time courts ruled against Trump in the construction-services case was May 2015, the month before he declared his candidacy. \nThen Trump's lawyers simply went back to the Trademark Review and Adjudication Board, which had already rejected their case, and again asked them to invalidate Dong's trademark, Dresden said. \nThis time it worked. On Sept. 6, 2016, the Trademark Office published its invalidation of Dong's trademark for construction services. Dong could not be reached for comment. \nThat decision cleared the way for Trump's own claim to move ahead. Trump's mark was published in China's Trademark Gazette on Nov. 13, less than a week after he won the presidential election. Interested parties have three months to object. If no one does, the trademark will be registered to Trump on Tuesday. \nWhy is Trump winning in China's bureaucracy now, after years of failure? China's State Administration for Industry and Commerce and its foreign ministry did not reply to requests for comment. \nSome lawyers point to a general hardening in China's stance on trademark squatting. In January, China's Supreme People's Court released a legal interpretation stipulating that names of \"political, economic, cultural, religious, national and other public figures\" should not be trademarked. That notice came after a December ruling returned the Chinese version of Michael Jordan's name from Qiaodan Sports Co. to the basketball star. In Mandarin, Qiaodan sounds like Jordan.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) AP \nOthers say politics almost certainly played a role. By 2016, the nature of the dispute had changed. Chinese authorities were now ruling on a case that pitted a guy from Liaoning province against a man running for president of the United States. \n\"It would be hard to imagine that the judges, the Trademark Office and/or the Trademark Review and Adjudication Board were acting without some kind of guidance,\" said Dan Plane, a director at Simone IP Services, a Hong Kong intellectual property consultancy. \nHe added that the outcome of future cases could depend on Trump's relationship with Beijing. \n\"If there's a clear decision made by an angry Chinese government to stop giving broad protection to the Trump name in China, Trump's ability to defend or enforce his name could be quite limited,\" Plane said. \nMeanwhile, the makers of Trump-branded luxury toilets at Shenzhen Trump Industrial Co. face a potent new potential adversary. They say they will defend their brand, even if it means taking on the U.S. president. \nCo-founder Zhong Jiye said his Trump toilet, which dates to 2002, has nothing to do with President Trump. The Chinese name brings together ideas of innovation and popularity, he explained. And in English, the \"U\" makes a nice toilet-seat shape logo. \nTrump toilets for the home can do pregnancy tests, while models for public use have disposable seat covers for improved hygiene. The company says sales were up more than 50 percent last year and an international expansion is in the works -- perhaps under a different brand now that Trump is president. \nPeople use Trump toilets some 100 million times a year, Zhong said. \nAmong them, he added, are customers at Zhongnanhai, the official residence of Chinese President Xi Jinping. \n- By ERIKA KINETZ / Associated Press View Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T06:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:35:07.445+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
