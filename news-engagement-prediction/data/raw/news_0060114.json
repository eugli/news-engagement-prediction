'We're not pitching against one another,' she elaborated. 'And we're not being pitted against other judges. It's just relaxed and fun.' The pitching and pitting that Dannii spoke of refers to the style of The X Factor and The Voice - which Let It Shine has replaced in the schedules following The Voice's move from the BBC to ITV. Doting mum: The 45-year-old selected the show - which is the brainchild of Gary Barlow - so as to tie-in specifically with her son Ethan's school schedule Sing it sister: Dannii and Kylie joined forces to perform together for the first time in years on The X Factor Australia The constant pantomime-esque sniping between judges - which is admittedly normally in jest - is clearly something the singer is happy to step away from. 'Let It Shine is based on the performers, not us,' she said, referring to herself and her fellow judges Gary and Martin Kemp. 'It's about the performance.' The former pop star went on to reveal how she hasn't backed one act in particular through the series, and that she can easily change her mind from one episode to the next. 'There's no clear front-runner,' Dannii said of the three remaining groups, Nightfall, Drive and Five To Five - all of whom are battling it out to win a place as the boy band in the forthcoming Take That musical. 'These boys have to be cut out for this kind of performing. It's not about just being a pop artist. They've got to be able to handle eight shows a week.' Dannii has herself performed in musical theatre, including a touring production of Grease, which traveled across the entirety of Australia. Veteran judge: Having sat on the panels for both The X Factor UK and Australia, the musician explained that her latest TV project has lacked the on-screen sniping between judges that certain other programmes encourage (pictured at the BBC Worldwide Showcase) Shining bright: Dannii is a member of the Let It Shine panel along with Martin Kemp and Gary Barlow (Ashley Roberts is also pictured) Talented team: Dannii said she hoped to be at the opening when the musical launches later in the year, schedule permitting, and has revealed that there could be scope for a second season Dannii said she hoped to be at the opening when the musical launches later in the year, schedule permitting, and has revealed that there could be scope for a second season. 'Nothing's been confirmed...but I'm open to it. I would love to work with this team again,' she said. Of her time in the UK, Dannii said that she has mostly been seeing her various god-children that are based in England; but hasn't crossed paths with anyone from her X Factor days. 'I know nothing about Cheryl,' she said about her former co-judge on the ITV series, but seemed happy for the mum-to-be. As X Factor alumnus, Dannii said that she and Gary still enjoy the series, and that Gary still watches the UK version when its on. No reunion? Of her time in the UK, Dannii said that she has mostly been seeing her various god-children that are based in England; but hasn't crossed paths with anyone from her X Factor days The former Home And Away Star did admit that it's unlikely she would return to The X Factor going forward - and that her top priority is most definitely what suits her young son. She did reveal her thoughts about what is widely considered The X Factor's best judging panel of her, Cheryl, Simon Cowell and Louis Walsh. 'It was an exciting time, and the viewing figures showed that,' she said. Of her career as a recording artist, the star didn't rule out releasing new music sometime soon. 'I love music, I've been back in the studio. I've dipped in and out of it now I have more time to,' she teased. Menioning her sister Kylie, 48, Dannii hinted that another duet could be on the cards for songstress siblings. 'We did it for [song] 100 degrees,' she concluded. 'There might be something in the works. Watch this space.' Collaboration on the horizon?
