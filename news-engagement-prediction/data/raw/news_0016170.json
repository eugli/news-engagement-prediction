Townsend shone for Benitez in last season's doomed battle against the drop... (Photo: Reuters) ...and the Spaniard wanted him back, but he has stayed at Crystal Palace (Photo: PA) \nAnd he is concerned that, even if he is still in control, there is little point if the club won’t pay the money for players he believed were needed to bolster their bid for an instant return to the top flight after last season's relegation. \nBenitez will hold showdown talks over his future in the summer. \nHe will demand strong guarantees that he can rebuild the club into one that can challenge for the top half of the Premier League – if they do get promoted in May – without interference from other club employees. \nChief scout Graham Carr still wields influence, and sat next to owner Mike Ashley at the FA Cup third round tie at Birmingham in early January. Benitez is fretting over whether Carr has acted as a brake on his transfer wish list. \nHe was baffled why Newcastle didn’t land Townsend , who he believed would return to Tyneside for £13m — the size of the deal that took him from Tyneside to Crystal Palace in the summer. The Magpies do look like going up, but what will Ashley do if/when they get there? (Photo: MirrorPix) \nWhen the transfer window slammed shut on Tuesday, Benitez observed: “I said we were ready to sign players at the beginning of January but after we didn’t do anything.” \nThe Spaniard has been left wondering why Ashley, who he has had a relatively productive relationship with, swayed from solid promises made in the summer about transfer strategy. \nHave the club clawed back some power, or are they simply keeping their powder dry for a splurge ahead of an assault on the top flight? \nThe 56-year-old former Valencia, Liverpool, Inter Milan, Chelsea, Napoli and Real Madrid boss has dealt with difficult owners in the past, and knows internal club politics comes with the job. \nHe is happy to be responsible, and accountable, for all signings made, and doesn’t want his ambitious plans to be blocked. Newcastle are on course to go back up — but Benitez wants to build a top-flight force (Photo: PA) \nBenitez is proud of his transfer record so far at Newcastle. He believes he has achieved a 70 per cent hit rate and that represents an excellent return. \nDwight Gayle, Matt Ritchie and Isaac Hayden have been big hits and might fetch double their summer fees. Ciaran Clark has done well. Others were bought to do a job in the Championship and provide cover, and have not lost value. \nThe two mistakes are probably keeper Matz Sels and full-back Jesus Gamez, but they are hardly disasters of Remy Cabella or Florian Thauvin standard. \nWhatever the politics, the club has taken a major gamble in recruiting no new players, as rivals have plugged gaps in their teams and became stronger. Cabella arrived in an £8m deal — he managed ONE goal for Newcastle (Photo: Getty) \nBenitez is likely to have job offers elsewhere come June, and West Ham have been interested in the recent past. He has a strong loyalty to the Geordie fans who have invested faith in his regime, but that could be tested. \nThere is no chance of him quitting now, and he refused to make his full feelings about the situation known in public. \nDespite his misgivings, he has spoken of creating a positive atmosphere to help his players win promotion and “become heroes” on Tyneside. \nHe said: “We have to stick together. Win promotion and they will be heroes, they will be famous. \n“We have to bring the best from the players we have and keep winning games. Obviously we can’t change anything. We have to lead the players and make sure they are ready for the next match.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T01:09:09.472+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
