Asda starts stocking tomato ketchup in the FRIDGE \nThe supermarket will have some of its own-brand bottles on shelves and some refrigerated By HANNAH CROUCH Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Comments ASDA is stocking tomato ketchup in the fridge following a poll which asked people where they prefer to store the popular condiment. \nThe supermarket will have some of its own-brand bottles on shelves and some refrigerated, to see which customers prefer. Cascade News An Asda store in London is planning on stocking bottles of tomato ketchup in the fridge Cascade News Bottles of the condiment will still be stocked on the shelves at room temperature \nThe trial is taking place at its Clapham Superstore in south west London. \nIt follows fierce social media exchanges over where ketchup belongs. \nThe retailer’s own poll showed 53 per cent favouring the fridge against 47 per cent who opt for room temperature. \nSome experts say ketchup used to contain more salt which acted as a preservative. \nLower salt recipes require more refrigeration, and even then it should be used within eight weeks.

However its stability after opening can be affected by storage conditions. We recommend that this product, like any processed food, be refrigerated after opening. Refrigeration will maintain the best product quality after opening.” In response to the question – Should Ketchup be refrigerated? – Heinz advised the condiment should be put in the fridge once opened \nThe debate has sparked a range of emotions on social media. \nOne Twitter user said: “I could never be with someone that keeps their ketchup in the cupboard not the fridge.” \nAnother added: “If you keep ketchup in the pantry, you’re an animal and there’s no room for you in civilised society.” \nBut someone else replied: “Have you ever had cold ketchup at a restaurant? Nope. Belongs in the pantry.” \nOther foods such as bread, tomatoes and coffee were recently listed as foods which can be ruined if they are placed in the fridge . \nA loaf will go stale faster in an airless fridge rather than in a bread bin, according to the Good House-keeping Institute, while tomatoes lose taste. \nOnions and garlic taint other foods in a fridge — whereas fresh coffee will absorb smells. \nLast year it was also revealed what exactly the “57 Varieties” slogan of Heinz Tomato Ketchup actually means . \nAt the time, Heinz was manufacturing more than 60 products – but founder Henry Heinz wasn’t a fan of this number. \nSo, he chose his lucky number 57 instead.
