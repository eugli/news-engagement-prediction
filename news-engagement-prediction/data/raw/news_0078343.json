You don't have to lift heavy to be a powerlifter, just do the compound movement.\"\nHtee has a sponsor who helps out with travel and training and she works at Goodlife in downtown St. John's as a trainer. Right now her sights are set on the Arnold Schwarzenegger Classic in Ohio in the first week of March.\nYou can see Htee training in the video below.\nSt. John's powerlifter hopes to lift her way into the record books 2:05", "external_links": ["http://arnold.usapowerlifting.com/schedule-of-events/"], "published": "2017-02-28T04:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T03:46:18.907+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
