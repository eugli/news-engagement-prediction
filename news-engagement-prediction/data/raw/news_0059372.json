They think of Sydney,\" he said. \n\"We had much debate about that, we thought we might even write to Sydney Mardi Gras and suggest they were not doing the right thing with the name, but we thought that would be ridiculous so we just pressed on. \n\"People come to us and say: 'You're holding a Mardi Gras in Loxton?' We find ourselves a little defensive.\" Photo: Carla and Peter Magarey's home is transformed into an organisational hub as volunteers plan for the mardi gras. (ABC Riverland: Catherine Heuzenroeder) Initial Loxton Mardi Gras was to fund a pool \nThe Sydney Mardi Gras was first held in 1978 as a show of solidarity for international gay celebrations and was met with police violence . \nIt was the catalyst for civil rights reform and has become a major event for LGBTQI and mainstream communities, with this year's parade to be held on March 4. \nFor its part, the Loxton Mardi Gras has also played an important role in the fabric of its community. \n\"It has a long history, it has had a significant contribution into the economic and cultural wellbeing of our community and is a drawcard to our region,\" Mr Magarey said. \nWWII flight engineer Harry Tickle founded the event as a means to raise money for a swimming pool. \nThe proud townsman had observed religious Mardi Gras festivals during his time serving in Europe. \n\"Harry Tickle was an interesting chap. He was a flight engineer with the Royal Australian Airforce on 'G for George', probably Australia's most famous aeroplane outside the Southern Cross.\" \nSince its inception the Loxton Mardi Gras has raised about $1 million for its community, funding the town's swimming pool, playgrounds, supporting aged care facilities and helping to secure a pedal prix event.

I think I was very proud to be queen of the Mardi Gras. I think there might have been a bit of jealousy [among other girls],\" Ms Auld said. \nWhile the event has survived six decades, there have been tough years as the community struggled through economic downturns. \n\"The 1980s with the big drought was a very difficult time and in fact we are in a very difficult time right now, looking ahead,\" Mr Magarey said. \nThere are no guarantees the town will be able to continue its proud tradition as it struggles to maintain enough volunteers to stage the festival. \n\"What we are now addressing is the current community attitude to volunteering,\" Mr Magarey said. \n\"Can we find in Loxton sufficient volunteers to participate in Mardi Gras 61?\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T03:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:03:38.242+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
