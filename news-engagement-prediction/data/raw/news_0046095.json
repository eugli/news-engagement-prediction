I think I'm a great player,\" said Johnson after Sunday's victory in California. \"To finally get a win at Riviera feels good because I've finished second here a couple of times, lost in a play-off, and felt I should have won a couple of other times.\" \nNearly seven hours of play were lost during Friday's storms with the second round delayed by a further two hours on Saturday to clear up the course. \nJohnson was unable to start his third round on Saturday evening as bad light suspended play 17 minutes before he was scheduled to tee off. \nBut the American continued his fine form from the first two rounds, dropping only two shots over the entire weekend. \nVictory preserves Johnson's record of having won at least once in each of the 10 seasons he has been a professional. \nThe Masters, the first major of the year, takes place in Augusta from 6-9 April.
