Abrams doesn't know who's going to win the Academy Award for best actor on Sunday, but he predicts Mark Hamill will be in the running next year after “ The Last Jedi ” hits theaters. \n“I think we are all going to be very upset if he does not win an Oscar, and no one more upset than Mark,” he told us at the Oscar Wilde Awards in L.A., which supports the U.S. Ireland Alliance. Mark Hamill, seen here in the \"Empire Strikes Back,\" could be Oscar bound. But impossible to see, the future is. (AP) \nHamill, who first played Luke Skywalker in the 1977 film “Star Wars,” has reprised the role of the heroic Jedi Knight in three other films, including 2015’s “The Force Awakens” in which he appears for one minute and says nothing. \nMark Hamill uses Joker's voice to read Trump's Meryl Streep tweet \nAfter seeing a still photo from the set of the upcoming film this week, Hamill tweeted at Abrams: \n“Slowly turn, remove hood, but don't start your lengthy Oscar-worthy monologue until you get to that rock over there.” \n\"Star Wars\" fans will have to wait until December to see whether or not that monologue is indeed Oscar-worthy. \n“He is hysterically funny,” Abrams says of his star. “He has done comedy. He is an amazing guy — he can do anything.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:23:11.184+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
