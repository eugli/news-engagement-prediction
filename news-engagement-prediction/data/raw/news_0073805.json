Dubai sees thousands of expats every month who come in to explore the opportunities in the city. Dubai is ranked among the top cities in terms of expat experience. Having a Dubai job stint in your resume increases your chances of getting the next big break. So, if you have been contemplating moving to the emirate for a job hunt, follow our guide: To fly or not to fly There are two distinct thoughts about finding a job in Dubai - either you start hunting for a job from your home country or land in Dubai to find one. The common practice for most is landing at a relative's place and beginning your search on a visit visa. However, it is preferred that you start planning at least three months in advance before your visit so that you can gauge the market and have some leads before arriving. Explore your contacts and may be line up some interviews during the dates you are going to be here. If possible, extend your visa to squeeze in more during your visit. 7 things to consider before moving to Dubai Favourable months Job hiring keeps happening through the year as per the needs of the company. Avoid coming during the holy month of Ramadan as the working hours tend be short and December as people are away on holidays. Also, do consider the temperatures in Dubai before landing as you might rely on the public transport to attend your interviews and a non-summer month would be preferable. Upgrade yourself You need to remember that 80 per cent of jobs in Dubai are taken by the expats coming from 192 countries. To compete against this pool of skilled employees, you need to continuously update your skills, market knowledge, and expertise. Also, with more stress on Emiratisation with new changes, preference would be given to locals with same qualifications as expats. So, get your competitive edge polished before landing. Ministry urges Emiratis to look at private sector for jobs Attesting documents If you have set your mind on relocating yourself to Dubai, get started with the paperwork. All important documents that will be part of your visa process need to be attested. These include the educational certificates, marriage certificate to sponsor your spouse among other things. Since the procedure involves going to government organisations, keep aside enough time and money for stamping purposes. Avoid scam recruiters During your job hunt, you might receive mails or notifications from bogus recruitment agencies promising you positions and big packages at leading companies. It is common practice for scamsters to get in touch with job seekers after sifting through CVs on job portals. These organisations seek money for processing your job interviews. But practice caution as these companies might not be legit and you might not receive any interview calls. 5 awesome reasons to work in Dubai Never work on visit visa Even if your prospective employer says otherwise, never work while on a visit visa in Dubai. You might have to shell out heavy fines, face deportation or be issued a permanent UAE immigration and labour ban. Some companies resort to these practices to avoid processing expat residency visa but in these cases, the employee is not protected under the UAE law. So, for ensuring your future in the city, avoid violating the law.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T21:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T13:59:49.109+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
