Article continues below \nJones tweeted on Wednesday that he'd love to take the ring against UFC star Anderson Silva prior to the McGregor/Mayweather main event: \nJones's assessment that such an event would be the \"biggest event of all time\" is likely not that far off, as it would involve some of the biggest names in two different sports.

Jones, on the other hand, obviously has had a much more decorated career in the ring, going 65-9 in 74 career fights. \nIf such an event were to take place, it'd be fascinating to see what other UFC-boxing crossover matches could be put together. Maybe Miesha Tate or Ronda Rousey could come out of semi-retirement to try their hand at a new sport. \nObviously, the UFC Invasion event is a long shot to ever happen, but Jones's idea and offer to fight Silva on the undercard could give it a small boost. Unless UFC boss Dana White offers his support to the idea, though, it's still just a pipe dream. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
