Hiring an architect marks a big step for management of the Saratoga Springs, New York thoroughbred track who for more than a decade have been looking to improve corporate hospitality. To do that, NYRA wants to replace its party tent and air-conditioned metal trailers with a nicer building. The New York Racing Association is searching for an architecture firm as Saratoga Race… more Donna Abbott-Vlahos NYRA president and chief executive Chris Kay has spoken extensively over the past two years about the need to create a memorable experience for the nearly 1 million track visitors each summer. The racing association issued a legal notice late last week seeking an architecture firm to design a building that could replace a tent where fundraisers and corporate outings are held. The project also could include replacement of metal trailers with more permanent luxury suites, a lucrative source of income for professional and college football and basketball arenas across the country. \"The issuance of the [request for proposals] is a first, and strictly preliminary, step to inform any decision relating to the construction of a building at Saratoga Race Course that would replace temporary tents and trailers,\" NYRA officials said last week. The racing organization plans to spend $35.9 million in capital improvements at its three race tracks next year, including $6.79 million in upgrades at Saratoga Race Course. Architecture firms have until 3 p.m. on Feb. 23 to contact the NYRA purchasing department to request a big package. Requests can be sent via fax at 718-296-5109. Robin K.
