(Photo: Jay Biggerstaff, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWith February now more than half gone, the college basketball season is in its home stretch. \nAs such, teams have few remaining opportunities to bolster their credentials, whether they’re seeking a higher seed in the NCAA tournament field or simply trying to get in. Here are some matters of importance to note over the next few days. Game of the weekend \nNo. 3 Kansas at No. 4 Baylor, Saturday, 1 p.m. ET, CBS \nFor the moment, the Jayhawks and Bears still project as No. 1 seeds in the NCAA tournament. Kansas strengthened its case with Monday night’s semi-miraculous comeback against West Virginia. Baylor wasn’t as fortunate on the same night, coming up short at Texas Tech. It was the Bears’ third loss in five games, making their hold on the top line of the projected bracket somewhat more tenuous. Bubble Tracker: Which conference will fare best on Selection Sunday? \nA win here for a season split with Kansas would almost certainly keep Baylor on the No. 1 line. Playing at home will help the Bears as well, but the Jayhawks are probably feeling a bit more invincible after their rally. Player to watch \nLonzo Ball, UCLA \nThe Bruins avenged one of their three Pac-12 setbacks by taking down Oregon a week ago. They’ll try to get payback on another conference opponent Saturday as they host crosstown rival Southern California (10 p.m. ET, Pac-12 Networks). \nBut the Trojans have had UCLA’s number of late, winning the last four encounters including the 84-76 decision last month. Ball contributed 15 points and 10 rebounds in that setback, but he was also part of the problem as he committed seven turnovers. That’s part of his risk-reward style, of course, but a higher numerator on his assist ratio would help the Bruins’ cause. Conference to watch \nAtlantic Coast \nAnother eventful Saturday is in the offing around ACC country. The prime-time headliner features No. 9 North Carolina hosting No. 15 Virginia (8:15 p.m. ET, ESPN). The Cavaliers have dropped three of their last four, severely damaging their chances for a top-four seed and double bye in the ACC tournament. But the Tar Heels have first place in the standings to themselves for now and would like to keep it that way. \nEarlier in the day, several of the league’s bubble dwellers will be on the road. Virginia Tech arguably has the toughest assignment of the lot at No. 7 Louisville, although Wake Forest’s trip to red-hot Duke is also a difficult draw. Clemson, which got a much-needed win Tuesday night against Wake, will try to add more heft to its resume at Miami (Fla.). \nHIGHLIGHTS FROM THE WEEK IN COLLEGE HOOPS Facebook Posted!
