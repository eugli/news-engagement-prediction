Credit: PA \nDiana, Princess of Wales, was one of the most photographed women in the world, and every fashion choice she made was closely scrutinised. \nOur exhibition explores the story of a young woman who had to quickly learn the rules of royal and diplomatic dressing, who in the process put the spotlight on the British fashion industry and designers. \nWe see her growing in confidence throughout her life, increasingly taking control of how she was represented, and intelligently communicating through her clothes. â€“ Curator Eleri Lynn Diana was one of the most photographed women in the world.
