Here’s one by TSN’s Gary Lawless, who wonders if Vegas will try to hire the now-former Bruins coach. “Perhaps being part of a new build from the ground up would invigorate Julien. Or maybe he’s only interested in his next job being with a contender. He has the rest of this year at $2.5 million and all of next at $3 million to take his time and make a decision.” ( TSN ) \n— Whether it’s Vegas or some other team, Mike Babcock would be shocked if Julien doesn’t get snapped up. “Good, good, good man. Even better coach. Someone out there is happy today. I mean, you ain’t getting better. When you make these decisions, you better have a guy in mind that’s better than that guy. Not many, I can tell you that.” Babcock and Julien were part of Team Canada’s victorious coaching staffs at the 2014 Olympics and 2016 World Cup. ( Sportsnet ) \n— On Julien’s successor, Bruce Cassidy, whose first go-around as an NHL head coach didn’t end so well. “He was once before a head coach in the NHL, leading the Washington Capitals for a year and half (2002-04) until getting fired after 25 games of his second season as the team spiraled down to last place in the NHL. According to reports at the time , Cassidy also went on a rant in the media about his players that included some personal remarks that later required an apology.” ( Boston Globe ) \n— Back in 2011, there were high hopes for Mark McNeill when the Chicago Blackhawks drafted him 18th overall. “But now here we sit 5½ years later and the 6-foot-2, 212-pound McNeill has played in just one NHL game. For one reason or another players such as Brandon Saad , Andrew Shaw and Phillip Danault — all taken after McNeill in 2011 — and others such as Teuvo Teravainen , Vinnie Hinostroza , Ryan Hartman , Tyler Motte and Nick Schmaltz all were promoted while McNeill has stayed in Rockford.” ( Daily Herald ) \n— On the future of Nassau Coliseum. Could it one day be home to the New York Islanders again? That’s what Newsday investigates as the Isles go in search of a new place to play . “The Islanders and Barclays Center can opt out of their 25-year licensing agreement in January 2018. If the team opts out, it can leave as early as the 2018-19 season. If Barclays opts out, the Islanders must leave after the 2018-19 season.” ( Newsday ) \nEnjoy the games!
