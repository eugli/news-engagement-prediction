(Source: Twitter) Veteran filmmaker Shyan Benegal has hit back against the Pahlaj Nihalani-led Central Board of Film Certification for banning Alankrita Shrivastva’s film ‘Lipstick Under My Burkha’. Benegal said that he is completely against cuts in the film and if the Board finds the content objectionable, it should rather classify the film but should not stop the release. He further said that if the people of India have the power to vote and can choose the government, they should be allowed to choose the films as well.\n“When people of our country have the power to vote, power to change govt, so why should they be told what to see and what not? I am against cuts,I ask for classification of films not censorship,” he said.\nWatch Nihalani avoiding questions:\nhttp://t.co/9mZfCMuIab: #WATCH : CBFC Chairperson Pahlaj Nihalani evades question on ‘Lipstick Under My Burkha’ ce… pic.twitter.com/hs5hPFu1e4\n— muhammad waseem (@mw569256) February 24, 2017", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/mw569256/status/835056518353518593", "http://t.co/hs5hPFu1e4", "http://twitter.com/hashtag/WATCH?src=hash", "http://t.co/9mZfCMuIab:"], "published": "2017-02-25T19:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T09:27:27.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
