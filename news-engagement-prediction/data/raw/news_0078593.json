Dad!\"\n\"When I looked over, here he was, of course, half bottom-up with the snow machine on his leg,\" said Sturge.\n\"I started walking across the road, and then I just noticed what looked like steam to me, and as I got going I [realized] that's smoke.\"\nPerry Sturge dropped off what was left of the snowmobile at the dump in St. Anthony.

I'll tell you the simplest thing could go wrong, right?\"\nIt was flat terrain, according to Sturge, but there was one little bump Ethan just hit the wrong way and if he had been any further away, it could have had a very different outcome.\nSturge said he was pretty scared himself \"after the reality sank in, of what could have happened.\"\nAs for the snowmobile, he dropped that off at the dump in St. Anthony.\nWith files from the Central Morning Show", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T03:46:09.742+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
