She then posted the note to her Facebook page. \nOn February 12 her body was found badly burnt at a popular Newry beach in Anglesey, north Wales by a security guard. (Photo: Supplied by Family) \nHayley told Mirror online: \"It's just the nature of what she's done, the level of what she inflicted on herself to get out of this world. \n\"As a family we are devastated and our lives have been turned upside down. Lisa was a beautiful and caring mum, daughter, sister, aunt, and cousin. \" \nHayley said Lisa, from nearby Llanfaethlu, was going through an extremely difficult period of her life and tried her hardest to overcome her issues but wasn't able to see a way out. \nLisa was having problems with her relationship and was currently unable to see her children.
