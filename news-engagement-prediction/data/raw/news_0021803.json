Pyeongchang Trout Ice Fishing festival also had to start one week later than scheduled, and the festival's duration has been extended to make full use of the cold weather.

Now that it has frozen again we are able to hold this festival,” said Kim Kwang-sun, an official at Pyeongchang. \nHe says organizers are trying to come up with different measures should the ice not freeze in time next year. \n“We are trying to come up with ways we can still fish without frozen ice. Like barge fishing so that people can come and fish comfortably even if the ice has not frozen,” he said. \nBesides the unusual warm temperatures, drought has also posed a problem in recent years. \nThe Inje Icefish Festival, had to be cancelled in 2015 because of an unprecedented drought that dried up the Soyang Lake, which usually freezes with a thickness of up to 30cm. \nThe South Korean government has said it would be spending about US$67 million this year to develop climate-related technologies to curb carbon gas emissions, the major cause of global warming. \nAnalysts say rapid economic growth in South Korea, and recently in China, have posed problems for the environment with the high percentage of carbon gas emissions. - CNA/mn ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T12:17:32.625+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
