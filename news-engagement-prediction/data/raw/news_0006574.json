Ruth Hunter, 33, told how the ordeal left her at “breaking point” and drove her out of her home as she discovered the pervy prowler had broken in and rummaged through her dirty laundry. Facebook 5 Ruth Hunter, pictured with her husband Tony, told how the ordeal left her so distraught she eventually moved house Days after Ruth, from Walsall, caught the knicker thief in the act, police arrested local man, Graham Lees, 36, who was later jailed for four years. She told how she had been growing increasingly paranoid in the weeks leading up the event, after discovering her gate kept being opened during the night. Ruth began to suspect the strange happenings, which began in spring 2011, were down to her former partner. She explained: “This was the first house I had lived alone in with my daughter since I had broken up with my ex. “I wasn’t going to be chased out of my new home easily… Even if someone was out to get me. \n“But I always felt like someone had their eyes on me. I thought I was going mad. \n“I even wondered if my ex was playing tricks, purposefully trying to freak me out for ending our relationship.” Medavia 5 Graham Lees, 36, from Rugby, was later arrested and jailed for four years Things got even weirder when she accidentally left the back door open one day to discover her dirty washing strewn on the floor and some of her underwear missing. She said: “I called the police immediately to report it but without any evidence there was little they could do. “I tried to brush it all under the carpet and thankfully everything died down. “That was until October when I arrived home to discover a wheelie bin had been hurled through my middle room window.” Ruth went to the police again, hoping they would catch the culprit soon. She admitted: “I didn’t know how long I could go on living my life looking over my shoulder. I was becoming a nervous wreck.” But nothing could have prepared her for the events that occurred after a Halloween night out. She recalled: “I was dead to the world until I woke up in the pitch black with the sound of footsteps on the stairs. “My heart was in my mouth as I watched his shadow loom bigger on the landing. Medavia 5 Ruth told how one day she came home to discover her dirty washing strewn on the floor and some of her underwear missing “That’s when it dawned on me. I’d drunkenly left my mobile phone in the bathroom. I couldn’t call for help.” Ruth clamped her eyes shut and prayed he would leave her alone. She said: “As he neared my bedroom I knew the prowler wasn’t here to steal. He was here for me. “I reached under the bed and grabbed the golf club I had stashed there since my troubles had begun. “But I froze when he tip-toed into the bedroom, stopping within touching distance. I could feel his gaze upon me and hear his heavy breathing.” Terrified but determined, Ruth screamed from the bottom of her lungs and he fled. When she was sure he was gone, she grabbed her mobile phone and called her dad Kev, 65, who had thankfully been looking after Mia while she was out. \nWith her dad by her side, Ruth called the police and they came straight round. Medavia 5 Ruth, pictured with husband Tony, told how she called the police once Lees had fled \nShe explained: “During their forensic examinations they discovered he had meticulously taken the time to unscrew the temporary window he had smashed a few weeks previous. \n“He had left the screws in a neat pile on the window sill before climbing through the gap into my house.” \nRuth told how the detective had a suspect in mind and wanted to set up mini-cameras in her home to catch him when he returned. \nShe admitted: “The thought of staying there made me shudder. They told me my house would be surrounded by police, so reluctantly I agreed. \n“But I lasted one night before packing my bags to go live with my dad for a couple of weeks. \n“I knew the detectives needed enough evidence to convict him but I literally couldn’t take anymore. I was at breaking point. There was no way I was going home until he was caught.” Related Stories TOT DEATH VERDICT Mum who killed baby with pair of knickers walks free after judge rules she was mentally disturbed blue and pink ivy?
