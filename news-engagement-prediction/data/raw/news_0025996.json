Ross Poldark had done the dirty on Demelza with Elizabeth, and Demelza came close to betraying her man with Captain McNeil. \nDemelza nearly took their son and was prepared to leave Ross for good, but he managed to coax his lady back into his arms . \nAnd from the looks of these photos the couple are on much better terms when the next season begins. \nThe action drew a crowd on location in Wells, Somerset as actors Aidan Turner and Eleanor Tomlinson strolled through the streets arm in arm. Aidan Turner and Eleanor Tomlinson get to work (Picture: FameFlynet UK) \nCrowds of extras were also present at the shoot, suggested it would be some sort of town or marketplace scene.

The actors were filming on location in Somerset (Picture: FameFlynet UK) \nTomlinson was also seen in a green dress with a grey shawl and a smart hat, suggesting that they’re off somewhere a bit special. \nMeanwhile Aidan chilled out between takes with a cigarette and at one point clutched a hot water bottle. We reckon Ross would disapprove, preferring to tough it out like Chilly Aidan clutched a hot water bottle (Picture: FameFlynet UK) \nPoldark will return later this year.
