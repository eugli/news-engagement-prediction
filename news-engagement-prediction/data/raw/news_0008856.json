Of course it was a difficult decision as I think it was really important the role I have been playing in providing an alternative way forward for rural Britain. But I also believe it was the right thing to do. \n“Nobody voted for a Theresa May Brexit. We are coming out of the single market and that was not on the ballot paper. We have an unelected prime minister taking us down on a path people didn’t vote for. I really fear this lack of democracy taking place.\nParties must work together to stop the UK falling off a Brexit cliff edge | Caroline Lucas Read more \nButler tweeted that it had “been an honour to serve in shadow cabinet doing a job I love. Can’t let down future generations voting against poor excuse of a bill”.\nCorbyn thanked both MPs and described them as “ great assets to the Labour party and to our movement”.\n“MPs have a duty to represent their constituents as well as their party, and I understand the difficulties that MPs for constituencies which voted remain have in relation to the European Union withdrawal bill,” he said.\n“However, it is right that the Labour party respects the outcome of the referendum on leaving the European Union. We have said all along that Labour will not frustrate the triggering of article 50 and to that end we are asking all MPs to vote for the bill at its second reading tonight.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T01:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T20:57:19.819+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
