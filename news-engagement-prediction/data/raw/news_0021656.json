Later, a sum of Rs 8-9 lakh was transferred by Safi from Dubai to Hoda's Himalayan Bank account in Birganj, Nepal. The NIA has the papers relating to the money transfer. \n\nSafi Chacha is already wanted in a 2014 NIA case relating to an FICN consignment of Rs 50 lakh sent to India via Dubai through Ekramul Ansari, a resident of East Champaran. Interestingly, that consignment of Rs 50 lakh had also gone to Ghorasahan in Bihar, where an attempt was made to trigger a blast. \n\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T18:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T09:31:33.282+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
