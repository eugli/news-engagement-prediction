Girls aged six 'believe brilliance is male trait' \n\"Talking had absolutely no effect on boys' relationships at all. What held up their friendships was doing stuff together. \n“Going to a football match, going to the pub for a drink. It was a very striking sex difference.\" \nProfessor Dunbar was speaking at the Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Boston, the Times reported. \nHe said his previous research found that women typically had far stronger, close relationships, while men were more likely to maintain a loose group of friends.
