All of a sudden for the first time, we're getting gang members out. We're getting drug lords out. We're getting really bad dudes out of this country, and at a rate that nobody's ever seen before,” he said. This is notable.

Rex Tilerson (L) with Luis Videgaray, the Mexican foreign minister \nM r Videgaray said he had shared concerns about the human rights of Mexicans living in the US with Mr Tillerson, and advised him of the “legal impossibility” of aspects of the deportation order. \nMr Tillerson, meanwhile, acknowledged the strains in the relationship between the countries. \n“Two strong sovereign countries from time to time will have differences,” he said, noting that as a Texan he had long considered Mexico a “very close neighbour”. \nDespite Mr Trump’s characterisation of his immigration policy as a “military operation” Mr Kelly, a former general, said on Thursday there would be “no use of military forces” to police immigration. John Kelly, the secretary of homeland security \n“We are not going out and doing mass deportations. We have laws that I must follow so we will be looking primarily at criminal offenders first,” he said, “so there will be no mass roundups.” \nH e added that there would be a “physical barrier” constructed along, in a further indication that the wall proposal is non-negotiable.
