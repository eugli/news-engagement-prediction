In a series of tweets Spencer attacked Milo and his supporters, branding them the â€˜Alt Lightâ€™ Milo's done. Put a fork in him. \nâ€” Richard ðŸ¥› Spencer (@RichardBSpencer) February 20, 2017 1/ The Alt Light was always going to collapse. #Milogate just pushed it over the edge. \nâ€” Richard ðŸ¥› Spencer (@RichardBSpencer) February 20, 2017 How long will it be before some boy comes forward and says Milo abused him? \nâ€” Richard ðŸ¥› Spencer (@RichardBSpencer) February 20, 2017 He also appeared a bit, shall we say, jealous of Miloâ€™s standing in Alt Right circles 1/ A tale of two scandals. \nIn a moment of exuberance, I toast \"Hail Trump!\" and some guys give Roman salutes. \nThe Alt Light freaks out. \nâ€” Richard ðŸ¥› Spencer (@RichardBSpencer) February 20, 2017 \n(By â€˜Roman salutesâ€™ he means â€˜Nazi salutesâ€™ and â€˜sieg heilsâ€™) \n2/ Milo defends pedophilia and the Alt Light equivocates. What a fucking joke. â€”Richard ï¥› Spencer (@RichardBSpencer) February 20, 2017 Why are there so many young boys drinking around Milo on his college tour? Ask @bakedalaska , @jaketapper ! \nâ€” Richard ðŸ¥› Spencer (@RichardBSpencer) February 20, 2017 Making himself look even more bitter, Spencer then retweeted other white supremacists saying he should have been leader of the alt-Right \n(WARNING â€“ extremely offensive language) Good thing the alt-lite pushed so hard for a gay racemixing pedo jew to be the face of the brand instead of a clean cut white guy pic.twitter.com/EWWHrvfZr5 \nâ€” Emperor Groyper (@emperor_groyper) February 20, 2017 \nHint â€“ if you want to spot a white supremacist on Twitter, they tend to have â€˜glass of milkâ€™ emojis in their names, and call themselves â€˜lactose tolerantâ€™ in their bios. Spencer then tried to say that Milo was never part of the Alt Right Milo Yiannopoulos always said he was not Alt Right. He was right. \nâ€” Richard ðŸ¥› Spencer (@RichardBSpencer) February 20, 2017 And finished off by saying that Milo was â€˜totally doneâ€™ Just finished a video on Milo, uploading now. The guy is totally done. No sane person will defend him. \nâ€” Richard ðŸ¥› Spencer (@RichardBSpencer) February 21, 2017 Miloâ€™s old manager Tim Treadstone (aka â€˜Baked Alaskaâ€™) also added that he â€˜cannot defend Milo anymoreâ€™ I am Milo's former manager. \nI have defended Milo for standing up for free speech on many occasions. \nToday, I cannot defend Milo anymore. \nâ€” BakedðŸ¥›Alaskaâ„¢ (@bakedalaska) February 20, 2017 Still, people werenâ€™t going to let Spencer and co get off that easily The alt-right infighting is going to be fun to watch *gets popcorn* pic.twitter.com/dV758riVPr", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:18:04.289+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
