Still, unless we heed the message from people who think that we have let them down, a book like this can become the thinking persons’ justification for voting One Nation.”\nOne Nation Senator Pauline Hanson.

Our politics can’t be just a contest of toxic egos or someone’s vanity project.”\nMr Abbott said nearly 40 per cent of Australians “couldn’t bring themselves to vote” for either the Coalition or Labor at the last election and “it’s easy enough to see why.”\n“The next election is winnable”.

Let’s make the next election about government versus gridlock,” he said.\nListing the factors driving voter dissatisfaction, Mr Abbott said Australia had some of the world’s highest energy prices, labour costs, regulatory burdens, house prices close to Hong Kong’s and an education standards worse than Kazakhstan.\nAustralia faces house prices close to Hong Kong’s (pictured) and an education standards worse than Kazakhstan.

Picture: AAP Source: AAP \nHe suggested a new approach to energy policy, drawing on an essay in the book on the subject that “exposes the disastrous muddle successive governments have created.”\n“We are sleepwalking towards what the head of BlueScope said this week was an energy policy ‘catastrophe’,” he said.\n“But it’s not Labor’s even more disastrous 50 per cent renewable target that’s caused the problem — it’s the existing renewable target which the government has no plans to change.”\nHe said under the Government’s plans, the wind generation would double in the next three years, costing consumers $10 billion.\n“We subsidise wind to make coal uneconomic so now we are proposing to subside coal to keep the lights on. Go figure. Wouldn’t’ it be better to abolish subsidies for new renewable generation and let ordinary market forces do the rest?\n“Of course that would trigger the mother-of-all-brawls in the senate, but what better way to let voters know that the Coalition wants your power bill down, while Labor wants it up?\nMr Abbott said the likelihood of defeat in the senate “never stopped the Howard government trying to change the unfair dismissal laws.”\n“Over forty times we tried and failed and each attempt meant that we burnished our small business credentials and Labor damaged theirs,” he said.\nOriginally published as Abbott’s Trump-inspired plan to beat Hanson", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T14:53:39.988+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
