(Reuters) Taking popular heartburn drugs for prolonged periods may lead to serious kidney problems, including renal failure, a new study has warned. The sudden onset of kidney problems often serves as a red flag for doctors to discontinue their patients’ use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which are sold under the brand names Prevacid, Prilosec, Nexium and Protonix, among others. However, a new study evaluating the use of PPIs in 125,000 patients indicates that more than half of patients who develop chronic kidney damage while taking the drugs do not experience acute kidney problems beforehand, meaning patients may not be aware of a decline in kidney function, according to researchers at Washington University and the Veterans Affairs St Louis Health Care System.\nThe onset of acute kidney problems is not a reliable warning sign for clinicians to detect a decline in kidney function among patients taking proton pump inhibitors, said Ziyad Al-Aly, assistant professor at Washington University. “Our results indicate kidney problems can develop silently and gradually over time, eroding kidney function and leading to long-term kidney damage or even renal failure,” said Al-Aly.\nYou may also like to watch:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:27:23.722+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
