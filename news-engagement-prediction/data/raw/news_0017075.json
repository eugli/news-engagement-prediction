But the legislation was expected to encounter resistance in the Senate, where it failed to advance last year amid opposition by a handful of Republican lawmakers after the House passed it unanimously. \nTechnology companies such as Microsoft have lobbied Congress for years to pass the Email Privacy Act, which updates a decades-old law to force authorities to first get a warrant to access emails or other digital communications that are at least 180 days old. \nCurrently, agencies such as the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission only need a subpoena to seek such data from a service provider. \n(Reporting by Dustin Volz; Editing by Tom Brown) Next In Technology News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T06:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:36:29.751+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
