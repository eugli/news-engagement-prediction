Slot to 247Sports Links \nBased on talent alone, there's little question that Oklahoma running back Joe Mixon would have earned an invitation to the NFL Combine. But Mixon has not been invited to the NFL Combine, with the likely reason being his conviction for assaulting a woman in 2014. Baylor wide receiver Ish Zamora, who was seen on video beating his girlfriend's dog, was also not invited. \nNFL teams received final combine invite list. Among those not invited: Oklahoma RB Joe Mixon and Baylor WR Ishmael Zamora , per sources. — Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) February 3, 2017 \nBeginning in 2016 , the NFL introduced a rule banning draft prospects from the combine if \"background check shows misdemeanor or felony convictions involving violence or use of a weapon, domestic violence, sexual offense and/or sexual assault.\" \nAs the news broke, some critics worried about the unintended consequences of the rule that led to Mixon's exclusion. \nInteresting..By product of this means these players won't have to deal w questions from media there abt those issues & more attention on it. https://t.co/Q5Ojs1zH4i — Bruce Feldman (@BruceFeldmanCFB) February 3, 2017 \nLumping Zamora in with Mixon after a year that featured Tyreek Hill on the front page of https://t.co/WBHa7BtnQP isn't a great message. — David Ubben (@davidubben) February 3, 2017 \nMixon is talented enough to be one of the first running backs off the board in the 2017 NFL Draft, but it remains to be seen if or how far he'll fall as teams wrestle with the question of how much the negative PR that will come with him affects his value.
