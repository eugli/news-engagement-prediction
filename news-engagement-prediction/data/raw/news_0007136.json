Thompson broke his opponent early in the third to go ahead 3-2 but then lost concentration to hit four unforced errors and allow Vesely to level at 4-4. \nBut the Australian hit straight back, breaking again before serving out the match with an ace to the delight of his mentor, captain Lleyton Hewitt. \nThe patriotic Thompson, who has a coat-of-arms tattoo on his arm, said it was the biggest win of his career. \n\"The summer has been pretty good, but playing for your country is amazing and getting us off to a 1-0 lead is even better,\" he said. Kyrgios shows good signs after Open disappointment External Link: Davis Cup tweet \nAustralia's top-ranked player, Kyrgios, had a straightforward win over world number 157 Jan Satral in the afternoon's rubber. \nKyrgios, who disappointed with a second-round exit at last month's Australian Open , made quick work of Satral, winning 6-2, 6-3, 6-2 in one hour and 37 minutes. \nThe controversial Canberran broke in the second game of the match and saved three break points on his own serve the following game to establish a 3-0 lead. \nKyrgios broke again in the sixth game and took a one-set lead with another break of Satral's serve two games later. \nThe second set followed a similar pattern, with the Australian breaking early then holding firm to take the set 6-3, and two early breaks in the third set sent the 21-year-old on the way to victory. \nAustralia will be able to clinch the World Group tie with a win in Saturday's doubles. \nAAP/ABC", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T12:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T07:56:39.838+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
