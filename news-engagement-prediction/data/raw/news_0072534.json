But today’s figures put the Coalition seriously underwater: ten points behind Labor. \nTwo factors won’t have helped: One Nation and Tony Abbott. \nThe ousted PM promised “no sniping” when he lost the leadership. Last week he set off a hand grenade instead. \nHis five point plan got plenty of attention, reinvigorated tensions over the direction of the Liberal party and led to public comments by former colleagues showing Mr Abbott now as popular as a Polly Waffle in a swimming pool. \nThe Abbott Agenda - no new debt, lower immigration, lower taxes etc - could be easily dismissed as a list of things he failed to achieve as leader. \nBut it does tally with grievances from voters now drifting towards One Nation - particularly when it comes to immigration. Pauline Hanson’s party now has ten percent of the primary vote – double that of late last year. \nTheir next electoral test is the WA state election. A strong result there will further embolden those on Mr Turnbull’s right. \nIn the preferred Prime Minister horse race Turnbull continues to enjoy a lead over Bill Shorten. But personal popularity can be overrated in a country that doesn’t directly elect its leader. \nA couple of weeks ago Malcolm Turnbull literally had his own side cheering as he launched a fusillade against Bill Shorten in Parliament. It had the appearance of an ad-lib attack that was carefully prepared. \nAnd it worked, it rallied the troops. \nExpect a similar tactic when Parliament resumes today. \nAs for Tony Abbott’s leadership ambitions, the words of Confucius come to mind: \"Before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T02:39:58.843+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
