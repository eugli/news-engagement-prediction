She took to Snapchat to tell her followers all about the procedure, using the voice-altering rabbit filter for good measure. \"So I just left Dr. Ourian's office and we worked on stretch marks today, and I feel so excited that I finally did it,\" the mom of two said on Sunday. \"I've been so scared to do it thinking it'd hurt so badly, and it didn't hurt that badly. So I'm so grateful, and I'm so excited. I love you, Dr. Ourian.\" A post shared by Kim Kardashian Snapchats (@kimksnapchats) on Feb 19, 2017 at 10:05am PST WATCH: Kim Kardashian Unveils More Sexy Bikini Pics from Her Trip to Costa Rica Once home, Kim continued to play around on Snapchat with her 3-year-old daughter, North West, who was also enthralled with the app's bunny ears. \"You're so cute,\" the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star told Norie as the toddler made animal noises into the camera.
