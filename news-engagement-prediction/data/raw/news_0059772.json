Her capacity to empathise expanded exponentially. \n“What you learn is how to deal with people when they’re very angry or at the saddest moments in their lives. I think that sets you up as a young female,” Goddard tells foxfooty.com.au . \nThese skills were only enhanced when Goddard travelled to Thailand in the wake of the devastating 2004 tsunami then Bali in the wake of the 2005 bombings, as part of the Australian Federal Police’s victim identification mission. \n“Certainly when I landed in Thailand and there were bodies piled up on the side of the road, that changes the way the way you think about the world,” Goddard says. \n“It was very confronting. I worked at the outdoor morgue daily.” \nMost confronting for Goddard was the criminal: Mother Nature. \n“With the bombing and other offences, there was a crime attached to it,” Goddard says. \n“There was always someone responsible. But not in this case.” \nLive stream EVERY game of the 2017 NAB AFL Women’s competition on FOX SPORTS. Get your free 2-week FOXTEL PLAY trial and start watching in minutes.

And given the speed at which she has had to create a team from scratch, this skill cannot be understated. \n“Being in the police force has allowed me to very quickly identify the character of a person. I think that I’ve got a really good ability to see people (for who they are) straight away,” she says. \nHelping Goddard identify character traits has been NT football figure Colleen Gwynne, who is also a member of the police force and one of Goddard’s assistant coaches. \nGwynne headed the team that prosecuted English backpacker Peter Falconio’s murderer, Bradley John Murdoch. \nWhen you learn of the work these women perform on a daily basis — Goddard is now sergeant of the Joint Anti Child Exploitation team run by South Australian and Federal Police — it’s easy to see how Adelaide has defied pre-season expectations. \nGoddard has a breadth of life experiences which have made her transition to coaching virtually seamless. \n“I think it’s probably something about me that other people — not saying they don’t have it — but if you look at the history of a coach in the AFL they play football, go into the system and that’s what they bring,” Goddard says. \n“Whereas in my life I’ve had this element of diversity when you’re leading teams in really stressful circumstances. And then I coach football after that.” \nGoddard’s best judgment call to date has arguably been the appointment of dual Australian Olympic basketballer Erin Phillips to the position of co-captain. She says it was an easy decision. \n“I knew Erin was going to be a quality player. She’s a formidable athlete in her own right,” Goddard says. \n“I spoke to Erin before she left America, quite early on in the piece and I spoke to her about what she needed to do with the group in terms of leadership and her elite approach to the game. \n“I needed her to help me bring this development group of players who had never been in an elite environment up to speed. She arrived at the club and made a massive impression.” Erin Phillips and Bec Goddard have formed a strong friendship.

Phillips’ father Greg played in eight premiership for Port Adelaide in the ‘80s and ‘90s. \n“She’s a true athlete. She loves football and is probably a bit different to some of the other cross-code athletes in that she grew up with it,” Goddard says of Phillips. \n“Even though she couldn’t play it, she always had an idea about footy and that footy IQ. She understands structure and game plan very well, with set plays and so forth.” \nNEW FLAG FAVOURITES \nThree rounds into the season, Adelaide and Brisbane are the only undefeated teams. Preseason favourites Fremantle, conversely, have only managed one draw. \nSo does Goddard subscribe to the theory she’s usurping Michelle Cowan as the AFLW’s biggest coaching asset? \n“I haven’t really thought about it like that,” she laughs. \n“We want to promote the game together. I think going forward as a group of female coaches it’s good to have those positive relationships and be able to talk openly about footy and where we’re going.” \nAdelaide is certainly going somewhere special under Goddard. \nThe players have embraced her, not just as a coach, but as a friend. You can see it in their faces when they belt out the team song and in their embraces when they run up to Goddard at the end of each match. \nThis is humankind at its best — and Goddard has her fingerprints all over it. \n“I think all of the areas I’ve worked in policing, football has always been a nice contrast and that’s probably the great thing for me, that I’ve always had football in some kind of capacity, whether it be as a volunteer, player or an umpire,” Goddard says. \n“We’re so happy after each win because each girl is playing a team role. \n“They’re not widely known in the state football context and they’ve been a real surprise packet to everyone else, but not to us.” View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
