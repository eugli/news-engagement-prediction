On a business-as-usual basis, there is no way the Railways can, on its own, finance the Rs 1 lakh crore safety fund that finance minister Arun Jaitley said would be created over a period of five years. To help fund this, for instance, the Railways will have to slash the R33,000 crore (in FY15) of passenger subsidies it gives right now—that’s 67% of total earnings from this segment. To that extent, Jaitley has done well to say future fares will be decided after taking into account what other modes of transport cost—in the case of the sleeper class, for instance, while buses charge 92 paise per km, the Railways charges a mere 57 paise; in the second-class category, buses cost 75 paise per km versus 38 paise in the Railways.\nYou May Also Want To Watch:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T12:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T08:12:58.623+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
