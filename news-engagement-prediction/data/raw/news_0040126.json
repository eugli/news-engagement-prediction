Article continues below \nSometimes it gets personal, too. Just last week, Neville posted a picture on Instagram of himself getting a haircut, which Carragher commented on saying: \"See if she can take a bit off your nose.\" \nOuch. All's fair in love and war where the Sky Sports duo are concerned, but it's all in jest.

I found I could say things he didn't like and he could say things I didn't like and then you'd forget about it and move on. That's key. \n\"Sometimes with pundits, you can see they are not willing to have an argument, they are frightened of upsetting each other.\" \nAnd long may it continue. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
