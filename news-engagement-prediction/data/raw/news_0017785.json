He was last seen on these isles last season, scoring eight goals in his second and final season for Rotherham United. \nWell now the former Blackburn Rovers striker has traded the Championship for the Cypriot First Division and is tearing it up for Omonia Nicosia. \nAfter showing some brief glimpses of promise during his early years at Ewood Park, Derbyshire's career meandered from club to club, with the England U21 international taking in spells with Plymouth Argyle, Wrexham, Olympiacos, Nottingham Forest, Birmingham City, Oldham Athletic, Blackpool and Rotherham before he finally made his way to Cyprus. \nAnd the 30-year-old forward has taken to the Cypriot top flight like a duck to water, firing in 18 goals in just 20 games to become the top scoring Englishman in Europe, this season. \nDerbyshire's total tally in all competitions is 20 goals, which is the same amount as he managed during two seasons at Rotherham. In fact, the current campaign is the former Blackburn man's most prolific ever, doubling his previous career best tally for a single season.

He's in much better form than Daniel Sturridge and Jamie Vardy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T04:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:12:35.405+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
