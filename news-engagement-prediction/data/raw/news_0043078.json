He had toured the world as a Christian minister for more than two decades in retirement. Oreal James Perras as 'The Russian Bear,' Ivan Koloff, in an udated photo. AP \nIn an almost-30-year career beginning in the 1960s, Koloff — dressed in a singlet bearing the hammer-and-sickle emblem of the former U.S.S.R., his bald head gleaming — strode into the ring carrying a Soviet flag, to the strains of the Soviet national anthem. \nHe was usually pitted against \"babyface\" good guys cast as upholding the honor of the United States, often forcing them to submit with his signature finishing move — a viselike bear hug. \nThe highlight of his long career was pinning the legendary Bruno Sammartino in 1971 to win the World Wide Wrestling Federation world championship at Madison Square Garden in New York. \nIn real life, Koloff — born Oreal James Perras in 1942 in Montreal or in Glasgow, Scotland, depending on who's doing the telling — was a gentle man who retired in the early 1990s, was \"born again\" and became an ordained minister, longtime WWE editor Brian Solomon wrote in his 2006 history of the circuit, \"WWE Legends.\" \n\"We are saddened that he is no longer here with us but we rejoice in knowing where he is: with his Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ,\" said Rachel Marley, Koloff's daughter. \"He has received his healing.\" \nChris Sutton told WITN that Koloff was a familiar figure on the sidewalks and in the restaurants of Winterville, where he was beloved. \n\"We didn't lose Ivan to death,\" Sutton said. \"We gained a great big Russian bear angel that now is able to watch over us all.\" BEFORE THERE WAS IRON SHEIK THERE WAS IVAN KOLOFF.

One of his ministries, in fact, was named \"Bearing Witness.\" \nAs for wrestling, Koloff wrote in his 2007 book, \"Is That Wrestling Fake? The Bear Facts,\" it's both 100 percent entertainment and 100 percent real. The storylines and outcomes are scripted — but the falls and injuries are very real.
