(POOL/REUTERS) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated:   7:59 AM \nCharleston church shooter Dylann Roof stopped by another black church the night of his Bible study massacre in 2015, court papers show. \nNewly unsealed documents in Roof’s federal case cite GPS data that was not presented in his trial. The records show that after Roof gunned down nine parishioners at the Emanuel AME Church on June 17, he stopped at another house of worship — the Branch AME Church — and shut off his GPS device for several minutes. Like Emanuel, the Branch church was holding its weekly Bible study that night. \nThere is no indication that Roof entered the church, and it’s unclear if anyone was still there when he arrived. \nProsecutors argue that this shows Roof was contemplating another attack, but defense attorneys have said there is no evidence of this. \nConvicted church shooter Dylann Roof wants new federal trial \nIn his FBI interview after his arrest, Roof told police he was too tired after his Emanuel massacre to keep shooting. One survivor of the shooting said Roof put his gun to his head and pulled the trigger — but there were no bullets. He then fled the church, and was caught in another town the next morning.

He is now awaiting another trial, this time in state court, for his nine murders. \nWith News Wire Services", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:13:02.120+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
