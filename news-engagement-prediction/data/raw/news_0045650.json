Stokes, who may not be available for the end of the tournament due international commitments, was bought for 14.5 crore in the first round of the auction. The highest fee in IPL history was Yuvraj Singh, who was bought for 16 crore (£1.9m) by Delhi Daredevils in 2015. Ben Stokes and Tymal Mills attract millions at IPL auction – as it happened Read more \nPune owner Sanjiv Goenka told reporters Stokes would bring something new to the team for the 10th edition of the tournament. “He’s a complete player and he completes our squad. We’ve been lacking this one genre of player,” he said. “We knew he was going to be there for the first 14 games … We pretty much knew we were not going to get him for below this price.” \nEngland T20 specialist Tymal Mills later earned a lucrative deal of his own as he was snapped up by the Royal Challengers Bangalore for £1.4m. The left-arm quick – who does not play any longer forms of the game due to back problems and is available for the entire tournament – will team up with India captain Virat Kohli in Bangalore. \nKolkata Knight Riders held off Hyderabad to snap up all-rounder Chris Woakes in a deal worth £506,583. And elsewhere in the first round, England T20 skipper Eoin Morgan went to Kings XI Punjab for £240,271 while international team-mates Jason Roy, Alex Hales and Chris Jordan all went unsold.
