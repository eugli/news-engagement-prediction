Cuz you a star not the kind that snort them white lines but the kind that light the nighttime. #goal.” \nA photo posted by Matt Jordan (@mattjordanbrand) on Jan 18, 2017 at 3:16pm PST \nWhen asked point blank if he was referring to the former beauty queen as the one who “snort them white lines,” he immediately denied it, according to RadarOnline . \n“God no! No emphatically no. Just rap lyrics.” \n\nAt least he’s honest about that. Kenya has accused the 29-year-old of lying about his temper and erratic behavior , including damaging her property and speaking distastefully about her fertility issues . \nMatt has also accused the reality star of dating married men for money and orchestrating plot lines on the show to keep herself relevant. \n\nThe chiseled ex shouldn’t be one to talk, however. He recently punched Kenya’s driver and earned two arrest warrants because of it. \nThe driver spoke out about the incident, saying, “I was protecting Kenya Moore. The doors were locked, however, my window was down. Security and I were waiting on Peter to get Ms. Moore from the car. Matt drove up, spotted her, came to the car and stuck his head in the window.” \nCredit: Bravo \nHe went on, “They’re both screaming and cussing each other when he tried to open the door by sticking his hand in to open the door from the inside, I rolled up the window and he pulled his head out and punched me.” \n\nDo you think Kenya is really the crazy one, or is Matt the one off of his rocker? Sound off below. \n\nThe Real Housewives of Atlanta Season 9 airs Sundays at 8 p.m. ET on Bravo. \nCheck out more of Wetpaint ’s coverage of Real Housewives of Atlanta Season 9 below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T22:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T18:55:48.368+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
