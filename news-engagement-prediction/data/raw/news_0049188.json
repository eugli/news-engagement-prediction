He has a chance to jump into title contention with a big win on Saturday night, but he’ll face a tough challenge in Browne, who was once considered one of the most dangerous fighters on the roster. \nThe co-main event features former champion Johny Hendricks and former welterweight Hector Lombard as both fighters try to find their footing in the middleweight division while former women’s strawweight titleholder Carla Esparza highlights prelims against Randa Markos. \nThe action gets underway at 6:30PM/3:30PM ETPT on UFC Fight Pass before moving over to FS1 for the prelims at 7PM/4PM ETPT. The main card, also live and free on FS1, start at 9PM/6PM ETPT. Keep it here for blow-by-blow coverage of the event and stick around afterwards for all your UFC Halifax news, results and analysis.
