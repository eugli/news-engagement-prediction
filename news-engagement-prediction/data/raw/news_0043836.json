Lush, green shoots from aspens, the predominant tree species in the area, have burst from the burned soil and are a metre high in some areas. The root systems of aspens can survive the flames and heat from wildfires. \nDan Thompson, a research scientist with the Canadian Forest Service, said a warm, wet summer created ideal conditions for regrowth. \nWithin about 10 years, aspens will be tall enough to appear like a forest again and will grow to pre-fire levels in about 30 years. \nOther tree species such as spruce will take much longer to recover. \nDramatic pictures last May of walls of flames consuming stands of trees might leave the impression that nothing could withstand such a destructive fire. \nBut wildfires have been part of the life cycle of the western boreal forest for thousands of years, Thompson said. \n“The ecosystem there is really adaptive to fire,” he said. “Even though we had really bad human consequences, the natural consequences of this fire are just a tiny, tiny fraction of what the human consequences were.” \nWatch below: During an update on the Fort McMurray wildfire in May 2016, Bernie Schmitte, forestry manager in Fort McMurray, explained how a Boreal forest is a fire-dependant ecosystem that adapts itself to being easily ignitable. \nThe wildfire killed or displaced an unknown number of animals and its aftermath poses different problems for different species. \nDeer, bears, wolves and caribou would have tried to move out of the flames’ path. Smaller critters such as mice and voles would have sought shelter in burrows deep in the ground. \nThe challenge for animals will be to find enough food and cover for them to survive. Van Wilgenburg said some animals might have been able to find refuge in areas within the fire zone that didn’t burn. \nREAD MORE: ‘Hope tree’ a gift to Fort McMurray from a 6- year-old Edmonton girl \nThe destruction of older trees that provide lichen for caribou or homes for martens and fishers could mean their populations won’t recover until the end of the century. \nDespite the damage, within a dozen years most people will hardly notice signs of the extensive wildfire, Van Wilgenburg said. \nDead trees that look like burnt matchsticks will fall and new trees will take their place. \n“It is remarkable how quickly you can no longer easily tell that a forest fire was through an area.” \nWatch below: A picture of a small sapling planted in the burned forest near Fort McMurray went viral following last May’s wildfire. It was planted by Darren Anderson, a firefighter from Strathcona County. His six-year-old daughter gave him the tree as a gift for the residents of Fort McMurray.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:09:47.537+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
