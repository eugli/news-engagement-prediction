Share Get daily   Thank you for subscribing!   \nRoses are red, violets are blue - that novelty mug is obscene take it off the shelves immediately! \nAh, Valentines Day: a day to celebrate love, romance, passion and the purchasing of tacky never-to-used-again items in a last ditch attempt to cover up the fact you'd forgotten about it. \nOne such potential loved-up purchase has caused much hilarity on social media today after a Cheshire mum posted pictures of it on Twitter. Read More \nKitty O'Rourke was shopping in Sainsbury's on Thursday when she spotted some rather rude looking novelty mugs. \nThe two matching cups are meant to depict a couple of bears cuddling. \nWhat could be more innocent you might ask? \nWell, as Kitty thoughtfully pointed out to the supermarket on their Facebook page the two mugs: \"don't look quite like they are hugging\". \nInstead, as Kitty puts it they look \"rather excited to see each other.\" \nShe goes on to write that she \"had to swerve awkward questions from a two-year-old. Maybe not the best design!\" \nNow, we're pretty broad minded, but when this is happening on mugs in Sainsbury's a line perhaps has to be drawn. \nOur sister paper the Mirror Online tracked down Kitty to ask her about her findings and this is what she told them: \"We were just browsing the Valentine's bit when I noticed them with my husband and burst out laughing at how poorly (or brilliantly) designed they were. \n\"My son even asked why the bears have willies and I didn't know how to answer. I told him it was a tail. \n\"We found the whole thing hilarious and didn't purchase them but after all the attention the photo got I feel like perhaps we should!!\" Read More \nKitty added that she didn't purchase the mugs. But they got, as she mentioned, a fair bit of interest on the Sainsbury's Facebook page. \nSupermarket spokesman Andy said: \"What ever do you mean Kitty? \n\"Of course they are excited to see each other, hence why they are #hugging.\" \nMaybe it's just our dirty minds eh?
