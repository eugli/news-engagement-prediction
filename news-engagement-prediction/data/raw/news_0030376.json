But the unexpected has a way of making the eye linger—exactly the point—which is reason enough to retool your Valentine’s Day beauty game with a vibrant coral lip. The Spring runways served up ample inspiration, with fluoro-bright mouths at Jason Wu and a traffic-cone take on orange-red at Versus Versace, sounding out a bold-is-better message loud and clear.
