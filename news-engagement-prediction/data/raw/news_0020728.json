Jesus Christ, no chance. I wouldn't sell them a virus.'\nMourinho insisted on Friday that De Gea is happy at Old Trafford. But the United boss, who spent three years in charge at the Bernabeu under Florez, claimed their friendship is strong enough that any negotiations between the two clubs over potential transfer deals this summer will be honest and above board.\n'I am not going to speak about hypothetical things,' he said. 'The only thing that is real is that he is my player. I am happy with him, I know that he is happy with me, and there is absolutely nothing else.'\nAsked if the De Gea reports are the start of a typical Madrid campaign to unsettle the player, Mourinho said: 'With Mr Perez and his right arm Jose Angel Sanchez, they are some of the people in football that I can say I did not work for them and then it is over.\nCristiano Ronaldo's transfer to Madrid caused frictions between the two clubs back in 2009\nMourinho has revealed he expects Zlatan Ibrahimovic to remain at United for the next season\n'I can say that we are friends forever, big friends. I like them a lot. Friends speak. Friends are open, friends are honest.\n'So if at the end of the season I want one of their players or they want one of our players we will not do it through the press that we are going to exchange messages.\n'We will be very direct. So they are one of the clubs that I am not worried about at all.'\nMourinho, who reassured United fans that leading scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic will still be at the club next season, confirmed that he has already drawn up a hit-list of transfer targets for United chief Ed Woodward and the Glazer family.\n'I know the players I want,' he said. 'I am not going to tell Mr Woodward and the Mr Glazers 'bring me (Lionel) Messi'. I know exactly what I want and I know what I want is possible.'", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/DailyMailManUnited"], "published": "2017-02-11T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:34:46.954+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
