She laughs, sighs and sticks her nose deep in her teacup. “I think there are default ways of thinking about what power looks like, that are hardwired, that means you just have to work harder to appoint someone who doesn’t look like the typical [person for that job].” She pauses. “It’s not just the women who have to talk about it, as it’s a problem for everybody. It means the culture we live in gives us very specific gender roles and no one’s winning.” \nShe burrows in her rucksack to get out the book she’s reading at the moment, The Descent of Man by Grayson Perry, which has lots to say on this very subject. “As theatre-makers it’s important that we are really conscious of the perspective we have, isn’t it? The male gaze is a very specific way of looking at the world and as a woman you go, ‘It’s normal for me that the dead woman’s body in the detective story is totally fetishised and I don’t question it, that’s just how these stories work’. And then you have a moment of going, ‘Hang on. Why should that be?’” \nWhat does it mean to her to run a building? “It’s that brilliant thing of being able to give artists you believe in a space to make work. That’s the thing I’m most enjoying at the moment,” she says enthusiastically. She’s unswervingly clear about the appeal of the Gate. “I fell in love with that space when I first came back to London after doing my degree and I went to see these bonkers shows in there. Bonkers is such a s**t word, please don’t quote that! Adventurous shows! Shows that were unlike anything I saw anywhere else and were also unlike each other. Each time I came into that space I didn’t recognise it to be the same theatre and I loved that. [The Gate is] A magic kaleidoscope at the top of that little dusty staircase behind a bus stop!” It’s a beautiful, not to mention accurate, description. Emma Rice on the Wonder Season, folk tales and challenges at the Globe \nMcDougall’s association with the Gate stretches back; it was there that she gained her first creative footing in theatre, as a script reader, and she also previously served as the venue’s associate director (when she spent several Sundays repainting the foyer, she notes). Her programming, she says, will continue in the Gate’s trailblazing mode. “I am drawn to plays that in some way respond to a question about ‘Why do this now?’” She pauses to reflect. “The international focus of that theatre is one of the things I love about it and I want to push that further. I want it to feel like a place that is truly diverse, in terms of voices from all different parts of the world and backgrounds, crossing paths and making work together. A fertile place where you’re not just talking to yourself or people like you, you’re always negotiating and celebrating different perspectives.” \nErica Whyman, for one, is convinced that her old stamping ground has picked well. “Ellen is a thrilling choice. She is bold, principled and her fellow theatre-makers respect how she works. The Gate is a precious space that needs love, vision and integrity — all of which Ellen has in spades.” \nMcDougall grew up in north London, with a mother who was a midwife and a father who worked in finance. She became interested in theatre through acting at school and started directing at university in Edinburgh.
