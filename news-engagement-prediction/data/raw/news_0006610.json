They said you better come down to the weir with us, and I said what for – they said ‘we think your son is in the river’, I just couldn’t think,” he told UTV.\n“They took me down in the car and I stood on the old bridge in the freezing cold and it was just so unreal.”\nPlay video At the weekend his family, friends and volunteers came to remember him five years on.\nSome of those who searched for Joby stood side-by-side with his loved ones.\nHis loved ones had to wait an agonising 31 days before his body was recovered.\nIt was the Community Rescue Service - using specialist equipment - that found him.\nSince then it has patrolled the waters 500 times.\nIt was only after Joby's death that the Community Rescue Service set up weekend patrols in Belfast.\nSince then the volunteers have saved hundreds of lives.\nPaul Stitt, a volunteer with Community Rescue Service, told UTV: “You find [people] on the bridges, you find them sitting about, we would go over and talk to them and over that period of time, anybody we’ve come into contact with, we’ve actually saved. Nobody has gone into the water while we’ve been here and not come back out alive.\n“There’s always somebody else that needs saved or helped and that’s why I come down here every week.”\nIt’s that legacy which Joby's family clings to, as his dad explains: “It makes you feel better that something’s good has been done out of the tragedy that happened to Joby and hopefully, that sort of tragedy will never happen again on the River Lagan.”\n rescue Northern Ireland", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:24:11.728+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
