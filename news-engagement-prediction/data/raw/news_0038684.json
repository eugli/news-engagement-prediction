I saw many films in '09, but none with the intensity and raw passion of Precious. Monique showed an incredible range, and Gabourey Sidibe was truly genius. I went into this film with so-so expectations, and came away profoundly affected. I would recommend it to everybody, and hope everyone walks away realizing just how \"precious\" life is. Quite possibly the most powerful film of 2009. by HotBaritoneMess Each patron of this movie should be warned: this film is excruciating. Not because it was bad- far from it. The movie is so raw that the emotion is palpable, leaving the audience somber for the rest of the night.Mo'Nique's characterization of Mary is truly monstrous- I had to keep reminding myself that, indeed, that is Mo'Nique- she is virtually unrecognizable not only through appearance but through her character. Without a stitch of make-up, she transforms into the full terrifying embodiment of hyper-abusive Mary Jones, yet with a twist- she is possibly the most sympathetic character in the film, delivering an absolutely heart-breaking monologue at the end of the film, sending the audience into a state of sheer confusion: is Mary Jones truly a villain, or is she a victim? She is truly the best character in the entire movie, and I would argue the best character of the year. She rightly deserves all awards and recognition for this role.Fans will even forgive Mariah Carey for \"Glitter\"- her performance is succinct yet incredibly effective. Equally impressive is newcomer Gabourney Sidibe as the title character; although she will have a difficult time at this year's Oscars, audiences will most certainly want to see more of her in upcoming films.On the whole, \"Precious\" is rough, yet it cannot be forgotten as the most powerful film of 2009. Frightening by VSANK This movie is hard to watch. But, if you can get past the first 30 minutes, you'll bear witness to the most villainous character since \"Nurse Ratched\" in 'Cuckoos Nest. Mo'nique's character is monstrous. She makes Hannibal Lecter look like a girl scout. For a short time, I felt personal hatred for Mo'nique. I couldn't separate the character from the actor. Her performance was THAT good. Do yourself a favor, get the movie and scare the hell out of your unruly children.
