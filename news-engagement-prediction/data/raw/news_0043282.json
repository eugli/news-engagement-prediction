And I wanted to know him better and I wanted to know this country better,” she said. \nMaddox, who accompanied his mother on the trip, was seen visiting the Angkor temple complex on Friday. \nIn a tribute to those who survived the brutal regime, Jolie has pushed to ensure the film would be both made by Cambodians and accessible to them. \nAlmost the entire film is in the Khmer language while the cast members and much of the crew were local hires, including the two child protagonists. \nThe film is also co-produced by Rithy Panh, Cambodia’s most acclaimed filmmaker. \nHe lost almost all his immediate family during the Khmer Rouge years but went on to produce searing documentaries that helped break the silence surrounding the genocide. \nLoung Ung, who Jolie described as a “family friend”, said that while the film centred on her family’s experience, her story would be familiar to all Cambodians. \nThe premiere will be followed by screenings across Cambodia, some seven months before the film is released to a global audience on Netflix. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T03:57:18.585+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
