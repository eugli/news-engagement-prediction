King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 3 minutes ago 1 \nTony Iommi pointed out that Black Sabbath's final show in Birmingham only marked the end of the band's large-scale touring, with the doors still being wide open for occasional one-off concerts and studio work. \nHe tells Planet Rock : \"I'm going to miss playing on stage because that has been my whole life. I like it and I'm sure it's not going to end like that; I'm sure we might do a one-off show somewhere. \n\"It's just the touring for me - it's time to stop roaming the world and be at home for a bit... I'm still going to write and put stuff out.\" \nAsked whether Sabbath's recording days are truly over, Tony replied: \"No, I don't think we've ruled anything out apart from me not wanting to tour any more on that scale, but who knows, we may do something. \n\"We haven't spoken about it. That's another thing - we haven't talked about anything, really, that's to do with what's going to happen afterwards. But I'm sure something can happen somewhere.\" \nThe guitarist concluded on an optimistic note: \"It's nice just to take some time off and really think about it.

It's all there and needs some thought. I don't want to rush into anything. \n\"Thing is, when you're touring, you've got to go out for six, eight, twelve months or whatever and you've got a schedule that you have to do. Now... if I want to do some TV for a month, I can do that...\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T19:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T14:14:20.106+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
