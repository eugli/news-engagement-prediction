Cue viral debate about whether Shaw had demeaned this non-league club in their proudest hour. \nThere was plenty for Sutton’s directors to scowl at after a generally uplifting night at Gander Green Lane. A pitch invasion, flares at both ends, a couple of fights on the 3G surface and plastic bottles thrown at the Arsenal dug-out and their fans. Much of this could be marked down as manic excitement. All the perpetrators looked like over-stimulated teens. There was no need to summon a whole club to the dock or disregard the efforts of the players in giving Arsenal a proper game. Shaw, though, is less easily forgiven for making himself the story, not through exuberance but in the interests of a clownish prank. \nPaul Doswell, the Sutton manager, was not dismissing the claim that Shaw’s stunt was for a bet. \n“I would assume so,” he said. “I think Wayne has become this global superstar on the back of being 23 stone. He’s made that a chance to make some more media coverage off the back of it. The reality is I don’t know, but it wouldn’t surprise me. I don’t think it shows us in the best light.” Watch | Sutton United v Arsenal - key match stats 01:02 \nS utton did show themselves in the “best light”, with their enterprise on the pitch and their stage management off it . It is a measure of these times, perhaps, that no live event can unfold these days without sideshows, many of them contrived. Certainly viewers at home can be forgiven for their astonishment when Shaw, who played no part in the game, demolished his pie in a way that was obviously designed to catch the camera’s eye. \nSix days ago Arsenal took on the nobility in Munich. This time they motored south to face the peasantry, if Sutton will forgive that phrase. As their former Gunner, Craig Eastmond, said, “this is the real world, the real stuff” - a world only a Premier League snob could fail to like. \nThe trick for the Lilliputians on these occasions is to take it seriously without taking it TOO seriously, and Sutton managed that beautifully , until Shaw decided it would be alright to portray non-league football as an excuse to muck about. Some Sutton United supporters invaded the pitch on the whistle Credit: REX FEATURES \nS andwiched in the fifth-tier ‘Vanarama’ between Solihull Moors and Torquay United, Sutton are not guaranteed of staying in that echelon. The relegation zone is only six points below them. But they are one of those clubs deeply embedded in that realm of English football where crazy money and news ubiquity never feature, much less interfere. \nThe rolling hubbub around the ground was not one of starstruck folk far from the Premier League cosmos. Sutton straightened their blazer and readied their ground to burst at the seams. \nDave Fairbrother, the ground safety officer, found his usual duties radically expanded. For the Leeds game, four police horses showed up, but this one brought the cavalry. Fairbrother imported “an emergency generator, a electrician on standby and a floodlighting specialist,” telling match day programme readers: “Oh and this time I’ve come prepared [for police horse dung]. I have a bucket and shovel and some roses eagerly anticipating their feast.” The police needed to remove some over-exuberant individuals from the field of play Credit: REX FEATURES \nT his bonhomie, this sense of wonder, prevailed throughout the club, despite the obvious strain of hosting Premier League household names for a live TV spectacle likely to be witnessed by millions. Yet the logistical stress of lurching from Vanarama National League to prime time Monday night lights was not going to distort the character of this place. \nIn the club shop, a particularly cosy portakabin, an older world or anorakish devotion to community football exerted its quiet magnetism. Inside was an archived array of old programmes; Sutton pencils, Sutton rulers, and more club histories than many professional clubs could lay before a visiting audience.

This tactic seemed of questionable value to a non-league team facing aristocrats known for their slick passing. But, hey, why change the routine for a team hammered 5-1 last week, even if it was at Bayern Munich? Police were forced to remove flares that were thrown onto the pitch Credit: REX FEATURES \nA rsenal’s breakthrough arrived when Lucas Perez dashed down Sutton’s left and fired a low shot that flipped Ross Worner off his feet on its way to the net. A second goal, by Theo Walcott, had Arsenal’s fans bouncing in a stand so low they were in danger of banging their heads. But they, too, were in tune with the spirit of the night. “Lincoln City,” they sang - “we’re coming for you.” \nIt would be a shame if this night were remembered only for a self-publicist wolfing a pie.
