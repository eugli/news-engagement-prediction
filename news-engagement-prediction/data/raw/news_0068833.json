The EU, on some occasions, had appeared sympathetic to Pakistan's demands. \n\nReferring to the Indian government refusing to renew the foreign funding licences of around 20,000 NGOs, another prominent member of the Committee Preda Cristian Dan said crackdown on NGOs dealing with human rights issues was unacceptable. \n\nHe said some EU member countries also donated money to NGOs for promoting human rights and wondered why authorities in some countries restricted their activities. \n\n\"We do not understand why government wants to block activities of organisations dealing with human rights. This is unacceptable,\" Dan said. \n\nHe said the problems of NGOs working for the rights of children and women in India will be flagged by the delegation during its meeting with Women and Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi.
