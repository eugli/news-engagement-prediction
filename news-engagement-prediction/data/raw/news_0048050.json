David Sutton, 61, was due to be jailed for making or possessing more than 940 indecent images of children and 169 films. He had previously run a blog from Hull Crown Court calling for criminals to be given tougher sentences. Ahead of a planned sentencing hearing at the court yesterday, he brought out a blade he is believed to have smuggled into the dock from prison and tried to cut his wrist. He was restrained and handcuffed and taken to a cell at the court, where he was treated for a wound to his hand. Police raided his home on January 12 last year and discovered the images on his computer, which included children as young as two being violently abused. In total, Sutton had 119 images at Category A, the most serious, 141 at Category B, and 681 Category C images. He also had 25 prohibited images, or drawings. Sutton had 96 Category A movies, 72 at Category B, and one at Category C. Sutton had previously blogged from the court, calling for tougher sentences for criminals He also had an application on his mobile phone which showed he had discussed indecent images with others. Jailing Sutton for 18 months, Judge Berry called the images \"vile\", and said: \"I have described an image involving a child in a clearly distressed state, and I'm told that the police officers watching it were distressed whilst doing so.\" RELATED ARTICLES", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:16:18.383+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
