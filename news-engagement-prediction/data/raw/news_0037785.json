Since Mystery Science Theater 3000 first made its debut on a local Minneapolis station nearly 30 years ago, it’s been refit for a variety of media—including a feature film, a book, and live riffing events. Now the beloved sci-fi series, which pokes fun at some of the best worst films in the cinematic universe, is getting the comic book treatment. \nEarlier today, Dark Horse Comics—the publisher behind Frank Miller’s Sin City — announced on its blog that it has partnered with the funny folks at Mystery Science Theater 3000 to produce both a new comic book series as well as a line of MST3K -branded products. \nThough the show debuted in 1988, it still maintains a rabid fan base, as creator Joel Hodgson proved in 2015 when he launched a Kickstarter campaign to bring the series back and create a line of merchandise—and promptly raised more than $6.3 million from fans. Netflix, which will stream the reboot, has yet to announce a firm premiere date for the new series (which will see Jonah Ray take over hosting duties), but production began last year , so a 2017 air date seems likely. While details on the new comic book series are also very limited, Dark Horse’s vice president of publishing, Randy Stradley, can hardly contain his excitement. “I first encountered the show in 1992, and immediately fell in love with both the concept and the characters,” Stradley said. “I began inquiring about the license in 1993, and now—a mere 24 years later—we have Comics Sign!” Here’s hoping both the new show and the comic book series drop in the not-too-distant future.
