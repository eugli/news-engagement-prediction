If yes, head to the wilderness for a weekend camping trip. It restores circadian cycle and helps improve sleep, claim American researchers. \nA team of researchers from the University of Colorado, Boulder, found that spending at least a weekend camping with no artificial light sources — enjoying natural sunlight during the day and total darkness at night — can help reset the body’s circadian rhythm and help people fall asleep. \nCircadian rhythms are essentially the internal “body clock,” defining the body’s day and night with physical, mental and behavioural changes in response to light and darkness, based on a cycle of approximately 24 hours. Disruption to these rhythms can lead to sleep problems and various physical (such as diabetes), psychological, cognitive and behavioural consequences.

Volunteers were sent on a week-long camping trip where they were exposed to four times more natural light than usual. \nOn their return, the researchers found that the characteristic rise in melatonin — a hormone that promotes sleep and prepares the body for nighttime — happened two hours earlier, around the time of sunset. If a camping trip isn’t an option, maximize your exposure to natural daylight and shut off smartphones and laptops well before bedtime, advise researchers.

The campers maintained their regular weekday sleep schedule rather than sleeping in later like those who stayed at home. Two days after they returned, after testing their saliva for melatonin, the researchers found that the campers’ melatonin rise had shifted 1.4 hours earlier.

Their melatonin levels were then tested every hour for 24 hours. The campers had been exposed to an average 13 times as much natural daylight as in their usual weekday environment. All the participants went to bed earlier and slept for longer. Their melatonin levels also began to rise 2.6 hours earlier than usual. \nThe researchers conclude that since their body clocks weren’t thrown off by artificial light, the campers’ biological night naturally lengthened in line with the season, as with many animals. \nWhen camping trips aren’t an option, the authors recommend maximizing exposure to natural daylight and shutting off smartphones and laptops well before bedtime. \nFollow @htlifeandstyle for more ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T23:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:54:47.281+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
