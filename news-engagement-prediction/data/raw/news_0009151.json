'If it's unusually rough weather and we lose too much water, we postpone shows - a safety precaution for our divers who are jumping, like Cecile, from as high as 55 feet. This is uncommon though.' Cesilie Carlton, a 35-year-old American high diver, is first seen limbering up atop the 55-ft high platform She then leaps off headfirst and performs several somersaults into the pool underneath The Harmony of the Seas cruise ship is the largest passenger liner in the world boasts a 2,100-strong crew, of which 20 are performers at the AquaTheater seen in the video Performers typically stay on the ship for six to nine months at a time, putting on regular shows for their spectators. 'We always begin with rehearsals at our entertainment facility in South Florida and then have about two weeks to bring the show to life onboard,' Sydney explains. Cesilie won the first gold medal for her country at the 2013 World Aquatics Championships, and now travels regularly to compete showcase her skills. In 2015, Cesilie won a silver medal in the Women's High Diving 20m final at the 16th FINA World Championships in Kazan Cesilie, pictured, who is also currently a Red Bull cliff diver, has amassed more than 250,000 views on Instagram since the footage was posted last week The impressive and frankly terrifying video was shot ship by her colleague, fellow diver Sydney Brown, pictured Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T17:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T13:06:06.389+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
