David Unwin/Fairfax NZ. \nKurt was admitted to hospice on Friday. \nOn Friday he was admitted into the hospice, and it was unclear how much longer he had left. The cancer has spread to his bones and brain. \nREAD MORE: \n\"We had struggled for a few years, Seddon said, \"but when we were working, we started to get into a decent position for once in our lives and it was all snatched away.\" \n\"Some days I think I'm cursed.\" \nBroom quit his job in order to care for Seddon, but their final days together had become \"a nightmare\". \nLiving off $250 a week in benefits, they could no longer afford the house they had been renting and were now in a state house. \nThey struggle to pay their bills and put food on the table. \n\"It is a nightmare and it is every week. Every day you wake up and you know what it is going to be like,\" Broom said. \n\"There were weeks where we only had potatoes and bread. \n\"It just gets worse because Kurt is getting worse. I'm at the point of giving up. \n\"He hasn't got a lot of time left and I should be able to concentrate on him.\" \nThe couple are no strangers to bad luck. Three years ago, while the pair were living in Whanganui, they were victims of a home invasion. \nBut since Seddon's illness, they have also felt let down. They have lost faith in the health system, believing the cancer should have been picked up earlier. \nSeddon noticed a big mole on his thigh that had changed colour in late 2015. He could not afford a GP visit, so went to Palmerston North Hospital's Emergency Department. \nHe said he was told the mole was not cancerous, but was advised to see his GP. \nBroom said because they could not afford it, they left it at that, with the understanding the mole was not cancerous. \nWhen Seddon's health worsened, he went back to hospital in March 2016 where a biopsy confirmed he had stage four melanoma. \nMidCentral DHB clinical services and transformation general manager Mike Grant said when Seddon first visited the emergency department he was assessed and advised that he mole did not require immediate treatment. \n\"The ED doctor discussed Mr Seddon's situation with him, including his personal circumstances. Mr Seddon's GP was advised about his visit to ED. He was strongly advised to follow up with his GP. \n\"We are sorry that Mr Seddon did not follow up with his GP.\" \nGrant said GPs were best placed to manage skin changes. \nWhile caring for his dying husband, Broom said he was asked by a WINZ staff member when they could return to work. \nHowever, Ministry of Social Development regional commissioner Katie Brosnahan said neither man had any obligations to work or to actively look for a job. \nBrosnahan said Broom's exemption to work had lapsed, resulting in a letter being sent asking about his work capacity. \n\"This should not have happened and we have apologised.\" \nBrosnahan said they did not have a record of Seddon being asked in person about a return to work. Saturday is World Cancer Day. Russell Broom has set up a Givealittle page. Search for 'Kurt Seddon'. An earlier Givealittle page, started by a third party, titled 'Melanoma Stage 4 Terminal', had been closed. The couple claim the person who started the page was not passing on all the funds. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T14:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T11:01:45.316+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
