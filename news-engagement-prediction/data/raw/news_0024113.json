If convicted, Miller could face up to 10 years in prison. Her sentencing hearing is scheduled for Feb. 24. In October 2015, Miller was accused of illegally trying to hide $775,000 worth of income from Dance Moms and the Lifetime show's spinoff projects when she filed for Chapter 11. At the time, she pleaded not guilty. Miller was later charged with 20 counts of bankruptcy fraud , concealing assets, and one criminal count involving international monetary information. Judge Terrence McVerry said at the time that if convicted of the charges, Miller could face fines of up to $500,000 and a maximum of six to 10 years in prison. \"I don't know. I don't want to make light of it. I don't want to make fun of it,\" Miller continued. \"It's very serious. But, there's a lot of strange, unanswered questions.
