I was maybe three or four. \n\"I didn't start playing till years after but I really liked the fiddle from then on.\" \nHe said he was \"amazed and so pleased\" to scoop the prestigious award, which is part of the Celtic Connections festival. \nMr Stewart also plays with two bands - Dosca and Levack, Stewart, Irving - and he has performed all over Europe. High calibre competition \nIn 2016, he reached the semi-finals of the BBC Radio 2 Young Folk Awards, playing with harpist Becky Hill. \nNow he has been named the young traditional musician of the year, he wins a recording session with the BBC and a year-long membership of the Musicians Union. \nJeff Zycinski, head of radio at BBC Scotland, said: \"Charlie is exactly the type of performer we wanted to shine the spotlight on when we launched the search for this year's winner. His stunning performance was both moving and spirited and really captivated the audience. \n\"Every year, the judging process becomes more difficult with musicians of such a high calibre coming through the ranks. Our six finalists were magnificent, each one stamping their set with true individuality and flair. \n\"It was an extremely difficult choice, but Charlie stood out on the night. He will really help to inspire and encourage the next generation of young artists to keep traditional music alive.\" \nPrevious winners have used their victory as a springboard to a professional career in music. They include last year's winner, concertina virtuoso Mohsen Amini, and singer Robyn Stapleton, who won in 2014. \nThe other finalists this year were piper Dougie McCance, from Erskine; Ella Munro, a singer from Skye; accordion player Grant McFarlane, from Paisley; Huntly-based singer Iona Fyfe; and Kim Carnie, a Gaelic singer who is originally from Oban. \nListen to the final of BBC Scotland's Young Traditional Musician 2017 on the BBC iPlayer .
