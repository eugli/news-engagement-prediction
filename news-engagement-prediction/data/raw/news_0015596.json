Daily Edition The 'Grey Gardens' Estate in East Hampton Hits the Market for $19.9M 3:46 PM PST 2/8/2017 by Peter Kiefer COMMENTS Courtesy of The Corcoran Group The home became famed for its eccentric owners \"Big Edie\" and \"Little Edie\" and the house — along with its owners — became the subject of a 1975 documentary and later a Broadway musical and HBO Film. \nThe home may be found at 3 West End Road in East Hampton but it is known as Grey Gardens, a name which entered the modern lexicon after the house became the subject first of a 1975 documentary and later of a Broadway musical and HBO Film. And now, for the first time in almost 40 years Grey Gardens is on the market, for $19.995 million. \nAt that price tag, clearly much has changed since the 12-room, 6,000-square-foot shingle-style home came to national attention on account of its disrepair, courtesy of its eccentric inhabitants “Big Edie” and “Little Edie,” the aunt and first cousin — respectively — of Jackie Kennedy Onassis. \nIn 1979 Little Edie sold the home to journalist Sally Quinn and the late Ben Bradlee, who was the longtime editor of The Washington Post , under one condition: that Quinn and Bradlee not tear down the structure and rebuild. Five years later Quinn recounted the discovery of the home in an article for Architectural Digest , where she wrote: \n“Inside, the cat smell was overpowering. The floor was part dirt. The ceiling was caving in. Raccoons peered at me through the rafters. Some 20 cats scurried as we entered each room. Still I thought it was the prettiest house I had ever seen.” \nGrey Gardens was originally built in 1897, and features seven bedrooms, six and a half bathrooms, and ample space for entertaining on 1.7 acres of land near Lily Pond Lane and Georgica Beach. The grounds feature ocean views, a pool, tennis court, and, of course, the famed gardens. \n“It took many years to restore, everything was redone but it still has the look and feel of an old house. It’s American folklore and has such a rich history,” said the Corcoran Group’s Michael Schultz who is the listing agent on the home. “It is a rare opportunity for someone who appreciates old houses but that is a specific kind of buyer, especially in the Hamptons these days.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T18:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T13:21:42.298+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
