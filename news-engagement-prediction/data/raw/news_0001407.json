'More pigs than ever' \nThe lower levels of pork reserves were pointed out by the Ohio Pork Council, a lobby group for pig farmers. Image copyright Twitter \nBut it later claimed that the observation - as well as the setting up of a baconshortage.com website (which now seems to have been taken down) - was not intended to create concern. \n\"Today's pig farmers are setting historic records by producing more pigs than ever,\" Ohio Pork Council president Rich Deaton said. \nMarket analysts expect US pork production to rise by about 3% this year, with more processing plants in the pipeline to meet the increased demand. \nBacon is a staple in many breakfasts, burgers and barbeques, particularly in America. \nMajor restaurant chains like Wendy's and McDonald's have also contributed to increased bacon demand after introducing all-day breakfast menus. \nPork belly prices also hit their highest level in more than a year on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange this week. Image copyright Twitter Image caption The rumours have given graphic designers the chance to show their creative streak \nAs a result, traders say wholesale pork belly prices are about 37% higher than they were at the same time last year, though this has not yet translated to significantly higher prices for consumers. \nHowever bacon eaters will likely see the higher prices in about three months, David Maloni, president of research firm American Restaurant Association told Reuters. \nIt is not just in the US where pork availability - and prices - are a serious matter. \nIn China, the world's largest pork consumer, the government has on occasions intervened by releasing more of the meat onto the market to curb prices and help control inflation.
