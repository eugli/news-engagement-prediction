Initially, Wershe, a former police informant, was sentenced to life in prison without parole but he is now serving life with the possibility of parole because of drug law changes. \nMichael Eagen, the chairman of the parole board, is scheduled to interview Wershe at 8:30 a.m. , said Ralph Musilli, Wershe’s longtime attorney, who plans to be with him during the interview \n“He’s allowed to have a friend with him,” he said. “And he has asked me to be there.” \nMusilli said the interview is expected to take 30 to 45 minutes and his client will be asked about several topics, including his plans and whether he has a support network if released on parole. \nRelated: Jailed as teens, some Michigan murderers get shot at freedom \nWershe, 47, an inmate at the Oak Correctional Facility in Manistee, will be interviewed at the prison though a video connection, said Chris Gautz, a spokesman with the Michigan Department of Corrections. The interviewer will offer his recommendation after the interview, but there's not a set time when that will happen. \nThe meeting, which is not open to the public, could lead to a hearing where the public is allowed to attend. If it gets to that point, a public hearing would take place around June, Gautz said. \nWershe’s only public hearing was in 2003. \nAt that time, Kid Rock, who knows Wershe from their teenage years, and some FBI agents urged for his release but some agents for the Drug Enforcement Administration, police and prosecutors urged that he stay locked up. \nA transcript of the hearing showed the parole board received objections from then Wayne County Prosecutor Mike Duggan. Last year, Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said she was reviewing her office’s position on Wershe’s case amid an examination of juvenile life without parole murder cases. \n“We will have no position and will leave the decision entirely up to the parole board,” Worthy said in a statement Monday about how her office will proceed with Wershe's case. \nA legal battle has surrounded the controversial case for years and at least one movie is in the works. \nWershe, who was denied parole in 2003, 2007 and 2012, stashed eight kilos of high-grade powdered cocaine and nearly $30,000 in 1987, officials said. \nIn 2015, Wayne County Circuit Judge Dana Hathaway said Wershe was \"entitled to be resentenced\" for his 1988 conviction \"with consideration given to his youth and the circumstances surrounding the crime.\" The decision was reversed by the Michigan Court of Appeals after the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office appealed and argued Hathaway's ruling was \"without authority.\" \nMusilli called it \"absolutely absurd\" that Wershe is still in prison after 29 years. Musilli, and others, have said Wershe was used by the government to infiltrate the drug trade in Detroit as a teenager. Musilli said people Wershe later helped put away, including cops, are out. \nWhile behind bars in Florida in the federal witness protection program, Wershe was accused of being involved in a stolen car scheme. He pleaded guilty to two felonies, including racketeering, in 2006 and was sentenced to five years in prison, officials said. \nSo even if he's released on parole in Michigan, he may not walk free yet. \n“Every indication we’ve seen is that Florida wants him to be brought to them to continue to serve his time with them,” Gautz said. \nContact Elisha Anderson: eanderson@freepress.com or 313-222-5144.
