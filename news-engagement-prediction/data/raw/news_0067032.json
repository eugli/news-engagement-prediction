The Bible study at Branch AME had been canceled that night, the church's Rev. Rufus Berry told the Post and Courier newspaper . Even if the gathering hadn't been canceled, it would've been over by the time Roof arrived, he said. But Berry told the Charleston newspaper that he was unsettled by the news. Research on other black churches The GPS data suggested it wasn't the first time Roof had gone near Branch AME Church. He had driven past the same church four months before, according to prosecutors. After his arrest, Roof told officers that he had researched other black churches. He told them that he considered several targets including a \"black festival\" before deciding to attack Emanuel AME. Investigators also found a handwritten list of mostly black churches, which included addresses, phone numbers and hours of worship. Second church didn't come up during trial Roof's defense attorneys sought to exclude the GPS data along with two photographs of the Branch AME Church from trial. They argued the evidence was \"irrelevant,\" and Roof had driven past the church. But prosecutors argued there is \"no commercial activity on the road where Branch AME is located that would otherwise prompted Defendant to stop at that location,\" in court documents. The GPS data was not presented during his trial. Roof, a white supremacist, was found guilty on of all 33 federal charges and sentenced to death. He is the first person to get the death penalty for a federal hate crime.
