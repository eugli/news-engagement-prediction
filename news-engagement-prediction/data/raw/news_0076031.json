He almost caused accidents with the vehicles in front of him, as well, after driving too closely behind them, according to authorities. \nPolice claim Elam failed to abide by their attempted traffic stop, as he accelerated instead of yielding immediately. Upon the stop, officers detected a strong scent of marijuana and a cloud of smoke emitting from Elam’s vehicle. \nUpon search, authorities discovered 162.2 grams of marijuana, six oxycodone pills weighing 3.1 grams and nearly $1,000. One of Elam’s passengers, Calvin Stewart, also possessed a semi-loaded automatic pistol, which he did not have a permit to carry. \nThe Ravens released a statement following the news of the arrest, saying “We are aware of the arrest of Matt Elam. Matt is not in our plans for the 2017 Ravens.” \nIn Oct. 2015, Elam was issued a one-game suspension for violating the NFL’s substance-abuse policy, an incident that he self-reported, according to team officials. \nBaltimore drafted Elam with the 32nd pick in the first round of the 2013 NFL Draft. In four seasons with the Ravens, he registered 86 tackles and one interception. \nElam is set to become a free agent next month after the Ravens elected not to pick up his fifth-year option. \nThumbnail photo via Evan Habeeb/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T06:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T16:03:16.625+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
