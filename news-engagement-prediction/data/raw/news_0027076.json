We have analysed them and they will have analysed us. I have been working on our tactical plan and we do not feel inferior to anyone,” Emery stated at a news conference. \n“We have some important players who want to make history with PSG. Personal duels will be key. Tactics are very important, but it is all about winning your battles on the pitch. \n“This tie is a good opportunity to show where we stand. It’s a chance that we have to exploit. It is important because the Champions League is an important goal for us. \n“We have to take our responsibilities and do everything to win.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T11:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T09:26:04.611+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
