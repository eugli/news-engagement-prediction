It was while the man was eating lunch that Keats says he started showing signs of distress.\n\"I noticed there was a large amount of peanut butter bread in his mouth. He's got a tendency of not chewing sometimes,\" Keats told the Central Morning Show .\n\"So I took some out with a spoon, got him up and started the Heimlich maneuver and couldn't dislodge the object from his mouth. A little while after he went non-responsive.\"\nAs a Family Tony's son Cole and daughter Toni just happened to be home at the time.\n\"I gotta give thanks to my son and my daughter who just jumped right into that mode and said 'we gotta do this and we gotta get this done',\" he said.\nKeats credits his family's CPR training for saving a man's life recently.
