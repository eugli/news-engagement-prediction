First, she said that the Obama administration banned Iraqi refugees from entering in the United States for six months in 2011 — which is flatly untrue.\nSecond, and more significantly, she made up a terrorist attack committed by Iraqi refugees that never happened — the \"Bowling Green Massacre\":\nTweet 1\nJoe Sonka is, to be clear, 100 percent correct about this. There has never been a terrorist attack in Bowling Green, Kentucky committed by Iraqi refugees.\nConway claims that \"most people don't know that because it didn't get covered.\" Most people don't know about it because it didn't happen.\nWhere Conway is coming from (I think) show chapters Seth Meyers grills Kellyanne Conway over Trump Russia briefings Wednesday, 11 Jan 2017 | 9:59 AM ET | 00:32 In 2011, two Iraqi refugees, Waad Ramadan Alwan and Mohanad Shareef Hammadi, were arrested in Bowling Green, KY, on federal terrorism charges. Allegedly, they had been plotting to send money and weapons back home to Iraqi insurgents.\nDuring the investigation, the FBI found something worrying: fingerprints from Alwan on a roadside bomb in Iraq. This suggested there was a very specific flaw in America's refugee screening process: Databases of fingerprints from Iraqi militants were not well-integrated into the broader State Department–run refugee admissions process. As a result, the Obama administration initiated a new review of all roughly 57,000 Iraqi refugees who had been recently admitted into the United States.\nThis process was manpower- and time-intensive, and resulted in a significant slowdown in Iraqi refugee admissions to the United States for six months. But it was not a ban, as Conway, Trump, and many in the conservative media claimed: Refugees from Iraq entered the United States in all six months.\nSo, to recap:\nNo one was killed by refugees in Bowling Green. There was never even a plan to kill anyone in Bowling Green. There was no ban on Iraqi refugee admissions afterwards. It is, I suppose, possible that Conway was referring to the other Bowling Green Massacre, which is a local haunted house.\n(Disclosure: CNBC parent NBCUniversal is an investor in Vox Media. )\nFollow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook .", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/cnbcinternational", "https://twitter.com/joesonka/status/827344429086289921", "https://twitter.com/cnbci"], "published": "2017-02-03T07:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T07:36:26.078+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
