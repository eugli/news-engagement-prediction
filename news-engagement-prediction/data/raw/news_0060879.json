Kaspersky, the well-known anti-virus company, has announced a secure-by-design operating system called the KasperskyOS which will work on network devices, Internet of Things and industrial control systems. The company has come up with the new secure environment software after working for 14 long years, also running a real-world pilot test roll out. The company says that the OS is now available for use in many scenarios. Kaspersky said that the basic idea behind this product was to create a secure OS to fight the ever-growing cyber threats in computing devices. KasperskyOS or KOS will possibly on all platforms like Windows, MacOS and Linux in connected devices. The OS has three main components – 1. KOS, 2. a standalone secure hypervisor (KSH) and 3. a system for secure interaction between OS components. Kaspersky posted details about the new OS on its website, and here are some of the details which you might want to know about the system:\n1. Kaspersky OS is and operating system designed from scratch on a modular lightweight microkernel. The kernel can be implemented on several platforms — giving one freedom to modify it, including with another kernel as well. KOS’ independent security engine allows users to dictate the policy which goes well with their security requirements. The security policy can be customised for individual applications as well.\n2. “This is not Linux. It’s literally not Linux; there’s not a single string of Linux code in it. We designed the OS from scratch, for different applications and purposes. What matters most for Linux, Windows, MacOS and the like is compatibility and universality. The developers do their utmost to popularise their solutions by oversimplifying app development and toolsets. But when it comes to our target audiences (hardware developers, SCADA systems, IoT, etc.), this approach is a no-go: What matters most here is security.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:38:28.746+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
