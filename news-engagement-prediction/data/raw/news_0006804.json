Jeff Sessions as attorney general. \nThe 11-9 vote came a day later than expected, after Senate Democrats doubled down on their opposition to the nomination during a Tuesday meeting. Democrats questioned Mr. Sessions’ ability to function independently from Mr. Trump , pointing to the president’s Monday night dismissal of acting attorney general Sally Q. Yates as a need for independence in the office. \nThe opposition continued Wednesday ahead of the vote as Sen. Al Franken raised questions about Mr. Trump ’s earlier pledges to investigate allegations of voter fraud in the 2016 election. While Mr. Trump obtained enough votes through the electoral college to win, he lost the popular vote to Democratic nominee Hilary Clinton by about 2.8 million votes. \n“Before the members of this committee vote on Sen. Sessions’ nomination, we deserve to know whether the president intends for the attorney general or the Justice Department to lead this investigation,” Mr. Franken said. “When the president of the United States lies about the existence of massive widespread fraud, it is the job of the attorney general to call him out on it. The attorney general has an obligation to tell it like it is.” \nMr. Franked pointed to Mr. Sessions own questioning of Ms. Yates before she was confirmed as deputy attorney general by the Senate Judiciary Committee, specifically questioning her then about whether she believed the attorney general or deputy attorney general had a responsibility to tell the president “no” if he tried to enact unlawful orders. \n“You have to watch out because people will be asking you to do things and you just have to say no,” Mr. Sessions was quoted by Mr. Franken as saying then. \nMs. Yates was fired and replaced Monday after she defiantly announced her refusal to defend in court the president’s executive order banning refugees and travelers from some Muslim countries. \nSen. Dianne Feinstein said Tuesday that Ms. Yates’ actions “took guts.” \n“That is what an attorney general must be willing and able to do,” the California Democrat said. “I have no confidence that Senator Sessions will do that.” \nMr. Trump ’s order, signed Friday, indefinitely halts the resettlement of Syrian refugees in the U.S. and temporarily bars travel to the U.S. by nearly all citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries. \nMr. Sessions nomination will now advance to the full Senate , where Republicans hold a 52-seat majority in the 100-seat body.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T23:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T20:20:08.064+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
