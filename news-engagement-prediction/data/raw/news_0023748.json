All she needed now was a final “yes” from him. \nDraughon had no idea that his decision to would lead him to become part of an eight-person “paired kidney exchange.” \n“We tell them you’re not able to donate to this person, but, there’s the paired exchange program, where we put you guys into a computer database with other pairs in the same situation and we try to find a match for both of you at the same time. So it’s an equal exchange,” Burnett said. \nIt’s a bit like the TV series “Wife Swap,” joked Dr. Bobby Nibhanupudy, one of the directors of abdominal and pancreas transplant programs at Florida Hospital. \nBurnett and Draughon, 33, had been in contact for several months. \nThe tall, soft-spoken Oviedo police officer had first sent in an application to donate a kidney to fellow law enforcement officer, Seminole County Deputy Blayne Badura, 45, whose kidneys were slowly succumbing to a form of kidney disease. \nDraughon is the type who always wants to save people’s lives, his wife, Amanda, will tell you. \n“I thought I’m healthy and this is something I can do,” Draughon said on Tuesday during a media event at Florida Hospital. \nBut when he learned that he wasn’t a match for Badura, he decided to be part of the paired kidney exchange. \n“They said my kidney wouldn’t go to him, but it would ensure that he receives one in return [if I donated my kidney],” said Draughon. “So I said as long as he can get a kidney, that’s all that matters.” \nTo Burnett his agreement meant “that everybody is going to get transplanted and they’re going to get to donate. It’s awesome,” she said. \nThe first of this type of paired exchanges took place more than two decades ago, according to data from the federal Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. Transplant center staff enter eligible donor and recipient medical information into the national organ sharing network, which then searches for cases where the donor in each pair is compatible with the recipient in another pair or pairs. \nPaired organ exchanges aren’t as common as the better-known one-to-one organ donations, but the concept is growing, partly because of social media. \n“It’s really getting bigger and bigger, because people are learning about it,” Burnett said. \nIn 2016, there were 625 paired donations in the United States, the highest number ever recorded by the transplantation network. \nFlorida Hospital implemented its paired exchange program in 2008 and performed two paired exchanges last year, resulting in four transplants. \nSign up for the weekly Health Report newsletter » \nExperts say that paired kidney exchanges can help some patients find a matching organ quicker. Badura, for instance, could have been waiting for five or sixyears on the typical waiting list. \nBut the two law enforcement officers’ decision to participate in the paired kidney exchange program changed everything. Two weeks later, the Florida Hospital team had found Badura a match. \nBadura’s donor turned out to be Lauren Gau of Winter Springs. She and her mother had decided to take part in the paired kidney exchange too, because they weren’t a good match. \nGau’s mom, Leslie, had already received a kidney from an anonymous donor in the Midwest, who was also in the exchange program. That Midwest donor’s pair had received a kidney from another donor in the Southeast. \nNow it was Gau’s turn to give a kidney in exchange for the one her mother had received. \nThat match turned out to be Deputy Badura. \nIn exchange, Draughon donated his kidney to someone in the Pacific Northwest. And that person’s donor is waiting to be matched. \nThis eight-person kidney exchange isn’t common because so many elements have to be aligned for it to happen, said Dr. Giridhar Vedula, a multi-organ abdominal transplant surgeon at Florida Hospital Transplant Institute. \nIt took Burnett and her colleague Sue Kerkhof several conference calls, reviews of medical records and conversations with surgeons and transplant centers to coordinate it all, but in the end Officer Draughon, Deputy Badura and Lauren Gau had their surgeries on the same January day this year. \nAnd when everything is done and everyone’s OK, “it’s like wow,” said Kerkhof. “We see all the preparation that it takes and seeing all come together is my wow moment.” \nDraughon is returning to work on Wednesday. He knew his recovery would be painful, especially at first, but he’s well now. \n“I’m very happy with my decision. I couldn’t feel better. And to help more than one person at once is more than what I bargained for,” he said. \nHe had this one last thing to add: “Donating a kidney is life altering, but it’s not going to change to quality of your life at all. It’s something that people should seriously consider,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:27:13.574+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
