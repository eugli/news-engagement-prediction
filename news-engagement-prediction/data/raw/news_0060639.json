(Picture: PA /Getty/Metro) \nManchester United are the big favourites to win this weekend’s EFL Cup final at Wembley. \nHowever, before we start crowning Jose Mourinho with his first trophy since taking over at Old Trafford, it’s worth looking a little closer at their opponents Southampton . Keep smiling! Mourinho of all people melts hearts with touching message to Ranieri \nThere might be 18 points between them in the Premier League and many more millions worth of players among Mourinho’s squad, but we’ve found many reasons to believe it could be Claude Puel’s side lifting the League Cup trophy on Sunday. 1. Time to prepare \nBy the time the sides walk out under the Wembley arch it will have been 15 days since Southampton last played. The huge gap will have given Puyel time with his players to meticulously prepare for the match, both tactically and from a fitness point of view. Saints forward Nathan Redmond hinted as much: ‘We are working on our game plan this week which we will have to try and implement,’ he revealed. Redmond and his team-mates will be all geared up (Getty) \nIn contrast, since Southampton beat Sunderland 4-0 on February 11, Manchester United have played three times – in the FA Cup against Blackburn and twice against St Etienne in the Europa League. Mourinho saw his side win all three matches but used star players in all of the games. Those that aren’t injured have to be tired . 2. History \nThis won’t be the first time Southampton have faced Manchester United in a final at Wembley. The pair made it through to the 1976 FA Cup final and it was Saints who prevailed. As in Sunday’s meeting, Southampton were the underdogs; they were a Second Division team while United ended the campaign third in Division One. But Bobby Stokes’ 83rd minute goal was the difference between the sides and delivered Southampton’s first (and still only) major trophy.

In every round they faced Premier League opposition, starting with Crystal Palace and then Sunderland. They then saw off Arsenal at the Emirates and Liverpool in the semi-final – two teams higher in the league than Manchester United.

They have a secret weapon \nManolo Gabbiadini, signed during the January transfer window, has scored in every game he’s played for Southampton so far. Okay, it’s only two games, but the former Napoli striker has looked sensational in scoring a brace against Sunderland last time out and a goal on his debut against West Ham. The Italian could just provide the edge. Could he be the hero on Sunday (Getty) \n‘Manolo showed he is a technical player who can work between the lines. He gets behind defenders and has real quality,’ Puel said of his £14million deadline day acquisition. 5. Impenetrable defence \nSouthampton have not conceded a single goal so far in the tournament – 450 minutes that has seen them travel to Arsenal and Liverpool and keep a clean sheet. Against a side noted for its wastefulness in front of goal, it bodes well. \n‘I think we’re the first team to not concede a goal in the competition so that will be the foundation,’ Redmond told EASports.com .
