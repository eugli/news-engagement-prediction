He said Flynn was asked to resign only because he misled Vice President Mike Pence about those discussions. \n“I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence — very simple,” Trump said. \nHe said “it certainly would have been ok with me\" if Flynn discussed sanctions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak when President Obama was still in office. \n“I didn’t direct him, but I would have directed him if he didn’t do it,” Trump said. \nFlynn's discussion of sanctions was considered inappropriate, and possibly illegal, while another administration was still setting U.S. policy. \nTrump also promised to issue a new version of his travel ban next week, and he vowed would withstand court scrutiny. \nHe complained that his many accomplishments were not being recognized while insisting that his much criticized early weeks in office were going smoothly. He even said his travel ban worked without a hitch, despite numerous problems at airports around the country. \nTrump hedged several questions asking him to clearly state that no one in his campaign had contacted Russians before the election, saying repeatedly that he himself had no involvement with the government. He also said that political controversy would make it hard to cut a wide-ranging deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin but that he was nonetheless committed. \nThe news conference was a return to Trump's more spontaneous public side that characterized his campaign. He sparred with the press, bragged falsely about the size of his campaign victory, boasted of his television ratings and continued to take shots at Hillary Clinton. \n“I won with news conferences,” he said, as if explaining why he chose to hold the impromptu news conference. \nTrump, while complaining relentlessly about what he said was unfair coverage, nonetheless insisted that he was having a good time. \n“Tomorrow, they will say, 'Donald Trump rants and raves about the press,'\" he said. \"I'm not ranting and raving.” Latest updates", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T02:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T21:46:38.086+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
