(Photo: I-League) Mumbai: An intense match between Mumbai FC and Bengaluru FC ended in a goalless stalemate in the I-League here today, continuing the defending champions' winless run and dealing a blow to their title aspirations.\nHeading towards the match, both the sides were on a poor run of form. Mumbai FC started off brilliantly after keeping the majority of the ball possession. As the match proceeded, defending champions Bengaluru FC quickly settled into the game.\nThe first opportunity came in the 12th minute when Mumbai FC's Reagan Singh put across a perfect cross to Farukh Choudhary, whose header was brilliantly saved by Bengaluru FC's custodian Amrinder Singh.\nA couple of minutes later, Alberto Roca's side got their first chance when captain Sunil Chhetri's shot sailed over the bar. With over 3,600-odd fans at the Cooperage Stadium, the vocal members of the West Block Blues and the Yellow Brigade made sure to motivate their respective clubs.\nIn the 27th minute, Bengaluru FC got another chance when Alwyn George and Daniel Lalhlimpuia launched a brilliant counter only to see Alwyn's shot being saved by Kattimani.\nTwo minutes later, Daniel saw his looping header saved by Kattimani again after Udanta Singh put a brilliant cross.\nThe second half was livelier than the first. Both the sides got an equal number of opportunities but in the end, it was the defence which prevailed over the attack.\nBengaluru FC almost scored the winner in the dying minutes when Sunil Chhetri's effort was cleared off the line by defender Sharityar.\nFor his impressive performance, Mumbai FC's captain Theobald Denzel got the man of the match award.\nWith this draw, Mumbai FC remain stranded on the eighth spot with as many points, whereas, Bengaluru FC move to the fourth spot with thirteen points playing one match shy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T16:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T06:51:13.756+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
