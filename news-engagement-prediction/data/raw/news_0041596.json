Garland was at the remand centre waiting to be transferred to a federal institution. \nKim said he expects his client to return to the jail later on Saturday. \nPolice did not identify the victim, but said a 57-year-old inmate was seriously injured after being assaulted by several other inmates. The victim was taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, police said. \nOn Friday afternoon, Garland was sentenced to 75 years in prison without parole for the grisly murders of five-year-old Nathan O’Brien and his grandparents, Alvin and Kathy Liknes. \nWith files from CTV Calgary and the Canadian Press Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T02:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:19:01.872+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
