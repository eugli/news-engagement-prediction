Risa Hontiveros files a bill in the Senate proposing a more holistic approach to the drug problem in the country. Philstar.com/File \nMANILA, Philippines â€” Stressing that the country cannot kill its way out of its drug problem, Sen. Risa Hontiveros filed on Monday a measure that would take a holistic approach to solving the drug problem in the country. \nIn proposing the bill, Hontiveros criticized the government's anti-drug campaign which she described as \"corrupt and abusive.\" She labeled the government program as an ineffective \"simplistic crime and punishment approach.\" \nThe measure filed by Hontiveros, contained in Senate Bill 1313, proposes two prongs to fight the problem of illicit drugs in the Philippines: a comprehensive public health component and a \"rules-based and modern drug law enforcement strategy\" component. \nHontiveros said that her bill aims to provide a comprehensive approach to the country's drug policy and create barangay-based programs and issues for drug-related issues and concerns. \n\"There is a need for a new and sustainable strategy that is humane, rehabilitative and less susceptible to abuse,\" Hontiveros said. \nSignaling a shift from simple punishment to treatment, Hontiveros said that they would start implementing the new strategy in barangays especially those in Pasay and Caloocan which were severely \"savaged\" by Oplan Tokhang. Headlines ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1 \nHontiveros highlighted that the needs of those who do not need to be committed in rehabilitation centers must be addressed. According to her, based on data from the Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB), 91 percent of the over one million drug users who expressed they are willing to access treatment do not need \"institutionalized intervention.\" \n\"Without any program to address their needs, the remain in the 'Kill List.' The government response is currently limited to criminal prosecution and facility-based rehabilitation. These are clearly inadequate,\" Hontiveros said. \nHontiveros also pushed for a \"rules-based and modern drug law enforcement strategy\" to complement a public health approach to the drug problem. This strategy should focus on organized drug syndicates with big drug operations. \n\"The government must bring the campaign to the drug lords and not to the poor. We must focus on crimes associated with big drug operations, such as money laundering and extortion,\" Hontiveros said as she also campaigned for the strengthening of border controls and the heightening of operations against international drug trafficking.
