It's unclear whether Prince William, Prince Harry, or Kate Middleton will be in attendance during this, but the Duchess of Cambridge already has a good reason to skip out.\nBuzzfeed just posted a reminder that in 2012, then-presidential hopeful Donald Trump had this to say when topless photos of KMidd, snapped by paparazzi while she was sunbathing on a private vacation, were going around:\nView photos\nPhoto credit: Twitter More To answer Trump's question, six people who were accused of profiting off those photos reportedly went on trial earlier this month . If convicted, they face jail time and a hefty fine.\nBut should Trump have any other question on this, the commenters in 2012 helped him out:\n. @realDonaldTrump Basically any decent human being.\n- Guy Endore-Kaiser (@GuyEndoreKaiser) September 17, 2012 @realDonaldTrump Oh I don't know, someone that has morals.
