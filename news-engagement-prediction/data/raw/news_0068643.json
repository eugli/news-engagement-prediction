If you've ever been fortunate enough to hear her pick up a horn, or sing a ballad or unveil an original song, you know that she practically exudes music. Which instrument she happens to be playing or whether she's singing, or conducting or riffing behind someone else seems almost beside the point.\nBut perhaps her greatest skill — or at least the one that means the most to her — is her knack for writing songs in which lyric, melody, rhythm and harmony converge with apparent seamlessness. A couple of years ago, she made a profound impression at a Billie Holiday centennial concert performing a signature tune of hers, \"Promise Me the Moon.\" The piece proved so beautifully constructed that a casual listener might have assumed it was a well-established jazz standard.\nAnd her \"Joyful Season\" album of 2013 showed that it's still possible to create fresh, surprising holiday songs even at this late date. Tanner tunes such as the melodically inspired \"You're My Gift Forever\" and the bluesy \"Wintery Sort of Feeling\" elegantly sidestepped musical cliche.\nMOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR\nNow, though, Tanner has created the most artistically ambitious project of her career, \"Words & Music,\" a two-CD set that she'll release on Monday evening, when she brings its repertoire — plus its cast of 12 singers, string quartet and jazz band — to City Winery. In effect, Tanner and friends will perform much of the double-album live, her music sung by such widely admired Chicagoans as Tammy McCann, Paul Marinaro and Typhanie Monique.\nThat's a lot of talent on one stage for one evening, but the eloquence of \"Words & Music\" suggests that the songs may steal the spotlight.\n\"I just really have always wanted to have other people perform my music, but I never knew how to do that,\" says Tanner, who began conceiving the \"Words & Music\" project two years ago.\n\"Any composer dreams of other voices, other musicians interpreting their music. So I started approaching singers I knew. I knew their voices.\"\nThe album establishes as much, Tanner having matched each singer with a new or previously composed original she felt suited the sound and style of each artist. Marinaro, for instance, unspools slyly swung phrases in Tanner's \"Vegas\" and reaffirms his ability to get to the subtext of a ballad in her \"Remembering\" (penned for the album.) McCann rides a subtle Afro-Caribbean pulse in \"Reflections in Mirrors\" and summons profound depth of feeling in the ballad \"It's Never Too Late\" (for which McCann co-wrote lyrics with Tanner).\n\"'Vegas' I already had written for a TV project but had never released,\" explains Tanner, who thought \"that's a great vibe for Paul.\"\nIndeed, no major singer has influenced Marinaro more than the man who epitomized Las Vegas chic, Frank Sinatra. The tune tangentially evokes \"Luck Be a Lady,\" a Frank Loesser classic that Sinatra recorded definitively, but Marinaro brings a darkly personal view to Tanner's piece and to the nocturnal edge of Sin City.\n\"Tammy took 'Reflections in Mirrors' — a fast waltz I wrote — and had the idea for that really cool Afro-Cuban vibe,\" Tanner says.\n\"And Typhanie did 'You Can Kiss Me Into Anything' — it was a rhumba, and she turned it into this slow, sexy swing thing.\"\nMonique's performance surely brings palpable sensuality to the song without overselling it. On the contrary, it's the subtlety of what Monique does with the song that piques interest.\nAdd to this the contributions of Rose Colella in \"That Word\" (\"she's got that light, Blossom Dearie touch,\" says Tanner), Elaine Dame in \"Come Along for the Ride\" (\"a '60s jet-set thing that not a lot of vocalists can pull off\") and many others, and you have a unique album that says a lot about the multifaceted nature of Chicago jazz.\nTanner, who's from Houston, grew up in various American cities, as her father's job with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs kept the family moving. When she got to the Chicago area, she'd found her home, studied for 2&frac12; years at Northeastern Illinois University and plunged into the working life.\nYears in wedding-band engagements and a variety of day jobs led her to decide she needed to focus on her own music, which she began doing full-time about a decade ago.\nMusic in Chicago has been the richer for it.\nWhen Tanner began working on her \"Words & Music\" epic, she knew she was taking on a lot.\nWhile Tanner was overseeing the recording, along with musical director Dan Murphy and engineer Matt Feddermann, several singers said to her, \"You know, we're not used to singing songs with the composer across from us,\" Tanner recalls.\n\"And I'm like, 'I'm not Harold Arlen. I am alive!'\"\nSo is every track on \"Words & Music,\" a project that should do a great deal toward letting listeners know that a gifted songwriter plays our clubs and concert halls practically every week of the year.\nHoward Reich is a Tribune critic.\nhreich@chicagotribune.com\nTwitter @howardreich\nWhen : 7:30 p.m. Monday\nWhere : City Winery, 1200 W.
