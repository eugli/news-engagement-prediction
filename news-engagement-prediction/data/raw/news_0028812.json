Photo: Daniel Munoz \nIn a statement issued on Tuesday, the ABC noted that the unit would also employ \"interns drawn from RMIT journalism students and alumni\". \nMr Skelton insisted it would be completely \"unfair\" to interpret that as a sign the university would be staffing the unit with unpaid, inexperienced workers. \"Why would they do that? We'll have three experienced researchers.\" Advertisement \nHe said these positions, which are yet to be advertised, could be filled by \"experienced journalists, mathematicians or corporate lawyers\" among others. Any work done by students will not be for publication without further vetting by the paid fact checkers. \nIt is expected fact checking will become an integral part of the journalism program at RMIT, and ultimately students from other faculties may be able to take fact checking as a subject. \nThe unit will be housed in RMIT's media precinct, part of the New Academic Street project currently under construction. The precinct is expected to be finished by mid-year. \nABC director of news Gaven Morris announced the imminent closure of the Fact Check unit in May 2016, following a reduction in tied funding to the ABC's news division in the federal budget from $20 million a year to $13.5 million. \nAt that time, the unit had eight employees, including three fact checkers. At its peak, it had six fact checkers. It also employed interns. \nThe ABC initially held discussions with Melbourne University about the possibility of relocating the unit to its campus, but those discussions fell over around August last year. RMIT then stepped in with its offer in September. \nThe need for an independent fact checker has arguably never been greater, with claims of \"alternative facts\" and \"fake news\" being bandied about whenever a public figure – and especially a politician – is confronted with information they don't like. \nSuch disputed territory will be the main focus of the unit, says Mr Skelton. \"The brief is anybody or any organisation – quite often politicians and ministers – who effect the direction or shape of public policy. We're not about 'gotcha', trying to trip people up. We're really going after the issues that we think matter to Australia. \n\"I've always thought fact checking was tremendously important in terms of developing well-thought through public policy,\" he says. \nDespite its presence in the media and communications faculty at RMIT, the unit will not be focusing on the media per se. \n\"It would take a lot more resources if you wanted to go around every news site pinging fake news,\" says Mr Skelton. \"The ABC has Media Watch , so we've left the media to them. Otherwise you could spend all day doing shock jocks and never get to anything that really matters.\" \nKarl Quinn is on facebook at karlquinnjournalist and on twitter @karlkwin", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T13:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T08:30:30.937+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
