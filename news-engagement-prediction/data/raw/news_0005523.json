Source: Supplied \nWhile Wade is racing the clock to be fit for the first Test — let alone the warm-up game against India A in a fortnight, starting February 16 — he remains confident. \n“It’s not a major injury but with the short turnaround between matches and the four-and-a-half hour journey by bus to Hamilton for the next match, it’s been decided it’s best for me to go home and get some treatment in Melbourne,” Wade said. \n“With Dubai and then India I’d say I’d definitely be right for that. \n“I’ll get that bit of treatment in Melbourne and we’re hopeful it’ll be fine by Sunday or Monday and I can be on a flight to Dubai and start training pretty much as soon as I hit the ground there.” \nAdded team doctor John Orchard: “We are hopeful this injury will settle down relatively quickly and that he will be able to participate in (the Indian) tour without any issues. \nIn that best-case scenario, Wade would join members of the 16-man squad who are already bunkered down in an attempt to acclimatise to the subcontinental conditions. \nBut should he continue to struggle, NSW gloveman Peter Nevill would be a strong favourite to earn a recall — having been dumped from the Test team after the Hobart horror show. \nWade will not be replaced in the Australian squad, with Peter Handscomb set to take the gloves again in the second and third ODIs.
