Moms Building Bridges will hold a walk Feb. 24 in which participants will form a \"human chain\" around the Islamic Center of Naperville to demonstrate support for Muslims in the community and promote the acceptance of diversity. (Islamic Center of Naperville) Privacy Policy \nMoms Building Bridges, the Naperville group dedicated to breaking down racial and religious barriers and promoting the acceptance of diversity, is planning a peace walk Feb. 24 that will create a \"human chain of peace\" around the Islamic Center of Naperville. \nThe Community Unity Circle of Peace Walk will start at 1 p.m. at the center, 2844 Ogden Ave., with the chain being formed to coincide with prayers being conducted inside the center. Afterward, participants will be invited inside for a \"meet and greet\" event with center members, according to the organization's Facebook page, www.facebook.com/MomsBuildingBridges . \nKathy McBane, founder and managing director of the Moms group, said the event is a follow-up to its inaugural walk, held Dec. 11 in the wake of Donald Trump being elected president. \n\"That was a post-election, pre-holiday walk that we organized as there was a lot of fear and uncertainty following what happened, and we felt at that point we needed a grass-roots effort for people to come together and support each other,\" McBane said. \"We had perhaps 100 to 150 people and the weather then probably kept more people away.\" \nThis walk is nonpartisan, nondenominational and is intended to support \"all interfaith and multi-cultural groups,\" McBane said. \n\"We're partnering with the Islamic Center of Naperville as a number of our members go there,\" she said. \"We know there is a lot still weighing on people's minds and we wanted to have something here on a local level that can build a kind of cohesiveness. We know our strength is largely derived from our diversity.\" \nThose attending the walk are urged to bring \"signs of peace and unity,\" McBane said, including \"tokens of friendship, like cards and flowers, friendship bracelets and posters proclaiming peace.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:49:38.540+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
