The Chilean’s disappointing form has led to him being left on the bench for City’s last three games but Guardiola retains faith in the 33-year-old former Barcelona player.\n“My opinion of Claudio remains the same. He’s a top player, a top goalkeeper. He’s one of the best in the world. His long career speaks for itself,” said Guardiola. “Football, of course, here is more particular, more crosses, more special things, but, of course, he is a top, top goalkeeper. For me, there’s no doubt about that.”\nGuardiola also denied having any regrets over his decisions to bring in Bravo, which was based on his superior footwork, or to allow Hart to join Torino on loan. He said: “The decision I take is based on what I see, why one player is not here and another is. That’s why I am here.”\nDespite his backing for Bravo, Guardiola revealed he had not yet decided whether he should return for Monday’s trip to Bournemouth. His replacement, Willy Caballero, has conceded just one goal in the three successive appearances.\n“I don’t know,” said Guardiola when asked which goalkeeper would play at the Vitality Stadium. “I will decide the day of the game.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T18:46:06.860+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
