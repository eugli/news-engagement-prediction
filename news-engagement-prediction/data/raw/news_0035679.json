Rhinos are not the only problem, we’ve seen a 300% increase in elephant poaching. We should be looking at solving this problem of organised crime,” says Allison Thomson, of Outraged SA Citizens Against Rhino Poaching. \nThomson says that the new draft regulations fail to make it clear if “it’s two rhinos per person per day, two per week or two in a lifetime. There is not enough detail to dissect this document.” \nIn 2016 the DEA challenged the lifting of a domestic moratorium on the trade of rhino horn, which was upheld. With the rhino horn trade moratorium effectively \"lifted on a technicality related to incorrect government procedures\". \nMedical tourism surge \nThe department at the time, concerned that domestically-sold horn would leak out into the international market, had attempted to prevent the lifting but the court rejected the government's appeal against the judgement finding, while a ban may be prudent, the government had \"failed to follow its own procedures for soliciting public comment\". \nSEE: #ShockWildlifeTruths: Government tight-lipped on rhino poaching stats \nFollowing the lifting of the ban, WidlAid raised concerns around the matter saying the moratorium needed to be reinstated immediately as there had been persistent reports that \"prominent private rhino owners who contested the moratorium hope to attract East Asian citizens to South Africa to consume rhino horn in-country as a form of medical tourism.\" \nThe draft amendments, published for comment can be accessed here , with the deadline for comment closing on March 8. \nWhat to read next on Traveller24 :", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T11:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:59:35.595+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
