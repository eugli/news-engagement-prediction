My graceless response is that I would rather lick the road. Until last weekend; the difference being that I was in Sydney at the same time as the Sevens. The final day was sold out so the offer of tickets was like winning Lotto. \nWow. It was a sensational day of human connection with hitherto strangers who were suddenly a crew. I headed away with little voice, stinging hands, promises to keep in touch, and a huge question mark as to how Wellington managed to screw up such a gimme event. \nThe matches are fast, athletic, and often between uneven sides so there are heaps of underdog teams to root for. Fans just want to have fun, to escape from the scary world, to be friendly and to cheer for PNG or any other team that hasn't got a chance. \nAnd the Sydney Sevens weren't flashy. No Lady Gaga allegedly jumping from the roof of the stadium. Cirque de Soleil didn't perform, as happened at the Las Vegas Sevens. It was simply a well-executed operation that covered all the bases. Ad Feedback \nFor starters, alcohol wasn't an issue. There was none, not at the stadium nor in 11 neighbouring zones. More than a 100 punters were ejected from the 2016 debut Sydney Sevens for urinating in private gardens, for ripping the heads off letterboxes, and other acts of vandalism and poor form. A cause and effect conclusion was drawn. No alcohol from now on. \nThere wasn't handwringing by authorities over limiting liquor, pushing low alcohol beer, or providing more treats for kids to offset adults being twats. \nNo-one called the coppers and stadium neighbours the fun police, wowsers or the irritatingly dismissive term of PC-gone-mad. \nThe crowds still rolled in this year. It felt like there was crowd relief that there was no liquor to think about. \nThe music. Wellington had live bands which were patently chosen by a swinging vicar type. The line-up wasn't hip, wasn't groovy, it wasn't now, it wasn't back then. \nAnd live bands don't work in large outdoor venues unless you have a massive sound desk, multiple engineers, and rehearsals. Yes, when the music is the main attraction. When it's a side bar live the sound quality is usually woeful. \nIn Sydney masterful DJs with a finely tuned sense of moment made the recorded music a big component. There were clips to complement all swoops and rises of the games and the tracks were all familiar with song lyrics on screens just in case. \nThe price. The cost for last month's Wellington Sevens was cheeky and counterproductive. After losing fans therefore money in 2016 it's fair to expect a big price reduction. It would have been recouped by more punters turning up and buying over-priced food. The cheapest adult two-day ticket was $137. In Dubai the price was $187 for three days. In London, $70 for the whole weekend, and in Sydney $72 for the cheapest adult two-day pass. \nFinally the location. You will be on the edge of your seat for the closing comment from someone with a day's live rugby sevens experience. \nLike a big chook I am going to hide behind the words of my late father who said of Wellington, it's the armpit of the nation. \nHe loved the sevens and would enjoy them any time, anywhere, so long as it wasn't there. - Sunday Star Times", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:20:05.482+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
