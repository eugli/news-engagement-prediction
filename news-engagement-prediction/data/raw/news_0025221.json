A dedicated focus on the electric drive in the US and Canada provides a logical step to support a sustainable, zero emissions future,” Exler said. \nWith the ICE models dropped, Smart will sell “Electric Drive” versions of its Fortwo and Fortwo convertible in the US and Canada. This is only for North America and other markets are unaffected. In this era of cheap oil, small cars have been struggling against bigger ones and SUVs in the traditionally big-car loving continent. \nIn any case, the US isn’t a large market for the Smart brand. Mercedes-Benz USA sold 6,211 units of the city cars last year, down 16% from 2015 figures. That’s a fraction of Smart’s global sales of 144,479 in 2016. \nGALLERY: Smart fortwo electric drive GALLERY: Smart fortwo cabrio electric drive Related Cars for Sale on RM 95,000 Danny Tan loves driving as much as he loves a certain herbal meat soup, and sweet engine music as much as drum beats.
