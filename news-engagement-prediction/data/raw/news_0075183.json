Jamie McMurray is involved once again, turning the car of Chase Elliott into Michael McDowell, causing a gigantic pile-up on Daytona International Speedway. \nEven the commentators have started calling it a wreckfest. Three-quarters of the 40-car field have been involved in a crash at this point. Advertisement Advertisement \nHoly crap, guys. Chill out. McMurray won’t be causing any more trouble with aggressive moves, however, as he’s retired to the garage. Brad Keselowski is also out of the race following this incident. \nCounting the two frustrating stage breaks, this is the sixth caution period of the day. \nUPDATE : Here’s another crash that happened shortly afterwards with 51 laps to go, with Joey Gase sliding into the grass. Can’t we have a nice break of clean racing? \nOnly five drivers (out of 40! ) have not been involved in wrecks so far: Aric Almirola, Ty Dillon, Kasey Kahne, AJ Allmendinger, and Michael Waltrip.
