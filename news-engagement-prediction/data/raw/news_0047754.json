It was not immediately clear whether the dismissed players, siblings 18 year-old Dorsa Derakhshani and 15 year-old Borna Derakhashani, would face legal prosecution back home in Iran. Rouhani clashes with Iran's morality police over undercover hijab agents Iran forbids athletes from competing against Israelis in sporting events, often players will feign illness or injury to avoid matches.

Photos she says were faked. Multiple players have decided to boycott the Women's World Chess Championship 2017 which is set to be held in Tehran due to Islamic dress codes, women's rights issues and risks to certain foreign nationals in the country.Morality police in Iran usually detain women on the street for wearing bright clothes, a loose hijab or make-up, and men for \"unacceptable\" hair and clothing styles. They have sealed off barber shops for giving Western haircuts and cafes in which boys and girls were not observing Islamic law.Rouhani came to office in 2013 mainly on the votes of young people, and he has disagreed with strict Islamic rules. Many young Iranians hoped that his presidency would be accompanied by an easing of cultural restrictions.But hardliners have moved to block any relaxation of the Islamic Republic's social rules, warning of the \"infiltration\" of Western culture. They harshly criticized Rouhani last year for saying the police should enforce the law rather than Islam.In 2014, he said \"you can't send people to heaven by the whip,\" a comment that brought a reaction from the Supreme Leader.
