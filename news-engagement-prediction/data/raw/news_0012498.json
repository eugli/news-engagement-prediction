A majority of the thousands of killings of poor suspects under Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's anti-drug crackdown appear to be \"extrajudicial executions,\" Amnesty International said Wednesday, and may constitute crimes against humanity. AP/Bullit Marquez \nMANILA, Philippines — Sen. Francis Escudero asked the Senate to conduct an inquiry into the report of an international human rights watchdog in connection with extrajudicial killings of drug offenders. \nLast week, Amnesty International (AI) released its report titled “If you are poor you are killed: Extrajudicial Executions in the Philippines’ War on Drugs.\" \nThe senator filed Senate Resolution 282 directing the appropriate Senate committee to investigate the report that drug-related killings appear to have been extrajudicial executions in the government's war on drugs. \nThe findings of the AI report include investigation of 33 alleged incidents of extrajudicial executions in 20 different cities and towns in the National Capital Region, Cebu and Cotabato. \n\"Whereas, the above Report should not be simply set aside and ignored as it raises serious allegations that can undermine the country's reputation as a democratic country that fundamentally recognizes and upholds human rights,\" the resolution read. \nThe AI report found that extrajudicial killings have been perpetrated by state authorities and unknown armed persons who have been offered a payment of P10,000 per kill of an alleged offender. Headlines ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1 \nThe report also alleged the use of unverified drugs \"watch list\" based on hearsay or community rumor. \n\"It is not only a matter of necessity but public accountability as well that AI substantiate and present its evidence before the Senate for public scrutiny to confirm the Report's veracity and to hold, or otherwise clear, the Philippine government of any responsibility or wrongdoing,\" Escudero said. \nSen. Panfilo Lacson, head of the Senate Committee on Public Order and Dangerous Drugs, has also invited AI to the next inquiry into the reported \" tokhang for ransom\" allegedly perpetrated by rogue cops. \nLacson asked the watchdog to present sufficient proof that their allegations against the administration are true. \nMeanwhile, President Rodrigo Duterte called the AI \"naive and so stupid\" following its report that the Philippine National Police acted on instructions from the very top of the government. \n“This Amnesty (International is) so naive and so stupid. Why would we kill people? Ano itong gobyernong ito tagapatay na parang aso? (Is the government a killer like dogs?) There has to be a reason. Find out the reason and find out the truth,\" Duterte said.
