On Friday night, the movie’s director, Jon Favreau, took to Twitter to announce that Gambino will be playing Simba, and James Earl Jones will retain his role as Mufasa. \nFor Donald, this marks just the latest acting gig he’s landed in the past few months following the success of his FX series “Atlanta.” Glover will also be playing a young Lando Calrissian in the upcoming Han Solo movie, dropping next year. \nThere's no word yet as for when the Lion King remake will hit theatres, but when it does you know it's going to do huge numbers & be another great look for Donald. I just can’t wait to be king. #Simba pic.twitter.com/wUYKixMBJI — Jon Favreau (@Jon_Favreau) February 18, 2017 Looking forward to working with this legend. #Mufasa pic.twitter.com/1LszbWrcYT", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T09:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T04:31:40.068+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
