Marie has challenges and we want to help and support her. So please, if anyone has information, just contact the police,” Stuart’s mother, Janet, said in the video. \nMarie Stuart, 38, was five months pregnant when she was last seen by her husband at a bus stop near the Sevenoaks Mall. \nHer husband, Leslie Scott Schellenberg, told media at the time: “She’s been pretty moody…she’s kind of in a bit of a state, and I’m worried that she might just wander aimlessly.” \nAbbotsford Police spokesperson Ian MacDonald said Stuart does not have a history of taking off or going missing. \nStuart is 5’2″ and was last seen wearing a black jacket and yellow toque. \nAnyone with information should call the Abbotsford Police at 604-859-5225 or text APD at 222973. \n\nPolice are searching for Marie Stuart. \n– With files from Amy Judd and Jon Azpiri", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T04:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T01:08:35.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
