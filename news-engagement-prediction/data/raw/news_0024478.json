Shah, a real estate developer, is said to be one of the richest candidates contesting the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections slated to be held on February 21. \nHe will contest opposite Congress heavyweight Pravin Chheda in ward 132 of the Gujarati-dominated eastern suburb of Ghatkopar. A BJP functionary said Shah is well-known among the region’s Jain community. \nIn his affidavit, Shah has declared his family’s movable and immovable assets. \nHe is the managing director of Man Infraconstruction, which has undertaken real estate projects in parts of Mumbai. He also owns three houses in Ghatkopar. His wife, Mansi, has one house in her name in Ghatkopar and another in Thane, the affidavit reveals. \nShah is considered to be close to local MLA and state housing minister Prakash Mehta, who helped him get this ticket. Interestingly, Chheda was a BJPmember earlier, but deflected to the Congress citing differences with Mehta. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T20:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:55:26.608+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
