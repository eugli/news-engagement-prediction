Depeche Mode told Pitchfork through a representative: \"That is a ridiculous statement. Depeche Mode has no ties to Richard Spencer or the alt-right and does not support the alt-right movement.\" \nSpencer hit Twitter himself to clarify, writing , \"I was joking obviously. I'm a lifelong Depeche Mode fan,\" and replying to another user, \"Of course DM isn't connected to me. Are you going to take every joke I crack literally?\" \nSpencer has previously made his love of the band well known. Speaking with THUMP last month about the rise of \"Trumpwave\" and \"fashwave\" —the far-right's appropriation of vaporwave—he named them and New Order as his favorite bands.
