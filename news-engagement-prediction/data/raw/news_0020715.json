Thousands of flights were cancelled and at one point more than 50,000 customers in Massachusetts were without power. \nThe storm was blamed for at least one death in New York City, where a doorman died while shoveling snow. \nNBC Boston predicted that the state capital might see only a few inches of snow next time round but Worcester, Mass., about 45 miles further inland, might get as much as a foot. Winter Storm #Orson Has Been Named. Second Blizzard in Five Days Possible in New England Sunday and Monday.

The average winter snowfall in Worcester, for example, is well over five feet. \nAnd northern Vermont, which is also projected to get a thick blanket on Monday? The average winter there sees close to seven feet of snow. Play ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T18:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T13:58:19.952+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
