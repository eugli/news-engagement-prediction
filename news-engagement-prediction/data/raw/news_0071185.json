TIMELINE OF THE 'KENNEWICK MAN' CONTROVERSY 1996 : Skeleton of ‘Kennewick Man’ discovered in Washington -Independent archaeologist Dr James Chatters examines remains and describes them as ‘Caucasoid’ -Tests revealed the bones are about 8,500 years old -Native Americans attempted to claim the remains, which they call the Ancient One, for reburial 2002 : Oregon courts rule that tribes failed to establish link between themselves and Kennewick Man 2004 : Courts uphold the decision following an appeal 2014 : Smithsonian researcher releases morphology-based findings that suggest skeleton was not of Native American ancestry, and may have been related to the Ainu and Polynesians 2015 : Study published in Nature sequenced the genome of Kennewick Man and found he was more closely related to modern Native Americans than any other living population 2016 : Barack Obama signs bill requiring the ancient bones to be returned to tribes within 90 days 2017 : Bones of the Ancient One laid to rest at undisclosed location as more than 200 members of five Columbia Plateau tribes and bands gather for burial 'We have oral stories that tell of our history on this land, and we knew, at the moment of his discovery, that he was our relation.' However, tribal members waited more than 20 years to be allowed to rebury the bones. Legislation signed by President Obama on December 19 required the skeleton, believed to be about 8,400 years old, to be turned over to the coalition of tribes within 90 days. Representatives of the Umatilla, Yakama, Nez Perce and Colville tribes and the Wanapum Band met at the University of Washington's Burke Museum in Seattle on Friday to claim the remains of Kennewick Man stored there by the Army Corps of Engineers. 'This is a big day and our people have come to witness and honor our ancestor,' said Armand Minthorn, of the Umatilla tribal board. 'We continue to practice our beliefs and laws as our creator has given us since time immemorial.' Kennewick Man was found on the banks of the Columbia River about 20 years ago by two college students during the Water Follies festival. The skeleton is among the oldest and most complete found in North America. Tribes immediately filed claims for the Ancient One, but a federal judge, swayed by an analysis of the shape of Kennewick Man's skull, determined that the skeleton was not Native American and allowed scientists to study the bones. But a scientific study determined the bones likely are those of an ancestor of today's Native Americans. Technology advances allowed a global team, including specialists in ancient DNA analysis at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, to compare DNA from the bones and that of modern-day populations. The Ancient One's DNA was a closer match to modern Native Americans, including the Colvilles, than any other modern peoples.

The skeleton is among the oldest and most complete found in North America WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT KENNEWICK MAN Kennewick Man was about 40 years old at the time of his death, the cause of which remains a mystery. He lived among big-game animals such as deer, pronghorn antelope and bighorn sheep but primarily consumed fish and marine mammals and relied on glacial meltwater in rivers. His wide-bodied frame helped him navigate the steppe-like habitat of his surroundings along the northwest coast of North America where he hunted and fished. His hand, arm and shoulder bones suggest that he was right handed and was adept at flint knapping and throwing spears. It has been 18 years since two men sneaking into the races in Washington stumbled on an ancient skeleton in the shallows of the Columbia River near the city of Kennewick in southern Washington. Kennewick Man survived two major injuries during his life, including six broken ribs from blunt-force trauma to the chest and an adversarial encounter with a spear. The skeleton is stored at the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture in Seattle. The researchers compared DNA extracted from a hand bone ofthe skeleton to that of modern Native American tribes and otherworld populations and concluded the Kennewick man was onlydistantly related to populations other than Native Americans,such as the Ainu of Japan or peoples from Polynesia, rejectingthe earlier hypothesis.
