I need to get out of here.”\nNOT HAPPY: Tziporah takes aim at Kris Smith \nSteve Price has threatened to quit the jungle. Picture: Channel Ten Source: Channel 10 \nPrice is the eldest campmate in the South African jungle and has survived more than three of up to six weeks living on basic food rations and competing in various physical and mental challenges in the hope of winning $100,000 for his chosen charity, Carrie’s Beanies 4 Brain Cancer.\nMaguire was introduced to the show as an intruder two weeks in and immediately ruffled feathers within the established camp.\n“I can handle most situations but I just can’t deal with that sort of immature, look at me, listen to me behaviour,” Price said. “It is just too frustrating for me. I don’t want to spend the next two-and-a-half weeks having to listen to and deal with someone like that.”\nIt was over dinner that the situation reached boiling point with Price serving campmates food.\n“OK, he decides what size food everyone gets,” Maguire quipped before retreating to her camp bed and refusing to engage with Price. “Some people get massive bits and other people get little bits. All good Steve, you are in charge, you’ve got it under control.”\nKeira Maguire has put a number of campmates offside. Picture: Channel Ten Source: Channel 10 \nFormer My Kitchen Rules and Dancing With The Stars contestant Ash Pollard has also struggled to cope with Maguire.\n“Steve is a successful radio host, host in general and businessman and I just think he doesn’t tolerate People like Keira who are ill-informed, juvenile, spoiled and I could keep listing a bunch of adjectives really,” she said.\nMeanwhile, Maguire had a turning point of sorts when she and comedian Nazeem Hussain took on the most difficult Tucker Trial of the season.\nCalled World’s End, the pair had to climb scaffolding erected on the side of a cliff 600 metres above the ground. There, they had to collect stars that represented extra food for the camp.\nMaguire got the most difficult final star in a moment that will undoubtedly be a highlight of the season.\nTrue to form though prior to the trial she said: “What if I die? You’ve got no TV show after I’m gone.”\nCarson Kressley gets told how to survive in the jungle 3:54 Carson Kressley gets told how to survive in the jungle during his safety briefing before entering 'I'm A Celebrity...
