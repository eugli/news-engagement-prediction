Okay, so that's not entirely true. I like smelling like the tropical, coconut-y sunscreens of my childhood. Which is why for years I've worn Estee Lauder Bronze Goddess Eau Fraîche SkinScent religiously between the months of May and September (and occasionally throughout the other months just because I love it so much). The juice literally smells like a day at the beach, albeit a pretty sexy one. And it turns out I'm not the only one. The beach-inspired line of products has amassed a kind of cult following, with fans waiting in anticipation every February to find out what the new collection will entail. It might be because every year the brand adds something new to the line. When I first started wearing fragrance seven years ago (this will be the line's 11th anniversary), the Estee Lauder Bronze Goddess collection subsisted of the SkinScent and maybe a matte bronzing powder . A year or two later they added a sheer, shimmery body oil. Fast-forward to 2017, and this year's Bronze Goddess launches (which hit shelves over the weekend) include a full-fledged makeup collection and line of body products. In addition to the Eau Fraîche SkinScent, the Powder Bronzer, and the Whipped Body Crème (the three classic products), Estée Lauder is also introducing a Salt Scrub for the body, a new Bronze Goddess eau de parfum (a richer, deeper, more intense version of the OG SkinScent), a highlighter using the same technology as their Powder Gelée shadows (which, if I remember correctly, is a re-launch of a product they launched back in 2012-ish), two shades of a new, sheer lip formula for the brand called Lip Glow, as well as a new all-over makeup palette (perfect for vacations), and a face and body oil. Oh, and did I mention the entire line got a makeover? Gone is pink-and-gold packaging, and in its place, a richer, fluted gold metal with turquoise accents. What didn't change, however, was the face of the line. The brand once again tapped model Carolyn Murphy to star in the ad campaigns, looking every bit the part of a bronze goddess. In an exclusive interview with Allure , we chatted with Murphy about the new collection—and challenged her to our beauty speed round. Hannah Choi/*Allure* What’s your favorite product in the Estee Lauder Bronze Goddess collection? \"I love all of the products in the Bronze Goddess collection so it's hard to choose a favorite. For the beach, I have my bronzing powder compact since I'm diligent about sunscreen and a hat to protect my face and this gives perfect sun-kissed look. The lip glow colors are subtle but fun, and a great pop of color with slicked back hair and hoop earrings. I love having the body oil spray and Eau Fraiche fragrance on hand at all times too—it's the perfect, effortless pick-me-up combo to go straight from the beach to lunch.\" What's your favorite place to be a bronzed goddess? \"My favorite place to be a bronze goddess is anywhere by the seaside! There's nothing better than a quiet beach town like Patmos [in Greece] or the coastlines of Europe, which are chic and relaxed.\" What's your best beauty tip? \"Sleep eight hours a night and drink plenty of water.\" What's your greatest beauty regret? \"Not reapplying sunscreen when I surfed a lot in my 20's.\" What's the last product you finished? \"I just finished my [Estée Lauder] Advanced Night Repair Ampoules since it was New York Fashion week—lifesaver!\" What's your top skin concern? \"My top skin concern is glowing skin, but thank goodness for Advanced Night Repair .\" Greatest beauty extravagance? \"My greatest beauty extravagance is vacation and Re-Nutriv products!\" Favorite way to consume 800 calories? \"I don't count calories but if chocolate cake is 800, then totally worth it.\" Favorite way to burn those 800 calories? \"My favorite way to burn off indulgences is to swim laps or surf.\" Yeah, okay, so it's not summer yet but at least we can pretend:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:44:07.348+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
