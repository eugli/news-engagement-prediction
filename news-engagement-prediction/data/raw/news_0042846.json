(NYPD)  19 AM \nShe really wanted to have it her way. \nA heartless crook was caught on video snatching $50 from a 66-year-old man with a walker as he tried to pay for his food at a Bronx Burger King, police said Monday. \nCops are now looking for the fast-fingered fast food fiend, and are asking the public’s help. \nThe victim was standing at the counter of the chain’s E 161st St. restaurant -- located right across the street from Bronx Criminal Court -- at about 4:50 p.m. Friday, cops said. \nThe thief, dressed in a du-rag and a black jacket, holding a cell phone in her left hand, sidles up to him and watches as he un-wads a $50 and drops it on the counter. \nHer right hand darts out and she grabs the bill, then she shoves both her hands in her pockets. He tries to stop her as she walks away, and she pushes him away. \nCops are asking anyone with information to call Crime Stoppers at (800) 577-TIPS.
