Isn’t a snapshot from any number of the massive nationwide protests a more moving and selfless visual of resistance? \nBut for Riya Hamid , a Brooklyn-based poet who hails from Chittagong, Bangladesh, social media visibility is, in fact, a significant way to combat massive misconceptions and stereotypes around her Muslim faith. Growing up dressed by her mother, Hamid began defining her personal style in her teens and challenging cultural double standards, gaining the confidence to become the outspoken Muslim woman she is today. It’s why her posting a striking self-portrait recently isn’t frivolous, but rather, as she explained, an embrace of her cultural identity as a woman of color and a defiant challenge to being made to feel “other.” Joining a robust community of young black and brown women online, Hamid is focused more than ever about controlling the images she sees and the image she disseminates of herself to the world. Her investment in her visual presentation helps articulate a Muslim woman’s varying tastes, interests, passions, and experiences during a time when society so often wants to circumscribe them. \nHere, she tells us how she learned to mix her heritage, grunge music, and a love for thrifting to create her distinct and stunning personal style. Expand Photo: Courtesy of Riya Hamid / @riyahamid \nGrowing Up Conservatively “My mom was a fan of floral and color, borrowing from the aesthetic back home, and very traditional and believed in modesty, so she dressed me as such. My hair was always tied in a ponytail—having it loose was considered to be immodest and attention-grabbing. I was forbidden to show skin or wear jeans that were tight. I didn’t look like the other girls in middle school, and I was bullied relentlessly because of it—whether it was about the hair on my upper lip, my floral frock, the fact that I had coconut oil clinging to my hair, or that I smelled like the biryani my mother cooked for dinner. It was terribly alienating and affected my self-esteem in a way that for a long time seemed irreparable. It was a struggle trying to balance two contrasting identities and trying to find myself among Eurocentric beauty standards. No one I saw on TV or film had black hair, dark skin, or eyes as dark as mine. I hated the way I looked for a long time because of it and constantly felt like I was drowning. Even the actresses I grew up with in Bollywood films were mostly very light-skinned and had Eurocentric features.” \nPressure to Cover Up “For a long time, I was ashamed of having breasts. I went through puberty considerably early and was made to feel very self-conscious about them. Even if I were just wearing a basic T-shirt and your average pair of jeans, I would be told to wear a veil over my chest in case I stirred lust in the eyes of some guy. I remember getting ready for a family picnic once and my mom telling me to do that. When I asked her why, she answered, ‘Because your uncles are going to be there.’ And I was just like, ‘Wait a minute, if I’m a 13-year-old girl and my 40-something-year-old uncles are looking at my chest, isn’t that their fault? Wouldn’t that make them creepy?’ My mother’s beliefs are largely the result of men misconstruing a religion and molding it in a way that benefits them and enforcing the patriarchy for centuries, so I absolve her of fault. But after that, I just started doing my own thing—thinking critically and nursing this newfound freedom to be whoever and however I wanted to be.” Expand Photo: Courtesy of Riya Hamid / @riyahamid \nLearning to Embrace Her Curves “When I was 13, a cousin of mine came from Bangladesh. She was a beautiful, confident, curvy woman. She poured a lot of thought into her outfits and was subject to a lot of gossip in the community because she was too ‘bold’ and confident in how she looked. She was the type of woman that wasn’t afraid of wearing a form-fitting dress despite having wide hips and large breasts. Once, she made me try on these huge poppy earrings that girls in school wore that I could never fathom wearing because of the restrictions of my culture—and I was hooked. I just felt pretty for the first time. That same week, my Barbadian English teacher, Ms. Collymore, walked up to me after class, looked me in the eye, and said, ‘You know you’re beautiful, right?’ I chuckled and said, ‘Yes,’ but I wasn’t 100 percent sure if I believed it yet. It was a process.” Expand Photo: Courtesy of Riya Hamid / @riyahamid \nTeenage Spirit “In middle school, I became really fixated on grunge music. My parents never really introduced me to books or music or art, so I scoured the Internet on my own for things that resonated with me. I remember the first time I heard Nirvana and losing my fucking mind, like, ‘Whoa, someone gets me.’ It sounds cheesy now, but at the time it was profound. I started wearing a lot of black and really started to feel that first sense of comfort, that the way I was dressing had something to say about me.” \nThrifting Her Way to Personal Style “I was able to better solidify my identity and become more comfortable with my own skin in high school. I ventured out of the neighborhood stores and started going thrifting. I’d find these really cool, unique pieces that spoke to me. I started wearing only things that I felt were a reflection of who I was. I was the girl in the hallway wearing a huge hat and winged eyeliner every day. I’d spend an hour and a half just getting ready for school, which in retrospect seems way superfluous, but I suppose I was overcompensating for all of those years of being bullied and feeling like absolute shit all of the time. I attracted a lot of negative attention because of it, but I didn’t care.” Expand Photo: Courtesy of Riya Hamid / @riyahamid \nLetting the Colors In “I’d say my personal style is a lot more relaxed and effortless now. I like to be comfortable, but I also like to stand out. My style is a hybrid of the ’90s and the ’70s—two important decades that produced a wave of great music and films. I’ve embraced my heritage and try to incorporate aspects of it in otherwise Western looks. It’s kind of reclaiming my culture. When I was younger, I used to shy away from really bright colors and pastels because they would accentuate my melanin, something I always felt ashamed of. I’m pretty unafraid to do that now. Shedding all of that internalized hatred for your skin as a person of color is an ongoing effort, but I think it’s going pretty well.” Expand Photo: Courtesy of Riya Hamid / @riyahamid \nTattoos Help Get Her Point Across “I hardly thought about it when I got my first tattoo. I was just one of those impulsive teens who wanted to do new shit. But I did have to hide it from my parents for a whole year. If they were in the same room as me, I’d wear a full-length shirt or just put on a denim jacket over whatever I was wearing. I’m surprised I got away with it for that long. I’ve always felt very strongly about words and poetry. It was one of my first outlets as a kid. I got it from that English teacher, Ms. Collymore. My first few tattoos were lines from my favorite poems at the time. I liked having those words permanently etched onto my skin.” \nA Selfie Speaks a Thousand Words “When I was new to Instagram, I made a conscious effort to refrain from posting photos of myself and would almost exclusively post photos of whatever cool mural I found walking the streets of Bushwick, or something. But Instagram made me realize that there were so many brown and black women out there being unapologetically beautiful. The wonderful thing about social media is you can control, to huge extent, the content that appears on your feed instead of the media dictating what you should see, and my feed was just filled with brown bodies. I realized, ‘Wait, I spent most of my life feeling unattractive because of Eurocentric beauty standards and my struggle with body dysmorphia is still constant and aggressive. I can take all the selfies I fucking want.’ ”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T06:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:09:58.431+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
