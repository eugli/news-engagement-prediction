'He has started writing, he can follow my finger and write his name. 'His concentration was just unbelievable with the pen, I didn't know that this day would ever come. 'You can see the excitement, and he knows that he had done something amazing... he amazes us everyday.' 'It was absolutely fantastic,' his father Rob adds. WHAT IS HYDROCEPHALUS? Hydrocephalus is a build-up of fluid on the brain. The excess fluid can put pressure on the brain and which can damage it. Noah developed congenital hydrocephalus present at birth, caused by the spina bifida he was also diagnosed with. Long-term complications can include learning disabilities, impaired speech, memory problems, short attention span, problems with organisational skills, vision problems such as a squint and visual impairment, and problems with physical co-ordination. The condition can usually be treated using a shunt, a thin tube that's surgically implanted in the brain and drains away the excess fluid. Source: NHS Noah is seen in the Channel 5 documentary getting a cast removed after a major operation on his hips Shelly discovered three months into her pregnancy that her unborn son had a catalogue of health problems. These included spina bifida - a condition which prevents the spine from developing properly - rare chromosome abnormalities and hydrocephalus. Doctors were so convinced Noah wouldn't survive, he was born on March 6th 2012, but he shocked doctors as his brain continued to develop and became almost fully-functioning just a few years later. His parents are certain their son will be able to do whatever he wishes when he is older and hope he can one day have his dream job There is a still a long way to go for Noah, who is seen getting a cast removed from his hips and legs following a major operation on his hips to attempt to align his posture. He will face a lifetime of operations but Noah and his parents remain determined to fulfill his dreams, and seeing him walk is their ultimate goal. Noah's parents are certain their son will be able to live a full and happy life, and perhaps one day have his dream job as a firefighter or a doctor: 'It just proves nothing is impossible, you can achieve whatever you want to in life you just have to be determined to do it.'
