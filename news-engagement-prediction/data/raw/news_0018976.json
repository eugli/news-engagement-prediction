Please someone take away Ted's Netflix before he discovers Borat .” \nDespite her jokes aimed at the senators, Bee admitted, \"I would give my left tit to have either one of you wonderful mansplaining pricks in the White House right now.\" \nShe also pointed out that CNN presented the debate \"as if the past year never happened,\" adding, \"it's like Jeff Zucker looked at his election ratings and said, 'Hey, what if it was election all the time?'\" \n\"We were watching CNN, and not just in an airport bar with the sound off,\" she said, almost praising the network. \"We saw you serve the public interest for almost half a day.\" \nBee noted Trump's recent tweet criticizing department store Nordstrom for their decision to stop carrying his daughter Ivanka's clothing line. \"Nordstrom has not been seized by the National Guard…yet,\" Bee quipped. \nThe host also took aim at the recently appointed head of the education department, Betsy DeVos, calling her “a sentient bag of hairspray fumes,\" and naming the newly confirmed attorney general Jeff Sessions \"the human antidote to the votings rights act.\" \nTaking on president Trump's proposal to cut federal funding to \"sanctuary cities,\" Bee argued that much of the nation's GDP comes from such areas. \"Cutting off funding for sanctuary cities makes about as much sense as McCaulay Culkin’s parents trying to dock his allowance,\" said the host.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T06:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T07:49:42.520+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
