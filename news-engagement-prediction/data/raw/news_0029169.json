At this stage, it seems the 18-year-old Monaco striker can be anything he wants. The latest choice being presented to the French teenage sensation is a simple binary one: Arsenal or Tottenham. According to the Mirror , the north London rivals are both keen to snap up Mbappe after watching him score a hat-trick for Monaco against Metz this weekend. Labelled “the new Thierry Henry”, Arsene Wenger has described Mbappe as having “similar qualities and similar potential” to the Gunners legend, recently admitting that Arsenal are “following” the youngster’s progress. Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino is said to have “joined the chase” for Mbappe and, although there is not a single other detail provided about his interest, it is surely the duty of any Tottenham manager to prevent Arsenal signing the New Thierry Henry. [PREMIER LEAGUE RELEGATION BATTLE – WHO’S GOING DOWN?] A more pressing concern for Wenger right now than the New Henry is probably the Original Alexis Sanchez, who continues to be linked with moves away from the Emirates as his contract negotiations with the club rumble on. The Mirror says Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus are “plotting summer moves” for the Chilean and “believe they have a strong chance of signing the Arsenal striker”. The Italian champions are currently “putting together a huge financial package”, while the Parisians could have that ready by lunchtime with the click of a Sheik’s fingers. Pep Guardiola’s glowing praise of Jack Wilshere is his pre-match press conference for Manchester City’s match against Bournemouth has prompted the Telegraph to giddily suggest that the Catalan coach is planning a move for the on-loan Arsenal midfielder. Describing Wilshere as “special”, Guardiola gushed, “He is going to be back to being one of the best midfield players in England by far. He’s quality, he’s smart and has the quality on the ball.” The Telegraph proceeds to get completely carried away by these comments, even closing its article with the line, “Aguero to Arsenal and Wilshere to City? Stranger things have happened.” Have they? Another highly rated but somehow disappointing young English midfielder, Ross Barkley, is “ready to spark a transfer frenzy”, according to the Star . The tabloid claims the 23-year-old will delay a decision on signing a new contract at Everton, piquing the interest of Tottenham, Chelsea, Arsenal, Man City, Man Utd and “big clubs around Europe”. Think Barkley’s agent might have had a hand in this story. Elsewhere, Borussia Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke has dismissed speculation that Thomas Tuchel could replace Arsene Wenger as Arsenal boss as “completely fictional” ( Sun ), Brazil legend Ronaldinho thinks Gabriel Jesus will take over from Lionel Messi as the world’s greatest player ( Mirror ) and Man Utd will have to pay Monaco another £8.5m the next time Anthony Martial scores for them ( Mirror ). Let’s hope it’s an important goal then – it would be a bit of a letdown if it comes in a routine win against Watford.
