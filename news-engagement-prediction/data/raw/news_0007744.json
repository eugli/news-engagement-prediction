SMITH/EPA/REX/Shutterstock (8137780h) People gather and hold signs during a protest against new immigration policies enacted by US President Donald Trump, near the NFL Super Bowl LI fan zone in Houston, Texas, USA, 29 January 2017. People across the country have been protesting the new policies. A Federal judge in New York issued an emergency stay for parts of Trump's executive order affecting US-bound travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries.

REUTERS/Trish Badger TRISH BADGER / Reuters \nThe U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has deployed commando-style SWAT (special weapons and tactics) teams ahead of the game, officials said, and is collecting and sharing intelligence information with local and regional officials. Security preparations have been more than three years in the making. \n\"There is a large uniform presence, and there's also a large plainclothes presence,\" said FBI Special Agent Shauna Dunlap. \"Maybe you might not recognize us, but we'll be there.\" \nLaw enforcement officials said the concentration of Super Bowl-related events in only two areas, rather than several locations like last year in the San Francisco Bay Area for Super Bowl 50, had made security coordination easier. \nRelated: Super Bowl Glare Fixes Attention on Texas 'Bathroom Bill' \nMetal detectors, bomb-sniffing dogs and myriad other security equipment have been deployed across downtown Houston and 7 miles (11 km) southwest at NRG Stadium, which will host the football game and about 73,000 spectators. \nHotels have beefed up security as well. The Four Seasons, one of Houston's most-expensive hotels, has conducted active-shooter drills and added routine sweeps of plainclothes security throughout the facility. \n\"We are prepared for the game,\" said Chip Fulghum of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. \"There are no known credible threats, but obviously this is a high-profile event.\" \nThere have only been a handful of arrests thus far at pre-game events in the city, most of those for pickpocketing and trademark infringement, said Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo. \n\"We're prepared to handle any eventuality and able to handle anything,\" Acevedo said.
