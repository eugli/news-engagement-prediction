It was the morning of the 1976 FA Cup final and the voice on the other end carried a distinctive West Country burr. It was Mick Channon, one of the key members of the Southampton team McMenemy would send out to face Manchester United at Wembley later in the day.\n“Gafuuuur,” McMenemy says, mimicking Channon. “He wanted to know whether I had seen the bookies’ prices. I said: ‘No, what are they, Michael?’ He said: ‘Six or seven to one.’ He was effing this and effing that. He said: ‘We’re total, so-and-so, underdogs. We haven’t got a cat in hell’s chance.’ And that was how it was. There were two horses in the race and you could get six or seven to one on one of them.”\nThe bookmakers seemed to have pitched it about right. Tommy Docherty’s young United team were on course to finish third in the old First Division while McMenemy’s Saints had come in sixth in the Second Division. United’s fans expected victory; Southampton’s had travelled in hope. It was the club’s first Wembley final. They had never won a major trophy.\nYet on an extraordinary afternoon, amid boiling temperatures and rising levels of tension, McMenemy and his players would produce one of the greatest upsets in English football history. The late Bobby Stokes scored the only goal in the 83rd minute and, to this day, the moment is freeze-framed in the minds of every Saints fan in the 99,115 crowd.\nThe Joy of Six: memorable Manchester United v Southampton matches | Scott Murray Read more \nOn one level the 1976 game provides the back story to Southampton’s meeting with United in Sunday’s EFL Cup final at Wembley. On another it serves up the inspiration. Claude Puel and his Class of 2017 will be the underdogs against José Mourinho and his United team but nothing like as pronounced as it was 41 years ago. McMenemy has gone down in Southampton legend for the victory he masterminded and he would take the club back to Wembley in 1979 for the League Cup final against Brian Clough’s Nottingham Forest, which they lost 3-2.\nThey have been Southampton’s only appearances at a Wembley final until now, because their involvement in the 2003 FA Cup final took place at Cardiff’s Millennium Stadium. They lost 1-0 to Arsenal. The club also contested the FA Cup finals of 1900 and 1902 – at Crystal Palace – losing to Bury and Sheffield United, after a replay, respectively.\nMcMenemy jokes that he could talk all day about 1976 and the memories have been fired by the prospect of another Wembley showpiece with United. He mentions the smallest of details, such as losing the toss for the choice of kits and having to wear yellow and blue, which were the colours that the Queen would wear. “Years later I got an MBE and it was the Queen that presented it to me at Buckingham Palace,” McMenemy says. “She talked football to me. It was probably not the protocol but I said: ‘I don’t know if you remember the last Cup final you were at, ma’am, but it was when my team beat Manchester United .’ She said: ‘Oh, yes. Wonderful day.’ I don’t think she has been since.”\nStokes’s goal ignited the fairytale and McMenemy can still see Jim McCalliog’s beautiful long ball dropping over the attacking midfielder’s left shoulder and him taking on the shot first time, which is what caught out the United goalkeeper, Alex Stepney. It was angled low into the far corner from just outside the penalty area and it sparked both delirium and controversy. United would argue that Stokes was offside.\n“Every year at the PFA Dinner I would see Martin Buchan, the United captain from that day, coming towards me,” McMenemy says. “He wouldn’t stop, he wouldn’t even look and he would say: ‘He was.’ And I’d say: ‘He wasn’t.’ That was all we ever said. Once a year. For years afterwards. It was Buchan who played Bobby onside.”\nShane Long drives superb Southampton past Liverpool into EFL Cup final Read more \nStokes won a Ford Granada for having scored the first goal of the final – a present from the local car plant which has since closed – and he would be presented with it two days later, on the pitch at The Dell before the testimonial game that the club held for Channon against Queens Park Rangers. “Bobby came out to huge, huge roars and he got the keys,” McMenemy says. “But he couldn’t drive. He didn’t have a licence.”\nIt is easy to be nostalgic about an age when footballers were like normal working men and McMenemy emphasises the connection between the club and the community with a story about the post-Wembley celebrations. Stan Kelly, the late chief executive of the Ford plant, was a friend of his and he had asked him for a favour. Kelly knew that his workers would most likely blow out their shift on the day after the final to attend the open-top bus parade in town and he wondered whether McMemeny and the squad could make a detour to the factory on their way back from London – in order to keep the men there. McMenemy obliged.\n“We were all half asleep on the team bus because we’d had a good, late night in The Talk of the Town nightclub in London but I remembered we had to turn off the motorway and go to the factory,” McMenemy says. “‘Turn left, turn left,’ I shouted. We pulled up outside the factory, the driver blasted the horn and everybody came out. Lots and lots of men – their faces dirty from working, working. I got the Cup and I threw it out to them and they passed it round. There were tears coming out and they made little white marks down their dirty faces. Then we headed off to the Dell where the open-top bus was waiting.”\nThe route of the open-top bus ought to have taken 45 minutes. It took four and a half hours. “It was the biggest turnout in the history of Southampton for any event, ever,” McMenemy says. “The final bit at the Guildhall – you would not believe. People were up trees, up lamp-posts.”\nThere was even a naked man standing on top of a car. “He must have lost a bet,” McMenemy says. “He was stood there with his mates – arms aloft, legs wide. He hadn’t got a stitch on. The local paper actually put the picture in, with a handily placed rosette, which was quite long.”\nMcMenemy knew the final had turned in his team’s favour when Docherty substituted the winger, Gordon Hill, on 66 minutes. He had identified Hill as United’s dangerman but Peter Rodrigues, the Southampton captain and right-back, had played him expertly. “Hill’s No11 went up on the board – I think it was the first time that they had used them – and he went everywhere on the field, except near to it,” McMenemy says. “Eventually, the ball went out and the referee, Clive Thomas, said: ‘Off you go.’ Gordon would later tell me that he looked at Tommy Doc and said: ‘That No11? Does it mean me?’ Tommy replied: ‘No. The whole fucking team.’”\nStokes’s goal was the prompt for “the longest seven minutes” of McMenemy’s life but the full-time whistle would confirm what remains the most famous result of Southampton’s history. “The managers did not go up the steps in those days for the presentations,” McMenemy says. “But at the 1979 League Cup final, Cloughie said to me: ‘Come on, then. Up we go.’ And we did. We got to the Italian fella from Fifa, who had presented the trophy, and Cloughie is saying: ‘Well done, young man, you’ve done a wonderful job today, well done.’\n“To his right was the Football League chairman, Alan Hardaker, who was a tough bugger, and he was glowering at us. Hardaker reached down and pulled out two boxes. He handed them to the Italian and he gave them to us. Cloughie is shaking hands. ‘Well done, thanks very much again, nice to see you.’ And he’s carried on along. Hardaker nearly chinned him. We went back down on to the pitch, we stood there and we opened the boxes. They were empty.”\nMcMenemy hopes Puel and Southampton will see winners’ medals this time.\nSouthampton The Observer Manchester United EFL Cup interviews  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T04:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T00:10:57.839+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
