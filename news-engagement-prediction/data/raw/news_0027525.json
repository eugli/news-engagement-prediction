Thunder G Russell Westbrook, Warriors F Kevin Durant (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 6:01 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 6:01 p.m. ET \nWho doesn't love a little Saturday night theater? \nThe Golden State Warriors head to Oklahoma City to face off against Russell Westbrook and the Thunder. \nOf course, the biggest headline heading into this game is KD's return to Oklahoma City, and the type of welcome he'll receive. \nChances are, it won't be pretty. \nIn the pair of meetings between Golden State and OKC already this season, the Warriors are up 2-0. Golden State took home a 122-96 win on Nov. 3, and 121-100 win on Jan. 18. Durant has averaged just a shade under 40 points a game in both of Golden State's wins. \nWestbrook had a triple-double in the January affair and came up just four rebounds short in their November meeting. \nSaturday should show more fireworks in a hostile Chesapeake Arena. Warriors vs. Thunder updates \n— That's not how you spell coward … oh. Oh, oh wait a second. Hope every OKC fan can wear this shirt tonight in KD's return as a warrior #KowarD #KDsucks #Thunderup pic.twitter.com/AAJNeINCZj \n— Russell Westbrook is unsure if he and Kevin Durant will ever bro it up again. \n— Kevin Durant isn't messing around, hiring extra security for his visit to Oklahoma City. \n— Warriors forward Draymond Green is coming off a pretty epic night against the Grizzlies on Friday.
