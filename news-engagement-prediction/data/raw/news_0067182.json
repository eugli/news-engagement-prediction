President Trump's administration has issued new rules that greatly expand its deportation efforts. (Pool) Brian Bennett and Amy Fiscus issued this week by Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly brought President Trump ’s promised crackdown on illegal immigration one step closer to reality. Kelly lifted nearly all restrictions on targeting the 11-million people in the U.S. illegally for deportation. \nHere’s a breakdown of what happened: Who is affected? \nImmigration officers were directed to focus first on deporting convicted criminals or those charged with crimes. But Kelly also freed them to conduct more raids in immigrant communities and detain people who don’t have criminal convictions. \nIn addition to deporting those convicted of crimes, immigration officials will also target : people in the country illegally who have been charged with crimes not yet adjudicated. those who have not been charged but are believed to have committed “acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense.” That would include the 6 million people believed to have entered without passing through an official border crossing. those who receive an improper welfare benefit. those who committed minor infractions such as driving without a license. When does this start? \nImmigration officials can act on their new priorities immediately. \nAmong their first targets could be the more than 940,000 people who already have a final order of removal from an immigration judge and have either refused to leave or were allowed to stay temporarily, often because of the hardship their deportation would cause to family in the U.S. Has the Trump administration already increased deportations?
