News host, who got engaged to fiancé Keven Undergaro in March, took to Instagram and Twitter on Wednesday to share video proof of how her excitement got the best of her ring. \n“ Soo…@tombrady lost his #superbowl51 jersey & I lost my diamond & my voice ..super fandom costs !!! @undergaro was horrified! This video is like 5 seconds of the evidence..I did this hmmm like the entire 4th quarter to get #patriots fans cheering. Oooops!” Menounos, 38, explained in her caption.

News . “I think I learned my lesson, and when I have to be a superfan I’ll just wear it around my neck or something because this is going to be an expensive habit being a big sports fan.” \nIn March, Dousset told PeopleStyle that the ring was custom-created for Menounos, after working with Undergaro for over a month. “We had a limited amount of time and worked together closely to create the perfect ring for Maria,” Dousset shared.
