This was followed by acclaimed romcom Catastrophe . She's since created HBO ’s Divorce , Sarah Jessica Parker’s first series since Sex & The City, Channel 4 dark comedy pilot The Circuit and Motherland, about the trials and traumas of middle-class motherhood. Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney in Catastrophe Credit: Channel 4 \nT he 46-year-old has carved out a niche as the reigning queen of realistic romance – portraying single life, love, sex, marriage and parenting with gritty wit, hard-won wisdom and a wide streak of cynicism. Hers is an unflinchingly honest, unashamedly sweary, uniquely 21st century view of relationships. So here’s the world according to Sharon Horgan… On promiscuity (from Pulling) \n“I think you're easy. But in a good way. Not easy like Abi Titmuss. Easy like Germaine Greer.” On her childhood hero \n“Pope John Paul II. When you grow up in Ireland, the Pope is everything. He rules. I went to see The Pope when I was nine. It was like a f rock festival.” On her dark side \n“Have you ever seen a picture of a murderer and thought: he's actually really good-looking?” On sex scenes \n“I think it’s easier with a friend, once you get the first one out of the way. With friends, you can say ‘My thigh hurts’. Or ‘Could you please move your weight off me?’ Or ‘Do you mind if I get a towel to dry myself off?’” On female role models \n“It’s hard to be a girl today. The images you’re surrounded by – the reality TV-ness, the Kardashian of it. I got my older daughter into Amy Poehler’s Smart Girls , celebrating how great it is to be interested in learning, rather than selfies.” On self-satisfied friends (from Catastrophe) \n“Why does everything have to go right for her? I wish sometimes she’d get arrested for tax fraud or her dad would get caught with child porn, just to knock the smug out of her.” On psychoanalysis \n“We don’t really do therapy in England. We just like to keep it all inside and then die early.” Sharon Horgan in The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret Credit: Channel 4 On food hygiene (from Pulling) \n“Kitchen sex isn’t cool. You’re going to have to have throw that bread board away.” On divorce \n“The much scarier thing, no matter how bad your relationship gets, is the other option. It’s a thin line, but I’d rather be in the s___.” On dream roles \n“What part do I wish I’d had the chance to play? Everything Olivia Colman’s done.” On being a working mother \n“Everyone has moments of going, ‘Why don’t I just be a mum for a while?’ But what do you do with your buzzy brain? You can’t just turn it off.” On cosmetics (from Pulling) \n“You can’t have a man tell you not to wear make-up. Women fought for your right to wear it. You owe it to the Suffragettes to put some foundation on.” On women’s comedy \n“‘Women’s comedy’ has never felt like a thing for me in terms of what I watch, read or write. Something’s either funny or it’s not.” On sexual technique (from Catastrophe) \n“Nobody sixty-nines anymore. You can’t give and receive pleasure at the same time. You’re just going to do them both badly.” On Angel Delight (from Dead Boss) \n“It’s a famous British dessert that’s so good, angels are delighted by it.” On divorce (again) \n\"If it was easy to split up, a lot more people would do it.” On crying \n“I'll cry anywhere because I can do it quite subtly. Walking, that's a good time to have a cry.” On courtship (from Catastrophe) \n“If a normal courtship is a dance, then ours is like a heart attack or a seizure or something.” Horgan with Thomas Haden Church and Sarah Jessica Parker, the stars of her HBO series Divorce Credit: Rex On fear \n“I'm a massive scaredy cat. I'm scared of being in a fast car, I'm scared of being on a rollercoaster, I would never go skiing, I would never do anything that had the possibility of endangering my life in any way. I should get some therapy, really.” On her 20s \n“I had awful relationships with failed skinny rock-star boys and rebellious rich boys that would end and they'd move countries to escape me. Then five years down the line, I'd think: I know! I'll ring them!” On being disliked (from Catastrophe) \n“Not everyone has to like you. You’re not a puppy. You’re an adult person. Honest people who say how they feel when they feel it have people not like them. OK? That’s what I do. I have earned the right to be disliked. I am very happy to have people not like me.” On event TV \n“Any big televised event that starts at the crack of dawn is worth getting up for. I've done it all my life: big boxing matches, royal weddings, elections. Even TV-AM's inaugural episode was enjoyed in pyjamas in my house.” On black comedy \n“I think the best comedy is tragicomic. If you were to look at everything I've done, there is a black streak through it. It's not deliberate, it's just what makes me laugh. And there's a fine tradition of it, especially in Ireland.” On pregnancy (from Catastrophe) \n“I keep getting very horny and very depressed at the exact same moment.” On rough pubs (from Pulling) \n“You have to be drunk. That’s how the magic works. That’s how you turn a toilet into a tiara.” On arguments \n“Volume-wise, I win. I just go loud. And the scary fast walk seems to work. The big thing about arguing is that someone will always walk away. At some point, it’s like: I dismiss you. So it’s how fast you go after them. I come at you, then I come after you.” On humour \n‘I always, always want to make people laugh. In every situation. Even when it's inappropriate.” On the secret of her success \n\"I had nothing, and now I have something, and I managed to cobble together a family and a relationship along the way, but at the heart of it I’m still a mess.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T15:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T10:56:32.798+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
