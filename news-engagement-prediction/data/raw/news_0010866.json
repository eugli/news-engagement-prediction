In it, we see a graphic of just what you would get in every package, along with an individual in a dashing sombrero looking up at the wall in awe. \nInside the (presumably enormous) box would be: • 471,612 wall panels • 313,329 feet (yards?) of barbed wire • 1,886,448 short screws • 3,772,896 long screws • 1 two-sided hex key (which sounds troublingly easy to misplace) \nIf that sounds a little too intimidating, then don’t worry! The Börder Wåll would come with a 5-year guarantee and a 12,000-page instruction manual. \nDer Postillon says it’s available at any IKEA branch, although presumably the President will want one heck of a roof rack to transport it. \nIt’s a pity this incredible deal isn’t actually legitimate! We would all enjoy seeing the President patriotically twisting the hex key into the first screw, presumably while Vice President Pence holds the panel aloft!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T06:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:35:51.531+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
