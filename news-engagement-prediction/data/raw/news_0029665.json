Photo by Christian Gooden, cgooden@post-dispatch \nThe St. Peter Catholic School in St. Charles will close at the end of this school year at the recommendation of the parish pastor and the Archdiocese of St. Louis. \nThe school, founded in 1847 and located at 201 First Capitol Drive, is the fourth school the archdiocese has said it will shut down in the past five months due to declining enrollment and strained finances. The parish was notified last month of the archdiocese's decision. \n“Change is always difficult, and when it touches upon the future of our children and quality Catholic Education, it takes on even greater weight,” wrote St. Peter Pastor Stephen Bauer in St. Peter's Jan. 29 Sunday bulletin. \nNow, the school will merge into the St. Elizabeth-St. Robert Regional School in St. Charles, about 4.5 miles west of St. Peter. The archdiocese has increasingly pursued growing such consolidated, regional schools as a solution to parish-specific schools, which, like St. Peter, often suffer from a reliance on parish funds and a smaller enrollment area. \nSt. Peter students who enroll at St. Elizabeth-St. Robert will receive a $1,000 tuition grant, according to the archdiocese. St. Peter will also cover fees aside from tuition for current students who attend school there next year. \nSt. Peter's enrollment has dropped from 321 students in 2000 to just 109 students this school year. \nThe school, which is two blocks off of the busy, shop-filled Main Street, has had fewer families to draw from for enrollment as the area around it became increasingly commercialized. In addition to the businesses on Main Street, a Schnucks moved in nearby and Lindenwood University has been expanding, said Rich Wikiera, a parent who has been part of the school board. \nSt. Peter already has the smallest parish boundary in the St. Charles Deanery and has had no new housing in more than 60 years, according to research compiled for the recommendation to close the school. Just 11 of its school families live within the parish boundaries. \nThe school is also costly to operate: the school building, which was constructed in 1924, will require $583,000 over the next five years for maintenance. \nMany of the school parents are left feeling bitter by the decision to close the school, Wikiera said. \n“We didn't know we were in that kind of critical point until basically the point of no return, where we couldn't do anything about it,” Wikiera said. \nBauer announced in October that he would recommend that the archdiocese close the school. The school board as a whole was not involved in the decision. That didn't leave much time for parents to try and revamp the school's marketing and recruitment, Wikiera said. \nBauer argued in October that the school has had marketing efforts for years, and still, enrollment has consistently declined. \nIn September, the archdiocese announced the closure of John F. Kennedy Catholic High School in Manchester. In October, it announced the closure of schools at Our Lady of Sorrows school and St. James in South St. Louis, but St. James parents succeeded in mobilizing donations to keep the school open . Our Lady of Sorrows is consolidating with St. Joan of Arc Catholic School to form a new South City Catholic Academy regional school. 3 O'clock Stir e-newsletter 3 O'clock Stir from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch \nShake off your afternoon slump with the offbeat or overlooked news of the day.
