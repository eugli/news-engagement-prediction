To further prove her point, Anna recently posted two photos of herself in the exact same post taken in different lighting. She didn't need a filter to show how much of a difference that makes:\n Lighting. Is. Everything. 99% of pictures you see on social media are taken in the best possible lighting and that ain't no accident üíÅ so when I got into the elevator with the lighting on the right, I zoned in on the cellulite on the back of my arms. Yes, cellulite on your arms is a thing! I've had it since the beginning of my journey and while it's lightened up since then, it's still not totally gone... because I'm human. Seriously, girls, stop thinking you're the only one with cellulite and that it's some kind of disease! Yes, it absolutely can be reduced through healthy diet, exercise and proper water intake, but another component which you can't control is genetics, and just being human. It's not bad to want to reduce the sight of cellulite just like it's not bad to want to lose weight and feel more confident overall, but don't set out to lose weight JUST to have less cellulite. It can be a cherry on top of all the other amazing benefits. If you ask me how to reduce the appearance of cellulite, my answer will be: healthy diet, regular exercise and proper water intake - that's it. I will not suggest creams or wraps or whatever else the current fad is because those are only short term fixes (IF that..) and perpetuate the idea that health/results can be found in a bottle/package. So, do I love the look of my arms on the right? No, but I don't hate it or myself for it, either. And you shouldn't either ‚ù§Ô∏è #fbggirls #realtalk #cellulite www.annavictoria.com/guides\nA post shared by Snapchat: AnnaVictoriaFit (@annavictoria) on Feb 19, 2017 at 12:34pm PST\nThe photo on the left is taken in natural lighting, which is generally considered the most flattering kind. As you can see, Anna's arm looks slim and toned. Meanwhile, in the photo on the right, Anna stands directly beneath an artificial light source, which makes the skin behind her arms look dimply and conceals all that muscle definition.\n\"Lighting. Is. Everything,\" she wrote in her caption, adding that much of the #fitspo you see in your Instagram feed ‚Äî the photos of beautiful people looking more perfect than you ‚Äî are actually deceptive AF since they're almost always taken in the best possible lighting conditions. It's why comparing your reflection to the photos you see can be so deflating.\nAnna goes on to point out that arm cellulite is Very Normal ‚Äî so who cares if bad lighting puts it on display? \"Do I love the look of my arms on the right?\" Anna wrote in her caption, \"No, but I don't hate it or myself for it, either. And you shouldn't either.\"\nWhile no one's asking you to photograph yourself in bad lighting and post it, the least you can do is give yourself a break when photos surface those features you can barely perceive IRL. Lighting, what a bitch!\nGet all the ~FiTsPiRaTiOn~ directly in your feed.
