A history buff with a passion for classic shipping vessels, Azhar, seen here posing with two of his completed projects at his workshop in Kampung Bakap Baru, learnt the art of building model ships on his own \nAlso fondly known as Captain Jack among the locals in Kampung Bakap Baru, Azhar was a fashion design student before he started working in Parkson Ipoh Garden during the late 1980s. \nAlthough intrigued by the subject matter, it wasn’t a topic that was easy to learn, he says. \n“I learnt this art on my own. \n“I always had an interest in making ships since young. However, I only started to read about it in 1997,” he recounted. \n“I was working in the mall and stumbled upon a book titled Illustrated History of Transportation ,” he said, adding that the book detailed how ships were made. \nHe said one particular sentence from the book inspired him to try his hand at building model ships: “ Sailing ships are among the most beautiful things ever made by man. ” \nThe father of three children aged between 15 and 21 knew that his decision to quit his job at the mall was risky but he felt that in the end, it was worth the sacrifice and effort. \nHe proceeded to work with several companies to acquire basic ship-bulding skills. Captain Jack working on the ‘Cheng Ho Ship’ at his workshop. \n“To craft a model ship, I needed to know something about architecture, engineering, working with wood and tailoring,” he explained. \nAzhar was 32 when he built his first ship. It was a small one but it was a struggle at the time, as he didn’t have all of the necessary tools or skills. \n“However, I met a Frenchman here and before he went back to France, he gave me his plans and ships. \n“Then I studied European ship designs and how it influenced Asian ships. \n“This then gave me the courage and confidence to do sculpt classic ships better,” he said. \nRight now, Azhar is one of the few model ship builders in the country. \nWhen MetroPerak met him at his workshop in Kampung Bakap Baru, he was about to complete one of his masterpieces for a customer from Scotland. \nCalled Cheng Ho Ship , he said the ship took four months to build and it was something that he enjoyed doing. Azhar making a miniature cannon for a ship at his workshop \n“Recently, I’ve been reading up on Asian ships and I was impressed by Chinese ships. Most of these ships were given to the Malacca Sultanate during the 14th century. \n“This customer from Scotland wanted the model ship for his restaurant,” he added. \nAzhar believed that it was important to know about the history of the ship that is being built. \n“I want to make sure the ships that I build look good and the details are right,” he said. \nOne particular trait that Azhar possesses was the ability to see 2D images in 3D form. \n“Without this ability, I can’t make beautiful ships. I’m very passionate about this art,” he added. \nAzhar, who has built more than 80 replicas of classic ships, said because of his meticulous nature, he was only able to make three to four ships a year. \n“It is a lengthy process because it takes three to five months to build a ship, depending on its size. Azhar showing the cross-section of a hull of a ship. \n“This excludes two months of preparation where I study about the mechanism and history of the ship,” he said, adding that he would also study the culture of the particular era the ship was from. \nAfter that, he would draw up a plan and a technical drawing of the ship. \n“When I am building the model ship, I will imagine being in that century and get a feel of that era. In that sense, I’m really lucky because I’m able to visualise things,” he said. \nWhen asked what was the toughest ship he has built thus far, Azhar said all his three deck ships were tough do. \nUnlike some model ships that cannot float, Azhar said he can build some using the same engineering techniques used in real ships. \n“To some its production but for me, it’s an art. I want to make sure both the customer and I are satisfied with the finished piece. \n“I’ve been staying in Kampung Bakap Baru for 20 years and people here know me because of my work,” he said. Intricate details on the deck of the ‘Cheng Ho Ship’. \nAzhar said 80% of the models were built using meranti wood and the rest was made with a mixture of several types of wood such as nato wood from the Mora trees and bamboo. \nHe said the sizes of the ship could range from 30cm to 120cm in length, adding that the prices of complete models were between RM6,000 and RM15,000. \nHowever, Azhar is worried that his skills would go to waste as there is no one to continue his work. \n“My wish is to have my own gallery to showcase my ships. By having a gallery, I believe my art can be preserved and inspire more people to make model ships,” he said. \n“I also hope to build a life-size ship in the future. \n“Yes, I am getting old but I always stay positive. We got to keep pushing ourselves to do better. \n“Passion drives you forward,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:57:11.274+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
