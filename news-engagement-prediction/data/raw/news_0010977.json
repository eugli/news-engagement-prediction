You’re gonna take one down, we’re gonna put a hundred back up,” he said .\nSupporters put a Christian flag back on the flagpole during the rally.\n“As a proud American, but No. 1 as a proud Christian, I came today to stand up for the Lord and stand up for our freedom,” Susan Woodruff said .\nThe town hired an attorney and a meeting has been set to figure out the next steps, according to Williams.\nFollow Amber on Twitter \nSend tips to amber@dailycallernewsfoundation.org . \nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
