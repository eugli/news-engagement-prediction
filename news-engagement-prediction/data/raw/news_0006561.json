The flight circled the Calgary International Airport to drop weight before landing safely. \nIn an email Thursday afternoon, Stewart said that just because an emergency was declared does not necessarily mean it is an actual emergency. \n“The declaration does two things: it establishes priority landing and ensures the availability of emergency vehicles if they’re needed.” \nShe also said the passengers will leave for Phoenix on another flight within 90 minutes of landing, which happened at around 12:20 p.m. \nStewart confirmed there were no injuries reported, and said the smoke dissipated shortly after it appeared, which is why they chose to circle to drop weight before landing. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
