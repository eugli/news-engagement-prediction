That’s ridiculous, I should know. All my life my mother has told me it was fashionable at the time.’” \nStewart was so convinced that his wife was wrong, he asked the doctor to examine him. \nHe explained: “I happened to be seeing my doctor the next day for a check-up so while he was ‘down there’ I said, ‘By the way, my wife and I have had a little disagreement, I am circumcised aren’t I?’ He took a closer look and said, ‘Not! I am Jewish and definitely know the difference!’” \nWaving goodbye: Hugh Jackman and Sir Patrick Stewart (So TV/PA) \nRealising how much he has revealed, a rather embarrassed, he added: “Oh no, my grandchildren will be watching this!” \nStewart was on the chat show with Hugh Jackman to promote their new film, Logan. \nThe film marks their last outings as Professor X and Wolverine in the X-Men franchise. Logan - Trailer 2 \nStewart said he was reduced to tears when he watched the film back at a screening and said it was a “perfect and beautiful way” to say goodbye. \nHe said: “Last week we were at a screening in Berlin sitting next to each other and when it got to the very emotional ending and I noticed Hugh wipe away a tear, then I did the same and during the credits he held my hand and I was done, I was weeping and sobbing. \n“While the credits were rolling I realised that if it was the end, there was no more perfect and beautiful way to say, ‘au revoir, goodbye, adios.’ \nGood friends: Sir Ian McKellen and Sir Patrick Stewart (So TV/PA) \n“So I think it is the end for me too. Why would I want to have another go of it after what we have done in this movie?” \nJackman said he’s feeling “fine” about leaving Wolverine behind – but joked he wouldn’t be a fan of Daniel Day Lewis taking over the role.
