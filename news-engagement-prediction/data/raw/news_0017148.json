Palaubsanon (The Freeman) | Updated February 10, 2017 - 12:00am The M/V Christina, which carries 5 million kilos of “waste” allegedly from South Korea, is docked at the Cebu International Port in Cebu City. Joy Torrejos \nCEBU, Philippines - The Bureau of Customs-Cebu has issued a warrant of seizure and detention against five million kilos of “waste” that came from South Korea. \nBOC-Cebu District Collector Elvira Cruz issued the WSD yesterday after determining probable cause. She directed the Enforcement and Security Service to seize and take custody of the shipment. \nVerne Enciso, chief of the Customs Intelligence and Investigation Services, said that after an investigation, it was recommended that a WSD be issued against the shipment for \"intentional misdeclaration.\" \nCruz cited Section 1400 of the Customs Modernization and Tariff Act, which states that when the misdeclaration is intentional or fraudulent, the goods shall be subject to seizure regardless of the amount of the deficiency. \nEnciso said that Cruz wanted the garbage shipment, including those that were already unloaded, be shipped back to its country of origin within the week. \n\"Yun ang gusto mangyari ni Collector Cruz, dapat ibalik na yung shipment pati na yung na unload, na sa South Korea within the week. It is for this reason na hindi na inisyuhan ng WSD yung barko para maibalik na ang basura sa South Korea at the expense of the importer,\" said Enciso. Freeman ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: \nRey Leyson, Port Operations Division chief, said of the five million kilos of trash, around two million kilos or less are still in the vessel's cargo hold. \nM/V Christina departed from Jeju Port in South Korea on December 30, 2016 and arrived at the Port of Cebu last January 20. It started unloading the shipment a few days after. \nThe unloading, though, was put on hold the other day after Cruz issued a stoppage order. \nBOC-Cebu investigated the shipment after Cebu media inquired about the tons of garbage that were dumped at a private lot in Barangay Tingub, Mandaue City. \nPart of the shipment was already unloaded at the warehouse of the consignee, Moving Forward Global Trading Inc., in Barangay Guizo, Mandaue City, which was already padlocked. The vacant lot in Tingub was also closed. \nAn investigation by the office of Environmental Management Bureau-7 Director William Cunado showed that the consignee failed to secure any clearance from EMB Central Office prior to the shipment, which included mostly shredded plastic. \nUnder the Basel Convention on the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes, clearance is needed in the importation of recyclable materials, whether they are hazardous or non-hazardous. \nDepartment of Environment and Natural Resources Administrative Order 2013-22 also bans the importation of solid plastic materials if they are heterogenous or unsorted plastic material. \nEMB-7, though, said that South Korea is not part of the Basel Convention, wherein the signatories are given the privilege to transport waste, subject to limiting conditions. It, however, said that even if South Korea is signatory, the transport of unsorted plastic materials is not allowed. \nEMB-7 recommended the immediate shipping of the shredded materials back to South Korea, including all that were already stored in the consignee's warehouse in Tingub. \nBased on the documents obtained by The FREEMAN, the shipment was classified as \"Yellow\", which means only the documents were examined. The Bill of Lading and the pre-inspection report also stated that it was wood chips and recycled synthetic resin. \n\"These are not prohibited importation kaya it was released two weeks ago, until CENRO's (City Environment and Natural Resources Office) report showed otherwise. Daming mga plastics at mabaho,\" Enciso said. \nThe WSD also stated that during the unloading of the cargo, a strong, pungent smell was noticed emanating from the cargo containers. \nCruz said the bureau would study the possible filing of criminal and administrative complaints against the importer. \nPing Uckung, Cebu Port Authority legal officer, said MV Christina will be pulled out today from its current berth and transferred to an inner anchorage in front of the Cebu International Port in Cebu City.
