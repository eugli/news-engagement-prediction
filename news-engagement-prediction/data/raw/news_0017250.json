Picture: Marc Glekis/Facebook\n“All I can say is we’re aware of the incident, at this stage we haven’t got information that it is a confirmed body but we believe that it was a body,” the spokesman said.\nA NSW Police spokeswoman said Eastern Beaches police were deployed to the beach, but nothing was found.\n“At this stage there’s been no missing persons report, but should that happen we will head back out,” the spokeswoman said.\n”To my knowledge no belongings or anything have been found to suggest there was someone out there.”\nPavilion Beach Front Maroubra cafe owner Deanne Bond told Southern Courier she saw the search unfold.\nmedia_camera A search helicopter looking over rough surf at Maroubra Beach. Picture: Melissa Seiler\n“When I saw the chopper and jet ski guys I thought ‘oh no here we go,’ Ms Bond said.\n“My first thought was that a fisherman might have been swept off the rocks.”\nMaroubra Beach has since been closed due to rough surf conditions, with Randwick City Council lifeguards to be guided by Police as to whether the search will resume if conditions improve.\nIt comes just days after a man’s body was discovered on rocks at the northern end of nearby Coogee Beach on Saturday morning.\nThe body was stumbled upon by young swimmers at the beach who were taking part in the Coogee Grand Carnival day surf carnival.\nThe man was believed to have washed up on the rocks but the cause of his death is still unknown.\nHe was found without any identification or belongings and is believed to be in his 50s.\nEastern Beaches Inspector Aaron Wunderlich said the man was yet to be identified, but his death did not appear to be suspicious.", "external_links": ["http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/chronicle/ap/latest/assets/img/news-plus.svg", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/4a65aa1028e612b630e96a96c0fb8c88?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storymeta/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v2/origin:video_integrator.x4Nm9pOTE6jJjMR373OmaeZ6H-k4LJrd?t_product=video&t_template=../video/player", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Search%20for%20body%20at%20Maroubra%20called%20off&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fsouthern-courier%2Fnews-story%2F4a65aa1028e612b630e96a96c0fb8c88", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/video/vjs/metros/build/player.js", "http://www.homeimprovementpages.com.au/find_local_tradies", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fsouthern-courier%2Fnews-story%2F4a65aa1028e612b630e96a96c0fb8c88", "https://s2.wp.com/_static/??-eJytjcEKAjEMRH/IblgU1z2I31K6wbY0aW1Sl/17C64XD56EgQzDmwysxQR2qS0oELseDeu2nyHKAX4BhsK9WsWBAn9gl1mRFdQj9cozFGBcxeVabDOEWjMoUkm9J+AylcydF/BoF6ywBNHd/+WtZZs2DU6MoK3Ovwe+033qRtfxNM3jfJzOl/gC4F5rlQ==", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-metro/templates/components/header/dist/header.css?m=1484889074h", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/d02aa7b142f4ed1b34e3e00da9494fe7?width=650", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/video/vjs/metros/build/player.css", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/spp-api/v1/template?path=components.header.header&exclude-css=false&exclude-js=false&t_product=DailyTelegraph&t_domain=dailytelegraph.com.au&device-channel=desktop&is_front_page=0&show_idaas_login_placeholder=1&v2=1&is_local_news_section=1", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/fb438288172889a057b3bb37b4742520?width=650", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=135086289853833&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fsouthern-courier%2Fnews-story%2F4a65aa1028e612b630e96a96c0fb8c88&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fsouthern-courier%2Fnews-story%2F4a65aa1028e612b630e96a96c0fb8c88", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent6.video.news.com.au%2Fx4Nm9pOTE6jJjMR373OmaeZ6H-k4LJrd%2Fpromo310778504&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/resource/networksales/exoduscampaigns/campaigns.json?t_product=DailyTelegraph&t_template=s3/networksales-loader/index&td_domain=dailytelegraph.com.au&td_pagetype=articlepage_v2&esi=true&td_channel=desktop&td_section=newslocal/southern-courier", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/4a65aa1028e612b630e96a96c0fb8c88?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storyheader/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/4a65aa1028e612b630e96a96c0fb8c88?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storybody/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/networksales/loader/latest/assets/js/exodus_loader-client.js"], "published": "2017-02-07T18:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T04:47:34.598+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
