Heart and Stroke would like the legislation pass without delay.\nPester power Food industry marketing sets up conflicts in families, said Kelowna, B.C. pediatrician Tom Warshawski, chair of the Childhood Obesity Foundation. \n\"Eventually the kids wear down the parents. It's called pester power. Industry is aware of this and they exploit that and basically create divisions in the family for their own profit,\" Warshawski said in an interview. \nWarshawski said he sees the resulting conflicts play out in his office all the time. \nAds' disruptive effect on families \"When I'm counselling parents and children and youth around weight issues, recommending to the family that they not bring junk food into the house …I've had numerous occasions where children will break down in tears or they'll stomp out of the office and say they won't do this. It does set up conflicts.\" \n\nWarshawski joined Heart and Stroke in calling for legislation to protect kids and support parents as they teach children healthy habits.\nQuebec offers a role model. The group said a 2011 study suggests the province's 1980 ban on commercial advertising to children under 13 was associated with a 13-per-cent reduction in the likelihood of buying fast food, compared with Ontario.\n\nQuebec has the lowest obesity rate in Canada among children aged six to 11 and the highest rate of fruit and vegetable consumption, it said.\nBut across the country,  processed and ultra-processed foods now make up 60 per cent of the average family's food purchases, up from 30 per cent.\nGiven that adolescents are now the major target of marketing, Warshawski said, the group recommends restricting marketing to those under the age of 16, similar to the U.K.'s move. \nWarshawski's main advice to parents is to recognize the degree of threat posed by junk food and drinks and then be assertive about cutting it out from the family's diet. \n\"Based on the habits you learn in childhood and youth, if you're obese by age 40, on average, you will lose six years of life. That's the same impact that smoking a pack of cigarettes a day has. So this is a problem that is serious and needs to be addressed right now.\"\nTo help protect children, the group's suggestions also include:\nLimit their children's screen time. Eat a healthy, balanced diet with a variety of natural and minimally processed foods. Consume fewer processed and pre-packaged foods and sugary drinks. Prepare meals at home as much as possible. Involve children and youth in planning and preparing meals. \nIt also offers suggestions to provincial and municipal governments, schools and school boards, and communities, such as limiting sole-sourced contracts with food and beverage companies. \nThe report is titled \"The kids are not alright: how the food and beverage industry is marketing our children and youth to death.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T08:57:21.241+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
