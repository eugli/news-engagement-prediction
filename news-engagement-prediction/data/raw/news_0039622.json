Trump’s national security adviser, was forced to resign following revelations that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence and White House officials about pre-inauguration phone calls to the Russian ambassador.\nWhile the Coast Guard would not specify the ship’s location, US Representative Joe Courtney, a Connecticut Democrat, said in a statement Wednesday that “a Russian spy ship” was patrolling 30 miles from the US Naval Submarine Base in Groton.\nCourtney said the ship’s presence “underscores that the threats posed by a resurgent Russia are real.”\nAdvertisement\n“While I have total confidence in our Navy’s vigilant, responsible readiness, the White House needs to move past their seeming infatuation with [Vladimir] Putin and treat him like the serious threat to global peace and security that he has been for the last five years,” Courtney said .\nCourtney told The Hartford Courant that officials have been in touch with the Navy about the vessel, and they are “watching it like a hawk.”\n“At this point there’s not a violation of international waters. Unless that happens you aren’t going to see any aggressive push-back,” he told The Courant.\nUS Representative Rosa DeLauro also called news of a “Russian spy ship” sailing along the coast of Connecticut “alarming.”\n“Russia continues to flex its muscle,” she said in a statement. “President Trump has failed to show leadership and condemn Vladimir Putin and his Russian regime.”\nSteve Annear can be reached at steve.annear@globe.com .
