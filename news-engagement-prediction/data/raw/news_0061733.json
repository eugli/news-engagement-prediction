'I'm very inclined to hire on Sundays now, maybe take some family time and spend it with my daughter.' Fair Work Commission president Iain Ross said penalty rates had led employers to restrict trading hours and reduce staff levels. Mr Ross said the cuts now meant small businesses could extend their weekend trading hours and offer better service to customers. Sam Arlene Sam Arlene started a new business at The Rocks in Sydney and works 24 hours a day and seven days a week to get it off the ground Ms Arlene said a cut to Sunday penalty rates would be fantastic news for both her and her fellow owner-operators Sam Arlene started a new business at The Rocks in Sydney and works 24 hours a day and seven days a week to get it off the ground. Ms Arlene said it took a lot of time and energy to run a business successfully and small business owners were being run into the ground. 'The way it currently is is not a recipe for success, it's a recipe for burnouts and fast burnouts,' she said. Ms Arlene said a cut to Sunday penalty rates would be fantastic news for both her and her fellow owner-operators. 'Just having that freedom to have someone come in on the weekend and relieve me,' she said. Ms Arlene said it took a lot of time and energy to run a business successfully and small business owners were being run into the ground Small business owners across Sydney have embraced the penalty cut decision (Small business owner Sam Arlene pictured) 'It would free me, recharge me. 'I might even have time aside to design and plan and put something fresh into the business.' Ms Arlene said people needed work, and a slash in penalty rates would allow small business owners to hire more people. She said this might ignite a spark in employment. 'People need work, one would see reason behind it,' she said. Colin Jacobus Colin Jacobus owns a boutique jewellery store in Sydney and believes the penalty rates were not cut by a big enough percentage. 'By the time you put on super and tax, my shop has to be earning quite a lot to justify Sunday rates,' he said. 'I don't think rates are cut enough. 'Shops are not earning squillions, it's not easy for us.' Mr Jacobus said he understood Tuesday's news to slash Sunday rates for retail workers was not good news for everyone, but he said it was good news for him and people like him. More than 700,000 retail, hospitality and fast-food workers will be affected (stock image) Small business owners across Sydney have embraced the penalty cut decision (stock image) 'It will certainly help a lot of businesses,' he said. While Mr Jacobus said he now had greater freedom to hire people on weekends, he said it would be an even greater help for businesses bigger than his. 'For a business hiring 10 or 15 people, that cumulative sum they would save would be huge,' he said. 'It would mean they could employ more people, which means better service for the business.' He also said it was good news for the worker. 'It means the business can employ more people, increasing overall employment making it better for the people getting the work,' he said. Mr Jacobus said people often overlooked small business owners, but said they deserved a break too. 'We're just the little guys, tiny little guys,' he said. Kayla Kellett, hospitality worker Kayla Kellett is a casual worker at a coffee shop in Sydney Ms Kellett said penalty rates encouraged her to work weekends, but 'if your boss is good to you, you come in and show your support and be good back' The 23-year-old conceded penalty rates might make a big difference to some workers Kayla Kellett is a casual worker at a coffee shop in Sydney. Although she said the slashed penalty rates meant she could earn less money for the same amount of time worked, she understood the reasoning behind it. 'If a small business is earning $2,000 or $3,000 over the weekend, they're often paying their workers the same as what they're earning,' she said. Ms Kellett said penalty rates encouraged her to work weekends, but 'if your boss is good to you, you come in and show your support and be good back'. The 23-year-old conceded penalty rates might make a big difference to some workers. 'If you're a mum and have a lot riding on your weekend pay, I understand it would make a big difference,' she said. What does the cut to penalty rates mean for customers like Elizabeth Wood, (far left), workers like Maggie Kowalka (second left) and business owners like Keith Lewis (second right) and Naji Kazzi (far right) Meanwhile, a Sydney business owner in Australia Square said he was 'not for' the decision saying 'if you can afford to stay open that you should reward the staff'. While co-owners of Square Sandwiches in Sydney's Australia Square, Naji Kazzi, 32, and Keith Lewis, 44, will benefit from the penalty rate cut ruling, they did not support the decision. The shock ruling will see retail, hospitality and fast-food workers have their Sunday penalty rates cut reduced from 200 per cent to 150 for full and part-time retail workers, and dropped to 175 per cent for casuals. 'Most of us started out as workers, so I understand when you give up a Saturday or a Sunday night you want an incentive,' Mr Kazzi told Daily Mail Australia. 'Of course as a business owner it benefits you, but at the same time, you're one business owner, compared to 15 or 30 unhappy staff.' A Sydney business owner Keith Lewis says he is 'not for' the Fair Work Commission decision to cut penalty rates saying 'if you can afford to stay open that you should reward the staff' Fair Work Commission president Iain Ross said penalty rates had led employers to restrict trading hours and reduce staff levels, and the cuts will now mean more services and better trading hours on Sundays and public holidays. But Mr Kazzi said the lack of incentive of a bigger paycheck to encourage staff to want to come into work on the weekend and during holidays was a bigger concern. 'The last thing you want is to force them [staff] to come in â€“ otherwise you're going to have to fire them,' Mr Kazzi said. 'You want them to be happy to come in and make that extra dollar and enjoy the day.' For workers like Maggie Kowalka, 33, the promise of extra money was a huge factor in wanting to work the unsociable hours on weekends and public holidays. 'I'm not happy about it, working on the weekend is lot worse than during the week,' she said of the Fair Work decision. 'There should be something extra [for workers].' However, she did agree with Australian Retailers Association's Russell Zimmerman, who said businesses would now be able to employ more weekend staff. 'It get really busy here, so sharing responsibilities might make the workplace easier.' But Ms Kowalka added the she 'didn't really know' what the future had in store. Ms Kowalka (not pictured) said sharing responsibilities might make it easier to work when its busy Sunday rates for hospitality workers have been reduced from 175 to 150 per cent of standard wage for full and part-time workers, casual employees will remain the same Meanwhile, for customer, Elizabeth Wood, 26, she said while she felt bad for workers who sacrifice their time for the customer and for the employer on Sundays and public holiday, she could see the benefits as a consumer. 'If they're able to use the costs elsewhere, back into the business or hire more people then it could be good for customer service,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'If there were more people working, they'll be able to serve customers like me more efficiently.' What does the cut to penalty rates mean for YOU?

Saturday rates remain the same and the pay cuts will be implemented in July For workers like Maggie Kowalka, 33, (right) the promise of extra money was a huge factor in wanting to work the unsociable hours Australian Council of Trade Unions president Ged Kearney said it was a 'bad day for working Australians' who 'won't be able to survive on a 25 or 30 per cent pay cut' Employment Minister Michaelia Cash said the cuts would help unemployed people find work 'If they're able to use the costs elsewhere, back into the business or hire more people then it could be good for customer service,' Ms Wood (pictured) told Daily Mail Australia Employment Minister Michaelia Cash said the cuts would help unemployed people find work. 'This will have a positive impact on many of the employers who will now be able to open on a Sunday and offer more employment, in particular to those who are unemployed or underemployed,' she said. Australian Council of Trade Unions president Ged Kearney said it was a 'bad day for working Australians' who 'won't be able to survive on a 25 or 30 per cent pay cut.' 'We are on the way to seeing a whole class of working poor in this country,' she said, according to The Sydney Morning Herald . 'We are talking about people who do not earn a fortune. The retail industry made a very healthy operating profit last year. They can afford to pay people decently.' She said that for some workers the cuts would equate to a loss of $6,000 a year. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said workers had been 'kicked in the guts'. 'We are going to do our best to convince the Fair Work Commission not to implement this decision,' he said.
