'(He) posed a threat to the safety of the community, which the control order was meant to ameliorate.' Naizmand was put on the order after he was in 2015 convicted of using his brother's passport to travel to the UAE via Malaysia, after his own was cancelled for security reasons. He fled Australia on the passport in August 2014 but he was intercepted in Dubai after authorities suspected he was headed for Syria. Naizmand used a one finger gesture, a common sign seen in ISIS propaganda, sometimes referred to as 'the one' (Pictured: A militant Islamist fighter waves a flag and gestures) He raised his index finger and waved to supporters after being sentenced to at least three years' jail in the Downing Centre District Court on Thursday The order prohibited him from associating with 18 extremists, watching terrorist propaganda and possessing guns or chemicals. The court heard he had been implicated in an intercepted conversation about a terror plot and is the brother-in-law to Omarjan Azari, who allegedly planned to pick an random member of the public in Sydney and kill them in front of an IS flag. A judge made the order on the basis that he was part of a 'close-knit' group of Sydney Islamic State supporters. Judge Scotting said the three videos watched by Naizmand on his phone became more disturbing over six weeks in January and February, 2016. One of them, which was too graphic to play in court, showed dead men and called them 'martyrs'. 'Go wear an explosive, rise up, blow up, and take pleasure from the destruction and the outcome,' one of the videos said. 'Let us make jihad,' Judge Scotting said a handwritten note found at Naizmand's house proclaimed. Before it was associated with the terror group, the gesture was traditionally used during prayer or sermons and signified the belief in the oneness of God (Pictured: ISIS fighter stands in an Iraqi oil refinery) Naizmand, who was born in Kabul and became a refugee in Pakistan, has been housed in Goulburn's high-risk management correctional centre under onerous conditions. Judge Scotting said the breach was only the second of its kind and that Naizmand had not explained his actions or shown contrition. Naizmand's father was murdered in the family home when he was seven and he was only introduced to religion as a teenager, the court heard. Taking time already served into account, Naizmand will be eligible for parole in February 2019.
