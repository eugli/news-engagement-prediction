Article continues below \nOn top of ticket prices, add all the money it costs to get to games (especially away matches) food and drink inside stadiums, merchandise and many hardcore fans find they’re spending most of their wages on their football club. It’s a huge commitment. \nGiven what’s happened over recent weeks, though, it wouldn’t be a surprise if some Arsenal fans are seriously considering giving up their season tickets next season - especially if Arsene Wenger remains in charge. Article continues below Jamie Carragher sums up Ranieri's sacking with scathing two-word tweet to Leicester \nThe Gunners are capitulating during the second half of the season yet again and many supporters have reached the end of their tether with their beleaguered French manager. \nBut you can guarantee that regardless of whether Wenger stays or goes, fans will feel a renewed sense of optimistic ahead of the start of next season.

Arsenal fans react \nBut what do Arsenal fans think? It's been a tough few weeks for Arsenal fans \nIt’s been a traumatic few weeks for Arsenal supporters. \nThey’ve watched their team fall behind in the race for the Premier League title following defeats against Watford and Chelsea, while last week’s humiliating 5-1 defeat against Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena has left their Champions League dream in tatters. \nWenger’s side responded with a 2-0 win over Sutton United in the FA Cup round on Monday night - but you sense it’ll take more than another FA Cup triumph and top-four finish for Arsene to appease the club’s increasingly frustrated supporters. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
