He then asked Chase Elliott if he had any plans to drive a tank anytime soon. \n“Drive a tank? … I don’t have any plans to drive a tank,” said Elliott, driver of the No. 24 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet that will sit on the pole for this Sunday’s Daytona 500 (live on FOX at 2 p.m. ET). “It might be kind of cool to look inside one, but I can’t say driving a tank would do a whole lot for me. \n“I mean, maybe, I don’t know. We can’t shoot at anything, so no point in driving it.” \nTo which Kyle Larson, another Cup driver who was sitting on stage with Elliott at the time, interjected: “They said they were shooting stuff yesterday.” \nSuddenly, Elliott seemed far more interested. \n“Oh, really? Well, then yeah, let’s go. If we get to shoot something, then yes,” he said, suddenly enthusiastic about the whole deal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:24:11.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
