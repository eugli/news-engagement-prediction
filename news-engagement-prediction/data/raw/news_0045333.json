Letter life matters tease Exercise room \nListen to Life Matters' host Amanda Smith talk to Cassie White about the things she wishes she had known when she was younger. \nYou don't know this right now, but the longer you keep up this lifestyle, the harder it will be to shake. Harder for you than many others as you've inherited the alcoholic gene that runs down both sides of your family tree. \nRight now you tell yourself being fit and healthy isn't something you care about, because you're young and think it doesn't matter. But go a little deeper and you know this feels important to you. \nYou have this 'too-cool-for-school' image you wear like a mask. The thing is, not caring isn't who you are. You are just too scared to try in case you fail. \nIt's true, you weren't a sporty kid in school. You came last in sports carnivals, got picked last for team sports. \nIn high school, you managed to weasel your way out of every HPE class and compulsory sports carnival to save yourself the embarrassment of failing. \nIt is easy to understand why you put up this 'too-cool' front. But want to know something? None of that matters now. \nSo what. Just because you weren't sporty, doesn't mean you're not athletic. \nRight now, 15 years in the future, you still think team sports suck. But now you know there are so many other ways to be fit and healthy. \nYou'll grow to appreciate your body for what it can do – and how it enables you to live the life you do. \nWeight training, yoga, rock-climbing … these are all forms of exercise you love. \nScrew school sports carnivals – you can deadlift more than your bodyweight and hang out upside down. \nYou can work on your feet every day, train hard, teach yoga, be a writer and still have energy left to lead a meaningful life. \nThis might seem totally outrageous right now, as you try to piece together last night, but the profound effects of being fit and healthy will make you want to share it with others. Exercise will become your career. \nYep, wrap your foggy head around that one. \nWhy? Because exercise is fun. Sure some aspects of it still leave you cold, but the myriad benefits you gain from being fit far outweigh the sore muscles and lack of motivation. \nLet's be clear, I'm not just talking about the physical aspect. Much more importantly, exercise is going to give you something positive to focus on when anxiety starts to bury you.
