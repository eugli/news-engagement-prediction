Authorities would not release photos of the graffiti, saying the incident was still under investigation.\nThey described it as being written in black ink, perhaps with a Sharpie pen, and slightly hard to read. One message said, “Jackie shot JFK.” Another message mentioned the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. And another part of the graffiti said, “blood test is a lie” and mentioned leukemia, cancer and HIV, saying “get second opinion.”\n[ World War II Memorial vandalized with spray paint ]\nSgt. Anna Rose, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Park Police, said each of the monuments had similar messages. The size of the message varied from about the palm of an adult’s hand to as large as two feet in spots.\nRose said the incidents likely happened between 9 p.m. and 11 p.m. Saturday night. Authorities said at least one person is believed to be responsible for the graffiti.\nPark Service officials said it often takes several treatments to remove graffiti from the monuments.\nIn 2013, a case was dismissed against a Chinese woman who was accused of tossing green paint on several D.C. landmarks, including the Lincoln Memorial. Jiamei Tian had been charged with defacing property at Washington National Cathedral and other sites.\n[ Case dismissed against woman accused of throwing green paint on D.C. landmarks ]\nShe was ordered to go to St. Elizabeths Hospital, the city’s psychiatric facility.\nMike Litterst, a spokesman with the National Park Service, said getting the green paint off the monuments in those incidents took about a dozen treatments, but he said “hopefully this won’t be quite as bad.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:03:57.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
