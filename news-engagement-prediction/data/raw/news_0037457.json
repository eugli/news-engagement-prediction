The song was released today (Feb. 16) via Interscope Records/Ultra Records. Selena has been sharing short snippets of the song throughout her Instagram stories this week, but the whole single is here at last! \nThe song starts off with a some light guitar riffs as Selena begins to sing. Then, the track picks up as the it heads into the chorus, finally bringing fans to Kygo's signature laid back tropical house rhythm. Selena sings \"Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?/Who's gonna rock you when the sun won't let you sleep?/Who's waking up to drive you home, when you're drunk and all alone?/Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?/It' ain't me.\" \n[Buy \"It Ain't Me\" on iTunes]   \"live\", \"id\" : 4422, \"name\" : \"Hit Nation\", \"description\" : \"All of Today's Biggest Hits\" } } \n\"It Ain't Me\" is a stand-alone track from both artists. It is the first new original song from Kygo since he released his critically acclaimed 2016 debut album Cloud Nine , and his recent single for the 50 Shades Darker soundtrack called \"Cruise.\" \nThe single is also the first for Selena since she released her 2015 No. 1 album Revival , on which the first three singles \"Good For You,\" \"Same Old Love,\" and \"Hands To Myself\" hit No. 1 on the US Top 40 chart, making Selena only the sixth female artist to have at least three songs from one album reach the top spot since the chart launched in 1992 -- 25 years ago. \nAdditionally, it looks as though the pair have already filmed the \"It Ain't Me\" music video.
