Maybe he remembers that time Dahntay Jones bumped him after a playoff game against the Clippers and he went into Draymond freeze face mode for a second. \nAnyway, Draymond came out FIRING at the mouth and throwing Paul Pierce’s old ass under the bus less than a minute into the game. \nPierce’s reaction: \nNo but for real, here was Pierce’s actual reaction like 5 hours after the game was over: \nNot exactly what I would have gone with. I mean I guess the 3-1 jokes will still burn last years Warriors for the rest of their lives, but they are also likely about to have more rings than Pierce had in his whole career while still in their primes. I personally would have called out Draymond for having a peg leg cock or being obsessed with touching other players’ dicks, but that’s just me. \nYou may want to stick to fake emoji tweets, Paul. \n(This tweet belongs in Springfield, MA by the way) \nAnyway back to Draymond. He went after a loose ball last night and oddly enough his leg just happened to kick up at an opposing player again. What are the fucking odds? \nThen Draymond got a T and temporarily lost his damn mind on the sideline. \nAs Steve Kerr rocked the “Shut the fuck up Draymond, I fought Michael Jordan once” face. \nI think we are going to remember Draymond for being a crazy person while also being the engine to this Warriors run. \nOh yeah and the Warriors absolutely washed the Clippers in the 2nd half by scoring FIFTY points in the 3rd quarter behind Kevin Durant getting hot. \nAnd a vintage Steph Curry bukakke of preposterous threes. \nHoly fuck those guys are good. It’s like the Warriors are playing a different sport. Thank God I can watch teams other than the Knicks dumpster fire. \nAnyway after that performance, we deserve for this GIF to get some shine today.
