The release of this video happened right before customer deliveries are about to begin. It didn't need much promotion at this point, did it. But no matter, we would still sit back and enjoy watching the Chiron blast past on a track, and on top of that its in the hands of football superstar Cristiano Ronaldo. So, how powerful is the world's most powerful car? Brace yourself.. it packs 1579 bhp. Just to put that massive power figure in perspective, a regular sedan in India produces about 120 bhp.\nThe Chiron is a replacement of the Bugatti Veyron, which in itself was no slouch. The hypercar comes with a 8.0 litre quad turbo W16 engine, which delivers power to all four wheels. It accelerates to 100kmph in under 2.5 seconds, and is electronically limited to top speed of 420kmph. It has the largest clutch ever to have been fitted to a passenger car. Only 500 units of the Chiron will be manufactured, and can be customised as per the customers' requirements.\nNow, coming on to who's driving it. Cristiano Ronaldo is a bit of motoring enthusiast himself. Well, a big enthusiast in fact, and it is evident in his collection of cars, which includes Bugatti Veyron, Lamborghini Aventador LP 700-4, Audi R8, Aston Martin DB9, Ferrari 599 GTO. And these cars only make up the tip of the iceberg.\nRonaldo's personal garage is apparently featured in this video, along with Le Mans-winning racing driver (and official Bugatti test driver) Andy Wallace. There, that's three things to watch in the video â€“ the car, the footballer and the driving legend.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/4TAIclkNDwk"], "published": "2017-02-27T21:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T16:12:12.159+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
