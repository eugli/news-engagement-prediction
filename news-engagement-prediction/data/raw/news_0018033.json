Gabriel Jesus says even he has been \"surprised\" by how quickly he has settled at Manchester City since arriving at the club in January.\nJesus, 19, has scored three times in two Premier League starts since completing a Â£27 million move from Palmeiras , including both goals in the 2-1 win over Swansea City on Sunday.\nThe Brazil international has also contributed two assists in his three games in a spectacular start that has also seen Sergio Aguero relegated to the substitutes' bench.\nJesus has been working hard to adapt to life in England, including having language lessons, and he says it has been a dream start at City.\n\"Yes, I am very surprised,\" he told the club's official website when asked about his impact. \"Although I work a lot every single day, with everyone's support, in order for that to happen.\n\"I am very happy. Each day I feel that I am adjusting really well, with the support of everyone in the club. The players, they help me every day and that makes me happy, even more because I am able to make a good start in a City shirt.\"\nGabriel Jesus has made an impact since arriving at Manchester City. Fellow Brazilians Fernandinho and Fernando have been taking extra care of the teenager to help him settle into life in Manchester.\nBrazil teammate Fernandinho has also revealed that he helped persuade Jesus to choose City in the summer with some of Europe's leading clubs, including Barcelona, Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester United, linked with the forward.\nThe midfielder said he helped to convince him to choose the Etihad Stadium because he would get a better opportunity to play under City boss Pep Guardiola.\n\"A lot of big teams wanted to sign him, especially Barcelona and Real Madrid. I just told him, 'look, you can take the team sheets of Barcelona and Madrid and see what player of 19 years old plays there in the starting XI,'\" Fernandinho told The Sun .\n\"But you have Pep here at City and he loves to have young players in the team -- to give this opportunity for young players. I said to him, 'you will have the opportunity to play here. Maybe not in the starting XI all the time, but to come on regularly.'\n\"He has already shown he can cope with this pressure -- he's played as a No. 9 in the Brazilian national team. It's one of the most prestigious national teams in the world, one of the most prestigious positions -- so then you know you have something good.\"\nJonathan is ESPN FC's Manchester City correspondent.
