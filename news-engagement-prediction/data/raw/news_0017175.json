It is normal. Sometimes this happens. When you’re on the bench, you have to wait for your opportunity. City survive scare from Swans 1:27 \n“I have to help the team as much as I can in these three months. Afterwards we’ll see what the club wants to do with me.” Guardiola has already held one meeting with Aguero and his agent, which followed the arrival of £27 million ($33.6 million, 31.3 million euros) new recruit Jesus in the January transfer window. \nAsked about the contents of that meeting, Aguero replied: “Things to do with the club, nothing strange. Private things that have to stay inside those walls. \n“In three years my contract is up. That’s why I say I’m happy at the club.” Guardiola has insisted that Jesus and Aguero could partner each other in the same team and the more senior of the two players admitted he has been impressed by what he has seen so far.

It could be a little bit. I am how I am. I have spent a lot of years in Europe playing the same way. \n“Sometimes this happens. When you’re on the bench you have to wait for your opportunity. I have three months to do my best and try to help the team and we’ll see what happens with my future.” Guardiola said he had been pleased by Aguero’s response to being left out of the team. \n“His reaction was perfect. Don’t worry about that,” said the City manager, whose side have climbed to third place in the table. \n“Of course he wants to play and it mustn’t be easy. I understand that. “Sergio remains one of the most important players in our squad and with what we have to do in the next period, he will be so, so important.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T05:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:10:57.691+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
