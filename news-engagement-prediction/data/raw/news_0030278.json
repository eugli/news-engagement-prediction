The Bangalore-based multiple world champion overcame his junior opponent 7-4 in a strong display of potting with finesse.\nAdvani is now the strongest contender for qualifying for the Asian and World Championships in 6-red Snooker in 2017 to represent India.\nResult:\nPankaj Advani defeated Ishpreet Chadha in the final 7-4 (40-7 0-36 55-1 23-37 45-13 40-54 49-6 41-8 6-38 53-14 38-17).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T18:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T04:12:28.698+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
