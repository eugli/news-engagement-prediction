On May 1, 2016, Leicester City, managed by Claudio Ranieri, were crowned Premier League champions. On February 23, 2017, Ranieri was sacked, with Leicester City just one point above the relegation zone. \n\nMost neutral football fans wanted to see Leicester City win the Premier League title last season. And most neutral football fans will be devastated by the news that the man who delivered that dream, the greatest upset in Premier League history, has this week been sacked. \nWe all, you see, want the very best for Claudio Ranieri, one of the mot engaging men in football. His departure feels like yet another blow for a sport that long ago forgot about loyalty. \nMy past life as a sports editor on the London Evening Standard co-incided with the Italian's spell as head coach of Chelsea (September 2000 to May 2004). Despite the pressures and difficulties he was under, he was always unfailingly helpful to our sports team. \nDuring his spell at Stamford Bridge we learned some surprising things about him, not least that for a football manager he is a very cultured man. He loves his art, his antiques and his literature. Things were tricky when he arrived to take over from Gianluca Vialli. The Rome-born former manager of (among others) Napoli, Fiorentina and Atlético Madrid was 48 when he arrived in London and spoke hardly any English. He relied at first on the helpful Chelsea backroom man Gary Staker to translate for him while he took English lessons. Claudio Ranieri in 2003 Credit: Rex Features \nI n his first season, he was known to make lots of formation changes, rotate the players and introduce the odd substitute or three during matches, and he laughed when I asked whether Chelsea's players thought he overdid the meddling with formations. \"I hear what they're saying,\" Ranieri said. \"I ask my English tutor what is this word 'tinkerer'?\" \nRanieri loved living in London and, as the son of a butcher, enjoyed the range of restaurants on offer in the capital. Lebanese and Indian seemed to be his favourites for eating out, as well as the Lincolnshire sausages he would buy from Newark marketplace when he and his wife would go to antique fairs. \nThe Italian spent a lot of his spare time travelling around London on the tube and browsing in antique shops with his wife Dr Rosanna Ranieri. \"When we are together in London we go looking for furniture, glass and porcelain,\" he said in 2002, adding \"at the moment we are looking for furniture from the Fifties, the minimalist style.\" Rosanna Ranieri at her antiques shop in Rome in 2002 Credit: Rex Features \nH is wife, who taught art, ran a shop called Retro In Rome, which sold modern classic designer objects from the Sixties. \nRanieri himself was a big art-lover, especially Monet, Van Gogh and Picasso . He discussed art with our chief football correspondent, Michael Hart, saying: \"Picasso. Yes. Strange, but okay. My wife is the expert, but I like art particularly. I like Van Gogh. We're going soon, I hope, to the Tate Modern.\" The Starry Night by Vincent van Gogh Credit: AP \nO f course, he talked enthusiastically about football, too, and particularly of how much he admired \"the English spirit\" and working with young, unspoilt players, adding \"rebuilding has always been one of my specialities from the time I started with young players at Cagliari.\" \nHe enjoyed trips to see west end musicals and was also a big reader. I used to write a diary called Football Notebook and for one season (2003-2004) I included a weekly item on what footballers read (\"I don't read books,\" said Teddy Sheringham, \"I'm a do-er not a reader\") and when we asked Ranieri in October 2003 what literature he enjoyed, he said that he had three books on the go at that time. Books that Claudio Ranieri was reading while he was Chelsea head coach \n\"I do not have much time for relaxation but when I can, I like to read,\" Ranieri said. \"The books are in Italian because by the time I come home late at the end of the day, I am very tired and it is difficult to learn English. The first book I am reading is by an Italian journalist named Beppe Severgnini. The title is Inglesi and it is all about the English, what makes them tick. The second book is Leadership, by the former Mayor of New York Rudolph Giuliani, and the third book chronicles the life of a priest who had a church in Naples and worked with street children.\" \n\"Three? So, you even rotate your books?\" , our football reporter Ken Dyer joked to the Tinker Man. There was silence, followed by two minutes of uncontrollably joyous laughter from Ranieri, who said: \"Yes, rotating the books. You tell them Claudio even rotates the books.\" \nG ood luck to this most good-natured football manager.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T18:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T14:17:01.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
