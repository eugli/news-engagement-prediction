All phenotypes exist within the black family and white [people] are a genetic defect of blackness.” \nKhogali proceeded to go an extended pseudoscientific rant about the benefits of dark skin, according to The Toronto Sun . “Melanin enables black skin to capture light and hold it in its memory mode which reveals that blackness converts light into knowledge,” she claims at one point. “Melanin directly communicates with cosmic energy.” \n“White [people] are recessive genetic defects. This is factual,” she claimed, nonfactually. \nKhogali made the Facebook post months ago, but her comments resurfaced after she declared Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau “a white supremacist terrorist,” earning her criticism from liberal allies. \n[Image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T00:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T19:54:34.790+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
