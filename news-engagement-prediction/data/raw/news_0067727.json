The field of candidates will be narrowed by March 20 and finalists must submit offers with their proposed costs by March 24. \nREAD MORE: Donald Trump says he will bring down the price of wall on Mexico’s border \nThe president told the Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday that construction will start “very soon” and is “way, way, way ahead of schedule.” \nThe agency’s notice gave no details on where the wall would be built first and how many miles would be covered initially. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly has sought employees’ opinions during border tours of California, Arizona and Texas. \nREAD MORE: Donald Trump sends top aides to Mexico on fence-mending mission \nIt’s unclear how soon Congress would provide funding and how much. The Government Accountability Office estimates a wall would cost on average $6.5 million a mile for a fence to keep out people who try to enter on foot and $1.8 million a mile for vehicle barriers. There are currently 354 miles of pedestrian fencing and 300 miles of vehicle barriers. \nRepublican leaders in Congress have said Trump’s wall would cost between $12 billion and $15 billion. Trump has suggested $12 billion. \nAn internal Homeland Security Department report prepared for Kelly estimates the cost of extending the wall along the entire U.S.-Mexico border at about $21 billion. © 2017 The Canadian Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T00:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T07:23:05.769+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
