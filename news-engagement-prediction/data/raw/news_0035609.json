Get what you need today in this early-morning email. The label on the can shows two players in what appear to be Patriots jerseys luring a falcon into a boat on the Charles River using a football at the end of a fishing string. In the background, the Boston skyline is visible.\nA description of the beer on the side of the can reads, “A soul crushing pale ale that will leave you feeling deflated,” a blatant dig at the Deflategate controversy that dogged the Patriots throughout the season and led to a four-game suspension for quarterback Tom Brady.\nThe description continues, “No G.O.A.T. harmed in the creation of this beer (but we gave it our best shot!).” The acronym is a reference to Brady, who has been called the “Greatest Of All Time,” or “The Goat.”\nAdvertisement\nAt the bottom of the brief explanation, it says “#RogerThat,” a hashtag that’s been widely used on social media as a pot shot at NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who led the charge against the Patriots early in the season about accusations of deflated footballs.\nThe Boston Beer Company and brewers at SweetWater traded barbs leading up to the Super Bowl and even throughout the game.\nEven though the Atlanta beermakers had to swallow their pride and produce the souvenir beers on behalf of the Patriots, the cans disappeared fast.\nLate Wednesday night, SweetWater wrote on Facebook that , “Cans are all gone. Thankfully.”\n“Can’t be certain if there are that many Patriots fans in Atlanta, or if Falcons fans just wanted to pour them down the drain and crush the cans,” SweetWater spokeswoman Tucker Berta Sarkisian said in a statement.\nThe brewery still has the drink on tap at its facility through Saturday.\nSteve Annear can be reached at steve.annear@globe.com .
