Mr Obama argued that protection extended to gender identity.\n'Intimate spaces' During his presidential campaign, Mr Trump said transgender students should be allowed to use whichever bathroom \"they feel is appropriate\".\nBut he reversed his stance after facing Republican criticism.\nOn Wednesday, conservative activists praised Mr Trump's order, saying it protected student rights to privacy.\n\"Our daughters should never be forced to share private, intimate spaces with male classmates, even if those young men are struggling with these issues,\" said Vicki Wilson, a member of Students and Parents for Privacy.\n\"It violates their right to privacy and harms their dignity.\"\nBut the American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten called the move a major setback for transgender rights.\n\"By rescinding these protections, the Trump administration is compromising the safety and security of some of our most vulnerable children,\" she said.\n\"Reversing this guidance tells trans kids that it's OK with the Trump administration and the Department of Education for them to be abused and harassed at school for being trans.\"\n'Privilege to perform' Jackie Evancho told ABC she had not yet had a response from the president to her request for a meeting.\nJackie Evancho sang the national anthem at the swearing-in ceremony in Washington DC But the former America's Got Talent contestant, who also previously sang for Barack Obama, said she did not regret singing at Mr Trump's inauguration in January.\nShe said she had agreed to appear not because of politics, but for \"the honour and privilege\" of performing for her country.\nOther celebrities also criticised the decision on social media, with TV presenter Ellen DeGeneres tweeting: \"This isn't about politics. It's about human rights.\"\n\"My heart is a girl heart\" - Zoey's story Are you a transgender student who is affected by this decision?
