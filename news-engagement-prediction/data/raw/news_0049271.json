By Jamie Feldman \nA picture says a thousand words, but on social media , they don‚Äôt always tell the whole story. \nIt‚Äôs a point Carys Gray just proved on her Instagram account, busybeefitness . Her posts typically show off the results of her booty-focused fitness routine and reflect a body positive outlook , but a recent post that has nothing to do with her workouts really struck a chord with followers.

Promising trials show that relief may be on the way for some, and there are dermatologist-approved remedies and products that help people with eczema cope. Still, there‚Äôs currently no cure . \nThe condition is still ‚Äúa big insecurity‚Äù for Gray, she admits, but she said she‚Äôs ‚Äúlearning to accept myself knowing that everyone has their own struggles and insecurities and that‚Äôs what makes us unique and special.‚Äù \nIndeed.
