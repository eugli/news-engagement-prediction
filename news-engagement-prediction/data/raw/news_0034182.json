(3:38) \nToday, similar trends are leading to similar fears – and the similarly troubling rise of political figures championing nationalist and isolationist sentiments, analysts note on this week’s episode of Insight, ‘Lessons of War’ . \n“The way Hitler rose to power, he appealed to the lower middle classes. They felt that because they had seen a lot of their savings evaporate through hyperinflation, the system wasn’t looking out for them,” said Richard Bitzinger, coordinator of the Military Transformations Programme at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies. \n“I think this is the same thing Trump has done.” \nUnited States President Donald Trump has made several controversial moves since taking office in January, including pulling America out of the Trans Pacific Partnership and carrying out extreme vetting of immigrants – all under a broad nationalistic agenda to put “America First”. \nNationalistic sentiments are resurgent elsewhere as well. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s push to make Russia “great again” has led to military adventurism, such as through Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, noted Mr Bitzinger. \nMeanwhile, China’s increasingly aggressive attempts to assert sovereignty over the South China Sea has led to tensions with its neighbours – and could be a potential flashpoint for a major conflict, Mr Bitzinger warned. \n“Increasingly, you have countries that are governing from a sense of fear and from the perspective of being the loser,” he said. “If everybody feels they are the victim, nobody wants to make concessions.” Members of China's South Sea Fleet (Photo: AFP) \nBut Dr Schupmann noted that while parallels between the present and the pre-war era exist, international institutions like the European Union are now in place and still considered legitimate by citizens around the world – in contrast to the situation pre-1940s. \nThese institutions are important for moderating different nations in dialogue and offering alternate paths for conflict resolution, he added. \nSaid Mr Bitzinger: “We are still dealing today with the same issues we dealt with 20, 30, 50 years ago. \n“It’s how we deal with them, and the kind of people we have in charge of dealing with them, that will determine war or peace.” \nWatch the Insight episode on the lessons of World War II here . - CNA/yv ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T10:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T05:24:30.940+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
