After picking our jaws up off the floor, we got to investigating. Here’s exactly how everyone’s favourite friend achieves the look. Feb 13, 2017 at 10:55pm PST She puts a “skinny” spin on cheat meals. Further affirming the fact that she could be your bestie, Aniston admits that pasta is her guilty pleasure. But when she indulges, it’s with a healthy twist, like veggie lasagna. “You have zucchini, eggplant that acts as a paste, and you layer it with different cheese and put it in the oven,” E! News reported. And when Aniston enjoys hubby Justin Theroux’s irresistible carbonara dish, it’s with one caveat: “We substitute turkey bacon for real bacon.” Her breakfasts are filling and nutrient-rich. A post shared by Living Proof (@livingproofinc) on May 21, 2015 at 9:24am PDT She maintains a balanced diet all year long. “I don’t let eating habits get out of control where I need a reset button,” she told Yahoo! Food . So while the rest of us rebounded from the holidays with Dry January or Whole30 , Aniston’s been living her best (healthy) life the entire time. She makes it sound easy: “Eat as much organic fruits and veggies as you can, keep sugar [intake] low, drink tons and tons of water, and get good sleep.” She mixes up her workouts. \nA post shared by Living Proof (@livingproofinc) on May 21, 2015 at 10:17am PDT We know Aniston’s a hard-core yogi, but she shared with Women’s Health that “variety is key.” She also loves spin, has tried barre method and is a fan of circuit training —15 minutes dedicated to her quads, 15 minutes on the elliptical, 15 minutes of spinning, 15 minutes of running, followed by portions of the Body by Simone DVD for floor work. The one trend she just couldn’t get in to? Boot camp. “I don’t want to get yelled at—at all. Please stop yelling at me,” she laughed to the mag. She practices what she preaches. While some celebs are out there promoting ridiculous products for money, Aniston only reps ones she truly believes in. Those include Smartwater, which has added electrolytes, Aveeno (she’s a fan of their Absolutely Ageless line), and Living Proof hair products to keep her famous locks looking healthy. Her meals are anything but boring. \nA post shared by Living Proof (@livingproofinc) on May 21, 2015 at 2:21pm PDT “Justin and I both love to tinker in the kitchen,” Aniston revealed to Yahoo! Food . So while she calls her lunch basic—salad and some form of protein—her perfect combo isn’t just lettuce and chicken. She loves a grain-based one with bulgur, feta, and garbanzo beans. Her refrigerator staples are super healthy. And they’re already made and prepped. “I always have cut raw vegetables in a Tupperware container,” Aniston shared with Yahoo! Food . She also stocks hard-boiled eggs and pulled chicken on the reg—plus a special treat in the freezer. “I was at a spa one time, and they gave me a little cup of frozen grapes after my mud bath soak or whatever,” she told Women’s Health . Now Aniston makes them herself—she prefers red grapes—for a snack.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T15:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T10:40:53.240+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
