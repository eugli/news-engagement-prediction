I also spoke with Mourinho but there was a person, whose name I will not say, who probably did not like the idea of my return. \n\"Even the fans were enthusiastic and would have been delighted, but because I realised that they [the club] would not do anything I then asked my agent to look for other teams. \n\"Marseille immediately won me over with their project and immediately created a great feeling. We only spent one day to close the deal. They really treated me like a God, making it clear they had a great need for me.\" \nIt's anyone's guess as to who this person was who played a part in Evra not rejoining. \nUnited fans are surely a bit gutted that the fan favourite didn't re-sign for the Red Devils and they won't be able to see him in an United shirt anytime soon. \nBut at least they can still watch Evra having the time of his life on social media. \nHere are his best moments:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T19:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T17:02:48.460+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
