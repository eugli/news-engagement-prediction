The bizarre decision was apparently an attempt by the college principal to curb sexual harassment on its premises. \nAccording to a report in The Times of India , principal Swati Deshpande of the Government Polytechnic College said women who dress like men start thinking like men, causing gender reversals in their heads, which reduces their urge to reproduce. Deshpande is also reported to be keen on introducing a dress code of Indian traditional wear for female students, which according to her, will be more in keeping with their physiological make-up. \n“I have heard theories on why girls suffer from PCODs (Poly Cystic Ovarian Diseases) at an early age. When they dress like men, they start thinking or behaving like them,” Deshpande told TOI . “There is a gender role reversal in their head. Due to this, the natural urge to reproduce diminishes right from a young age and therefore they suffer from problems like PCODs.” \nSocial media users were quick to dispel the notion that PCODs, a common medical condition among women caused by hormonal imbalance, had anything to do with the way women dressed. Thanks to the women who decided to educate the college principal on Twitter, the hashtag #DressLikeAnIndianWoman was born. — Rituparna Chatterjee (@MasalaBai) February 7, 2017 women, let everything you do be a revolution; quiet, loud, in skirts, saris or hijab. how you speak, think, love. we have no time left.
