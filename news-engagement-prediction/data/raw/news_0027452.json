Using Meganucleases, engineered versions of naturally occurring restriction enzymes, the results are precise, efficient, and flexible and less expensive. \nThe scientific panel’s conclusions were also drawn in response to a long-standing taboo in making changes in genes to the human genome over concerns that such alterations would be inherited by future generations and concerns that any tampering could lead to the creation of new diseases, and become part of the human gene pool, according to NPR.

But these therapies affect only the patient. \nScientists in Stockholm are editing DNA to better understand human embryonic development and see what causes infertility or could help women have healthy babies. \nResearchers in London are using the tool to modify mosquitoes that spread malaria and to try and wipe out the gene that kills hundreds of thousands of people every year, most of them children. BREAKING: Editing the DNA of a human embryo to prevent a disease in a baby could be ethically allowable one day. https://t.co/4QfNTTifT7 — ScienceInsider (@ScienceInsider) February 14, 2017 \nThere is caution in the 246-page report Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics and Governance about what would be permissible. \nBasic research genome editing is already underway in early stages of development and trials for clinical applications for non-heritable cells in the US. The therapies affect only the patient and not any offspring because of present US government restrictions prohibiting the use of federal funds in research on human embryos. \nThere is public concern about using genome editing which many see as crossing an “ethically inviolable” line where human traits and capacities such as physical strength could be enhanced. \n“Genome editing to enhance traits or abilities beyond ordinary health raises concerns about whether the benefits can outweigh the risks, and about fairness if available to some people,” Alta Charo, Professor of law and bioethics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison said.
