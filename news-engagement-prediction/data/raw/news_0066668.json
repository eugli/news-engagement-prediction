In one case, a deputy school director was injured when protesters hurled a fire extinguisher. \nThe protesters are angry over the alleged rape of the 22-year-old man during a Feb. 2 arrest in an area north of Paris where large numbers of immigrants live. The man, identified only as Theo, remains in hospital with injuries to his anus and head. \nHe has called for public calm and his family has said they have faith in the French justice system. One of the banners carried at Thursday’s rally read \"Revenge for Theo!\" \n>> Read more: Racism, sex abuse and impunity: French police’s toxic legacy in the suburbs \nSocial media networks showed signs of skirmishes on the fringes of the rally in the Place de la Nation square in the east of Paris, where riot police in protective gear advanced on groups of mostly-hooded youths in sidestreet confrontations. \nA helicopter flew overhead and tear gas clouds rose into the air above that square towards the end of the rally. \nThe Paris police department had warned people to stay away from the protest, saying it was not authorised and that there was a risk of violent groups causing trouble, as happened over the last three weeks. \nFour police officers have been suspended pending an inquiry into the Feb. 2 incident. One has been placed under formal investigation for suspected rape and three others for unnecessary use of force. \nSo far the protests have not snowballed to the extent of the unrest that 12 years ago drew global attention to the stark contrast between wealthy Paris and the suburbs that surround it. \n(REUTERS) ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:50:24.273+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
