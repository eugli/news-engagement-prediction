She went over her time by a couple of seconds, so naturally, the senator shattered a tabletop in retaliation because HOW DARE SHE GO OVER HER TWO MINUTES? \nMake no mistake, he wasn’t pissed the intern took a couple of seconds longer than allowed. He was pissed about what she was saying. Twitter \nAlexa Garcia-Ditta, the NARAL Texas communications director, was watching the scene unfold from the gallery when she tweeted the picture of the broken tabletop. \nHennessy was reportedly urging lawmakers to “stop playing with women’s healthcare as if it’s your own political puppet” (Amen!) when Schwertner literally brought down the gavel (read: hammer) on her testimony, according to Cosmopolitan . Twitter \nThe bill Hennessy and NARAL were testifying against was SB 415. If passed, the bill would limit a doctor’s ability to conduct completely legal and medically safe dilation and evacuation procedures that are frequently used for second-trimester abortions. (NARAL is the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws.) \nHennessy told Cosmopolitan, “I don’t know why he banged [the gavel] so aggressively. He just clearly was rattled by it.” \nSchwertner’s chief of staff reportedly said he was tryng “to run an orderly meeting,” but, like, Hennessy wasn’t yelling. She was just talking. You were the one causing a scene. Why you so mad, bro? \nO . Maybe it’s because of sexism. LOL, I forgot. My b! We said glass *ceiling*, not table. https://t.co/B8lU4gdsxa \n— Cecile Richards (@CecileRichards) February 16, 2017 \nDirectly following Hennessy’s testimony and his temper tantrum, Schwertner — chair of the Texas Senate Health and Human Services Committee — allowed the president of the anti-abortion Texas Alliance for Life lobby group to speak well over his allotted two-minute timeframe. \nAh, yes, because as long as you’re a man and as long as you’re fighting to take away the rights of women, you can speak for as long as you want. \nHypocrisy! Sexism! Patriarchy! Hurting the lives of women everywhere! So fun! \nSchwertner might have succeeded in shutting Hennessy up this time, but just like every woman fighting for women’s rights in Trumps’s America , she will persist.
