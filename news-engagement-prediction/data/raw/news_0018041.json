This is the time I am enjoying most at Man United. \n“When we are on the pitch you can recognise a big team playing. \n“OK, sometimes we don’t win but we are always the protagonist team, we are always getting more chances than the opponent. \n“Almost always we have had more possession than our opponents. Normally the best player of the opposition is the goalkeeper so that shows we are a big team.” \nHerrera is something of a fan favourite and he in turn loves it at Manchester United.
