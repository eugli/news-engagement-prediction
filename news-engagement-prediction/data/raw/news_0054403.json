PUBLISHED: 04:24, Wed, Feb 22, 2017 | UPDATED: 05:10, Wed, Feb 22, 2017 \nIt is claimed the unelected Upper House is packed with “cronies” and is “abused” by politicians in the Lower House. \nThe House of Lords has come under increased scrutiny in recent weeks after several high-profile peers have threatened to amend the Government’s Brexit Bill – a move which could threaten to override the will of the British people to leave the clutches of the EU. GETTY/ PARLIAMENT.UK A petition to replace the House of Lords has reached more than 16,000 signatures The House of Lords is being abused by our elected officials by filling it with cronies \nThe petition, which runs until May 2, has more than 16,000 votes and urges the Government to replace the Lords with a publicly elected body. \nThe petition reads: “The House of Lords is being abused by our elected officials by filling it with cronies. It costs our taxpayers around £100million a year (probably much more). \n“The House of Lords is the largest parliamentary chamber in any democracy. It is surpassed in size only by China’s National People’s Congress.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T11:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T07:18:17.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
