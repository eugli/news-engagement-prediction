Updated 1 February 2017, 14:30 AEDT By Peter Marsh \nRepublicans might need to make an unprecedented move to get Donald Trump's nominee onto the Supreme Court. Things could be about to get awkward for Donald Trump's pick for the Supreme Court. (Credit: Reuters) \nDonald Trump has revealed Neil Gorsuch as his pick for the vacant seat on the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS). \nIn typical Trump style, the President appeared in a splashy prime-time television special to make the announcement. \nBut, as Merrick Garland found out, just being nominated by the president is no guarantee you've got the job. \nMr Garland was nominated by then-president Barack Obama last year to fill the vacancy caused by the sudden death of Justice Antonin Scalia. \nBut thanks to the efforts of congressional Republicans, Mr Garland never even made it to a hearing . \nIt's likely Mr Trump's pick will face similar hurdles . Is this normally how a SCOTUS nomination is announced? \nUh, nope. \nTelevision networks cut into prime-time programming to televise the announcement, and it was reported by CNN that the final two contenders travelled to Washington for the announcement. \nSound familiar? External Link: The reveal of Donald Trump's SCOTUS nominee wasn't too different from announcing the winner of the Miss Universe beauty pageant. What happens now? \nMr Gorsuch is supposed to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee for a hearing , where he'll be peppered with questions about his suitability for the job and his views on a range of constitutional issues. \nOnce the hearings have finished, his nomination faces a vote of the full Senate . \nA simple majority is needed to confirm Mr Gorsuch's appointment, and then he can take his place as a Justice of the Supreme Court. \nBut we're in 2017. This confirmation process is likely to be a long way from normal (or easy). Can Democrats stop the nomination? \nAbsolutely. \nSenior lecturer in American Politics and Foreign Policy at the United States Studies Centre, David Smith, says Democrats can use what is known as a filibuster to stop Mr Gorsuch's nomination from even coming to a vote. \n\"While nominations only require 51 Senate votes to pass, 60 votes are required to break a filibuster, and Republicans only have 52 votes in the Senate,\" he says. \nDemocratic Senator Jeff Merkley has said he will filibuster any pick from Mr Trump that isn't Merrick Garland. \nIf that happens, Mr Smith says Republicans will have to decide if they'll exercise the \"nuclear option\" .

Bernstein) What's the 'nuclear option'? \nEssentially, it means changing the rules of the Senate to allow a Supreme Court nomination to be passed with a simple majority of votes (instead of the 60 that are required if Democrats decide to filibuster the nomination). \nThe trouble is that rule would then apply to every piece of legislation, drastically altering the traditional role of the Senate , according to the Washington Post. \nMr Smith says it's something neither Democrats nor Republicans want to do. \n\"A lot of Democrats are wary of how this could limit their potency in the future, and so may want to allow the nomination through,\" he says. \n\"However, Republicans may also be wary of creating a precedent with the nuclear option that could be used against them the next time they're the minority.\" \nIf you thought the election campaign was brutal, Mr Smith says the process to confirmation for Mr Trump's SCOTUS pick isn't likely to be any less contentious. \n\"In general, this is likely to contribute to the general atmosphere of hyper-partisanship in Washington,\" he says.
