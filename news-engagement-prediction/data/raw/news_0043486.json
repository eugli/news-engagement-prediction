It has since expanded to more than 2,000 restaurants, of which 1,600 are in the United States.\nRestaurant Brands was formed in 2014, when 3G Capital-backed Burger King acquired Canadian coffee and doughnut chain Tim Hortons Inc for US$11 billion.\nReuters reported on Monday that Restaurant Brands was nearing a deal to buy Popeyes, citing people familiar with the matter.\nRestaurant Brands said on Tuesday it would finance the deal with cash on hand and a financing commitment from J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo.\nThe company was advised by Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP. Popeyes received financial advice from UBS and Genesis Capital LLC and legal counsel from King & Spalding LLP.\n(Reporting by John Benny in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel and Sayantani Ghosh)\n- Reuters\nEmail More", "external_links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=#&title=&summary=&source="], "published": "2017-02-22T05:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:27:21.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
