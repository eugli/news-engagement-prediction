They are said to have tried to sign the Brazilian, seen as one of the most exciting prospects in world football, in the summer, but were beaten to his signature by City. \nReports in Italy say that Steven Zhang , the main man in Inter's Chinese ownership, is a big fan of Jesus and they will push to sign him in the summer. \nIf we're being honest, it's just not happening at all is it? \nManchester City fans couldn't help but laugh at the story that emerged today. Ambitious China-backed Inter plan audacious bid to sign Gabriel Jesus this summer.
