America’s 2nd largest state, Texas, where Obama’s Attorney General Loretta Lynch had sued to block one of the strictest voter ID laws in the nation by — what else — calling it racist . \nObama spent 3 years battling Texas…but Trump’s AG just undid their disgraceful actions with a single order. \nSessions has sent word to Texas that the U.S. government is withdrawing its lawsuit against the Texas law. BREAKING: Attorneys: Trump administration says it will drop federal government's opposition to strict Texas voter ID law. \n— The Associated Press (@AP) February 27, 2017 \nWell-funded leftist groups like the ACLU are devastated by this sudden, massive move. \nNPR reported: \nThe Department of Justice is reversing the federal government’s position in an important voting rights case, involving a Texas voter ID law. Both Trump and Sessions claim voter fraud is a major problem and have backed voter ID laws. \nIn a motion filed Monday, DOJ asked a federal court to dismiss the department’s earlier claim that the ID law was enacted with the intention of discriminating against minority voters . That claim was made by the Obama administration as part of a broader legal challenge to the law, which is among the strictest in the nation. \nVoting rights advocates, who worked with the Obama Justice Department for years on the court challenge, expressed outrage at the reversal. \nAnd according to the Free Beacon , Sessions’ action is “just the beginning,” with Trump’s DOJ planning a “muscular effort” to enact photo voter ID in “every single state they can.” \nAnd why not? The very idea that voter ID is “racist” is completely ridiculous, and it is a joke that in 2017 anyone can tell us with a straight face how we can require photo IDs for everything from boarding a plane, collecting food stamps, and buying booze and even spray paint — but not require it to vote . \nAnd the only “evidence” Trump needs to show in court to win every case in Ami Horowitz ‘ must-see video below that destroys every liberal argument that requiring ID is racist… \nBOOM…case closed. Devastating also in how it reveals liberals as the true racists.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T12:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T11:01:02.214+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
