Congress staging protests on Friday, the lower House managed to introduce the Specified Bank Notes (Cessation of Liabilities) Bill, 2017. \nOn the fifth day of the Budget session, the Parliament reconvenes after Lok Sabha business came to a grinding halt on Friday. \nWith the Trinamool Congress staging protests about the arrest of its House leader Sudip Bandhopadhyay and MP Tapas Pal, the lower House managed to only introduce the Specified Bank Notes (Cessation of Liabilities) Bill, 2017. \nThe Rajya Sabha, on the other hand saw discussions on two private Member Bills on Friday â€” one introduced by Tiruchi Siva of the DMK and another by independent MP Rajeev Chandrasekhar. 2.15 p.m. | Lok Sabha \nMr. Kharge continues. \"There was no discussion on demonetisation in the last session. The opinion outside is that the Opposition stopped it from happening. We brought notice for discussion. We even appealed for the discussion to happen under any rule. But they were not ready for that.\" \n\"There was not even a reference made to the people who died in queues in this House. The least you should do is apologise to the people for this.\" 2.15 p.m. | Rajya Sabha \nThe people of the country support demonetisation, says Mr. Ganesan and concludes his speech. \nRajeev Shukla of the Congress begins speaking. \"Over tea, MPs tell us effects of demonetisation, but outside they say all is well. Please tell the government what is happening on the ground.\" \nHe says cashless economy is a good move, but can't be done with a stick in hand. \"Demonetisation has not been successful in eliminating terrorism or black money.\" 2 p.m. | Rajya Sabha \nHouse reconvenes. Deputy Chairman P.J. Kurien takes the Chair. \nL. Ganesan of the BJP rises to speak on the motion of thanks to the President's address. \"I am from Tamil Nadu. I don't know Hindi, but I will still attempt to speak in Hindi, because I am the MP from Madhya Pradesh.\" \nHe speaks on the girl child scheme. 2 p.m. | Lok Sabha \n\"This year, you have allocated Rs. 48,000 crore. But this is too little. You should double it.\" \n\"You've given green and white revolution to Gujarat only in the past two and a half years. But we gave it to the country decades ago.\" \nHe says the current government operates in a state of \"undeclared Emergency\" where no one can criticise the government. \n\"No one from your side has died for the country.\" Disruption begins. 1.45 p.m. | Lok Sabha \nMr. Kharge brings up the merger of the Rail Budget with the general Budget. \"Why was a 92-year-old tradition done away with?\" \nHe begins speaking about railway accidents. \"You said more money will be spent on ensuring safety.\" \nHe then speaks about MGNREGS. \"Mr. Jaitley has increased the allocation to the highest it has been. They have had reservations about this scheme. This MGNREGS is saving people during drought. Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh brought this in.\" 1.30 p.m. | Lok Sabha \nMr. Singh also mentions the \"56-inch chest.\" \n\"To oppose is democracy,\" he says. \nSlogan shouting commences. Mr. Singh says the country is with the Prime Minister. \nAmendments to the motion of thanks are to be sent to the table within 15 minutes now. \nCongress MP Mallikarjun Kharge rises to speak on the motion of thanks. \"Dr. Mahesh Sharma and Virender Singh have spoken about the motion of thanks. People need to know the truth. Mr. Singh even acknowledged the need of an Opposition in democracy.\" 1.15 p.m. | Lok Sabha \nMr. Singh continues, \"We have improved the situation of farmers in our country.\" \nHe begins speaking about demonetisation. He says that demonetisation has stopped frivolous expenses. 1 p.m. | Lok Sabha \n\"We are heading towards a digital economy. All steps are being taken to make India a great, developed nation. We request the Opposition not to do politics on issues of national security, unity and integrity.\" \nVirender Singh begins speaking now. \"If we were a communal people, we wouldn't have thought of world as our family. How can our government be called communal?\" 12.45 p.m. | Rajya Sabha \nMr. Yadav continues to answer questions on Aadhaar cards reportedly being used to seek MGNREGS employment. \nPiyush Goyal answers a question on solar energy generation. Question Hour comes to an end. House is adjourned till 2 p.m. 12.45 p.m. | Lok Sabha \n\"We have got everything from tourism perspective,\" continues Mr. Sharma. \"We have received Rs. 1.56 lakh crore of foreign currency. As opposed to the world's average of 4.6 per cent, tourism in India is growing at 15.6 per cent. We have set up free helplines for tourists in 12 languages. 60 per cent of ticketing is done online. Five places have been chosen as heritage sites by UNESCO.\" \n\"People would do politics on personalities like Ambedkar. Mahatma Gandhi and Ambedkar belong to the country, not a particular party or group. We released almost all files on Subhash Chandra Bose. Today, the situation is such that the Prime Minister has to mention in his speech that girls do not have access to toilets. 1.4 lakh villages are now open defecation free because of our efforts. You (Opposition) focused on corruption and politics, not on such issues. Demonetisation has been a very important step and so is the effort for digitisation.\" \n\"We have brought in stringent law for the corrupt and frauds who attempting to flee the country. 200 coal mines leased for Rs. 4 lakh crore, and the spectrum auction has brought in over Rs. 1 lakh crore. We increased customs duty on sugar to 40 per cent to help sugarcane farmers.\" 12.30 p.m. | Rajya Sabha \nHussain Dalwai of the Congress says that in Maharashtra OBC and Dalit students are not able to avail scholarships. Rao Inderjit Singh says that unemployment rate has increased across categories and not just for Scheduled Castes. \nD. Raja asks a question on Aadhaar cards being made mandatory for rural poor to seeking MGNREGS employment. \"Minister should know ground realities. People are being asked for these cards. Government is violating Supreme Court directives.\" \nRam Kripal Yadav, MoS Rural Development says that government has not asked for Aadhaar cards. Renuka Choudhary asks what action will be taken on officials demanding Aadhaar cards. 12.30 p.m. | Lok Sabha \nThe Minister attributes the success of GST to the Prime Minister. \"We are working to strengthen the national economy. 1,159 redundant laws that encouraged red tapism have been repealed. 400 more to go. We brought in schemes for sugarcane farmers, loan wavers, insurance for crop failures or destruction. Kisan credit cards are being converted into Rupay cards, irrigation schemes have been brought in. We have proposed Rs. 10 lakh crore loan to farmers. Earlier they would get money from private lenders at much higher rates. Under crop insurance schemes, funds doubled.\" \n\"Earlier there would be riots for fertilizers. Now, we have provided adequate fertilizers to farmers. Earlier, the farmers would suffer losses due to over production. Today, the government is making procurements. Opposition alleges that we are the government for the rich, are these programmes for the rich? 1.20 crore people voluntarily gave up gas subsidy. Nowhere in the world has this happened. Government has so far given free gas connection 1.5 crore households. We have not made any discrimination in giving gas connections. In total, 5 crore such gas connections will be given.\" \n\"4 crore youth are to be given skill development to ensure that they don't have to suffer for employment. Recruitment at class 3 and 4 posts will be done without interview or written test. We are preparing the youth to become job givers rather than being job seekers. A large number of employees would lose their EPF on changing jobs. We have given Universal IDs to ensure that they don't. For pregnant women receiving treatment from government hospitals, Rs. 6,000 is being given. Maternity leave will be doubled to 26 weeks. 56 lakh children have been vaccinated.\" 12.15 p.m. | Lok Sabha \n\"Over Rs. 10,000 crore has been saved by distributing LED bulbs,\" says Mr. Sharma. \"For success, what we need is a 56-inch chest and a heart within. We showed the determination to conduct surgical strikes, our soldiers came back safe. The Opposition sought proof of their patriotism. Where there is a question of national unity integrity and security, there should be no politics. There were a series or scams under the previous regime, the moment we came we set up an SIT. On November 8, we struck against black money. I thank the PM.\" \n\"In 1976, there was a Prime Minister who did not go ahead with demonetisation for electoral politics. Here is the Prime Minister who went ahead with it despite Assembly elections being two months away. We would have been happy had the Opposition been with us in the fight against the black money. So much unaccounted money has come into the banking system, and they will now be used in the nation's progress. They raised questions on this social welfare scheme. They alleged that it was implemented without giving any thought. 107 crore Aadhar card and over 26 crore bank accounts have been opened. People started getting new currency in 24 hours. Was this not part of the planning?\" \n\"The entire nation stood behind the Prime Minister, but the Congress did not come along. The Opposition was waiting for us commit some blunder, but it did not happen. We are working for the benefit of the last man standing, the poor, the farmers, the youth, for the entire nation. Our schemes are not directed at any particularly section or community.\" 12.15 p.m. | Rajya Sabha \nTiruchi Siva of the DMK asks a question on the tribunal. \"The final award of the Cauvery tribunal notified that the Board should be constituted.\" 12 noon | Lok Sabha \nHouse reconvenes. Speaker disallows all adjournment motions. No Zero Hour today. \nMotion of thanks on President's speech is given by MoS Culture and Tourism, amid demands by the Trinamool Congress for time to raise questions. The party stages a walkout. \nThe Narendra Modi government will work for the better of the downtrodden, work for holistic growth of the people, says MoS Culture and Tourism. \"Some politicians divided the society on the lines of caste and communities. People have now realised that such people cannot do anything good for the nation.\" \nThe Minister says the Congress would claim that the incumbent government is claiming success for the schemes launched under its rules, but, \"You ruled for most of the 70 years, and could not implement the schemes. We expeditiously implemented the schemes.\" \nCongress leader Mallikarjun Kharge objects. \nMahesh Sharma says, \"Electrification in UP was done in 266 villages, but it is being implemented in 18,000 villages by us. 41.92 lakh people have been linked to pension scheme.\" 12 noon | Rajya Sabha Question Hour begins \nChairman Hamid Ansari takes the Chair. \nThe first question is on thermal power plants. \"Hydel power plants are not being encouraged,\" says Prem Chand Gupta of the RJD. Power Minister Piyush Goyal responds saying there is no proposal to discontinue hydel power plants. \"Older plants will be phased out and replaced by new ones. NTPC is coming up with new super-critical technology for power plants.\" \n\"Even after projects are completely finalised, they are unable to take off.\" \nD. Raja asks a question on inter-state river water disputes. \"Cauvery water dispute issue went to Supreme Court. Why are you not considering to constitute the Cauvery Water Management Board?\" \nMr. Goyal says the matter is pending in the Supreme Court. \"There is no time frame for these disputes.\" 11.45 a.m.| Rajya Sabha \nChair says the House can have a discussion on this issue in the next session if someone gives notice. \nSpecial mentions are on now. K.C. Ramamurthy of the Congress brings up gender inequality in India. \"India ranks 146 in the world as far as gender equality is concerned.\" \nChair remarks that this has been a productive hour. \nAnand Sharma of the Congress says that the Budget has to be passed before March 31. \"16 hours have been allocated for this. It would only be fair that the discussion starts and continues.\" He also raises the H1B issue. 11.30 a.m. | Rajya Sabha \nChair says maligning of police forces will not be recorded. \"Faults by individuals cannot be used to malign whole force.\" \nCommotion breaks out. \nSomaprasad of the CPI(M) says,\"Government should enhance import duty of titanium dioxide. Public sector units have been closed down.\" K.K. Ragesh of the CPI(M) asks for an increase in the import duty too. \nJoy Abraham of the CPI(M) rises to speak about a captured Catholic priest in Yemen. Chair asks Mr. Naqvi to pass on the concerns with the External Affairs Ministry. \nVivek Gupta of the Trinamool speaks on the case of the missing JNU student Najeeb. \"Is Najeeb just a missing person statistic? It's a clear case of political vendetta. I request Centre to commission a CBI inquiry.\" \nMohammed Nadimul Haque says that former sports persons are not being honoured. \"I would like to bring to the notice of the House the poor financial conditions of former sports persons.\" 11.15 a.m. | Rajya Sabha \nSharad Yadav speaks on junior engineers not getting promotions in the Railways. \"They are being harassed and discriminated against. Railway accidents are increasing. This discrimination needs to be addressed to increase safety.\" \nPratap Singh Bajwa of the Congress raises difficulties faced by BSF personnel. \"It's a matter of shame that our jawans don't have a proper redressal system. There is an issue of salary. They draw less money than their army compatriots.\" Rajeev Shukla asks the Home Minister to make a statement in Parliament on this. \nDerek O'Brien of the Trinamool Congress speaks on the H1B visa issue. \"We need to protect our IT companies.\" \nB.K. Hariprasad of the Congress raises the issue of rape of tribal women in Bastar by police personnel. \"It is a barbaric and beastly act by police officers there. One of the top police officers has been recommeneded for President's award.\" \nVenkaiah Naidu, Urban Development Minister responds saying those who raise such issues sympathise with Maoists. \"Zero Hour is not to defame the forces. Let those who sympathise with Naxalites declare their stand openly. Chhattisgarh is one of India's best performing states.\" 11 a.m. | Rajya Sabha \nHouse convenes. Deputy Chairman P.J. Kurien takes the Chair. Papers are laid on the table. \nAli Anwar Ansari of the JD(U) says that female students in the Banaras Hindu University are discriminated against. \"They are not allowed to access the internet. There is also discrimination against OBC and Dalit students.\" \nParliamentary Affairs MoS Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi says, \"Universities have their own autonomy. If there is a specific event or incident, let us know and we will take action.\" Chair asks HRD Ministry to look into the issue. \nT. Subbarami Reddy of the Congress rises to speak about forest fires, and asks for a white paper from the Environment Ministry and frame a national policy on the same. 11 a.m. | Lok Sabha \nHouse convenes. Speaker Sumitra Mahajan takes the Chair. Obituary references are made. Question Hour begins \nAs Question Hour commences, almost immediately there are shouts from Members. \nSome members gather at the well of the House on the E. Ahamed death issue.
