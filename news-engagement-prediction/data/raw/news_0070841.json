Even by Katy's standards, this one was a little out there, but also a little pedestrian — that was until Left House fell from the first story and into the basement. The Falling Housing Market — Ali (@ChocMilkSheikh1) February 22, 2017 \nEagle-eyed viewers spotted that the (currently unknown) \"Left House\" took a tumble off stage, seemingly to never return to the housing market again. Could it be a witty social commentary on the state of the housing market at the moment, or just some poor dancer who can't see through a giant f*cking house costume? \nMove over Left Shark, Perry has a new cash cow. Some may remember Left Shark, the dancer from the Super Bowl XLIX halftime show, whose wild moves lead to worldwide fame, a Wiki page, and even tattoos to commemorate the occasion. How long until someone gets a tumbling house tattooed on their leg? — Jamie Hough (@jmehough) February 22, 2017 \nAside from \"bringing the house down,\" Perry's performance was also slightly overshadowed by the use of two giant puppets, who, viewers were quick to spot, bore a slight resemblance to a certain POTUS and Prime Minister of the UK. Not content to just take a pop at affordable housing, Perry was clearly mocking the relationship between Trump and May. Ms. Perry should soon expect to find herself under fire on Twitter and probably banned from the USA. \nSee also: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T12:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:19:19.898+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
