It’s definitely a little more drastic this year than it’s been over the last couple of years,” Braun noted. “A lot of new faces, a lot of young guys.” \nBraun’s first impression of Lewis Brinson is that the outfield prospect is “impressive physically,” before adding that all the younger players look bigger than previous incarnations of up-and-comers. \nWhen Braun gazes around the clubhouse at the new-look Brewers, he also likes what he sees. \n“There’s a lot of young guys who are potentially impact players,” Braun said. “Most of them are at the upper levels of the minor leagues, so hopefully that means we’re not too far away.” \nAs one of the older players on the team and the longest-tenured Brewer, Braun said he is fine with being a mentor to the younger players and enjoys it, too. \n“It’s really important for them to hear it from players who have been through it,” he said. “Coaches can help, front office can help, but having teammates who have actually gone through the transition from the minor leagues to the major leagues and have dealt with failure and adversity at the major-league level can really be beneficial to guys.
