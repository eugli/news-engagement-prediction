Good thing there’s some good stuff arriving this month to keep you occupied. The Highlights \nAs has been the case for several months now, the big push here is once again Netflix originals. That kicks off with the first season of Marvel’s Iron Fist, a show about a superhero doing superhero things and probably kicking people. There’s also 13 Reasons Why, a teen suicide drama directed by Tom McCarthy based on the popular young adult novel of the same name . Other new series include One More Time , Beau Sejour , and Samurai Gourmet . As for returning shows, Love comes back for its second season of bored-skinny-white-30-somethings-in-Los-Angeles-doing-things, and Grace and Frankie lines up for its third season. Netflix is also dropping a few new feature length films, including the Hell Week coming of age drama Burning Sands , the comedy-caper Deidra & Laney Rob a Train , the South Korean nuclear disaster film, Pandora , the Madalyn Murray O’Hair biopic Most Hated Woman in America , and finally, the much talked about The Discovery .

In conjunction with that, Netflix is offering up a ton of classic World War II documentaries, including How to Operate Behind Enemy Lines , Let There Be Light, Prelude of War, and a bunch more. \nAs for non-Netflix titles, Disney’s The BFG ( RT: 75% ) and Pete’s Dragon ( RT: 86% ) are easily the biggest highlights. Life Aquatic ( RT: 56% ), Archer season seven, and the ‘90s teen goth totally not lame at all classic , The Craft ( RT: 50% ) all also arrive this month.

The 2014 Emile Edwin Smith Oscar vehicle and dramatic tour de force Mega Shark vs Mecha Shark is also leaving.
