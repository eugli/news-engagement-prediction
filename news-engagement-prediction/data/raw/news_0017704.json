Fatal crash in Berrimah \nThe rain caused havoc on the roads in Darwin, with one of the city's largest - Bagot Road - being closed early Sunday morning due to flooding over the Kimmorley Bridge at Rapid Creek. \nThere was a fatal car crash at the corner of Amy Johnson Avenue and Tiger Brennan Drive in Berrimah, after a car slid into an intersection and hit a traffic light pole about 1:00am. \nThe car caught fire and the driver died, with two passengers taken to Royal Darwin Hospital. \n\"The male inside the vehicle unfortunately [was] trapped and was unable to be extracted by his fellow male passenger and a passerby who tried to get him out,\" Duty Superintendent Rob Burgoyne said. \nTrees were brought down by squally winds, with one coming down at the entrance to the hospital. No-one was injured. \nThe BOM issued a severe weather warning for heavy rainfall for people in parts of the Daly District at 11:00am. \nNT Emergency Services have advised people to secure loose outside objects and seek shelter when conditions deteriorate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T08:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T04:29:48.160+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
