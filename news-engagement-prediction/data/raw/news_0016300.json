It features four editions: avast! Free Antivirus , avast! Pro Antivirus, avast! Internet Security and avast! Premier . Differences between Free, Pro, Internet Security and Premium The first one is the most popular since it shares the antivirus, anti-spyware and anti-rookit engine along with the real-time guard with the paid editions. Pro adds SafeZone, a feature designed to ensure secured payments and banking operations while navigating the Internet, while Internet Security throws an anti-spam module and silent firewall mode into the mix. Premier is the complete version, featuring extra tools for automatically keeping other programs updated, in addition to remote access and file shredder. Configurable installation package All main components can be handpicked for the setup procedure while excluding the rest. However, users should keep in mind that avast! Pro Antivirus is ad-supported, so it offers to install additional utilities that it does not actually need to work properly. They can be avoided with a little attention. Intuitive UI and multiple scanning modes with customized settings The tool is wrapped in a pleasant and organized interface, where all components are neatly organized. Different types of scanning methods are available for users, depending on their preferences. They have optimized settings and can be altered in terms of types of scanned objects, heuristics, potentially unwanted files (PUPs) and other suspicious items, generating reports, excluding files and folders marked as trusted, automatic course of action once threats are identified (or prompt for action), and so on. Extra security measures to ensure online safety Apart from the previously mentioned SafeZone feature, Pro contains SecureLine to ensure data privacy via VPN, a sandbox to run suspicious applications confined in a secured virtual environment without doing any real damage to the computer, along with a rescue mode to boot Windows in case it becomes unresponsive due to heavy malware attacks. Performance and conclusion Users may either favor scanning speed or machine resources consumption by adjusting avast!'s priority level. The components can be easily enabled and disabled with just a click of the mouse, as well as tweaked in detail by advanced users. Concerning malware detection ratio, avast! Pro Antivirus delivers very good results. It is frequently a favorite choice among the user community, so it's definitely worth taking it for a spin.
