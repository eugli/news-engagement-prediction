He and his wife, Robin, came to this hillside outpost to look out at the Oroville Dam, like hundreds of others in recent days who were suddenly all too aware of infrastructure, spillways and reservoir levels.\nOne week before, they were among the 180,000 people ordered to evacuate their homes amid fears that erosion had compromised the dam’s spillway system, which is used to regulate the water in the dam’s reservoir.\nThe situation has improved and the immediate threat of catastrophic floods has passed, according to state officials. But many here in California’s Central Valley remain on high alert for potential evacuations because of the heavy rain that continues.\nStorms in recent days have overwhelmed Northern California’s levees, flooded its rural towns and closed highways. That the Oroville Dam, the nation’s tallest, reached such a grave condition has raised questions about whether California’s infrastructure is up to the task.\nThe Bowens came to see it with their own eyes: “It’s going to be all right, there’s nothing to worry about now,” said Larry Bowen, 71.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:57:58.488+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
