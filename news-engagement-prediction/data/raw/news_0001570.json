McConnell and Dallas Mavericks point guard Deron Williams. \nHowever, a familiar name surprisingly came out of the woodwork to proclaim his desire to re-join the organization: Baron Davis. \nAccording to Sam Amick of USA Today , the 37-year-old point guard is very interested despite playing just six games in the D-League last year. \nHe averaged just 12.8 points and 3.5 assists over 22.5 minutes in those games, too, which is far from desirable at that level. \nIn the 2010-2011 season, Davis played 15 games (nine starts) for the Cavaliers and put up 13.9 points and 6.1 assists per contest in 25.3 minutes per contest. \nIn 2011-2012, his last professional experience in the NBA, Davis was limited to just 29 games (14 starts) for the New York Knicks. In 20.5 minutes per game, he shot an abysmal 37 percent from the field for 6.1 points with 4.7 assists per contest. \nBut, for much of his career, he was a dominant player in the league. Check out some of his career highlights below and you’ll recall just how productive he was. \nHowever, it’d take a leap of faith for Cleveland to give him a chance, especially with a number of other guards working out for them on Wednesday. Not only has Davis been out of action at the NBA level for a long time, but he was far from productive in his last seasons. \nBut, as with anything that the eccentric Davis is involved in, it’s fun to think about.
