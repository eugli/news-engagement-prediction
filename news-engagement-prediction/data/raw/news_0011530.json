JO MOIR/ FAIRFAX NZ \nMarae officials put up tarpaulins to block views into Te Tii Marae, Waitangi. \nOn Saturday the lower marae shut its gate, doors, gaps in hedges, footpath and road to media wanting to record or film the powhiri for the Governor-General. \nREAD MORE: * Traffic chaos ahead of Waitangi weekend \nThe marae belongs to the people and they absolutely have the right to decide who to welcome into their home - but in banning the media they shut the door on the millions of New Zealanders who couldn't be at Waitangi yet wanted to feel a part of the events there. JASON DORDAY/FAIRFAX NZ \nTe Tii Marae representatives used tarpaulins to shut media out from the powhiri for Governor-General Dame Patsy Reddy. \nWaitangi is special to those who call it home but it also means something to anyone who calls New Zealand home. \nFebruary 6 is our national day and the events leading up to that day are relevant to the whole country. \nEverything from the new Governor-General, Dame Patsy Reddy, being welcomed to Waitangi for the first time to politicians' vision for the country for the year ahead - all of that is important to more than just those sat on Te Tii marae this weekend. JASON DORDAY/FAIRFAX NZ \nDozens of police officers lined the perimeter of Te Tii Marae and kept media and the public at a distance. \nEnglish has already thrown his support behind the government travelling to a different destination each year to recognise the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi and there seems to be plenty of public support for it. Ad Feedback \nThe likes of Davis, Peters and Fox are right when they say Waitangi Day will always exist at Waitangi whether the government is there or not. \nBut if the trustees of Te Tii Marae can't open their home for two days to the rest of the country to experience and witness the events that lead up to our national day then are they really the right people for the job? JO MOIR/ FAIRFAX NZ \nThere has been a strong police presence at Waitangi. \nThere's a high chance plenty of other iwi, hapu and whanau would welcome the opportunity and responsibility that comes with hosting these events. \nNew Zealand is a country that prides itself on being friendly, hospitable, warm and welcoming to all those that travel so far to visit. \nIt's high time we treated each other the same way on the day we're meant to be remembering how we all came to be living together in this little slice of paradise. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T10:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T07:23:58.498+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
