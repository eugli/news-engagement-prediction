Lol. ‚Äî NICKI MINAJ (@NICKIMINAJ) February 3, 2017 I met #GiuseppeZanotti years ago. At which time, he told me I inspired him to design a sneaker in my honor. Wore them on the cover of Cosmo \n[Editor‚Äôs note: Minaj did wear the sneakers, though it appears she wore them for Glamour in 2011 .] \nThe 34-year-old entertainer‚Äôs problems with Zanotti arose when she found out the designer was making capsule collections with other artists (most recently Zayn Malik and Jennifer Lopez ), which would presumably give the collaborator a share of the shoe‚Äôs profits. Recently when he gave other artists capsule collections, my agency reached out and was told they're not taking our call. ü§î ‚Äî NICKI MINAJ (@NICKIMINAJ) February 3, 2017 \nMinaj claimed that because she was black, she could only ‚Äúinspire‚Äù Zanotti, but not partner with him: Just go on google, you'll see all the different pairs he's named after me. Lil black girl can inspire u but ain't worth a collection my nig? ‚Äî NICKI MINAJ (@NICKIMINAJ) February 3, 2017 \nMinaj retweeted a fan‚Äôs photo of some of the ‚ÄúNicki‚Äù shoes that show up when you search for them in the designer‚Äôs collection: In total there are 23 different shoes named after her #RunMeMyCHECK #GiuseppeWhatsGood pic.twitter.com/jIw94bAXi0 ‚Äî Tom Ford (@ThatShadyCunt) February 3, 2017 \nToward the end of her Twitter call-out, Minaj said she wouldn‚Äôt permit this ‚Äúracism and disrespect.‚Äù She called on her fans to start Tweeting or Instagramming the hashtag #GiuseppeWhatsGood, a reference to her famous line to Miley Cyrus at the MTV Awards. #RunMeMyCHECK #GiuseppeWhatsGood I got time today. üòä barbz trend this cuz he gon learn today.
