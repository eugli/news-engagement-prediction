Police are suspecting that he had committed suicide as petrol and some matchsticks were found close to his body. \"De was an introvert and did not mingle with the neighbours,\" locals said. \n\n\"De used to stay isolated in the flat. He did not talk to anyone in the complex,\" neighbours said. \"He used to come down for a brisk walk in the morning every day, but he was not seen for the past few days,\" said a neighbour. Police are yet to ascertain when he died. The body has been sent for autopsy. \n\nDe was placed in a mental hospital after police spotted him living with skeletons and then he was staying with Missionaries of Charity for some time after which he had started staying alone. Psychologists fear that due to acute depression he might have committed suicide. His father, Aurobindo De, had also committed suicide after setting himself on fire in June 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:25:22.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
