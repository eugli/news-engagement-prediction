'I hope I will play a full part in helping the team in the fight for success on four fronts.\nWayne Rooney has announced he will not be leaving Manchester United captain next week\nRooney has started three games for United since December 17 under manager Jose Mourinho\n'It's an exciting time at the club and I want to remain a part of it.' The statement ensured the Rooney issue will not overshadow Sunday's EFL Cup final against Southampton at Wembley and United's pursuit of the FA Cup and Europa League in the final three months of the season.\nBut with the 31-year-old unhappy at being a fringe player, and United keen to move his £15million-a-year wages off the books, it is highly unlikely that Rooney will be at the club next season.\nThursday's statement was a common-sense move and one instigated by the Rooney camp, who approached United with the idea. So the China crisis is over, but was there ever a genuine possibility he would leave for the Far East before the Super League transfer deadline on Tuesday?\nRooney is in contention for a recall to the United squad at Wembley after missing the last five games with a combination of illness and a hamstring injury, and it was unacceptable for the player and his club to go into what could be his last cup final for United amid talk that he could leave for the Chinese Super League 48 hours later.\nThe statement ensured the Rooney issue will not overshadow Sunday's EFL Cup final\nThe skipper can now focus on winning back his place. He has been on an individual fitness programme at Carrington this week and is said to be raring to go.\nThe injuries suffered by Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Michael Carrick in the Europa League win at Saint-Etienne on Wednesday underlined the importance of keeping Rooney until the end of the season.\nFixtures are piling up and Jose Mourinho can ill afford to wave his captain off to China, however marginalised Rooney has become in recent months.\nFor a man who has twice appeared on the brink of leaving Old Trafford during his 13-year spell at the club, Rooney knows how quickly circumstances can change. But a similar U-turn this time is very unlikely given how deeply frustrated he is with his reduced role under Mourinho.\nMourinho had earlier this week revealed that Rooney would be able to decide on his future\nSTATEMENT IN FULL 'Despite the interest which has been shown from other clubs, for which I'm grateful, I want to end recent speculation and say that I am staying at Manchester United.\n'I hope I will play a full part in helping the team in its fight for success on four fronts.\n'It's an exciting time at the club and I want to remain a part of it.'\nUnited are open to the possibility of him going this summer, 12 months before the end of his contract. It would be a more dignified exit than the United captain heading to China little more than a month after becoming the club's all-time record goalscorer.\nNews that Stretford had flown to Beijing for talks with Chinese clubs this week raised the stakes. But Jiangsu Suning and Beijing Guoan, two of the biggest teams in the Chinese Super League, are understood to have kept their distance.\nTianjin Quanjian confirmed they had held talks with the Rooney camp but said he did not suit their style of play. Of the other four clubs with a spare slot for a foreign player, none had the means to offer Rooney what he wanted. A deal of this nature does not happen overnight. And what about Rooney's wife Coleen and three young sons, happily settled in Cheshire?\nThe forward became United's all-time leading goalscorer with his 250th strike against Stoke\n'Given the timescale, it was always going to be a difficult deal to complete at this stage with all the ramifications of Rooney's contract here and with any club he joined,' said a United insider. 'It's plain to see that everything is set up to be evaluated in the summer.'\nSo what does happen at the end of the season? The China talk will continue and it remains to be seen if he heeds the warnings of his old team-mates.\nRoy Keane has said that it would be 'madness' for Rooney to go to the Far East. Phil Neville has urged him to 'stick it out' at United and Gary Neville believes he should think carefully before making a decision.\nRooney, pictured playing in Duncan Ferguson's testimonial in 2015, could return to Everton\n'If Wayne's unhappy and doesn't want to sit on the bench, then maybe there would be a move,' said Gary Neville. 'I saw at United with very good friends — Nicky Butt, my brother — they got to a point where they wanted first-team football.'\nA sentimental return to Everton has been mooted and manager Ronald Koeman did not close the door on that possibility on Thursday, telling Rooney that he is too good to waste his talent in China.\n'He is still on that high level to compete in a competition like the Premier League,' said Koeman. 'If you make a choice like China, the first reason is about money.'\nPaul Scholes, meanwhile, believes that Rooney would be better off seeing out his career in Major League Soccer. Stretford was in America in September and October for talks with clubs and new team Los Angeles FC are in the market for marquee players.\nWhatever happens, it is clear Rooney's statement has only put the speculation on hold for a short while.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/DailyMailManUnited"], "published": "2017-02-24T00:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T15:24:44.538+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
