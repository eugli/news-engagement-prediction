The family's news comes just weeks after Beau and Kara were spotted looking happy and loved-up while enjoying a day at the beach. Kara kept her bump under wraps in a frilly, polka-dot one-piece, while shielding her face from the sun with pair of sunglasses. Bumping along nicely! Kara was spotted showing off her figure in a frilly one-piece as she enjoyed a day at the beach in Bronte just weeks earlier Loved-up: The blonde beauty put on an amorous display with her husband as they soaked up the sun on the packed beach The beauty salon worker stunned in the plunging bathers as she strutted along the sand. Kara and Beau looked upbeat as they went for a dip at Sydney's packed Bronte Beach. And on New Year's Day, the couple enjoyed an idyllic cruise with their friends and family. Taking to Instagram at the time, the pregnant beauty stunned as she showed off her figure in another black swimsuit, wrapping her arms around her man. 'We had the best day out on the boat today bringing in the the New Year with our family and Friends,' Kara shared. 'Three, soon to be four': Married since 2012, the happy couple are already proud parents to four-year-old daughter Remi 'Excited. Happy. Blessed': Kara echoed the news on her own social media page, sharing the same sweet message and photo It appeared she was attempting to keep her bump under the radar by shielding it with her hand, while posing behind Beau. The news of Kara's pregnancy comes over a year after the family was rocked by Beau's alleged cheating scandal. The former Wests Tigers player reportedly had an affair with former Hi-5 singer Lauren Brant, whom he met while working on the stage production of Aladdin. In early 2016, Kara opened up about the alleged 'cheating' scandal that rocked her marriage, telling Woman's Day : 'I was actually more worried for Beau, if I'm honest.' Cruising along nicely: Kara took to Instagram on New Year's Day to share a loved-up snap with her husband, seemingly keeping her bump under the radar in a black swimsuit 'I'm probably emotionally stronger than Beau, and I could see how upset he was, so I was more concerned for him and our family,' she confessed. Despite the allegations, Kara maintained Beau was still a good husband and father to Remi. 'The grass isn't always greener, and while it was a difficult situation, running from anything in life is never the answer,' she said.
