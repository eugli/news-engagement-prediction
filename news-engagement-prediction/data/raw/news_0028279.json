' \n\nHadi slams door on Bersatu for keeping ties with DAP, Amanah \nJust a Malaysian: Pakatan Harapan and Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu) … what more do you need? The door has been slammed in your face. A new Malaysia without a bunch of robed old geezers awaits. \nAwak: PKR deputy president Azmin Ali and Bersatu president Muhyiddin Yassin are experienced politicians. But, they look like novices when they tried to get PAS to join the opposition bloc. \nDon't they have eyes to see; ears to hear and brains to think, that PAS president Abdul Hadi Awang and Umno president Najib Razak are good buddies? \nNeither has attacked each other. They have held hands and hugged like best of friends. \nBoth use DAP as the bogeyman to pull away Malay support for Bersatu, PKR and Amanah. In doing so, Hadi indirectly helps Umno in a three-cornered contest. \nAnyway, in PAS, Hadi is like a mullah, and calls the shots. \nSuaraRakyat: Alhamdulillah, thank you Hadi, you are doing a service for Malaysia. \nHarapan must move on without waiting for PAS. Even if the opposition wins Putrajaya with PAS cooperation, can you trust they would not then go and join Umno? PAS, who won with the opposition’s help may bring down the new government and let BN take over again. \nIt will be like Egypt, a glorious revolution and then back to military rule. \nHcleong: PAS is and would never be a good partner to run the country. They have narrow-minded goals to take care of Muslims only. They are willing to work with thieves and call them brothers. \nNo doubt PAS will be a vote spoiler in any three-cornered fight. The last by-elections in Kuala Kangsar and Kuala Selangor had proven the point. It worked well for BN to put a wedge between PAS and Pakatan Harapan. \nNow it is better to forget PAS. Bersatu, Amanah and the rest must work hard to win over Malay voters in order to thrash BN. Otherwise the country will continue to be raped and robbed. \nHeadhunter: What Hadi is doing is a perfectly planned strategy created to give BN a chance to win the next general election. \nEither option is a lose-lose situation for Bersatu, and Abdul Hadi Awang knows it. He had been working with BN all along to backstab Bersatu. Everyone distrusts Hadi except for Azmin Ali. \nKawak: Azmin is now nervous. He thinks he may lose his MB's post if PAS does not cooperate with PKR in Selangor. Let’s see whether he is courageous and a principled politician. \nHello: How does Hadi explain his working with PKR, which has ties with DAP, while saying PAS will not work with Bersatu as it maintains ties with DAP? He sounds like an incoherent psychiatric case fit for Hospital Bahagia residence. \nJoe Lee: The onus is now on PKR to call it quits with the devil that is running PAS. \nPKR has to accept its own weakness in the Malay heartland. It has accepted that it needs Bersatu to win over the Malays. If PKR cannot change and reinvent, it will die. And so be it. PAS under Hadi was always going to be the big spoiler for Najib’s benefit. \nAnonymous 2436471476414726: Stubborn and stupid Hadi. He is prepared to work instead with a kleptocratic government. PAS is an Islamic party that approves of theft, corruption and abuse of power. Might as well change the name of your party. You have contaminated the name of Islam. \nAirman: This guy just wants MPs to support his 30 years’ jail, RM100,000 fine and 100 lashes punishment against Muslims for offences against Islam. Why only always want to punish people and claim those against his proposal are against Islam? \nThat essence of that religion is compassion, mercy and justice. Forget this guy and the green party that he is leading. \nChowkit: Deceitful is the best way to describe the faction that is now controlling PAS. \nGotcha: Hadi will put PAS to rest for good. Clown of PAS who ruined the party. PAS should merge with Umno. \nAllforit: Hadi has said it loud and clear. Thank goodness. Opposition, please move on. I can't imagine Malaysia being run by people like Hadi. We would find ourselves going backwards. \nThe above is a selection of comments posted by Malaysiakini subscribers.
