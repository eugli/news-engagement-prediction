It appears that she really liked it.\" \nAnother participant, Claudio Alvarez, said the breed had a unique charm. \n\"Having someone to take care of, to treat in a special way, because it's a special breed that needs a lot of care, makes it so that you have an even greater connection with him,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T03:16:18.447+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
