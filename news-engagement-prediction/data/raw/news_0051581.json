Not the romantic variety — though he did spend Valentine’s Day alone — t he singer spent a day off from his Purpose world tour lounging poolside in Acapulco, Mexico. He stayed at the luxe Banyan Tree Cabo Marques resort , a source confirms to PEOPLE.

As the only AAA Five-Diamond Award-winning hotel in Acapulco, the beach paradise is the perfect place for a star seeking absolute solitude. The resort’s 45 private villas are surrounded by scenic mountains and offer views of the Pacific Ocean and St. Lucia Bay. Its lobby terrace is suspended over the ocean, seemingly floating in mid-air and completing the magical atmosphere. The Asian-inspired hotel’s top-of-the-line Spa Pool Villa, which starts at $1,650 per night, is located at the edge of the sea and features a spacious, private outdoor massage and relaxation area, a personal heated pool, a modern bathroom with full-length windows and panoramic views. courtesy Banyan Tree Cabo Marques WATCH THIS: Inside Britney Spears $30 Million Valentine’s Day Airbnb With Boyfriend Sam Asghari \nThe zen-like setting is also an excellent place for the controversy-ridden star — he was most recently accused of head-butting a man at a West Hollywood restaurant — to step away and recenter, as the hotel boasts a focus on achieving “well-being for mind, body and soul.” The on-site spa employs highly trained therapists and follows a philosophy of “serenity, warmth and comfort.” Bieber’s Purpose tour picks up in Perth, Australia, on March 6, and returns to the U.S. in July.
