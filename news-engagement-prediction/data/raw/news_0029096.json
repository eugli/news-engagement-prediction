Sara was a gifted actress with a unique voice. \n“Even when she was navigating the tribulations of Caroline Sterling’s love life, Sara’s deft wit and clever characterisation meant Caroline was never solely defined by her relationships but always as a fully rounded, intriguing woman of substance. \n“We will all miss her both professionally and personally.” \nFor the latest news on this story keep checking back at Sun Online, where we will bring you live updates as soon as they happen, before anyone else. \n\nLike us on Facebook at www.facebook.com/thesun , and follow us from our main Twitter account at @TheSun , where we will bring you this story and all the rest of the top news and exclusives of the day. \n\nThesun.co.uk is your go to destination for the best celebrity news, football news, real-life stories, jaw-dropping pictures and must-see video ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T19:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T15:02:00.826+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
