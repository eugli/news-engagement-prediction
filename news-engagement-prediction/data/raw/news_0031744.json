He even got his own beard wrong! \nIt just goes to show you how strong that Edelman/Brady bromance truly is. \nThumbnail photo via Robert Deutsch/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T09:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T15:41:47.938+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
