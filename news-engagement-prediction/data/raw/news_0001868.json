Hundreds of soldiers were relentlessly pursued for more than a decade as a result. Not a single case has resulted in a prosecution. Mr Tabachnik said Mr Shiner had paid Mr Younis £500 in referral fees for each of four clients that he brought to him in September 2007. He described how Leigh Day profited from £4.3million for taking on the case of 95 Iraqis who sued the British Government at taxpayers' expense. This money was carved up, with £1.6million paid to Mr Shiner's PIL in fees and £1.6million to Mr Younis. Mazin Younis (right) was also handed £500 by disgraced lawyer Phil Shiner (centre) for each Iraqi he persuaded to accuse soldiers of committing murder or torture, it was said Mr Tabachnik acknowledged that Mr Shiner had told his employees that cold-calling potential clients was not acceptable, but added: 'The sorry reality of this case is that when the allegations crossed Professor Shiner's desk all of that was put to one side. What became of paramount importance to him was to locate the clients. This was an opportunity he was not prepared to let slip.' But after five years of investigations, the Al-Sweady public inquiry concluded that the allegations by Iraqis were based on 'deliberate lies, reckless speculation and ingrained hostility'. The tribunal yesterday heard how cases dried up when Mr Younis refused to find more clients unless he was paid referral fees for historic cases, which is not allowed under the solicitors' code of conduct. Mr Tabachnik accused PIL and Leigh Day of making a 'disguised' payment of £50,000 to Mr Younis for the historic cases. The hearing continues.
