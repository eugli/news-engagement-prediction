But that’s a bit like saying you’ll never sleep with your ex again after breaking up. Or you’ll “definitely go for a drink” with that guy you used to work with. Because what happens is real life kicks in – you get lonely, you get lazy, you lose 2-0 to Hull – and before you know it you’re making a 3am booty call/a potential friendship is lost forever/you’re heading back to the Ruhr to try and sign Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Only one of the three reportedly applies to Klopp today, and it’s the third one. The Sun , which said yesterday that Manchester City are trying to sign the Gabonese goal machine, says today that Liverpool are also trying to sign the Gabonese goal machine. Maybe they’ll say tomorrow that Chelsea are also trying to sign the Gabonese goal machine – we don’t know. All that matters is people click on it – and Hot Football Transfer Gossip has. The tabloid explains, “Klopp clearly feels P-EY is just the striker Liverpool need to make a sustained title challenge”. P-EY? Either they think the Gabonese goal machine’s surname starts with a Y, or we’ve started talking about someone else. Assuming it’s the former, we are then told that Klopp will fund a £40m swoop for “P-EY” by selling Daniel Sturridge. In fact, it’s possibly this £40m valuation the Sun has placed on Aubameyang that is attracting different clubs to buy him every day. He’ll surely cost a tad more than that, won’t he? In addition to selling Sturridge, Klopp will also attempt to offload Simon Mignolet in the summer and replace him with Man City loanee Joe Hart, says Talksport . Another goalkeeper who could be on the move is Thibaut Courtois, at least if his agent has anything to do with it. The Star reports that the big Belgian’s representative has been “calling Real Madrid every day” trying to convince the Spanish giants to sign his client, mainly because David de Gea is the club’s first choice transfer target. Awkward. Chelsea and Arsenal are interested in Atletico Madrid winger Yannick Carrasco, but they will face competition from “a host of big clubs” including Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain ( Sun ). Not fancying Arsenal’s chances at this stage, to be fair. Elsewhere, Liverpool will try to sign Nottingham Forest’s teenage striker Ben Brereton in the summer ( Metro ), the Reds will battle Chelsea, Man Utd, AC Milan and Juventus for the signing for Atalanta’s Ivorian midfielder Frank Kessie ( Calciomercato ) and Barcelona will try to “hijack” Man Utd’s move for Benfica defender Victor Lindelof that has been about a year in the works and could potentially make Ed Woodward cry if it doesn’t happen after all that ( Manchester Evening News ).
