Shaun Cummings’ late, wonderful goal sent the Den barmy as Leicester joined Bournemouth and Watford in being chewed up by the Lions. Millwall fans needed no invitation to storm the pitch in celebration at full-time.\nA ground that was only half full when Bournemouth visited in the third round in January was bursting at the seams as fans started to believe that Neil Harris’s men might do something special this season. Never has the Beatles classic been so lustily bastardised as by the home fans, adapting Hey Jude to “Mill-wall” as the teams made their way onto the pitch.\nLincoln City topple Burnley as Sean Raggett seals historic FA Cup shock Read more \nThe home side quickly settled into their customary banks of four, with the youngster Fred Onyedinma asked to partner the redoubtable Steve Morison up front. Leicester were their unfamiliar selves as the reserves who fought past Derby County in the last round were given their head again. Yohan Benalouane and Molla Wagué formed a new central defensive partnership, while up front Shinji Okazaki led the line with a trio of supporting forwards behind him.\nIn the opening minutes the match looked like many had expected, the League One side hustling the freefalling champions into unsteady touches and misplaced passes. But as the game went on, Leicester settled and began to dominate possession.\nThey were given confidence by the performance of Okazaki, who looked a cut above the rest of the players on the pitch in the first half, able to deal equally well with long balls and intricate passing. In the 16th minute he span past his marker, Byron Webster, to bear down on Jordan Archer in the Millwall goal. Webster got back at him and Okazaki stumbled at the final moment, but still he managed to lay the ball off to the winger Demarai Gray, whose left-footed shot was blocked. A minute later, from a corner, Okazaki turned a powerful header towards goal, forcing Archer into a reaction save.\nIn the 28th minute Okazaki might well have given Leicester the lead had he better anticipated an early cross from Bartosz Kapustka, the young Polish international, starting well for the Foxes.\nManchester City held by Huddersfield on blank day for Sergio Agüero Read more \nMillwall looked to be not quite themselves in the first half. As it became clear that Leicester might be able to effectively apply their extra quality, the home side looked to lose a little confidence and suddenly the ravenous energy was not so apparent in Harris’s side. Their best moments in the first half came from set pieces and the scraps that followed. One melee after a fumble by the German keeper Ron-Robert Zieler earned Jake Cooper a yellow card. But in truth the German wasn’t properly tested.\nThe second half began with Leicester continuing to look the hungrier and within 10 minutes they appeared to have earned a distinctive advantage. A Leicester break saw Kapustka thread the ball to Ahmed Musa on the right. The Nigerian had Cooper in close attention and took advantage, spinning him to invite the challenge. It duly arrived, Musa went over it and the referee, Craig Pawson, opted to show Cooper a second yellow card.\nA few minutes later Okazaki was inches away from meeting a cross, again from a corner. But all of a sudden, Millwall were roused, team and crowd fired up by perceived injustice. For the first time, “No one likes us, we don’t care” could be heard from the stands. Aiden O’Brien saw a shot blocked when it was heading on target, Morison forced another block with a header from a corner, and Zieler did well to hold onto Shaun Williams shot. This game was still in the balance.\nLeicester were forced into a defensive change when Wagué hobbled off to be replaced by the old warhorse Marcin Wasilewski. With the final 15 minutes of the match approaching, Jamie Vardy also joined the fray in place of the underwhelming Grey and was roundly booed by the home support. His first touch was to fire just past the post from 25 yards out.\nWith 10 minutes remaining the best chance of the match fell to Okazaki after Vardy’s shot deflected into his path. The Japanese striker tried to lift the ball over Archer, but the keeper was smart enough to read the effort and blocked it strongly. Archer then turned Okazaki’s cross away from Vardy.\nThen, with the match ticking into added time, bedlam. A cross from Shane Ferguson found Lee Gregory on the edge of the box and the substitute, with his back to goal, played a beautiful blind pass through Leicester’s back four where, of all people, the right-back Shaun Cummings was marauding forward. He collected the ball, shifted past a challenge and finished coolly with his left foot under Zieler. There was pandemonium on the pitch, in the dugout and the stands. Leicester desperately threw men forward but to no avail. The League One side, not the Premier League champions, would be advancing to the quarter-finals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T19:33:33.412+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
