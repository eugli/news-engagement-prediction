Wochit\nI've never been body-shamed. I've never been told I'm doing it wrong. I've never been criticized, publicly embarrassed, or even judged by strangers for any interaction I've had with my son.\nIt has taken four years of being a dad to realize these things. To understand that I seem to parent free of that spotlight that scans the internet looking for parenting mistakes to shine on.\nBut it only took me a few moments to realize why exactly I've lived judgement free.\nI'm a dad and society collectively reserves its venom for mothers. What I'll never understand is why.\nWhy do we go after moms so much? Why does everything mothers do have to be the subject of public debate?\nThinking I'm making this up? You do, I know. I can foresee the Facebook comments, already.\nSo I decided to Google \"mother shamed\" and head into the rabbit hole of lunacy.\nThe very first link was to a story about a mom in Pittsburgh being shamed for breastfeeding in a waiting room. Why in the hell is this still a thing?\nBabies eat all the time. Moms who decided to breastfeed have to do stuff all the time. Literally, science.\n (Photo: Louie Villalobos/The Republic)\nThe worst part is that we then shame those same mothers if they decide to not breastfeed. Give your baby formula and watch the shamers descend from the ceiling.\nFurther down the Google results is a new term I learned while writing this blog. And there's lunchbox shaming. Like we're so dedicated to shaming parents and mothers that we have subcategories. This mom made the mistake of including some chocolate in her child's lunchbox. Shame.\nRELATED : Viral video has us judging parents\nThen there's the ever popular fat shaming. This is where things get extra crispy. So a woman has to carry a child for several months, gaining weight and having her organs rearranged in the process. Then the baby arrives by one of two ways. The mother pushes the baby out in what can only be described as a herculean feat of strength that requires a level of vulnerability that I could have never imagined.\nOr, the child is taken from the motherâ€™s body after the body is first ripped open.\nAfter all of that brutality, we then shame the moms if they don't get back to their playing weight two days later.\nWhy! Why do we make it so they're evil if they decide to go back to work full time or lazy if they decide to stay home instead?\nAnd why in the world does it seem like moms are the ones doing much of the shaming of other moms? Mom-on-mom crime.\nMORE : Trump presidency could have lasting impact on my son\nDads? Do not worry about us. All we have to do is show up and we're heroes. We attend a couple school functions, go to a doctor's appointment or two, and we're good.\nWe don't have to worry about how society sees our bodies, our parenting or our desire to work while still somehow managing to love our children.\nOur bodies aren't politicized. Our decisions aren't examined. And we don't really seem to care about how other dads do dad stuff. Oh, and we don't have to worry about equal pay for equal work unless we're advocating for women to go ahead and finally get that.\nWe can come and go as we please. Being a dad rules.
