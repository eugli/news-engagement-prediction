"highlightText": "", "language": "english", "persons": [], "text": "The ongoing verbal barbs being traded by Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor is giving boxing a bad name, according to two-time world champion Saul ‘Canelo’ Alvarez who believes the fight would be “a joke”.\nThe prospect of undefeated boxer Mayweather and UFC two-time simultaneous champion McGregor fighting in a boxing match now looks to be a near certainty, with both camps locked in a verbal back-and-forth regarding negotiations and who would emerge triumphant.\nThe 39-year-old Mayweather, who retired in 2015 with an unblemished 49-0 professional boxing record, has spoken publicly to reveal that the fight could go ahead this year, but also posted messages on social media to dismiss reports that a deal had already been agreed for the fight to take place.\nRead more Could McGregor v Mayweather really happen? The 28-year-old McGregor meanwhile has taken a much more provocative approach to try and tempt Mayweather into agreeing to a fight, having taunted the American for not meeting him in Las Vegas during his visit across the Atlantic last week.\nCurrent WBO light-middleweight and lineal middleweight world champion Alvarez, whose one and only defeat in his 51-fight professional career came against Mayweather in September 2013, has criticised the ongoing spat between Mayweather and McGregor, and believes they are dragging the name of boxing through the mud in the process.\n\"It's a joke for boxing if that happens,\" Canelo told Reuters ahead of his bout against Julio Cesar Chavez Jr in May. Chavez added: \"It is a businessman fight. I like to fight a serious fight.\"\nAlvarez lost to Mayweather in the American's penultimate fight (Getty) However, despite the criticism of the proposed ‘superfight’ from inside the sport, renowned trainer Freddie Roach revealed that Mayweather has recently attended his Wild Card gym in Los Angeles where he told him that the fight with McGregor is on course to happen.\nUFC 205 Conor McGregor vs Eddie Alvarez 28 show all UFC 205 Conor McGregor vs Eddie Alvarez 1/28 Conor McGregor vs Eddie Alvarez Conor McGregor walks out of UFC 205 the first simultaneous two-weight world champion.\nZuffa LLC via Getty\n2/28 Conor McGregor vs Eddie Alvarez McGregor celebrates his KO win over Eddie Alvarez UFC 205 to hold the lightweight and featherweight titles.\nZuffa LLC via Getty\n3/28 Conor McGregor vs Eddie Alvarez McGregor became the first man to hold two different belts in UFC history.\nZuffa LLC via Getty\n4/28 Conor McGregor vs Eddie Alvarez McGregor continues to set the benchmark in the UFC.\nZuffa LLC via Getty\n5/28 Conor McGregor vs Eddie Alvarez Referee John McCarthy waves off the main event after Alvarez is floored for a fourth time.\nZuffa LLC via Getty\n6/28 Conor McGregor vs Eddie Alvarez McGregor utilised his left hook counter to floor Alvarez three times in the first round.\nZuffa LLC via Getty\n7/28 Conor McGregor vs Eddie Alvarez McGregor taunted Alvarez by holding back hands behind his back and urging him to throw a punch.\nZuffa LLC via Getty\n8/28 Conor McGregor vs Eddie Alvarez Alvarez had no answer for McGregor's speed and power.\nZuffa LLC via Getty\n9/28 Tyron Woodley vs Stephen Thompson Tyron Woodley retained his welterweight title by majority draw against Stephen Thompson.\nZuffa LLC via Getty\n10/28 Tyron Woodley vs Stephen Thompson Thompson survived a barrage of punches as well as a long gullotine choke hold.\nZuffa LLC via Getty\n11/28 Tyron Woodley vs Stephen Thompson Thompson was busted open on the bridge of his nose in the first round.\nZuffa LLC via Getty\n12/28 Tyron Woodley vs Stephen Thompson Woodley floored Thompson and dominated the opening round but Thompson would fight back.\nZuffa LLC via Getty\n13/28 Joanna Jedrzejczyk vs Karolina Kowalkiewicz Joanna Jedrzejczyk was pushed all the way by fellow Pole Karolina Kowalkiewicz.\nZuffa LLC via Getty\n14/28 Joanna Jedrzejczyk vs Karolina Kowalkiewicz Jedrzejczyk dominated Kowalkiewicz for the first three rounds before the tables turned.\nZuffa LLC via Getty\n15/28 Joanna Jedrzejczyk vs Karolina Kowalkiewicz Jedrzejczyk remains the strawweight champion.\nZuffa LLC via Getty\n16/28 Chris Weidman vs Yoel Romero Chris Weidman suffered a brutal defeat after catching a flying knee from Yoel Romero.\nZuffa LLC via Getty\n17/28 Chris Weidman vs Yoel Romero Romero's flying knee split Weidman's head wide open to end the fight.\nZuffa LLC via Getty\n18/28 Miesha Tate vs Raquel Pennington Miesha Tate announced her retirement after defeat by former apprentice Raquel Pennington.\nZuffa LLC via Getty\n19/28 Miesha Tate vs Raquel Pennington Pennington dominated Tate for the entire three rounds.\nZuffa LLC via Getty\n20/28 Miesha Tate vs Raquel Pennington New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr was at ringside for the bout.\nZuffa LLC via Getty\n21/28 Frankie Edgar vs Jeremy Stephens Frankie Edgar got back to winning ways by defeating Jeremy Stephens.\nZuffa LLC via Getty\n22/28 Frankie Edgar vs Jeremy Stephens Edgar dominated Stephens but was rocked badly in the final round.\nZuffa LLC via Getty\n23/28 Khabib Nurmagomedov vs Michael Johnson Khabib Nurmagomedov immediately called out Conor McGregor after defeating Michael Johnson by submission.\nZuffa LLC via Getty\n24/28 Tim Boetsch vs Rafael Natal Tim Boetsch knocked out Rafael Natal in the first round.\nZuffa LLC via Getty\n25/28 Vincente Luque vs Belal Muhammad Vincente Luque beat Belal Muhammad inside 90 seconds.\nZuffa LLC via Getty\n26/28 Vincente Luque vs Belal Muhammad Luque caught Muhammad with a counter left to end the bout.\nZuffa LLC via Getty\n27/28 Jim Miller vs Thiago Alves Jim Miller beat Thiago Alves in the early preliminaries.\nZuffa LLC via Getty\n28/28 Liz Carmouche vs Katlyn Chookagian Liz Carmouche beat Katlyn Chookagian in the early preliminaries.\nZuffa LLC via Getty\nRoach also revealed that he would be open to training McGregor to face the unbeaten American, as he did with Manny Pacquiao when the legendary Filipino faced Mayweather in the ‘Fight of the Century’ back in May 2015.\nMayweather beat Pacquiao two years ago ti win his 48th consecutive fight ( Getty )\n\n\"According to Mayweather, yes.
