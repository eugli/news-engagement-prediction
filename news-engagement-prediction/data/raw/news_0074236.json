Searching for answers: Dylan Hartley and James Haskell speak to referee Romain Poite Charlie Morgan  00am \nT o perpetuate the cricketing analogy deployed by Eddie Jones after a stuttering win over Italy on Sunday , the end result – a 36-15, bonus-point victory for his team – is in the book. In years to come, the scoreline alone will hold no clues as to how an odd encounter unfolded and just how ugly England made their runs. \nThe post-match press conferences were refreshingly fortnight. But whether you sympathise with Jones’ irritation or associate more keenly with the fierce self-defence of Azzurri coach Conor O’Shea, the central narrative was irrefutable. \nThis game saw an extremely limited side cleverly capitalise upon rugby’s breakdown laws to unsettle their more talented opponents. And, until England regrouped at half-time, it worked very well. \nTaking advantage of World Rugby’s ruck definition, outlined below, is nothing new. \nM ore than half a decade ago, Ben Ryan’s England Sevens outfit were leaving the tackle area alone to nullify the offside line in defence. For at least the past two Super Rugby seasons, the Chiefs have tried the tactic – mainly to disrupt opposition exit plays following restarts. \nRarely in the 15-a-side arena has a team persisted with it for such a large proportion of a contest. But Italy’s perseverance was due mainly to England’s failure to respond with any conviction. Gori scenes \n‘The Fox’ – as Brendan Venter and O’Shea christened this method – first appeared with just 90 seconds on the clock. Scrum-half Edoardo Gori hoists a box-kick for wing Giovanbattsita Venditti to chase: \nA s Mike Brown comes forward to collect, watch Italy flanker Braam Steyn: \nV enditti fells Brown and rolls clear of the tackle area immediately. Ben Te’o and Dylan Hartley are over the ball, but no Italy player is in contact with them. This constitutes open play, so there is no offside line. \nSteyn is entitled to push up into midfield, and tries to block off scrum-half Danny Care from his first-receiver Joe Launchbury: \nR efree Romain Poite, who was notified about Italy’s intentions in a routine midweek meeting, communicates clearly. In this instance, something of a false dawn, England react well. \nCare throws a dummy. Gori, who led Italy’s use of the tactic, and Steyn run too far and Launchbury emerges the other side of them to take a pass: \nH owever, the hosts were to struggle later on. Just 10 minutes later, Italy pegged them inside their 22. Again, no Italian commits to the ruck. Gori and Sergio Parrise surge through, with Poite again vocal in his identification of an open-play situation. The body language of George Ford speaks volumes: \nT ommaso Allan and Luke McLean advance on the openside as well, with Steyn pushing up on the blindside. This forces Care into a hurried decision. Lawes volunteers himself for a short carry to the left: \nB ut this only bunches seven of England’s forwards (identified by their shirt numbers) tighter together. Italy simply stand off when the tackle on Lawes is made. \nThe players beyond the ball do not have to retreat. An exasperated Care has no passing options. He glances at Poite, who reiterates that there is no ruck… \n…and hurries a clearance down-field: \nG enerally, Italy were exceptionally co-ordinated in carrying out their plan – and Poite did penalise them on the rare occasions they lapsed. Here, after a run from Jonny May, Te’o meets Allan over the ball to form the ruck: \nG ori presses beyond the offside line anyway. And while Simone Favaro is in a legal position as Owen Farrell adopts the role of scrum-half… \nG ori is correctly pinged: \nO n the whole, Poite was dealt with in-game scenarios well. That said, he was not particularly sympathetic to England’s early attempts to adapt. Reading pictures and uncertain conversations \nWith the game still scoreless after end of a grim first quarter for England, James Haskell addresses Poite at a break in play for a scrum. He thinks Italy are engaging with the tackle area, urging clearers to commit, before pulling away. \nSkipper Hartley agrees, but Poite sticks to his guns: \nP laying for the Brumbies against the Chiefs in last season’s Super Rugby competition, David Pocock reached out to grab Michael Leitch – a hero of Eddie Jones’ 2015 Japan side – as he tried to edge around the tackle area. \nThe referee for that game, Australian Angus Gardner , adjudged that a ruck had been formed. Because another Chief, Brodie Retallick, had advanced beyond the back-foot of the newly-established ruck, the Brumbies were awarded a penalty. \nJoe Launchbury actually tries this with England looking to clear after forcing a turnover metres from their line. He grasps Luke McLean, but Poite does not call a ruck and Gori can stay where he is: \nA t the next break in play, Poite seems to voice the belief that Italy must be willing participants if a ruck is to be called: \nT he Frenchman wants to see a picture close to the one that accompanies World Rugby’s definition of a ruck: \nU nfortunately, in the modern day menagerie of jackals and crocodile rolls at the breakdown, the setting is hardly ever this clean and England fall foul of a grey area five minutes before half-time. \nAs they are pressing just outside the Italy 22, Parrise attempts a counter-ruck: \nP oite responds quickly, telling Italy’s defenders that a ruck has formed and they must stay still: \nE ngland launch their phase-play structure, Care finding Ford. Forward runners Haskell and Lawes line up outside the fly-half, with Owen Farrell in behind: \nH askell is sent up with a flat pass… \n…and three Italy tacklers converge to halt England’s single carrier. Lawes changes direction to support his teammate: \nA nd this picture results because McLean, part of the tackle, has lingered long enough to engage clearer Lawes. Is McLean now part of the ruck? It is a matter of interpretation: \nM cLean then backs away, separating himself from Lawes and the tackle area. Throughout this, Poite remains silent. Gori arcs around the melee… \n…and cuts off Care from first receiver Ford: \nA ndrea Lovotti fills in at the guard position, covering the snipe and coaxing Care into forcing a pass to Ford: \nT he excellent Michele Campagnaro reads the play and intercepts: \nA t the next stoppage, with Gori receiving treatment, Hartley tries once more to clarify matters with Poite: \nH artley’s question, of whether a ruck can elapse and become a tackle situation after a clearer has brought a contesting opponent to ground, is not answered. Instead, Poite stresses his desire to have players on their feet – something so rarely officiated in recent times. \nIt should be highlighted that England’s first half was sloppy across the board – the worst under Jones so far. Technical discipline left a lot to be desired, both at the set piece and the breakdown. \nThey kicked badly, and their collective sluggishness was encapsulated in Venditti’s try, when he stole past a plethora of England players to collect a rebound off the post: \nH owever, England regathered themselves during the break and rescued the game thanks to three factors. Step one: Restart revamp and maul manipulation \nItaly only had one restart in the first half following Dan Cole’s try. Allan sent his kick deep, probably aiming beyond England’s second lifting pod of Cole and Launchbury in order to lure England into running the ball out of their 22: \nT hat way, Italy could set up a tackle situation and attempt to disrupt England’s exit routine. Allan’s strike is slightly too strong, though. It reaches Care on the full… \n…and the scrum-half punts straightaway: \nT he ball goes out into touch around 40 metres from the England line: \nT his is a big win for the Azzurri , who count the driving maul as a primary weapon. \nHere, as Allan prepares to begin the second half, both lifting pods – Marler with Lawes and Cole with Launchbury – have dropped ever so slightly deeper towards the England line: \nT his time, Launchbury can back around in time to field Allan’s kick, and his surrounding forwards gather together: \nM aking sure the ball begins at the front – the number of the carrier is in red – so as not to be penalised for obstruction, England’s forwards look to establish a maul… \n…but Marco Fuser is strong enough to splinter it. Lorenzo Cittadini and replacement scrum-half Giorgio Bronzini creep past the ball, which has been transferred to Lawes by this point: \nE ngland read the situation and react sharply. Hughes takes the ball from Lawes and bursts through. Cittadini brings the number eight down, but England have gathered impetus: \nI taly commit nobody to form a ruck, so Steyn and Bronzini are entitled to edge around to block off England’s right. Hartley combats this by taking out Andrea Lovotti. Launchbury sees the space this creates… \n…and makes another strong carry through the middle to make a statement at the beginning of the second period: \nL aunchbury took Italy’s next restart in precisely the same manner. This time, England’s shape is tighter and they manage to instigate a maul. Of course, this creates an offside line – nullifying any foxes: \nT hough Cittadini fights hard to get through the middle, the maul rumbles over the 22 and wins a penalty when Steyn cannot resist joining it from the side, having started in an offside position anyway: \nB y the time of England’s third try, Launchbury and co. have a polished routine. The Wasp takes and his forwards gather rapidly in support. But Launchbury notices that Italy’s chase is tired and slow. \nHe picks a gap between lock Fuser and tighthead prop Cittadini… \n…and bursts through it… \n…crossing halfway: \nA closer examination of England’s second try, scored by Elliot Daly, demonstrates that England modified their phase-play approach as well. Step two: Narrow lines, acute angles and taking space \nWe begin this sequence after a strong carry from Haskell. Hughes and Farrell are over the ball, while Ital have again left the tackle area alone. Parisse and Bronzini have danced around the fringes, forcing England to tighten up: \nF irst, Launchbury and Lawes brush past Parisse and Bronzini – Poite reportedly made the point to Italy that they could only use no-ruck tactics on the proviso that they stayed at least a metre away from the scrum-half. \nNeither Launchbury nor Lawes pick from the base. Instead, Hughes reaches back – there is no offside line, remember – and grasps the ball… \n…before taking on Cittadini at guard: \nH ughes then turns, transferring to Lawes: \nL aunchbury is on hand to protect the ball, while Farrell storms in… \n…and takes out Steyn: \nD ries Van Schalkwyk and Fuser file across to plug the right fringe for Italy as Itoje stoops to pick up the ball… \n…and both Italy locks commit to the tackle. By this point, Haskell has bounced to his feet. He cuts an aggressive angle back against the grain and latches onto an offload from Itoje. \nL ovotti is too wide to double back and stop Haskell and England are in behind Italy: \nL awes can free his arms to release and offload to Ford. Allan jams in with his wing Giulio Bisegni, but Care runs a clever supporting arc… \n…receiving a return pass from Ford… \n…and releasing Te’o… \n…who puts Daly over the line. \nI f Michele Campagnaro’s sublime individual try gave Italy hope, another Exeter Chief snuffed out the Azzurri’s ambition of a historic win. Step three: Free role for Nowell \nDuring the half-time break, Jones was seen on the pitch, delivering instructions to Jack Nowell: \nA s we have already seen this Six Nations, Nowell is one of England’s most resourceful and versatile attackers. When he joined the fray, replacing Jonny May with around 25 minutes remaining, his first touch was a carry directly from scrum-half and fellow replacement Ben Youngs: \nG iven Italy’s foxing was leaving gaps around the fringes, Jones clearly thought the deceptive power and evasion of Nowell would help England punch holes. He was right. \nNowell steps back off his right foot here… \n…and though he only breaks the gain-line by three or four metres, Youngs has time to hoist a high ball. What is more, because Nowell has carried into contact rather than a forward, Itoje and Lawes are free to mount the chase: \nY oungs’ kicking game is a big strength of his and this strike is on the money. Allan collects… \n…but is bundled into touch by Itoje: \nF rom the resulting lineout, Farrell pulls back a pass to Ford behind Hughes. With Hughes’ decoy dragging Italy narrow, Te’o can aim at a hole between Allan and McLean: \nF ord launches his centre towards the gap. Now, track Parisse, Youngs and Nowell: \nW hen Te’o hits the deck, there is no ruck and Parisse tries to pounce; \nY oungs beats him to the ball, and transfers a gut pass to Nowell: \nN owell shunts another couple of metres ahead into Pietro Ceccarelli, with Jamie George and Te’o forming a ruck… \n…which Poite announces, meaning Italy have an offside line to adhere to: \nT his movement ended in a disallowed try for Nowell, Hughes adjudged to have impeded McLean. Nowell did manage a vital brac later though, and indirectly helped forge the opening for England’s fifth. \nWe join the action as Brown’s kick-return is halted by Campagnaro. Scuttling back infield, Brown reaches the 15-metre line, meaning England have a sizeable blindside to take advantage of. \nTe’o and Farrell are busting a gut to fill that blindside, while Nowell – out of shot having just tried to charge-down Italy’s clearance kick – is doing the same: \nT om Wood and Itoje form the ruck and Youngs has made his decision to attack right, towards the blindside. Italy’s replacement fly-half Carlo Canna finds himself in the unfamiliar role of guard, while Venditti must stay wide to cover Farrell, Te’o and Nowell: \nY oungs throws a dummy towards that side, tempting Canna away from the guard position, and darts forward. Kyle Sinckler edges towards Youngs’ right shoulder… \n…and receives an offload that sent him on a 30-metre charge: \nT e’o strolled in from the next phase and Nowell completed a six-try victory soon afterwards, linking up with Youngs to spin over from a close range. \nJones wanted to test combinations and find fluency in this third round. Instead, he will have learned very little. Italy foxed England and forced them to feed off untidy scraps. \nOther areas of their game were well below par and Scotland should absolutely fancy their chances of laying siege to Twickenham for a Triple Crown. A fortnight of build-up ensures plenty of scope for mind games. \nThat said, England’s six-try win is in the book. Awkward encounters such as these build character and game intelligence. A second straight Grand Slam and the world record winning run remain on the table, rucks or no rucks. \nMatch images courtesy of ITV and RBS 6 Nations Follow Telegraph Sport", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T12:23:29.618+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
