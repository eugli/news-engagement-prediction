GETTY Marine Le Pen's ratings have surged in the polls \nThe economist said that if many other countries leave the bloc then it could be forced to change “unrecognisably”. \nHe said: “It could become a much looser confederation, more like a council of Europe with less control over so many areas of legal policy.” \nIn 2013, former Prime Minister David Cameron said that if the Conservatives were to win the next election they would give the British people the choice between staying in the EU or not. GETTY Experts think that there could be referendums across Europe about EU membership \nThis came at a time when Ukip, led by Nigel Farage, was riding high in the polls and Mr Cameron felt the pressure to promise the referendum so he could ensure a majority government. \nOther European countries will be looking closely at how well the UK does out of the bloc to see whether they should follow suit. \nIf France and the Netherlands were to leave the European Union, economists believe that German taxpayers could protest at having to pay for the funding shortfall. \nLast year, Dutch referendum voters rejected closer EU links to Ukraine giving evidence of Eurosceptic feeling in the Netherlands. \nThe Netherlands Eurosceptics Thierry Baudet and Jan Roos persuaded the Dutch parliament to adopt a law requiring the government to hold a referendum on any law if 300,000 citizens request it. \nMr Wilders is unlikely to garner enough votes to form a government outright, and will need to negotiate a coalition if he is to take power.
