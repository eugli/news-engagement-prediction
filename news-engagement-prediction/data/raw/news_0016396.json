(Photo: Steve Mitchell, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nUSA TODAY Sports' NBA power rankings for Week 14 (Sunday, Jan. 29 through Sunday, Feb. 5) of the 2016-17 season. \nTEAM (RECORD) MOVEMENT \n1. Golden State Warriors (43-8) - \nOther than Saturday night's three-point overtime loss to the Kings, the Warriors have been hot, winning eight of their last 10 while posting an NBA-best 115.5 offensive rating. Back-to-back MVP Stephen Curry has followed suit, averaging 30 points (on 52.2% shooting), six three-pointers (on 51.4% shooting), 7.8 assists and 4.6 rebounds. \n2. San Antonio Spurs (39-11) - \nThe Spurs boast the NBA's top defensive rating (101.3 points allowed per 100 possessions) and the league's second-best net rating (plus-9.5). This week, they recovered from losses to New Orleans and Dallas with wins over Oklahoma City, Philadelphia and Denver by a combined 54 points. \n3. Houston Rockets (37-17) - \nThe Rockets, who have gone 5-5 over their past 10 games but still sit in third place in the Western Conference, have a favorable February ahead of them. Of their seven games, six are against sub-.500 teams and five are at home. PointAfter | Graphiq \n4. Cleveland Cavaliers (34-15) - \nAfter a 7-8 January and with trade rumors galore, the Cavs started off February on the right foot with wins over the Timberwolves and Knicks, but will have their work cut out for them with road games against Washington, Indiana and Oklahoma City on tap. \n5. Boston Celtics (33-18) +3 \nRiding a seven-game winning streak — headlined by wins over the Rockets, Raptors and Clippers — the Celtics are just two games behind the first-place Cavaliers. What's more, starting shooting guard Avery Bradley (achilles) is expected to return this week. \n6. Utah Jazz (32-19) - \nDespite the fact that All-Star caliber forward Derrick Favors, who has dealt with a nagging knee injury all season, is averaging just 9.1 points and 5.9 rebounds in 22.9 minutes, the Jazz aren't only on pace for their first playoff appearance since 2012. They're on pace for homecourt advantage come playoff time, too. \n7. Washington Wizards (30-20) +3 \nLed by All-Star point guard John Wall, a healthy Bradley Beal and a much-improved Otto Porter and Markieff Morris, the Wizards are the hottest team in the Eastern Conference. The Wizards, who are in the midst of a seven-game winning streak and 17-game home winning streak, have gone 24-9 since Dec. 1 — the third best record in the NBA during that span. \n8. Los Angeles Clippers (31-20) -1 \nSince Christmas, the Clippers have a 9-11 record, the NBA's 24th-ranked defense (110.6 points allowed per 100 possessions) and have a minus-2.5 net rating, which ranks 21st. They lost their ninth straight game to the Warriors on Thursday, furthering the distance between themselves and the Western Conference elite. \n\"They performed at a much higher level than us, it wasn't even close,\" Clippers coach Doc Rivers told reporters after the loss. \"They're a better team until we prove differently.\" \n9. Memphis Grizzlies (31-22) +2 \nThe Grizzlies won three of their four games this week (at Phoenix, Denver and Minnesota) by a combined 47 points. Their lone loss came to Oklahoma City on Friday as Russell Westbrook (38 points, 13 rebounds, 12 assists) recorded his 25th triple-double of the season. \n10. Toronto Raptors (31-21) -5 \nTrouble in Toronto? The Raptors have lost seven of their last 10, including games against Orlando (twice), Phoenix and Charlotte and All-Star guard DeMar DeRozan has missed seven of Toronto's last eight games with an ankle injury. They're now in fourth place in the East, 4 1/2 games behind the Cavaliers. \n11. Atlanta Hawks (30-21) +1 \nThe Hawks put together a late-game comeback to beat the Rockets, 113-108, on Thursday night despite 41 points, eight rebounds and eight assists from MVP frontrunner James Harden. Hawks center Dwight Howard, who spent the past three seasons with the Rockets, led the way with 24 points and 23 rebounds. . @DwightHoward was a beast last night 💪 pic.twitter.com/EqHUU062mW — Atlanta Hawks (@ATLHawks) February 4, 2017 \n12. Oklahoma City Thunder (30-22) -3 \nWarriors forward Kevin Durant, who spent his first nine NBA seasons with the Thunder franchise, returns home on Saturday for the first time since his offseason departure to The Bay. The game — at 8:30 p.m. ET on ABC — will be Durant's third time playing his former team this season. In the first two meetings? He scored 39 and 40 points, respectively, and led the Warriors to two wins — 122-96 and 121-100. \n13. Indiana Pacers (28-22) - \nThe Pacers, who are in the midst of a six-game winning streak, have a tough stretch before the All-Star break, with games against Oklahoma City, Cleveland (twice), Washington (twice) and San Antonio. \n“Right now, we’re starting to learn, we’re starting to figure each other out, we’re starting to gain some identity and we’re starting to get some chemistry,\" All-Star forward Paul George said recently . \"That’s the difference.” \n14. Chicago Bulls (25-26) +1 \nThe Bulls won two of their three games this week, taking down Philadelphia 121-108 on Sunday, Jan. 29 and Oklahoma City 128-100 on Wednesday. Their lone loss came on Friday in overtime to James Harden (42 points, 12 rebounds, nine assists) and the Rockets. \n15. Miami Heat (21-30) +11 \nThe Heat were 11-30 on on Jan. 14, in 14th place in the East and bound for the lottery. After Saturday night's 125-102 win over the 76ers, they're 21-30, just two games out of eighth place and looking like an entirely different group. \n\"We're not thinking about the win streak,\" Heat center Hassan Whiteside told reporters after the win. \"We're a whole different team than we were a month ago. Guys are healthy. Guys are playing together. We're a whole different team.\" Whiteside - 30 & 20 in 26:47!Only player in @NBAHistory to accomplish that faster? Bill Laimbeer (1985). 35pts & 21rebs in 21 minutes. pic.twitter.com/OWfnrGPE1Q — Miami HEAT (@MiamiHEAT) February 5, 2017 \n16. Detroit Pistons (23-28) +3 \nThe Pistons' mediocre 2016-17 continued this week, with losses to Eastern Conference foe Boston and Indiana and wins over New Orleans (118-98) and Minnesota (116-108). \n17. Charlotte Hornets (23-28) -3 \nThe Hornets, in the midst of a seven-game losing streak, rank 20th in the NBA in fourth quarter points allowed (25.9). They also have the NBA's worst defensive rating (124.6 points allowed per 100 possessions) in clutch situations (final five minutes when the score is within five points). \n\"I think we're sixth in fourth-quarter offense in the league, but we're 19th or 20th in fourth-quarter defense,\" Hornets coach Steve Clifford told reporters after Saturday's loss to the Jazz. \"Our first few years we were top five. ... Our fourth-quarter defense has been our biggest problem.\" \n18. Denver Nuggets (22-28) -2 \nThe highlight of the Nuggets' week came on Friday, when budding star Nikola Jokic returned from a three-game absence (hip) and posted the first triple-double (20 points, 13 rebounds, 11 assists) of his career en route to a 121-117 win. Nikola Jokic notches his first career triple-double for the @Nuggets with 20 points, 13 rebounds & 11 assists! #MileHighBasketball pic.twitter.com/LhVwzUKycm — NBA (@NBA) February 4, 2017 \n19. Milwaukee Bucks (22-28) -1 \nThe Bucks snapped their five-game losing streak on Saturday with a 137-112 rout of the Suns, but after losing eight of their past 10 games, they sit a 1/2 game out of the Eastern Conference playoff standings — a far cry from what they're capable of. \n20. Portland Trail Blazers (22-30) -3 \nThe Trail Blazers, a game behind the Nuggets for eighth place in the West, play five of their seven remaining February games on the road, where they have an 8-19 record this season. \n21. Dallas Mavericks (20-30) +4 \nThe Mavs' week was highlighted by the emergence of Yogi Ferrell , who scored a career-high 32 points in Friday night's win over the Trail Blazers. Riding a four-game winning streak, which is tops in the Western Conference, the Mavs are creeping up on the playoff picture, just two games behind the eighth-place Nuggets. What a night for the rook... as @nbadleague alum @YogiFerrell11 puts up 32 points... including 9 threes to tie the most by a rookie! #MFFL pic.twitter.com/wOfsbbnx7U — NBA (@NBA) February 4, 2017 \n22. New York Knicks (22-30) - \nThe Knicks, who sit 1 1/2 games out of eighth place in the East and whose lone win of the week came on Wednesday against the Nets, have a tough February ahead, with games against the Clippers, Spurs, Thunder, Cavaliers and Raptors on the schedule. \n23. Sacramento Kings (20-31) - \nThe Kings snapped their three-game losing streak with a shocking 109-106 win over a sloppy Warriors team on Saturday, led by All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins, who finished with 32 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists. It was his 21st time this season scoring 30 or more points. \n24. Minnesota Timberwolves (19-32) -3 \nForgot the fact that the T'Wolves lost three of their four games this week. Their biggest lost came on Friday night against the Pistons, when starting shooting guard Zach LaVine suffered a torn ACL. The 21-year-old was having a career-year, averaging 18.9 points (on 45.9% shooting) and 3.4 rebounds. \n25. New Orleans Pelicans (19-32) -5 \nThe Pelicans have lost their last four games (Washington twice, Toronto and Detroit), but it looks like All-Star forward Anthony Davis may be finally getting some frontcourt help. According to USA TODAY Sports' Sam Amick , the Pels are in serious trade talks with the 76ers to acquire second-year big man Jahlil Okafor. \n26. Orlando Magic (20-33) +1 \nThe Magic, who lost three of their five games this week (Minnesota, Indiana, Atlanta), rank 27th in the NBA with a minus-6.2 net rating on the season and have the NBA's 22nd ranked defense despite the offseason hiring of defensive-minded head coach Frank Vogel. When asked about his team's defensive effort after the 113-86 loss to Atlanta, Vogel described it as \"terrible.\" \n\"It's disappointing. It's just disappointing,\" he told reporters . There's no other word for it.\" \n27. Philadelphia 76ers (18-32) -3 \nPlagued by injuries to Joel Embiid (knee contusion), Robert Covington (hand contusion) and Jahlil Okafor (knee soreness), the 76ers have come back down to earth a bit, losing three straight and five of their last six. Still, they're just two games away from their highest win total since the 2012-13 season. \n28. Phoenix Suns (16-35) - \nThe bright side of the Suns' three-loss week? Rookie forward Marquese Chriss put together the best stretch of games of his young career, recording a career-high 20 points in Monday's loss to the Grizzlies and 27 points in Saturday's loss to Milwaukee. \n29. Los Angeles Lakers (17-36) - \nThe biggest news in Laker Land this week came on Thursday, when the team announced that Hall of Famer Magic Johnson will return to the organization as an ownership adviser. According to a news release sent out by the team, Johnson's duties will include, but won't be limited to, \"advising ownership on all business and basketball matters, collaborating with coaches, evaluating and mentoring players, assessing future franchise needs and helping ownership to determine the best path for growth and success.\" \n30. Brooklyn Nets (9-42) - \nThe Nets, who have one win in 2017 and a .176 winning percentage on the season, are on pace for their second worst season in franchise history, trailing only the 2009-10 New Jersey Nets squad that went 12-70. \n\"Teams play with a lot of confidence against us,\" guard Joe Harris told reporters after Friday's loss to the Pacers. \"Guys look at our record and where we are in the league and they play with a lot of confidence. They're very aggressive and it's making it very difficult for us to close out games.\" \nList of voters: USA TODAY Sports' Jeff Zillgitt , Sam Amick , Kevin Spain , AJ Neuharth-Keusch and Michael Singer ; The Arizona Republic's Doug Haller ; The (Memphis) Commercial Appeal's Ronald Tillery ; Detroit Free Press' Vince Ellis ; Indianapolis Star's Nate Taylor ; The (Bergen) Record's Steve Popper ; HoopsHype.com's Jorge Sierra and Raul Barrigon ; USA TODAY Sports Weekly's Howard Megdal . \nNEVER MISS OUT Sports Stay in the know and in the zone, 7 days a week, with scores, analysis, and in-depth features and commentary.
