And so, we could certainly assemble in the United States. And we do in Chippewa Falls for SGI; we do in Houston, to some degree, for our enterprise group. But the entire supply chain — everything from memory, from motherboards, I mean everything that is in our products comes from overseas. And by the way, that supply chain has taken 30 years to set up. So when all those components come in and are taxed, it's not going to be good for companies that have a relatively low margin and a big offshore supply chain.\" \nShe added that she is working with Congress to make sure that this point of view is well understood. \nHer comments follow Trump's favorable comments about the proposal in an interview with Reuters on Thursday. \n\"It could lead to a lot more jobs in the United States,\" he told Reuters , using his most positive language to date on the proposal. However, he did not specifically endorse it. \n\"I certainly support a form of tax on the border,\" he added. \"What is going to happen is companies are going to come back here, they're going to build their factories and they're going to create a lot of jobs and there's no tax.\" \nTrump previously sent conflicting signals about his position on the tax proposal. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal in January he said it was \"too complicated.\" He added: \" Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don’t love it. Because usually it means we’re going to get adjusted into a bad deal. That’s what happens.” \nBut then shortly after he told Axios that , \" It's certainly something that's going to be discussed. [...] I would say, over the next month-and-a-half, two months, we'll be having more concrete discussions.\" \nSeparately, the New York Federal Reserve said in a post Friday February 24 that the proposed border tax adjustment \" is unlikey to promote US exports .\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T18:39:19.138+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
