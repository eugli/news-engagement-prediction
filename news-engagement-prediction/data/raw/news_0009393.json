This measure is designed to encourage trainers and owners to make as much use of the many women riders within the industry in the afternoons as during morning training.\" \nAs well as Pattern races in both codes, another exception will be the daily Quinte Handicap, while there will be an overall limit of 4.5kg in allowances will apply for women apprentices. \nDe Rothschild has long been a supporter of the promotion of female jockeys and did much to expand the programme for races restricted to female riders during his first two terms in office between 2003 and 2010. \nSir Anthony McCoy opened the debate over weight allowances for women jockeys in 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T17:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:44:22.446+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
