'Environment is winning over community' \nThe council said if the basin plan took more water, it wanted something back. \nGreg Nicol, who runs an agricultural supplies business in Dirranbandi, said it was time the Government dealt with the socio-economic impacts of water recovery. \n\"I think morally, ethically and legislatively, they've got a responsibility somewhere within the Murray-Darling Basin Plan it actually says that there has to be a balance between environment and socio-economic. \n\"And at the moment, environment is winning â€¦ over community,\" Mr Nicol said. \nIn trying to reframe the debate, the local council said it was prepared to think outside the box, considering all options to help transition the economy, from boosting tourism to bringing a sheep and wool industry back to the region. \n\"As well as capacity building and implementation of those plans, we need help now too,\" Ms Gaske said. \n\"There are people here who are in dire straits. \n\"And it's not just about this bandaid. \n\"We don't just want people to fly in and pour buckets of money into our community and then fly out again, because that's not going to help us in the long term. \n\"It really is about having the capacity to develop sustainable infrastructure in agricultural industries and diversifying and then being able to keep that moving forward into the future,\" she said. \nBut solutions will need to come soon if the town is to be saved and, in the meantime, Mr Nicol said locals were tired of being treated as a curiosity. \n\"We very much feel like zoo animals. \n\"We just continue to get people coming out and poking at us and hoping that we smile maybe or give a funny expression or something and they go away we just need this fixed,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T10:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T08:18:47.612+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
