Whatever I said about each of the actors was said just for fun at that moment. I love and respect the Indian film industry specially Salman Khan is such a huge star and so humble.” \nThe actor is making her debut in Bollywood with the upcoming Irrfan Khan starrer Hindi Medium. \nOn Friday, IANS had contacted Saba, and she had said over phone that “it was a fun show”. \n“Koffee With Karan mein kya kuchch nahi hota (What all does not happen on Koffee With Karan),” Saba asked.

He is not my cup of tea.” \nNext was Bollywood’s ‘serial kisser’ Emraan Hashmi, whom she rejected because she didn’t want “mouth cancer”. This comment hasn’t gone down too well with his fans as Emraan’s son has fought cancer and the actor has been doing his bit for cancer awareness. \nSaba rejected Riteish because since she is an “A-grade actress” in Pakistan, she would want to work only with other A-grade actors, even in India. \nThe host then showed a photograph of Ranbir, whom she could not reject.

But on insistence by the host, she finally turned him down because he “had a ‘chakkar’ (affair) with Deepika Padukone.” \nFinally, the photograph of Salman was shown, and Saba turned him down for being ‘chhichhora’ (indecent), and for not knowing how to dance. \nSaba’s video appeared during ongoing tension between India and Pakistan after the Uri army camp attack in September last year, and at a time when Pakistani artistes are not being entertained in India due to a ban imposed by certain right-wing outfits. \nSaba, who made her acting debut with the PTV Home drama Main Aurat Hoon in 2004, is popular in Pakistan for essaying leading roles in hit dramas Dhoop Mein Andhera Hai, Jinnah Ke Naam and Uraan. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T23:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T20:43:19.459+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
