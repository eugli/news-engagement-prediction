The gatherings at the shrine started on Sunday and included a protest walk and a dance performance by classical dancer and social activist Sheema Kermani. \nClad in an orange-coloured dress that symbolised the attire of the Sufis, Kermani danced in the shrine’s compound while Nanga Fakir, a group of folk singers from Badin, sang songs praising the Sufi saint. “Oh lal meri pat rakhio bhala jhooley lalan“ and “Tera Sehwan rahe abad”, they sang. \nKermani told reporters the idea behind her dance \"was to tell the perpetrators of terrorism that nobody can stop dance and music. These are part of our heritage, our culture.\" \nThe artist said she intended to perform ‘dhamaal’, the ecstatic spiritual dance which the saint used to perform in his life. Dhamaal is perfromed to the beat of the ‘naghara’, a percussion instrument, and scheduled after the Maghrib or evening prayer. \nThe suicide bomber struck on February 16 when a large number of people were performing dhamaal at the shrine. The attack was claimed by the Islamic State, which views Sufism as heretical. Sindh governor Mohammad Zubair described the province as the “land of Sufis” and said the terrorists had deliberately targeted the devotees of the shrine. \nKermani, whose parents hailed from Lucknow and Hyderabad, is proficient in several Indian classical dance forms, including Kathak, Bharatanatyam and Odissi. The dancer, who has received threats from extremists in the past, said the message she had for attackers was that people who do not like the culture of shrines do not have to visit these places. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:12:16.961+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
