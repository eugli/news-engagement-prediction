So we thought the best thing we could do is try and organise a couple of trucks to bring some hay up,\" he said. \nMore than 50 trucks had brought hay to the region by Saturday. \n\"Those couple of trucks, through enormous generosity from everyone, has turned into a massive event,\" said Mr Manwaring. Affected family overwhelmed by support \nThe fodder donations would make a big difference for the Wentworth-Brown family whose whole property was burnt out. \n\"In a nutshell, [we lost] everything. Other than the important things, the kids,\" said Chris Wentworth-Brown. \nThe Wentworth-Brown family said they had received incredible support from their local community and the wider farming sector, including the hay drive. \n\"It is very overwhelming, look at these trucks rolling down here,\" said Mr Wentworth-Brown. \nThe family had temporarily moved in with friends who also live near Dunedoo. \nThey were expecting about 100 bails of hay to be donated to their property, where many fire-affected people had off-loaded their stock. \n\"We have just opened our arms to let people in and bring their animals,\" said Lisa Clisby. \n\"So far we have got 15 dogs and 14 horses there at the moment as well as, we have got sheep and cattle ourselves, so we have a bit of mixture.\" \nMs Clisby said she was amazed by how far people had travelled from to bring fodder. \n\"I just can't believe it, it has been so overwhelming.\" Riverina truck driver humbled by grateful community \nRon Wilson would have travelled almost 1,000 kilometres by the time he got back to his home in the New South Wales Riverina region. \nHe had travelled from Ladysmith near Wagga Wagga to bring hay donated from people in the area. \nHe said it was imperative the rural sector supported the fire-affected farmers during this time. \n\"I thought I would help these poor buggers out because some of them have been burnt right out and most of the money I earn, it all comes off the land,\" said Mr Wilson. \nHe said the number of people who showed gratitude surprised some of the drivers on the hay drive. \n\"It was surprising, the amount of cars that passed us and had their thumbs up to say thank you. That sort of gets to you, and you think then they appreciate you, which I know they do.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T15:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T11:02:24.273+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
