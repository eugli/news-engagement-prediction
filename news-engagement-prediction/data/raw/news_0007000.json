Ovarian, womb and post-menopausal breast cancer all happen more often to people carrying too much weight.”\nHe urged women to make lifestyle changes to reduce the chance of cancer.\n“Taking regular exercise and avoiding too many treats is a good way to reduce your risk. We all know it's not always easy to maintain a healthy weight, but even small steps can help,” he said.\nThe statistics show that cases of breast cancer are expected to rise from 54,800 in 2014 to more than 71,000 in 2035. Meanwhile, ovarian cancer cases will jump from almost 7,400 to 10,500 while lung cancer cases rise from from 21,600 to almost 30,000.\nMore than eight million people die from cancer each year globablly - more than AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis put together, the charity warned.\nBreast, prostate, lung and bowel cancer are the most common cancers, accounting for more than half of new cases of cancer each year in the UK.\nLast year a study suggested that the number of Britons set to develop cancer because they are overweight will treble within two decades.\nCakes at work are becoming a daily occurrence, particularly in larger offices C urrently around 18,000 Britons a year develop cancer because they are overweight , a figure which is predicted to reach 56,000 people a year by 2035.\nOncologists have warned that obesity is poised to overtake smoking as the leading preventable cause of cancer, with too many people “eating their way towards an early death.”\nSpiralling rates of obesity meant that cancer – once seen as a disease of old age – was now increasingly being diagnosed up to two decades earlier than in the past, doctors have warned.\nSir Harpal Kumar, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said: \"These new figures reveal the huge challenge we continue to face, both in the UK and worldwide.\nEdward Digets tips for dieting success \"Research is at the heart of finding ways to reduce cancer's burden and ensure more people survive, particularly for hard-to-treat cancers where the outlook for patients is still bleak.\n\"We need to keep working hard to reduce the devastating impact cancer can have on so many families.”\n\"With more investment into research, we hope to make big improvements over the next 20 years in diagnosing the disease earlier and improving and developing treatments so that by 2034, three in four people will survive their disease.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T13:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T08:07:29.488+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
