Video by Jen Rynda/Baltimore Sun Media Group (Patti Restivo) \n\"We will always disagree on many significant things. But what we can agree on is having an irenic spirit. A peaceful one. That is what we have to foster,\" McGhee said. \nThe congregation's first lay rabbi, Harry Rosebluh, who died in 2015, gave the Torah to Oseh Shalom nearly 45 years ago. \nShulevitz said some Jewish traditions bar people from other faiths from touching the sacred text. \n\"This is easily the highlight of my career,\" Shulevitz said. \"This is a moment that God is smiling down upon us.\" \nWednesday's restoration with area faith leaders is part of a community-wide project to restore the fading scroll. Future restoration opportunities are scheduled at Oseh Shalom from 3 to 5 p.m. on March 26, April 2, April 23, April 30 and May 7. The project is intended to raise money for the center as it nears its 25th anniversary on Olive Branch Way in Laurel.
