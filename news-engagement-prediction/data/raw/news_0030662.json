Virginia Drive, but the numbers surged on Saturday in response to a national call to \"Defund Planned Parenthood.\" \nAnd that rallying cry, in turn, attracted counterprotesters.

(Ben Torres/Special Contributor) \nOn one side of the clinic’s driveway stood abortion opponents, mostly comprised of groups from Protestant and Catholic churches in the area. They quietly muttered prayers and held rosaries, crucifixes and signs that read “God is the giver of life” and “Babies destroyed here.” \nOn the other side of the driveway stood abortion rights activists allied with the Defend Abortion Access Coalition. They chanted through megaphones and held signs that read “Defend access to abortion” and “Not today Satan.” \nElizabeth Clinton of the coalition said she and other abortion rights activists made a presence in front of the clinic because throughout history, \"rights have been won through protesting.\" \n\"There is an escalating importance for us to come together to defend rights to access abortion,\" she said. \nBut Pastor S. E. Broden, founder of the National Black Pro-Life Coalition, said he came out to the clinic Saturday to pray, like he does every day, because he believes the community is widely misinformed on the realities of abortion. \n\"Social justice begins in the womb,\" Broden said. \"And babies' lives matter in the womb.\" \nOne man strayed from the group of abortion opponents to stand in front of the abortion rights group and shout his own chants at them while pacing the sidewalk in front of them. \n\"We don't know who that is. I've never seen him before,\" said Michael Maloney, an organizer of the group that prays in front of the clinic every Saturday. \"That's not how we do this. We don't yell; we pray quietly.\" \nWhile the yelling match continued, Robert Wetzel, a Protestant youth minister from Forney, and Greg Stevens, a member of the Satanic Temple of Dallas, broke off from their groups and sat together on the grass as they laughed at the scene before them.

Wetzel is a youth minister at a Protestant church in Forney and Stevens is a member of the Satanic Temple of Dallas. (Claire Ballor/Staff) \nFor over half an hour they talked about their opposing views on abortion and creation, while also sharing some common ground: laughing at the shouts from across the street and discussing how easily they sunburn. \nStevens said while they don’t agree on much, “especially not metaphysics,” it was a “wonderful conversation” and they found common ground in their disagreement with the way politics uses issues such as abortion as a “divisive technique to promote other agendas.” \n“We need to be able to talk with people we disagree with,” said Stevens. “At the end of the day, we’re all people.” \nWetzel said he also greatly appreciated the conversation. \n“He’s an awesome guy,” Wetzel said. “This is what it’s about: an open atmosphere to exchange ideas with no animosity, no hatred. These are the only conversations that are going to make a difference.” View Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T05:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T01:21:26.366+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
