In fact, it’s downright inspirational. — Gérald CAPGRAS (@GCapgras) February 16, 2017 Some have even used it to share a political message. ''If Britney survived 2007, we will survive this'' pic.twitter.com/f7xO6oK3Je As for Spears herself, today the star is thriving. She has a successful new album under her belt, and a Vegas residency that has earned north of $100 million .\nSometimes you just have to burn it all down and start again.
