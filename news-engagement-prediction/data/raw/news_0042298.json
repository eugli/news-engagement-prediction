It provides support for almost all Firefox extensions and themes but some features bundled in Firefox are disabled in Pale Moon in order to boost the speed of browsing and decrease resource consumption, namely Accessibility and Parental Controls. User interface When run for the first time, the tool lets you import Options, Bookmarks, History, Passwords and other details from Internet Explorer or Chrome . Pale Moon’s interface resembles the one adopted by Firefox before the major facelift brought by Australis. It retains the same familiar elements and may prove to be a safe alternative for those users who can’t get along with the completely redesigned interface implemented by Firefox with Australis version 29. You are given the freedom to hide or reveal the Menu Bar, Navigation Toolbar, Bookmarks Toolbar, and Status Bar, or conceal all of them for a cleaner browsing experience. Plus, you can add or remove items by dragging them to or from the toolbars. The web browser enables you to work with multiple tabs, pin your favorite ones, as well as customize the status bar. The tab bar remains included in the UI just below the other toolbars, a design aspect not retained by Firefox and Chrome. Key features Several powerful features are included in the package for delivering a pleasant and secure browsing experience. You may navigate on the Internet using the private mode which automatically deletes all traces left behind when you close the current session. What’s more, you may activate a full screen view, create bookmarks, check out the history with all accessed websites, install add-ons, change the default search engine (DuckDuckGo which adopts a no-tracking privacy policy), and block popup windows. Lasts but not least, you can clear your recent history, remove individual cookies, sync data so you can access your history, bookmarks, passwords and open tabs across all your devices, as well as work with a download manager. Bottom line All in all, Pale Moon proves to be a reliable web browser that removes several unnecessary features from Firefox for delivering fast browsing speed and implements a user-friendly interface, which retains several traditional design concepts removed from Firefox’s new UI. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS Pentium 4 or Athlon 64 or later CPU (a CPU with SSE2 support) 256MB RAM 150 MB HDD space New in Pale Moon 27.1.1: Implemented a fix in media handling to prevent crashes with concurrent videos and/or rapidly starting/stopping video playback in the browser. Fixed the way the Adobe Flash plugin is detected to prevent confusion with other plugins that identify themselves as \"Flash\" (e.g. VLC). Windows: Solved stability issues caused by the release build process, resulting in unexpected behavior (e.g. hangups).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:26:33.549+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
