One is in custody. \nMalaysia has denied North Korea's request for the body to be handed over to its embassy directly, saying it would be released to the next of kin, though none has come forward. \nThe KCNA dispatch accused Malaysia of breaking international law by conducting autopsies on a person bearing a diplomatic passport. \n(Reporting by Jack Kim and Christine Kim; Editing by Chris Reese and Grant McCool) \n- Reuters \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T15:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:05:14.945+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
