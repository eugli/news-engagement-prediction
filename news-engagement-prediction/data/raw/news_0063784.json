After he placed last in his fantasy football league, Chicagoland’s Ryan Stew received a bus stop ad generously paid for by his league buddies. DNA Info reports : \nThe ad sells Stew, originally of southwest suburban Tinley Park, as a “respected educator” and “2016 fantasy football loser” who “perspires ambitiously.” It even includes a way for interested ladies to contact Stew—email him or follow him on Instagram as @TrySomeStew. \nIt seems like the ad is somewhere between a prank and a kind gesture, as Stew is newly single after a six-year relationship. His friends were hoping he’d get about 100 or so responses, but the ad at Milwaukee and Damen appears to have taken on a life of its own. Many women have posed for pictures next to it, but it’s unsure as of yet if the ad has resulted in actual dates for Stew. \nAfter losing his girlfriend and his home (moving back in with Mom post-breakup), it’s remarkable that the 30-year-old social science teacher still has a sense of humor about it all. He’s thanking his friends for the assist, even though, he told The Daily Southtown , “I wish they chose a better picture. That was like six years ago, and I’ve lost a ton of weight. My friends, after all the smack talk I give them, this is nice. This shows they’re thinking of me. This shows they really care.” Who needs love when you have friends like that? — Logan Malloy (@LoganFXM) February 14, 2017 \nSubmit your Great Job, Internet tips here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:16:28.757+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
