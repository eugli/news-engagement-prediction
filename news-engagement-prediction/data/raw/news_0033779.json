I'm trying to get that whole walk like a boy, keep-my-hips-and-head-contained thing down. Usually, it's always super-sexy for me, and this is like fashion fashion.\" Graham went on to say that although Kors isn’t the first mainstream designer to include diverse bodies in a runway presentation—Christian Siriano cast five plus-sized models last season and ten this one, and Prabal Garung just announced a plus-sized collaboration with Lane Bryant —it's still a momentous occasion. \"Fashion isn't such a small world anymore. It's broadening into all kinds of beauty. It's about race, it's about size, it's about age. And when a designer isn't just talking about it, but they're putting their money where their mouth is? I think that’s the most beautiful thing,\" she said.

Well guess what? Michael Kors just called—and Graham answered with aplomb.
