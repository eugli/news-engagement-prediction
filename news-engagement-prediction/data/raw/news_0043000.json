(ABC: Barbara Miller) \nAneela Younis, a former telco manager from Pakistan, is also a participant, hoping to bring Pakistani street food to Australia. \nMs Younis had a comfortable life at home in Lahore; a good job, domestic help, and family at hand to help care for the couple's young daughter. \nWhen she finally resettled in Australia 18 months ago, she struggled to find work in her field. \n\"The most common question I got was 'do you have local experience?'\" she said. \n\"Unfortunately I don't have local experience and it took me a long time to get into the job market and still I couldn't find the job that I am looking for, as I was in upper management over there but I have to start here from the entry level.\" \nShe and her husband are now refining what may soon be their business product, in their kitchen at Homebush. \nThe dish is called Anda; a Pakistani egg burger that consists of a soft patty in a bun, covered in sauce and topped with a spicy omelette. \n\"I'm a little bit anxious at how the people are going to like it, whether they are going to like the taste,\" she said. \n\"So that fear factor is there, but still we are positive.\" \nMr Iftikhar said Catalysr participants had now started road-testing their ideas and refining their business models. \n\"One of the things that we are trying to instil in their minds is that they should be trying to solve a problem, rather than just going out and creating something and finding out that no-one needs it,\" he said. \nWatch the story tonight on Lateline at 9.30pm (AEDT) on ABC News 24 or 10.30pm on ABC TV.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T06:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:52:46.608+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
