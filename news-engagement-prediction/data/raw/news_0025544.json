Image: Getty Images/Spencer Platt 2017-02-14 03:48:56 UTC \nEven a presidential tweet can't save Ivanka Trump's shoes. \nThe Trump name is vanishing from store shelves and shopping sites as retailers distance themselves from the first family's business empire. \nSears and its subsidiary Kmart became the latest big shopping chains to pull away from the Trump organization this weekend, Reuters reported. The two stores said they would end online sales of 31 items from Trump Home, the brand's line of household furnishings. \nA jargon-bogged company statement attributed the decision to a \"streamlining effort\" focused on the retailers' \"most profitable items.\" \nThe move follows similar announcements from Nordstrom, Nieman Marcus and Belk last week. Several other stores, like T.J. Maxx, Marshall's , Macy's , Walmart-owned Jet.com and Burlington , have quietly whittled down their Trump-branded selections, according to various reports. \nNone of the latter group have responded to multiple requests for comment. \nThe stores that have publicly admitted to their actions have each insisted that it was a plain business decision rather than a political stand. \nBut all have been subject to a long-running boycott campaign called #GrabYourWallet , which targets any consumer company with business or political ties to the president or his family. \nIvanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner. \nImage: Evan Vucci/AP/REX/Shutterstock \nThat movement has gained particular traction in recent weeks as the Trump administration has steamrolled through a controversial agenda. \nIt may or may not be a coincidence that sales of Ivanka Trump clothes and shoes at Nordstrom dropped most dramatically from the previous year in the three weeks after #GrabYourWallet began last October, according to internal data leaked to the Wall Street Journal . Either way,the report traces an ongoing decline, even as the chain's overall sales have grown. \nOur Twitter egg-in-chief evidently sees the decisions as political nonetheless, as do his most fervent followers. The president accused the department store of treating his daughter \"so unfairly\" last week in his daily scattershot of social media outbursts. My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom . She is a great person — always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 \nPerhaps that's why many of the retailers that have followed Nordstrom's lead have been so reluctant to confirm their stocking changes. \nRetailers, and consumer companies in general, have had to navigate a fraught political landscape as the president's detractors and supporters have turned shopping into an act of protest. \nHere's a list of retailers that have taken Trump-related action: \nNordstrom's - The department store said early this month that it would drop Ivanka Trump products from its stores. \nNeiman Marcus - The upscale department store followed Nordstrom's lead the next day and dropped Ivanka Trump's jewelry line from its website and some stores. \nT.J. Maxx and Marshall's - Employees at the discount retailers were told to throw out signs and promotional materials related to Ivanka Trump's brand last week, according to a memo obtained by the New York Times . \nBelk - The 300-location department store announced that it would remove Ivanka Trump products from its website last Thursday. \nJet.com - Mic reported last week that the Walmart-owned shopping site had removed some of its Trump products. \nMacy's - Business Insider reported that the number of Ivanka Trump products available on the department store's site dropped from 45 to 25 this week. \nBurlington - Trump Home products mysteriously disappeared from the retailer's site over the weekend.
