However, a bogey on 10th meant she was again one-over. But four birdies in next holes saw her end the day with 70.\nOf the two other Indian girls - Vani Kapoor (73) was tied-12th and Amandeep Drall (78) was tied-55th.\nVani was three-over on front nine, but three birdies in last four holes saw her end at even par 73. Amandeep had nine pars on back nine of the course after starting on 10th and then she had a birdie on second to go one-under. Then over next seven holes she had four bogeys and one double.\n\"I am really happy with my start to the tournament. I made six birdies so I obviously created enough chances. I did make a few mistakes and I will be trying hard not to do that tomorrow,\" Aditi said.\nThe highest-ranked player in the field this week, Aditi said the warm conditions were not that different to playing at home in Bangalore.\n\"I love playing golf in the hot weather. I enjoy it much more than the cold but this is a little more humidity than I am used to,\" the two-time winner on Ladies European Tour in 2016 said.\nJust one shot behind the leaders lies a group of players including LPGA star Katherine Kirk, Gold Coast amateur Rebecca Kay and Thai stars Pannarat Thanapolboonyaras and Prima Thammaraks.\nLaura Davies also started poorly but battled back to shoot a one-over par round of 74.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T13:20:14.557+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
