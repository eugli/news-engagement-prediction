Oulson's wife Nicole was struck in the left hand as she tried to help her husband. Curtis Reeves appears in court in February of 2014, one month after the shooting death of Chad Oulson. (Andy Jones/ASSOCIATED PRESS) \nThe Stand Your Ground law allows Florida residents to use deadly force to defend their lives or their property. If a judge determines the incident meets the proper criteria, Reeves will be immune from criminal prosecution and civil action. Otherwise, he will be tried for second-degree murder. \nRetired Fla. police captain charged with fatal movie theater shooting released on bail \nGeorge Zimmerman avoided prison time for the killing of Trayvon Martin five years ago after using the Stand Your Ground defense. \n\"I can't imagine that when the legislature drew this up they intended it to apply to someone killing someone for having popcorn thrown in their face,\" Nicole Oulson's lawyer TJ Grimaldi told the Daily News on Tuesday. Chad and Nicole Oulson were at the movies when he was fatally shot three years ago. (Facebook) \nThe hearing began Monday before a Pinellas-Pasco Circuit judge and is expected to last approximately two weeks. \nThe defense is arguing that the 74-year-old Reeves, who they say was battling severe health problems, had reasons to fear for his life. Reeves, a former Tampa police officer, was 71 at the time time of the shooting on Jan. 13, 2014. \nRetired Fla. cop who shot texting moviegoer is 'confident' of innocence \n\"This case is about perception,\" Reeves' lawyer Dino Michaels said Monday, according to the Tampa Bay Times . \"It's important we understand who Mr. Reeves is.\" \nReeves' family members took the stand on Monday to testify about his failing health. A doctor testified about the medical problems people usually develop when they got older. \n\"They are trying to paint a picture of a polite, feeble old man who did nothing but ask a man to put his cell phone away,\" Grimaldi told The News. \"It's literally his only angle to not be charged with a crime.\" Surveillance video of the Florida movie theater shows Curtis Reeves. (TheTawniDilly via YouTube) \nMatthew Reeves, the defendant's son and a police officer himself, was in the theater at the time of the shooting. He testified he saw a flash from the gunshot after hearing his dad say something to similar to \"get out of my face,\" according to the newspaper. \nFormer Fla. cop in deadly theater shooting was ALSO texting: officials \nMatthew Reeves said the lights came on, and he saw Chad Oulson take \"an exaggerated step down,\" according to the paper. \n\"Once he stepped back, I was able to see my father behind him,\" Matthew Reeves testified, according to the Tampa Bay Times. \nWith News Wire Services", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:10:00.660+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
