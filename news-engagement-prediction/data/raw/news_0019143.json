Here is her story:\n\"I didn’t want to be a mother. I was eighteen. We weren’t in love. I had goals I wanted to accomplish. So I made the hardest decision of my life. It’s not legal here. So I researched it on the Internet. I did it myself. In my room. If things had gone wrong, I could have died. Seeing it come out of me was the worst moment of my life. And I couldn’t tell anyone. Not even my parents. So I carried the secret with me. I felt like this thing was always in my chest, but it was stuck there. All day I’d act normal. Then at night I’d go to my room and cry.\"\nThe post has since been shared widely as an example of why legal abortion is so important. Were this the case in Argentina, she wouldn't have needed to risk her life, and could have received counseling from trained professionals both before and after her abortion. She may well have felt less stigmatized, and alone. And the anecdote struck a chord with many women in the United States, where congressional Republicans in America are currently working on restricting abortion rights , and President Trump's nominee for the US Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch , is widely expected to further hamper women's rights (and access to healthcare specifically). While he has never ruled directly on abortion rights, he has previously ruled in favor of denying employees coverage for contraception , and argued in his 2006 book that “all human beings are intrinsically valuable and the intentional taking of human life by private persons is always wrong,” a position which is being widely read as pro-life.\nFollow Diana on Twitter .\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below", "external_links": ["http://www.womenonwaves.org/en/page/4934/argentina--abortion-law", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BQEfzFMD_q6/", "https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/", "http://www.twitter.com/BrukDiana", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/heartbeat-bills-bad-science_us_587e7435e4b01cdc64c8199b"], "published": "2017-02-08T17:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T05:30:37.680+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
