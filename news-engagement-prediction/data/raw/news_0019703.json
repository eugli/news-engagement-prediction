she asked. \nMr Curry said people did not expect to make a win. \n\"I don't think people generally expect to win when they play but what they are doing is buying a form of entertainment,\" he said. \n\"They are enjoying that form of entertainment, it's no different to me going to the movies - whether it's a good movie or a bad movie - and buying an ice cream.\" \nTasmanian author and historian James Boyce urged the committee not to ignore the state's two casinos in the debate on whether pokies should exist in pubs and clubs. \nMr Boyce has written a book on the pokies, which is due to be released soon. \n\"I would plead with you to look at the issue of the casino,\" Dr Boyce told the committee. \nMr Boyce said as soon as the casino was licensed to operate high intensity poker machines in 1994 it turned into a \"giant pokies barn\". \n\"They need to be treated as poker machine venues.\" \nHe said the regulation of poker machines was failing vulnerable people, and there was a \"tale of two Tasmanias\". \n\"We have this vibrant growth with many things happening in Tasmania, and many people benefiting,\" he said. \"But we have this large group being left behind.\" Fears pubs could go broke \nMeanwhile, Dixon Hotel Group director Peter Dixon told the committee pubs in regional areas would struggle to stay viable without the revenue from poker machines. \n\"We speak from the heart on this, I've had 40 years in this industry and have invested in country areas and I can tell you the vast majority of our places would be broke without the pokies,\" Mr Dixon said. \n\"You get into the areas where we deal like Scottsdale, New Norfolk, Longford, Exeter, George Town - most of those venues haven't seen a tourist.\" \nMr Dixon's group operates 35 pubs, 30 of which are in regional Tasmania. \n\"The bottom line is they are doing in tough, pokies aren't a big part of the business but that helps us buy.\" First posted February 08, 2017 14:04:33 Top Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T10:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T05:56:57.853+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
