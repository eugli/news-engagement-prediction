Life after farming accident \nFor 12 months Mr Chapman struggled to deal with the aftermath of the accident that left him without his arm. \nEventually, his friends dragged him out of the house and he became involved in a young farmer's organisation and was later asked to be part of a farm safety campaign. \n\"They wanted a disabled farmer who didn't mind telling their story about having an accident on the farm and how it affects your life,\" he said. \nMr Chapman now goes around telling his story to other farmers in the hope he can change attitudes to farm safety. \n\"My aim really is to make safety sexy once again,\" he said. \n\"I say that for a bit of a laugh and it gets people in a bit of a smile but really it's about changing that attitude.\" Taking a look at Australian farms \nMr Chapman stopped by Jigsaw Farms near Hamilton, in south-west Victoria where he was impressed by owner Mark Wootton's approach to safety. \n\"The guy's a fantastic farmer,\" he said. \n\"The health and safety side of it means a lot to him and it's actually part of his business — it's not an add-on.\" \nIn the Wootton's shearing shed, the height of the floor is adjusted to avoid back injuries and the floor is sloping to make it easier to manoeuvre sheep. \n\"It's a nice place to work [and] you're not worried about dangerous machinery or whatever else,\" Mr Chapman said. \nSome risk factors are common around the world; things like working with animals, machinery and quadbikes. \nBut farm safety in Australia throws up unique challenges Mr Chapman has not encountered in the UK. \n\"It's massive, the size and scale of farming and just the country itself is your biggest asset, but it's also one of the biggest problems when it comes to farm safety,\" he said. \n\"If they [farmers] want to be unsafe and do things that are risky, there's no one there to tell them they shouldn't.\" Safety factors unique to Australia \nMr Chapman points out other factors unique to Australia are skin cancer and dangerous animals. \n\"There are things you guys have got here that we don't have in the UK — one of which is a big orange thing in the sky,\" he said. \n\"Also, you've got snakes and spiders that we don't have.\" \nDespite these challenges Mr Chapman said the same principles of farm safety could be applied around the world. \n\"Farmers are unique people but then, we are the same around the world,\" he said. \n\"I've learnt that farmers like hearing from other farmers; they don't like hearing from organisations like WorkCover.\" \nMr Chapman said another important aspect to getting farm safety right was to make it practical. \n\"If it's difficult or gets in the way of another job, it won't work,\" he said. \nAccidents usually occur when farmers are rushed, maybe something has gone wrong or the weather is against them and to prevent farm accidents, Mr Chapman's advice is to slow down. \n\"Take a breath and have a look at what you're about to do before you jump into it,\" he said. \n\"It's that balance between needing to get the job done and being able to come home and see your wife and kids afterwards.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T05:15:28.206+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
