That’s up from 34 last year.\n“Three or four?” I said to Michelle Kessler-Sanders, the company’s president, not sure I’d heard her correctly. I knew the collection business had been insignificant for years, so no figure would have surprised me.\n“No, 34.”\nThat’s global . Imagine going to all the trouble and expense of staging four runway shows a year (two men’s, two women’s), paying those salaries, dressing celebrities, doing the whole whoopty doo — and it meant nothing. Just smoke and mirrors.\nThe objective of that strategy was to generate buzz to sell underwear and other lower-priced Calvin Klein products, and apparently it was very successful. But it must have been demoralizing, too. People want to feel they’re being challenged, that their work matters, and doesn’t wind up in a puddle of, at best, 34 stores.\nI remember the early days of Francisco Costa, the brand’s previous women’s designer, and how he fought with management to get a sample room opened in New York, so that his staff wasn’t working long distance from Italy, with uneven results. Eventually, he won that battle, but in a sense lost the war. His collections, while technically always interesting, ceased to be relevant as the disconnect between the collection line and the rest of the business widened.\nThen came Raf Simons. In six months, he has made dramatic changes, on all fronts — advertising, marketing, art direction, and, of course, design. He asked his friend, the artist Sterling Ruby, to create a new showroom (a vivid splatter effect on walls and columns), where the dinner was held. I suspect that if Simons wants something, it’s green lights all the way — and you can bet he’s going to be itchy to get stuff done now.\nAlmost certainly, one of those projects will be a redo of the Calvin Klein flagship on Madison. It’s a stunning building, by John Pawson, but do you enter it with any sense of anticipation or reward? In a way, it’s emblematic of the brand’s past smoke-and-mirrors image.\nYesterday’s Calvin Klein show didn’t just raise the bar for New York Fashion Week; it exposed fundamental weaknesses. The lack of talent and ambition. A show schedule that is drawn out, zapping energy and heightening the impression that NYFW is diluted.\nJason Wu, showing at the fancy-pants St. Regis, really missed an opportunity to show off his young tailoring. Instead he focused on drippy knits in unflattering tones, silk prints, and asymmetrically hemmed dresses that we’ve kinda seen before. As usual, Adam Selman’s denim separates were clever and feminine, with big red roses, but even he seemed bored with the rest of his offerings, including reworked shirt dresses.\nView The Jason Wu Collection Photo: Imaxtree View the Adam Selman Collection Photo: Imaxtree Far more thoughtful and fresh was the R13 collection, by Chris Leba. His awkward-looking models, in drain-piped tweeds, big ratty sweaters, and some superb leather and shearling jackets have stayed with me. His turned-around dress shirts, with collars raised like a cleric’s, reminded me of early Veronique Branquinho, the Antwerp designer, but with an ambivalent American vibe.\nView the R13 Collection Photo: Imaxtree Yesterday, people were debating whether Simons had been wise to go with so much Americana. To be sure, it seems an easy theme, and we’ve seen so many flag sweaters and American shlock send-ups (Jeremy Scott’s rather brilliant Jesus pants last night, for example).\nBut doesn’t it depend on how you interpret it? And if this isn’t an ideal moment to interpret American culture, then when is? Someone like Scott will always go for literal references, and that’s fine — that’s his thing. He’s so good at mining the material of American trash that you don’t know whether to cry with laughter or cry with sadness.\nView the Jeremy Scott Collection Photo: Imaxtree But I think there’s an enormous opportunity, perhaps exposed by Simons, to begin interpreting the tensions and rifts and hopes colliding on the American stage. As we know, it is already happening in other mediums, like comedy and television. The expression doesn’t have to be obvious. Indeed, it should be subtle. But the point is the industry now has more than one incentive to make a greater show of itself — or risk becoming irrelevant.\nTags: cut homepage lede fashions fashion cathy horyn Fashion’s American Moment Most Viewed Stories This Gym Owner Was Not Happy Ivanka Trump Took Her Class Unannounced Sears, Kmart Dump Ivanka Trump Products From Online Stores First They Marched, Now More Than 13,000 Women Are Planning to Run for Office Cool Kids Spend 63 Minutes Politely Ignoring Kendall Jenner at V Magazine Party The Most Anticipated Fashion Show in Decades Turned Out to Be Brilliant Stan Smith Knows You Think He’s Just a Sneaker How to Help a Friend Who’s Going Through Something Horrible 11 Erotic Accessories You Can Buy Discreetly on Amazon Hardly Any New Yorkers Came Out To Hear Katy Perry’s New Song A Couple Broke Up in Burger King’s Instagram Comments The Latest on the Cut Yesterday at 10:21 p.m. Alexander Wang Threw an All-Black Kegger The show was the after-party.\nYesterday at 7:58 p.m. Watch the Alexander Wang Livestream Enjoy!\nYesterday at 4:15 p.m. The Best Street Style From New York Fashion Week High-waisted jeans, frayed hems, bright-yellow heels.\nYesterday at 4:10 p.m. Tiffany Trump Was Front Row at New York Fashion Week She was with her mother, Marla Maples.\nYesterday at 3:41 p.m. Sears, Kmart Dump Ivanka Trump Products From Online Stores Plus, more details on those Nordstrom numbers.\nYesterday at 3:36 p.m. Fashion’s American Moment Raf Simons’s Calvin Klein collection shows the way toward interpreting this tumultuous era.\nYesterday at 3:17 p.m. Cool Kids Spend 63 Minutes Politely Ignoring Kendall Jenner at V Magazine Party Inside the very exclusive Kardashian party.\nYesterday at 2:37 p.m. Pregnant Ciara Dances to Whitney Houston in This Instagram Video Ciara is every woman … It’s all in her.\nYesterday at 1:24 p.m. Margaret Atwood Says Donald Trump’s Presidency Boosted The Handmaid’s Tale Sales “You are seeing a bubbling up of it now.”\nYesterday at 1:24 p.m. All the Political Statements the Fashion Crowd Is Making During NYFW From the white bandanna to slogan-printed shirts.\nYesterday at 1:10 p.m. See 30 Years in the Making of the #MyCalvins Instagram Craze All of Calvin Klein’s underwear ads since Marky Mark.\nYesterday at 12:48 p.m. Neutrals and a Red Lip Is the Ultimate Combination Our favorite outfit from the second day of New York Fashion Week.\nYesterday at 12:43 p.m. Planned Parenthood Counter-Protest Drowns Out ‘Defund Planned Parenthood’ Rally The ‘Defund Planned Parenthood’ rally was outnumbered.\nYesterday at 11:59 a.m. Dressing Like a Gucci Model Is Bound to Get You Noticed Today’s Golden Peacock Award winner.\nYesterday at 11:55 a.m. 2016 Was a Good Year for Adele, Beyoncé, and Few Other Women in Music In an age of pop-music queens, women created just a small fraction of last year’s popular music.\nYesterday at 11:39 a.m. Fashion Week Social-Media Moments From the Cut’s Editors, Day 3 A furry runway, Gigi Hadid, Raf Simons, and more.\nYesterday at 11:36 a.m. Grace Coddington and Raf Simons Partied Last Night at NYFW Plus: Jason Wu, Joan Smalls, and Diane Kruger.\nYesterday at 10:47 a.m. Behind the Scenes With Kate Spade at the Russian Tea Room Also: Jason Wu at the St. Regis and VFILES in Times Square.\nYesterday at 9:58 a.m. Whoopi Goldberg Gets Really Frank About the Effects of Aging Specifically, aging and pubes.\nYesterday at 9:20 a.m. A Couple Broke Up in Burger King’s Instagram Comments Those Whoppers probably weren’t worth it.
