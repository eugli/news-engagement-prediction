Mr. de Blasio dropped the groundhog, and it later died. The next year, a layer of plexiglass separated him and the groundhog. Credit Michael Nagle for The New York Times For years, the mayor of New York endured the spectacle of Groundhog Day, trekking out to the Staten Island Zoo to see if Staten Island Chuck would see his shadow. Similarly, mayors have typically grinned through the jokey banter of the weigh-in before the Nathan’s hot-dog-eating contest , a ceremony held at City Hall since the 1990s. But as he enters his fourth year in office, facing re-election in the fall, Mayor Bill de Blasio has seemed to declare an unofficial end to the most pompous of rites. He will not attend the Groundhog Day ceremony on Thursday, the second straight year he has missed the event. Likewise, he has not attended the Nathan’s weigh-in since 2014, his first year in office and the last time it was held at City Hall. (It now takes place at Brooklyn Borough Hall.) And even the most venerable of New York City events, the New Year’s Eve ball drop, has suffered the mayor’s lack of enthusiasm for acting as a city booster. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “I’m not quite sure why a million people want to stand in the freezing cold for long, long periods of time, but they do,” Mr. de Blasio said in December, shortly before the ball drop. In recent weeks, he has also decided not to go to more serious events. He did not go to the scene of a Long Island Rail Road derailment, defending the decision by saying the injuries had been minor. His staff weighed and ultimately decided against his making an appearance on Saturday at Kennedy Airport, where demonstrators had gathered to protest an immigration order by President Trump. But on the lighter fare that attends the office of mayor, Mr. de Blasio has often taken a certain pride in eschewing some of the appearances that his predecessors made, sometimes grudgingly, sometimes with great enthusiasm. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, for his part, effectively began the mayoral tradition of attending the Nathan’s weigh-in, asking organizers if he could join them after learning that they had been holding the event outside City Hall.
