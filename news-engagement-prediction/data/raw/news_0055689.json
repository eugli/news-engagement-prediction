But then you try something on and it’s either impossibly small or it drowns you. \nWhich is exactly what happened to shopper Marianne Grey, who ordered a dress from H&M in her usual size 12. \nShe tried the dress on, found that it was too small and returned it to the store, where she tried on another dress. \nAnd then another. And another. Eventually, after going four sizes up from her actual dress size, she managed to find a dress that fit her. \nMarianne wrote on H&M’s Facebook page to convey her confusion about the incident. \nH&M responded that this might be a ‘labeling’ issue – but if it’s a labeling issue that doesn’t really explain the number of complaints about the exact same issue on their Facebook page. \nNo-one is suggesting that H&M is the only store that struggles with this issue, but I think we can all agree that it needs to be sorted out. \nOn the lighter end of the scale, it’s frustrating not to know what size you need to order online. \nOn the darker side of things, it’s not great for your body image to constantly think you’ve lost or gained weight, when what’s actually happened is that a shop as completely inconsistant sizing.
