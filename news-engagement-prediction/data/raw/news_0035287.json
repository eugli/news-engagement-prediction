In countries such as Senegal and Tunisia, women have made major gains in their struggle for equal rights, and in Liberia and South Sudan women have been at the forefront of efforts to promote peace and reconciliation. While some of these movements have been influenced by international feminism and external donors, African women themselves are also increasingly shaping the global struggle for women’s rights, particularly in areas such as political representation and peace-building. Composed of works by African authors who are themselves members of the activist groups, this collection represents the only comprehensive and up-to-date overview of women’s movements in contemporary Africa. Drawing on case studies and fresh empirical material from across the continent, the contributors challenge the prevailing assumption that notions of women’s rights have trickled down from the global north to the south, showing instead that these movements have above all been shaped by the unique experiences and concerns of the local women involved. Review Quotes Sondra Hale, UCLA (Emerita) “This compact volume on women’s activism, by many of the most outstanding scholars in the field, is among the best and most useful I have seen. The editors, bolstered by excellent contributions, turn conventional wisdom about African women on its head.” Josephine Beoku-Betts, Florida Atlantic University \n“This book is distinctive for its critical analysis on issues around African women’s movements and mobilizations. The contributors represent scholarship and activism from diverse regions, and their work broadens our understanding of current African feminist discourses.” Kathleen Fallon, Stony Brook University “Coming from African scholars, this captivating book makes a much-needed contribution to the current literature. Not only does it provide new perspectives and insights, but it also highlights the diversity of activism across the continent. This is a must-read.” Wanjiku Kabira, University of Nairobi, Kenya “Harnesses women’s voices and experiences across Africa to help build a common heritage of protest and activism, which is normally left out of histories of the struggles of African states. It is a must read for all those interested in knowing what African women have been doing and continue to do in the African continent.” For more information, or to order this book, please visit http://www.press.uchicago.edu Google preview here", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T06:27:57.678+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
