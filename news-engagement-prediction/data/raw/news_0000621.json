Credit Vanessa Mckeown for The New York Times The growing season never ends here in Los Angeles. Even in the depths of winter, I can read about, obsess over, order and plant new seeds all within a matter of weeks. Because that’s when the seed catalogs arrive, stuffed into mailboxes around the solstice, hitting like a blast of warm air: lists of many hundreds of different fruits, vegetables and flowers. As the lengthening days start tipping toward spring, I pore over these catalogs, reading them cover to cover: There are multihued carrots and beets, cucumbers shaded yellow, orange and rust red; there’s lettuce that’s harvested, curiously, for its stems, and rutabagas that grow to be the size of small children. It is the closest I get in my adult life to the feeling of reading the Sharper Image catalog as a 10-year-old. On one hand, seed catalogs are vessels for the sort of dry and practical information gardeners and farmers need — U.S.D.A. plant-hardiness-zone numbers, days to maturity, yield and crop size. But smuggled inside these booklets, along with the awkward photos of farmers posing next to comically large crops, are tiny narratives that manage to encompass nearly the entirety of human history and the vast complexity of American identity. You can read about — and buy seeds for — the crops Thomas Jefferson farmed at Monticello. You choose among beans that have been cultivated in North America since before Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic and others, like those carried by Cherokee Indians along the Trail of Tears, colored by the horrors that followed his arrival. There are seeds for Origanum syriacum, a relative of oregano mentioned in the Bible, which grows wild across the rocky hills of Israel and Palestine and is used in the spice blend za’atar that seasons cuisine throughout the Middle East. Many of these vegetables have managed to persist for centuries, only to become nearly obsolete — if not lost altogether — thanks to matters of both technology and taste. With a globalized food chain, there’s less of a need for tomatoes that can be picked in August and stored well into winter. We prefer candy-sweet corn to the older varieties, which get starchier by the hour after the ears come off the stalk. Garlic varieties available from the seed company W. Atlee Burpee & Co. Georgia Crystal Kettle River Giant Viola Francese Elephant Music Ajo Rojo Translyvania Heirloom vegetables may have recently come back in vogue, but seed companies have played an important role in preserving them, selling them by mail for decades. Of course, calling a vegetable an heirloom is akin to calling a band “indie”: It doesn’t mean anything in particular, and while it alludes to a certain aesthetic or feeling, the designation is hardly a guarantee of quality. Generally speaking, heirlooms are both open-pollinated (meaning they can be regrown from saved seeds) and old, although there’s no real consensus on how old. Many put the line around the middle of the 20th century. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story If the notion of what an heirloom vegetable is remains vague in the general sense, seed catalogs are proof of how wondrous it can be in the specific. Consider a pink tomato called Aunt Lou’s Underground Railroad, which is said to have been carried by a slave, his name lost to history, who won his freedom as he escaped out of Kentucky and into Ripley, Ohio. It was impossible to know what kind of life he would find on the other side of the Mason-Dixon, but he knew he was going to plant a garden there. And in 1887, under very different circumstances, Giuseppe and Angella Nardiello left their village in southern Italy for Connecticut. They took with them, among other things, seeds for the sweet red peppers they grew every year. Today I can order seeds for Jimmy Nardello peppers, named for the couple’s fourth son; they’re a farmers’-market favorite in California.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T12:39:54.366+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
