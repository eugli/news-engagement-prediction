The 20-second illustrated clips at the end of each episode is one of the parts to look forward to in the drama. Comic artist Yang Kyung Soo picks out the funniest parts of the show and makes them even better by adding his own humor. Translation: “Tonight, my mother’s kkakdugi (cubed radish kimchi) comes to mind.” \nOne of the producers of the drama revealed, “When I first heard the idea to have an illustrated video at the end, I had doubts about how it would do. But when I saw the drawings for the first episode, it was really nice, and I thought it matched well with the tone of the drama.” Translation: “This is my hidden ‘rip off punch’!” \nThe artist said, “I don’t usually watch dramas, but I’m a big fan of ‘Chief Kim.’ The drama is so great that I don’t have to work too hard to make the clips funny.” Translation: “Chief~” \nHowever, illustrating for the drama is not an easy task.

Even so, he enjoys the job he is given, explaining, “I’m always short on time, but as a fan, I always look forward to the drama. The drama itself is really fun, so I get ideas really quickly.” Translation: “Dramatic appearance!” / Bam!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T13:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T08:30:24.375+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
