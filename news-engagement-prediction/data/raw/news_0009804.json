The train was silent as everyone stared at each other, uncomfortable and unsure what to do. \nOne guy got up and said, “Hand sanitizer gets rid of Sharpie. We need alcohol.” He found some tissues and got to work. \nI’ve never seen so many people simultaneously reach into their bags and pockets looking for tissues and Purel. Within about two minutes, all the Nazi symbolism was gone. \nNazi symbolism. On a public train. In New York City. In 2017. \n“I guess this is Trump’s America,” said one passenger. No sir, it’s not. Not tonight and not ever. Not as long as stubborn New Yorkers have anything to say about it. \nNew York police have reported a spike in such incidents in the wake of Donald Trump’s presidential election.
