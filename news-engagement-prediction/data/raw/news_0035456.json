IndiaToday.in | Written by Devarsi Ghosh A + A - \nFriday, February 17 was jam-packed with multiple Bollywood and Hollywood releases. \nOn the Bollywood front, there was the war film The Ghazi Attack, the romantic caper Running Shaadi and the eco-thriller Irada. Competing with these was Akshay Kumar -starrer Jolly LLB 2 which released the week before. \nAdding to the woes were the Hollywood releases; Silence, John Wick 2, The Lego Batman Movie and Hidden Figures. \nWhile Irada's box-office returns were negligible, The Ghazi Attack and Running Shaadi managed to reach a respectable first-day total at the box-office on Friday, considering that both films are devoid of big stars. \nMOVIE REVIEW: RUNNING SHAADI \nWhile The Ghazi Attack starring Rana Daggubati, Kay Kay Menon, Atul Kulkarni and Taapsee Pannu grossed Rs 4.25 crore from all over India, Running Shaadi managed to earn a modest Rs 1 crore at the box office. The Hindi version of The Ghazi Attack earned Rs 1.65 crore. \nThe Ghazi Attack has received favourable reviews from critics and considering its themes of war and patriotism plus the additional advantage of being uniquely set inside a submarine, the film is expected to earn big on Saturday and Sunday. \nHowever, the Amit Sadh and Taapsee Pannu-starrer Running Shaadi has to really pull up its socks in the weekend if it hopes to become a profitable venture for its producers.
