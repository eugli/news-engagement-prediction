Further announcement coming soon,\" the former WBO champion tweeted. Article continues below \nKhan responded to the veteran's tweet with an image of a Pac-Man arcade machine along with the caption \"Time to play\", further reinstating his interest in the meeting. \nThe Brit is understood to have agreed terms with Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum for a showdown with the eight-weight division champion. Article continues below Wayne Shaw reveals the real reason he ate a pie during the Arsenal game \nA potential clash between the two was set to take place two years back, but the 38-year-old Filipino pulled out while Khan was interested. \nDespite the boost provided by Pacquiao's acknowledgement of the negotiations, the welterweight legend is yet to sign his end of the deal which would confirm the fight. \nPacquiao has been under pressure from fans to face Khan and the Bolton man topped an online poll to choose his next opponent. \nThe United Arab Emirates is being touted as a possible venue for the mammoth event, but Khan's team believe that they might be able to coax the \"Pacman\" into a clash at the Macron Stadium, home to Bolton Wanderers Football Club. \nThe return of manager Asif Vali has provided a boost for Khan's team, who met with Arum last month at Las Vegas while attending Carl Frampton's defeat to Leo Santa Cruz. \nKhan's initial plan was to have a tune-up fight following a crucial surgery on his right hand, which had reportedly been broken for the last 15 years, after the 30-year-old's brutal knockout at the hands of Saul Alvarez. \nHowever, the former WBA and IBF champion couldn't resist the opportunity to fight Pacquiao, who was his training partner at Freddie Roach's Wildcard gym in Los Angeles. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
