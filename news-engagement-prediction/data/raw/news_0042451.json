It’s been pretty warm over the weekend (Picture: Rex Shutterstock) \n‘Temperatures will climb in the south to 16°C, with a small chance of 17°C in London and parts of East Anglia.’ \nDespite the balmy temperatures most places will be beneath cloudy, drizzly skies all day, with sunny spells confined to the south east of England.
