Through a recent partnership with Hong Kong-based Tink Labs Limited , Digi are now looking into helping hoteliers in Malaysia to deliver the same value-added service for their guests. \nTink Labs is known for its customized version of Android called handy which is designed for the hospitality industry from ground-up. In general, the custom OS allows hotels to add additional services into the handy-powered smartphones such as notifications, internal push messaging, and local city guides while guests can still use those phones for calling, Internet browsing, and social media just like a normal smartphone. \nIn fact, hoteliers can also choose to allow guests access their concierge or even order room service remotely through handy-powered smartphone. Additionally, they can also be set as keyless door access, and in-room entertainment remote control. \nThrough this partnership, Digi not only enables handy devices to run on its 4G+ network but also becomes the sole distributor of handy solution in Malaysia. In a way, this is quite a new venture for Digi but if it plays the card right, handy smartphones could be a common value added service for hotels throughout the country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T20:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:45:43.875+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
