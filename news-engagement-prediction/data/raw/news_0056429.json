Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said many people who confronted him at a town hall earlier this month were outside agitators from other states. He also told the Deseret News it was \"more of a paid attempt to bully and intimidate\" than an accurate reflection of the concerns of his constituents.\nRep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., held a town hall by conference call rather than risk an in-person appearance because \"recent town hall meetings across the country have devolved into unproductive shouting matches, with highly-organized, partisan special interest groups effectively hijacking the forums and crowding out local residents who want respectful discourse.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T12:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T12:59:54.842+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
