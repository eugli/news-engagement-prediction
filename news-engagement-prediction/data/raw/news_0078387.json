The term milk with the appropriate descriptor is the correct and proper way to inform consumers what the product is,\" it says. \n\"Why this fear from the dairy industry about words and terms that have been in use and understood by consumers for a long time?\" it says. \nMitch Humphries, president of the Australian Buffalo Industry Council, says it was considering how it will support Dairy Connect because it was also frustrated by the misuse of the word. \n\"You can't use corn syrup and call it honey and you don't expect margarine to be branded as butter - there would be an uproar if that started happening,\" he says. \n\"Concerns about milk substitutes hijacking milk's respected name seem to be gaining increasing discussion.\" \nLauren Brisbane, a camel breeder and milk supplier, says the use of the term on non-dairy products was \"pretty offensive and very misleading\" and she supported Dairy Connect's move. \nMr Morgan says another issue was that non-dairy milks lacked the nutritional and health benefits provided by fresh dairy milk. \nNutritionist Susie Burrell says the biggest issues with drinks such as almond and rice milks was they were naturally low in protein and calcium, so shoppers should choose ones with added calcium and steer clear of added sugars. \n\"Oat milk also contains the added benefit of dietary fibre, which may help to lower blood cholesterol levels,\" she says. \n\"Soy has one of the highest sources of plant protein ... is also lower in saturated fat than dairy milk, and in general there is regular, reduced fat and low fat soy milk available to suit your preference.\" \nJohn McQueen, Australian Dairy Farmers' interim chief executive, says the status quo was appropriate, and calling for a specific ban was a \"waste of breath\". \nIndustry group Soy Australia did not respond to Fairfax Media's request for comment before deadline.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T08:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:07:03.890+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
