Congrats to Karyakartas.” \nApplauding BJP’s massive victory in Maharashtra civic polls, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said it is a great start to the year. In a series of tweets, he praised BJP workers, particularly Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and state party president Raosaheb Danve Patil, for tirelessly working for the people. Noting that the “overwhelming blessings” in Maharashtra came after Odisha, he thanked “each and every Indian for continuously placing their faith in BJP”. \n“It has been been a great start to 2017. First unprecedented support in Odisha and now overwhelming blessings from people of Maharashtra,” said Modi after the BJP came second in BMC bagging 82 of 227 seats and gaining hugely in nine other major civic bodies of Maharashtra. It has been a great start to 2017!

Congrats to Karyakartas.” He added, “BJP is unwavering in the resolve to serve Maharashtra with unparalleled diligence, transparency & taking the state to even greater heights.” \nFinance Minister Arun Jaitley too hailed the party’s astounding win in Mahrashtra saying the results confirms that the party is capable of winning major states on its own. He also hit out at Congress for its dismal show. “In Odisha, Congress got squeezed out of contest. In Maharashtra, it got pushed to 3rd or 4th place in most cities. Results of local polls in Odisha & Maharashtra have shown that BJP is capable of winning major States on its own,” said Jaitley. \nBJP President Amit Shah lauded Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and BJP state President Raosaheb Danve for the party’s “unprecedented success” in the BMC and other civic bodies elections. “I heartily congratulate the people of Maharashtra for supporting the BJP’s policy of development and reposing faith in ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikaas’ agenda,” Shah tweeted. \nUnion Home Minister Rajnath Singh spoke to Fadnavis to congratulate him on the BJP’s “exceptional performance” and said the BJP activists have helped expand its base across the state. \nUnion Urban Development Minister M.

Across Maharashtra, however, the BJP made major gains in elections held for municipal bodies. The Shiv Sena victory came in Thane. The BJP was set to gain control of at least six civic bodies — Pune, Nashik, Ulhasnagar, Akola, Nagpur and Amravati — out of the 10 corporations for which the elections were held on Tuesday. The party also did well in the Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation, as per the latest trends. \nThe BJP also appeared to have expanded its base in Pimpri Chinchwad, despite fierce competition from the NCP. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:21:58.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
