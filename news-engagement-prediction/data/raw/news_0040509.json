By Indira A.R. Lakshmanan February 15, 2017 W hen Donald Trump promised to drain the swamp, we didn’t realize it would start with his inner circle. Trump confidante Lieutenant General Michael Flynn is out after being exposed for being less than truthful with the vice president and the FBI about dodgy discussions he had with the Russian ambassador the day President Obama sanctioned Moscow for interfering in the election. Flynn’s 24-day tenure as national security adviser was the shortest in history — half the average life span of a female mosquito. But don’t assume the swamp is drained. There are new reports of repeated contacts during the campaign between Russian intelligence agents and Trump aides. We don’t know where this story ends, but we do know the central question: Is something rotten in the White House? Advertisement We also know, given the pattern of deceptions from the White House, what the next step should be, irrespective of partisan loyalties and agendas: Congress must take up its constitutional duty and investigate any interests or actions that might undermine our democracy. \nIn the Flynn saga, the question inevitably is this: Following Russian hacking and front-page reporting on intelligence probes of links between Moscow and team Trump during the campaign, wouldn’t an incoming national security adviser consult and inform the president-elect about his conversations with the Russian ambassador?

But here’s the rub: US intelligence monitors ambassadors’ calls, and the Justice Department thought Flynn’s comments might violate the Logan Act, which prohibits private citizens from negotiating with foreign governments. The acting attorney general warned the White House that Flynn could be vulnerable to blackmail for lying. Even after The Washington Post broke the story, Flynn continued denials before finally admitting that he and Kislyak had “a brief discussion.” According to Flynn, he told Kislyak, “Look, I know this happened. We’ll review everything” once Trump is president. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T05:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T13:40:05.270+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
