(Photo courtesy of Sidwell Friends) Both are two-sport athletes in basketball and volleyball, both are both 6 feet tall, and though 20 years separate their varsity careers, both have made a name for themselves at Sidwell Friends .\nSo it’s not surprising that sophomore Nalani Lyde gets compared to her mother, Jan é e Hayes, and is asked all the time whether she would win a one-on-one basketball game.\n\nWhen they last played a few years ago, Lyde said she was overpowered by the former professional basketball player.\n“It got ugly,” she said. “I thought I was ready, and I wasn’t.”\nThat’s why Lyde wants to wait a little longer for the rematch. But if her play this winter is any indication, she might be more ready than she thinks. The Sidwell forward/center has emerged not only as a dominant force in the paint but as a scorer and all-around playmaker. Lyde is averaging 11.8 points, 14.9 rebounds and 2.3 blocks per game, flashing passing skills (2.3 assists) not usually found in players with her size. She is not only long and athletic, but she can handle the ball and lead the fast break.\nLyde has 14 double-doubles this season, none more impressive than her 29-point, 24-rebound game against Episcopal on Dec. 10. In Wednesday’s regular season finale, she recorded 10 points and 14 rebounds in a 45-37 win against Stone Ridge.\nHayes, a 1997 Sidwell graduate, was a dominant force inside. She was an All-Met in volleyball and basketball before becoming a two-sport athlete at Duke and playing professional basketball abroad. She said “it’s surreal” seeing her daughter excel in a Sidwell uniform.\n“I get more excited watching her play that I’ve ever felt playing myself,” Hayes said. “It’s like experiencing it all over again, but from a distance.”\nLyde possesses some of the same strength and power as her mother, but is complementing that with a finesse game to thrive as a versatile forward. A middle blocker in volleyball, she was an All-Met honorable mention in the fall and is receiving interest letters from schools for both sports.\n“I want to try to play both in college, try my best,” Lyde said. “Maybe one year play one sport, one year do the other.”\nAs for the next mother-daughter one-on-one game, Lyde said she wants to wait until she is sure she can win.\n“Maybe right before I graduate,” Lyde said. “But hopefully soon. That’s my goal.”\nNUMBER CRUNCH: 13 \nYears it took for the Huntingtown boys’ basketball team to win its first Southern Maryland Athletic Conference title. The Hurricanes had four double-figure scorers in last night’s 63-58 championship victory over Westlake , their first since the school opened its doors in 2004. \nBREAKFAST LINKS: \nThe Wilson boys won their first DCIAA basketball title since 1984; Mya Moye led the Anacostia girls past Bell The Wise boys and Eleanor Roosevelt girls won the Prince George’s County basketball titles Preview of the Maryland girls’ basketball state tournaments Preview of the Maryland boys’ basketball state tournaments A last-second putback sent the Herndon boys past Lake Braddock and into the state tournament High school football made two major rule changes for player safety Four days after blowing a huge lead, the Old Mill boys held off Meade to win an Anne Arundel title National Christian freshman Elizabeth Martino is a top-30 national recruit in her class BASKETBALL VIDEOS \nAfter a 33 year drought, the Tigers finally bring home a DCIAA championship.
