Ad Feedback \n\"The trees are a nuisance and they are too big for the street. Cambridge has got maples which are half the size and that is what we need here,\" he said. \nHe said money from the council's redevelopment project of Leith Pl should also be spend down the street. \n\"They are doing the annual plan and budget now for next year and I know the Leith Pl redevelopment is not totally finalised yet so they have got some money which they could budget towards this,\" he said. \nMayor Jenny Shattock thanked Foote for his suggestions but no other comments were made by councillors. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T04:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:16:59.762+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
