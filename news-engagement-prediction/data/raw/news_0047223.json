And that's very dangerous.\" \nWallace is the host of \"Fox News Sunday\" and was the moderator of the third presidential debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton. \nMeanwhile, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus also appeared on \"Fox News Sunday,\" where he and Wallace sparred over the president's words. \nPriebus defended Trump by saying that he was not talking about all news but about \"certain things that are happening in the news that just aren't honest.\" \nWallace pressed Priebus and argued that the president was not referring to individual stories. \n\"You don't get to tell us what to do any more than Barack Obama did,\" Wallace said after continued arguments with Priebus. \"Barack Obama whined about Fox News all the time, but I got to say, he never said that we were an enemy of the people.\" \nWallace is not the only high-profile figure to disagree with Trump's declaration about the media. On Sunday, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said he did not have any issues with the press and did not see the media as the enemy. \nIn an interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that aired Sunday, Sen. John McCain , R-Ariz., said making moves to shut down a free press was \"how dictators get started.\" \n\"In other words, a consolidation of power,\" McCain told \"Meet the Press\" host Chuck Todd from Munich. \"When you look at history, the first thing that dictators do is shut down the press. And I'm not saying that President Trump is trying to be a dictator. I'm just saying we need to learn the lessons of history.\" \nThe 80-year-old senator told Todd that a free press was central to a functional democracy, even if news organizations' stories challenged those being held accountable. \n\"I hate the press. I hate you, especially,\" he said to Todd, who laughed. \"But the fact is, we need you. We need a free press. We must have it. It's vital.\" \n\"If you want to preserve democracy as we know it, you have to have a free and, many times, adversarial press,\" McCain added. \"And without it, I am afraid that we would lose so much of our individual liberties over time. That's how dictators get started.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T05:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T00:47:53.477+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
