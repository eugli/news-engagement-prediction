Share this video Watch Next celebs Britney Spears has one of the most successful residencies in Las Vegas, but it all went a little wrong last night.\nThe legendary icon, who released her latest album Glory to rave reviews last year, hit the stage last night in Sin City to a sold-out crowd.\nDuring a performance of one of her string of smash hits, the star unfortunately had a major wardrobe malfunction that left her exposed.\nAs she pulled off a tricky dance move, the star's boob popped out of her top and the moment was caught by an eagle-eyed fan.\nBritney had an unfortunate slip (Photo: Twitter) It appears that a dancer accidentally grabbed the wrong part of the stars outfit, which led to the unfortunate incident.\nAfter making a comeback last year, Britney is back and has even blagged herself an absolute hunk of a boyfriend, 22-year-old fitness model Sam Asghari.\nBut a Lifetime biopic that comes out later this month has threatened to hark back to painful memories the star won't want to relive .\nThere's a controversial new film about her life (Photo: Lifetime) The film has described it as \"the tumultuous story of pop icon Britney Spears' rise to fame, fall from grace and eventual triumphant resurrection, firmly securing her position as one of the world's greatest entertainers.\"\nRead More Britney Spears looks incredible in a pink leotard during her Las Vegas residency Australian actress Natasha Basset has taken on the role of the 35-year-old, which will see her donning some of Britney’s iconic stage outfits and recreating the events in 2007 that led to the singer shaving her hair off in Esther’s Haircutting Studio in Tarzana, California before she attacked a photographer's car with an umbrella.\nBritney hasn't approved the flick (Photo: Getty) Discussing the role, Natasha explained: \"I mean, she’s not like anybody else. Her entire life, she’s been chased by paparazzi, and she’s constantly being scrutinized and in the public eye, so it’s not normal.\"\n\"I really appreciated how strong she is. Emotionally, the way she got through the constant pressures that she was faced with is admirable. \"\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Watch this video again Video will play in Britney's hair-shaving meltdown captured in Lifetime trailer Share this video Watch Next Like Celebs Newsletter Follow @mirrorceleb Subscribe to our Celebs Britney Spears", "external_links": ["http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201701/560/4221396001_5297502779001_5297486132001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/trinity-images/logos/mirror.png", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/66/4221396001_5307573247001_5307573030001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=mirrorceleb", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/1370/4221396001_5306625139001_5306628579001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove04.o.brightcove.com/4221396001/4221396001_5294770149001_5294497843001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201701/2328/4221396001_5298181978001_5298157067001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/2222/4221396001_5307659822001_5307660096001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201701/1833/4221396001_5301955418001_5301944337001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorCeleb", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/1538/4221396001_5306773953001_5306768694001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201701/656/4221396001_5299804169001_5299783872001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001"], "published": "2017-02-02T11:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T11:59:05.754+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
