The excerpt of the call did not detail who exactly Trump considered \"bad hombres,\" nor did it make clear the tone and context of the remark, made in a Friday morning phone call between the leaders. It also did not contain Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto 's response. Still, the excerpt offers a rare and striking look at how the new president is conducting diplomacy behind closed doors. Trump's remarks suggest he is using the same tough and blunt talk with world leaders that he used to rally crowds on the campaign trail. A White House spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. The Mexican Foreign Relations Department told The AP: \"The negative statements you refer to did not occur during said telephone call. On the contrary, the tone was constructive.\" The phone call between the leaders was intended to patch things up between the new president and his ally. The two have had a series of public spats over Trump's determination to have Mexico pay for the planned border wall, something Mexico steadfastly refuses to agree to. \nLast week, President Trump signed an executive order that started the ball rolling on his plan to build an \"impenetrable\" wall between the U.S. and Mexico. His proposal would see a wall built that covers 1,000 of the 1,900 mile long border but how much would it cost? A good place to start is by looking at the cost of the 650 miles of fencing that is currently in place which, with at a price of $2.8 million - $3.9 million per mile, has cost the U.S. government $7 billion. One study estimates that Trump's wall could cost $25 billion. Another suggested, minus labor & land acquisitions costs it could be $15 billion. In fact, concrete & cement alone could cost $1 billion. If Mexico refuses to pay for the all, the bill could land at te feet of Americans, costing each household an average of $120.
