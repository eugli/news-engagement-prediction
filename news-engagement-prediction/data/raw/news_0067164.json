Dir., Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect, on President Trump's acknowledgment of Antisemitism today: pic.twitter.com/87ecU5PgrB \n— Adriana Allegri (@adrianaallegri) February 21, 2017 \nSean Spicer today pushed back against Goldstein’s statement , but Goldstein told Erin Burnett tonight that Trump was clearly “forced” to address the issue. \nMcEnany said that Trump pretty clearly already condemned anti-Semitism and asked Goldstein if he thinks Trump is prejudiced against Jews. He said, “You bet.” \nMcEnany asked him if Trump hates his daughter Ivanka and his son-in-law Jared . Goldstein said he’s tired of people invoking them to defend Trump on this issue, crying, “Have you no ethics than to invoke people’s religion as a talking point? That itself is anti-Semitic!” \nThe two of them fought back and forth and at one point Goldstein told her, “That’s very nice for Breitbart news, but not for CNN. You are using fake news arguments, shame on you!” \nYou can watch the whole thing above, via CNN. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:07:48.797+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
