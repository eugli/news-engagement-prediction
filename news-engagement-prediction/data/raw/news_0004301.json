LUCIE — Erin go bragh. \nFollowing a magnificent minor league season, left-handed pitcher P.J. Conlon, who was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in 1993, was invited to major league camp by the Mets and will arrive here next weekend. \nThis will be a spring training of learning, but if Conlon someday achieves his major league dream, he will be accomplishing something historic. \nIn all, there have been 47 Irish-born major leaguers, according to Baseball-Reference.com , but just one in the modern era, and that was in 1945, when Joe Cleary pitched one-third of an inning for the Washington Senators and gave up seven runs, good for a 189.0 ERA. \nThe only Belfast native to play in the major leagues, the Mets note, was outfielder/pitcher Irish McIlveen, who played for the New York Highlanders in the early 1900s. \nConlon went a combined 12-2 with a 1.65 ERA (26 earned runs in 142 innings) between Single-A Columbia of the South Atlantic League and Single-A St. Lucie of the Florida State League — this could get interesting. That was the lowest ERA in the minors. \nThat performance catapulted Conlon, 23, to be named the Sterling Organizational Pitcher of the Year. His fastball is in the 87-90 range, and he commands his pitches. \nThe 5-foot-11, 180-pound Conlon, who pitched at the University of San Diego, was a 13th-round draft pick in 2015. He works fast, too. \nSo, just how does a baby born in Belfast wind up in the Mets organization? \nConlon was born during The Troubles, a 30-year conflict that began in Ireland in the late-1960s. \nConlon’s mother, Susan, was born in Scotland and his father, Patrick, was born in Ireland, but they met in California. They both moved there during their high school years and met during their college years. \n“My mom went to Fresno State and my dad went to Cal-State Fullerton,’’ Conlon said. His dad is a P.E. teacher. His mom is a recreational therapist. “They got their citizenship after they came back with me.’’ \nFollowing college they moved to Belfast, and in 1993, P.J. was born. \n“We lived on Falls Road in Belfast,’’ Conlon told The Post on Friday by phone from Salt Lake City. That was one of the most dangerous areas. Conlon Columbia Fireflies \n“It was during The Troubles over there and my parents kind of decided the best decision, the safest decision was to move to California,’’ Conlon said. “They were familiar with it and decided to move back when I was around 2.’’ \nWhen Conlon was 16, he visited Ireland with his grandparents and cousin. \n“We stayed in Belfast for awhile, we went to Dublin, I got to see a lot of things like the house I lived in, the hospital I was born in,’’ Conlon said. “We have a ton of family over there, so it was a really cool thing to be able to go, I’m hoping to go back sometime soon. \n“I’m always getting calls from Ireland, they are sending me messages on Facebook, saying they are keeping up with my career and they are actually learning how baseball works and understand it. It’s pretty cool. \n“Baseball in Ireland is picking up, they have adult leagues, kids leagues and they have a National Team. I had the opportunity to play with Great Britain in the WBC last September, they were in the Brooklyn qualifier, but I had reached my innings limit.’’ \nAt the University of San Diego, Conlon was teammates with Kris Bryant. \n“My freshman year was his junior year when he won the Golden Spikes Award, that was great to watch firsthand,’’ Conlon said. “I sent him a text after he won the World Series. He is one of the best guys that I know.’’ \nConlon can’t wait for camp to start. \n“I just want to be around the big leaguers and see what I can pick up from them,’’ he said. “There is not a better way to learn.’’ \nThis has been the longest of journeys. but the wind is at P.J. Conlon’s back. Share this: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T08:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T04:10:03.624+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
