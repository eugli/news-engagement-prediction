Video then emerged of Wahlberg and his sons heading for the NRG Stadium exit after the third quarter. \nAfter copping some flak on social media, Wahlberg later clarified that his youngest child was feeling unwell. \"I had to leave the game early because my youngest wasn't feeling well. Trust me, I would have loved to be at the stadium - but family first. Doesn't mean I don't love my Patriots too!\" the post said. — Allen Reid (@Allen_Reid) February 6, 2017 A photo posted by Mark Wahlberg (@markwahlberg) on Feb 5, 2017 at 8:43pm PST", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T12:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T08:03:33.168+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
