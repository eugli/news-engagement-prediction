(John Wagner) \nBut the descendants of the revered abolitionist - who, just to be clear, died in 1895 after becoming a powerful voice against slavery and then Jim Crow - responded on Wednesday. \n\"My first instinct was to go on the attack,\" said Kenneth B. Morris Jr., Douglass' great-great-great grandson. \"I think it was obvious to anyone that heard [Trump's] comments or read his comments that he was not up to speed on who Frederick Douglass was. We just thought that was an opportunity to do a history lesson and to make some points about what we're currently working on.\" \nThe family released a statement on the Huffington Post on Wednesday. \n\"Like the President, we use the present tense when referencing Douglass's accomplishments because his spirit and legacy are still very much alive, not just during Black History Month, but every month,\" the family wrote. \n\". . .
