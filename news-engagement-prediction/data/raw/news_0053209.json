Highway 17 , Santa Cruz Mountains \nSANTA CRUZ MOUNTAINS (CBS SF) – Nowhere in the Bay Area are commuters more frustrated with the recent rainy weather than on Highway 17 – the main artery to San Jose from Santa Cruz through the Santa Cruz Mountains. \nFor weeks, a massive slide has put a near stranglehold on traffic as it has blocked several lanes. More than an hour has been added to the daily commute each way. \nSo when a huge Redwood tumbled onto the roadway at around 3 p.m. during Monday’s storm, the commuters took matters into their own hands. \nSome of the drivers had chainsaws in their cars. \nThey exited their vehicles, fired up the chainsaws and began slicing the tree into pieces. \nOther drivers helped remove the chopped up wood off the roadway. \nThe operation was well underway when Caltrans crews showed up. By 4 p.m., the tree was clear and the commute underway again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:14:42.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
