Now U.S. Sen. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., says he won't support her nomination. (Dwight Adams/IndyStar) Wochit \nThat didn’t take long. \nVice President Pence may soon get to cast his first tie-breaking vote in the Senate. \nTwo Republicans – Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska – announced Wednesday they will vote against the confirmation of Betsy DeVos as education secretary. \nIf the 50 other Senate Republicans vote for DeVos, and the 46 Democrats and two independents who caucus with them oppose her, the Senate would split 50-50. \nThe vice president gets to break any ties. \nVice President Biden never got that chance. Nor did the last Hoosier vice president, Dan Quayle. \nVice President Cheney, however, broke eight ties. \nPence would likely get particular pleasure in voting for DeVos, a Michigan philanthropist and staunch voucher advocate who played an influential role in developing Indiana’s largest-in-the-nation private school voucher program. \nAs governor, Mike Pence strongly advocated for education reforms , overseeing a vast expansion of the state’s private school voucher program and a boost in funding for charter schools. \nDeVos poured $1.7 million into Indiana from 2012-14, with the grant money mostly benefiting a school choice network. \nThe DeVos family and affiliated organizations have also contributed $2.5 million to Hoosier politicians since 2004, including $95,000 last year to Gov. Eric Holcomb, Pence’s chosen successor. Pence’s gubernatorial campaign received at least $15,000. \nIn announcing their opposition to DeVos, Collins and Murkowski questioned both her experience and commitment to public schools. \nSen. Todd Young, R-Ind., voted Tuesday to advance DeVos’ nomination to the Senate floor. \nA floor vote has not been scheduled. \nIndyStar reporters Stephanie Wang and Chelsea Schneider contributed. \nContact Maureen Groppe at mgroppe@gannett.com.
