Image: nikhorne via redbubble By Marissa Wenzke 2017-02-18 03:02:47 UTC \nThe sharp diss Donald Trump lobbed at a BBC editor on Thursday has been immortalized into a t-shirt, because why not, it's 2017. \n\"Here's another beauty\" was the sarcastic quip an angry Trump threw at BBC North America Editor Jon Sopel during a press conference. When Sopel tried asking Trump a question about his blocked travel ban, he cut him off and asked what news outlet he was with. And the rest is history. \nSopel swiftly defended the BBC to no avail: \"That's a good line,\" Sopel said, trying to hold back as he defended his organization, saying \"Impartial, free and fair.\" SEE ALSO: 'Fake news' has officially hit Britain and people can't cope \nSince that cringeworthy exchange, Sopel's moment in the Trumpian sun has been made into a t-shirt. BBC doesn't appear to be involved, but the top has appeared for sale on a website called Redbubble, which has a collection of work from over 400,000 independent artists. \"BBC News - another beauty\" Watched the press conference? Buy the t-shirt. https://t.co/3eCpfxZ8vs \n— simon wilson (@siwilso) February 17, 2017 \nThe artist who's name the shirt is listed under, \"nikhorne,\" has other politically-minded clothing up for sale, like patriotically red, white and blue \"Nasty Woman\" and \"Bad Hombre\" t-shirts. But this t-shirt has attracted the attention of Sopel himself. \n\"I've made it,\" the BBC editor tweeted on Friday. \"Though hurt I wasn't asked to model it ... I've made it. Though hurt I wasn't asked to model it.... https://t.co/MWbwRxrZZs \n— Jon Sopel (@BBCJonSopel) February 17, 2017 \nMashable has reached out to nikhorne and BBC for comment.
