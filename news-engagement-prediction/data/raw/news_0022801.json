The purchase does not include Settoon Towing’s Gathering & Storage and Logistics & Vessel Management business lines.\nSavage Inland Marine will use the marine assets to transport a variety of liquid products on the Intracoastal and inland waterways, operating out of south Louisiana. As part of the agreement, Savage Inland Marine expects to hire approximately 250 current Settoon employees.\n“These strategic assets will strengthen our ability to serve customers in the inland waterway. We look forward to welcoming the Settoon employees involved in this business segment as Savage Team Members,” said Kirk Aubry, Savage President and Chief Executive Officer. “During a brief transitional period, we will be working closely with Settoon under an operating agreement that will ensure a seamless transition for the customers we serve.”\nWith existing operations in Orange County, Texas, Savage Inland Marine currently provides monitored barge fleeting, operates inland push boats and provides dock services on the Neches River.
