He added that the operation was unprecedented in Greece , “where a bomb of this size has never been found in an area this densely populated”. \nRegional authorities said the entire operation would take up to eight hours, but local military spokesman Colonel Nikos Phanios was more cautious. \n“We don’t know what we’re going to find,” he said. Defusing the bomb and then moving it to a military shooting range “could take us up to two days”, he added. It was not known who dropped the bomb or when it fell, Phanios said. \nA thousand police officers have been mobilised for the evacuation, with residents given several days’ warning via the media, leaflets and posts on social networks. \nThessaloniki residents were facing disruption on the bus and train networks, with facilities set up to host evacuees in need of shelter. \nPeople living in a nearby refugee camp will also have to be evacuated, the migration ministry said, without specifying the number affected. At their request, the refugees will use the evacuation as an opportunity to visit the local archaeology museum, the ministry added. \nSeven decades after the end of the second world war, unexploded bombs are still being found around the globe. \nOn 23 January, dozens of people were evacuated after a bomb was found near a Hong Kong university, while three days earlier experts disposed of a suspected second world war bomb found close to parliament in London . \nIn the German city of Augsburg, 54,000 people had to leave their homes on 25 December while authorities dealt with a bomb dropped by Britain during the second world war.
