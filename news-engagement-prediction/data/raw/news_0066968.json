That was the same proportion as the boards of 11 big retail companies and more than any of the other seven industry groups PwC studied. Across the entire S&P 500, 21 per cent of board members were female. \nBanking companies may not retain their lead, however, as the industry added new female directors at a slower rate than most others last year. Thirteen per cent of their board hires were women, compared with 32 per cent in the S&P 500. At retailers, 44 per cent of new directors were female. Entertainment and media companies led the pack with women making up 60 per cent of new directors. Insurance companies ranked last at 7 per cent. \nShareholders have been pressuring companies to refresh their boards with more diverse directors to better respond to new business challenges and to bring them more in line with international norms. \n“Investors want to make sure the board is composed of the right individuals to help the company make the right decisions today and take the company into the future,” said Paula Loop, leader of PwC’s Governance Insights Center. \nIt noted that the diversity companies need extends beyond gender to “race, ethnicity, skills, experience, expertise, age and even geography”, but said that gender composition “is a good indicator” of how companies are trying to increase overall diversity. \nPwC’s report did not identify specific companies within the industry groups it examined. According to Financial Times research, among the six biggest US banks by revenue, Wells Fargo has the highest proportion of female board members at 36 per cent, followed by Citigroup at 35 per cent, Bank of America with 31 per cent, Goldman Sachs at 23 per cent, JPMorgan on 17 per cent and Morgan Stanley at 13 per cent. \nDespite a relatively strong presence of women in the boardroom, there are just a handful in top executive positions at the big banks. \nAmong the most prominent are Marianne Lake, chief financial officer at JPMorgan Chase, and Mary Erdoes, who runs JPM’s asset management business, both of whom are considered possible successors to Jamie Dimon as chief executive. At Bank of America, Anne Finucane serves as vice-chairman. There are only two female chief executives of banks in the S&P 500: KeyCorp’s Beth Mooney and Margaret Keane of Synchrony Financial. \nThe report also tracked whether boards employ mandatory retirement ages and term limits, tools that can help ensure that directors are regularly refreshed. \n“You need to have turnover. If you have a refreshed board, you have an opportunity at least to put on a diverse board member,” Ms Loop said.

This was followed by utilities groups, with 80 per cent, and industrial products, at 78 per cent. \nOnly 4 per cent of S&P 500 companies imposed term limits on directors. In four industry groups — banking and capital markets, communications, insurance and technology — no companies have term limits. Limits were most common at retailers, with 18 per cent using them, and entertainment and media companies, with 12 per cent. \nThe US continues to lag the UK and Europe in overall boardroom gender diversity. According to recent research from headhunter Egon Zehnder, in western Europe, 26 per cent of board seats are held by women on average, compared with 20 per cent in the US.
