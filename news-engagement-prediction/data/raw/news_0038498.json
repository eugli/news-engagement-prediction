Slot to Georgia Links \nThe NFL has released it's official list for the combine and Georgia will have one representative. Wide receiver and return specialist Isaiah McKenzie will be the only Bulldog to take part in the event early next month. \nThe 5-foot-7, 175-pound playmaker is coming off the best season of his college career after 44 receptions for 633 yards and seven touchdowns as a junior. The only Bulldogs junior to declare early for the draft, McKenzie was the Bulldogs' leading receiver in all three categories for 2016. Not a member?

McKenzie's four punter returns for a score is a Bulldog record as are his five total returns for a score. \nThe fact that UGA has only one player invited to the combine is much different than years past where Bulldogs have had multiple representatives. Players will take part in a variety of athletic tests such as the 40-yard dash, 20-yard shuttle, three-cone drill, and triple jump as well as position drills. \n(What's next for the Bulldogs?
