Similar anti-protest legislation has been introduced in several other states. \nThe state Senate approved the bill 17-13 on Wednesday in a party line vote to expand the state's criminal racketeering law to include rioting where damage of property occurs. It must still be approved by the Arizona House before going to Governor Doug Ducey, a Republican. \nA Ducey spokesman was not immediately available for comment on Thursday. The governor commonly declines comment on pending legislation. \nThe push for stricter laws coincides with opponents of President Donald Trump vowing to take to the streets to demonstrate against his policies from immigration to abortion to climate change. \nOpponents of the Arizona bill said it was unconstitutional and would serve to harm Arizona’s reputation nationally. \n\"Any criminal acts that could be committed during a protest are already exactly that – criminal,\" state Senator Martin Quezada, Senate Democratic Whip, said in a statement on Thursday. \n\"This bill only serves to chill people's rights to free speech by allowing one bad actor to turn peaceful demonstration organizers into racketeering felons,\" he added. \nThe bill's sponsor, state Senator Sonny Borrelli, told Reuters in an email that those being “paid to commit these criminal acts,” needed to be held accountable. The legislation said police could also level conspiracy charges against organizers of an event who were not present. \nDemocrats countered by questioning the claim that protestors were being paid to be violent, with one lawmaker calling it \"fake news,\" a term Trump has used when describing news reports he has disagreed with or called incorrect. \n(Reporting by David Schwartz, Editing by Ben Klayman and Grant McCool) Next In U.S. Trump's transgender move puts spotlight on Supreme Court case \nWASHINGTON The Trump administration’s move on Wednesday to rescind guidance allowing transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice has raised the stakes for an upcoming U.S. Supreme Court case that could deliver a landmark decision on the issue. Arrests among dwindling demonstrators at Dakota pipeline protest camp \nCANNON BALL, N.D. More than a dozen of a dwindling number of protesters at a camp near the site of the Dakota Access pipeline were arrested on Thursday after defying a previous deadline set by authorities to vacate the Army-owned land. \nMEXICO CITY Mexico on Thursday expressed \"worry and irritation\" about U.S. policies to two of President Donald Trump's top envoys, giving a chilly reply to the new administration's hard line on immigration, trade and security.
