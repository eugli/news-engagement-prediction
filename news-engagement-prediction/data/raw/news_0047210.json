Sharjah Police yesterday arrested a gang of five Asians who allegedly scammed their victim. The gang cheated a Pakistani national. They sold him a gold plated biscuit after they convinced him that the it was worth one million dirhams. They said that because it was stolen, they would sell it to him for Dh 400,000. The victim approached the police and lodged a complaint against the gang. In his complaint, he stated that Dh400,000 was stolen from his car while it is was parked in a parking lot in Sharjah. The Sharjah Police immediately formed a team of CID officers to investigate the case. In the course of the investigation, the team managed to identify and arrest the gang. They denied the victim's accusation, but they confessed that they received cash from the complainant directly after they convinced him to buy the fake gold biscuit. They said he bought the biscuit after they convinced him it was stolen and it was worth one million dirhams. He intended to sell it for one million to make a profit. The complainant confirmed the statements of the suspects by saying that he didn't want to inform the police that he had been cheated and that he intended to buy a stolen biscuit as dealing in stolen goods is against the law. The police referred the culprits and complainant to the public prosecution on charges of theft, buying stolen goods as well as making false statements to police.Col. Ibrahim Al Ajill, Director of CID at Sharjah Police, said that when the complainant lodged the complaint, the CID officers suspected that he wasn't being entirely honest. The officers tried to convince him to reveal all, but he insisted that the cash was stolen from his parked car. The officers dealt with the case as primarily one of theft and worked on that premise. The arrested suspects said they knew the complainant and informed the police about what transpired. Al Ajill urged the public not fall victims to scammers and avoid being greedy for money in order to avoid getting involved in crimes such as buying stolen goods. afkarali@khakeejtimes.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T09:35:35.927+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
