Orion says it has now restored supply to all affected customers, but supply remained fragile because of the continuing fire threat. \n\"Orion is closely monitoring the fire, and is ready to respond as quickly as required if our network is further affected. We will keep the public fully updated as circumstances with the fires evolve,\" said Orion chief executive Rob Jameson.
