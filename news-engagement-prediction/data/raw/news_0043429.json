Scenes in the films w ere so violent they had to be changed from color to black and white to get around MPAA restrictions. Uma’s teenage son was shocked by the movie. She explained, “My son was like, ‘It hurt when they shot my mom in the chest and nailed her in the coffin.’ I was glad I waited as long as possible.” \nComedian Jason Jones also visited the Late Show but had no problems showing his 5-year-old son Kill Bill. His son even wrote a school report on it, describing the “very, very, very, very, very violent movie.” \nThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert  airs weeknights at 11:35 p.m. on CBS.  \nWatch: Bob Odenkirk plays Stephen Colbert in bizarre Late Show: The Movie . \nTell us what you think!
