Image copyright PA Image caption The McCanns sued Mr Amaral over claims he made in his 2008 book \nMr Amaral, who led the initial investigation into Madeleine's disappearance but was taken off the case in October 2007, released his book - In The Truth Of The Lie - three days after Portuguese police closed their investigation the following year. \nHe later took part in a documentary for Portuguese television in which he claimed Madeleine was dead, there had been no abduction and that the McCanns had hidden her body. \nThe McCanns have said previously the claims had exacerbated their anguish and discouraged people from coming forward with information. \nScotland Yard started a review of the case in May 2011, after then-Prime Minister David Cameron responded to a plea from the McCanns.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T08:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T04:29:54.388+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
