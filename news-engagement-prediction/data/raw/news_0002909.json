It was at the show that the Princess was invited by Harrods owner Mohamed Fayed to join his family for a holiday in the South of France, where she then met his son Dodi - which set in train the fatal events of later that summer. Diana did not wear the earrings designed to go with the necklace that evening, pairing it with her own set instead because the then Crown Jeweller, Garrard, had not yet finished making the matching earrings in time for the event. The Ukrainian couple who owner the necklace of diamonds and pearls now wants to cash in on its status and have set an asking price of £9.6million She returned the necklace after the gala ballet for the accompanying pearl-and-diamond earrings to be completed, but she died without ever seeing the finished items. Later, Garrard sold them discreetly to a British businessman who wanted them for his wife. But he put them up for auction in 1999, making what was described as a 'significant' donation to the Diana Memorial Fund from the proceeds. Both the necklace and the earrings Garrard subsequently produced have rarely been worn since. In 1999, a U.S. collector paid more than £360,000 to buy it, plus a pair of matching earrings. Later Texan furniture millionaire Jim 'Mattress Mack' McIngvale bought the piece and kept it locked in at his store in Houston, Texas, where he put them on show in order to draw in customers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T16:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T12:35:19.263+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
