Nevertheless, as Andrew Soloman writes in The New Yorker , the United States feels like a scarier place for LGBTQ community than it did last October.\nHe says:\nIt was both unsurprising and traumatic to learn on Monday about a pending executive order that would take away our basic rights, and though it was a relief to learn, the next morning, that that executive order would not be issued, the stir of vulnerability will not soon quiet down. Donald Trump was contemplating rescinding President Barack Obama's executive order granting protections to L.G.B.T.Q. Americans working for federal agencies. That Trump did not, that day, expose us to legal discrimination by our own government does not mitigate this Administration's dark view of those who deviate from its narrow definition of normality—white, U.S.-born, heterosexual, able-bodied, and Christian—which excludes the majority of Americans.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below Although the executive order might not be signed for now, it's remains true that Donald Trump is against same-sex marriage, and the future is unclear on what's coming for the community next — especially for those who aren't Ivanka and Jared's rich, white, cisgendered gay friends.\nIt won't be good, if conservative leaders have anything to do with it.\n\"Our base would want to know who is responsible for what we believe is an issue of religious liberty — that would be of concern to us,\" said Bob Vander Plaats, the chief executive of The Family Leader, a socially conservative organization.\n\"We have been consistent,\" Mr. Vander Plaats added. \"We've cheered President Trump a lot. But on this one, our base is wondering why Obama's executive order would be allowed to stand?\"\nFrom: Cosmopolitan", "external_links": ["http://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/a8676815/ivanka-trump-and-jared-kushner-said-to-have-stopped-lgbtq-rights-roll-back/", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/03/us/politics/lgbt-rights-ivanka-trump-jared-kushner.html", "http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/fear-and-loathing-in-trumps-america?mbid=rss"], "published": "2017-02-06T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T00:08:03.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
