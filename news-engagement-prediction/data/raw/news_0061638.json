What is TRAPPIST-1? \nT RAPPIST-1 is a small, dim star in the constellation Aquarius, less than 40 light-years from Earth, or 235 trillion miles away, according to Nasa and the Belgian-led research team who announced its discovery on Wednesday. \nSeven planets circle Trappist-1, with orbits ranging from one and a half to 20 days. If Trappist-1 were our sun, all these planets would fit inside the orbit of Mercury. That's how close they are to their star and why their orbits are so short. The planets have no real names. They're only known by letters, \"b\" through \"h.\" The letter \"A\" refers to the star itself. Take a trip 40 light-years away to one of the seven Earth-sized planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system. — NASA (@NASA) 23 February 2017 Why all the excitement? \nT hree of TRAPPIST-1's \"exoplanets\" are smack dab in the so-called habitable zone, also known as the Goldilocks zone, where conditions are just right for watery oceans - not too much and not too little stellar energy - greatly increasing the likelihood of life. \nNo other star system known contains such a large number of Earth-sized and probably rocky planets. \nAll are about the same size as Earth or Venus, or slightly smaller. Because the parent star is so dim, the planets are warmed gently despite having orbits much smaller than that of Mercury, the planet closest to the sun. \nScientists said they need to study the atmospheres before determining whether these rocky, terrestrial planets could support some sort of life. \nBut just because a planet is in this sweet spot, doesn't mean life exists or ever did.

If you were to stand on one of the planets, the star might appear to be salmon-colored. Its planets are clumped so closely together, they would appear twice as big as our moon in the sky. \nGazing up, it would be possible to see the geological features, oceans and clouds of your planetary neighbours. \nThe temperature could be pretty similar to Earth as well, at least on one of these planets.

Scientists say it should take five years to get a handle on all these atmospheres, and figure out whether water - and maybe life - are present.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T09:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:59:59.437+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
