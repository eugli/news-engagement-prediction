He also said Lascañas statement was garbage aimed at destroying the good relationship between Duterte and the Muslim community. \n“It’s just part of destabilization by the camps of Senators Laila de Lima and Antonio Trillanes III against the present administration,” Abdullah said.

It slowly and indirectly kill innocent people. We are supporting the war against drugs,” he said.
