Editor Advertisement \nThe rats at Bukit Batok are back! Seems like the efforts made in 2014 and 2016 to eradicate the infestation has come to nothing, and now the rats are making a comeback. \nResidents have reported seeing rats again, and the Choa Chu Kang Town Council, which is in charge of the affected estate, has also hired pest-control companies to tackle the infestation. However, residents said the measures taken by the pest-control companies were inadequate, as rat poison placed to kill the rats were often washed away by the rain. Residents have made several complaints to the Town Council, fearing a repeat of the December 2014 infestation near Bukit Batok MRT Station, in which more than 300 rats were found and killed. \nMaybe the residents can consider complaining the rats are making lots of noise, then maybe the relevant authorities will immediately come and cull the rats very quickly indeed. \nTan M H \nA.S.S.
