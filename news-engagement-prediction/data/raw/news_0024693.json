Close Concern over parents ignoring dangers of leaving children in hot cars UP NEXT VIDEO Concern over parents ignoring dangers of leaving children in hot cars. Source: 7News Concern over parents ignoring dangers of leaving children in hot cars \nA blog post on Gold Coast Mum claimed the woman was waiting in her car outside the school with her air conditioning running while her baby slept. \nThe mum said it was a warm day so she’d left the air conditioning running to keep her child cool. \nWhile she waited she said a woman knocked on her window and handed her a note. \nShe was shocked to read the note stating car air conditioning was “bad for your lungs and your complexion”. \nIt read: \n“Just a short note to let you know that your air con is very noisy. I do not use mine because it is unhealthy, bad for your lungs & most of all your complexion. \n“Do not feel obliged to turn it down, it is only my opinion about it.” The note the woman received has since been shared on Gold Coast Mum blog. \nThe mum told Kidspot she was stunned by the contents of the note. \nShe felt there was more to worry about than the noise of her air conditioning. \n“By the time I read the note she had walked off in the distance so I yelled out the window ‘I have a sleeping baby in the car, so it’s a no’,” she said. \nThe mum’s friend, Lauren, shared the note on Facebook and was disgusted by the message. Lauren also uploaded the blog post to Gold Coast Mum. Areas like Surfers Paradise on the Gold Coast are known for hot, humid weather.

Ermmmm let’s weigh up the risks shall we…” (sic) she wrote. \n“On a day like today, when the outside temperature was mid-30s, temps can reach 50 degrees plus in just a matter of minutes in an UN-air-conditioned car. I think that’s more of concern, don’t you?” \nLauren felt the “advice” was inappropriate and not OK for a stranger to share.
