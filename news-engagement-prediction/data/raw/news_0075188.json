Live Oscars 2017: Live Coverage Last Updated Feb 26, 2017 at 8:31 pm ET \nLive updates and analysis of the Academy Awards from The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Media Group entertainment and fashion reporters. SHARE Red Carpet Pro-Trump Protesters Outside the Oscars \nThe Oscars always attract a few gaggles of protesters lining the sidewalks of Highland Avenue. Many of them are fire-and-brimstone religious conservatives, warning of divine retribution on the souls of Hollywood's celebrities for their apparently godless lives of materialism and licentiousness. \nThis year, however, the \"Sodom and Gomorrah\" signs were outnumbered by serried ranks of \"Trump\" and \"Make America Great Again\" placards. \nAnticipating no doubt an evening of relentless verbal assaults on the 45th president from the stage of the Dolby Theater, the vocal Trump supporters, like their seemed eager to get their retaliation in first. \nIt was likely the last pro-Trump message the Oscar-goers would get to hear tonight.
