T-Mobile is deploying LTE-U technology from Ericsson and Nokia, who had their equipment certified by the FCC today. Further Reading LTE over Wi-Fi spectrum sets up industry-wide fight over interference \nLTE-U will help T-Mobile achieve its goal of offering gigabit LTE speeds, the carrier said. \nVerizon Wireless is also planning to use LTE-U. The company said in September that it is \"eager to deploy\" the technology and developed an equipment testing plan , but it's not clear when a Verizon deployment will happen. \nCellular carriers in the US generally hold exclusive licenses to spectrum, while Wi-Fi operates in unlicensed frequencies. Anyone can operate in unlicensed spectrum without an FCC license as long as they use certified radio equipment and comply with power limits and other technical requirements. \nâ€œLTE-U allows wireless providers to deliver mobile data traffic using unlicensed spectrum while sharing the road, so to speak, with Wi-Fi,\" FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement today. \nThe plan to bring LTE to unlicensed Wi-Fi spectrum set off an industry fight. LTE-U deployment plans drew opposition in 2015 from cable companies and the Wi-Fi Alliance, an industry group that certifies equipment to make sure it doesn't interfere with other Wi-Fi equipment. Industry groups worked together to develop a \"Coexistence Test Plan\" to prevent interference, and the Wi-Fi Alliance said it's satisfied with the result even though the new testing is voluntary rather than required by the FCC. \nPai said that FCC staff \"certified that the LTE-U devices being approved today are in compliance with FCC rules. And voluntary industry testing has demonstrated that both these devices and Wi-Fi operations can co-exist in the 5GHz band. This heralds a technical breakthrough in the many shared uses of this spectrum.\" \nT-Mobile has been discussing its LTE over 5GHz plans since late 2014 , and it likely would have deployed LTE-U earlier if not for the controversy over potential interference. \n\"LTE-U devices and equipment intelligently tap into and share underutilized unlicensed spectrum without affecting other users on the same band, including those using conventional Wi-Fi,\" T-Mobile said today. \"LTE-U constantly seeks the least utilized channels to maximize efficiency and performance for everyone. As demand on the Wi-Fi network increases, LTE-U backs off, and as Wi-Fi demand wanes, customers can tap into that unused capacity for LTE.\" Jon Brodkin Jon is Ars Technica's senior IT reporter, covering the FCC and broadband, telecommunications, wireless technology, and more.
