His lawsuit also alleged the company failed to file Depp's taxes on time, costing him $5.7 million in penalties. \nTuesday's countersuit said Depp's tax returns were always filed on time, and taxes were paid when the star had money available to pay them. \nThe company handled his finances from 1999 until early 2016, an especially lucrative period in the actor's career.
