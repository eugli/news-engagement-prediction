And then in a bizarre twist, a hit-and-run driver mowed Jones down — killing him. \nJones was struck and dragged several hundred feet by a passing Acura around 4:20 a.m. The driver abandoned his car and ran off, officials said. \nDriver Starlyn Colon-Burgess, 19, of Queens, was later arrested and charged with leaving the scene of a fatal accident, police said. \nDrunken driver was going 75 mph before fatal Bronx wreck \nThe victim’s cousin, Terrell Riddick, said he was with Jones early Saturday before their black Infiniti sedan bumped into a gray Nissan Murano SUV. He said they were returning from a friend’s house when the accident occurred, with Jones riding as a passenger in the Infiniti. \nAccording to police, both cars pulled over to the side of the eastbound parkway after the collision, with the occupants climbing out to settle the beef. \nOne of the men from inside the Murano clocked Jones, who fell to the ground and was then run over by Colon-Burgess’ vehicle, cops said. The helpless man was dragged by the Acura until Colon-Burgess pulled over, dumped the car and ran, cops said. \nWhen police arrived, they found Jones’ badly battered body. He died at the scene. Both cars involved in the initial accident fled the scene, although the drivers were later located by police. No charges were immediately leveled against either of those drivers. \nMan struck by hit-and-run driver after fainting in Midtown street \nA dozen tearful relatives, including Jones’ mother and Riddick, gathered hours later to mourn a man remembered as a stylish dresser, a spontaneous dancer and a devoted son. \n“What a loving child,” said mom Valerie Jones, 51, “He was just a loving person ... He didn’t get into trouble. He just went out on the weekends, but he always came back home.” \nJones lived with his mother, his grandmother and his sister, protecting all three. \n“He was confident,” recalled cousin Recina Lee. “Very funny. When Christmas came, he was dancing in the room” \nHassan Jones served in the Army between 2009 and 2014, remaining in the reserves after he left. He was studying security management at the TCI College of Technology near Penn Station at the time of his death. \n“I lost my brother,” said Riddick, 28, who declined to discuss the details of the deadly incident because of the ongoing NYPD investigation. \n“We hung out every weekend, without fail,” Riddick continued. “He was a good guy. Funny, stylish. He was the life of the party. If he was here, everyone would be laughing.” \nInstead, his mother was left to fight back tears inside the Ozone Park, Queens, apartment. \n“There’s so many things,” she said. “He was a momma’s boy. And everyone told him that. He battled for us. He was just a loving, loving person.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T07:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:25:09.824+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
