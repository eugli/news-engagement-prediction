Rex Features The sisters shared a giggle as they stopped on the red carpet PA:Press Association 6 The girls got into position as they stopped for the cameras \nJordan, 28, also wore a long black dress but hers was without decoration, a simple choker around her neck completing the look. \nShe too wore her long hair loose and she looked over the moon and proud as punch to be at her sister’s side. \nNo doubt Jordan will be giving her full support to her older sibling who this year is nominated for Best British Female Solo Artist.
