But not every new venture has been a success. Here's what Branson says he learned from eight of his biggest failures. Student Magazine \nBranson's first venture was a magazine run by students. He envisioned the Student brand would eventually include travel companies and banks. When a potential acquisition failed, it was for the best--the acquirer didn't share Branson's big vision. Virgin Records' Legal Trouble \nIn 1971, Branson sold discs at Virgin Records that were designated for export--thus avoiding a 33 percent tax. After getting caught, Branson was slapped with a Â£60,000 fine. After the incident, Branson knew he needed to get more serious about the business. Virgin Cola \nBranson tried to put Coca-Cola out of business with the launch of Virgin Cola in 1994. But business fizzled by 2012, and Branson said that Virgin made the mistake of not offering something \" radically different enough \" from Coca-Cola. Virgin Cars \nFrom 2000 to 2005, the Virgin Group had a little-known site where people could buy and sell cars. Branson said that he thought Virgin Cars failed because he had the \" wrong angle ,\" and he should have explored an auto business centered around sustainability. VirginStudent.com \nA precursor to Facebook and MySpace, VirginStudent, launched in 2000, didn't gain traction quickly enough, and was shut down in 2005. In a blog post , Branson said that the venture did open his eyes to how powerful social media would become one day. Virgin Pulse \nVirgin knew that it had to come up with a competing product as Apple's iPod started to take off in 2004. But by the time Virgin Pulse was out, it was already too late. Branson said the experience taught the team not to be afraid to exit markets too early. Virgin Brides \nBranson publicized the 1996 launch of Virgin's bridal store by dressing up as a bride. By 2005, Virgin Brides was no more. Branson mused that it failed because \" there aren't many virigin brides ,\" or because pictures of him in a dress were a turn-off.
