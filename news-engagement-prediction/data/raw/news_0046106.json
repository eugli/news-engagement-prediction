Shear twitter TWEET More \nWashington: The US Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday released a set of documents translating President Donald Trump's executive orders on immigration and border security into policy, bringing a major shift in the way the agency enforces the nation's immigration laws. \nUnder the Obama administration, people in the country illegally who are convicted of serious crimes were the priority for removal. Now, immigration agents, customs officers and border patrol agents have been directed to remove anyone convicted of any criminal offence.

More videos Trump to restrict immigration, build wall \nUS President Donald Trump moves to temporarily block immigrants from seven Middle Eastern countries and to construct a Mexican border wall. \nThat includes people convicted of fraud in any official matter before a governmental agency and people who \"have abused any program related to receipt of public benefits.\" \nThe policy also calls for an expansion of expedited removals, allowing Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to deport more people immediately. Under the Obama administration, expedited removal was used only within 160 km of the border for people who had been in the country no more than 14 days. Now it will include those who have been in the country for up to two years, and located anywhere in the nation.

With an estimated 11 million people in the country illegally, the government has long had to set narrower priorities, given the constraints on staffing and money. \nIn the so-called guidance documents released on Tuesday, the department is directed to begin the process of hiring 10,000 new immigration and customs agents, expanding the number of detention facilities and creating an office within Immigration and Customs Enforcement to help families of those killed by people in the country illegally. Trump had some of those relatives address his rallies in the campaign, and several were present when he signed an executive order on immigration in January at the Department of Homeland Security.

The effort, called the 287g program, was scaled back during the Obama administration. \nThe program faces resistance from many states and dozens of so-called sanctuary cities, which have refused to allow their law enforcement workers to help round up people in the country illegally.
