Drake helps streaming surpass U.S. digital music sales \nHold on, Drake's going home — to his Bridle Path mansion. \nThe chart-topping Toronto rapper recently gave fans a sneak peek of his new digs on Instagram, posting an overhead photo of the mansion-in-progress. \nAs CBC Toronto previously reported, a numbered company linked to Drake bought the property — in one of the city's most swankiest neighbourhoods — for $6.7 million. \n\"Manifested this one from time,\" Drake wrote on the Instagram post. That's the smile of a man who's building a multi-million dollar mansion in one of Toronto's swankiest neighbourhoods. (Mark Blinch/Reuters) \nAnd it seems people want a piece of the action. \n\"Are you looking for an insulator, for your new house? My crew and I are always looking to take on new jobs, and can start any time you are ready,\" reads one comment. \nAnother Toronto-based company offered their services in \"landscape design work or maintenance,\" but acknowledged their Instagram reach-out is a \"long shot.\" \nOthers took a more blunt approach. \n\"You shoulda hired me actually,\" wrote someone with the username aaleks_kg. \n\"I'll build you a luxury pool,\" said rodmartinez22. \nAnd shy_graciela didn't hold back, either: \"Can I come to the house warming(?)\" \nAccording to Forbes , Drake's net worth is around $60 million, so chances are he already has landscaping companies and housewarming attendees lined up.
