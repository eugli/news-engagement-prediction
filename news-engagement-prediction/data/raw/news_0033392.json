Keith O'Shea \nThey were then directed to a home nearby where they found Mr Ward, who had suffered serious injuries. \nThere was blood on the door frame, and Mr Ward had suffered deep cuts to his head. \nBut he refused to co-operate with the police and discharged himself from hospital on his first visit, returning the next day to get his cuts treated. Read More \nPolice made further enquiries and tracked down CCTV footage from the street which showed Keith O’Shea chasing Mr Ward before catching up with him, pinning him to the ground and hitting him with a claw hammer five times. \nMr Ward lays lifeless for several minutes before he gets up. \nThe footage then shows Rachel O’Shea re-emerge, pouring water on Mr Ward’s head, in what Judge Martin Steiger described as a ‘contemptuous attempt to revive him into consciousness’.

Manchester Crown Court \nThe court was told that Mr Ward, aged in his 40s, has a ‘significant’ criminal record. \nBut Keith O’Shea admitted he had gone too far. \nDefending him, Gwen Henshaw said the incident was ‘impulsive’ and ‘reactionary’ and that he is now remorseful. \nThe court was told Keith O’Shea was previously sentenced to 10 years in prison in 1995 for kidnap and rape. \nHe was jailed for 10 years again in 2003, for possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence. \nRachel O’Shea’s defence lawyer, Max Saffman, said she has no previous violent convictions. \nJudge Steiger said: “Some form of altercation had taken place between Rachel O’Shea and Mr Ward, a man in his 40s with a significant criminal record. \n“For reasons unexplained the male defendant went to his address, took a hammer and repeatedly struck him at a time when Ward was on the ground. \n“This was an extended attack with no fewer than five blows with a hammer. \n“Her [Rachel O’Shea’s] offending is much less serious even though she encouraged her partner to continue this disgraceful and shocking act.” \nKeith O’Shea, 43, of Constable Street, Gorton, pleaded guilty to wounding with intent, possession of an offensive weapon, and possession of heroin. \nRachel O’Shea, 42, also of Constable Street, pleaded guilty to unlawful wounding, and theft related to a separate incident. \nShe was sentenced to 18 months in prison suspended for two years and must undertaken a six month drug rehabilitation scheme.
