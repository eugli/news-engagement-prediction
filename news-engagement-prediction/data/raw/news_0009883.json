Then it shows her, bloody nose and all. Photo by: Video screenshot by Bonnie Burton/CNET Stormy new evil looms in 'Stranger Things 2' trailer Ghostbusters ride! \nDustin (Gaten Matarazzo), Mike (Finn Wolfhard) and Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) ride like the wind on their bikes while dressed as \"Ghostbusters\" characters for Halloween. Photo by: Video screenshot by Bonnie Burton/CNET Stormy new evil looms in 'Stranger Things 2' trailer Hopper still in uniform \nPolice chief Jim Hopper (David Harbour) tries and fails to keep something at bay. He still has his badge, but is he also working for another elusive government agency? Photo by: Video screenshot by Bonnie Burton/CNET Stormy new evil looms in 'Stranger Things 2' trailer Who ya gonna call? \nDustin, Mike and Lucas wear \"Ghostbusters\" costumes for Halloween, so fingers crossed the new season also includes upset spirits. Photo by: Video screenshot by Bonnie Burton/CNET Stormy new evil looms in 'Stranger Things 2' trailer Stabbing evil? \nHopper looks rather Indiana Jones-esque in this mysterious scene of him hopefully stabbing a monster with a stake. Photo by: Video screenshot by Bonnie Burton/CNET Stormy new evil looms in 'Stranger Things 2' trailer Dept. of Energy returns? \nHazmat suits could only mean one thing -- either the Dept. of Energy or another covert government agency is testing something strange again. Photo by: Video screenshot by Bonnie Burton/CNET Stormy new evil looms in 'Stranger Things 2' trailer How's Will feeling? \nWhen we left Will (Noah Schnapp) at the end of the first season of \"Stranger Things,\" he coughed up a creepy critter. Here he's being checked by a doctor as mom Joyce Byers (Winona Ryder) looking on. But is this doctor legit or working for the bad guys? Photo by: Video screenshot by Bonnie Burton/CNET Stormy new evil looms in 'Stranger Things 2' trailer All eyes are on Will \nWill is just one of the subjects on these TV screens. That begs the question: how many other experiments are there and who is behind them? Photo by: Video screenshot by Bonnie Burton/CNET Stormy new evil looms in 'Stranger Things 2' trailer A killer headache \nThis looks a lot like Eleven having a breakdown, but perhaps on closer inspection it could be Will? Photo by: Video screenshot by Bonnie Burton/CNET Stormy new evil looms in 'Stranger Things 2' trailer Drawing of doom \nThis sketch of the new monster that will invade \"Stranger Things 2\" looks a lot larger than the Demogorgon that terrified the characters last season. Photo by: Video screenshot by Bonnie Burton/CNET Stormy new evil looms in 'Stranger Things 2' trailer Knock, knock... \nThis homage shot reminiscent of the '70s sci-fi classic \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" has Will, or maybe Mike, about to open the door to see the ultimate monster. Photo by: Video screenshot by Bonnie Burton/CNET Stormy new evil looms in 'Stranger Things 2' trailer A stormy evil approaches... \nA better look at the gigantic monster that will be introduced in \"Stranger Things 2\" -- as well as in our nightmares.
