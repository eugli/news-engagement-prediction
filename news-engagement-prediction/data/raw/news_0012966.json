Article continues below \nThe first was the recently-retired and Future Hall of Famer Kobe Bryant. \nIf you recall, Bryant retired with five NBA championships, so he knows a thing or two about how difficult winning that many rings is. \nSecondly, LeBron James posted the following video message. \nDespite being seemingly at a loss for words at multiple points in the video, LeBron’s message was pretty clear. \n“A major salute to the GOAT Tom Brady on your fifth championship. I mean, as a kid, man, you dream of moments like that and you definitely did it,” he said. \nHe also made a solid point about how excellent the last couple of years have been in the world of sports. “Y’all just think about the last two years or last year or last eight months in sports we’ve had. From the Cubs to Clemson to Villanova to the Patriots, wow. It’s been an unbelievable chain of sporting events capped off by the Patriots tonight. Salute to the Pats. Salute.” \nJames also sent the following tweet from his personal account. \nIt’s tough to argue with that. \nFrom one G.O.A.T. to another, it was a pleasant way to connect the sports world and cap off one of the best championship performances in recent history.
