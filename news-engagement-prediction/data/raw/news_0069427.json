But one thing that many teachers and boy bands leave out about Billy Shakespeare is that he was one raunchy mofo. \nFor example, take the title of his play, Much Ado About Nothing . It’s talking about making a big deal over stuff that shouldn’t be a big deal, right? Well, yes. But, wait, there’s more! Back in the day, “nothing” was Elizabethan slang for vagina —since, compared to dudes, women have “nothing” between their legs. So Shakespeare was actually being kinky too and making a big deal about sex. \nAnd there’s lots more where that came from. 2 \nPASSAGE : BENEDICK : “I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be buried in thy eyes” \nTo “die” used to mean to have an orgasm. I’m dead serious. So in Much Ado About Nothing —which, again, is about “nothing”—Benedick is telling Beatrice that not only is he going to live in her heart but he’ll also leave his seed in her lap. With that said, Shakespeare never failed to pull out some dirty jokes. 3 \nPASSAGE : MACDUFF: “ What three things does drink especially provoke?” PORTER: “ Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes; it provokes the desire, but it takes away the performance: therefore, much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery: it makes him, and it mars him; it sets him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him, and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him.” \nIn Macbeth , Macduff gets a lesson about some of the problems with drinking, thanks to an alcoholic porter. Alcohol, the porter explains, makes you snooze and piss. And it also makes you horny, provoking “lechery.” But there’s an issue—whiskey dick. Drinking “provokes the desire” to get it on, but also makes it harder to get it up, thus “it takes away the performance.” Discussing his boner, the porter explains that although alcohol “makes him stand to,” it doesn’t stick around for long. 4 \nPASSAGE : “My soul doth tell my body that he may Triumph in love—flesh stays no farther reason, But, rising at thy name, doth point out thee As his triumphant prize—proud of this pride, He is contented thy poor drudge to be, To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.” \nLike most of Billy Shakespeare’s sonnets, there’s a lot going on here, so bear with me. Shakespeare’s sonnets were all about love and making love, as we see here. While his mind was telling him ‘no,’ his body is telling him ‘yes’ ( R. Kelly knows the feeling ). He eventually decides that his body can “triumph in love,” and he can just get kinky with it. Simply by hearing his lover’s name, a very particular part of Shakespeare’s flesh (yes, it’s his penis) starts “rising” and even points to “his triumphant prize,” which makes his dick so proud that he’d be fine with being his lover’s servant (“thy poor drudge”). Then he gets even kinkier. “Stand” refers to his erection, and “affairs” means a woman’s genitals, so that’s pretty clear. After that, his “flesh” goes on to “fall,” which refers to “detumescence ,” a fancy word that just means losing your boner after sex. 5 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:51:23.177+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
