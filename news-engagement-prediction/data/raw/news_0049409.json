(AMA/Getty Images) \nArsene Wenger admits he didn’t enjoy Arsenal’s 2-0 victory over Sutton United in the FA Cup. \nGoals in each half from Lucas Perez and Theo Walcott sealed the tie for the Gunners but the non-league side gave a positive account of themselves throughout the match and had three strong chances to find a way past Wenger’s men. \nWenger admits Sutton took advantage of Arsenal’s mistakes but believes his players’ mental preparation played a key role in their victory. \n‘We did the job. It is very different I must say on this kind of pitch. It was not an easy game at all,’ Wenger told BBC Sport. \n‘We have to give them credit because every error we made they took advantage of on this pitch. They played very well. Lucas Perez opened the scoring with a cross int he first half. (AMA/Getty Images) Walcott scored Arsenal’s second after the break. (Getty Images) \n‘It is basically division five and when I arrived here 20 years ago in division five they were not as fit physically as they were today. They were organised and had a huge desire. If we were not mentally prepared we would not have gone through today. \n‘I don’t really enjoy tonight because we absolutely had to do the job and it is tricky. It is important for the confidence of the players. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T05:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:36:31.173+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
