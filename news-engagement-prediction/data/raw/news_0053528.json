(photo credit:CONFERENCE OF PRESIDENTS) \nUS Jewish leader Malcolm Hoenlein on Tuesday called for international mobilization against antisemitism, as other prominent groups called on the US authorities to take action following the latest in a series of anti-Jewish actions across the country.The most recent string of bomb threats against Jewish Community Centers on Monday coupled with the desecration of tombstones at a Jewish cemetery in the St. Louis area, provoked a flood of concerned statements. Trump says antisemitism is 'horrible' and has to stop Hoenlein, CEO of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, called for the establishment of a world conference on antisemitism, similar to the international gatherings convened in Brussels in 1970 and 1976 to address the plight of Soviet Jews.Stating that statistics on antisemitism indicate that the situation for Jews in Europe is even worse than in the US, Hoelein ---who is currently in Israel for the organization's annual conference--called on Jerusalem to play a key role in enlisting international heads of state and other prominent world leaders to the initiative. \"A successful mobilization against anti-Semitism will strengthen the fight against all forms of bigotry,\" he said. US President Donald Trump was among those Hoenlein said should join the effort. Trump has been subject to considerable criticism over his response -- or lack thereof-- to the recent uptick in antisemitism across the country. American Jewish Committee (AJC) CEO David Harris told The Jerusalem Post that he has found the new administration's response to the phenomenon \"disappointing, to say the least.\"\"We're still at the stage of trying to get the White House to acknowledge the issue and call it by its rightful name -- antisemitism,\" he said. \"For reasons that escape me, until now it's been about generic words like \"hatred\" and \"intolerance,\" or about the president defending himself against non-existent charges that he's an antisemite. It's elementary: to combat a problem you first have to define it, and the definition of this particular problem is antisemitism, pure and simple.\"Harris said the organization strove to focus the government's attention to the growing danger. \"They have the resources to assess, monitor, and address the challenges far better than any non-governmental institution possibly can,\" he stressed. AJC also seeks to help \"mobilize civil society to the fact that antisemitism is a threat not only to Jews, but to the very fabric and fiber of American democratic values and ideals.\"Anti Defamation League CEO Jonathan A. Greenblatt too appealed to political leaders \"at all levels to speak out against such threats directed against Jewish institutions, to make it clear that such actions are unacceptable, and to pledge that they will work with law enforcement officials to ensure that those responsible will be apprehended and punished to the full extent of the law.‚ÄùWorld Jewish Congress President Ronald Lauder echoed this, calling for a \"strong and decisive reaction by the authorities at all political levels to combat it.\" Relevant to your professional network?
