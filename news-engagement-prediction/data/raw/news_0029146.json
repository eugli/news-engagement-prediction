The business case, completed in 2013, estimated the project would cost $11.5bn. It has already ballooned out to $16.8bn.\nThe audit found the merits of the project were not properly assessed before the federal government committed funds. \n“This situation was identified in departmental advice to decision makers prior to decisions being taken,” the auditor general found. \nIt found the upfront grants had been promised despite Infrastructure Australia and the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development warning the project was at too early a stage, and “could not yet be recommended for Australian government financial support”.\n“Ministers were provided with well-considered advice on the advance payment,” the auditor general found. “The advice to ministers clearly indicated that such a payment would be in advance of project needs.”\nThere were three milestone payments: $250m in June 2015, $450m in June last year, and $300m in November last year. \n“But those three milestone payments were designed and administered in a way that did not adequately protect the Australian government’s financial interests,” the auditor general wrote.\n“This was because, in order not to delay payments, milestones were agreed to after the respective event had already occurred or amended shortly before the payment was due to be made where NSW had not met the milestone.”\nThe audit found the concessional loan had failed in its aim to bring stage two of the project forward by two years. \nWhen awarding the loan, advice to the minister had failed to identify the costs and risks of providing a concessional loan. \nThat included the lack of any evidence it would accelerate the second stage of the project, and that the interest rate on the loan was set “well bellow” comparable market rates, and without any margin to cover the federal government’s administration costs or risk.\nThe audit found the loan simply replaced money that could have been provided by private lenders, a conclusion the department disagreed with.\n“There is evidence that Stage 2 could have progressed towards construction as planned without the concessional loan,” the report said.\n“The concessional loan was used as a replacement for the financing that could have been obtained from private sector lenders and through the privatisation of Stage 1 in 2019‒20.”\nIn its response to the report, the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development denied that milestone payments were made for work that had already been completed.\nTransport infrastructure costs blew out by $28bn in 15 years, says Grattan Institute Read more \nThe department disagreed with the conclusion the $1.5bn grant did not adequately protected the federal government’s interests, citing mechanisms to recoup funding if all three stages of the project are not delivered.\nAt a press conference in Canberra the Labor transport spokesman, Anthony Albanese, said that Labor’s commitment of $1.8bn to the project in the May 2013 budget was contingent on a proper business case and other conditions, unlike the Coalition’s approach.\nAlbanese said Westconnex was “the latest example of where the government has got itself into difficulty by ripping up its own policy … [to have] proper planning and approval by Infrastructure Australia before any project of value above $100m”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T13:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T10:18:03.930+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
