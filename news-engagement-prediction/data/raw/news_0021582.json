So, we just sat and talked, and I didn’t want to impose on anything he wanted to do ― he’s got his own ideas, I would imagine…He’s a very talented young man. In fact, I was listening to some of his music and it’s pretty good stuff.” \nDespite his comments on preserving his portrayal of the character, Williams went on to tell The Hollywood Reporter that he never envisioned anyone else helming the role. \n“Lando has been very much a part of my life for over 30 years,” he said. “When I go out and do conventions and stuff like that, even though people know me from all the other things that I’ve done, certainly [Lando] takes precedence. I just never thought of anybody else being Lando. I just see myself as Lando.” Giphy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T04:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:13:18.319+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
