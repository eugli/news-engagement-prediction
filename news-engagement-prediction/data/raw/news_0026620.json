Andre Drummond and Reggie Jackson (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 11:28 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 11:28 a.m. ET \nThe Pistons have put Andre Drummond and Reggie Jackson on the trading block, according to ESPN's Zach Lowe . \nDetroit has quietly explored the trade market for each of its franchise centerpieces, according to sources across the league, and come away disappointed with the potential return. \nDrummond, 23, would be a surprising move considering his presence around the rim. He's second in the league in rebounds per game (13.9) and is fifth in total double doubles this season (37). Plus, his young age makes him a valuable asset moving forward. \nMORE: Chris Childs: I could have knocked Kobe Bryant out \nAs Lowe explains, however, Drummond isn't becoming what the Pistons want from him. He says the big man \"doesn't try hard enough\" in many games, especially on defense. Coach Stan Van Gundy spoke with Lowe and even admitted Drummond√Ç \"needs to be pushed really hard.\" \nLowe doesn't expect a deal to be made for Drummond considering the lack of need for a player like him. Jackson, on the other hand, could potentially find another home. \nDetroit acquired Jackson in 2015 in a trade with the Thunder. He appeared to be developing into a solid player, averaging 18.8 points and 6.2 assists in his first season with the Pistons. But his performance has fallen this season, and it's why Detroit is looking to sell. \nNot only is Jackson not playing as well, but backup Ish Smith has looked good when he comes into the game. The offense flows better with him, so it makes sense for Detroit to move on from Jackson. But then the question becomes, what can they get in return? \nAccording to Lowe, not much, but the Pistons would \"settle for a lower return\" on the guard. \nDetroit is currently clinging on to a playoff spot, so if a deal does get made, it would for sure shake up the postseason picture.
