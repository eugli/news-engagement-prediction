External Link: Comparing life expectancy projections for women among industrialised nations \nDr Bennett said South Korea's projection was based on several areas performing well. \n\"[South Korea] has low levels of obesity and blood pressure — lower than most Western countries — has lower rates of smoking in women,\" he said. \n\"They have a very equitable health system, which compares for instance with the USA, where there is no universal health insurance, and therefore you get some groups in society being left behind.\" \nCompared to other rich countries, the United States' homicide, obesity, and child mortality rate are also working against its citizens. \nAmerican men are tipped to surpass 79.5 years,and women 83.3 years by 2030. Longer lives straining social security \nBut while living longer may sound tempting, Dr Bennett said a higher life expectancy does not necessarily mean an increased quality of life. External Link: Comparing life expectancy projections for men among industrialised nations \nIt could also put a strain on social and health services as they deal with an older population for longer. \n\"It's a very important issue that governments have to address now because there will be an ever-increasing cost to having an aged population,\" Dr Bennett said. \nThe World Health Organisation has been spearheading a program to encourage governments to develop policies for coping with ageing populations, according to Yvonne Wells, a professor of aged care at La Trobe University. \nShe said it is part of the reason why the Australian Government has been making some tough changes in recent years. \n\"As far as Australia's concerned, in many ways we are well prepared, but in others, there are gaps as well,\" Professor Wells said. \n\"We have a reasonable financial system to support older people, and this is one of the reasons the Government's been delaying the pension eligibility age and encouraging people to both stay at work for longer and to put money aside for their superannuation.\" While Australia enjoys a relatively high life expectancy for both men and women, there is still a big gap dividing Indigenous Australians from the rest of the country. \nAccording to Professor Wells, Australia's aged care services ranked well compared to other similar nations. \nBut she said Australians should be preparing for their future now to ensure they live not only longer lives, but better quality ones. \n\"Putting aside money for your retirement, having some kind of retirement plan — what you'd like to actually do once you're not going to work five days a week,\" she said. \n\"It's about staying healthy in middle age, smoking, diet, exercise — all those kinds of things are all intended to help Australians live longer and healthier lives.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T12:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T08:41:32.333+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
