Article continues below \nTroy Deeney was the scorer of the second goal, but it's fair to say the Gunners' faithful were busy concentrating on one of their own players and his brief cameo appearance. \nAaron Ramsey was on the pitch for just 17 minutes before he was forced off with an injury. Article continues below Kevin Nolan signs himself for Notts County \nHad Arsene Wenger's hand not been forced, there has to be a chance he'd have taken the Welshman off anyway, such was the level of his performance. \nKaboul's thunderous strike may yet be credited to Ramsey as an own goal, and the midfielder also played a role in Deeney's second having given the ball away in the build-up play. Fans furious \nNever one to shy away from giving his opinion on Arsenal's shortcomings, Piers Morgan quickly vented his disdain on Twitter - and it wasn't long before other Arsenal fans were joining him. Morgan's rant \nThat wasn't the end of Morgan's tirade either - when he starts bringing Donald Trump into it, you know he's completely lost it. \nIt remains to be seen whether Ramsey now faces a spell in the treatment room with an injury, but maybe he could do with a little time out of the spotlight after tonight. \nThe 26-year-old is generally having a season to forget. With no Premier League goals to his name, he's only found the back of the net once, and that was in the FA Cup against Preston. \nIt's no wonder the fans are losing their patience with him. \nWas Aaron Ramsey to blame for Arsenal going 2-0 down?
