After your career, what are you going to do? Stay living in Europe? To do what?” \n“It’s always tough to be African, because you can be the best African coach but they’ll never give you PSG, Barcelona, Liverpool or Manchester United.” \n“That’s why I say to all the boys: don’t turn down your country because the future of this world is in Africa.” \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T10:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T05:23:27.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
