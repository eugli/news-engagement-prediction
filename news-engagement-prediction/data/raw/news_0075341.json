PUBLISHED: 09:36, Mon, Feb 27, 2017 | UPDATED: 09:47, Mon, Feb 27, 2017 \nInter Milan's owners Suning Group have reportedly reached out to Antonio Conte to discuss a potential return to Serie A. \nItalian newspaper La Repubblica claims Inter want the Chelsea boss as they begin their summer overhaul of the club. \nThe San Siro team have parted company with two managers recently - Roberto Mancini and Frank de Boer - and they are hopeful Conte can bring some stability to the club. \nThe report says Conte may consider a swift return to Italy, despite his current contract with the Blues running until 2019. \nIt is said the former Juventus coach has a poor relationship with Roman Abramovich and could want to leave Stamford Bridge. \nConte is also disappointed that the Blues owner is yet to allocate him funds to spend in the summer. \nAnd the Russian owner has also denied the 47-year-old the six coaches he asked for, allowing him only three. \nAway from football, Conte is also said to be struggling on a personal level and misses his family who still live in Italy. \nâ€‹Intermediaries from Suning Group are said to have already reached out to the former Juve boss. \nAnd his arrival could hinge on current manager Stefano Pioli's ability to secure Champions League football for Inter next season. \nPiolo is under contract until 2018 but he could get the chop if he fails to deliver a top-three finish in Serie A.
