Story continues below \nThe 22-year-old Kelowna woman was taken to hospital by ambulance with what police considered to be serious, but non-life-threatening injuries. \nOfficers identified the driver of the Dodge Ram at the scene and detected possible signs of alcohol intoxication. \n“As a result, the driver was provided with a demand, who then provided a sample of her breath roadside which resulted in a fail,” Cpl. Jesse O’Donaghey said in a news release. “The driver was subsequently taken to the Kelowna RCMP Detachment where she provided breath samples twice the legal limit.” \nThe driver of the pickup, a 24-year-old Vernon woman, faces both driving prohibitions and fines under the B.C. Motor Vehicle Act along with potential criminal charges. \nShe is expected to appear in court at a later date. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T01:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T09:06:49.937+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
