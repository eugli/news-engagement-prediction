By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: February 27, 2017 2:40 PM Ramjas violence: Gurmehar Kaur decided to file a complaint with Delhi Commission for Women against cyber bullies. (Source: Twitter) \nDelhi University student, Gurmehar Kaur who has been in the headlines for the last couple of days for his stand against ABVP and their forced-on concept of nationalism, has finally decided to file a complaint with Delhi Commission for Women against cyber bullies. In an interview this morning, Gurmehar revealed that she has been getting threats on social media platforms ever since she posted the controversial video but the abuses are so many that even the police won’t be able to file complaints against everyone. However, it is being reported that she has identified some Twitter handles that belong to ABVP activists and handed over a list of these accounts to the Delhi police. \nGurmehar Kaur, daughter of Mandeep Singh started the campaign under #StudentsAgainstABVP. Kaur’s earlier video, which went viral in May, was where she said: “Pakistan did not kill my dad war did”. Reacting to her video former Indian cricketer Virendra Sehwag has commented, “Bat me hai Dum! #BharatJaisiJagahNahi.” Bollywood actor Randeep Hooda also applauded Sehwag’s reply. Don’t call me a Martyrs daughter if that bothers you. I never claimed anything otherwise. You can call me Gurmehar. \n— Gurmehar Kaur (@mehartweets) February 26, 2017 \nIn her Facebook status, she wrote: The brutal attack on innocent students by ABVP is very disturbing and should be stopped. It was not an attack on protesters, but an attack on every notion of democracy that is held dear in every Indian’s heart. It is an attack on ideals, morals, freedom and rights of every person born in this nation. \nABVP is organising a ‘tirangaa’ protest in the Delhi University for freedom of speech and reports of clashes between students have started coming. Today itself the Principal of Ramjas College said that his heart bleeds when Ramjas bleeds. “I appeal to the students to not indulge in any activity which spoils the name of Ramjas College. Let us resolve problems in a peaceful and constructive manner. I share safety concerns of the parents,” he said.
