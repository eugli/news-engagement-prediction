He emerged from the plane wearing a blue shirt featuring Roger Goodell wearing a clown nose, a Barstool Sports product that had the site understandably excited.

So needless to say, he’s enjoyed quite the victory lap in the wake of the Patriots’ incredible comeback win in Super Bowl LI. He’s always been a big fan of Patricia as well; apparently, Patricia is also a big fan of theirs. \nNew England may have gotten “closure” with DeflateGate after the Patriots’ win and Tom Brady finally getting Goodell to hand him the MVP trophy. But if Patriots fans – and NFL fans in general – can unite over anything, it’s their hatred of the commissioner. That will never go away. \nMatt Dolloff is a writer for CBSBostonSports.com.
