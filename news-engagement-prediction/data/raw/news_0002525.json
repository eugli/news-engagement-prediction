Eight-year-old Nora was the daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American al Qaeda leader born in New Mexico who was killed in a US strike ordered by President Obama five years ago. He was killed by a drone on September 30, 2011, after the Justice Department approved killing him in a memorandum that was disclosed in 2014. The memo said: 'We do not believe that al-Awlaki's US citizenship imposes constitutional limitations that would preclude the contemplated lethal action.' United States intelligence believed that al-Awaki was a potential successor to Osama Bin Laden. Defense Secretary James Mattis said in a statement about Owens: 'Ryan gave his full measure for our nation, and in performing his duty, he upheld the noblest standard of military service. 'The United States would not long exist were it not for the selfless commitment of such warriors. 'I thank our gallant troops and their families for their dedication to protecting this nation, and I pass our respects to Ryan's family in this most difficult time.' Nora's grandfather, Nasser al-Awlaki, is Yemen's former agriculture minister and told NBC: 'My granddaughter was staying for a while with her mother, so when the attack came, they were sitting in the house, and a bullet struck her in the neck at 2:30 past midnight. Other children in the same house were killed.' He said she died two hours after being shot. He continued, 'They (referring to the SEALs) entered another house and killed everybody in it, including all the women. They burned the house. There is an asumption there was a woman from Saudi Arabia who was with al Qaeda. All we know is that she was a children's teacher.' The fate of the girl's mother has not been confirmed. However, al-Awlaki's brother-in-law was killed in the raid. This was the president's first clandestine strike, and not one that was originally ordered by former President Obama. It involved 'boots on the ground' at an al Qaeda Camp near al Bayda in south central Yemen (pictured) After American service members landed on the ground, a two-hour gun battle ensued. Some al Qaeda fighters were women, and they were among the casualties, reported the San Diego Union Tribune . Al Qaeda has claimed that 30 civilians have died. National security experts believe that the death of the girl will be used as a part of al Qaeda propaganda methods.
