Professors have urged Ramjas Principal Rajendra Prasad to intervene to stop the ABVP from entering the campus, Habib said. \nSlogans against the ABVP were shouted by the members of the protest march. Police barricaded the area and segregated the protesting students from ABVP members. AISA members Kawalpreet Kaur told the Hindustan Times that several female students had complained that they were touched inappropriately during the clashes. \nA seminar on Tuesday had been cancelled after ABVP members protested against the participation of Khalid and Shehla Rashid Shora. The talk was part of Ramjas College’s Literary Society and English department’s two-day seminar on “Cultures of Protest”. Stones were allegedly pelted at the conference room windows when organisers had tried to hold the seminar on Tuesday, without Khalid. Khalid is a student at Jawaharlal Nehru University and was one of three arrested in connection with a controversial Afzal Guru event at the university in February 2016. #WATCH : Clash between AISA and ABVP students over cancellation of JNU student Umar Khalid's talk at Delhi's Ramjas College. pic.twitter.com/YD15j8dMWr ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T12:48:09.127+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
