That included starting in left field for a pair of games in last year's World Series, due to not having the designated hitter available in Wrigley Field. \nThis spring, Santana has let Francona know he is still willing to play the outfield, if asked. \n\"I'm not planning on doing that,\" Francona said on Wednesday. \"I wasn't planning on doing it in the World Series, either.\" \nAs things currently stand, Santana will split his time between first base and DH with slugger Edwin Encarnacion , who was signed to a three-year, $60 million contract over the offseason. It will be a similar arrangement to last season, when Santana and Mike Napoli (now with Texas) each rotated between those spots. For Games 3 and 5 in the World Series, though, Santana started in left so his bat could stay in the lineup. Outlook: Santana, 1B, CLE Outlook: Plate discipline the key for Santana Carlos Santana's blend of plate discipline and pop will continue to be a force from a premium spot in the Indians' 2017 lineup \nFrancona said he does not plan on sending Santana to the outfield for any reps, for at least the early portion of Spring Training. The manager did not rule out giving Santana some minimal exposure later in camp, just to get him some work at that position. So, while there are questions surrounding the status of left fielder Michael Brantley (right biceps surgery in August), Santana is not being viewed as a replacement. \nEven so, Francona appreciates Santana offering to help. \n\"It's nice to know that he's very willing to do that. It's amazing to me, his attitude,\" Francona said. \"You don't see veterans [say that]. He just seems like he's in a good place, and it's fun to be around him. He likes what he's doing.\" \nSantana said he will stay prepared for anything. \n\"That happened last year in the World Series,\" Santana said. \"If he needs me to play, I'll be ready.\" has covered the Indians for MLB.com since 2011, and previously covered the Blue Jays from 2006-10.
