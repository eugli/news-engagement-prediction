Within months, Dr. Kermit Gosnell, who ran the clinic, was indicted in the murders of three infants. \nAccording to The Washington Post, Pennsylvania law bars abortions after 24 weeks' gestation. Gosnell's clinic, The Women's Medical Society, performed abortions as late as 24.5 weeks. Furthermore, it is believed Gosnell's diagnosis of the fetus' age may have been routinely skewed.   \n\"Gosnell had a simple solution for the unwanted babies he delivered: he killed them,\" a report obtained by the Post states. \"He didn’t call it that. He called it 'ensuring fetal demise.' The way he ensured fetal demise was by sticking scissors into the back of the baby’s neck and cutting the spinal cord.\" \nGosnell, who is serving life in prison for his crimes, has reached out to actor Will Smith in a plea for assistance.   \n\"I’m fond of asserting that there could never be a Men in Black if I had dropped you on your head,\" Gosnell wrote in the November 2016 letter to Smith, reports the Daily Mail. Smith's mother, Caroline Smith, was a patient at the clinic and delivered her now-famous son there. \nGosnell then makes the case that he is a victim of the criminal justice system and has been wrongly convicted. \n\"It was surprising to learn that my experiences with prosecutorial misconduct, misrepresentation by even paid attorneys and the 'frailties and inadequacies' of the Criminal Justice System are common to many, many inmates,\" Gosnell writes. \"My situation may be unique only in the documentation of the abuse. However, my forty years of clinical experience with community medicine and addictive disease can be enlightening in regard to mass incarceration as well as vocational lattices.\" \n\"He believes his case was a persecution by a Catholic-dominated prosecutors' office,\" said Ann McElhinney, who co-authored a book about Gosnell. \nNeither Will Smith nor his representatives have responded to Gosnell's letter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T09:01:07.234+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
