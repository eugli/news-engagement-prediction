'We will issue a strong statement to the French government for their affront against a Venezuelan athlete,' Venezuela's foreign minister, Delcy Rodriguez, wrote in a Tweet on Wednesday. Stuck back in Caracas, Solano's supporters started a GoFundMe page that brought him to Finland just in time to compete. The only problem was that he hadn't practiced skiing on snow, only on wheels in Venezuela's scorching heat. In the first race, a 10-kilometre qualifying round, Solano failed to finish. He completed the first 3.5 km in 37 minutes and 39 seconds - the same amount of time it took other competitors to finish the entire course. In the 1.6 km cross-country sprint he finished last in 156th place. As he struggled to stay upright the south american was forced to sit on his haunches The comical sight of Solano with his ski's apart and rear in the air entertained onlookers 'Embarrassing!' wrote one critic on his Instagram page, who went on to accuse him of receiving sponsorship from the Venezuelan government while countless go hungry. 'My friend,' he wrote in response, 'I swear I am not here because of the government. I arrived thanks to people who heard my story and supported me.' Still, many others are rallying to support Solano and his dream of one day waving the Venezuelan flag in the winter Olympics. 'I achieved a dream,' he said in his interview with the Norwegian newspaper. 'This pushes me to try more every day.'
