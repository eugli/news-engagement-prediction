PHOTO | RUTH MBULA | NATION MEDIA GROUP In Summary Wiper party boss Kalonzo Musyoka said his decision to ask fellow Cord partners to support him in his bid for the presidency should not be interpreted to mean that he is breaking away from Nasa. Mr Musyoka has been in the Kisii region for the past two days mobilising residents to register as voters.
