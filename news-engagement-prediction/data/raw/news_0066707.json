Since 2015, it had about a dozen contracts pulled prematurely as energy companies spend less on exploration and production during the market downturn and the company warned that \"very few\" new contracts were expected in 2016. \nTransocean's earnings are important for a market keeping a close eye on exploration and production trends. Low oil prices last year kept spending at a premium, though recovery is emerging as oil prices hold around $55 per barrel. \nSpending pressures remain for Transocean, however. Contract drilling revenues declined $93 million because of decreased activity and because the company was cutting the lease rates for its rigs. \nLooking ahead, Thigpen said inquiries from potential customers were coming in for Transocean. \n\"Looking forward, improving market fundamentals along with a steady flow of customer inquiries are increasing our confidence that the offshore drilling market trough is near,\" he said. \nTransocean last year consolidated its business structure by acquiring outstanding shares in its limited liability component Transocean Partners. The deal means the parent company controls a majority stake in the three additional offshore rigs.
