Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA crack Spitfire pilot who helped to support the legendary D-Day attack has died just 11 days before his 101st birthday. \nHero Tony Cooper cheated death time and time again as he clocked up a staggering 3200 hours on a stunning 160 operational sorties in the Second World War . \nEmotional tributes have poured in for the heroic airman after he flew the Spitfire, the most famous warplane of all time, throughout the last war as he put his life on the line dozens of times. \nMr Cooper also survived five forced landings, two of them at night, two on fire and one as a result of being hit by enemy ground fire. \nThe 64 Squadron flight commander amazingly escaped with just a bump on his head when his Spitfire crashed in Belgium in 1944 after the Allies had turned the tide of war.

Tony also carried out a string of ground attacks (Photo: Archant) Tony next to the Spitfire that he flew int he war (Photo: Archant) \nCodenamed Operation Market Garden, the heroic attack was immortalised in the Hollywood epic A Bridge Too Far, starring Sean Connery , Robert Redford and Dirk Bogarde. \nTony returned to his home town of Lowestoft, Suffolk, after the war ended in August 1945. \nHe became the fifth generation to work in the family wholesale business, WB Cooper Ltd. \nTony continued to lead an action-packed life, remaining active into his late 90s. \nThe keen swimmer loved to go to the gym to stay fit as well as driving his racy BMW sports car. Tony's adventures in the war were made famous (Photo: Archant) \nTony was also a devoted family man, having two children, five grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. \nA popular member of Lowestoft Rotary Club, he passed away on January 26 at Ritson Lodge Care Home in Hopton-on-Sea. \nDevastated Doris Day, Tony’s partner for nearly 20 years, said: “He was a real gentleman and a true Rotarian. \n“He was very special to a lot of people, as he always cared and looked out for others - he was just amazing.” \nShe added: “Tony was unique and one of the wittiest men with such a great sense of humour and was always full of laughter.” Tony next to his Spitfire, which is flew 160 times in World War Two (Photo: Archant) \nBorn on February 6, 1916, Mr Cooper was 21 when he was accepted for pilot training in the RAF Volunteer Reserve at Luton. \nFollowing progression onto a flying instructor’s course, he was posted to Canada in 1940, where he met his beloved wife of 56 years, Pearl Cooper. \nTony was awarded France’s coveted Legion d’honneur medal in 2015 for helping to liberate the country from Hitler’s forces. \nBarry Scaplehorn, president of Lowestoft Rotary Club, said: “Tony was a gentleman in person and in mind and in every way possible. He treated everyone with such respect. \n“He will be a great loss to the Rotary Club and to the whole of Lowestoft.” He was awarded France's top honour (Photo: Archant) \nTony’s proud daughter, Alison Bond, 66, said: “He had a zest for life and as a father he was just huge fun. As a child and young girl he was just great fun to be with. \n“When I was at school he would come to pick me up and everybody would want to speak to him as he was so outgoing. \n“He was somebody to look up to and we were very proud of him. We were lucky to have him as he was a fantastic father.” \nMr Cooper’s funeral will be held on Friday February 24 at 1.30pm in St Marks Church, Oulton Broad, and it’s expected to be packed out with family, friends and admirers.
