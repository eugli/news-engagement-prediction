(Jan. 31) AP Tom Brady (12) goes for a record fifth Super Bowl ring Sunday, and the anger surrounding the Patriots' dynasty may be waning. (Photo: Chris Humphreys, USA TODAY Sports) \nHOUSTON _ The New England Patriots are the team America loves to hate. \nThey’re cheaters. Bill Belichick has no soul. Tom Brady is too perfect – and he wears Uggs. And let’s not even start on how New England has come to look at the Super Bowl as its party, a second Patriots Day if you will. \nSo when the Patriots play the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday, it’s pretty obvious who the favorite is going to be. \n“Patriots.” \n“I’m a Brady fan.” \n“Patriots.” \n“New England.” \n“I don’t really care who wins but I’d probably pick the Patriots.” \nWait, what? Where’s all the animosity? The angst? The smoldering resentment? According to the annual survey by Public Policy Polling, the Patriots are the most hated team in the NFL for a second year in a row. Just 27% want to see them win the Super Bowl while 53% are rooting for Atlanta. \nBut ask fans wearing jerseys of teams other than the Patriots or Falcons here this week and you find that the whole “Patriots as the Evil Empire” thing might be a tad overblown. \n“I kind of want Brady to solidify his legacy and win his fifth ring,” said Colby Dukes, who lives in Houston and is a Chargers fan the other 51 weeks of the year. \nMORE SUPER BOWL LI COVERAGE: Is greed slowing the NFL's growth? \nAdmiration for Brady was a recurring theme among those who said they’re supporting the Patriots. After all, a win over the Falcons would make him the first quarterback with five Super Bowl rings, and might provide a definitive answer to the question of whether he is the greatest of in NFL history. \nThis will be Brady’s seventh Super Bowl appearance. Given that Sunday’s is No. 51 – LI for you Roman numeral fans -- that means the Patriots quarterback has played in almost 14% of all Super Bowls. He also ranks in the top four on the career list in touchdowns, yards passing and QB rating. \nNot bad for a sixth-round pick out of Michigan. \n“I’ll root for Brady and the Patriots. I want to witness greatness,” said Stan Kristynik, whose brother Clayton described the two as “born and raised to bleed (Cowboys) blue.” \nRod Rickett has been watching – and rooting – for Brady since his days at Michigan. He sees no reason to stop now, even if he is a Cowboys fan. \n“I remember seeing him rise,” Rickett said. “It’s nice to see him follow his trajectory.” \nPHOTOS: NEW ENGLAND'S ROAD TO SUPER BOWL LI Facebook Posted!

Week 1: Playing in their first contest without Tom Brady after the quarterback's four-game Deflategate suspension, the Patriots surprised many with a 23-21 road win at the Arizona Cardinals. Jimmy Garoppolo stepped in and was threw for 264 yards, though Arizona missed what would have been a go-ahead field goal in the final minute. Mark J. Rebilas, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Week 2: The Patriots were dealt more quarterback drama in a 31-24 win over the Miami Dolphins, as Jimmy Garoppolo threw for three touchdown passes but exited in the second quarter with a shoulder injury. He would miss the following two games. Greg M. Cooper, USA TODAY Sports Week 3: Even with rookie Jacoby Brissett stepping in at quarterback, the Patriots didn't skip a beat in a 27-0 win over the Houston Texans. The shutout was New England's first since 2012. Greg M. Cooper, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Week 4: The Patriots couldn't escape Tom Brady's suspension unscathed, as they fell 16-0 to the Buffalo Bills in the final game before his return. The loss marked the first time New England had ever been shut out at Gillette Stadium. Winslow Townson, Winslow Townson-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Week 5: In his first game back from suspension, Tom Brady helped the Patriots coast to a 33-13 win over the Cleveland Browns. Brady said afterward he felt rusty, but he showed few signs of it with 406 passing yards and three touchdowns on the day. Ken Blaze, USA TODAY Sports Making his home debut in 2016, Tom Brady once again was sharp with 376 yards and three touchdowns in a 35-17 win over the Cincinnati Bengals. Tight end Rob Gronkowski had a career-high 162 yards and one touchdown. Stew Milne, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Week 7: Ben Roethlisberger's absence soured what was supposed to be one of the season's marquee matchups, but the Patriots handled their business in a 27-16 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers. LeGarrette Blount powered the offense with 127 rushing yards and two touchdowns. Jason Bridge, USA TODAY Sports Week 8: A 41-25 win over the Buffalo Bills sent the Patriots into the bye on a high note. New England scored 27 points on five consecutive possessions to break the game open. Kevin Hoffman, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Week 10: The Seattle Seahawks got Super Bowl XLIX revenge with a 31-24 win over the Patriots. Rob Gronkowski, who would play just one more game before being placed on injured reserve, was unable to haul in a potentially game-tying touchdown in the final moments. Greg M. Cooper, Greg M. Cooper-USA TODAY Sports Week 11: The Patriots had little trouble bouncing back after their second loss, defeating the San Francisco 49ers 30-17. Tom Brady threw four touchdown passes in his Bay Area return. Kyle Terada, USA TODAY Sports Week 12: The AFC East-rival New York Jets gave the Patriots a close call, but New England escaped with a 22-17 win. Malcolm Mithcell caught the game-winning 8-yard touchdown with 1:56 remaining. Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY Sports Week 13: Tom Brady set the career quarterback wins record with his 201st victory as New England handled the Los Angeles Rams 26-10. Brady surpassed longtime rival Peyton Manning for the top spot. Greg M. Cooper, USA TODAY Sports Week 14: The Baltimore Ravens kept it close, but New England emerged with a 30-23 win to keep rolling. Baltimore rallied from a 23-3 deficit, but a 79-yard fourth-quarter connection to Chris Hogan helped put the game out of reach. Stew Milne, USA TODAY Sports Week 15: The Patriots stopped the defending champion Denver Broncos dead in their tracks with a 16-3 win. Denver couldn't break through against a staunch New England defense that forced three turnovers. Isaiah J. Downing, USA TODAY Sports Week 16: After a close call in the first matchup, the Patriots had little trouble dispatching the New York Jets in a 41-3 Christmas Eve rout. The win was Bill Belichick's 200th with New England. Bob DeChiara, USA TODAY Sports Week 17: The Patriots rung in the new year with a 35-14 victory over the Miami Dolphins to cap their regular season. The win clinched the No. 1 seed in the AFC and homefield advantage throughout the playoffs. Steve Mitchell, USA TODAY Sports Divisional round: The Houston Texans didn't fare much better in their second shot against the Patriots, falling 34-16. Dion Lewis had three touchdowns (receiving, kickoff return, running) and New England's defense once again flustered Brock Osweiler. James Lang, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen AFC Championship Game: Tom Brady and Bill Belichick sealed their seventh trip to the Super Bowl with a 36-17 romp against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Tom Brady threw for a franchise playoff-high 384 yards, while Pittsburgh struggled to keep pace with Le'Veon Bell sidelined midway through the game. James Lang, USA TODAY Sports Like this topic?

In fact, not hating the Patriots is probably grounds for eviction from New Jersey. Or at least would require your neighbors to shun you. \nMORE SUPER BOWL LI COVERAGE: Matt Ryan's coronation could be complete if Falcons win Super Bowl \nBut Sullivan also has a point. With their seventh Super Bowl appearance since 2002, the Patriots have become the NFL’s equivalent of the New York Yankees. While there is something impressive about witnessing a dynasty -- see the Chicago Bulls during the Jordan Era, UCLA in the Wooden years or the Montreal Canadiens juggernaut from the early 1950s through the late 1970s – it also can get a little, how shall I put this? Boring. \n“The Patriots have so many rings,” said Antonio Gonzalez, a Houston Texans fan. \nThe Patriots don’t always make themselves easy to love, either. The players come off as buttoned-down and boring, and Belichick acts as if he’s being asked to give away state secrets anytime he’s asked, well, anything. \nIt’s like watching a Fortune 500 company operate – only on the football field. \nAnd then there are the scandals. Spygate, Deflategate. If there’s a way to bend – or break -- the rules, it seems as if Belichick and the Patriots find it. \n“They’re cheaters. They’re deflators,” said Christine Schmidt, a diehard Denver Broncos fan. \nThey’re also in the Super Bowl. Again. Reject the hate. Embrace the love. \nFollow Armour on Twitter @nrarmour \nPHOTOS: ATLANTA'S ROAD TO SUPER BOWL LI Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Jason Getz, USA TODAY Sports Week 2: The Falcons outlasted the Oakland Raiders in a wild one thanks to Taylor Gabriel's 8-yard touchdown catch on a tipped pass. Atlanta's defense held on a fourth-and-2 run to help wrap up the first win of the year. Cary Edmondson, USA TODAY Sports Week 3: The depth of the Falcons' offense began to show in a 45-23 win over the New Orleans Saints. Running back Tevin Coleman scored three touchdowns, while Devonta Freeman had 207 yards from scrimmage. Derick E. Hingle, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Week 4: Julio Jones and Matt Ryan both exploded for record days in Atlanta's 48-33 win over the defending NFC-champion Carolina Panthers. Jones finished with a franchise-record 300 receiving yards on 12 catches, falling just short of the NFL record of 336, while Ryan's 503 passing yards were also a team best. Jason Getz, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Week 5: Atlanta handed the defending Super Bowl-champion Denver Broncos their first loss despite a less explosive output from its offense. The Falcons rattled rookie Paxton Lynch, who was making his first start at QB for the Broncos, and relied on a steady output from its running backs to seal the win. Ron Chenoy, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Week 6: Dan Quinn's return to Seattle ended in disappointment as the Falcons fell 26-24 to the Seahawks amid controversy. Richard Sherman appeared to interfere with Julio Jones on a deep fourth-and-10 pass in the final two minutes, but officials did not call a penalty. Joe Nicholson, USA TODAY Sports Week 7: A wild comeback left the Falcons stunned in a 33-30 overtime loss to the San Diego Chargers. Atlanta held at 27-10 lead but couldn't hold on, and Josh Lambo kicked the game-winning field goal in overtime. Dale Zanine, USA TODAY Sports Week 8: A 33-32 last-second win over the Green Bay Packers broke Atlanta out of its two-game slide. Mohamed Sanu's 11-yard touchdown catch in the final minute gave the Falcons the final edge.

Matt Ryan threw for 344 yards and four touchdowns to help the Falcons extend their NFC South lead.

Ryan Mathews ran for two touchdowns and the Falcons had to settle for three field goals. Eric Hartline, USA TODAY Sports Week 12: Taylor Gabriel emerged as the Falcons' newest weapon in a 38-19 win over the Arizona Cardinals. The diminutive receiver and free agent pickup took two short passes for touchdowns and had four receptions for 75 yards. Jason Getz, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Week 13: Eric Berry proved to be a worthy foe for the Falcons, as the Kansas City Chiefs escaped with a 29-28 win. Berry returned one interception and became the first player to return a two-point conversion for a score to seal Kansas City's win. Jason Getz, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Week 14: Atlanta's defense got in on the scoring in a 42-14 rout of the Los Angeles Rams. Deion Jones returned an interception for a touchdown, and Vic Beasley forced a Jared Goff fumble that he scooped up for a score. Jayne Kamin-Oncea, USA TODAY Sports Week 15: Devonta Freeman took control in the Falcons' 41-13 win over the San Francisco 49ers. Freeman ran for 139 rushing yards and three touchdowns in the romp. Dale Zanine, USA TODAY Sports Week 16: A balanced offensive effort helped the Falcons ease past the Carolina Panthers in a 33-16 win. Atlanta intercepted Cam Newton twice and held him to 198 yards. Bob Donnan, USA TODAY Sports Week 17: The Falcons put the finishing touches on their NFC South title with a 38-32 win over the New Orleans Saints. Atlanta clinched the No. 2 seed in the NFC and a first-round bye with the win.

Jason Getz, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen NFC Championship Game: Atlanta sealed just its second-ever trip to the Super Bowl with a 44-21 thrashing of the Green Bay Packers.
