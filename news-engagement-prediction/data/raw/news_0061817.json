Close Trump bans New York times journalists from briefing UP NEXT VIDEO Trump bans New York times journalists from briefing \nReporters for CNN, The New York Times, Politico, The Los Angeles Times and BuzzFeed were blocked from the session on Friday. \nSpicer's off-camera briefing, or \"gaggle,\" replaced the usual televised daily news briefing on Friday in the White House briefing room. He did not say why those particular news organisations were excluded, a decision which drew strong protests. \nReuters was included in the session, along with about 10 other news organisations, including Bloomberg and CBS. Donald Trump later refreshed his attacks on the media as the \"enemy of the people\".

We want to make sure we answer your questions, but we don't need to do everything on camera every day,\" he said. \nAssociated Press and Time magazine reporters walked out of the briefing when hearing that others had been barred. \nOff-camera gaggles are not unusual. Florida mosque fire was arson, say officials \nThe White House often invites handpicked outlets in for briefings, typically for specific topics. But briefings and gaggles in the White House are usually open to all outlets and they are free to ask anything. \nA pool reporter from Hearst Newspapers was included in Friday's gaggle, White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said, and was preparing a pool report for distribution to the entire press corps. Media outlets allowed into the gaggle also shared their audio with others. \nPresident Donald Trump has regularly attacked the media. Earlier on Friday, at a gathering of conservative activists, he heaped criticism on news organisations that he said provide \"fake news\" and called them an \"enemy\" of the American people. \nSpicer's decision drew a sharp response from some of the media outlets that were excluded.

Free media access to a transparent government is obviously of crucial national interest.\" \nThe White House Correspondents Association also protested. \n\"The WHCA board is protesting strongly against how today's gaggle is being handled by the White House,\" said Jeff Mason, president of the association and a Reuters reporter. \nTrump says some news organisations lie and on Friday denounced their use of anonymous sources. Critics say Trump's attacks endanger press freedoms. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T08:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T07:23:58.563+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
