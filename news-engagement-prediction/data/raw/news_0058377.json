STACY SQUIRES / FAIRFAX NZ \nPeople gather at the new earthquake memorial in Christchurch. \nWhen New Zealand Cricket decided to hold its minute silence before the match today, rather than during it, it was a small but perhaps significant sign that the 2011 earthquake is beginning to fade from memory. \nIn contrast, the minute's silence was observed at the Hagley Oval last year when New Zealand was playing a test against Australia. In saying that, 12:51 happened to fall during the lunch break. \nBlack Caps communication manager Callum Elder said New Zealand Cricket made the decision not to hold a minute's silence during the match, and instead acknowledge the earthquake prior to the match. JOSEPH JOHNSON / FAIRFAX NZ \nDeb Conley and Lauren Stewart touch the name of their step daughter and step sister, Rachel Conley who was killed in the Christchurch February 22 2011 earthquake. \n\"The silence was held prior to the start of the match, before the players went out. The players are also wearing black armbands.\" Ad Feedback \nHe said the silence was for about 30 seconds â€“ another small yet potentially significant step towards consigning the earthquake to history. \nWhen asked why the minute's silence wasn't at 12:51, Elder said it was normal to do it prior to a sporting event. 1 NEWS \nBill English says the memorial was unveiled to commemorate those lost in the Christchurch earthquakes can be a place to inspire hope. \n\"The decision was made prior to the match to hold the moment's silence just before the players took the field. \n\"Commemorating or acknowledging is usually done prior to the start of an event. The match was in progress at the time of 12.51, though a message on the big screen did appear at this time.\" \nElder said Sky TV did not have an influence on the decision and that the reason they had a minute's silence last year was because it was between innings, which it wouldn't have been this year. GEORGE HEARD/FAIRFAX NZ \nBalloons were released at the site of the CTV building collapse. \n\"In this instance we thought it was appropriate to hold it before the match.\" \nSky TV said it complied with New Zealand Cricket's decision but continued to refer to the event throughout the match, including a weather report from the site of the new memorial unveiling. \n\"There were multiple references by our commentators and presenters during the coverage today. At 12:51 balloons were released over the city, shots of which we covered live and referred to in our commentary.\" Stacy Squires \nA woman sits alone looking at the wall of the new earthquake memorial in Christchurch. \nMeanwhile, people across the city revelled and recovered from seeing Bruce Springsteen in person as the pubs in Lincoln Rd tidied themselves up after a busy night. \nThere are still hundreds of people out there profoundly affected by what happened, for whom the earthquake will always loom over their lives. \nBut for others, perhaps its a sign that the city is finally dusting itself off and getting on to other things - like a chance to finally see The Boss live, or witness the Kiwis get revenge on the South Africans for their defeat in Hamilton earlier in the week.
