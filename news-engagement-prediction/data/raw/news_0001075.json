And not only because he used to play for Barcelona. Club ambassador \nThat’s because he is now employed by Barca once again with him becoming a club ambassador at Camp Nou. \nA club statement read: \"FC Barcelona and Ronaldinho have reached an agreement whereby the Brazilian will become a Club ambassador and representative at various events and activities over the coming years. \n\"Ronaldinho will also form part of the Legends project, a team of former players who, through matches around the world, will help to globalise the Barça brand and its values, and will take part in clinics, training sessions and institutional events, among other activities organised by the Club. \n\"Through FCBEscola, FC Barcelona and Ronaldinho’s football academies will be seeking different ways to collaborate both in terms of the brand and possible associations with the same. The player will also appear in the opening and closing ceremonies at some schools and take part in activities in which he will share his experience in educational talks.\" \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
