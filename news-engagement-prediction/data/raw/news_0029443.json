Labor has put South Australia in a perilous situation,\" Mr Marshall said. \nSouth Australia's renewable energy target began in 2009 with a goal of 33 per cent by 2020, however that was upgraded to 50 per cent by 2050 when the target was achieved early, in 2014. \nPort Augusta's Northern coal-fired power station has since closed, while Victoria's Hazelwood coal-fired station is due to shut in March. \nThe Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) is forecasting a shortfall in power supply in both South Australia and Victoria in early 2018. \n\"We're very concerned about AEMO's latest report, which shows more blackouts are on their way to South Australia,\" Mr Marshall said. \n\"There is a massive shortfall because Labor has done everything it can to drive out affordable, baseload power from South Australia.\" Plan would stop investment in SA: Koutsantonis \nEnergy Minister Tom Koutsantonis said abolishing the target would not help South Australians. \n\"All it would do is help the coal cartel, and it kills solar thermal in Port Augusta or any part of this state, forever,\" Mr Koutsantonis said. \n\"The dream of renewable energy that is dispatchable, that has storage and can be baseload, has just been pierced through the heart by Mr Marshall.\" \n\"Do we really want to put this future in the hands of people like [Prime Minister Malcolm] Turnbull and [Energy Minister Josh] Frydenberg, people who carry lumps of coal around in the Federal Parliament?\" \nMr Koutsantonis acknowledged that the state's renewable target had no mechanism, but led to projects that were funded through federal subsidies. \n\"[This plan] stops people from investing in South Australia,\" he said. \nThe Government also said there would be enough power in the state in early 2018, through increased use of the Pelican Point power station and its own measures still to be announced.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T01:35:26.159+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
