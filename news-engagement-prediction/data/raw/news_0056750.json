Milo Ventimiglia Pens Sick Note To Get You Out Of Work After 'This Is Us' Heartbreaker 1 hour ago — Milo Ventimiglia (@MiloVentimiglia) February 21, 2017 \nIf you watched \"This Is Us\" Tuesday night, there's a good chance you woke up crying Wednesday morning. \nAnd if you need a little more time to deal with the emotional episode of the timeline-hopping drama, don't worry — star Milo Ventimiglia has you covered. \nBefore the tearjerker even aired, Ventimiglia took to Twitter with a letter to make sure fans wouldn't have to bother with any day-after responsibilities. \n\"Dear Sir/Madame, Please excuse (blank) from work/school today, Wednesday,\" he wrote. “Last night was a very emotional episode of 'This Is Us.'\" \nThe actor signed the note as Papa Pearson, as a nod to his character Jack Pearson, aka father of Randall (Sterling K. Brown). You can listen to Johnjay and Rich every weekday morning!
