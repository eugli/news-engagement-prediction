Sara was a gifted actress with a unique voice. \n“Even when she was navigating the tribulations of Caroline Sterling’s love life, Sara’s deft wit and clever characterisation meant Caroline was never solely defined by her relationships but always as a fully rounded, intriguing woman of substance. We will all miss her both professionally and personally.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T19:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T15:01:37.302+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
