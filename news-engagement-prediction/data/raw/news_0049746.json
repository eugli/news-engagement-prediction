As Sweden itself was quick to confirm, no such incident had occurred — so they reached out to the U.S. to clarify what the president had meant.\nMedia: Brandpoint LONE STAR LEADERSHIP: Donald Trump may be unpopular, but Texas congressmen love him\nFor example, during Obama's first 30 days in office, Politifact rated one statement by the new president \"false.\"\nIn comparison, Trump's first 30
