Jones / Firefighter whose life changed after Bricelyn Street fire February 7, 2017 12:00 AM John Beale/Post-Gazette Two firefighters embrace outside a Bricelyn Street home in Homewood where three Pittsburgh firefighters died battling a blaze on Valentine's Day 1995. By John Hayes / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nA single tragedy could have defined the life of retired Pittsburgh firefighter Jerome Jones, had he let it. \nBut from the ashes of a spectacular and controversial house fire that killed three of his colleagues, Mr. Jones found a deeper love of family and a new appreciation for life. \nHaving survived the 1995 blaze and a kidney transplant, Jerome “Tiny” Jones died Jan. 30 at VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System in Aspinwall of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. He was 61. \nOn Feb. 14, 1995, while responding to a fire on Bricelyn Street in Homewood, a stairway collapsed trapping several firefighters in a lower-level family room with their air tanks running out. Mr. Jones suffered smoke inhalation injuries when he found firefighter Edward Wyland unconscious, revived him by putting his own air mask over the man’s face, and dragged him to safety. He was unable to reach fellow firefighters Patricia Conroy, 43, Thomas Brooks, 42, and Marc Kolenda, 27, who died of smoke inhalation. \nIn 1996, renters of the house Darlene Buckner and her son Gregory Brown were tried for two counts of arson, insurance fraud, related offenses and the homicide of the three firefighters. While testifying about the Valentine’s Day fire, Mr. Jones wept openly on the stand. \n“He was a true fireman,” said his sister-in-law Rita Gregory, a Pittsburgh actor and director. “That incident stayed with him for a very long time.” \nThe son of Mary Jones of the Hill District and Cecil Jones of Ohio (no prior relationship), Mr. Jones attended Peabody and Central Catholic high schools before serving in the U.S. Navy as an aviation flight director. He worked at several jobs in the Pittsburgh area before being accepted as a firefighter in 1978. \nA month to the day before the Brushton fire, Ms. Gregory held a surprise party for her sister, Kathryn. \n“All of her friends were women and I wanted her to meet a guy, so I invited a bunch of single men — a bunch of firemen — to the party.” \nOne of the men introduced himself to Kathryn as the firefighter who waved to her everyday as she was driving home from work. \n“It worked,” said Ms. Gregory, laughing, “and my sister fell in love with a really good guy. They were married for 22 years.” \nA major sports fan, Mr. Jones loved black and gold, following the Penguins and Steelers with passion and rarely missing a Pirates home game. He was an accomplished backyard griller and spent a lot of time with his four children, Ms. Gregory said. \n“After Brushton, he changed,” she said. “He seemed to have greater concern for his family and friends and didn’t take things for granted — like turning up the volume on life.” \n“[The fire] changed him in a good way,” said Ms. Jones. “He appreciated life more.” \nIn addition to his wife, Mr. Jones is survived by his sister Dawna Jones of Squirrel Hill and brother Tyrone Jones of Pittsburgh; sons DaVelle Mitchell of McKeesport, Terrell Jones of Brookline and stepson Brian Gregory of Atlanta, Ga.; daughters Jerche Jones of Morningside and Arielle Parker of Philadelphia; and three grandchildren. . \nA funeral service will be held at 10 a.m. today, at Corpus Christi Church, 515 Versailles Ave., McKeesport. \nJohn Hayes: 412-263-1991, jhayes@post-gazette.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T07:14:58.570+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
