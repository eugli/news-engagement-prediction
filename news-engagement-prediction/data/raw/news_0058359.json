It said anorexia was not a terminal condition and asked the court to approve force-feedings, requested by state Department of Human Services. The attorney general's office said the woman's depression could be treated using an experimental drug. More on this...

She told the court she would resist force-feedings, which are administered through a tube inserted through the nose and pushed down the throat. \nD'Alessandro said his client's bone density was comparable to a 92-year-old's and she would be at risk for injury if restrained. \nJudge Paul Armstrong on Nov. 21 determined the woman's testimony was \"forthright, responsive, knowing, intelligent, voluntary, steadfast and credible.\" He said the woman's parents, doctors, psychiatrists, court-appointed medical guardian and the ethics committee at Morristown Medical Center all supported her decision to refuse force-feedings. \n\"This decision was made by A.G. with a clear understanding that death was or could be the possible outcome,\" the judge said. \nArmstrong cited previous \"landmark\" cases where patients, their families, physicians, and their institutions were found to be \"proper cooperators\" in making difficult medical decisions. \nAs an attorney in the 1970s, Armstrong represented the parents of Karen Ann Quinlan as they fought successfully to have their 21-year-old daughter — who was in a persistent vegetative state after mixing alcohol with Valium at a party — removed from a ventilator so she could die with dignity. She lived nine more years but never came out of her coma.
