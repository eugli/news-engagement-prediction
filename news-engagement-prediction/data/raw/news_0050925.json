Also Read: Samsung India leaks Galaxy S8 Plus ahead of March 29 launch \nWhile there is no confirmation as to the authenticity of the images, they do line up with past leaks and rumours. \nIn addition, Android Police has also gained access to a system dump, likely from the yet to be revealed Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 with illustrations showing the S8's on screen keys and basic design. These illustrations perfectly line up with the above images, further leading us to believe in their authenticity. \nWhat is really interesting is the fact that the system dump also mentions a \"DeX\" dock through which you could use your Galaxy S8 as a makeshift computer, circa Microsoft's Continuum. Massive pressure on the Galaxy S8 \nThere is a lot riding on the Samsung Galaxy S8's shoulder following the battering that Samsung's image has taken globally thanks to the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco and the recent arrest of the company's CEO on bribery and embezzlement charges. \nBack in August 2016, Samsung unveiled the Galaxy Note 7, a smartphone that was supposed to turn the Android-iPhone war upside down and be the company's answer to the dominance of the iPhone. However, widespread battery explosions led to a worldwide recall that seriously dented customer's trust in the company. \nRumors indicate that the Galaxy S8 will come with an all new bezel-less design, a scintillating 4K display and may come in two screen sizes - 5.1 inch and 5.5 inch. The 4K display comes at a time when Samsung is making a big push into VR with its Gear VR handset. \nAdditionally, the smartphone will be powered by a 3.2GHz octa-core Snapdragon 830 chip in the US and a 3GHz Exynos 8895 processor in other regions. We can also expect a new voice assistant codenamed 'Bixby'.
