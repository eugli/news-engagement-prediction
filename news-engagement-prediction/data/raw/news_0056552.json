The late 19th century and 20th century saw artists make huge leaps in painting styles, influenced by technology, such as the invention of the metal paint tube and photography, as well as changes in social conventions, politics and philosophy, along with major world events. \nThis list outlines many of the major art styles from the most realistic to the least.

From a little distance everything looks \"real\" but up close you will see that it is an illusion created by the skillful use of paint, color, and tone. The artist uses perspective to create an illusion of space and depth , setting the composition and lighting such that the subject appears real.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:49:47.389+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
