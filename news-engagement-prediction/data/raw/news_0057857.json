Now today we’re not interacting with the environment and we’re in very polluted places Dr Kara Hoover, University of Durham \nT hey are also at higher risk of mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. \n“Our sense of smell evolved in a very rich landscape in which we were interacting regularly with the environment,” said the Durham University academic. \n“Now today we’re not interacting with the environment and we’re in very polluted places.” \nA poor sense of smell also affects people’s ability to taste, which means they are likely to seek out stronger tasting food, which is very often salty and fatty. \nBy contrast, people with a powerful sense of smell are more likely to have lower body weight, previous research has indicated. \nThose who have suffered from a loss of smell often have increased anxiety over their own body odour because they don’t know if they smell bad or not, said Dr Hoover, adding: “They’re anxious about not being able to smell danger like gas leaks or smoke. \n“They suffer from poor quality of life and depression because they’re no longer engaging with food or loved ones in terms of their sense of smell.” \nShe said this anxiety increased the risk of developing more serious mental health issues.
