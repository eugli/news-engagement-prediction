Team president Phil Jackson has taken shot after shot at the star this season, leaving Anthony shaking his head and so mad at the entire situation that he wasn’t even mad anymore. \nAnthony told reporters, “I’m done asking why. I don’t need an explanation. I’m beyond the point of it bothering me.” \nMaybe. Maybe not. The Nuggets job was to take advantage of the situation, and they did. Jokic was masterful all night long, scoring 11 points in the second quarter, 15 points in the third quarter and generally being unstoppable all night long. Jokic made 17-of-24 shots, and added nine rebounds and five assists as his legend just continues to grow. \nHe was part of a Nuggets starting unit that dominated, all scoring in double figures and accounting for 104 of the total. Will Barton added 15 more off the bench. The Nuggets had 68 points in the paint. Knicks fans booed some more. They chanted for Dolan to be fired. \nBOXSCORE: Nuggets 131, New York 123 \nThe Nuggets, meanwhile, celebrated a much-needed win, keeping themselves in the eighth spot in the Western Conference. Still, Nuggets coach Michael Malone felt for his friend, Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek. \n“I have no idea how they operate this year, but Jeff Hornacek is a friend,” Malone said. “It’s not an easy position to be in. Winning games in this league is hard enough when everything is right. But now imagine trying to win games when you have all of the off the court drama going on. It just makes it exponentially that much harder. \n“Jeff’s played in the league. He knew what he was getting when he got this job. A great opportunity, but with this job heavy is the crown. He knows that and he’ll figure it out.” Tags: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T10:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T05:16:22.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
