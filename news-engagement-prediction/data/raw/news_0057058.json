But once we had to face the fact that we would lose him, we started thinking about how we could make his send-off unique and true to who he was as a person. Jordan McCole who died of cancer in February. \n“We talked to our friend who makes bespoke kitchens and came up with the idea of saying goodbye to Jordi in a 7ft yellow Lego brick - Lego being one of his obsessions. \n“We didn’t want to send him on his next journey in a brown box, we wanted the last image of him to reflect his life and if you knew Jordan, you’d understand why we did it. \n“He was our ray of sunshine and would’ve wanted his send-off to make his friends and family smile. \n“We made the decision that we wanted to inspire others going through the same terrible situation of losing a young person and facing a traditional send off. \n“It may have to be goodbye, but it can be your goodbye - their goodbye. Funerals can have laughter and creativity as well as love and grief. That’s what we want people to take away from this.” Read More Steam train rescued from 'death row' to haul passengers across Greater Manchester \nJordan was an aspiring Royal Navy aircraft engineer and was passionate about the outdoors. \nHe worked an ambassador for charity Climbing Out, which runs activity programmes for young people with life-changing illnesses, and sailed with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. \nJordan’s parents, Jannine and Tony, are now raising money in his memory for the Young Oncology Unit at The Christie. \nTo make a donation visit www.justgiving.com/fundraising/JordanMcCole .
