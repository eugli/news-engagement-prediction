As predicated by the NCMS, it was indeed the prelude for rainfall. In the video below, roads in Dubai are particularly slippery due to intense rainfall. Motorists are advised to drive carefully. Video by: KT staff Rain was also accompanied by strong winds in the capital, Abu Dhabi in this video from a KT reader. Majority of UAE roads are extremely wet today and motorists are advised to drive slowly to avoid any accidents on the road. Residents heading out to work today should bring their umbrellas and be wary of strong winds that might still occur throughout the day.
