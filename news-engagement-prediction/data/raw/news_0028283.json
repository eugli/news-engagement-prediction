Photograph: KCNA/Reuters View more sharing options Justin McCurry in Tokyo and agencies Monday 13 February 2017 11.10 GMT \nNorth Korea has claimed that it successfully test-launched a new medium to long-range ballistic missile on Sunday, as China voiced opposition to the test but rejected criticism that it could do more to steer the regime away from its goal of developing a nuclear weapon capable of striking the US mainland. \n“All sides should exercise restraint and jointly maintain regional peace and security,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters in Beijing, adding that China would take part in UN security talks expected later on Monday with a “responsible and constructive attitude”. \nThe Chinese Communist party newspaper, however, said that US demands that Beijing pressure Pyongyang into abandoning its nuclear and missile programmes were pointless unless Washington examined its own role in fomenting the current tensions. \nThe Global Times said North Korea had been angered by the “very real” military threat it faces from the US and its allies, and the imposition of tough UN sanctions . The editorial, published on Monday, said that by insisting that China take action, the US and other countries were ignoring the “root cause” of Pyongyang’s provocative behaviour. \nThe Russian foreign ministry described the launch as a “another defiant disregard” for security council resolutions and a cause for “regret and concern”. \nSunday’s test appeared timed to coincide with Donald Trump’s summit with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, and forced the two leaders to agree on an ad hoc response following their round of golf at Trump’s estate in Florida . \nThe Trump administration has promised to take a tough line against Pyongyang , but in his brief response on Sunday, the president said only that the US stood “100%” by its ally Japan. Abe described the launch as “absolutely intolerable”. \nStephen Miller , Trump’s chief policy adviser, said the president and Abe had displayed “an important show of solidarity” between their nations. “The message we’re sending to the world right now is a message of strength and solidarity. We stand with Japan and we stand with our allies in the region to address the North Korean menace,” Miller said in an interview with ABC’s This Week. \nNorth Korea’s state-run KCNA news agency said the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un , had personally overseen the launch of a Pukguksong-2 missile, which flew for about 500km (310 miles) before splashing down in the sea between the Korean peninsula and Japan . KCNA described the missile as a strategic weapon capable of carrying a nuclear warhead. \nKim had “expressed great satisfaction over the possession of another powerful nuclear attack means which adds to the tremendous might of the country”, KCNA said, adding that the missile had been launched at a steep trajectory out of consideration for the safety of neighbouring countries. \nIn claims that have yet to be verified, KCNA said a solid-fuel engine had propelled the missile – an improved version of a submarine-launched ballistic missile that was launched last summer – to an altitude of 550km. \nThe successful use of a solid-fuel engine would raise the stakes for North Korea’s neighbours and the US: the engines take far less time to refuel than conventional liquid fuel-powered missiles, and they boost the missile’s power and range. \n“They leave little warning time and therefore pose a greater threat to opponents,” said Yun Duk-Min of the state-run Institute for Foreign Affairs and Security in Seoul, adding that satellites find them harder to detect before they are launched. \nJonathan McDowell of the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics said North Korean claims about the missile’s engine were “a very concerning development”. \n“This new rocket is the type that we should be much more worried about,” McDowell said. “Solid-fuel rockets can be launched at short notice without much preparation. Large solid-fuel motors are difficult to make work correctly so this is indeed a significant advance by North Korea .” \nNorth Korea conducted two nuclear tests and more than 20 missile tests last year, but the last two launches, involving medium-range Musudan rockets, ended in failure, according to US and South Korean officials. \nMore UN sanctions and the quick deployment of an advanced missile defence system in South Korea are among the options open to Washington, but a US official said that any response would be designed to avoid raising tensions. \nThe Trump administration is under pressure to formulate a coherent North Korea policy amid warnings that the regime could be preparing to test-launch an intercontinental ballistic missile. A successful test would significantly increase North Korea’s bargaining power, since fully functioning ICBMs have the range to strike the US mainland. \n“These are serious military and security threats,” Jeong Joon-hee, a spokesman at South Korea’s unification ministry, told reporters. “Pyongyang has no intention of backing away from its goal of becoming a country with nuclear weapons .” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T18:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T13:15:50.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
