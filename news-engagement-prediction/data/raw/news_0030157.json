And it could also be endorsed by the House of Representatives. \nThe end objective is to prevent the illegal weapon importations and sales which fund violent bikie gangs and arm other types of organised crime and possibly even terrorists. \nThe government presented the legislation in the Senate last night and eventually voted for it even after significant Labor changes to the original version. \nBut in the final vote One Nation’s senate clutch of Pauline Hanson, Malcolm Roberts and Brian Burston, along with gun-fancying Liberal Democrat David Leyonhjelm, voted against it. \nThey held out even though a measure they strongly objected to — mandatory minimum sentences — was removed from the legislation. \nSenator Leyonhjelm told the Senate the government and Labor had not pointed to a single case in which current maximum penalties had been applied. \nBut he also didn’t like what might be called law-for-law’s-sake. \n“And nobody has paused for even a second to consider whether firearms trafficking is a problem or why it might be,” Senator Leyonhjelm said. \n“Could it possibly be similar to the situation with recreational drugs? Drug trafficking would not be a problem if our national policy was not one of prohibition.” \nBut back to One Nation’s Malcolm Roberts: “It may be hardly surprising that the feral, pest-hugging collectivists in the Greens hate the idea of private ownership of firearms, just as they hate all other individual freedoms.” \nThe final version, supported 54-4, provides for a new aggravated firearms trafficking offences, with a maximum sentence of life in prison. \nThis would apply to trafficking 50 or more firearms or firearms parts in a six-month period. It would make the maximum penalty for trafficking in firearms the same as the maximum penalty for trafficking in drugs. \nThe amendments were intended to “send a very strong message that trafficking large numbers of illegal firearms is just as dangerous and potentially deadly as trafficking large amounts of illegal drugs, and the same maximum penalty should apply”, a Labor source said. \nLabor frontbencher Clare O’Neill said today the gun trafficking problem in Australia was “incredibly serious”. \n“In my role as Shadow Minister for Justice, I meet regularly with law enforcement from right around the country. Guns is a very obvious and increasing problem,” she told reporters. \n“We know there are somewhere around 600,000 weapons on the illicit market. This is larger than we understand it’s ever been before. \n“There are now three million registered firearms in the country. And in fact, there are more guns in Australia today than there were when the Port Arthur massacre occurred.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T08:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:49:16.909+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
