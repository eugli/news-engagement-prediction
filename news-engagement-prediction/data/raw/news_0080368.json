More voters see Malcolm Turnbull as out of touch and arrogant, Guardian Essential poll shows Read more \nThis week’s Essential Report doesn’t match Newspoll’s spectacular plummet in two-party support but it’s trending in the same direction – and recent history tells us how that movie always ends. Voting intention \nBut there is one thing that makes Malcolm Turnbull look good. It’s Tony Abbott . \nAbbott’s intervention last week has unified Turnbull’s caucus and helped distinguish Turnbull’s lazy populism with a seriously mad right agenda. However, a trip down memory lane puts Abbott’s current delusional bid to reassert himself in quantitative context. Which of the following describe your opinion of the … \nOn each and every indicator of leader attribute, with one exception where the popular disdain is line-ball, Abbott is ranked demonstrably lower in positive and higher on negatives. \nEven with Turnbull’s steady decline in personal regard, Abbott’s numbers are significantly worse – net 20 points higher on erratic, net 16 on aggressive, net 18 on narrow-minded. \nIn terms of positives, Turnbull is up 10 points on vision, 10 points on capability and a whopping 21 points on intelligence. And this is after the catastrophic collapse in Turnbull’s own numbers over the past 12 months. \nBased on these findings, it is less than a fearless prediction that Tony Abbott won’t be re-claiming the Lodge anytime soon. But that does not mean Turnbull is secure in his position with his party or the broader public. \nTony Abbott’s critique of Turnbull does outline some of the core problems he is facing – it is just that Abbott’s suggestions for remedying these are mostly 180 degrees wrong for a government trying to maintain a semblance of public support. Take the following policy areas: Renewables \nWhile Turnbull loses credibility by submitting to the “coal club” and playing politics with the deficiencies of the national energy market, Abbott attacks him for giving too much support for renewables. As if professing his love for coal is not enough, Abbott would have the prime minister destroy the embattled renewable industry stone cold. \nBut as Essential revealed last week , public opinion has swung strongly behind renewables and Labor’s 50% target, while climate denial is at an all time low. Section 18C \nThe debate about 18C is a grand diversion confected by a rightwing cheer squad that wants to play identity politics when the band has changed tune. Every time this front opens three things happen: the PM is diverted from core business, the Liberals reinforce themselves as a party for entitled white males, and the PM is forced further from his “small l” liberal home. Indeed, the only person appearing to be caught by the 18C wedge currently is Turnbull himself, like the bear-trap that catches the hunter. Budget deficit \nAbbott snipes at Turnbull for not bringing the deficit under control, conveniently ignoring the political self-destruction he wreaked when he overreached with his first budget. \nThe so-called “zombie” budget cuts to social security payments to the poorest in society continue to lurk in unloved omnibus bills that define the Coalition far more sharply than the size of the deficit. \nAnd at the core of each and every spending discussion is the spectre of the proposed $50bn company tax cut, an expression of trickle down economics in its crudest form. The postie always rings twice: Abbott and Fahour give Coalition the smell of death | Katharine Murphy Read more Immigration \nThe boldest play last week was Abbott’s call for Turnbull to link immigration to housing affordability. Given Abbott managed to link Sydney traffic congestion to asylum seekers, this could be the one piece of political wheat (albeit cynical and divisive) within the chaff. \nThis week’s Essential Report shows a public grappling with the housing issues, narrowly favouring cuts to capital gains concessions, while professing narrow support for negative gearing. \nBut the more telling result in this week’s report is the totally mixed understanding of the impact of these policies on the actual cost of houses. What do you think would be the impact on house prices of limiting negative gearing and reducing the concession on capital gains tax? \nThe truth is the public is flummoxed by both cause and effect. As a policy battleground, housing affordability is Afghanistan, you are not sure what you are walking in to or how you are ever going to get out once you are in there. \nBut in staking out this territory, Abbott does offer a way to deal with a complex issue in a crude, divisive and negative way. And that ultimately is the line of continuity between Abbott and Turnbull, both presiding over a government that attained power by opposing things (boats, tax, debts), with no positive agenda for a nation living through profound change. \nThe rise of populism globally has made the job of government harder, but it is the underlying weakness in the modern Coalition (liberal or conservative? Globalist or nationalist?) that lies at the heart of these internal tensions and the broader public disconnect.
