Share via Twitter Tom Pennington/Getty Image Lady Gaga took to center field to perform during halftime at Super Bowl LI in Houston, Texas. And while she released a few previews on Instagram in the weeks leading up the show, there were plenty of surprises during the performance—especially when it came to her outfits (yes, that’s plural). At last year’s Super Bowl, Gaga wore a glittering ruby pantsuit with matching bedazzled eyeshadow to perform the national anthem. So, of course, she took it up a notch for her halftime appearance by wearing three different sparkling ensembles. She started the show singing “God Bless America,\" wearing a custom silver Versace onesie covered in rhinestones with coordinating knee-high boots. Her platinum blonde hair was pulled back into a French roll, which showed off her crystal-covered eye mask and bright red lip. But for her “Born This Way” performance, she let her hair loose, revealing waist-length waves. Later in the set, Gaga slipped on a bright gold jacket with spiked shoulders (obviously ‘80s shoulder pads are due for a comeback) to belt out “Just Dance.” Gaga finished out her Super Bowl halftime show with a fashionable nod to football. She wore a white, structured crop top that mimicked the shoulder pads athletes wear on the field. Except instead of cleats, she paired the look with holographic hot pants.
