Ten hammerhead sharks and 18 assorted rays also died. \nThe catch is up significantly from the first month of the trial, when 43 animals were caught. \nGreens MP Justin Field said the bycatch level was unacceptable. \nHe said the meshing trial should be abandoned in favour of non-lethal shark mitigation measures. \n\"It involves resourcing our lifeguards better, investing in community observer programs and developing personal deterrent devices,\" Mr Field said. \n\"These are the sorts of things that were recommended in the Government's own report. \n\"That's the direction we should be heading — away from killing sharks and other animals.\" \nBallina councillor Keith Williams, who is also active with Australian Seabird Rescue, said he was appalled by the figures. \n\"It's hard to see how it could be worse,\" he said. \n\"In the last month we've caught one of the target species but killed 32 other marine species that are not what we're after. \n\"Many of those are protected. \n\"This has been our concern with the nets all along.\" Surfers say nets 'definitely working' \nThe Ballina Council recently voted to ask the State Government to install an extra net at a popular surfing spot in front of the Lennox Hotel. \nThe President of the Le-Ba Boardriders Club, Don Munro, said he had no doubt the shark nets were working. \n\"We haven't had any more attacks since the nets have gone in,\" he said. \n\"I think it might be close to the longest spell we've gone for a while. \n\"The trial is still a trial and we believe that the nets are definitely working. \n\"None of us are happy about the bycatch, but just hope in time that reduces. \n\"Whenever a new net is put in where it hasn't been before, the bycatch — and DPI have given me this information as well — is always higher until things settle. \n\"Marine life start to realise that there is a net there. \n\"Humans need to be protected. \n\"It's [the sharks'] domain, but it's also a fact of life that Australian culture is about the beach and the ocean.\" \nThe Director of Fisheries Research at the Department of Primary Industries, Natalie Moltschaniwskyj, said the theory about declining bycatch rates was still being investigated. \n\"I'm not too certain how strong the evidence is for that,\" she said. \n\"One of the things that I'll certainly be getting my science team to do is actually start to investigate some of these hypotheses of the data.\" \nDr Moltschaniwskyj said every effort was being made to minimise the bycatch. \nShe said meshing contractors tried to check the nets twice a day. \n\"But it's obviously dependant on the weather,\" Dr Moltschaniwskyj said. \n\"In the afternoon the breeze tends to come up, so it makes it very challenging getting out to the nets in the second half of the day.\" \nThe nets between Lennox Head and Lighthouse Beach in Ballina were checked about once a day, while the net at Evans Head was checked 39 times over 31 days.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T09:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T07:12:18.641+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
