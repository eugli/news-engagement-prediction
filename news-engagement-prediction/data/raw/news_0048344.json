Bovis accused of pressuring buyers to move into unfinished homes Read more \nThe company’s boss on Monday apologised to customers for the poor quality of their homes and promised that he would “make sure [we] finish their homes to their satisfaction”. \nEarl Sibley, Bovis’s interim chief executive, announced the £7m “customer care provision” as angry home owners prepare to protest at the company’s headquarters. Finished home? Photograph: ROBERT ELMES \nThe customers, who had been left with issues such as faulty plumbing, no guttering, and half-finished tiling , had organised on social media to try and pressure the company to send builders back to fix their homes. \nMore than 1,400 have joined the Bovis Homes Victims Group on Facebook, which was organising an in the flesh protest at the company’s head office in Kent. \nSibley, who stepped in after the previous chief executive Dave Ritchie quit last month, said he would make fixing customers homes the “absolute operational priority”. He said the company had experienced a much higher number of “snagging issues” on new homes than it would normally expect and had conducted a “thorough and detailed review”. Bovis said it had seen a much higher number of ‘snagging issues’ than normal. Photograph: Helen Batt \nSibley said he had personally visited several customers homes to survey the problems and apologise in person and was “working with them individually” to fix the issues unique to their homes. He was unable to provide a figure for the average cost to fix the houses, or identify the bill for the worst-built home. \nSome customers will be paid back for urgent work that they have already paid for – several will be paid compensation on top of the cost of the remedial repairs. \nThe cost of compensating customers knocked Bovis’s full-year profits, which fell 3% to £154.7m, below analysts expectations. The company said its profits would fall again next year as it will reduce the number of units it builds by 10-15%. A snagging issue at one home. Photograph: Robert Elmes \nBovis built 4,000 homes last year but said 180 properties that should have been completed in 2016 have yet to be handed over to buyers. \nThe company’s shares fell 8% to £7.73 in early trading.
