People are usually reluctant to lend their cars, and a man in Thailand just proved why it is a bad idea. Earlier this week, a man borrowed his friend's $11.3 million (Dh 4.1 million) Lamborghini to show off at a party, but to his friend's horror - crashed it into a palm tree. The man jumped into the black Murcialago LP670-4 SuperVeloce after eating at a restaurant with pals in Bangkok, Thailand, with two friends, The Mirror reported. Shortly after, he lost control of the supercar, which became airborne as he drove up a steep part of the road. The Lamborghini ploughed the vehicle into a palm tree, clipping a bike on its way. The incident took place at around 3am in the night. The driver was unhurt but his two friends suffered minor cuts and bruises in the crash. Pictures from the site of the crash show the entire front and side of the sports car totally destroyed. According to the police, the driver would be charged with reckless driving, causing injury to others and damaging private property. Commenting on the extent of damage to the car and on the fate of the passengers, a rescuer said: \"The man who was driving had a face as white as a ghost. He'll be paying for the damage for a long time. \"It's a miracle nobody was killed because the car was smashed very badly. It will need to be sent to the scrap yard.\" It is noteworthy that a Lamborghini Murcialago LP670-4 SuperVeloce can cost around £400,000 in the UK but car prices are typically double in Thailand due to higher import taxes. The owner told officers that he had paid 40million Thai Baht for the car - around £900,000.
