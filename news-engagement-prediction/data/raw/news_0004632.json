The president accused Mr Turnbull of exporting the 'next Boston bombers' to the U.S. and hung up 25 minutes into the call, which was expected to be last for an hour, an unnamed source claimed. The prime minister refused to comment on the Washington Post report and suggestions their phone conversation over the weekend was hostile.

The U.S. president reportedly told the prime minister: 'This is the worst call by far' The prime minister refused to comment on suggestions their phone conversation over the weekend was hostile (pictured at press conference on Thursday) What is the Australia-US refugee deal? The Obama administration and Turnbull government struck a deal to resettle some of the refugees being held offshore in Nauru and Manus Island in November last year. There are approximately 1,250 refugees being held offshore. A large majority of those refugees come from Iran, Iraq and Somalia - all countries on US President Donald Trump's travel-ban. Mr Trump reportedly agreed to honour the deal, on the condition the refugees would undergo 'extreme vetting'. The U.S. President reportedly described it as the 'worst deal ever' in a heated conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Sunday. 'I'm not going to comment on these reports out of the United States about the conversation,' Mr Turnbull told a press conference from Melbourne on Thursday. 'Australians know me very well. I always stand up for Australia in every forum.' He said it was better to leave the discussion out of the public domain. 'It's better that these things, these conversations, are conducted candidly, frankly, privately. 'You may wish to speculate about policies and politics in Washington, that's not my role. My job is today and every day to stand up for Australia and that's what I do. 'My business is being the Prime Minister of Australia. That's my job. My job is to defend the national interest of Australia and to defend the interests of Australians.' Mr Turnbull insisted the bond between the allied countries remained strong through the refugee deal. President Trump reportedly told Mr Turnbull the refugee-deal organised under the Obama administration was the 'worst deal ever' (he is pictured on the phone to Mr Turnbull) 'I can assure you the relationship is very strong. The fact we received the assurance that we did, the fact that it was confirmed, the very extensive engagement we have with the new administration underlines the closeness of the alliance. 'But as Australians know me, very well, I stand up for Australia in every forum - public or private.'
