Only two of Aguero’s past 39 goals in the league have come against top six sides. Gabriel Jesus was outstanding for City on Wednesday night \nR eports in some quarters have suggested Guardiola could listen to offers for Aguero this summer, when a glut of new arrivals are expected. But with doubts over the futures of so many players and a flurry of departures in the offing, there are concerns about the risks of too much overhaul in the squad. \nClaudio Bravo was also dropped for the West Ham game. The Chile goalkeeper has struggled to convince since moving to City from Barcelona last summer, but while Guardiola is in the market for another goalkeeper with Willy Caballero out of contract at the end of the season, it remains to be seen if the manager opts to bring in a new No. 1 or an another understudy for Bravo.
