(CDN PHOTO/TONEE DESPOJO) \nLEGAZPI CITY — The Armed Forces of the Philippines has announced it has reduced the communist insurgency in Sorsogon to a point that the conflict has become manageable and that the entire province can now welcome bigger development projects to pursue economic progress and eliminate poverty. \nThe AFP declared the entire Sorsogon as “conflict manageable and development ready” when it came to its counter-insurgency progress, during a ceremony Wednesday. \nThe ceremony, which was held at the provincial gymnasium, was witnessed by Major General Manolito Orense, commanding officer of Philippine Army’s 9th Infantry Division; Lieutenant Colonel Randy Espino, commander of the 31st Infantry Battalion; and Police Senior Superintendent Ronaldo Cabral, Sorsogon police director, with Sorsogon’s local government officials. ADVERTISEMENT \n“The declaration of Sorsogon as conflict manageable and development ready is attributed to government forces (who)… have achieved substantial gains against threat groups (CNN or the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army-National Democratic Front politico-military organizations and other support systems),” said Cabral. He added that the number of rebels in the province has been significantly “reduced.” \nAccording to Cabral, there are 30 armed rebels in the province and that they import fighters from other fronts in their tactical offensives. \nEconomic development can now take place in Sorsogon, Cabral said. \nSorsogon Governor Robert Lee Rodriguez said the AFP declaration would surely boost tourism in the province. \nSorsogon is the fifth province in Bicol to have gained the AFP declaration after Albay, Camarines Sur, Camarines Norte and Catanduanes.
