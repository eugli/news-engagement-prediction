However, there is an even more specific scenario that is being discussed in the media, and the source is an NBA executive who has made a bold prediction regarding the Pacers and Paul George. \nAccording to CBS Boston , an unnamed NBA executive has told Marc Stein of ESPN that he believes the Boston Celtics will swing a deal for Paul George before the trade deadline. Stein went on to explain that Celtics general manager Danny Ainge is in fact trying to acquire a star player before Thursday’s deadline, and he is likely targeting George or Chicago Bulls All-Star small forward Jimmy Butler. The Celtics are also eyeing Chicago’s Jimmy Butler in case a deal can’t be made with the Pacers for Paul George.

Larry Bird has stated that he is not listening to any inquiries regarding Paul George, but if anyone is making legitimate offers for George, Bird should be listening — you never know when there might be someone who is in love with one of your players and is prepared to make a blockbuster offer that would be of great benefit to your franchise. NBA executives who say certain players are “untouchable” or that they won’t take calls for certain players are limiting themselves, and could be passing up good opportunities from time to time. \nIn sports, as in life, it is usually best to keep your options open. The Pacers don’t particularly want to trade Paul George; they would prefer to build a team around him. However, if Bird feels that George may not re-sign after next season and a huge offer is made for George this week, Bird should listen and evaluate the proposal. The Boston Celtics have the ability to offer a package of players and draft choices that would be fair compensation for an All-Star such as Paul George, so if Danny Ainge really wants him, the Pacers should be open to that discussion. \n[Featured Image by Michael Conroy/AP Images]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:53:48.562+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
