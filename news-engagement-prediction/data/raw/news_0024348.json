In the RS profile of Migos, which was published Wednesday, the trio seemed to suggest that Makonnen's coming out should not be supported. \n\"They supported him?\" Quavo asks, raising an eyebrow. \"That's because the world is fucked up,\" says Offset. \"This world is not right,\" Takeoff says. \nIn the new statement, the trio clarify these remarks, writing \"We feel the world is fucked up that people feel like they have to hide and we're asked to comment on someone's sexuality.\" \nIn the profile, group member Quavo also suggested that Makonnen's sexuality \"undermines his credibility.\" \n\"We ain't saying it's nothing wrong with the gays,\" says Quavo. But he suggests that Makonnen's sexuality undermines his credibility, given the fact that \"he first came out talking about trapping and selling Molly, doing all that.\" \nHe frowns. \"That's wack, bro.\" \nWhile this portion of the interview is not explicitly addressed, the statement closes with a general apology. \"We have no problem with anyone's sexual preference. We love all people, gay or straight and we apologize if we offended anyone.\" \nRead the statement in full below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T05:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:06:42.137+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
