What brings relief for one person may not work for another. There are a variety of natural treatments available, but tinnitus sufferers should seek a physician's care before pursuing a course of treatment. Alternative Therapy \nAcupuncture, cranio-sacral therapy, magnet therapy , hyperbaric oxygen, and hypnosis are among the alternative treatments that holistic healers have employed to manage the discomfort and pain associated with tinnitus. Although some tinnitus sufferers have found these treatments helpful, research on the effectiveness of these treatments has been inconclusive. Aromatherapy \nIn cases where problems with blood circulation are symptomatic of tinnitus, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Natural Remedies recommends four essential oils : rosemary, cypress, lemon, and rose. Oils can be administered with a head massage, a vaporizer, or an aromatherapy diffuser. Counseling \nLiving with tinnitus can be an emotionally taxing experience. Talking with a counselor or joining a support group can offer emotional support. Herbs \nGinkgo Biloba , Black Cohosh, Hawthorn, MelatoninAccording to a study done by the Department of Food Science at the University of Massachusetts, ginkgo leaf extract may be effective for the treatment of tinnitus. Ginkgo extract is widely prescribed by holistic healers as a treatment for a range of health issues including memory and concentration problems, confusion, depression, anxiety, dizziness, tinnitus and headache. The Encyclopedia of Medicinal Plants categorizes tinnitus as a nerve condition that can benefit from black cohosh. Additionally, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Natural Remedies suggests black cohosh as an herbal remedy for blood congestion or pressure in the head. It also suggests hawthorn as a remedy for tinnitus due to it being a tonic for the circulatory system.To address tinnitus related sleep disturbances, melatonin combined with Sulodexide is a viable treatment option for patients suffering from central or sensorineural tinnitus, according to study conducted by the University of Chieti-Pescara on managing tinnitus. Homeopathy \nHomeopathic remedies suggested as natural treatments for tinnitus by homeopathic practitioners include Calcarea carbonica, Carbo vegetabilis, Cinchona officinalis (China), Chininum sulphuricum, Cimicifuga, Coffea cruda, Graphites, Kali carbonicum, Lycopodium, Natrum salicylicum, and Salicylicum acidum. However, medical research has not shown the effectiveness of homeopathy for tinnitus relief. Relaxation Therapies \nMassage therapy, Meditation, Yoga, and BiofeedbackStress relief and relaxation therapies are helpful in easing the discomfort and pain of tinnitus. Massage applied to the head, neck and chest is suggested. Sound Therapy \nWhite noise machines. Sound tapes (rainfalls, ocean waves, humming, chants, wind sounds, etc.).Sound therapy is used as a way to mask or distract from the annoying noises associated with tinnitus. Tinnitus Retraining Therapy (TRT) \nTinnitus Retraining Therapy is a counseling technique used to teach tinnitus sufferers how to refocus their attentions away from the ill effects of tinnitus. Results from clinical study overseen by the Department of Veteran Affairs indicated that TRT was significantly more effective in comparison to traditional counseling or non-treatment. TMS Healing \nTinnitus is among the many conditions identified as possibly manifested by TMS (Tension Myositis Syndrome), a psychosomatic disorder. Steven Ray Ozanich, author of The Great Pain Deception says his own ear ringing was silenced with TMS healing .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:28:24.831+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
