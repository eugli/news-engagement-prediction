Of the 49 seats alloted to female candidates, three are from the unreserved category while the rest are reserved for women. \n\nAmong the prominent ones to find their names in the list is Ankush Narang, Delhi youth wing president of AAP. He will contest from West Patel Nagar. \n\nThe three MCDs with 272 wards are expected to go to polls in April. \n\nAAP Delhi Unit Convenor Dilip Pandey said work for selecting candidates for the remaining seats is on. \n\n\"The BJP and the Congress have indulged in corruption in civic bodies for the last 20 years. It is the time for the broom (the AAP symbol) to wipe out corruption from the MCDs,\" Pandey said. \n\nSwaraj India, the political outfit headed by Yogendra Yadav, also announced second list of 30 candidates today. \n\nEarly this week, it had announced candidates for 25 seats. \n\nAAP has received over 10,000 applications from aspirants eying the 272 seats. Of these, 3,522 are from North MCD, 3,673 from South and 2,902 from East MCD. \n\nThe party plans to take on BJP and Congress by focusing on alleged financial irregularities in the civic bodies. \n\nDelhi is governed by multiple agencies and civic bodies are a crucial cog in the wheel of day-to-day governance. \n\nWith the city government under its control, AAP now intends to wrest power from BJP which has been managing the civic bodies. Over the past few months, AAP has been raising issues related to alleged corruption in the MCDs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T04:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T18:43:16.641+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
