We can also put on a photo of the loved one in happier times - the coffin design can have a photograph of the person celebrating a birthday or on holiday. \n\"It is a difficult time for families and these things can help a bit.\" Image copyright Eco coffins direct Image caption The Giant's Causeway is pictured on one of these coffins \nIan Milne is a Northern Ireland representative of the National Association of Funeral Directors and has been involved in the business for over three decades. \nHe says bespoke coffins are another example of the transformation of funeral practices in the region during the past five years. \n\"I would say that people feel easier about expressing their wishes at the time of death now,\" he said. \n\"In society now, we have a greater density of faiths and non-faiths. \n\"I have carried out funerals for people who would describe themselves as high priestesses and wizards. \n\"There are a lot more humanist funerals now. The number of cremations has also increased dramatically. There is a lot of change, the number of religious-based funerals seems to be decreasing. \n\"The time that people stay in a funeral home has increased. Some people have booked their holiday and they simply cannot cancel it - the longest we have kept any body here is six weeks.\" Image copyright Milne Funeral Services Image caption Ian Milne has been in the funeral industry for more than 30 years and has witnessed a number of changes in recent years \nMr Milne said that population changes in Northern Ireland meant he had become educated in the funeral cultures of various nationalities. \n\"I would do a lot of Eastern European funerals now,\" he said. \n\"I have also been involved in a number of Vietnamese funerals which are lovely. \n\"They can burn money including (replica) high-value notes, the idea is that the money goes to the higher place where the person who died is supposed to be.\" 'Feathered friends' \nMr Milne also acknowledged that the internet was driving development in the industry and that the \"personalisation of the funeral is in full swing\". \n\"A lot of people are writing down what they want ahead of their funeral,\" he added. \n\"I have wishes for people who want to wear ostrich feathers in their coffin. \n\"There are some people who want to be buried with their pets, but because it is consecrated ground that cannot happen.

It was a lovely touch. \n\"The people who were friends of the young woman wanted that.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T16:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T12:37:49.141+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
