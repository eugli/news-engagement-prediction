President Obama's appointees were being blocked left and right by brilliant strategist and \"Master Obstructionist\" Mitch McConnell, then Republican Minority Leader of The Senate and appointments and empty seats were backing up. \nHad Democrats not \"nuked\" the filibuster for Cabinet Secretaries in 2013, Democrats would have been able to successfully block Betsy DeVos, Rex Tillerson and everyone else forcing Donald Trump to go back to the drawing board and come up appointees that would have been acceptable to at least 8 Senate Democrats, in order to avoid a filibuster. \nInstead, he's going to get everything and everyone he wants, regardless of their level of competence and America is, thus, changed for the next 4 years. \nSomething for Republicans to remember as they ponder pulling their own \"Nuclear Option\" to kill the Senate filibuster for Supreme Court nominees, a move that was considered too anti-democratic, too extreme and too dangerous even for the zealous \"Class of 2013\" Senate Democrats. \nHad these Democrats known that the next President would be a reality tv star determined to choose the least appropriate and least qualified Cabinet in the history of the country, perhaps they would have given pause. \nBut in the \"what goes around, comes around\" scheme of things, I wonder what current Senate Republicans will be thinking as they sit helplessly by watching our next President, Socialist President Bernie Sanders, or someone perhaps even more \"radical\", replace Clarence Thomas, Anthony Kennedy and Chief Justice John Roberts with the most radical liberal Justices anyone can find. \nLive by \"nuking the filibuster\", die by \"nuking the filibuster\"!
