He then leads the election, represents the vision and commitments of his party; and he is held accountable to implement policies according to his election promises when he comes into office. \nTherefore, it is the desire of the voters to know, prior to the 14th general election (GE14), who will be leading the country should the opposition front wins, for he would determine the fate of the rakyat in the near future. \nWho takes the lead in GE14? Difference in opinions cloud the opposition front regarding the leader in GE14 and the PM candidate, however the views of the Pakatan Harapan component parties remains unanimous. \nBoth DAP and Amanah declared their opinion openly in strong support of Anwar Ibrahim as the PM candidate during the 2016 Pakatan Harapan Convention. Such meticulous decisions are made after much consideration of the sentiments of their supporters. \nSentiment of the majority \nNineteen years ago, in 1998, Anwar founded the Reform Movement, and his leadership remains strong till this very day. The Reform Movement has gained tremendous momentum despite his unjust imprisonments. \nUnder the leadership of Anwar; in the 2008 GE the opposition won five state governments - never before seen in Malaysian elections; and in the 2013 GE, the opposition won 52 percent of the popular votes - this country could have been ours. \nTherefore to win GE14, the opposition front must continue to build on the bulk of voters who want to see reform in the country. \nAnwar is the icon of the Reform Movement. He is the voice behind ideals, the bold face of a nation wanting change, and the name that goes before all institutional and governmental reforms. The bars of prison do not change this iconic impression of our leader. \nThe Reform Movement is mature and ready for a breakthrough and there is no real need for Anwar to be physically present on the GE14. It is paramount, however, that we know he continues to command, inspire, and most importantly support the opposition campaign on all fronts of the election to achieve victory. \nPrecedence of interim PM \nAs GE14 is drawing near, a practical question arises - with Anwar still in prison, who will be the PM in the event the opposition wins? \nIt is not abnormal that the ruling government would put the dominant opposition leader in a politically unfavourable circumstance. However, when the opposition comes into power, the appointment of an interim PM may be an adept situational remedy, as shown in the following examples: \nFor instance, when AKP, founded by Recep Tayyip Erdogan, won a landslide victory in the 2002 Turkey election, Erdogan could not be the PM because he was banned from political office by the previous regime. To solve the problem, the co-founder of AKP, Abdullah Gul, was appointed as an interim PM until the new government annulled Erdoganâ€™s ban. Subsequently, Erdogan stood and won in a by-election, and took over the premiership a year later. \nIn Myanmar, Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the National League for Democracy( NLD) who won in the 2015 GE, was forbidden by the Myanmar constitution to become the president because her children are foreign nationals. To solve the problem, her confidante Htin Kyaw was made the president while Aung remains the de facto leader with an official title of state counsellor. \nShe has pledged to amend the undemocratic constitution which was drafted by the military junta. It is expected that she would assume the post of the president once the constitution is amended and the ban on her lifted. \nWan Azizah - the assurance factor \nIn Malaysia, Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, the opposition leader who has been leading the Reform Movement and Pakatan Harapan in the absence of Anwar, provides a sensible and practical solution in becoming the interim PM. With her holding the fort, the voters can rest assure that the new government will not deviate from its reform agenda. \nThere are indeed many capable leaders in the opposition front who appears to qualify as the PM candidate. However, one must bear in mind that the bulk of the opposition supporters who voted for reform as happened in GE13 rallied behind the iconic impression of Anwar. Will the opposition front remain appealing to the voters if the opposition puts up a PM candidate of another name apart from Anwar, or the idea that Wan Azizah is not to be the interim PM? \nFor the rest of this story and more, subscribe for only RM150 a year.
