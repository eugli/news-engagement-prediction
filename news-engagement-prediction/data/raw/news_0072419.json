CATHARINES, Ont. — Remember that scene in Seabiscuit, when the radio man loses his mind upon learning the star racehorse’s injured jockey would be replaced by the most decorated rider available? \n“The Iceman cometh! What a pinch hitter! Why, it’s like getting Babe Ruth off the bench. Nerves of steel, ice water in his veins…” \nThat came to mind Tuesday at the Scotties Tournament of Hearts, when Alberta skip Shannon Kleibrink admitted — in a bittersweet moment here — that she might not curl again at these women’s nationals because of an injured back. \nThat’s the bitter part. The sweet part is that Kleibrink four weeks ago enlisted the services of 2012 Scotties champion Heather Nedohin as alternate. More specifically, as emergency fill-in skip when required. \nIn the last week of January, Nedohin indeed subbed in as skip occasionally to help Kleibrink, third Lisa Eyamie, second Sarah Wilkes and lead Alison Thiessen win the provincials for the Okotoks Curling Club (south of Calgary). \nAnd in three games as skip here at the Meridian Centre, Nedohin has led Alberta to a pair of crucial victories. \nIn Draw 8 Tuesday morning, things looked bleak for Nedohin and Alberta, trailing winless Saskatchewan 6-3 through six ends and 7-6 entering the 10th without the hammer. But Nedohin stole one to force an extra end, whereupon she stole three more to win it. She shot an on-fire 91% in the game. \nIn Tuesday afternoon’s Draw 9, Alberta jumped out to a 3-1 lead against undefeated Michelle Englot of Manitoba, but gave up three in the fifth to lose the lead for good in a 9-5 defeat. \nAlberta has a 3-3 record but remains very much in playoff contention, with three struggling teams up next (0-6 British Columbia, 1-4 Nova Scotia and 2-4 PEI), before concluding round-robin play against 3-3 Northwest Territories and 4-1 Team Canada. \nNedohin had stepped back from competitive curling in 2015 to become business manager of the Sherwood Park Curling Club, just east of Edmonton. \n“I’m going to get emotional,” she said Tuesday morning. “It feels really good to be back. I love playing on this ice, when you can make shots … and try to bring out the best in the players. \n“And I have to be honest: I never thought I’d be back. So, for me, I mean it’s harsh that Shannon’s back is not feeling well. But at the same (time), it’s like something was presented to me and I’m just going to roll with it.” \nNedohin first competed in the Scotties in the late 1990s. As a third for Cathy Borst, she was a Scotties champion and world bronze medallist in 1998, and Scotties runner-up in 1999. \nAs Scotties champion with her own rink in 2012, the 41-year-old won bronze at the worlds. \nNow, she’s back. \n“I’m still buzzing, I have to be honest,” Nedohin said minutes after the rally against Saskatchewan. “(At the) opening ceremonies here, seeing so many familiar faces, it really hit me that that’s when I missed it. \n“I do not miss the grind of (playing) every weekend, and traveling to small communities and blah, blah, blah. I do miss this.” Related ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:03:32.195+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
