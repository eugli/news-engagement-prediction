He will say and do outrageous, possibly unconstitutional things, and representatives will stomp their feet, and judges will exercise those checks and balances. It’s been disappointing to some voters that Democrats aren’t stomping quite as loud as anticipated; Senator Elizabeth Warren’s choice to vote in favor Dr. Ben Carson for secretary of housing and urban development was particularly upsetting to those who view her as a type of political superhero. The Democrats set out to inspire and satisfy their base last night with an all-night debate on the Senate floor that’s expected to last until Tuesday afternoon’s vote to confirm Betsy DeVos as secretary of education. Their aim is to convince just one more Republican senator to switch his or her vote; just one more opposing vote is all that’s needed for her nomination to fail. “Thank you all for your support. I’ll be up all night working to get ‘just one more’ Republican to vote against Betsty Devos,” tweeted Senator Senator Bob Casey (D-Pennsylvania), posting a photo of himself speaking to the crowds assembled outside the Capitol. Broadcast live on C-SPAN, representatives filled by discussing DeVos’s experience (or lack thereof) and telling stories about their own education. Several senators read from the tens of thousands of letters they’ve received from constituents in the past few weeks begging them to vote against her appointment. (This is despite KellyAnne Conway’s stated claim last night that those opposing DeVos “aren't real people.”) While many of President Trump’s Cabinet appointments are controversial, DeVos seems particularly loathsome to voters. “Opposition to Betsy DeVos has caught fire across the country because this is about kids, schools, and communities,” tweeted Senator Patty Murray (D-Washington). DeVos’s Senate hearing revealed how little she understood basic theories or styles of education, and how little experience she has with the public school system. (She and her family have never attended one.) In a previous round of hearings, Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) asked DeVos directly: “Do you think that if you were not a multibillionaire, if your family had not made hundreds of millions of dollars in contributions, that you would be sitting here today?” The #HoldTheFloor marathon is a rousing bit of political theater, but the unfortunate truth is that it might not amount to much. While two Republican senators have vowed to vote against DeVos (Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska), the others are unlikely to budge. One Philadelphia teacher took matters into her own hands, creating a GoFundMe to (semi-seriously) buy Senator Pat Toomey’s vote: DeVos has reportedly donated $55,800 to Toomey’s campaigns, so the goal of $60,000 was intended to offset that favor. It raised nearly $71,000 in five days. The answer will likely come today. If no more Republicans are swayed by the debate, then Vice President Mike Pence will cast the tie-breaking vote. It would be a historic occasion, as a VP has never broken a tie for something as high level as a Cabinet appointment.
