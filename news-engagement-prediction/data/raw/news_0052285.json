PUBLISHED: 18:02, Wed, Feb 22, 2017 | UPDATED: 18:14, Wed, Feb 22, 2017 GETTY Jean-Claude Juncker has been told the EU's 'credibility' is on the line over the Brexit demand \nThe European Commission’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier is reported to be ready to hit Theresa May with a divorce payment of between €50 billion-€60 billion for “outstanding liabilities” when Brexit talks begin later this year. \nMr Juncker, president of the European Commission, this week appeared to confirm such a bill by warning Britain of the “hefty” cost for leaving the EU. \nHe insisted the UK could not expect a \"cut-price or zero-cost\" Brexit. \nBut a Tory MP has warned Mr Juncker the EU’s “credibility” now relies on Brussels officials being able to back up such a demand by setting out “in detail” their calculations for an exit fee. Related articles Ex-EU boss sends Sturgeon warning over Scottish independence \nSouth Thanet MP Craig MacKinlay, vice-chair of the Brexit-backing European Research Group of Conservatives, said: “With Jean-Claude Juncker and Michael Barnier seemingly working to the same speculative figure of £50billion as the divorce bill payable by the UK on Brexit, this must be seen as either unhelpful or provocative. \n“Now that a seemingly settled figure hangs in the air, I challenge them to set out in detail a full breakdown of their calculations and any claimed legal basis for each line of liability. \n”The credibility of the European Commission in any forthcoming negotiations around the withdrawal of the UK from the EU relies on their ability to justify claims they have made. \n“It is now important for the European Commission to come clean on this issue.” Juncker's many signs of affection Wed, January 18, 2017 Jean-Claude Juncker is a Luxembourgish politician.
