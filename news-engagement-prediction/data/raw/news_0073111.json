DeMarcus revealed an amazing nickname for his pairing with Anthony Davis. \nGet ready for a little fire and ice when the Pelicans run their shiny new All-Star filled frontcourt, via Marc Spears of ESPN: \nBoogie and The Brow will probably have another nickname among opposing coaches — probably something like \"A Nightmare to Gameplan For\" — but this works. \nCousins is clearly the fire in this equation, considering his infamous temper on the court and fact that he's racked up 17 technical fouls through the '16-17 season. Davis has drained his fair share of game-winning shots, proving he's cool as ice when the pressure is turned up. \nThe duo should be one of the most formidable one-two punches the NBA has seen, pairing arguably two top-five big men together. Let's hope that Cousins' competitive fire doesn't melt his cold-as-ice partner. \nThis gimmick has also been done, as some astute folks on social media were sure to point out. Blades of Glory references? Always a worthwhile addition: \nWe can only hope that Cousins and Davis can be as in sync. \nDo you have a better nickname for the power duo? Drop it in the comments!
