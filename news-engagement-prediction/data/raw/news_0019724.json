Al Franken (D-MN), in which the lawmaker called Trump mentally ill, Maher began the panel discussion and Morgan immediately went after the comedian. \nFollowing a rant about how everyone is over the top with their criticisms and characterizations of Trump, especially when it comes to calling him the “new Hitler,” Morgan then made a request from everybody against Trump. \n“I just think it is time for everybody to take a massive gigantic chill pill,” the former CNN host exclaimed. \nOver the next few minutes, Morgan would offer defenses of Trump while the rest of the panel and Maher would shoot them down. \nMorgan insisted that they needed to save the outrage for when Trump actually goes over the edge. Meanwhile, Maher kept noting that this “isn’t normal.” \nWatch the entire exchange above, via HBO. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T11:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T09:02:38.299+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
