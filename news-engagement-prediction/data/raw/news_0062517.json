Dershowitz says one of his chief points of opposition is Ellison’s “long history of sordid association with anti-Semitism.” \nDuring this week’s DNC leadership debate on CNN, Ellison––who condemned President Trump for not doing enough to address anti-Semitism––dismissed these charges against him as “smears.” \nDershowitz slams Ellison for his past associations with Louis Farrakhan and writes, “Ellison himself has made anti-Semitic statements. A prominent lawyer, with significant credibility, told me that while he was a law student, Ellison approached her and said he could not respect her, because she was a Jew and because she was a woman who should not be at a law school.” \nHe doesn’t believe Ellison’s “apology tour” to be sincere, saying that “I do not trust him. I do not believe him. And neither should centrist liberal supporters of Israel and opponents of anti-Semitism.” \nMany on the left have argued for Ellison as a much better alternative to an establishment figure like Perez, while Dershowitz said today he thinks “the self-destructive election of Keith Ellison will be hard to undo for many years.” \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T08:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:09:57.737+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
