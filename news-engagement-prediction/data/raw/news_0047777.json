Similar threats have been made to Jewish schools in recent weeks, and last Thursday vandals in suburban St. Louis knocked over dozens of headstones in a Jewish cemetery.\n“America is a nation built on the principle of religious tolerance. We must protect our house of worship & religious centers. #JCC,” Trump’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, tweeted Monday.\nShe converted to Judaism before marrying husband Jared Kushner, who is Orthodox.\nOn Tuesday, Hillary Clinton, Trump’s Democratic rival in the 2016 White House race, had called on Trump and others to “speak out” on attacks.\n“JCC threats, cemetery desecration & online attacks are so troubling & they need to be stopped. Everyone must speak out, starting w/ @POTUS ,” Clinton tweeted about an hour before Trump’s remarks.\nJCC threats, cemetery desecration & online attacks are so troubling & they need to be stopped.
