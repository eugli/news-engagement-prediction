After the Grammys ended, DJ Khaled dropped what has to be the biggest song released this year thus far, \" Shining (Feat. Beyonce & Jay Z) .\" Aside from the obvious magnitude of a track like this, Twitter blew up with accusations that Hov was dissing none other than Drake on the track. Check out the accusatory tweet below. — Irv (@thisisIRV) February 13, 2017 \nSome on Twitter saw this as just one jab in a series of shots, spanning \"Summer Sixteen,\" \"I Got The Keys,\" and most recently, \"Sneakin.\" Jay Z didn't shout out 21 Savage . That was him taking a subliminal shot back at Drake. Cause he dissed Jay on sneakin.
