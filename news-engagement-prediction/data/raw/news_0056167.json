Aric Chokey Privacy Policy \nBack home in his Boynton Beach condo, Gene Huber is reminiscing about what he considers a dream come true: Being called onto a stage in front of thousands to meet the president. \nDonald Trump singled him out and got him to excitedly run up to the stage during a weekend rally at Orlando Melbourne International Airport. \n“It’s still a dream come true,” Huber said Tuesday. “It’s almost like it’s not even real.” \nSince his moment of fame, the 47-year-old married father of two has bounced between interviews with news outlets and said he hopes to use it as a way to advocate for Trump. \nHuber, who said he works from home as a car salesman for a company he co-owns, said he got on board with Trump right after he heard the candidate announce his run. \nDonald Trump has owned Mar-a-Lago, the Palm Beach estate built by cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post, since the 1980s. Trump turned it into a private club and is using it as his Weekend White House. \nHe and his wife were both drawn to Trump’s message of being a political outsider, saying they never felt like they trusted politicians. \nHuber became so enthusiastic about Trump that he bought a life-size cardboard cutout of him. Every morning, Huber gets out of bed and starts his day by saluting the cutout of Trump, he said. \n“I say, ‘Good morning Mr. President. I pray for your safety and I want to thank you for your service and have a great day today,’” Huber said. \nFor the Melbourne rally, Huber set up camp nearly 12 hours ahead of the 3 p.m. event to beat out the estimated 9,000 who attended, he said. \n“I sat all by myself on the sidewalk for about an hour and a half,” Huber said. “That was my goal and my mission.” \nHuber managed to be the first in line. During the rally, Trump told the crowd that he had seen Huber on TV because news outlets interviewed him for being at the head of the line. \n“That’s my guy right there,” Trump told the crowd right before calling up Huber. Once Huber was on stage, they hugged. \nHuber’s daughter, Alyssa, 17, has been excited about seeing her father’s name in news headlines, Huber’s wife, Cathy, recalled Tuesday. \nGene Jr., 5, hasn’t really grasped what is going on, she said. \nGene Huber has watched just about every speech Trump has made and has tried to make every local rally since the beginning of his run, his wife said.
