Here are select vocalists who we think can take the celebrated show to a different level altogether. \nRahim Shah Rahim Shah. PHOTO: PUBLICITY \nThe man behind the melancholic Ghum has not made an appearance on Coke Studio yet. The Jhoola hit-maker is one of those rare artistes who have successfully transitioned from regional to mainstream music. \nWith his exceptional understanding of what strikes a chord with the public, Shah can perform miracles for the show. His last mainstream stint as a musician was Gul Bashri that featured on Moor’s soundtrack. If you haven’t heard it yet, you’re definitely missing out. \nHadiqa Kiani Hadiqa Kiani. PHOTO: PUBLICITY \nWhen one talks of those who can yodel as comfortably as they can sing a qawwali or a manqabat , not many Pakistani singers come to mind. From Manne Di Mauj to Wo Kaun Hai , Boohe Bariyan to Dupatta and Inteha-e-Shauq to Rung , she has delivered more hits than most. \nHadiqa recently came out with a Pashto and Urdu manqabat, Mushkil Aasaana, written by her late father Mehmud Akhtar Kiani and Rafiq Shinwari. In the day and age of instrumental noise, keeping things simple yet absorbing is a real challenge. We believe Hadiqa still has the Midas touch needed to make magic the second time over. \nSomeWhatSuper Somewhatsuper PHOTO: PUBLICITY \nDynamic duo Feroz and Talha have been redefining the musical landscape of Pakistan by fusing electronic music with desi tunes. No, they are not making ‘fusion’ music, the cliché that has taken over the industry at large with trained classical vocalists belting out one raag after another as a rock band plays in the background. \nThese guys know music well enough to make the debut song of Abid Brohi look like a finished work of an accomplished rapper. Having said that, SomeWhatSuper’s own work is equally amazing. Bandook , their claim to fame is just one of the gems available online. The duo’s inclusion in Coke Studio could also open doors for Pakistan’s fledgling Inde music scene. \nKhumariyaan PHOTO: PUBLICITY \nIn a country like ours, ingenuity coupled with spectacle is imperative for attention. Popular Pakistani music has walked the tightrope for years. Peshawar-based quartet Khumariyaan has been striving to transform just that. \nThe instrumental band has breathed (new) life into ethnic music with their work in addition to uplifting people the world over with their powerful performances. With Sparlay Rawail on lead guitars, Aamer Shafiq on rhythm guitars, Farhan Bogra on Rabab and Shiraz Khan on percussion this band has all it takes to transform the studio into a concert hall. Is Coke Studio listening? \nShehzad Roy Shehzad Roy. PHOTO: PUBLICITY \nFrom Dholna to Saali , Shehzad Roy has made a mark whenever he’s released a single. Moreover, Roy’s evolution from lost romeo to satirist has made him a force to be reckoned with in Pakistan’s music industry. \nPeople may have reservations about his talent but he has never claimed to hail from the Patiala Gharana, composing as he always does melodies suited to his raw vocal texture and limited range. The singer could invigorate the show with his satire and ingenuity. \nUrwa Hocane Urwa Hocane. PHOTO: PUBLICITY \nShe clearly doesn’t deserve a show as prestigious as Coke Studio but keeping its history in mind, don’t be too surprised if Urwa Hocane is presented as a wild card entry. From Ayesha Omar to Komal Rizvi, Coke Studio boasts an ‘enviable record’ of providing the ‘gifted’ with a platform. \nWho knows what’s in store for us next. She’s already released a ‘single’ and ‘performed’ alongside the equally accomplished Farhan in addition to being a recognised face. Foolproof recipe we say. \nHave something to add in the story?
