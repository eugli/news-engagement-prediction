Cheryl Evans/azcentral.com \nOnce, Jim Mende went on a field trip to the Arizona state Capitol with the sixth-graders from All Saints’ Episcopal Day School and they ran through Wesley Bolin Plaza, laughing. Sarah Klemmer still remembers that day.\nAnother time, when Jim received a huge box of jelly beans in 50 different flavors on his birthday, he dared the sixth-graders to put one of each flavor in their mouths at the same time. John Witt can tell that story.\nThat was the same day Alexa Howard, who’s 11, wrote “Jim was here!” in marker on the whiteboard in classroom 6C. The kids have never erased it.\nJim also told the best stories. About living through the Great Depression. About serving in World War II.\nSure, at 92, he was a little old for the sixth grade. But 11-year-old Taylor Serrano liked to think he was a kid in an older person’s body.\nSomething special about Jim It started with a letter.\nAs part of their studies of World War II last year, Carla Cotton’s sixth-graders wrote letters to veterans traveling on an Honor Flight Network trip. The nonprofit group takes veterans on three-day, all-expense-paid trips to Washington, D.C., to see the memorials that mark their time in the service.\nMore from Karina Bland The WW II vet and the sixth-graders who made him their friend Marine vet quits job over 'Semper Fi' tattoo, finds his truer calling at VA hospital A lie, some luck and her mother's hands saved her.

On the flight back home, there is a surprise “mail call,” just like in the military. Each veteran is given a packet filled with letters from friends, family and volunteers.\nMs. Cotton put up the list of 26 veterans and told her students to pick someone. On the list were each veteran's name, branch of service and their job.\nNo one from Ms. Cotton’s class picked James Everett Mende, who served in the U.S. Army as a warehouse manager. Maybe his job didn’t sound as exciting compared to infantryman or naval aviator.\nBut Ms. Cotton didn’t want him to go without mail, so she wrote to Mende. (Later a girl in another class, Kate Erblich, would also write to Jim.)\nWhen the veterans returned from their trip on March 18, 2016, landing at Sky Harbor International Airport, about 40 All Saints’ students were there to cheer them with posters that said, “Welcome home!” and “Thank you!” The school’s band played a medley of military anthems they had learned just for the occasion.\nJim wrote back to Ms. Cotton and Kate, thanking them for their letters.\nMs. Cotton wrote to Jim again, though she’s not sure why. “There was something super special about him,” she said.\nThe nonagenarian veteran and the 48-year-old teacher became pen pals, writing back and forth from the school in central Phoenix to the home Jim shared with his son and daughter-in-law in Sun City West.\nCarla had written letters back and forth with her grandmother for as long as she could remember. Her grandmother had loved history, and when Carla was a little girl, she had let her look at a book she had with photographs from Life magazine. Carla thinks that may be why she teaches history.\nTwo years ago, her grandmother passed away. “Writing to Jim just kind of filled this place for me that was missing since my grandmother died,” she said.\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Jim Mende and the students at All Saints’ Episcopal Day School   Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

He made his own envelopes out of folded copy paper, printed with pictures and cartoons. He made return address labels for Ms. Cotton with cotton balls printed on them.\nMs. Cotton wrote some of her letters on the computer and hand wrote others. She told Jim what her class was studying and about her students.\nWhen she told him about an annual naturalization ceremony in the school’s gymnasium, he wrote back that he’d never witnessed one. She invited him to attend.\nSo in May 2016, Jim drove himself from Sun City West to the school for his first visit.\nJim was tall, with white hair and glasses, and he wore a black War World II veterans cap, which he took off when he went inside.\nAfter the ceremony, he walked with Ms. Cotton to 6C and talked to three classes, one after the other, about his experience in World War II.\nJim was inducted into the U.S. Army in 1943 and served until 1946, a technical sergeant with the 586th Signal Depot Company in New Guinea, the Philippines, Japan and the Pacific Theater.\nHe seemed to know how to talk to the students, even with the decades that separated them. “It was clear on that day that Jim loved the kids, and they loved him,” Ms. Cotton said.\nWhen Jim was a boy, a survivor of the Civil War had spoken at his school. He remembered thinking, “That guy is so old.” He told Ms. Cotton, “Now I’m that old guy!”\nShe invited Jim to stay for lunch.\nAZCENTRAL\nArizona World War II vets reminisce, reflect in trip to Washington\nA flag and the lessons it taught School let out for the summer, but Carla and Jim continue to write. In one letter, he told her that on the Honor Flight he had purchased an American flag that had flown over Fort McHenry, the base that had inspired Francis Scott Key to write \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\"\n“I want you to have it in your classroom,” he wrote.\nShe and her partner, Cathy Cohn, who teaches math at All Saints’, drove to Sun City West to have lunch with Jim. It was the first time Jim had met Cathy.\n“When you find the love of your life,” Jim told Carla, “that’s the person you should be with.”\nJim had been married twice.\nHe gave Carla the flag, carefully folded into a triangle in a wooden box with a display window. They decided that one student each week would take the flag home for the weekend and write about what it means to live in America.\nEach essay would be put in a flag journal. Ms. Cotton would mail a copy to Jim.\nAll Saints' Episcopal Day School sixth-grader Layton Duncan, 12, celebrates the life of Jim Mende, World War II vet.

(Photo: Cheryl Evans/The Republic) \nCarla and Jim continued to write. She told him about the sixth-graders' annual overnight trip to the Grand Canyon. He wrote back about how much he loved to hike. She did, too.\nSo in October, Carla and Cathy invited Jim on a three-day trip to the Grand Canyon, where they hiked to Desert Watchtower and sipped a cocktail of Jim’s making: 2 shots of Maker's Mark, a small-batch bourbon whisky, and ½ shot of Grand Marnier orange liqueur, poured over crushed ice, topped with ginger beer and garnished with a slice of orange.\nThey watched the presidential debate on television and talked about the world’s problems. They clinked glasses and toasted America.\nJim and his second wife, Marge, had often taken long road trips; he had marked the highways they covered on a map in his bedroom.\n“I think part of it was just the adventure and getting out and the travel and seeing what the kids had seen,” Carla said. “It was maybe his last great adventure, just a chance to get out.\"\nThe swabbies, the cute-tips and Jim Jim began to return to school regularly. He took an interest in Ms. Cotton’s advisory group, the seven girls and three boys she meets with at the start of every day. They had been nicknamed the “Cotton Swabs,” but Jim thought of something else: For the boys, “Cotton Swabbies,” or “swabbies” for short, like the swabbies on the deck of naval ships. The girls became the “cute-tips.”\nWhenever Jim came to school, the kids would call out, “The swabbies, the cute-tips and Jim!”\nHe visited school on Service Day in October, when the new crop of sixth-graders wrote letters to Korean War veterans taking the next Honor Flight. He helped make American flag pins with tiny red, white and blue beads. They would sell them later and earn $2,000 toward future flights.\nThat’s when Jim went on the field trip to the state Capitol, assigned to a group with Ms. Cotton and three girls, and they chased from one spot to the next on a scavenger hunt.\nJim liked to find quotes, print them on strips of paper and hand them out. On Veterans Day, the strips of paper said: “Only two defining forces have ever offered to die for you; Jesus Christ and the American G.I. One died for your soul; the other for your freedom.”\nJust before Thanksgiving break, Alexa invited Jim to Special Persons Day, when kids invite relatives to attend a class with them and then a special performance. Jim sat with Alexa’s mother.\n“Jim got excited about everything. He was just so positive. I knew he would enjoy it,” Alexa said.\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn All Saints' Episcopal Day School honors WWII vet   Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

The girls all received stuffed animals. When Jim said his brother had a teddy bear when they were growing up but he never did, Alexa got him one.\n“Yours truly was overwhelmed with an outpouring from the students,” Jim wrote in a letter dated Dec. 31, 2016, to Leo Dressel, All Saints’ head of school. “From cookies and candy to gift cards and now, my own teddy bear. I only hope that over time, I will be able to justify and deserve it.

How many have you used to say ‘thank you’?”\nFor Jim’s birthday on Jan. 5, Ms. Cotton bought doughnuts. Jim waited until every student had one before he took one for himself.\nHe was old school like that. Jim would hold doors open. He told the children to remove their hats indoors, as he did. And when Ms. Cotton took him to lunch later that day, he reached over her to give a $20 bill to the cashier. A gentleman always buys a lady’s lunch, he told her.\nJim came back to school on Jan. 10 to celebrate Martin Luther King Day with a ceremony.\nAfterward, he spoke to two of Ms. Cotton’s classes about what it was like in the Great Depression, which they were studying at the time. He talked about how his father had lost his job, and his mother had to find one. He and his brother took care of the house. It was hard, but they did what they had to do.\nListening to Jim talk, sixth-grader Grace Allen said, “Jim taught me that it is important to always stay hopeful.”\nThe class would soon begin to study World War II.The kids and Jim talked about when he would come back.\nJim Mende visits All Saints’ Episcopal Day School at Christmastime with Alexa Howard and Sophia Castro.   (Photo: Special for The Republic) \nRaising a glass once more On Jan. 11, Jim fell. He was outside with his son and lost his footing. He fell backward and hit his head hard. A CT scan showed his brain was bleeding.\nTwo days later, when Carla and Cathy went to visit him in the hospital, he didn’t seem to know them.\nHe was moved to hospice care and Carla went back. Jim was happy to see her and asked about the kids. She had brought him cards from them.\nJim told Carla how much he enjoyed reading what the kids wrote for the flag journal.\n“It’s very easy to lose hope and to feel like things are really bad until you read what these kids have to say,” he told her. “These kids give me hope for the future.”\nCarla left Jim that day, hopeful that he would get better, though maybe he’d have to give up driving and use a walker to prevent another fall.\nOn Saturday night, Jan. 21, just after 11 p.m., Carla was playing cards with friends and made a round of Jim’s signature cocktails.\nThey raised their glasses to the man who had become so important to so many people. At 11:11 p.m., perhaps as they toasted him, Jim died.\nAll Saints' Episcopal Day School student Taylor Serrano returns some the items that were used in World War II vet Jim Mende's memorial to his son, Rick Mende.   (Photo: Cheryl Evans/The Republic) \n'I'm right here in your heart' That Monday at school, Ms. Cotton cried when she told her students, first the swabbies and the cute-tips, and then one class after another. The kids cried, too. Even the boys. Because Jim had given them strips of paper printed with the words, “Boys don’t cry but men do.”\nIt was what Jim would have called a “three-hanky day.”\nIn the most recent entry in the flag journal, Taylor wrote of missing Jim and then, “Being an American doesn’t just mean being a citizen, it means having a voice and standing up for your beliefs.”\nJim had left some things for Carla. A last letter, in a handmade envelope with her name on it. Inside, there was a copy of a poem, “The Perfect Day.”\nAt the bottom he had written, “Carla, I’ve had two great love affairs in my life, and I didn’t think it was possible to fall in love again until I went back to school. Jim.”\nJim also left a poem for the kids called “If Tomorrow Starts Without Me” by David Romano. She made copies for each student.\nOn Thursday morning, at a memorial for Jim, as they shared memories of the day at the Capitol, of the jelly beans, of the message they never erased in Room 6C, they took turns reading from the poem.\nThe last stanza reads:\n\nSo when tomorrow starts without me don’t think we’re far apart, \nFor every time you think of me, I’m right here in your heart. \nMany of the children were in tears. When the band director, Les Linn, played Taps on the trumpet, they turned to Jim’s flag on a table. Half of the children put their hands over their hearts, the others raised their right hands to their foreheads in a salute. Like Jim always did.\nAlexa picked up Jim's teddy bear off the table and hugged it tight.\nJim was here.\nReach Bland at karina.bland@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8614.
