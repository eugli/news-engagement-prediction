She also repeats her claim from Q&A that Islam was a feminist religion, saying that Muslim women were allowed to own property and refuse their husband's name before colonialists from Britain and Holland adapted the rules. Ms Magied concludes by saying in her view Sharia is about equality, and 'Jacqui [Lambie] has nothing to worry about.' It comes after Senator Lambie also released a video explaining her views on Sharia law in which she branded it as 'an anti-democratic cancer'. Ms Abdel-Magied claims that Islam is a feminist religion and that Sharia promotes 'justice and equality' after Ms Lambie claimed it was 'an anti-democratic cancer' She goes on to single out aspects of Sharia law that she disagrees with, including the death penalty for homosexuals and for 'women who are unfaithful to their husbands.' The independent senator also claims that 'Sharia law denies the right of Jewish people to live in peace in Israel.' She concludes by saying: 'Acceptance of Sharia law is a clear sign of a divided loyalty. 'You are loyal to some religious leader in the Middle East and his ruling, not to the Australian constitution, and our democratic system of government.' Elsewhere today, activists are demanding ABC apologise for allowing Ms Lambie a platform for 'Islamophobia' during her Q&A appearance. Lawyer Azmeena Hussain and writer Sara Saleh, along with a group of 49 Muslim activists and community leaders, started a petition which accuses ABC of handling the debate poorly. The pair have been butting heads ever since a firey exchange on Q&A in which Ms Lambie called for supporters of Sharia law to be deported Muslim activists including writer Sara Saleh (left) and lawyer Asmeena Hussain (right with Malcolm Turnbull) have launched a petition branding Ms Lambie's comments 'racist' They say Ms Lambie used language which was 'racist, Islamophobic and crude' and could inspire people to carry out attacks against Muslims. During the debate Ms Lambie argued that supporters of Sharia law ought to be deported, sparking a furious clash in which Ms Abdel-Magied 'My frustration is that people talk about Islam without knowing anything about it,' Md Abdel-Magied said. 'Islam to me, is the most feminist religion... we got rights well before the Europeans, we don't take our husbands last names because we ain't their property... the fact is, what is culture is separate to what is faith.' But Ms Lambie interjected, shouting out: 'The fact is we have one law in this country and it is the Australian law. It is not Sharia Law. Not in this country, not in my day.' Ms Lambie went on to defend Donald Trump's controversial travel ban, saying that he had 'every right' to do whatever it took to keep 'the majority of America feel safe.' 'Stop playing the victim, we've had enough,' she directed towards Ms Abdel-Magied. 'Your ban got lifted get over it.' WHAT IS SHARIA LAW? Roughly translated Sharia means 'the way', and is a set of rules interpreted from Islamic religious texts governing how Muslims live their lives. It is divided into four sections, the first three of which deal with family matters, prayer, and business dealings, and are not typically considered controversial. It is the fourth section, which deals with criminal acts and punishment, that is most commonly associated with Sharia and causes most debate. It proscribes punishments such as removing thieves' hands, the death penalty for homosexuals, and stoning for adulterers. Sharia criminal law is highly controversial throughout the Muslim world, and is hotly debated among politicians, religious leaders, and scholars. As a result of this debate, most Muslim nations do not enforce the criminal laws, instead relying on aspects of British or French law which were brought into their cultures during the colonial period. Countries such as Tunisia, Morocco, Malaysia and Indonesia do not base their courts on Sharia criminal practices, according to Dr Raihan Ismail, from the Australian National University's Centre for Arab and Islamic Studies. Places such as Iran and Saudi Arabia implement aspects of the legal code, but not all of it. The Taliban enforce a strict version of Sharia in Afghanistan, while ISIS also impose it over the territories they control.
