This is her world. I’m just trying — I’m learning a lot.” \nRebel Wilson, Brittany Snow, Anna Camp, Hailee Steinfeld, Chrissie Fit, and the rest of the Bellas are back in Pitch Perfect 3 — even Elizabeth Banks, who directed the second chapter. The gang has been posting behind-the-scenes photos and video from their cinematic reunion on social media. \n“On a break, Bellas visited our new sea lion mascots” at the Georgia Aquarium, Wilson wrote on Instagram.
