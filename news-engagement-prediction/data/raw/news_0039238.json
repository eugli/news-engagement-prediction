Hillary Clinton has been to the theatre rather a lot Credit: Instagram  44pm \nI t has now been 100 days since Hillary Clinton lost the presidency to Donald Trump. \nSince then, she has taken a well-earned rest, but eagle-eyed fans have seen her out and about. This means we are able to compile a list of a few things she has been up to. \nIs the planning a return to politics? Who knows, but she certainly has been mostly absent from public life since she suffered the devastating loss, which is understandable. \nSo what exactly do you do after you lose the free world to Donald Trump? Here is a summary of her actions since the 9th November. Going hiking Credit: MARGOT GERSTER/FACEBOOK \nH illary Clinton was spotted for the first time since conceding to Donald Trump after the result of the US election . \nMargot Gerster, was hiking with her young daughter Phoebe, in a secluded part of Chappaqua, in northern Westchester County, New York, when she bumped into the former US Secretary of State and her husband, Bill Clinton. \nShe went on a quiet hike because she felt \"heartbroken\" after the election result and wanted to get away from it all. \nShe said she heard a rustling of leaves and then Hillary and Bill Clinton appeared with their dogs. \nMany thought it was quite poetic that the Clintons appeared to be hiding in the tranquil woods after the big defeat. Browsing in a bookshop \nMrs Clinton was spotted at an independent bookshop in Rhode Island. \nShe was shopping for books with her family. \nJ essica Wick, an employee of the Savoy Bookshop in Westerly, posted on Facebook: “I told her I voted for her, that she meant and means a lot. I thanked her, apologising if I was being inappropriate or intrusive. \n“She was gracious and she was warm and she said the bookstore was beautiful.” Thanksgiving shopping \nShortly after this, the politician was seen supporting small businesses during Thanksgiving. \nShe crowded out her small local shop when she made an appearance with her family to pick up some groceries. Another Clinton sighting. This time at the market in Chappaqua. pic.twitter.com/xvAtGWGgCR \nM rs Bosco, who also lives in Chappaqua, told The Telegraph : \"She was very happy, relaxed-looking. She was with Bill, Chelsea, Marc, and her two grandchildren. \n\"The store was crowded with people picking up their Thanksgiving orders. \n\"She was very cordial, talking to people and taking a few photos, but was concentrating on her grandchildren as the store got more crowded. When you go pick up your pie and the entire Clinton family is shopping 2 #shopsmallbusiness #looksgreat#happythanksgiving @HillaryClinton pic.twitter.com/L9zQWLJlB2 — Linda (@lindapmgbosco) November 23, 2016 \n\"They had boxes of food that they had ordered. I live in Chappaqua and have met her a few times. Always exciting. This was the first sighting since the election. \n\"It just seemed so normal for them all to be there shopping for their Thanksgiving meal. Surreal when you think about it though. \n\"Nice to see them actually shopping and shopping locally. They are great that way.\" Showing up at Harry Reid's portrait unveiling \nI n early December, Hillary Clinton made a rare public appearance at Harry Reid‘s portrait unveiling and spoke out against fake news. \nShe said, “It’s now clear that so-called fake news can have real world consequences. This isn’t about politics or partisanship. Lives are at risk.” A solitary breakfast \nTaking some more time for herself, Mrs Clinton was seen having breakfast at an up-scale resort in New York in December.
