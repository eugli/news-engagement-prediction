Obviously in Stoke, Ukip has been at the centre of attention and in Copeland that’s not the case. The overall level of support in the country is well known, and that has implications in any electoral contest and as we know by-elections are notoriously volatile.” \nA month ago Corbyn said he was “very confident” Labour would win both contests, but at a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party on Monday, he described the by-elections as “on a knife-edge” - although he dismissed his party’s poor performance in the polls. \nWhen challenged by former Shadow Chancellor Chris Leslie to explain the Tories’ huge poll lead, Corbyn replied: “Of course I understand what’s going on and the problems we have had in the media.” \nBut he added that “we do a lot better on social media”, one source told HuffPost UK. \nParty sources added after the meeting that Labour was still recovering from the damage caused by the attempted ‘coup’ and “dissension” by Labour MPs themselves. \nLabour’s majority in Stoke Central is 5,179, with Ukip finishing second in the 2015 election. \nThe anti-EU party had been confident of taking the seat from Labour, but party leader Paul Nuttall – who is also the candidate – has come under criticism for a series of claims which he later admitted were false. \nThese include that he lost “close friends” at the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, he has a PHD, and he had played for Tranmere Rovers. \nIn Copeland, Labour is focusing its campaign on the future of maternity services at a local hospital. \nThe party has put out leaflets claiming “mothers will die, babies will die” if the Tories are victorious in the by-election. \nTory MP Will Quince, whose son Robert was stillborn in 2014, has branded the campaign “disgusting”. \nOn Sunday, Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott blamed the polls on what she said was a “year” of “misrepresentation” of Corbyn by the media and some of his own MPs. \nAsked about Copeland and Stoke, she told Sky News’ Sophy Ridge: “If we lost one or we lose both, the party will go forward - it has to go forward. \n“For people who’ve been opposed to Jeremy from the very beginning – I’m not one of them – I think we have to move forward. \n“The point about the polls is you’ve had nearly a year of a sustained campaign against Jeremy and the Labour party, both in the media and sadly a few of our MPs,” she added. \n“I think, as we move beyond what has been almost a year of misrepresentation of Jeremy’s position, I think if you move beyond that and the more people get to see him and hear him, whether it’s in the media or at campaigning events, I’m confident the polls will improve.” More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:53:44.697+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
