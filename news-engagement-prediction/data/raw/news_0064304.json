More fruit and veg appears to cut the risk of cancer and heart disease Credit: PA \nResearchers from Imperial College found that although even the recommended five portions of fruit and vegetables a day reduced disease risk, the greatest benefit came from eating 800g a day - assuming that 80g is one portion - compared to people who ate none at all. \nBut even smaller intakes had benefits - a daily intake of two-and-a-half portions was associated with a 16% reduced risk of heart disease, a 4% lower risk of cancer and a 15% reduction in the risk of premature death. \nConsuming 10 portions a day was associated with a 24% reduced risk of heart disease, a 33% lower risk of stroke, a 28% reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, a 13% reduced risk of cancer, and a 31% reduction in the risk of dying prematurely. 33% The reduced risk of a stroke by eating 10 portions of fruit and veg a day 28% The reduced risk of cardiovascular disease by eating 10 portions of fruit and veg a day \nLead author Dr Dagfinn Aune said: \"We wanted to investigate how much fruit and vegetables you need to eat to gain the maximum protection against disease, and premature death. \n\"Our results suggest that although five portions of fruit and vegetables is good, 10 a day is even better. \n\"Fruit and vegetables have been shown to reduce cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and to boost the health of our blood vessels and immune system. \nHe added: \"It is clear from this work that a high intake of fruit and vegetables holds tremendous health benefits, and we should try to increase their intake in our diet.\" \nA separate study, meanwhile, published in the journal Thorax, found that a fruit and veg-rich diet is linked to much lower risk of chronic lung disease.
