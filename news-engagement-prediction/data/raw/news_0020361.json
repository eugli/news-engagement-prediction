They had seen a plane, mid-air, on fire. 'I immediately came out of the house and saw flames had engulfed the left engine,' the Gurugram resident told Mail Today. Bengaluru-bound Airbus A320 of GoAir (G8 557) had a narrow escape after the plane caught fire just seven minutes after takeoff from Delhi airport. (Picture for representation ) 'I was in shock for a moment and so were the others present there. I realised that a massive tragedy would occur if steps were not taken immediately. 'I immediately dialed 100 on my mobile phone to inform police about the incident.' The 187 passengers and six crew members on board the Bengaluru-bound Airbus A320 of GoAir (G8 557) had a narrow escape after the plane caught fire just seven minutes after takeoff from Delhi airport on Wednesday evening. By the time, the pilot had informed Air Traffic Control (ATC) and the plane made an emergency landing without any casualties. Navneet Kumar saw the Airbus on fire and immediately called the police Recounting the sight, Kumar said: 'It was quite dark but the aircraft was visible due to the fire.' 'We saw the plane for 10 to 15 seconds while it was crossing above the house and traveled quite a distance before it turned around and headed towards the airport for emergency landing.' The incident came days after two aircraft came face to face moments before one was to takeoff at Indira Gandhi International airport in the national Capital. An Indigo flight was headed towards the taxiway after landing just when a SpiceJet aircraft was preparing for takeoff on December 27. Hours earlier on the same day, a Jet Airways flight with 161 people on board veered off the runway and skidded into the field at Goa airport. Some passengers were hurt in the incident. Jet flight 9W 2374 was scheduled to fly from Goa to Mumbai at 4.40 am, but aborted the takeoff at the last moment as pilots detected a technical snag. The flight spun 360 degree before coming to a halt in the field inside the Dabolim airport premises. 'We received a PCR call about a plane catching fire mid-air above Najafgarh and when we enquired about the matter the airport operation control centre confirmed about the emergency landing of a GoAir flight,' said deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Sanjay Bhatia of IGI Airport. According to a top source at the airport, the pilot was aware that a technical fault had occurred in the left wing of the engine but did not know that it had caught fire. It was the local police that informed Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) officials and ATC passed on the message to the pilot. After detecting the technical fault and fire in the engine, the pilot of the Airbus sought permission for emergency landing and clearance of runway at IGI airport on priority. 'Following instructions about emergency landing, we placed fire engines and ambulance on standby to deal with any eventualities.' 'Airbus A320 has two engines on either side. The pilot made full emergency landing safely. All 193 passengers and crew members are safe and sound,' said a senior officer at IGI airport. The official pointed out that if the plane had stayed in the air for some more time, it could have led to a major tragedy.
