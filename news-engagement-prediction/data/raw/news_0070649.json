One is to turn on the oven or stove, and put on a pot to simmer away for a good few hours. I love this sort of slow, warming and hearty cooking, because it challenges the cold and grey outdoors. The other way, though, is to meet the weather head on with a riot of colour, an abundance of freshness and the wake-up call of citrus fruit. Today’s recipes for raw meals in a bowl excite me as much as stews and soups at this time of the year; in fact, they’re so quick that four out of five are practically instant, involving little more than just grating veg. They’re like the friend who opts for a bracing swim over a hot bath, the one who wears a vibrant winter coat amid the sea of black and grey. \nGrated veg may not seem the most obvious choice for the end of February, granted, but I challenge you to eat any of these dishes and not feel just a bit warmed (by the spices and all that grating), sweetened (by all the root vegetables), satisfied and enriched (by the nuts and cheese). Beetroot, plum and Dolcelatte salad \nAdd a few roughly chopped toasted hazelnuts, if you fancy some extra crunch. Serves four. \n4-5 raw beetroots, peeled and coarsely grated (350g) 3-4 plums, stoned and cut into 0.5cm-thick slices (250g) 20g basil leaves, large ones torn 5g picked tarragon 70g Dolcelatte, roughly broken into 5cm x 2cm chunks 1 tsp poppy seeds \n1½ tbsp sherry vinegar 1 tsp honey ¼ garlic clove, peeled and crushed 1 tsp fennel seeds, toasted and lightly crushed ¼ red onion, peeled and thinly sliced Salt \nWhisk all the dressing ingredients apart from the onion with a half-teaspoon of salt, then stir in the onion and set aside for about half an hour, so it softens. \nPut the beetroot, plums, half the basil and half the tarragon in a large bowl, pour over the dressing, then toss and transfer to a serving dish. Dot with the cheese, scatter with the poppy seeds, sprinkle over the remaining herbs and serve. Moroccan carrot salad with orange and pistachio \nThe orange blossom is a lovely addition to the dressing, but don’t buy a whole bottle just for the sake of a quarter-teaspoon. This salad is still lovely without it. Serves four. \n650g carrots, peeled and coarsely grated 2 oranges, peeled and cut into 1cm pieces ½ small garlic clove, peeled and crushed 50g pistachios, toasted and chopped 20g coriander leaves \n¼ tsp orange blossom water (optional) 2 tsp honey 1½ tsp cumin seeds, toasted and lightly crushed Finely grated zest of 1 lemon 3 tbsp lemon juice Salt and freshly ground black pepper \nWhisk the dressing ingredients in a bowl with half a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper. Add the salad ingredients, toss to coat and serve. Root vegetables with mango and curried yoghurt \nYou need fresh curry leaves here, not dried, so you’ll need to head to an Asian food shop. Serves two to four. \n2 medium carrots, peeled and coarsely grated 1 medium parsnip, peeled and coarsely grated ¼ small celeriac, peeled and coarsely grated ½ red onion, peeled and thinly sliced Finely grated zest of 1 lime, plus 2 tbsp lime juice 15g picked mint leaves 1 medium mango, peeled and cut into julienne strips Salt and pepper \n1 sprig fresh curry leaves (ie, about 10 leaves) 1½ tsp black mustard seeds 160g Greek-style yoghurt 2 tsp medium curry powder 1 tsp light brown soft sugar \nTo make the dressing, heat the oil in a small saucepan on a medium-high flame. Once hot, fry the curry leaves and mustard seeds for 45 seconds, then strain the oil into a bowl and transfer the leaves and seeds to a plate lined with kitchen towel. \nWhile the oil is cooling, put the carrot, parsnip, celeriac and onion in a large bowl with the lime zest and juice, then toss to combine. \nPut the curry leaves and mustard seeds in a medium bowl and add the cooled oil, yoghurt, curry powder, sugar and a third of a teaspoon of salt. Toss to combine, pour over the salad and toss again. Add the mint and mango, mix gently, so you don’t break up the mango, and season to taste. Sprinkle with the nigella seeds and serve. Hispi cabbage and kalette slaw \nThis is the only recipe here that doesn’t involve grated veg; it’s also not as quick to make as the others, because the cabbage needs time to soften. The sweet, spiced sesame flavour works deliciously with the cabbage. Kalette is a cross between brussels sprouts and kale that has a lovely purple-green colour; you can buy it in some supermarkets and greengrocers. Failing that, use purple kale instead. Serves four. \n½ hispi (or sweetheart) cabbage, core removed and leaves shredded into 2mm-wide strips 150g kalettes, quartered (or 90g purple kale), stalks removed and discarded, leaves shredded into 2mm-wide strips 2-3 oranges 1½ tbsp rice vinegar 1½ tsp maple syrup ½ tsp chilli flakes 50g flaked almonds, lightly toasted 2 tbsp sesame seeds, lightly toasted 25g coriander leaves, roughly chopped 25g mint leaves, torn 1 tbsp coriander seeds, toasted and lightly crushed Salt \nPut the cabbage and kalettes in a large bowl. Finely shave off three strips of orange zest (use a vegetable peeler) and put them in a small saucepan. Juice the oranges – you’ll need 200ml – and add to the pan with the soy, vinegar, syrup and chilli. Turn on the heat, bring to a boil and cook for five to six minutes, stirring frequently, until the juice has reduced to a syrup and you have about 60ml left in the pan. Pour into a small bowl, and whisk in the sesame and groundnut oils. Pour the warm dressing over the cabbage, toss and set aside for at least half an hour, ideally longer, to give the cabbage time to soften. \nTo serve, add the lime juice, almonds, sesame seeds, herbs and half the coriander seeds to the slaw, mix well and add salt, to taste. Arrange on a large platter (or divide between individual plates) and serve with the remaining coriander seeds sprinkled on top. Radish, daikon and green papaya salad Yotam Ottolenghi’s radish, daikon and green papaya salad. Photograph: Louise Hagger for the Guardian. Food styling: Emily Kydd. Prop styling: Jennifer Kay \nThe dried shrimp and fish sauce do mean this salad makes its presence known, but please don’t judge it by its smell alone: the taste more than makes up for it. If you can’t find green papaya, roughly grate peeled, cored granny smith apples instead – they work almost as well. Serves four. \n100g radishes (ie, roughly 12 breakfast radishes), cut into 3mm-thick slices (use a mandoline, if you have one) ½ medium daikon, peeled and coarsely grated (180g) ½ young green papaya, peeled and coarsely grated (or 180g grated granny smith apples) 10g Thai basil leaves (or regular basil) 10g mint leaves 40g salted roasted peanuts, lightly crushed with the flat of a knife \nFor the dressing ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T11:02:37.825+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
