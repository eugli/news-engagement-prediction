That wasn't the story though. \nWhat got tongues wagging among the hundreds who packed into the retail thoroughfare on a balmy Auckland evening was the height she cleared. \nWith space at a premium, her runup restricted to the 12-stride one she will confine herself to this Kiwi summer, and conditions challenging, to say the least, McCartney soared over 4.70 metres to equal her national indoors record achieved at the worlds in Portland last year and tick off a world champs qualifier in the process. \nREAD MORE: * Crouser predicts world record assault \nIt was also her best ever height off the short runup, and just 10cm off the PB she set at the national champs in Dunedin, and then equalled in claiming that memorable bronze in Rio. \nThe 20-year-old Aucklander, all things considered, was ecstatic with both her 4.70 clearance and the occasion in general. \n\"To be able to get up near my PB was just awesome,\" she said of the joy she exhibited when she soared over the 4.70 mark at her first attempt. \"My PB before now on this runup was 4.64, so I've got a PB for this runup as well. I'm super happy to be back up to the same heights even though I'm on a slightly shorter runup.\" \nAnd she gave the event, taking her beautifully balletic sport to the people of downtown Auckland, a resounding thumbs-up. \n\"It was pretty cool,\" she added. \"This is not a well-known sport in particular, and it's really good to see people are really interested in it and they want to come along and watch and learn. Ad Feedback \n\"I have to admit I was very nervous beforehand âˆ’ more nervous than usual, just because it's such a different situation. I just wasn't sure how it was going to play out. But the good thing about these sort of events is you get the adrenalin up and that really helps you run faster and get up on your poles.\" \nAnd, yes, she still finds it a little wired that the great majority of the people who crammed into The Atrium were here to see her. \n\"I still find that quite funny, but it's really cool. and it's awesome for the other athletes because they get to experience it, and people get to hear about them and see what they're doing as well.\" \nMcCartney gave her PB of 4.80 a decent crack, especially with her second attempt that went excruciatingly close, but admitted that the 4.70 clearance was a promising indicator indeed for what lies ahead. \n\"I don't want to jinx it but it's really, really exciting to be jumping this high, especially as I've only just opened a couple of weeks ago for the season. I couldn't be happier.\" \nLouisiana native Morgan Leleux, who thrilled the crowd by giving away Maris Gras beads after each of her clearances, finished second with 4.40m, shading Canadian Alysha Newman on a countback after she too stalled on the same height. \nKiwi teenage prodigy Olivia McTaggart was fourth on 4.10m, while her fellow national squad member Imogen Ayris had to settle for a best of 3.90m. \nNational champion Nick Southgate easily won the men's competition with a 5.20m clearance, comfortably clear of German Vincent Hobbie who showed the benefits of his training under Jeremy McColl out at the Millennium to clear 4.90m. \nSouthgate had a good crack at 5.40m and was slightly disappointed he couldn't get over at that height, which would have been just 7cm shy of his PB. \n\"It took a little bit of adjusting to with the different setting,\" he said afterwards. \"We're used to a little bit more space. But the atmosphere was that good it makes up for it. \n\"The 5.20 was not quite what I was hoping for. I had a couple of good cracks at 5.40 but just didn't quite get away with it. But I was on a shorter runup due to space restrictions, so Sunday [at the Auckland Track Challenge] I will be back to my full runup and hopefully smashing those heights.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:18:31.797+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
