Weeg attended River Ridge High School. AJC file photo Woodstock native Jackson Weeg struck out 18 in eight innings Saturday as Emory University beat Washington & Lee University 7-3 at Chappell Park. Weeg’s total surpassed Scott Kramer’s school record, set on April 30th, 1994, when Kramer fanned 16. Weeg’s previous career-best for strikeouts was 10, which he accomplished twice last season. Weeg, who attended River Ridge High School, recorded at least two strikeouts in each of his eight innings on the mound including striking out the side in both the fifth and eighth innings. He allowed three runs (two earned) on six hits and walked one to collect his first victory of the year. When the senior southpaw left the game in the eighth inning, he was not in line for the win as the game was tied 3-3 but the Eagles (5-0) scored four times in the bottom half of the inning.
