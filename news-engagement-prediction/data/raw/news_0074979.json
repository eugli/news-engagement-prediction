Thorne was just a child when she starred alongside Paxton on HBO’s Big Love , however, the 19-year-old actress still has some fond memories of starring alongside the Titanic actor. \nAccording to Entertainment Tonight , not long after it emerged that Bill Paxton had died at the age of 61 due to surgery complications, his Big Love co-star Bella Thorne took to Twitter to express her grief , saying “N #BillPaxton f**k. I love you man.” \nThorne continued her tribute to the late actor on Instagram, with a post saying “Oh my goodness… I don’t even know what to say. Thank you Bill for being such a good TV dad to me and spreading love on every set you work on,” she wrote. “My thoughts and prayers go out to your family. We love you #billpaxton #rip.” Alongside the heartfelt message, Thorne also shared a photo of Bill Paxton as his Big Love character Bill Henrickson in the HBO drama, which aired between 2006 and 2011 and received critical acclaim for the network. \nA post shared by BELLA (@bellathorne) on Feb 26, 2017 at 11:06am PST \nAccording to Hollywood Life , the 19-year-old actress played Tancy “Teenie” Henrickson , Paxton’s character Bill’s younger daughter. Whilst Thorne only joined the show for its final two seasons, she developed a close relationship with her on-screen dad Bill Paxton. The HBO show was about a fundamentalist Mormon family in Utah that practices polygamy. As such, Paxton’s character Bill Henrickson has three different wives throughout the course of the series and different children with each, creating a difficult family situation. \nOver the course of its five-season run, Big Love received widespread critical acclaim for its complex portrayal of American life. The series earned several major awards and nominations throughout its run, with Bill Paxton himself receiving several Satelite and Golden Globe Award nominations for his role as the show’s lead protagonist Bill Henrickson. \nRELATED STORIES ON INQUISITR :", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T18:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T13:26:58.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
