The sighting of the crossover in India hints at its probable launch in March.\nHonda has not officially revealed the details of the WR-V, which is said to be based on the Jazz platform. From the pictures, it is evident that it is the beefier version of the Jazz hatchback. The styling is similar to the BR-V, which is, in fact, the crossover version of the Mobilio MPV.\nThe Honda WR-V might possibly borrow the powertrain options from the Jazz. This means it will be powered by the 1.2-litre i-VTEC petrol engine and the 1.5-litre i-DTEC diesel mill. The former churns out 87bhp of power and 110Nm of torque, while the latter's power output is rated at 98bhp and 200Nm. Transmission options might include a five-speed manual for the petrol and a six-speed manual for the oil-burner.\nIt was recently revealed that the WR-V is headed to India when a couple of spyshots of the car at Honda's plant were released. Now that the Honda City facelift has already been introduced for the Indian market, the WR-V should be the carmaker's next offering. More details are expected to be revealed soon.\nImage Courtesy: Teambhp", "external_links": ["https://imgd7.aeplcdn.com/600x337/cw/ec/27201/Honda-WRV-Exterior-91129.jpg?wm=0", "https://imgd4.aeplcdn.com/600x337/cw/ec/27201/Honda-WRV-Interior-91127.jpg?wm=0", "http://www.team-bhp.com/news/pics-honda-wr-v-being-shipped-dealerships", "https://imgd8.aeplcdn.com/600x337/cw/ec/27201/Honda-WRV-Exterior-91128.jpg?wm=0", "https://imgd.aeplcdn.com/642x361/cw/ec/27201/Honda-WR-V-91126.jpg?wm=0"], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T10:19:54.465+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
