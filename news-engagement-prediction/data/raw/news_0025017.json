Claimed by Islamic State, the crash caused by a bomb explosion after takeoff killed 224 people. \nSo did the November 13, 2015 attacks in Paris that left 129 dead, and the truck rampage in Nice July 14, 2016 that killed another 84. \nBut the list omits the attack on the satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo in Paris on January 7, 2015, which claimed 12 lives. However, the lethal attacks the following day on a policeman and at a supermarket, in which four people were killed, are listed. \nAmong the US terror attacks, the White House lists the country’s deadliest since the September 11, 2001 — the bloody assault at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, June 12, 2001 that left 49 dead. \nThe perpetrator of the attack — Omar Mateen, an American of Afghan origin — is given only as “US person.” \nAlso on the list is the December 2015 shooting in San Bernardino, California by a husband and wife who killed 14 people in a massacre allegedly inspired by Islamic terror groups. They also are identified as “US persons.” \nThe list includes other attacks that received massive media coverage at the time: Istanbul (45 dead) in June 2016; Sousse, Tunisia (38 dead) in June 2015; Brussels (31 dead) March 2016; Dacca, Bangladesh (22 dead) in July, 2016; and Berlin (12 dead) in December. \nThe president’s latest salvo against the media comes amid a raging legal battle over his travel ban on refugees and nationals from seven predominantly Muslim countries. \nThe new administration says the executive order denying US entry to refugees, and nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries, is needed to protect the country against terror attacks. \nOpponents of the action say the measure stigmatizes Muslims and fuels Islamic State’s anti-Western propaganda. \nare/jm/ch", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T02:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:18:52.283+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
