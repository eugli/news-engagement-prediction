When it happened, I said, ‘Where did the time go?’” \n“At 90, I’m still going pretty damn good,” he said on still performing for a crowd. “And it’s nice because I have no plans to slow down.” \nDON RICKLES RECOVERING FROM FLESH-EATING DISEASE \nAccording to Rickles, time flies when you’re having fun, which is why he never plans on retiring. \n“I don’t practice or write stuff down — everything I do onstage was just made up before I went on,” he told the publication on his popular acts. “You can’t please everyone, but I’ve been fortunate in that my fans are in my corner.” \nThe New York City native didn’t always feel this way. After serving in the Navy during World War II, Rickles pursued acting at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. However, his mother noticed a hidden talent. \nDON RICKLES DOESN'T HAVE TO BE POLITICALLY CORRECT, FAMOUS COMEDIANS SAY \n“When I was at temple affairs or any other kind of function, my mother would say, ‘Get up there,’ and I was always able to make people laugh,” added Rickles. “Little by little, I started to take it seriously.” \nToday, Rickles still prefers to show off his comedic wit to fans and he insisted that his love for performing hasn’t dwindle with time. \n“When it’s 10 people or 300 people, an audience is still an audience,” said the comedy icon. “If people keep showing up to see you, then it’s still a high.” \nThe latest issue of Closer Weekly featuring Don Rickles is currently on newsstands.
