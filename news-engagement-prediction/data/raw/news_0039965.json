We're probably going to find out it's the biggest single fitout of all time,\" he told the chamber. \"And we're asked as a committee to just tick off $250-odd million of expenditure because there's a lease incentive from a landlord? \n\"Well I don't think we're going to do that.\" \nSenator Gallacher was left furious last year when the Department of Finance told the committee a lease on its new state-of-the-art offices would cost $194 million but the true cost was later revealed to be of $376 million . \nTurnbull government MP David Coleman also raised concerns about the lease incentives at a committee hearing last week. \n\"It is a lot of money. It suggests that the rent must be a very large number,\" he said to departmental officials. \"It is only really truly a lease incentive if you are paying a low rate for the lease in the first place.\" \nOfficials were unable to tell Mr Coleman what percentage of the department's rent they would get back in the form of lease incentives, saying only \"the rent rates per square metre are very competitive\". \nThe department refused to reveal other details, citing commercial-in-confidence concerns. \nThe fit-out is due to begin in August this year and be completed by February 2021. The upgraded buildings would accommodate 6000 staff. \nThere will also be $12 million worth of new security upgrades. \nAt the hearing last Friday, departmental officials said the cost per square metre of the fit-out would be approximately $2250 - still well above average - but did not explain how they arrived at that figure. \nThe department had originally wanted to bring all its Canberra-based public servants under one roof but a successful lobbying effort from commercial interests at the department's present location in north Canberra forced a backdown . - with Noel Towell", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T13:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T08:28:01.046+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
