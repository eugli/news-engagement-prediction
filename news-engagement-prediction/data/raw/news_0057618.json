Fotolia Natalie Paris , Travel writer 22 February 2017 • 10:13am \nP acked with old fashioned amusements, big and sandy, and safe for swimmers - Weymouth's beach has been voted the very best in the UK. \nFlanked by a harbour and backed by an attractive row of Georgian buildings, the Dorset town's gentle curve of golden sand was named as this year’s number one “travellers choice” beach by TripAdvisor users. An old-fashioned ice cream stall at Weymouth Credit: John Harper/John Harper \nNot only did it beat other British favourites, such as Cornwall’s numerous sandy coves and Norfolk’s dune-backed expanses, but Weymouth was also held in higher esteem than many Mediterranean beaches, coming ninth in a ranking of Europe's top 10. TripAdvisor’s top 10 beaches in the UK Weymouth Beach, Weymouth, Dorset St. Brelade’s Bay Beach, St Brelade, Jersey Luskentyre, Isle of Harris, Scotland Woolacombe Beach, Woolacombe, Devon Porthminster Beach, St Ives, Cornwall Bournemouth Beach, Bournemouth, Dorset Perranporth Beach, Perranporth, Cornwall Hengistbury Head, Bournemouth, Dorset \n“Head to Weymouth to recapture the nostalgia of childhood family holidays,” said Paul Clements, writing for Telegraph Travel. “On its famously golden sands, Punch and Judy still hammer it out several times a day, near the donkey rides and carousel. For a British beach holiday any more quintessential, you’d have to bring out the cucumber sandwiches while swatting away wasps with sticks of pink rock. \n“A haven of simple pleasures – the Georgian Esplanade is a parade of penny arcades, tea rooms and chippies, dominated by a statue erected in 1810 in the king’s honour – Weymouth is more than its majestic beachfront. Slap on some sunblock and head out in a boat into some of the best sailing waters in northern Europe. It also makes for the perfect jumping-off point to explore the Jurassic Coast – a 95-mile strip of sandstone cliffs and fossil-rich prehistoric shoreline 185 million years in the making.” “Head to Weymouth to recapture the nostalgia of childhood family holidays” \nTripAdvisor’s list of UK beaches is notably lacking in choices from the east and the north of the country, but that hasn’t stopped Weymouth & Portland Borough Council from celebrating. \nCllr Jason Osborne, for Tourism and Culture, was delighted. “For a British beach holiday any more quintessential, you’d have to bring out the cucumber sandwiches while swatting away wasps with sticks of pink rock.” Credit: John Snelling copyright 2012/John Snelling \n“The award reflects the hard work that is done by the borough council and its partners such as Dorset Waste Partnership, local businesses and the community,” he said. “It’s a great start to the year and hopefully signals a successful season ahead for Weymouth and Dorset.” \nIn second place came the renowned surfing beach of Fistral, in Newquay, Cornwall, which was also voted eleventh best in Europe; while third went to St. Brelade's Bay Beach , located in St. Brelade, one of the 12 parishes of Jersey in the Channel Islands.

Which beaches have they missed off? \nOur list of Britain’s best beaches rates several stretches of sand in the South West, including Porthcurno in Cornwall, “arguably the county's most beautiful bay”, Blackpool Sands , near Dartmouth, “a sheltered and peaceful crescent of fine shingle, backed by wooded hills, with calm turquoise water”, and Studland Bay in Dorset, “four miles of pristine white sand, which shelves gently into milky-blue waters, with a backdrop of dunes and heathland.” \nBut it also highlights plenty of special beaches in other corners of the country. \nIn Suffolk, Walberswick , is a long and empty stretch of sand, save for the odd crabber.
