To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nIn that respect, the awkward Beatty cock-up seems to symbolise the old Hollywood dying off and giving way to greater variety and less circle-jerking. \nIt’s also now crystal clear that ‘Oscars buzz’, a golden mist that hovered around La La Land for months on end, is really just bulls***. The Moonlight team belatedly accept their award (Picture: Kevin Winter/Getty Images) \nIt’s a shame that no celebrity panellist acknowledged, during the rather flimsy TV commentary on Sky, that Moonlight was the most deserving winner, obvious though that was. \nEgg is firmly on their faces now. \nSo thank you, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway. \nYou’ve inadvertently robbed Chazelle of yet another Oscar, while rescuing what could have been a sad 89th Academy Awards, with Moonlight only taking Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor for Mahershala Ali. \nLa La Land may have scooped six Oscars to go with all their freshly-minted Box Office dough, but they didn’t get that Best Picture cherry on top. And that’s a positive omen. \nMaybe next year the Academy can nominate a wider variety of films so hype doesn’t determine what people see at the cinema. Well, we can dream, can’t we, Damien? What is Moonlight about? Everything you need to know about the Best Picture Oscar winner \nMahershala Ali and Alex R Hibbert star in Moonlight (Picture: REX/Shutterstock) \nWhat’s the plot? \nMoonlight is a coming-of-age film , charting the life of Chiron across three defining chapters of his life – starting out as a young black man growing up in turbulent Miami, it follows his ongoing struggles with his sexuality and unstable family life. \nAs we follow his life through his teenage years and into manhood – the film becomes a much broader inspection into identity as a whole. \nIs it any good? \nIn our review , we described the film as ‘extremely moving’ which ‘speaks of the struggles of black men in marginalised communities, of the push and pull of nature versus nurture, and finding yourself – no matter how long it takes.’ \nCan I see a trailer? \nYes, yes you can. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nWho’s in it? \nMain character Chiron is played by three different actors over the course of the film: Alex R. Hibbert plays his younger self, Ashton Sanders plays his teenage years and Trevante Rhodes plays Chiron in his adult prime. \nPlaying his close friend Kevin is another batch of three actors, including Jharrel Jerome, Jaden Piner and Andre Holland. \nThe film also boasts an excellent supporting cast, including Mahershala Ali (Best Supporting Actor for his role as drug dealer Juan), Janelle Monae as Teresa and Naomie Harris as Paula. \nWho’s behind the camera? \nBarry Jenkins has directed the film and also written the screenplay. \nWhere can I catch it? \nMoonlight is currently showing in UK cinemas now. \nDon’t forget Metro.co.uk is live in Los Angeles with all the action so stay with us for regular updates. \nWant more of this lovely stuff?
