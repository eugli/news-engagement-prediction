Cole.\nAs time wound down, Cole drove and sank a jump shot with 6.2 seconds left to put St. Anthony up by one. Cole's shot proved to be the game-winner.\n\"We had to stay together and we fought to the end,\" said Cole, who finished with 26 points. \"I had two bad turnovers, so I wanted to make up for it with the last shot.\"\nCamden coach John Valore did not call a timeout, allowing the rest of the game clock to wind down.\n\"We were in transition and the ball went to the right person,\" Valore said when asked about his decision to not call a timeout. \"I wouldn't have got a better situation if I called a timeout because they would adjust and the ball would be down the far end.\"\nHurley, a Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer and winner of 1,181 games against just 123 losses, said that Camden is an excellent team led by an even better coaching staff.\n\"It was a sectional final atmosphere,\" Hurley said. \"They made great adjustments during the game. I think we just responded very well.\"\nCamden, the No. 2 team in the Inquirer Top 25, fell to 16-6. But the Panthers said they weren't going to dwell on the loss.\n\"We beat good teams and now we just lost by only one point to one of the best teams in the state,\" Thompson said. \"We are going to take this into the playoffs and win this whole thing.\"\nThe Panthers beat No. 1- ranked St. Augustine, 49-46, last Saturday. Victories like that show his players have the will to compete and always come to play, Valore said.\n\"They believe in each other and play exceptional defense throughout the year,\" Valore said. \"The competition they face propels them to play hard.\"\nSt. Anthony 14 16 13 17 - 60\nCamden High 17 13 14 15 - 59\nSAHS: R.J.
