In a photo from the ad, the pop star is plopped on a leather couch holding the red drink while looking dapper in a maroon velvet jacket and plaid pants. EXCLUSIVE: Cindy Crawford Revisits Her Classic 1992 Super Bowl Ad “Yes, we went there... #SB51 @drinkbai,” the Trolls star captioned the pic. Where exactly he went remains to be seen, but a video preview of the 30-second slot shows him looking around the room, with the beverage company captioning the clip, “When the Big Game is on, make sure nobody messes with your spot on the couch. #SB51 #happybdayjustin.” According to People , the ad will feature a surprise guest -- perhaps battling the former boy bander for the best spot on the couch?
