That’s the kind of statement that, in another time and place, would have been greeted with an out-thrust palm and a hearty “Sieg heil!” Here in this time and place, however, it demands a different response: \nJust who the hell do you think you are? \nMeaning you and all the other trolls you have brought clambering up from under their bridges. Maybe you didn’t notice, but this is the United States of America. Perhaps you’ve heard of it? Nation of laws, not of individuals? First Amendment? Freedom of the press? Any of that ringing a bell? \nPitts, who won the 2004 Pulitzer Prize for commentary, is the author of a syndicated column and several books. Just before the inauguration, Pitts wrote that he “refused to accept” Trump as “the new normal.” \nA Twitter user told Pitts his latest column was “spot on” and “harsh.” Pitts replied: Oh, it was meant to be. https://t.co/cImc4Md5Qx — Leonard Pitts, Jr. (@LeonardPittsJr1) February 16, 2017 \nAnother Twitter user criticized the writer for attacking Trump. Madame, your president-sadly, mine, too-is an idiot. Not reporting it would be journalistic malpractice. Not knowing it would be delusional. https://t.co/sSaPPvnmaf", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T12:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T08:03:12.052+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
