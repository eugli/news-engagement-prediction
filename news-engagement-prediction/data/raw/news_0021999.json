The ex-factor came back to haunt Rita Ora, and we're not talking about her gig on Simon Cowell's singing competition show. The 26-year-old British beauty was grilled about her ex-boyfriends, Calvin Harris and Rob Kardashian, during Thursday's episode of Watch What Happens Live . EXCLUSIVE: Rita Ora Reacts to Beyonce and Jay Z's Baby News: 'They're Just Bosses at What They Do' Despite appearing alongside The Bachelor's Nick Viall, viewers seemed to be more interested in Ora’s dating history. \"Help me. Help me, please,\" the America's Next Top Model host joked after a caller asked for her opinion on Harris' Twitter rant against his other ex, Taylor Swift. \"Get me a drink. A strong one!\" As the line of questioning intensified -- and host Andy Cohen pointing out that she brought Harris along for a previous WWHL visit -- Ora revealed that she and the 33-year-old producer are actually \"good friends.\" \"The thing is I don't keep grudges with anybody,\" she explained before addressing Harris' Twitter drama. \"Everybody uses social media how they want. I choose not to, so that's just my personal way to express myself. But everyone does their own thing.\" WATCH: Rita Ora Shows Off Toned Bikini Body for New Photo Shoot Ora also admitted that it's not easy to go through a breakup in the public eye. \"But, you know, you just take it with a pinch of salt and keep going with your own life and just make the most of what you are,\" she told Cohen. When asked if she ever dated Zayn Malik, Ora responded with more lighthearted banter. \"I feel like I'm getting completely roasted right now for no reason,\" she replied before putting Vaill on the spot. \"He's had four seasons of finding love and I'm getting scrutinized for who the f**k I'm dating! No way is this happening!\" While the audience laughed at her jokes, Cohen prodded Ora on her former relationship with Kardashian. \"Have you've watched any of Rob & Chyna and thought 'Wow I really dodged a bullet?,'\" he asked. Ora responded with a sweet message to Kardashian and his fiancee, Blac Chyna. \"Nothing but positive energy from me,\" she added. \"Congratulations to the family!\" As for her work life, Ora has been busy promoting ANTM and Fifty Shades Darker , the latter of which hit theaters on Friday. Ora reprises her role as Christian Grey’s sister, Mia, in the steamy film sequel starring Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan.
