Twelve Western classical pieces. An international school with a 115-year-old history. This weekend, music lovers can experience a concert with a difference. Kodaikanal International School presents a music performance that’s a culmination of years of learning by their students. \nAccording to Principal Corey Stixrud, this is the first time students and teachers of the school’s music programme are performing in such a format in the city. “Our school was started 115 years ago by American missionaries,” says Stixrud, over telephone. \nTheir music programme is as old as the school itself. “I’ve seen photos of our band from the mid-1920s in our archives,” he explains. Music has always been a big part of the school’s curriculum. “It’s a wonderful reflection of its learning.” \nAlika Khosla, Admissions and Exchanges Coordinator, explains that the hour-long event will feature performers from India, China, Korea, the U.S., Vietnam, and Germany. Given the school’s approach to music — Alika says that music is a subject in the school and students are graded on it, much like Math or Physics — their students have gone on to pursue their undergraduate studies in Music. \n“While classroom music is a part of their regular routine, these students have been practising since October to bring this concert to the people of Chennai,” explains Alika. \n“The performance will consist of a string quartet, vocals, chamber singers and a wind ensemble,” she adds. “There will be solo as well as ensemble performances. It’s quite an assortment.” \nThe concert will be held at Thyagaraya Hall, T. Nagar, on February 11, 6 p.m. The event is open to those interested in western classical music. \nFor details, call 9486361548", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T12:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T08:51:40.075+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
