If Cousins had remained with the Kings, he would have been eligible for a $209 million extension this summer, a deal that only Sacramento could offer under the rules of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. By being traded, Cousins is now eligible for an extension worth approximately $180 million, a loss of close to $30 million for Cousins. \nAccording to ESPN's Brian Windhorst , teams were not offering more for Cousins because his agents were telling teams not to trade for him and that he won't sign an extension with any team that did trade for him. Presumably, it was a move to keep Cousins in Sacramento until he could sign the larger contract. \nThis may have also played a factor in why the Kings did not wait until closer to the deadline. \nAs teams were being scared away by Cousins' agents, they may have been lessening, or even pulling, their offers. In fact, Kings General Manager Vlade Divac said he had a better offer two days before the trade they made. The Kings may have been worried the Pelicans would do the same, possibly taking their focus off of Cousins and turning it towards somebody like Jahlil Okafor of the Philadelphia 76ers, another big man on the trading block. \nRonald Martinez/Getty Images \nBut here is where it gets even uglier for the Kings. According to several NBA insiders, including Adrian Wojnarowski of The Vertical, the Kings lied to Cousins' agents about wanting to trade him, and NBA agents are not happy. \n\"We know that Vlade Divac, their GM, had been very, publicly and privately, had been pretty emphatic that they were not going to do this,\" Wojnaroski said on his podcast . \"He came out publicly and said, 'I'm not going to trade Cousins at the deadline. He's going to be here. We want to re-sign him.' And he told that to Cousins and he told that to Cousins' agents, Jarinn Akana and Dan Fegan.\" \nFormer NBA executive Bobby Marks was a guest on the podcast with Wojnarowski and explained how dangerous this move was for the Kings, saying, \"If you burn an agent in this league, they do not forget.\" \n\"You never come out and say a player is not going to get traded or 'we're going to sign this player to an extension,' because anybody in this league is tradable,\" Marks told Wojnarowski. \"I think it can have some long-term implications here. If you look at Dan Fegan, a powerful agent. When you look at Jarinn and who he represents. When we get into free agency with Sacramento, a team that is going to possibly have some cap flexibility. When we get into the draft, we don't know yet whom they will represent, but if you burn an agent in this league, they do not forget here.\" \nOthers have seemingly confirmed this thought, noting that this deal has hurt the Kings in the eyes of many agents. \n\"Several agents have already told me that [Sacramento] has lost all credibility after assuring Cousins he would not be traded this year and extended,\" Keith Smith of FanRagSports wrote on Twitter . \nSteve Kyler of Basketball Insiders also suggest that this deal did not sit well with other agents. \n\"[The] way Kings handled Cousins situation not going unnoticed in agent community,\" Kyler wrote . \"Most understand moving on but they told him they were committed.\" \nIn the end, the deal the Knigs ultimately made may have been their best option if they were convinced Cousins had to be dealt. But it sounds like the way they went about it could hurt the franchise beyond just this one deal and well into the future.
