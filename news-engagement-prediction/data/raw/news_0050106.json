(Photo: ANI) NEW DELHI: After PM Narendra Modi said yesterday that \"if there is electricity during Ramzan, it should be there on Diwali too\", the Congress party, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the CPM have slammed him for making what they call \"communal\" and \"irresponsible\" comments. Yesterday, at a campaign rally in Fatehpur in Uttar Pradesh, Modi said \"there should be no discrimination on the basis of caste or religion\", BJP4U, the twitter handle of the party tweeted. \"Agar Ramzan mein bijli aati hai, to Diwali me bhi aani chahiye, bhedbhav nahi hona chahiye (If there is electricity during Ramzan, it must also be available during Diwali, there should be no discrimination),\" the PM said. धर्म के आधार पर भेदभाव नहीं होना चाहिए, अगर रमजान में बिजली मिलती है तो दिवाली में भी बिजली मिलनी चाहिए: पीएम @narendramodi फतेहपुर, यूपी pic.twitter.com/sFQVF6a9gN — BJP (@BJP4India) February 19, 2017 He then also said \"if there's a 'kabaristaan' (graveyard), there should be a 'shamshaan' (cremation ground) too\", PTI and ANI reported. Muslims bury their dead in graveyards and Hindus cremate their dead. Gaon me kabristan banta hai to shamshaan bhi banna chahiye;Ramzan me bijli ati hai to Diwali me bhi ani chahiye;Bhedbhav nhi hona chahiye-PM pic.twitter.com/tOKd87XYna — ANI UP (@ANINewsUP) February 19, 2017 The Congress party said today that it will file a complaint with the Election Commission (EC), against PM Modi, \"over (his) highly deplorable statement in Fatehpur rally\", a Congress party lawyer KC Mittal told ANI. \"He must not give such wrong and irresponsible statements. EC should take note of PM's statement, this is a clear violation of their directions:,\" said Congress spokesman Anand Sharma to ANI today. CPM leader Sitaram Yechury also slammed the PM's comments as being \"communal\" and \"intended to divide Hindus and Muslims\". 'हिंदू-मुस्लिम' के नाम पर जनता को बाँटने का नतीजा यह देश एक बार 1947 में देख चुका है। क्या मोदी देश को वहीं वापस ले जाना चाहते हैं? — Sitaram Yechury (@SitaramYechury) February 19, 2017 Yechury said people need jobs not comments of his nature. The people of UP need jobs, better lives and livelihood, not talk of cremation sites or graveyards. — Sitaram Yechury (@SitaramYechury) February 19, 2017 AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal tweeted yesterday that Modi's religion-tinged comments \"show that the BJP is going to badly lose the (ongoing) Uttar Pradesh elections.\" Kejriwal reiterated that Modi's \"nervous\" about the March 11 results of Assembly elections in five states. मोदी जी का ये बयान दिखाता है की भाजपा UP में बुरी तरह हार रही है और मोदी जी बहुत नर्वस हैं https://t.co/CIutV19Ogd — Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) February 19, 2017 The CPM's Yechury also called Modi's a comments a \"sign of desperation\". This desperation to win state elections, by fanning communal divides, diminishes the dignity of the office of the Prime Minister. — Sitaram Yechury (@SitaramYechury) February 19, 2017 Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.
