Durkin | 12:01 am, February 12th, 2017 \nSNL ‘s Beck Bennett reprised a cable news role of his from this season on tonight’s episode: CNN’s Jake Tapper , who gets an unexpected visit from Kellyanne Conway in the form of a Fatal Attraction parody. \n“I just want to be a part of the news, Jake,” she says after she breaks into Jake Tapper’s home when the CNN anchor refuses to book Conway due to her credibility issues . “What was I supposed to do?” she said, after forcing herself onto the State Of The Union host. \n“You’re sick, Kellyanne!” Tapper says in his desperate defense. He offers other CNN programming opportunities for her to appear on. \n“ Fareed Zakaria ?! I have an office in the White House!” she says, before asking if she is deserving of the same pity bookings that Kayleigh McEnany gets. \nAn exhausted Tapper finally says, “You’re a monster!” before she falls backwards out of a window in the dark and twisting sketch. \nThe sketch is a decidedly harsher tone than the one the comedy show opted for earlier in the season, back when Conway was simply the Donald Trump campaign manager; McKinnon and Bennett appeared in a sketch at the time about the strained Conway trying uselessly to enjoy a well-deserved day off . Tonight’s episode of Saturday Night Live is hosted by Alec Baldwin with musical performances by Ed Sheeran , and check out Melissa McCarthy ‘s return to as the podium-ramming press secretary Sean Spicer from earlier tonight .
