They gave up a late third-period goal in a loss at San Jose after the break. And they had to hold on for dear life to protect a one-goal lead at lowly Arizona. But against a desperate Stars team trying to climb back into the playoff picture, the Hawks responded in a big way. Patrick Kane scored the equalizer on a breakaway, and Trevor van Riemsdyk notched the game-winner as the Hawks pulled out a rollicking 5-3 victory that will make the team’s Super Bowl party that much more enjoyable. \nGustav Forsling (right) celebrates his goal with Dennis Rasmussen in the second period on Saturday night.

Jonathan Toews added an empty-netter with 0.9 seconds left. “Huge,” Hjalmarsson said. “I was screaming at him on the bench. That obviously would have been a goal otherwise. That was a key save. It would have been a tap-in.” After Radek Faksa’s seemingly harmless fling from a sharp angle somehow snuck behind Corey Crawford just eight seconds into the second period, the Hawks dominated the rest of the period — led by their rookies. Tanner Kero chased down a Marian Hossa chip-in pass and made a nice feed to Hartman for the equalizer at 6:20 of the second. Three minutes later, Gustav Forsling made it 2-1 when his shot shattered Patrick Sharp’s stick and fluttered underneath the crossbar. The Hawks had 18 shots on goal in the first 12 minutes of the period. But Benn tied it just 40 seconds into the third. Then, at 9:24, Tyler Seguin took advantage of a Forsling turnover behind the Hawks net and slipped the puck between Crawford’s legs to give Dallas a 3-2 lead.
