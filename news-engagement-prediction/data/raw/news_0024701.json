Adam Tomkins, Scottish Tory constitution spokesman \nMs Minor said it would have to apply from scratch and follow the usual accession process joining a list of candidate countries including Montenegro, Serbia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. \nThe head of representation for the European Commission in the UK said Scotland would have to commit to joining the euro and tackle its Â£15 billion deficit to meet membership rules. \nAnd she also poured cold water on Ms Sturgeon's plan for a Norway-style deal warning there was \"no precedent\" for differentiated arrangements between parts of a partner country. \nOpposition politicians seized on the remarks challenging the SNP to be \"honest\" with voters over its plans for separation. \nScottish Tory constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins said: \"For all its moaning about Brexit, it knows fine well an independent Scotland would not simply step into the European Union. \n\"Not only would it join the back of the queue, but we now learn it may have to adopt the euro and tackle an eye-watering deficit. PA PA The First Minister has repeatedly threatened to call a second referendum \n\"It's time for the Nationalists to be honest about Brexit and stop using it as a tool to agitate for separation.\" \nScottish Labour's Europe spokesman Lewis Macdonald said: \"As the SNP was repeatedly told during the (2014 independence) referendum campaign, an independent Scotland would have to apply to join the EU like any other country. \n\"Alex Salmond tried to dismiss this, despite all the evidence to the contrary. Now it's time for the SNP to be honest with voters - an independent Scotland would have to join the queue.\" \nEarlier, Ms Minor suggested an independent Scotland would have to wait several years to apply with Commission President Jean Claude Juncker ruling out any further enlargement while he is in office until 2020. \nReferring to those currently seeking membership she added: \"Were Scotland to become independent, they would join that list.\" Scotland Referendum Fri, September 19, 2014 More than 3.6m people turned out to vote in the Scottish independent referendum, resulting in a 'No' vote with 55.3%.Here we take a look at the public's reaction.

GETTY Brussels said Scotland would have to join the back of the queue to gain membership to the EU \nThe EU considers anything above 3 per cent of GDP to be \"excessive\" and can impose financial penalties on and/ or withhold payments to member states which exceed that figure. Ms Minor said \"that would be one of the issues Scotland would have to address\" \n\"It would have to come forward with plans as to how it is going to reduce its deficit,\" she added. \nAsked about the prospects of a special deal for Scotland in Brexit negotiations she replied: \"I have to say that there is no precedent whereby a free trade agreement has distinguished between significant regions of the partner country.\" Sturgeon's top moments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T02:05:55.117+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
