They always denied having a leader, but Tony Davis, who has died at the age of 86, was their frontman, spokesman and publicist. He introduced many of their songs, cajoling the audience to sing along on the choruses of their Liverpool sea shanties and well-known folk songs; one of their favourites was Pete McGovern ’s In My Liverpool Home . Their biographer, David Stuckey, described Tony as the group’s “powerhouse, their energy source”, and, at 6ft 7in, he towered above the others, playing the banjo and whistle, enthusing everyone he met.\nHe was born in Blackburn, to Arthur Davis, an insurance inspector, and his wife, Elsie (nee Dowell). When Tony was three, the family moved to Merseyside, settling in Wirral. After leaving Wallasey grammar school, where he discovered jazz and played the clarinet, he had a variety of jobs, but was invalided out of his national service due to osteoarthritis. At teacher training college in Manchester, he played in the jazz band of the local art school, before learning the guitar. Back on Merseyside, he started the Gin Mill skiffle group with his wife, Beryl, and Mick Groves, whom he had met at college, and they were popular performers in the pre-Beatles Cavern Club.\nAs skiffle waned in popularity, Tony and Mick sought out the song evenings of the local branch of the English Folk Dance and Song Society (EFDSS). Sedate singing from books was not what they had hoped for, but they stuck at it. In 1958, they first performed as the Spinners: Tony and Mick were joined by the guitar-maker Stan Francis, Tony’s sister Joan and Beryl.\nBy the end of the year they had started a Friday night folk club, one of the first in the north of England. After the opening evening, they travelled overnight for the EFDSS’s English Folk Music festival, in London, and were selected for the showcase concert in the Royal Festival Hall. Joan, Beryl and Stan were soon replaced by Hughie Jones, the only true Scouser in the group, the Jamaican Cliff Hall and, for a short while, Jacqui McDonald, who left to form the folk duo Jacqui and Bridie.\nThey were regular weekend visitors to London, singing at the Troubadour club, as well as at EFDSS headquarters, Cecil Sharp House, where they searched the library for repertoire. Encouraged by the popular entertainers Flanders and Swann, the Spinners organised their own concert at St George’s Hall in Liverpool . Then Tony spent the family’s monthly housekeeping money promoting their first concert at the city’s Philharmonic Hall in 1964: its success ensured that the Davis family could eat. Two live albums of the concert were released: Folk at the Phil and More Folk at the Phil.\nThe Spinners first album, Songs Spun in Liverpool, had been released in 1962, quickly followed by Quayside Songs Old and New. They then signed to Philips, releasing an album a year for eight years on their Fontana label. This coincided with the group turning professional, and the recording of a BBC television series, Dance and Skylark, broadcast in 1965. Several TV series followed, including concerts from the Octagon Theatre, Bolton, and on-location recordings that invariably involved them dressing up to suit the song. Although some folk fans were dismayed by their easy listening performances, there is no doubt that their relaxed style and enthusiasm took folk music to new audiences.\nAfter more than 40 albums, some enjoying chart success, the Spinners retired in 1988 and Tony returned to his first love, jazz, bringing his enthusiasm to both its performance and promotion. He hosted Tony’s Tradtime on Jazz FM, performed with the Tony Davis Band and, with Beryl, organised concerts that raised thousands of pounds for charity.\nTony is survived by Beryl (nee Holmes), whom he married in 1956, his daughters, Jacky and Susan, and four grandchildren.\n• Antony John Davis, folk and jazz singer, born 24 August 1930; died 10 February 2017", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lUl9HaFbN8", "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/pete-mcgovern-6104427.html"], "published": "2017-02-21T20:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:14:44.780+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
