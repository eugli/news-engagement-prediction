By: PTI | Chauri Chaura | Published: February 22, 2017 10:37 PM Shah made these comments while seeking to draw a parallel between the rival parties and the Mumbai attack perpetrator Ajmal Kasab. (PTI) \nBJP President Amit Shah today dubbed Congress , SP and BSP as “KASAB”, adding yet another acronym in the Uttar Pradesh poll campaign, and said development will elude the state till “Kasab is laid to rest”. Elaborating on the acronym at an election meeting here, he said, “Ye Uttar Pradesh ki janata is baar ke chunav mein is Kasab se mukti paa le. Main phir se bolta hu Uttar Pradesh ki janata is baar ke chunav mein is Kasab se mukti paa le. Kasab se mera matlab kuch aur mat nikaliyega. Kasab se mera matlab hai- KA se Congress, SA se Samajwadi Party aur B se BSP.” \n(In this election, people of UP should get rid of Kasab. I say it again, people of UP should get rid of Kasab. Do not take any other meaning when I say Kasab. What I mean by KASAB is — KA for Congress, SA for Samajwadi Party and B for BSP.) \nShah made these comments while seeking to draw a parallel between the rival parties and the Mumbai attack perpetrator Ajmal Kasab. “Until and unless Kasab is laid to rest, development and prosperity will continue to elude the poll-bound state. \nWatch this also: \n“In other words, it means that the state may have to languish further, if there is no respite from these political parties,” he said. \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has coined ‘SCAM’ for SP, Congress, Akhilesh and Mayawati, and dubbed BSP as ‘Behenji Sampatti Party’. BSP supremo Mayawati has described BJP as ‘Bhartiya Jumla (rhetoric) Party’ and punned with Modi’s initials saying they stood for “Mr Negative Dalit Man.” Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav had his own explanation for SCAM — Save Country from Amit Shah and Modi.
