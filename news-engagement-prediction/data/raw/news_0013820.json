This translates into a 1,304 per cent return during this period, when the benchmark NSE Nifty climbed nearly 35 per cent. \n\nWith a market capitalisation of Rs 1,477 crore (as of Feb 8), Dalmia Bharat Sugar is engaged in manufacturing of sugar, generation of power, manufacturing of industrial alcohol and manufacturing of refractory products. \n\nEven beyond Dalmia Bharat, there are 12 other stocks on NSE that have delivered over 500 per cent return to investors during this period. \n\nThe list includes ITD Cementation (up 1,092 per cent), Aarti Industries (up 792 per cent), Sterlite (up 739 per cent), Sundram Fastener (up 671 per cent), BEML (up 550 per cent) and Jubilant Life (up 498 per cent). \n\nMarket experts are positive on the outlook for the domestic equity market. Gaurav Dua, Head of Research at Sharekhan, sees the Sensex around the 33,000 mark over the next 12 months. \n\nGlobal brokerage firm Morgan Stanley on Thursday said it expects the Sensex to touch the 39,000 mark by this December in a ‘bull case’ scenario. The brokerage has a base case (50 per cent probability) target for BSE Sensex at 30,000, a bull case scenario (30 per cent probability) of 39,000 and a bear case scenario (20 per cent probability) of 24,000. \n\nSector-wise, Morgan Stanley is ‘overweight’ on consumer discretionary, financials and technology and ‘underweight’ on consumer staples, energy, materials and telecom. \n\nLargecap stocks such as HDFC Bank (up 103 per cent), Indian Oil Corporation (up 230 per cent) and Maruti Suzuki (up 277 per cent) also doubled investor wealth since February 14, 2014. \n\nOther gainers include Bajaj Finance (up 615 per cent), Finolex Cables (up 496 per cent), Bajaj Finserv (up 440 per cent), Eicher Motors (up 392 per cent) and Prism Cement (up 346 per cent). \n\nSML Isuzu, Trident, Ajanta Pharma and PC Jeweller were among the stocks that have soared between 300 per cent and 400 per cent in the past three years. \n\nThere have been many laggards, too. For instance, Bhushan Steel , Just Dial, Reliance Communications , Jindal Steel and Adani Enterprises have declined 87 per cent, 73 per cent, 71 per cent, 61 per cent and 57 per cent, respectively, in these three years.
