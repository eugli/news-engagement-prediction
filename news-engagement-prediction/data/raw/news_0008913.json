Article continues below \nHis next move was just a couple of years later as Tottenham signed him, where he become a club legend. He endured a disappointing six months at Liverpool in 2008 before a return to White Hart Lane. \nLoan spells at Celtic and West Ham followed, before signing for LA Galaxy in the MLS. He returned to England to join Aston Villa on loan but ultimately enjoyed five seasons in the United States before leaving in November 2016.

But we’re not going to put it past him. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
