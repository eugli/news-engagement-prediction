Vellayan said the crocodile could have escaped from a farm or was dumped into the river by its owner.\n“It could also have escaped and washed into the river during the heavy downpour.\n\"There are also people who keep baby crocodiles as pets and another possibility is that it was dumped when they could not cope with it anymore,’’ said Dr Vellayan.\nHe added that if the crocodile had travelled to the spot on its own, it would either be with a partner or was in a pack.\nAnother possibility, said Dr Vellayan, could be that the crocodile was an alpha male which had left its group.\nRelated story:\nCroc sightings triple", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T06:00:35.325+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
