(Alberta Federation of Labour )\nNearing the halfway point of its mandate, the NDP government has been studying the Alberta Employment Standards Code, the Labour Relations Code, and the Occupational Health and Safety Act.\nAnd although there have been amendments over the years, some labour laws have remained untouched since 1976.\n\nBob Barnetson, an associate professor of labour relations at Athabasca University, says there are key areas on the government's radar that, if changed, would make it easier to organize unions and land a first contract.\n\nBarnetson says Alberta has among \"the most regressive labour laws\" in Canada.\nHe says bringing in what's known as \"first-contract legislation\" and a \"card check\" system of certifying a union would lead to more organized workplaces in Alberta.\n\nFirst contract, or first-arbitration legislation, would impose a first contract through arbitration, if a contract couldn't be reached through bargaining, according to Barnetson.\n'Alberta law needs to be updated to make sure that Albertans have the same kind of rights and protection in the workplace that are enjoyed by other Canadians.' - Gil McGowan, President, Alberta Federation of Labour \n\"It sounds far more Draconian than it actually is,\" Barnetson says, adding that the existence of legislation is an incentive for employers to work through the process to reach a collective agreement.\n\nA \"card check\" system of forming a union requires employees to simply sign a card or petition. The current system in Alberta requires a mandated follow-up vote by members 10 days after registering with the Alberta Labour Relations Board.  \n\n\"The delay that goes on between applying and having the vote gives the employer the time to terrorize the bargaining unit and put a chill on the organizing drive,\" Barnetson says.\n\n\"When you go from card check to voting, certification applications drop by half and there's a significant drop in the success rate.\"\nAmber Ruddy, director of provincial affairs for the CFIB, says it's not the time to be layering on new regulations for small business. (CFIB)\n\nThe Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) says although its members support balanced labour laws, it wants to participate in any discussion before changes are made.\n\nAmber Ruddy, director of provincial affairs for the CFIB in Calgary, says if the government is considering a \"modernization\" of labour laws, they should be considered \"thoughtfully and thoroughly.\"\n\nWith 10,000 small and medium-sized employers, Ruddy says most don't have the benefit of administrative support or human resource departments to adjust to new rules or regulations.\n\n\"If there are significant changes to any areas, vacation allowances, paid leave, any further requirements, we'd want to see those proposals come forward right away and have small business owners weigh in,\" Ruddy said.\nFormer Alberta oilpatch workers hesitant to return as activity picks up Nearly one in five Alberta workers earns $15 an hour or less, advocacy group says Many businesses are still struggling in a fragile economy, she added. \n\n\"It's not a great time to be layering on new costs and new regulations,\" Ruddy said.\n\nIf the government does want to bring in \"progressive\" changes, it will face pushback, McGowan says.\n\n\"There's no doubt that right-wingers and some in the employer community will claim that the sky is falling,\" he said.\n'Work life in Alberta has changed a lot' \nLabour Minister Christina Gray said in an emailed statement she is committed to reviewing Alberta's labour laws to ensure they reflect today's workplace, but declined to specify what changes are coming.\n\n\"Albertans deserve modern, fair and family-friendly workplaces,\" Gray said.\n\"In some cases, Alberta's labour legislation has not been reviewed in decades.
