I parked in the usual place. \n“You Can’t Put Your Arms Around A Memory”, a jagged, soulful lament by ex-New York Doll Johnny Thunders rumbled from my CD player. \nI had 17 months to choose that song – the one I would play just before walking back into work. \nThrough my rear view mirror I saw Yakub Qureshi, a mate, fine journalist, and one of many who never forgot me. I got out of the car, put my arm around Qureshi, and we walked into the MEN. \nIt was the start of three years’ grace from a disease which will forever hover over me. \nI grasped the chance. Remission is the starting gun to extra time – the most terrifying and euphoric period of life. \nDuring those 36 months I moved up the gears in the newsroom and re-emerged as the tetchy veteran let down by his temper and saved by his work ethic. I embraced more time with my wife, Felicity, and kids, Patrick, Grace, and Anna, and friends. \nThe skin and bones which had taken a pounding courtesy of life-saving treatment at Manchester’s Christie Hospital responded to hope. \nPeaks were climbed in the Lake District, moors, and country lanes walked, and treks across Beswick and Ancoats to see MCFC bear golden fruit with memories of Paris St Germain, Real Madrid, and Barnsley.

But on September 12th 2016 I attended Christie to get the results of a routine three-monthly scan. \nProfessor Robert Hawkins saw me a few days later and seemed concerned, even borderline upset. The removal of my left kidney in 2012 was due to a 7cm limpet-like tumour growing around it. \nNow cancer was back – in my remaining kidney. \n“There’s a growth. It is 1.6cm. There is no doubt,” said Prof. He had saved my life three years earlier and was as stunned as Felicity and I. \nWordless we drove back to Whitefield. I decided to pop the silence. \n“You backed the wrong horse darlin’. You should have stuck with that little hippie (her previous boyfriend ). I bet he’s as fit as a fiddle in his allotment in his bloody dungarees, with his headphones on listening to early Genesis.” \nShe laughed – job done. \nMy options were stark. They were either a partial nephrectomy – cutting away some of my solitary kidney to remove the tumour; a keyhole procedure to zap the growth by freezing it; or a watching brief. With my form, ‘wait and see’ was never on the cards. After seeing surgeon Vijay Ramani I chose the most radical route – removing half of my last kidney. \nMr Ramani explained it would be a complex procedure. This time the tumour was INSIDE the kidney, close to crucial plumbing which drains the urine. Before the operation I had to see a straight-talking and optimistic kidney specialist. \nHe explained that if the procedure failed and I lost my kidney I would be on dialysis – a life changer. \nDialysis could be customised to my lifestyle to lessen the burden. \n“You could be put on a dialysis machine at night, so you can wake up and get on with work and living,” he said. \n“Sexy” was my reply, “OK Fliss, fire up the Quattro, I am up for it.” \nOn November 22nd – the day President John Kennedy was shot – I bit the bullet and arrived at The Christie for the operation feeling fit, strong, and bemused. There had been no symptoms this time. No fatigue, no night sweats. Neal Keeling after being named the Trinity Mirror regional news journalist of the year winner.

He had given me odds of an 80 per cent chance of success and delivered. \nNow the real fight began. During surgery I had required two pints of blood, and such a loss was anticipated. But as I lay in a high dependency unit my mental and physical resources wilted. \nI was so anaemic I was given another two pints of blood. \nMr Ramani visited the unit and asked: “Tell me how you are feeling.” \n“I’m slipping away,” was my honest response. His answer to that was “I’m not going to let you.” \nThe painkillers required to diminish acute tenderness around the wound site were issued on an industrial scale. \nOne night a nurse, aged 24, had the task of dealing with my inability to eat, drink, sleep, or chill out. I was having vivid nightmares – due to the drugs I was on and environment I was in. Every patient within a few feet of me was seriously ill or worse. \nThe pinging of monitors never ceased. I asked nurse Genna for permission to hold her hand. I just needed human touch to survive. The drugs were unlocking dark memories which I thought were buried – the heart thumping chaos of watching my parents’ marriage disintegrate in the early 1970s. \nThe nurses were comforting, upbeat and despite the sadness enveloping the unit, flashed smiles letting their wealth of experience or naivety of youth handle the task of caring for those on the brink. \nAfter five days in the high dependency unit I was finally moved to a room in the Christie Clinic. But I was running on empty. \nMr Ramani, wearing an immaculate black suit and white shirt entered the room. He had a controlled swagger, a rock ‘n’ roll star in the world of surgery – looking like Withington’s answer to former cricket god, Imran Khan. \nHe looked me right in the eyes and delivered a bouncer. “Right, no more feeling sorry for yourself. You either eat or I take you back to the HDU and put you on a nutritional drip.” The Christie (Photo: Mark Waugh) Read More \n“So you’re playing hard ball,” I said. “Yes I am.” “OK I get it.” \nA nurse winced as he made his ultimatum, but it was exactly what I needed. \nWithin 15 minutes I put away three spoonfuls of soup. The catering staff got used to my minute portions and backed me like fans of an ailing but much loved football club – Aston Villa love really. But the HDU had left deeper scars than an ocean of nausea and no appetite. \nI was a morphine sozzled morsel of manhood weakened by sleep deprivation, and a psychosis triggered by too long in an intensive care unit. \nMy lad has a quip for everything – a lovely side effect from watching years of dross and joy at Maine Road with me. His eyes rolled when he saw me in white surgical stockings pulled up to my thighs. “Christ Neal, what are you wearing,” he asked. I reassured him I was planning a post op career at Manchester’s Bird Cage. \nHis card last June, on that day when dads across the country are showered with respect, said: “Thanks for trying to be a father.” \nPatrick, his sisters, and his mum were constant visitors during my two weeks in hospital. \nBut at my lowest ebb I did something which went against all my limited and flawed principles as a father. I let my guard slip and revealed fear. \nPaddy was holding my hand as I lay exhausted but unable to rest with no end in sight to the tailspin I was in. \n“I’m scared mate,” I told him, petrified at my inability to remain stoic. I regretted saying it immediately. He stayed another 30 minutes before leaving upset and numb with worry. \nThe night before his older sister, Grace, had remained as I was convulsed by a violent episode of nausea. I was at rock bottom. \nNostalgia, the unstinting support of the family, and a very well spoken lady from Stockport made up the revival cocktail. \nRemembering stirred a strange survival package. I was back on the football plains of Walsall. Wearing a thick cotton shirt, in a perfect ‘Heart of Midlothian’ maroon, with white neck and cuff trim, white shorts, and white socks with two green hoops at the top, I was playing for my school. \nJoseph Leckie Comprehensive always looked the business – shirts tucked in, never flapping in the Black Country breeze. I was the owner of an amazing piece of machinery – the heart of a 15-year-old boy, which pumped pure stamina.

Every Saturday afternoon I fell black and blue into my mum’s bath – and went back for more. The boy was helping the pale expressionless man. \nPhysiotherapist Hilary Farrer wore very sensible shoes and said politely: “I want you to be thinking of me as ‘that cow’ within a few days.” \nWhen we first met I was catatonic, mentally shackled to a chair next to my bed – defeated. \nShe began her regime with a simple breathing exercise and the turmoil began to evaporate. Within 20 minutes I had walked to the door of my room. The next day she was taking my arm and we made it into the corridor for a 20 yard ‘sprint’. \nI was now being weaned off the drugs, but some doubted I was ‘clean’. I turned to my wife and said: “You look beautiful tonight,” and without hesitation she responded: “You’re on morphine, mate.” \nPhysically I rebuilt myself – rising to 11 stone after dropping to 10. Much tougher was accepting I had another chance. Post op I met Ramani who was rightly beaming after successfully preserving a ‘kidney remnant’ which is allowing me to live normal life. \nBut the journalist in me was not happy with that. I couldn’t help myself and asked: “What’s the bigger picture here – is this just a case of cutting away another bit until it comes back.” \nHe looked crestfallen, then said: “What you need is a bit of luck.” \nThen came advice from one who really knows. “You either live with the fear of it coming back and let that mangle you...or, and I hate this phrase, you live each day.” \nMy wife, as ever, was spot on. At 18 she was a student nurse on the wards at North Manchester General, then a ward sister, and later ran a Macmillan Information Centre at the same hospital. \nMessages from colleagues and friends, were an inspiration. One texted: “2016 was a pile of s...but it spared you, so it wasn’t all bad.” \nMy torso now resembles a street map of Ordsall. One and a half kidneys have been removed, adding scars to a mega fishbone-style one left when I was six weeks old and needed life-saving surgery due to an intestine blockage. As I jumped into Salford’s Broughton pool and swam like a man reborn no one gave a second glance.
