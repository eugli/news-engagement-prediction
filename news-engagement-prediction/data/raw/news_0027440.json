German publication Bild is reporting that Schalke will pay Spurs £16.2m when Bentaleb makes his next appearance for them. \nOriginally, the deal in place called for the move to be made from a loan to a permanent deal after 20 appearances. But factoring in his African Cup of Nations sabbatical last month, that number has been revised to 18, with 17 games already under Bentaleb's belt. \nIt is believed that the midfielder would sign a four-year contract with Schalke and his current preference is to stay in Germany rather than return to north London and fight for his place. \nSpurs have gone from strength to strength this season and the midfield base of Dembele and Wanyama has been one of their most crucial partnerships. \nPerhaps it is best for both parties that Bentaleb makes that 18th appearance. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
