Ever presents \nC onte this month described Fàbregas as a “genius” for his ability to spot passes and create goals, and the former Arsenal captain has surprised a number of people with the way in which he has fought for his place. \nFàbregas has proved he can make a big impact when starting or from the bench and could expect more opportunities next season with Chelsea set to make a return to the Champions League. \nBut his performances have also convinced his suitors, of whom AC are currently leading, that he would be the perfect summer acquisition.
