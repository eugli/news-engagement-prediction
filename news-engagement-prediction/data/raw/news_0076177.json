An offseason trade for Chicago White Sox ace Chris Sale added to an already star-studded pitching rotation featuring Cy Young winner Rick Porcello and David Price. Jackie Bradley Jr. and Xander Bogarts lead a stacked lineup into Boston's first season without David Ortiz manning the cleanup spot. \nThe Red Sox are also flush with advantages deep inside Fenway Park. According to the Boston Globe , for the 2017 season, the team will debut what they've dubbed a \"sleep room,\" a 145-square-foot space with two sets of bunk beds where players and coaches can get in a power nap ahead of home games. \nInside what resembles a college dorm room, Sox players will be able to curl up on beds outfitted with custom mattresses, pillows and sheets from Bedgear , a \"performance bedding\" company with which the Red Sox recently signed a sponsorship deal. The company produces pillows based on the way you sleep at night (if you're a \"stomach sleeper\" or a \"side sleeper\"), and its sheets are sort of like dry-fit clothing in that they wick away sweat and heat during the night. \n\"Sleep is probably the most important thing we talk to them about,\" the team's head athletic trainer Brad Pearson told the Globe . \"It's critical to their recovery. You pick the low-hanging fruit first, the simple things. You create a stable base and build on that.\" \nAs pro sports teams continue to look for any and all ways to keep their players as healthy as possible throughout long regular seasons with insane travel schedules, sleep has pushed to the front of the line in terms of importance. Countless NBA teams monitor their players' sleep habits with wearable technology, and it appears that MLB teams like the Red Sox are hopping aboard the sleep train. \nThe Red Sox \"sleep room\" is set to be ready by opening day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T20:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T06:28:29.129+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
