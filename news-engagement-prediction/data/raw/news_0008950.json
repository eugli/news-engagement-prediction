The South Australian Senator’s defection would open up a big problem for the Prime Minister. Senator Cory Bernardi set to defect from the Liberal Party according to new reports Claire Bickers, News Corp Australia Network February 6, 2017 9:05am \nMALCOLM Turnbull is facing a major headache when Parliament returns this week with maverick senator Cory Bernardi expected to split from the Liberal Party in coming days. \nSpeculation that the South Australian senator could split from the Liberals to form his own party — the Australian Conservatives — has mounted over the past few months. \nColumnist Andrew Bolt reported Senator Bernardi could defect from the Liberals this week , while other sources said the move could happen within the next two days. \nThe news comes amid more dire polling numbers for the Prime Minister , with the Liberal primary vote slumping to 32 per cent. \nEarlier this month, Bernardi updated his social media accounts, removing almost every reference to the Liberal Party. \nHe also signalled a “massive” year for the Australian Conservatives in a blog post in December after operating since mid-2016 with “modest staff numbers and a bare bones website”. \n“This is all set to change in 2017,” the post said. \n“Our new state-of-the-art website is almost ready to go, and we will be launching it early next year, along with a number of important campaigns.” \nSenator Bernardi loudly praised President Donald Trump’s election win in November, claiming Australian politicians were not doing enough to listen to the average voter. \nHe spilt with his party’s line on a number of key issues last year and loudly opposed any return to an energy policy that included an emissions trading scheme, a move that prompted the Prime Minister to rule out any form of carbon tax within 24 hours. \nIt’s understood Senator Bernardi may have the backing of Australia’s richest woman Gina Rinehart, if he does break away from the Liberals. \nThe pair met key members of President Trump’s campaign team in Washington in November, including former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani and campaign manager Kellyanne Conway. \nIt’s understood Senator Bernardi was also invited on a luxury cruise by Ms Rinehart over summer. \nMore to come ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T00:29:59.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
