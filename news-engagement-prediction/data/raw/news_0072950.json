West recently filed paperwork to launch Donda cosmetics, a line of perfumes, lotions, makeup, and other cosmetic products. Donda, of course, is an homage to his mother who tragically passed away in 2007.\nHere is my Donda chart that I wrote 4 years ago that everyone laughed at… pic.twitter.com/g1po6Z3H55\n— KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) February 15, 2016\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below If this business move seems out of left field—it's actually not. Back in April of 2009, West signed a licensing deal alongside Rihanna and Jay-Z to launch a line of perfume with Parlux. He was the only one of the three to not have any scents come to fruition. We reached out to a rep from Parlux, and apparently West's deal fell through at some point before Parlux was merged with Perfumania back in 2012. Knowing what we know about West, he probably has 400 fully-cooked perfume ideas raring to go. All he needed was the infrastructure.\nConsidering Kanye West has shown a preference for little to no makeup at his Yeezy shows, we can't visualize what a line of cosmetics would look like from him. (Our money is on a color palette of all nudes.) There's no word yet on when Donda cosmetics will be launching, but maybe he can grab a few pointers from his sister-in-law Kylie Jenner beforehand.", "external_links": ["https://t.co/g1po6Z3H55", "http://www.tmz.com/2017/02/23/kanye-west-donda-cosmetics-kylie/", "https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/699108088687755264"], "published": "2017-02-23T23:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:31:37.170+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
