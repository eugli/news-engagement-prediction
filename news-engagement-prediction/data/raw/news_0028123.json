Dwyane Wade (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 9:49 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 9:49 a.m. ET \nThe Heat were the lucky winners of the 2010 free agency sweepstakes when they retained Dwyane Wade and acquired LeBron James and Chris Bosh. \nThe Big Three went on to win multiple titles together in Miami, but it could have been a possibility in New York. Appearing on \"The Vertical\" podcast, Wade revealed the trio was looking at the Knicks as a potential destination, but ultimately decided against it. \nMORE: Charles Oakley, James Dolan move toward truce in meeting with Adam Silver \n“They just wasn’t prepared. They wasn’t ready to take on what we wanted to do,” Wade said. “The city? Yeah, the city was ready. The market? The market was there. It’s New York. But (from) an organization standpoint, we didn’t feel like they could handle it. \n“At this point in our career, this is the prime of our career. This is the meat of it. This decision is going to make or break your career, and we really had to make a decision where it really made sense. And Miami, the structure was there for us. It worked out. But when you talk about markets and cities, Chicago and New York is the biggest that we was reaching out to. But it was never something that we was serious (about), that I knew I was serious about when it came down to it.” \nWade's comments sort of reinforce the idea that the Knicks aren't an ideal organization to play for. When free agency rolls around, players won't be jumping at the opportunity to play there, despite the market and the great history that comes with the franchise.

James mentioned this in the past, but Wade says it's not that serious. However, he says he hasn't ruled it out, either. \n\"I don’t think none of us have shut the door on it,\" Wade said. \"But would it be too late by then? Would the game have passed all of us by? Who knows. But it is something to think about, something to put in back of your mind.\" Watch This", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T21:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T17:02:34.386+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
