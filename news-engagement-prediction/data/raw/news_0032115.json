No scrub that, it’s just plain wrong. \nAny thoughts Bunnings might have altered their format, even a touch, for their multi-billion push into the UK market is clearly not the case. If it works in Australia, it’ll work in England, seems to be the mantra. \nThe logo is the same, the stores are identical, the sausages are sizzling even in the grey English winter and, now, it’s clear even the ads are direct copies of Australia’s Bunnings ads. \nHowever, a retail expert has said simply “copying and pasting” Bunnings Australia might be a misstep. \nIn the UK version, Bunnings employees at the first store in St Albans, just north of London, wax lyrical about the great range of brands and the lowest prices. So far, so similar. \n“The UK’s been waiting for something like this for so long,” says a staff member donning the famous green apron. ‘It’s minus 2C, we’re all totally loving being out here in the cold. This is fine.’ Source: Supplied \nBut, you know what, there’s just something so odd about it. About seeing such a long running and quintessentially Australian ad campaign reshot in Britain. \nMaybe it’s the blue Australian summer skies replaced by the leaden clouds above the UK store. Or that the staff look like they are shivering out in the cold. \nPerhaps it’s the fact some of the staff look really unsure about the whole thing. “The possibilities in the store are … are … endless,” says one staff member seemingly unsure of what they were supposed to say or why they have had to suffer the torture of being forced onto national TV in the first place. \nBut really, it’s the accents. \nAll those Pommy accents. Bunnings UK ad video is all a bit wrong \nThis is most obvious at the end of the ad where the usual “Bunnings Warehouse!!!!” jingle shouts at you from the screen. With a new English twang, it just sounds all wrong. \nIt’s like the cast of Geordie Shore has been plied with alcopops all evening and about midnight were asked to scream the jingle as loud as they could. You know, just for a laugh. \n“We’ve been waiting with bated breath to see the first store opening and now it’s very clear that they are copying and pasting what works very successfully in Australia and New Zealand with very little change,” Insight DIY manager Steve Collinge told news.com.au last week. \nHowever, he said importing an Australian model was a risky move. \n“They’ve got to learn that they can’t just copy and paste what works in Australia and hope that people are going to be queuing up for a sausage sizzle in the rain. It’s one degree in the UK today. It’s a real challenge.” Exploring the new Bunnings Warehouse — Griffiths Way, St. Albans \nWhatever the merits of the ad though, you can’t fault Bunnings’ belief that Britain is going to be bowled over by their stores. \nAs it set about rebranding hundreds of Britain’s Homebase stores, the chain it bought last January, it have promised to price match competitors and have upped the wages for staff. \nThe revamped stores have 40 per cent more brands in stock and the number of staff have been nearly doubled.

I came in for one thing specifically which I found immediately ... then you find lots of other things you didn’t know you wanted,” she said, wheeling pot plants and furniture protectors back to her car.
