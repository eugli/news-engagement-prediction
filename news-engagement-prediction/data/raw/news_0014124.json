(SNL/YouTube) Alec Baldwin, playing Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live, tells a Malcolm Turnbull character \"Australia sucks. Your reef is failing. Prepare to go to war\". Source: \nMalcolm Turnbull has starred in this week's episode of Saturday Night Live, the legendary American sketch comedy TV show. \nActually, that's fake news wrapped in alternative facts. \nThe real Australian prime minister was not on the NBC network show. RELATED: Trump beheading Statue of Liberty cover sparks criticism German news magazine Der Spiegel sparks controversy with a cover depicting US President Donald Trump holding the severed head of the Statue of Liberty in one hand and a bloodied knife in the other. Trump defends Putin, says US has killers US President Donald Trump says he respects his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin and brushed off a description of him as a 'killer'. White House identifies Malcolm Turnbull as 'President of Australia' Just after White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer appeared to call Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull \"Prime Minister Trumble\" earlier this week, the White House has identified him as \"the President of Australia\". \nAn American comedian with a bad attempt at an Australian accent was in the PM's role to poke fun at last week's heated phone call with US President Donald Trump. \nOscar nominee Alec Baldwin was back playing Trump. \nThe skit, which opened the show, began with Trump in the Oval Office complaining to his chief strategist Steve Bannon. \nThe Bannon character is dressed in a grim reaper costume and has a Darth Vader-like voice. \n\"I've had a long day, I'm tired and cranky and feel like I could freak out on somebody,\" Trump says. \n\"Then maybe you should call Australia,\" Bannon suggests. \nTrump is not sure, says he has not been briefed on what to say, but quickly says: \"What could go wrong?\" \nThe president calls. \n\"Hello. Prime Minister Turnbull,\" the prime minister answers. \nTrump: \"Yes, hello it's the Donald.\" \nTurnbull: \"President Trump how are you? I hear there's been a lot of blowback over your Muslim ban.\" \nTrump: \"No there wasn't. Everyone loves it but we had to do it because of that huge massacre at Bowling Green.\" \nTurnbull: \"Never heard of that one\". \nEventually the prime minister thanks the president \"for still accepting our refugees\". \nThe president is shocked . \nTrump: \"No, no, no. No refugees. America first. Australia sucks. Your reef is failing. Prepare to go to war.\" \nTrump abruptly hangs up on the prime minister. \nThe president then looks confused and asks Bannon if the call was a bad one. \nBannon: \"No. It went just according to plan.\" \nTrump then calls Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and fails to trick him into paying for their multi-billion dollar border war and then calls German Chancellor Angela Merkel but it ends abruptly when she corrects Trump for pronouncing her name wrong. \n\"Germany sucks. Your wall failed. Prepare to go to war,\" Trump tells Merkel. \nBannon then suggests Trump call a smaller country and the president chooses Zimbabwe, but the leader of the African country abuses him and taunts: \"You think you're a dictator?\" \nThe skit ends with Bannon asking the president: \"Can I have my desk back?\" \nTrump tells Bannon: \"Yes of course Mr President. I'll go and sit at my desk.\" \nTrump walks to a child's desk next to the main desk in the Oval Office and joyfully plays with a toy.
