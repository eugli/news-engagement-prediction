And the cover, which captures the talented stars in one frame, is definitely for the keeps. Best Actor award winner Aamir Khan may be missing from the cover but that doesn't make it any less glittering. It is star power at its best as Shahid Kapoor, Alia Bhatt , Sonam Kapoor and Diljit Dosanjh grace the cover. \n\n\n\nWhile the 'Udta Punjab' trio of Shahid Kapoor (Best Actor: Critics' Choice), Diljit Dosanjh (Best Male Debut) and Alia Bhatt (Best Actress) dominate the left, veterans Shabana Azmi (Best Supporting Actress) and Rishi Kapoor (Best Supporting Actor) make their presence felt in full force along with Shatrughan Sinha who was honoured with the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award. Manoj Bajpayee takes the attention at the centre as he won many hearts as well as the Filmfare Best Actor: Critics' Choice Award of the year. Nitesh Tiwari registers his presence as the winner of the Best Director Award for 'Dangal'. \n\nThe lesser known face Ritika Singh who grabbed the Best Female Debut for the R Madhvan film 'Saala Khadoos' makes it to the B-town club in a casual get-up. Fashionista Sonam Kapoor shines among all in a stunning Elie Saab gown she wore for the gala.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T22:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:50:11.239+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
