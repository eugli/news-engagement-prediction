About 40 percent of Planned Parenthood’s funding comes from the government and goes to non-abortion-related services.\nOutside of Blackburn’s town hall, an estimated 100 people gathered because they couldn’t fit inside, with protesters carrying signs that read “Pretend that Russia is Planned Parenthood and investigate,” according to Politico. Even more protesters lined up along the road, some waving “I stand with Planned Parenthood” signs.\n@Scotttaylorva telling a woman who asked about Planned Parenthood funding at town hall to \"calm down\" pic.twitter.com/y5VSx9qgr0\n— Elyas Bakhtiari (@ElyasBakhtiari) February 22, 2017\nAt a Virginia town hall on Tuesday evening, Rep. Scott Taylor told an audience member to “calm down” when she asked what would happen to her health coverage if Planned Parenthood were defunded. He was quickly drowned out by angry booing. Earlier on Tuesday, Virginia’s Democratic governor vetoed a bill that would have cut the state’s funding to Planned Parenthood.\nAt Rep. Buddy Carter’s town hall in Savannah, Georgia, on Tuesday afternoon, people wearing pink Planned Parenthood shirts filled the room . Outside, even more demonstrators gathered holding pink signs that read “I stand with Planned Parenthood.”\nFull house with lots of #PlannedParenthood tshirts at @RepBuddyCarter town hall in Savannah pic.twitter.com/4uNmjjeJgr\n— Emily Jones (@ejreports) February 21, 2017\nAmong several groups organizing attendance, and sometimes protests, at Republican town halls around the country over the past week, Planned Parenthood is informing people where and when to attend the public meetings in order to express their support for the organization and ask their representatives not to defund it.\nJoin Planned Parenthood and our community partners tomorrow at Sen.

Jason Chaffetz that drew about 1,000 people. A particularly emotional moment came when a woman got up and identified herself as a cancer survivor who relied on Planned Parenthood for vital care.\n“Sir, can you please explain to me why you are trying to take that vital provider away from women like me?” she asked, drawing cheers.\nCancer survivor — who relies on Planned Parenthood for care — asks Chaffetz: “Why are you trying to take [it] away?” pic.twitter.com/yexjMZ7wz6\n— Dan Diamond (@ddiamond) February 10, 2017\nFew of the Republican politicians who have been confronted about the issue seem to have been swayed from their talking points. Chaffetz, like Rep. Taylor, said there were other community health center options available if Planned Parenthood closed, but he declined to delve further into the issue.\nOn Saturday, Planned Parenthood is holding a massive rally in Milwaukee (House Speaker Paul Ryan’s home turf) to protest Ryan’s push to defund the organization and repeal Obamacare.\nFollow Olivia Becker on Twitter: @oliviaLbecker", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ElyasBakhtiari/status/834219588388843521", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.vice.com%2Fstory%2Foutraged-planned-parenthood-supporters-are-descending-on-republican-town-halls", "https://twitter.com/reprotaylor/status/834233339787747328", "http://plannedparenthoodevents.ngpvanhost.com/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=tweet&utm_term=events-february17&utm_content=healthtwitter", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/PlannedParenthood?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/CassidyTownHall?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Outraged", "https://twitter.com/PPGulfCoast/status/834148776679981057", "https://t.co/yexjMZ7wz6", "https://t.co/y5VSx9qgr0", "https://twitter.com/Scotttaylorva", "https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QHICsW4EiTQ?iv_load_policy=3&#038;modestbranding=1&#038;rel=0&#038;autohide=1&#038;playsinline=1&#038;autoplay=0", "https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QHICsW4EiTQ?iv_load_policy=3&modestbranding=1&rel=0&autohide=1&playsinline=1&autoplay=0", "https://twitter.com/WTOCSeanEvans/status/834143631908929536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/RepBuddyCarter", "https://t.co/YhhjXHK1J5", "https://t.co/4uNmjjeJgr", "https://twitter.com/ejreports/status/834127494664028160", "http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/chuck-grassley-obamacare-town-hall-235232", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/IStandWithPP?src=hash", "http://twitter.com/oliviaLbecker", "https://twitter.com/ddiamond/status/829898876421169152", "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-virginia-plannedparenthood-idUSKBN1602L2", "https://www.facebook.com/events/1850872741848958/", "https://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/2114/5089/0863/2014-2015_PPFA_Annual_Report_.pdf"], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:11:48.448+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
