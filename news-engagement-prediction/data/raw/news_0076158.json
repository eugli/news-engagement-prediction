Photo: Andrew Meares \nSenator Abetz - a close ally of Mr Abbott and dumped from cabinet by Mr Turnbull - said the latest criticism of the government shouldn't be considered through the lens of leadership destabilisation and should prompt serious policy debate. \nMr Abbott reportedly told Liberal defector Cory Bernardi he wanted another tilt at the top job, prompting Mr Turnbull to describe the comments as \"sad\" while offering a strong defence of his record in government. \nSenator Abetz said the latest turmoil was contained to \"the Canberra bubble\". \n\"Just because somebody is putting forward a set of policies [they] should not be described as sad,\" he told Sky on Friday. \n\"These are all issues that are meritorious in themselves, worthy of debate and consideration without the unfortunate name-calling that has been engaged in.\" \nEarlier, the former employment minister told Tasmanian commercial radio Mr Abbott's criticism was not designed to undermine Mr Turnbull or to \"pump up Tony Abbott's tyres\". \n\"Given we have 5, 6 per cent rate of unemployment, does it make sense to keep encouraging a lot of people to come to Australia, knowing that some of the people who have come to Australia in recent times have been welfare recipients for over a decade? Is that adding to our economic and social wellbeing? The answer is no. \n\"The Liberal Party, the government at the moment, is lagging in the polls so it's not surprising that there will be active minds saying: 'How can we lift ourselves in the polls?' \nSenator Abetz said senior conservatives should not have been exiled from cabinet after Mr Abbott was rolled as leader in September 2015, an apparent reference to himself and former defence minister Kevin Andrews. \n\"Leadership requires that you bring everybody into the tent, that you ensure that everybody is listened to and respected. That is why I said right from day one when the leadership changed that the basic expulsion of senior conservatives out of the ministry was not going to assist party unity. I remain of that view.\" \nAsked if Mr Turnbull had his support, Senator Abetz said \"yes\". He said he wasn't aware of any planned moves against Mr Turnbull. \n\"The elected leader of the parliamentary party - whoever he or she may be - has my support,\" he said.
