By J. Emilio Flores/Corbis/Getty Images. Ever since the Academy Awards introduced the red carpet in 1961, the crimson-colored walkway has signified the height of Hollywood glamour. But for the press flanking Hollywood’s front line this Sunday for “the Super Bowl of red carpets,” that storied strip is more—a historic convergence of Hollywood’s elite for a night of career wins (and losses). And it is the press’s job to capture each big moment in a chaotic stream of couture and flashing cameras. Ahead, one veteran of the Oscars red carpet— Los Angeles Times photographer Jay L. Clendenin —takes Vanity Fair behind the fabulously frenzied scenes. What to Wear (When You’re Working the Oscars) While most men on and off the carpet this Sunday will stick to staid black or navy tuxedos, Clendenin takes a different approach—wearing a 70s-style, powder-blue tuxedo (complete with velvet collar, ruffled shirt, and pant piping) that he picked up from a Washington, D.C., thrift store about a dozen years ago. While the style choice might seem a bit . . . out there, it actually serves a practical purpose when he is wedged into a pen with tens of other red-carpet photographers, mostly in black, all angling for the starlet in front of them to look into his/her camera lens. “I don’t assume anybody ever remembers my name,” explained Clendenin, who has covered the Oscars red carpet for almost 10 years now. “But when they see the tux, they’re definitely like, ‘Oh, that’s that guy.’ I take portraits through the year for the L.A. Times too, so sometimes [actors] will recognize me because I photographed them. But mostly, there’s this recognition because of my glasses and goofy tux—usually from the guys.” Canned Sardines . . . with Bulky Cameras The red carpet may be glamorous, but it is not exactly comfortable—especially for the photographers locked into position in a pen. Inside the pen, the photographers are situated in two rows on risers—with the more prominent outlets placed in the front row. “We are usually against a hedge, and then there’s a row of still photographers behind us,” explained Clendenin. “But they tend to come off their riser and stand over our shoulders, so they are in there with us. It’s like sardines, there’s really no room. It’s awkward, especially if you shoot with two cameras. . .one to do full-length dress shots and a second camera with a longer lens, so you can [capture] details like the ring, the shoes, whatever. If you have two cameras, it’s a nightmare, because you are shoulder to shoulder. . . . It just becomes a pain, and then everybody gets a little gruff and starts pushing.” Why the Photographers Are Shouting The front-row photographers are able to get some interaction with celebrities—but the second-row photographers who have not smushed themselves into the front row have less luck. “We’re in the front row, so [any movie star] that comes down the carpet looks at us directly,” explained Clendenin. “So the majority of what you hear, when you hear photographers shouting, is, ‘To your left! To your left! Over the shoulder!’ For the majority of the entertainment photographers who are there, they need eye contact [for their photos]. They need the subject looking directly into their lens, or the photo doesn’t get used or sold. So it’s a real fight, and that’s why you hear yelling on TV. “Honestly, my favorite photos are always not camera-conscious—with the actor looking down. Or when Nicole Kidman looks back and fluffs her dress out . . . I love those in-between moments. But for the celebrities, it’s got to be obnoxious when you have 40 photographers yelling, ‘Over your shoulder! No, other shoulder! Left! I said left! Your other left!’ Like really obnoxious things. I can't even imagine, as a subject having to be berated with that stuff for like an hour as you make your way down the carpet.” “I don’t like people yelling in my ear so I’ve actually worn earplugs a few times,” laughed Clendenin. Out of the Picture There is nothing worse for a photographer than when a perfect shot is photobombed by a frazzled publicist. “On the Oscars carpet now, thankfully, the publicists have to move out of the way, they separate them. They used to be standing within two feet of [the stars] . . . so their arm was in [frame] because they're leaning over and grabbing [the actors] to pull them to the next spot.” There was a plus side though: “It was good because if we couldn’t get the talent’s attention, we could yell to the publicist, ‘Hey, I need her to look.’ And then they would tell the star, ‘Hey, look at the tux right in the middle.’ Now, we don’t have to worry about [them being in frame] but you’re really counting on getting an interaction with them so they’ll look at your camera.” Strike a Pose Fortunately, by the time the Oscars roll around, the nominees are well-versed in red-carpet shorthand, so that photographers don’t have to ask movie stars to—how to say this politely?—push their un-famous date out of frame. “The system is to say, ‘Okay, can we get a fashion?’ All of the talent knows that that means a single—so your date has to move over.’ If an actor does not know what that meant by the Oscars, I would blame the reps and agents who did not coach everybody on how this works. At this point in award season, everyone—even the spouses—know that is the separation point.” “The Worst of Humanity” As it gets closer and closer to show time, the red carpet gets more and more chaotic with late arrivals rushing down the red carpet, reporters and photographers frantically trying to flag them down for a photo or quote, and frantic handlers trying to usher everyone into the Kodak doors for the live show. “It gets ugly as you get closer to the door closing, because that’s when the super A-list show up. . . en masse,” explained Clendenin. “That’s where it gets really crazy. I always joke about it and say that [scene] would make the best video because it’s like the worst of humanity happening . . . photographers are yelling, and that’s when they get really rude.” “There is this mix of rudeness toward the talent when the photographer doesn’t feel they’re getting what they need, and then there’s a lot of rudeness thrown toward the show handlers who move people down the carpet,” Clendenin continued. “The [handlers] get a lot of shit from the photographers. It’s either, ‘Don't push the talent!’ Because they will reach out and grab the talent—so their arm gets in your shot.” (The only celebrity Clendenin has seen address this rudeness is Jane Lynch , whom he recalled telling Emmy photographers, “’Guys, if you don’t stop, I’m leaving.’ I remember that just shut everybody up.” The Red Carpet Pros “Some people are very good about just keeping their smile locked and then just looking from left to right to give every photographer his/her shot,” said Clendenin. “Then they step down to the next group of photographers and do the same thing . . . Lady Gaga is an example of someone who is phenomenal. She is just such a character and a show person . . . She comes out, spreads her dress out, and is very dramatic with it. She keeps her head down and she’s fixing everything, and then there’s this pose where her chin comes up, and the posing starts. She literally looks right at each photographer and makes her way down the line.” “That is the ideal,” continued Clendenin. “As opposed to somebody who just comes down, poses quickly, and then moves on to the next thing. But with someone like Lady Gaga, it’s fun to know that you've not only witnessed that cool showmanship but are able to document it.” Share ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:36:57.691+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
