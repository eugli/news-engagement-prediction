McCollum of the Portland Trail Blazers, none have been as productive as Lowry and DeRozan. \nDeRozan and Lowry combine to average a whopping 50.9 points per game, which is the best mark for a pair of starting guards in the league. \nTo compare, Curry and Thompson average 46.1 points and McCollum and Lillard put up 49.6 points per contest. \nLowry and DeRozan also average a respectable 10.9 assists per game, better than McCollum/Lillard (9.4) and Curry/Thompson (8.0). \nThe biggest challenge to DeRozan and Lowry's Eastern Conference dominance comes from Washington Wizards guards John Wall and Bradley Beal. Though that combo averages an impressive 13.9 assists per game, they only account for 44.7 points, so Lowry and DeRozan have the advantage. \nBut what makes DeRozan and Lowry so special, giving them an edge over the other duos, is that they complement one another perfectly. \nWhereas Curry and Thompson are both lethal three-point shooters, DeRozan doesn't attempt that many threes. Lowry, for his part, has knocked down 158 treys this year, good for the third most in the NBA, behind Curry and Eric Gordon. \nDeRozan does most of his damage at the rim and with a lethal mid-range jumper. Therefore, if teams try to stop Lowry at the three-point line, DeRozan will have plenty of opportunities to take over the game. Likewise, if teams focus on packing the lane to stop DeRozan, Lowry will feast. \nWithout a ton of help from the front court (there are no Kevin Durants or Draymond Greens in Toronto), Lowry and DeRozan have led the Raptors to a 30-19 record and third place in the Eastern Conference. \nAs the season wears on, the NBA's best bromance will continue to lead their team toward a top seed for the playoffs, where they'll be a dangerous combo for whatever team they match up against.
