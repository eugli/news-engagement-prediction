Once it would have been a groan, a despairing sigh. But now they’re more than used to reading pieces about Arsene Wenger almost signing a world class player. A little over a year ago, we published a terrific team made up of talents that the Frenchman missed out on. Look at it here. \nWe might have to consider updating that given his latest admission. Last summer, he tried to sign the best midfielder in England but missed out. We are of course talking about the one and only N’Golo Kante. The guy is an absolute phenomenon and a huge reason, perhaps the biggest, behind Chelsea’s nine-point lead at the top of the table. Was it the money? Probably \nWenger told journalists at his press conference about another near-miss: “Have I looked to sign Kante? Yes. When he was in France and when he was at Leicester. I cannot explain everything [about why he preferred Chelsea] but it is quite obvious when you look at where he has gone. Was it the money? I do not want to talk about that. \n“Transfers are transfers – you cannot explain absolutely everything.” In other words: It was the money. \nThat insinuated detail must make it extra frustrating for Arsenal fans. The club are really reluctant to compete with the biggest clubs in Europe when it comes to wages, hence the contract drama with Ozil and Alexis. \nKante could come back to haunt Wenger when Arsenal travel to Chelsea this weekend. Wenger: “We looked at Kante, when he was in France, & at Leicester, but it’s quite obvious what happened when you look at where he’s gone.” pic.twitter.com/YvT16pw2Sv \n— Arsène’s Son (@hughwizzy) February 3, 2017 Loading tags...
