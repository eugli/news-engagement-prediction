It is also celebrated in several other Asian countries and among Chinese communities worldwide.\nComments on the internet largely focused on what many Chinese view as a hawkish attitude by Mr Trump and his administration toward China, with many saying the lack of a greeting should be seen as a deliberate snub.\nInteresting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call.\n— Donald J.
