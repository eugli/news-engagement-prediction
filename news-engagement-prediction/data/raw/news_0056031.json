Sam Black | MSPBJ National homebuilder Mattamy Homes , the fifth-largest homebuilder in the Twin Cities, announced Monday it is selling all of its assets in Minnesota to fellow national builders CalAtlantic Homes and M/I Homes Inc. and will focus on other markets. Toronto-based Mattamy is the second national builder in less than a year to exit the home-building market in the Twin Cities. In March of 2016, K. Hovnaian Homes said it would leave the area to focus on other markets. Mattamy Homes was the fifth most active builder in the Twin Cities in 2014. Sam Black | MSPBJ Mattamy said it will still develop unfinished lots as part of its agreement with CalAtlantic and M/I and will continue to build and service the homes of current customers. The homebuilder has nine communities in the Twin Cities: Bayport, Carver, Chaska, Lakeville, Minnetrista, Otsego, Shorewood, Victoria and Waconia. Its neighborhood in Shorewood, located on the former site of the Minnetonka Country Club , is scheduled to open this spring. \"Minnesota was Mattamy's first expansion outside the Greater Toronto area, and over time has produced solid results for the company,\" said Peter Gilgan , Mattamy Homes founder and CEO, in a statement. \"However, Minnesota is not a long-term strategic fit for Mattamy's business in the U.S., as it doesn't align well in terms of our geographic focus. CalAtlantic Homes and M/I Homes both have a much larger presence in the Midwest and should benefit from the economies of scale afforded by this concentration.\" In 2015, Mattamy sold 295 units in the Twin Cities for a total of $109.76 million. More than half of those units were multifamily structures. Last month, Mattamy sold 13 lots in Minnetrista's Woodland Cove neighborhood to M/I homes for $1.53 million, according to a state certificate of real estate value. Mattamy is leaving the Twin Cities during a period of immense shortages for available homes , though permits for homebuilding has spiked in the past year.
