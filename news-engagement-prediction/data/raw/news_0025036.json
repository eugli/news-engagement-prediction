Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) was stopped from speaking Tuesday night for breaking Senate rules by quoting Coretta Scott King in fiery speech opposing the nomination of Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) as U.S. attorney general.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) interrupted Warren’s speech and said she was violating a rarely used rule that forbids impugning fellow senators. The Senate quickly voted, 49-43 on party lines, to rebuke Warren, effectively forbidding her from speaking for the remainder of the debate over Sessions’ nomination, which is expected to wrap up Wednesday night.\n‘Mr. Sessions has used the awesome powers of his office in a shabby attempt to intimidate and frighten elderly black voters.’ Coretta Scott King, 1986 Warren had been quoting a letter that the late widow of Martin Luther King Jr. had written in 1986 in opposition to Sessions’ nomination for a federal judgeship — a nomination that was rejected by the Senate.\nIn 1986, Coretta Scott King wrote to Congress to object Sessions' nomination for US district judge for the Southern District of Alabama. pic.twitter.com/Q22vm52Xmc\n— Women's March (@womensmarch) January 27, 2017 “I am surprised that the words of Coretta Scott King are not suitable for debate in the United States Senate,” Warren said.\nDemocrats were outraged. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) called it “demeaning” and made a motion to allow Warren to continue speaking, which did not pass.\nIt is demeaning to the memory of Coretta Scott King and harmful to the process for the Republicans to silence @SenWarren . #LetLizSpeak\n— Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) February 8, 2017 Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) called Warren’s censure “unreal,” and in a series of tweets questioned how it was even possible to debate the nomination of a sitting senator.\nThat's the key point. Rules against criticizing other Senators cannot apply when you are DEBATING THE NOMINATION OF A SENATOR! https://t.co/mLQqP7z14d\n— Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) February 8, 2017 In a series of tweets Tuesday night, Warren said she “will not be silent about a nominee for AG who has made derogatory & racist comments that have no place in our justice system.”\nI will not be silent about a nominee for AG who has made derogatory & racist comments that have no place in our justice system.\n— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 8, 2017 “She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted,” McConnell said.\nSome noted that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was not sanctioned when he called McConnell “a liar” on the Senate floor in 2015 .\nEarlier Tuesday evening, President Donald Trump blasted Democrats for delaying the confirmations of much of his Cabinet. After three weeks in office, just five of Trump’s 15 nominees have been confirmed.\nIt is a disgrace that my full Cabinet is still not in place, the longest such delay in the history of our country.
