(PTI) If politics is an art of the impossible, then Shiv Sena and Congress coming together seems like a possibility. The possibility of Congress and Shiv Sena might coming together is only an attempt to checkmate BJP in the race for control but is there any convergence in their ideologies?\nWhile the Sena’s ideology is based on the concepts of ‘Bhumiputra’ (Marathi for “Sons of the Soil”) and Hindutva or Hindu nationalism, Congress is a liberal, secular party. Shiv Sena is essentially a regional party that believes that Maharashtrians deserve more rights in Maharashtra than those who are not from Maharashtra. However, in recent times, the Sena has laid more emphasis on Hindutva. Whereas Congress positions itself as a socialist, ‘moderate’, left of center or centrist party.\nHowever, it is reliably learned that Uddhav Thackeray ’s emissaries had approached the Congress with a “proposal” for backing Shiv Sena’s claim for the city Mayor’s post. They said the Congress, which suffered a drubbing in the polls, is considering the option of extending “outside support” to the Shiv Sena. Sources said the Shiv Sena has offered the Deputy Mayor’s post to the Congress in lieu of its support. Maharashtra Congress chief Ashok Chavan convened a meeting of senior party leaders where the Sena’s option is said to have been discussed. Former Chief Ministers Sushilkumar Shinde and Narayan Rane; Mumbai Congress chief Sanjay Nirupam; MP Hussain Dalwai and former Maharashtra ministers Naseem Khan and Balasaheb Thorat attended the meeting. The party will take a call on extending support after receiving a formal proposal from the Shiv Sena.\nYou may also want to watch:\nEven though on the face of it both Shiv Sena and Congress are non-commital, the improbable alliance of them coming together is a possibility. How is Uddhav Thackeray’s mind working is anybody’s guess, but it is the easiest option for BJP and Shiv Sena to bury their difference and form an alliance for the municipality as well and not disturbing the 20 year apple cart too much. It will be good for Shiv Sena and BJP to take a call first.\nIt will be very difficult politically to have an alliance with Congress at municipal level and with BJP at the state-level.\nEven if we justify the move by citing instances when Shiv Sena has broken NDA ranks to extend support to Congress’s nominees Pratibha Patil and Pranab Mukherjee for the President’s post, there is no reason for two most unlikely parties to come together just to keep BJPat bay. Let”s hope , Shiv Sena is only exploring and will take a decision that is good for governing the richest constituency. As it is, Mumbai has big governance issues and a well thought out alliance can help sort those out.\nWhile the BJP camp is yet to formally reach out to Thackeray, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari pushed for an alliance. “The situation is such that both parties (BJP and Sena) have to come together,” Gadkari said adding that a final decision would be taken by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Uddhav Thackeray. “Both of them are mature. They are good friends,” Gadkari told a local TV channel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T18:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T09:20:44.132+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
