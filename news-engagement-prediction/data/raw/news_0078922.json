Instead, it seems the motivation is to raise additional revenue by nudging travelers to pay even more for non-Basic fares. In fact, American Airlines is telling its investors just that in its just-released annual report: \nWe have recently instituted, and intend to institute in the future, changes to our business model to increase revenues and offset costs. These measures include premium economy service, basic economy service and charging separately for services that had previously been included within the price of a ticket and increasing other pre-existing fees. \nNote that there’s no mention of implementing these new services to better compete with low-cost carriers. The focus is entirely on increasing revenues and offsetting costs. \nBottom Line \nWhile airlines are free to set pricing however they feel is best for the company, we want to call out both American and United for generally pricing not even close to the low-cost carriers. If the true reason for implementing Basic Economy is competition, American Airlines and United Airlines need to lower their Basic Economy fares to better match LCC pricing. Otherwise, it’s clear that Basic Economy is just a move to increase prices for the same product as before.
