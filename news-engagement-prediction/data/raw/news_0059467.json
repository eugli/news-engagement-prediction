There's also a committee of three set up to oversee the making of the ornaments. \nIn October last year, KCR presented a golden crown weighing 11.700 kg and worth Rs 3.65 crore to goddess Bhadrakali in Warangal. He had presented a crown and necklace to Lord Venkateswara in Tirumala and a nose stud to goddess Kanaka Durga in Vijayawada.
