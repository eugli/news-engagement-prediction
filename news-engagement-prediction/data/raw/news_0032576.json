Photo: Melissa Phillip, Houston Chronicle Image 20 of 20 First look: Field & Tides in the Heights 1 / 20 Back to Gallery \nChef Travis Lenig began a new chapter in his Houston restaurant career when he took the reins at Liberty Kitchen & Oyster Bar in the Heights six years ago. That restaurant brand blossomed, and Lenig was there through it all as it emerged as one of the city's most popular and reliable dining ceoncepts with multiple locations. \nToday Lenig is no longer with the brand that propelled his career. But he's back in the Heights with his own marquee, his first restaurant only blocks from his original Liberty. \n\"I've come full circle,\" he said sitting in his new baby, Field & Tides , that he owns with his partner, Chico Ramirez, former operations director for the group that owned Liberty and BRC Gastropub. \"The Heights is one of the greatest neighborhoods in Houston by far and we're glad to be here.\" \nFIRST LOOK: Pax Americana chef starts a new project in the Heights \nThe Heights – and all of Houston, for that matter – can return that affection on Monday, Feb. 13, when Field & Tides opens to the public for dinner at 5 p.m. The small, charming restaurant, situated within the snug neighborhood bungalow that used to house Zelko Bistro at 705 E. 11th, is finally ready to show its stuff with a menu that Lenig has described as \"an open canvas.\" \nHe's painting with thoughtful strokes of flavor that mirror the way Houston eats with Asian, Italian, Mexican and Gulf Coast influences coloring his American bistro fare. The menu begins with starters such as oysters with a cane vinegar mignonette; daily crudo; smoked fish dip with crackers; pimento cheese fritters with pepper jelly; crispy fried oysters and Brussels sprouts with a chile honey glaze; and chicken wings with a sticky sambal glaze. \nThere's a fried oyster Caesar salad with chipotle and anchovy dressing; a stack of green tomatoes and jumbo lump crab; roasted beets with goat cheese and spiced Texas pecans; She Crab Soup; a sandwich of cornmeal crusted Gulf fish with cole slaw, pickles and fried egg on a challah bun; a pulled pork sandwich (similarly dressed); and a burger with bacon, cheddar, and IPA Creole mustard. \nLenig's entrees: pan-seared scallop on shrimp and crab risotto; pan-seared Gulf snapper on lemon herb risotto; roasted rack of venison with braised red cabbage and poblano chile mash; pecan-crusted flounder with crab tasso butter; duck confit leg on corn pudding with bacon collard greens and a cane vinegar gastrique; and hanger steak au poivre with bourbon demi glaze and French fries. \nThe place's interior design, overseen by Chico's wife, Wyndy Ramirez of Wynne Design Works, has simple oak tables and whitewashed chairs broken up by padded banquettes. There's a lighting fixture made of fused antlers and hanging bulbs; wine crate paneling; and a bar fronted by decorative wood disks and topped in gleaming copper. The look is smart but not too self-aware. \nAnd somehow the 54-seat dining room is at once airy and intimate. The restaurant's patio offers 24 additional seats, and come spring the adjacent former gas station will open as a separate lounge/bar for wine and cocktails (it also will have a smaller menu if diners choose to eat there). \nThe beer and cocktail menu has been put together by beverage director Monique Hernandez, formerly with Liberty Kitchen River Oaks. The 34-bottle wine list, written by former Brasserie 19 GM and somm Shawn Virene, visits Bordeaux, Burgundy, South America, Australia, and California wine country. There are five reds and five whites by the glass as well as two champagnes. And the cocktail menu offers some appealing players: the Rip Tide (gin, maraschino liqueur, crème de violette); Countercurrent (gin, simple syrup and lemon juice topped with bubbles); and El Vaquero, a mezcal concoction sporting a green Chartreuse mist and a Field & Tide logo stenciled on its foamy egg white top. \nChico Ramirez, who also owns The Boot in the Heights, said he's thrilled to be back together working with Lenig. Lenig, too, is just as enthused to be working with a partner who is also a friend. \nAnd the chef can't wait to start cooking up a new chapter in his career. \n\"I've grown a lot and learned a lot with Liberty Kitchen. I really enjoyed my time with that company and spreading my wings,\" he said. \"In this business you always have to keep learning. There's always a better way of doing something and I learned that just in the time before opening. It's been enlightening and educational.\" \nAnd come Monday, busy no doubt. \nField & Tides , 705 E. 11th, 713-861-6143; fieldandtides.com.
