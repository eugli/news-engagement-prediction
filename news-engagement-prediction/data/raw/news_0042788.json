Spare a kind thought for this former couple whose rocky split is being enthusiastically shared by thousands of people as we speak. \nAn American student has gone viral after he graded his ex-girlfriend’s heartfelt breakup letter and posted it to social media.\nThat’s right. Graded. As in, she wrote a four-page letter about how much he meant to her, and he edited her spelling and grammar like a no-nonsense schoolteacher, paragraph by paragraph, with a savage red pen.\nNick Lutz, 20, posted the “graded” update of the four-page letter to Twitter.\nWhen your ex writes you an apology letter so you grade it to send it back pic.twitter.com/MczdjcCiil \n— Nick Lutz (@NickLutz12) February 17, 2017 He opens by writing in the margin — in his sassy red pen — saying the introduction is too long and there’s a lot of repetition.\nHe goes on to say she needs to explain her reasoning for the break-up and back up her claims with proof.\nAnd of course, he points out all the spelling and grammar errors, underlining certain phrases, putting passive-aggressive question marks over others, and even just writing “What is this?” next to a word.\nHundreds of thousands of people now know the details of Nick’s breakup, but he’s not fussed. Source: Twitter \nThe letter ends with her saying “I love you”, and he even adds a question mark after this phrase.\nBut the most savage part comes right at the end. He bloody grades it. Like, he gives her letter 61/100 and a D minus.\n“Long into short conclusion, strong hypothesis but nothing to back it up,” he writes. “Details are important. If you want to be believed, back it up with proof. You claimed that cheating never occurred, but place blame on yourself then what for?\n“Need to stop contradicting your own story and pick a side. While this gesture is appreciated, I would prefer details over statements. Revision for half-credit will be accepted.”\nSavage. Source: Twitter \nBrutal. Absolutely brutal. But Mr Lutz has an explanation for the stunt.\n“We started dating in February of last year and dated for about eight months,” he explained to the BBC .\n“Four months in she started hiding her phone and I heard she had code names for guys in her contacts list.\n“It came to an end after she told me she was going to a theme park with her best friend who’s a girl but I later found out she went with a dude.\n“I haven’t spoken to her since this happened but I am not planning on talking to her anytime soon.”\nHe said the exercise started out as a joke between him and his friends, but he decided to tweet it on a whim.\nThe post has racked up more than 100,000 retweets and 300,000 favourites on Twitter, suggesting most people are on his side.\nSome are even coming out with grammatical fix-ups of their own.\n@NickLutz12 misspelled that so I say they should get a 58 pic.twitter.com/7r94U7HQnT \n— Rachel Green (@katiemoe_) February 18, 2017 @NickLutz12 there were quite a few missing apostrophes in contractions, if you wanna count off points for that too :( 😂\n— kae. (@TheKaelye) February 18, 2017 @NickLutz12 @fillegrossiere ok should have failed her. You missed that she listed \"a lot\" as one word in her intro.\n— Dr Petty Spaghetti🍝 (@waywardpug) February 18, 2017 The moral of this story is the internet is a savage place when it comes to scorned lovers. Oh, and if you’re going to pen a letter to your ex, be sure to run it by spellcheck first.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:35:37.899+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
