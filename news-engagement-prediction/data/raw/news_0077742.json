Source: \nThe Wanderers on Thursday were fined $20,000 over the sign held aloft by members of the Red and Black Bloc, depicting Arnold engaging in a sex act. \nThe club also banned 14 RBB members, and threatened to shut down its entire area indefinitely. \nOn Saturday - a week after the incident - the Wanderers released a statement of apology. \n\"Unfortunately the events of the last week have overshadowed what we should be celebrating as a fantastic event between Sydney's two A-League teams,\" said Wanderers chairman Paul Lederer. \n\"It is with great disappointment that the actions of a minority have prompted fairly stern action to be taken by the club this week to eradicate anti-social behaviour. \n\"On behalf of the Western Sydney Wanderers, we apologise to Graham Arnold and his family and to all others who have been offended by the abhorrent actions of a few who are now no longer part of our club.\" Offensive banner turns Arnie's daughters off derbies The lewd fan banner depicting Graham Arnold in a sex act has made the Sydney FC coach's daughters reluctant to attend any more A-League Sydney derbies. \nBut the apology appears to have fallen on deaf ears, with Arnold saying on Wednesday that the Wanderers had left it too late to make it up to him. \n\"I would probably have liked one (an apology) by now,\" Arnold said. \n\"I haven't heard from them ... so I don't want one now.\" \nSydney FC chief executive was also angered by the fact no-one from the Wanderers had yet made contact with Arnold personally, taking to social media to say: \"Just spoke to Graham he hasn't heard from anyone at WSW. He isn't on social media. Just call him. Easy as that.\" \nHe later revealed Wanderers chief executive John Tsatsimas had called Arnold on Friday night. Just spoke to Graham he hasn't heard from anyone at WSW. He isn't on social media. Just call him. Easy as that. \n— Tony Pignata (@tpignata9) February 24, 2017 Spoke to @wswanderersfc CEO John Tsatsimas JT called Arnie late yesterday which wasn't answered JT and I go back a long way Time to move on \n— Tony Pignata (@tpignata9) February 24, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T05:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T00:24:07.348+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
