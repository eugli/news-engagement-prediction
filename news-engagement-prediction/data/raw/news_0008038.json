Then, 25 minutes into what was expected to be an hour-long call, Trump abruptly ended it. \nAt one point Trump informed Turnbull that he had spoken with four other world leaders that day - including Russian President Vladimir Putin - and that, “This was the worst call by far.” \nTrump’s behaviour suggests that he is capable of subjecting world leaders, including close allies, to a version of the vitriol he frequently employs against political adversaries and news organisations in speeches and on Twitter. \n“This is the worst deal ever,” Trump fumed as Turnbull attempted to confirm that the United States would honour its pledge to take in 1,250 refugees from an Australian detention centre. Trump, who one day earlier had signed an executive order temporarily barring the admissions of refugees, complained that he was “going to get killed” politically and accused Australia of seeking to export the “next Boston bombers.” \nUS officials said that Trump has behaved similarly in conversations with leaders of other countries, including Mexico. But his treatment of Turnbull was particularly striking because of the tight bond between the United States and Australia - countries that share intelligence, support one another diplomatically and have fought together in wars including in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nThe characterisations provide insight into Trump’s temperament and approach to the diplomatic requirements of his job as the nation’s chief executive, a role in which he continues to employ both the uncompromising negotiating tactics he honed as a real estate developer and the bombastic style he exhibited as a reality television personality. \nThe depictions of Trump’s calls are also at odds with sanitised White House accounts . The official read-out of his conversation with Turnbull, for example, said that the two had “emphasised the enduring strength and closeness of the US-Australia relationship that is critical for peace, stability, and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and globally.” \nTurnbull, said his country’s relationship with the United States remained “very strong” and refused to comment on this report. \nTurnbull also would not say whether Trump had abruptly ended the expected hour-long conversation after 25 minutes as the Australian attempted to steer the conversation to other topics. \n“It’s better that these things — these conversations — are conducted candidly, frankly, privately,” Turnbull told reporters. \nA White House spokesman declined to comment. A senior administration official acknowledged that the conversation with Turnbull had been hostile and charged, but emphasised that most of Trump’s calls with foreign leaders - including the heads of Japan, Germany, France and Russia - have been both productive and pleasant. \nTrump also vented anger and touted his political accomplishments in a tense conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto , officials said. The two have sparred for months over Trump’s vow to force Mexico to pay for construction of a border wall between the two countries, a conflict that prompted Pena Nieto to cancel a planned meeting with Trump. \nTrump told Pena Nieto in last Friday’s call, according to the Associated Press, which said it reviewed a transcript of part of the conversation, “You have a bunch of bad hombres down there. You aren’t doing enough to stop them. I think your military is scared. Our military isn’t, so I just might send them down to take care of it.” \nBut even in conversations marred by hostile exchanges, Trump manages to work in references to his election accomplishments. US officials said that he used his calls with both Turnbull and Peña Nieto to mention his election win or the size of the crowd at his inauguration. \nOne official said that it may be Trump’s way of “speaking about the mandate he has and why he has the backing for decisions he makes.” But Trump is also notoriously thin-skinned and has used platforms including social-media accounts, meetings with lawmakers and even a speech at CIA headquarters to depict his victory as an achievement of historic proportions, rather than a narrow outcome in which his opponent, Hillary Clinton, won the popular vote. \nThe friction with Turnbull reflected Trump’s anger over being bound by an agreement reached by former President Barack Obama’s administration to accept refugees from Australian detention sites even while Trump was issuing an executive order suspending such arrivals from elsewhere in the world. . @POTUS @realDonaldTrump - speaking with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull from the Oval Office. pic.twitter.com/6rDjoygXDD \n— The White House (@WhiteHouse) January 28, 2017 \nThe issue centres on a population of roughly 2,500 people who have sought asylum in Australia but were diverted to facilities off that country’s coast at Nauru and Manus Island in Papua New Guinea. Deplorable conditions at those sites prompted intervention from the United Nations and a pledge from the United States to accept about half of those refugees, provided they passed US security screening. \nMany of the refugees came from Iran, Iraq, Sudan and Somalia, countries now listed in Trump’s order temporarily banning their citizens entry to the United States. A special provision in the Trump order allows for exceptions to honour “a pre-existing international agreement,” a line that was inserted to cover the Australia deal. \nBut US officials said that Trump continued to fume about the arrangement even after signing the order in a ceremony at the Pentagon. \nAustralia didn’t have Trump’s phone number, so his famous golfing buddy helped out \n“I don’t want these people,” Trump said. He repeatedly misstated the number of refugees called for in the agreement as 2,000 rather than 1,250, and told Turnbull that it was “my intention” to honour the agreement, a phrase designed to leave the US president wiggle room to back out of the deal in the future, according to a senior US official. \nTurnbull told Trump that to honour the agreement, the United States would not have to accept all of the refugees but only to allow them each through the normal vetting procedures. At that, Trump vowed to subject each refugee to “extreme vetting,” the senior US official said. \nTrump was also sceptical because he did not see a specific advantage the United States would gain by honouring the deal, officials said. \nTrump diplomacy: how will it affect China? \nTrump’s position appears to reflect the transactional view he takes of relationships, even when it comes to diplomatic ties with long-standing allies. Australia has sent troops to fight alongside U.S. forces for decades and maintains close cooperation with Washington on trade and economic issues. \nAustralia is seen as such a trusted ally that it is one of only four countries that the United States includes in the so-called “Five Eyes” arrangement for cooperation on espionage matters. Members share extensively what their intelligence services gather, and generally refrain from spying on one another. \nThere also is a significant amount of tourism between the two countries. \nTrump made the call to Turnbull about 5pm Saturday from his desk in the Oval Office, where he was joined by chief strategist Stephen Bannon , national security adviser Michael Flynn and White House press secretary Sean Spicer. \nAt one point, Turnbull suggested that the two leaders move on from their impasse over refugees to discuss the conflict in Syria and other pressing foreign issues. But Trump demurred and ended the call, making it far shorter than his conversations with Shinzo Abe of Japan, Angela Merkel of Germany, François Hollande of France or Putin. \nAdditional reporting by Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T10:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T05:49:59.182+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
