FXX; Entertainment Weekly \nA new trailer for the upcoming retro season of \"Archer,\" dubbed \"Archer: Dreamland,\" is here, courtesy of Entertainment Weekly . \nOn the upcoming eighth season – which moves the animated spy comedy to FX's sister channel for comedy, FXX, on April 5 – viewers get a chance to take a breather after (spoiler alert!) Archer was left for dead at the end of season seven. \nAt last year's San Diego Comic-Con , the animated show's creator Adam Reed teased that \"Archer: Dreamland\" would be \"even more of a departure\" than its fifth season, \"Archer: Vice.\" \"Vice\" took the characters away from their agency, which it was revealed wasn't actually government-sanctioned, and into a life a crime. \nFor the eighth season, the story takes place in Archer's mind and in 1947. He will be a private investigator who's looking into the murder of his partner, Woodhouse (who fans will recognize as an homage to Archer's deceased former butler). All the other characters will play new roles in the past period, as well. \nWatch the new \"Archer: Dreamland\" trailer below: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:32:16.929+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
