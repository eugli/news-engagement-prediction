Story continues below \nThe mobile recording studio, called a bandwagon, arrived Tuesday. It is one of five that are rolling out around the province thanks to a $70,000 donation from Variety. \n“It will introduce our students to some really interesting technology and allow them to experiment more with what they can do musically,” explained teacher Norma Jean Gomme. \n“I’ve seen students come alive in music therapy and take risks that I don’t see them necessarily taking in other places. I think it is absolutely an essential part of their program.” \nThe school was able to use a bandwagon temporarily in the past. This time it is staying in the school district permanently. \nThe aim is to eventually expand its use to other schools in the district. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T09:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T05:38:50.198+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
