But in a remarkable intervention, the head of the Eurozone’s bailout fund accused the IMF of getting its analysis wrong. European Stability Mechanism chief Klaus Regling said that the fund’s officers had overlooked ‘fundamental protections’ included in Greece’s bailout package. He said: ‘The solution for Greece lies not in additional debt relief, but in the government implementing reforms so as to avoid delays in the issuing of the next tranche of the ESM loan.’ Despite pledging its support to a third international bailout in 2015, the IMF has yet to officially sanction any funds as part of the £73billion bailout package. Austerity measures in Greece have previously led to protests outside the country's Parliament in Athens, pictured in 2015 The Eurozone wants Greece to deliver a 3.5 percent budget surplus but the IMF believes said its economy was too weak to grow out of the debt crisis. It also wants ruled written into to law that would offer protections if Greece fails to meet its repayments. Such measures are hugely opposed by Greece’s left-wing government, which has already faced a slump in the polls over its brutal austerity measures. EU officials are desperate to agree a deal in the coming weeks that will guarantee the IMF’s involvement, which is seen as a necessity in Berlin, with a crunch meeting of finance ministers scheduled for later this month. A Greek minister last night aimed an extraordinary accusation at officials in Berlin, suggesting they are trying to force Greece out of the Eurozone. George Katrougalos said: ‘Schaeuble has a strategy of a much smaller euro zone. ‘He has suggested Grexit in 2012, in 2015, he is not saying it loud and clear now, but it is clear in our understanding that Mr. Schaeuble’s idea is Grexit.’ He added: ‘It is highly irresponsible not only for the people of Greece but for Europe.’ Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T08:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T03:27:38.129+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
