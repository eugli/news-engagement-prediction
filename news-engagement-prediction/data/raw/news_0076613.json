(Chris Pizzello/Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP) Diversity also took center stage early on at Sunday’s show, with “Moonlight” actor Mahershala Ali, who is African-American, winning Best Supporting Actor — the first award of the night. Viola Davis then followed by winning Best Supporting Actress for \"Fences.\"\nTheir victories were significant, considering that the last two Academy Awards were overshadowed by the #OscarsSoWhite controversy after not a single nonwhite actor or actress was nominated in an acting category.\nIt was a far different plotline this time, with seven actors of color — including a record-setting six African-Americans — earning nominations.\nAlso among them were Denzel Washington of “Fences” and Ruth Negga of “Loving,” who earned highly coveted nods for Best Actor and Best Actress.\nFour films featuring diverse casts — “Moonlight,” “Hidden Figures,” “Fences” and “Lion” — were among the nine movies nominated for Best Picture.\nKimmel addressed this by jokingly thanking Trump for offering some perspective.\n“Remember last year when it seemed like the Oscars were racist?” he quipped.\nEmma Stone's \"La La Land\" led all movies with 14 nominations. (Richard Shotwell/Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP) Red-hot musical “La La Land,” which has dominated awards season, missed out on the first of its record-tying 14 nominations, with the Harry Potter spinoff “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” beating out the Los Angeles-based toe-tapper to win Best Costume Design.\n“La La Land,” which swept all seven categories in which it was nominated at last month’s Golden Globes, was up for much bigger honors, however, including Best Picture.\nStar Emma Stone earned a nomination for Best Actress after winning the equivalent honor at the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild Awards. Among her competitors was Streep for “Florence Foster Jenkins.”\nStone’s lover in the movie, Ryan Gosling, earned a nod for Best Actor, placing him in a loaded field that also included Globes winner Casey Affleck of “Manchester by the Sea,” and Washington, who won the award at the SAGs.\nOther nominations for “La La Land” included Best Original Score, Best Director and Best Song for both “City of Stars” and “Audition (The Fools Who Dream).”\nAnother early winner was “Suicide Squad,” which, despite poor reviews from critics and viewers alike, took home the award for makeup and hairstyling.\n“O.J.: Made in America,” meanwhile, won Best Documentary.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T04:56:32.509+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
