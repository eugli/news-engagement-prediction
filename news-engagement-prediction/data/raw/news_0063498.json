Funded by the National Lottery and supported by Sport England, it is designed to break stereotypes about women and fitness - and inspire them to get active . \nThe campaign broke stereotypes about women and sport, with posters and TV ads featuring regular women sweating, jiggling, huffing an puffing. It reportedly encouraged 2.8 million women and girls to take up an activity. \nAlthough the first phase of the campaign was aimed at those aged 14 to 40, the second includes those in their 50s and 60s. \nIt's no longer just a case of This Girl Can but 'This Gran Can'.

Even though we initially targeted it at 14-40 year olds, a lot of older women got involved anyway , and even though they loved it they wanted to see images of women who looked like themselves doing sport, too. \n\"As much as we don't see images of \"normal\" women doing sport, it's even worse for active older women, who can sometimes feel invisible in the media. So it was really important to us that they were represented.\" \nOne such participant is 67 year-old Catherine Aicken, who took up British Military Fitness classes after seeing training sessions in her local park. Seven and a half years on she hasn't looked back. \n\"I used to walk my dog in the park and see these people running about and jumping up and down. I always wondered what on earth they were doing – because it looked like a lot of fun. I’m a Telegraph reader so a few years ago I saw coupons in the paper for BMF classes and decided to give it a bash. Now I go two to three times a week.\" Catherine stars in the new This Girl Can ad campaign Credit: Sport England \nD ale emphasises that a key aim of the campaign is \"to champion all the physical and mental benefits of being active for the over-40s\" - of which Catherine is living proof. \n\"My blood pressure has stayed nice and low – and not risen with age. The class is blooming hard work but it makes me feel great and keeps me relaxed. For lack of a better phrase it’s all about the ‘me’ time. \" \nAnother goal of the campaign is to shatter the myth that once you've stopped exercising, it's impossible to start again, particularly when you realise it would be beneficial for your health. \n\"Health issues also bring with them a lot of guilt,\" Dale explains, \"women think that it's somehow their fault and that they should be doing more sport to combat it. But once it's become a big emotional package it becomes even more difficult to actually get on and be active. The campaign is committed to breaking all stereotypes surrounding women and exercise \n\"It's great that doctors are now encouraging women to get active as part of their holistic treatment, but we want them to do it for fun, not just because they're told to. Do it because it's fun and the rest of it will fall into place. \nL ike many women, Catherine was nervous about doing more fitness because of past experiences. \"I think I had a mentality that being active wasn’t for me because I didn’t like sports when I was younger.\" \nThis Girl Can hopes to break that barrier by introducing women to activities they may not have previously considered, and that they will actually enjoy. \nCatherine adds, \"It wasn’t until I found BMF that I felt I was doing an activity that really suited me and that I looked forward to. It’s tough and exhausting but at the same time it’s exhilarating and I’m just totally addicted to it.\" This Girl Can shows that age is no barrier to fitness \nT he campaign wants women to remember that being fit does not mean running marathons; it's about making the most of your own abilities. \nAs Catherine says, \"before BMF, it never really occurred to me that being active could involve something where you don’t have to be the most coordinated and you don’t have to be the fastest runner – you can just take things at your own pace.\" \nDale encourages older women not to be afraid of trying something new when getting active. \"We've noticed that one of the barriers to fitness that older people come across is the fear of being a beginner again; because once you get to a certain age you're supposed to know a lot about everything. \n\"You're never too old to be a beginner and it doesn't matter if you're not brilliant at it first time, or the twentieth time. The most important thing is giving it a go and enjoying it.\" The campaign wants viewers to identify with the women on screen and feel empowered to get active \nT he campaign has also worked hard to prevent older women from feeling stereotyped when it comes to fitness; placing them side by side with younger women in advertising and on screen. \nDale says \"the great thing about Catherine's BMF classes is that they're multi-generational, which we wanted older viewers to see. We're not telling them 'here are the silver classes where you can do your old lady exercises.' \n\"I want more women to feel more comfortable and confident being active and to feel like it's somewhere they belong, and it's for them just as much as it's for men or someone who's really sporty. \n\"Hopefully that will give them the confidence to go further and do things in other parts of their lives that they didn't think they could. And they can. \" Follow The Telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T14:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T09:29:19.636+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
