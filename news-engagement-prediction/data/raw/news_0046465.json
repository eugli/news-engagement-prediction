Because it’s an amazing feeling knowing that you’ve saved someone’s life.” \n“I’ve had a young woman, a young man and on older man. Those three times they got emotional and I kept myself together for them, but when they walked away I lost it. \n“I felt proud that I was able to do something that helped others.” Lee's struggle had an impact on viewers (Photo: BBC) Read More Danny Dyer used to sneak pints behind the bar at the Queen Vic while filming EastEnders - and was signed off two years ago \nAt Christmas, ex-soldier and call centre worker Lee was talked down from the top of a car park by a security guard. \nThe debt-ridden son of Queen Vic boss Mick had left a suicide note for his family which simply read: “I’m sorry”. \nThe incredibly powerful scenes have really chimed with fans of the BBC1 hit soap. \nDanny-Boy said: “Every day people ­contact me telling me that my storyline has helped them. I’ve always said if I can use my platform to help people then that’s the best award an actor can receive. \n“It’s an incredible feeling.” Lee with Mick Carter, played by Danny Dyer (Photo: BBC) \nIt has been a turbulent time for characters and actors on the series. This week it was revealed Danny Dyer, 39, who plays Mick, is ­taking a several weeks off to “sort his life out.” \nDyer’s ordeal made Danny-Boy’s final ­emotional farewell to Albert Square on Friday even more poignant. \nViewers saw Lee pack his bags to start a new life in Dover and depart in a black cab, leaving wife Whitney, played by Shona McGarty, in floods of tears. \nBut his real heart-to-heart goodbye was with dad Mick. Fortunately for fans, the door has been left open for the Walford favourite to return. \nLee has been on a rollercoaster since his Christmas ­meltdown, with Whitney briefly hospitalised after a bus crash and, the following month, he shocked viewers by hitting her. Lee with Whitney Dean, played by Shona McGarty (Photo: BBC) \nThe couple’s attempt to ­reconcile ended in more heartache when he walked out on her at a restaurant on Valentine’s Day. \nWhen Whitney returned home, his belongings were gone, there was a note telling her he no longer loved her and his wedding ring was in an envelope. \nDanny-Boy’s own experience in EastEnders, which he joined in 2014 from a front-of-house ­theatre job, has not been all plain sailing. He has been subjected to hate from internet trolls. \nHe said: “People have ­threatened to stab me – I’ve no idea why. It’s very odd. We call them ­keyboard warriors because that’s what they like to do. It’s important to ignore them. \n“I’m not one to worry too much. If they were standing right in front of me that would be another story. I was never prepared for it. The internet is an incredibly scary and unsafe place to be at times.” Danny-Boy says he was bullied as a child (Photo: BBC) \nThere is one kind of trolling that Danny-Boy fears above all else – the prospect of his private parts being plastered all over the internet. He is now scared to use public toilets in case a stranger with a camera phone grabs a ­photograph. \nHe confessed: “I have to keep my wits about me. There used to be a time when people were safe to go about their business. \n“But now you have to be mega careful – everybody has a phone now. I could be going to the toilet and someone takes a photo of me. \n\"Before I know it, it’s ­plastered all over a social media via a fake profile so this person can never be caught and I’m the one suffering.” \nReal-life East ender, Danny-Boy was bullied as a boy growing up in the London borough of Newham. But he thinks social media makes it worse for children today, which is why he spoke out to promote the recent Safer Internet Day. \nHe said: “I was bullied at school in the playground or when I was out and about. When I was home or round my nan’s I was safe. But if I had access to social media then I’d have still experienced it ­everywhere. \n“Kids now face a lot worse than when I was at school. I worry about the younger generation. The Eastenders plot hit a nerve with fans (Photo: BBC) \n“Thankfully, when I was young, we had Walkmans and bikes – it wasn’t about the internet. Now kids are always on their phones. It’s scary there is access to videos you wouldn’t wish anybody to watch.” \nDanny-Boy is pleased Lee is not being killed off so he could return one day, an idea he would be open to in the future. \nHe said: “I loved every minute of the show but I didn’t want to overdo it. I always said I wanted three years and no more. Lee had been put through such a traumatic experience I think it’s only fair the audience see him get better.” \nDanny-Boy is keen to go to Hollywood for a series on ABC or Netflix but would also like to do a period drama here. \nHe said: “I love the TV and film ­industry over here and I think we’ve got a lot to offer. I’d love to do something really British, I’m quite patriotic when it comes to our TV and film industry.” Whitney, Lee and Mick in hospital (Photo: BBC) Whitney and Lee on a date (Photo: BBC) Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T01:24:21.752+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
