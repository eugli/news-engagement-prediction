I didn’t come to the industry to be treated like a piece of meat or to follow the standards of exploitation of women already practiced. I love acting; it’s my profession of choice. I work hard and I’m good at my work. I don’t want to choose the option of ‘put up with it or quit it’,” she said.

It does not mean that just because I lead a glamorous life on screen, that I deserve to be spoken with disrespect. It’s my life, my body and my wish. No man should assume he can get away with disrespecting me,” she wrote. \nShe wants women to be treated equally with men. “Instead of lecturing women on what to wear, how to speak, and how to behave appropriately, how about we stop telling our men to stop thinking with their genitals, and start look women as strong, free, capable and equal human being. Teach the men to be better people. Every parents need to start this at home,” she added. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T00:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:13:53.628+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
