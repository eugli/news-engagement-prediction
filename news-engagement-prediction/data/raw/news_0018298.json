[Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn]\nBig eyes, rouged cheeks, yellow feathers and most importantly, exaggerated facial expressions - this pair of what seems to be chickens looks funny and naughty. But waitâ€¦if you take a closer look, you'll see these birds are actually parrots.\nKnown as the No.1 newly emerging web celebrities of 2017, the Poinko Brothers have been widely used on Chinese social networks at the start of the Year of the Rooster during the Chinese Spring Festival period, as they are mistaken for a pair of chickens by most people.\nAs of Feb 9, the characters were a hot topic, discussed 27.33 million times on the Sina Weibo platform, a Chinese version of Twitter, and won the favor of an overwhelming number of domestic netizens.\n\"They have replaced Kumamon as my new favorites. Every time I post my status to show my current mood, I will attach a picture of them because they can bring more likes from my friends,\" Weibo user Po Xiaohai said online.\nOrigins of the parrot brothers\nAs they are so hugely popular, you might wonder about the origin of the emerging stars.\nActually, they are the newly released mascots by NTT DOCOMO, Japan's largest telecommunications company, to attract customers and promote products.\nThey belong to the Poinko family. The parrot with a long face and three hairs is the elder brother while the one with the round face and one hair is the younger brother.\nThe elder brother loves his younger brother very much and likes to tell many jokes to amuse him. The younger brother loves sweet food and tries to lose weight but always ends in failure.\nThey are the most famous characters, but do not represent the whole Poinko family. Other members include 20,086-year-old Poinko Master, Poinko Sister, who is crazy about love and Poinko Doctor, who has 10 hairs on the head.\nThey were created in December 2015 and were featured in many eye-catching advertisements for the company throughout 2016. In addition, their dancing has gone viral on Japan's internet.\nPrevious Page 1 2 3 4 5 Next Page Previous Page 1 2 3 4 5 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T08:14:47.186+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
