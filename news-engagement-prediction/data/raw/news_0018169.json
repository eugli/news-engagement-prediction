Man on stag do gets eyelids tattooed and now he regrets it \nCouncil officials said that they were there to protect cyclists from motorists, but cyclists say it is actually putting them in more danger. \nOne cyclist said: ‘It’s really weird. We can’t ride along it on the bike, so we’re forced to ride in the way of pedestrians, or otherwise on the road.’ \nAccording to Le Parisien the bumps, which are about four inches high, were installed in December because drivers went onto the cycle path because of a bus stop on the opposite side of the road. \nThey said that a cyclist was hit by a driver who had gone onto the red path. \nValerie Leteignier said: ‘Some cars would not wait for the bus to leave and would pass on the cycle path and the pavement. \n‘My daughter, coming out of our house, found herself face-to-face with a car and has been beeped.’ \nPatrick Foquet, mayor of the suburb, said a new kerb would be put in place in the spring to deter drivers from going onto the cycle path.
