PHOTOS: Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's Sweetest PDA Moments \nThe reality star, 36, retweeted two accounts on Monday, February 6, that suggested the 39-year-old rapper as the performer for next year’s big game, which will take place in Minneapolis, Minnesota. “Never too early. #KanyeForSuperbowl52,” one fan account wrote, along with a collage of pics from West’s performances. Another account simply wrote, “#KanyeforSuperbowl52.” \nThe “Fade” rapper has been keeping a low profile since he canceled all the remaining dates on his Saint Pablo tour and completed a nine-day hospital stay for extreme exhaustion in late November. He is also reportedly skipping the Grammys on Sunday, February 12, despite his eight nominations. \nHowever, West does have several new projects in the works. He recently filmed a music video for his collaboration with Tyga, “Feel Me,” which will feature cameos by Kardashian and Kylie Jenner. The fashion designer is also debuting his Yeezy season 5 collection during New York Fashion Week and working on a kids' clothing line with his wife.
