Labor has said it runs the software at a loss and payments from MPs do not cover costs. \nMagenta Linas paid the WA branch of the ALP amounts totalling $250,000 from 2001 to 2004. \nLabor said that was to reimburse the party for providing a staff member as training and the practice has ceased. \nThe $2500 a year cap on MPs' software entitlements was recently lifted by the Federal Parliament.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T08:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:58:44.682+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
