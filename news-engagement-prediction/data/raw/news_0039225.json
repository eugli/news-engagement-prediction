(Photo: Dick Vitale, Twitter) \nDepending on who you are, these could be seen as highlights, or they could be seen as lowlights. The reviews were mixed on Twitter while Bill Walton and Dick Vitale teamed up to call the Cavaliers vs. Pacers game on ESPN on Wednesday night. I don't see how you can really hate any of this, so we're going with highlights. \nOverall, it was a little crazy - OK, maybe it got really crazy. Here are some of the wackiest moments: 1. Dave Pasch really tried his best to hold everything together \n\"Hi everybody, alongside Hall of Famers Dick Vitale and Bill Walton, I'm Dave Pasch, and yes, this is really happening.\" rpmsports18: Poor Dave ESPN NBA Basketball: Pacers at Cavaliers https://t.co/hdlGAQ7vzL pic.twitter.com/XGFXnRjGtC \nWalton to Pasch at one point: \"We'll give it to - what is your name over there - to take us to commercial again with yet another timeout?\" mattclapp: Poor Pasch lol ESPN NBA Basketball: Pacers at Cavaliers https://t.co/QQjGKwbEZc pic.twitter.com/akHEMVJyJD â€” Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing) February 16, 2017 2. \"Lady Gaga is awesome.

In awe of LeBron \nVitale and Walton called LeBron James' high school game 15 years ago , so this is a special moment for them to be able to do this. They made it clear that James really impressed them with his 31 points, five rebounds and four assists in a Cavs win.

One of him with Walton and Pasch, and the other with Khloe Kardashian with the perfect caption: \"It was a fab time.\" â€” Dick Vitale (@DickieV) February 16, 2017 Read or Share this story: http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/02/bill-walton-dick-vitale-espn-cavaliers-lady-gaga-lebron-pacers-call-espn-bonkers-video-highlights-pasch/ Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T12:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T07:26:34.849+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
