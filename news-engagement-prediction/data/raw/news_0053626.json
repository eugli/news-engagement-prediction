Typically, we do it with beer.” How to tackle a beer festival \nBeer will be served in two-pint steins, staff will all be dressed in traditional Bavarian costume – yes, Lederhosen for men and Dirndl for women – and they promise ‘an authentic eatery experience’, serving up the likes of bratwurst, schnitzel, pretzels, cold meats and cheeses. \nElsewhere, there will be a beer tent with table service for 1,200, also boasting live music and DJs. Tables can be booked in advance. \nOrganisers say the event is family friendly, and there will be German-market style wooden huts selling trinkets, and an activity area with children’s games, including Hau den Lukas, a can knockdown game. Still, if the amusingly boozy video below is anything to go by, it looks as though by the evening, it’s more one just for adults. \nAll open-air areas are free entry.
