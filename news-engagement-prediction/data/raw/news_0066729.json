Ministers have got to put proper policies in place instead of relying on magical thinking.\" \nThe committee previously urged a step change in the way the government tackles environmental issues at Heathrow, but says there is little evidence this has happened. \nThe UK has already breached EU limits in London for the pollutant NO2 for 2017. The committee says a new air quality strategy is urgently needed to ensure that airport expansion does not harm public health. \nThe government has said after Brexit that EU environmental laws will be imported wholesale into the UK, but the MPs say they have seen no guarantees that the government will keep pace with future EU air quality laws. \nThe report calls on the ministers to implement an alert system for nearby residents who are especially vulnerable to short-term exposure to air pollution.

They say the government must show how the slack will be taken up by other sectors of the economy, which are already struggling to meet their own emissions targets. \nThey say measures on noise lack ambition, with no precision on the timing of a night flight ban and little evidence that predictable respite can be achieved. \nThe report was welcomed by John Stewart, the chair of HACAN, the campaign group that opposes Heathrow expansion. \n\"The government and Heathrow Airport have got to up their game big-time if they are to have any chance of getting a third runway,\" he said. \n\"They have got to prove they can deliver on noise, climate and air pollution - not just say they can.\" \nThe report comes just weeks after the government launched a public consultation on a third runway, which ends on 25 May. \nLater this year or early next year MPs are expected to be asked to vote on the runway. \nA Department for Transport spokesman said: \"We take our air quality commitments extremely seriously and have been very clear that the new runway will not get the go-ahead unless air quality requirements can be met. \nThe spokesman said the government has no plans to \"water down\" its ambitions on cutting aviation emissions and remains committed to meeting emission reductions targets under the Climate Change Act.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:08:42.922+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
