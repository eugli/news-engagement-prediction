Her latest victim? Jennifer Lopez. While asking whom she spent Valentine’s Day with, the talk show host showed this famous photo of her with Drake taken last December . “This guy right here? Was it this guy?” Ellen asked. A post shared by champagnepapi (@champagnepapi) on Dec 27, 2016 at 11:38pm PST J. Lo, who did break her silence on their “relationship” on the Grammys red carpet , stuck to her same story. “We did a song together, if that’s what you’re asking,” she said, “We’re just hanging out. He sent me a song that he wanted me to be on. And then I got on the song. I don’t know what he’s going to do with it, but yeah.” Not a totally satisfying response, but Ellen did pry a little more about the rumor that J.Lo likes to date younger men. “Okay, first of all STOP. I don’t date younger men,” she responded, “It’s not like you have to be younger. It’s not about that. I just meet people. And, if I go out with them, I go out with them, and I like them, I like them. If I don’t, I don’t. I just–It’s about the person, you know what I mean? It’s about who they are. It has nothing to do with age.” A post shared by Jennifer Lopez (@jlo) on Dec 11, 2016 at 2:30am PST \nAlong with Drake, J.Lo previously dated Beau Casper Smart, who is 18 years younger. “There’s this thing because I dated Beau and he was younger, and that was the first guy I ever dated who was younger then me,” she said, “But, then I got labeled right away. And then, that was it. It’s about whether or not I’m attracted to them or not. Attracted to their spirit, their soul, their energy, whatever–their body.” Rex Features Watch the full interview below and skip to 3:22 for Ellen’s Drake interrogation–J.Lo’s face says it all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:31:43.445+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
