While Bieber declined to talk to media after the game, Pronger joked about what happened (again) on Thursday. \nPronger, who works for the NHL's Department of Player Safety, joked that he fined himself $5 during a one-man hearing. \nMore from The AP : \nPronger's grin captured in the photo made it seem like he had one of the happiest hits in his hockey career. \n\"I wouldn't go that far,\" Pronger said. \"Certainly getting a lot of mileage out of a photo, that's for sure.\" \nJustin Bieber got crushed. (Photo: AP) \nPronger had jokes when reporters asked him about this on Saturday after the game too. Here's what he said then, per the St. Louis Post-Dispatch : \n\"A player of his caliber, you've got to take away his time and space,\" Pronger told the Post-Dispatch. \"You don't want to have anybody that has those kinds of dance moves to have any space.\" \n\"I gave him a little back massage with my stick, pinned him up against the boards, rubbed his face in the glass and just gave him a little welcome to the NHL,\" Pronger said. \"I wouldn't even call it a hit. Had I hit him, it would have been probably a different picture because he can't weigh more than 120 pounds.\" \nFor the record, according to a site called healthyceleb.com , Bieber is 5-foot-9 and 145.5 pounds. Pronger, on the other hand, is listed at 6-foot-6 and 220 pounds. \nI should also note that Bieber did score during the game, though Cuba Gooding Jr. claimed it took the singer 25 attempts. Cuba Gooding Jr. on Justin Bieber's goal at NHL Celebrity game: \"Yeah, 25 shots later. Thank God, he might've killed himself.\" pic.twitter.com/6OkMjKBg4J â€” Alysha Tsuji (@AlyshaTsuji) January 29, 2017 \nBieber took a lot of shots that day. Hopefully he had fun.
