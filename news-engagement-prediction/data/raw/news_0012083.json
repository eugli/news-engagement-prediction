(Photo by Adam Trafford/AFL Media/Getty Images) ON Friday, footy stepped into the unknown. \nAnd the unknown loved it. \nBy almost any metric you can think of, the opening round of the inaugural AFL Women’s competition was a remarkable success. \nBut what did it tell us about the season to come and the game itself? Here are five things we learned from Round 1. \nBACK TO BACK A BIG CHANCE \nAFTER a 62-year break between flags, the Western Bulldogs may be winning two in less than six months. \nBased on the collective wisdom of the footy world, Saturday night’s clash between the Bulldogs and Fremantle was a Grand Final preview. \nThe Bulldogs’ list is a strong one, bolstered by many of the players who powered them to wins in the exhibition games against Melbourne in 2016, while the Dockers had the benefit of the overwhelming majority of the talent from Western Australia. \nAnd yet the Doggies ran out 32-point winners; yes, they were at home but it sees them as sole premiership favourites according to the bookmakers. \nSportsbet has the Bulldogs at $2.75 to win the flag ahead of the second-most impressive side of the weekend, Carlton at $3.25. \nThe Blues did look tremendously strong against Collingwood with marquee Darcy Vescio outscoring four teams by herself. Adelaide also impressed, however the consensus is that their opponent GWS is the weakest side in the competition — the Crows are therefore third favourites at $6. \nIn a seven-week competition with only two finals spots — first and second will face off in the Grand Final — one round means much, much more than it does in an AFL season. That’s why we’ve seen such a sudden shift in the odds. \nPOWER FORWARDS ARE A MUST \nTHERE was a common trait in Round 1’s winners — powerful star forwards. \nGiven that the four losing sides kicked just one goal each, it’s clear that getting the ball to the players you can really trust in the forward 50 is going to be crucial this season. \nBlue Darcy Vescio’s four goals were pure silk and skill and really stood out in a weekend of scrappy play, while Erin Phillips had six scoring shots and bagged three majors for the Crows in a standout performance. \nDogs skipper Katie Brennan booted two while Lions marquee Sabrina Frederick-Traub only kicked one, but looked threatening in wet conditions at Casey Fields. \nGoalkicking was shaky at times — which is understandable given the nerves involved — but the lack of fluid ball movement meant the teams that won were the ones that took advantage of their few opportunities. \nTeams that weren’t able to do so, like Collingwood who booted 1.5 and saw star forward Moana Hope go goalless, found themselves in trouble. \nTAKE THE UNDER \nTHIS goes in combination with the need for star forwards; those who can actually score are going to be very valuable in this league. \nWith just 15 minutes per quarter scoring was always going to be low, but it is now apparent that a new league means a lower skill level than AFL viewers are used to. \nThat isn’t a bad thing, nor is it a reason for the league not to be supported. The simple fact is these women haven’t had the opportunities or years of training to get to the point that the elite stars of the men’s league have; never mind the lack of footy pathways siphoning off the most talented athletes. \nBut, yes, some teams had trouble scoring this past weekend. That’s going to give an advantage to the truly great players in the competition but it also means there may be more variability in the competition. \nUpsets aren’t rare in footy but they’re difficult because over the length of a match, a truly good team should produce more scoring opportunities and more goals than their opponent does. In AFLW there will be fewer of those opportunities both because the matches are shorter — barely above half the length of an AFL game — and the players aren’t as experienced. \nA raging favourite could just suddenly kick 1.4 compared to their opponent’s 4.1 — as Melbourne did against the Brisbane Lions on Sunday — and lose off the back of a handful of misses. Watch for that happening in upcoming rounds. \nCODE-HOPPERS ARE VERY VALUABLE \nMUCH was made before the season of the women switching sports to join AFLW clubs, partially because they’re great stories. \nBut the other reason is because they’re clearly terrific athletes if they’re able to hop to a new code. We saw the best of those starring in Round 1. \nOn Friday night, former Matildas goalkeeper Brianna Davey was close to best on ground for Carlton. \nShe collected 26 disposals and had 555 metres gained. If a male player had that performance prorated out over four AFL-length quarters, it would have equalled 47 disposals and 1007 metres gained. \nErin Phillips (WNBA) was also tremendous with her three goals for the Crows while Bulldog Emma Kearney (WBBL) had 23 disposals, six more than any other player on the ground. \n“Female athletes are going to go where the opportunity is,” dual Australian international Ellyse Perry told Fox Sports News’ Bill and Boz . \nAnd at this pace, the opportunity is definitely in AFLW. \nBUILD IT AND THEY WILL COME \nTHE 6,500 fans who were willing to make the trek out to Casey Fields on Sunday — a ground that is tough to be a spectator at the best of times — helped AFLW make history. \nThey tipped the Round 1 attendance total over 50,000, a remarkable figure which included a lockout at Ikon Park (more than 24,000 for Carlton v Collingwood) and another five-digit number at Whitten Oval. \nYes, tickets were free, but the TV ratings show there is massive interest in this league. More than 1.22 million people around Australia watched Friday night’s match on both free-to-air and Fox Footy. \nThe metropolitan average viewership on free-to-air was 593,000, easily competing with the average for Friday night AFL games. \nThe response was so strong that the league is considering moving the AFLW Grand Final to the MCG on Saturday March 25 before the much-anticipated Essendon v Hawthorn clash.
