(Joanne Hammond/Republic of Archaeology)\nShe said the signs leave many British Columbians without an accurate sense of the province's history.\n\"Those are the kinds of stories that British Columbians and tourists are being educated on, so we need to seriously think about what the message are in those signs,\" she said.\nHere, Hammond rewrites a Kamloops \"stop of interest\" plaque to better reflect it as the home of the Secwepemc people. (Johanne Hammond/Republic of Archaeology)\nFor the most part, Hammond says she has received mostly positive responses, especially from Indigenous people.\n\"They're meant to be provocative for sure,\" Hammond said, but added that most of the information is from archaeological knowledge, documented history, as well as First Nations testimonies.\n\"I'm using the truth of what happened there. It surprises people because we don't often talk about it.\"\nHammond calls this one of her more provocative signs. (Joanne Hammond/Republic of Archaeology)\nThe Ministry of Transportation's public consultation period for additional \"stop of interest\" signs ended on Jan. 31, 2017. The Ministry has planned to install new signs during late spring and early summer this year.\nWith files from On the Coast", "external_links": ["http://republicofarchaeology.ca/blog/", "https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2016TRAN0281-001800"], "published": "2017-02-14T05:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T13:57:15.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
