We do not wear a hijab and go running in the streets, shame on Nike,” she said. Filmed in the older, rundown suburbs of the glitzy Gulf Arab emirate of Dubai, the ad reflects the struggles faced not only by women across the region but also by some its own stars. \nAmal Mourad, a 24-year old Emirati parkour athlete shown leaping across rooftops, reportedly said her father at first forbade her from training in a gym where men were present. \n“Convincing my father was the toughest part … if you want something bad enough you stick to it, and you can get it done,” said Mourad, who now teaches classes in a mixed gender gym. \nWomen exercising in public is a rare sight in much of the region and women-only gyms are few, are not fully equipped for different sports and are often more expensive than gyms for men. In Saudi Arabia, physical education is prohibited in all-girls public schools and women’s gyms remain illegal in the kingdom because female athleticism is deemed un-Islamic. \nSpeaking to the Okaz newspaper this month, Saudi Princess Reema bint Bandar said the government would soon provide female gyms with licenses, citing public health reasons and not women’s empowerment. \n“It is not my role to convince the society, but my role is limited to opening the doors for our girls to live a healthy lifestyle,” said bint Bandar, who is a senior official at the General Authority of Sports. \nThe ad’s message may also tap into an emerging new market for Arab women chafing at hidebound social norms and an entertainment industry that often relegates them to docile roles. “We need to start driving the conversation away from Arab women being subjects of segregation, or oppression … and more towards them being enablers, achievers and go-getters,” said Dubai advertising executive Nadim Ghassan.
