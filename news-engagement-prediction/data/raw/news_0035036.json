Picture: Michael Ross\nIt’s a head-spinner for Folau because he was born in Sydney’s west, played for the Queensland and Australian Schoolboys rugby league team from Brisbane’s Marsden State High and was selected in league for Queensland.\nAll his rugby union exploits have been as a NSW Waratah since 2013 and he’s never played rugby for a Queensland senior club.\nFolau seemed a little wrong-footed when the Origin Rugby question landing in his lap after the Waratahs were on Sunday the first side eliminated at the Brisbane Global Rugby Tens despite scraping home 14-12 for their first pool win over the Melbourne Rebels.\nHe’s uncertain about whether Rugby Origin is a goer or even his state allegiance.\n“I know the (Origin Rugby) idea is being tossed around,” Folau said.\nmedia_camera Israel Folau runs the ball for the Warratahs on day one of the Global Rugby Tens at Suncorp Stadium.\n“Until it comes to life then I’ll start thinking about it more.\n“I’d probably play for the Waratahs. Obviously, it’s a different code (to my league allegiance) and I’d put the sky blue jersey on.”\nAdded Barker: “We haven’t even started on eligibility rules but he (Folau) told me on the weekend ... Queensland.”\nFormer Wallaby Berrick Barnes left Suncorp Stadium after Japan’s Panasonic Wild Knights bowed out in the quarter-finals with a huge vote of support for an Origin Rugby experiment.\n“We’ve seen with the Tens a lot of people criticised it and I’d say the general consensus was it was pretty damn good,” Barnes said.\n“So, why not give it a crack? We’ve got to explore avenues in rugby and it’s time we start looking at it.\n“We don’t know unless we try.”\nmedia_camera Berrick Barnes supports an Origin Rugby experiment.\nWaratahs assistant coach Nathan Grey was measured with his embrace of Origin Rugby and certainly not to the detriment of the traditional Queensland-NSW battles of the border that have been played for over a century.\n“In terms of highlighting our game, it (Origin Rugby) is another way to show it off just as the Tens have been a very good example,” Grey said.\n“If you start throwing around comparisons with league’s State of Origin and history that’s crazy.\n“You look at the interstate rivalry for the Templeton Cup and the Cup is revered by both states and the players ... that’s our equivalent of Origin.”\nOriginally published as Qld or NSW?
