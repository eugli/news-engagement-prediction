Why do you ask? posted at 10:41 am on February 22, 2017 by Jazz Shaw Share on Facebook 1 1 SHARES \nThe other day we looked at a somewhat amusing story of people illegally crossing the border from the United States into Canada. The numbers remain only a tiny trickle compared to the flow of illegal aliens coming into the United States across our southern border, but the trend should still be worrying for Canadians. Or at least so you would think . This is not a view shared by the country’s prime minister it seems. When pressed by reporters, Justin Trudeau said that he has no intention of stopping people coming into his nation illegally. (Newsweek) \nCanada will continue to accept asylum seekers crossing illegally from the United States but will ensure security measures are taken to keep Canadians safe, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday. \nThe number of would-be refugees crossing into Canada at isolated and unguarded border crossings has increased in recent weeks amid fears U.S. President Donald Trump will crack down on illegal immigrants, and photos of smiling Canadian police greeting the migrants have gone viral. \nOpposition Conservatives want Trudeau’s center-left Liberal government to stem the flow of asylum seekers from the United States because of security fears and a lack of resources to deal with them. \nIt’s amazing that Trudeau manages to maintain the level of support that he does in his country. As we have noted here on many occasions, a nation without borders is really not much of a nation at all. Trudeau is quite happy to speak about those seeking asylum, in many instances individuals who were already in the United States illegally and have no qualms about committing the same crime in Canada because they are frightened of President Trump’s new policies. \nBut what about those who are not simply frightened refugees looking for a better life in the Great White North? We get actual refugees here in the United States as well, but they are tiny in number compared to those who cross over with the intention of breaking the law, at least in terms of immigration laws if not something more serious. Don’t the Canadians worry about that as well? Canada has a generous social welfare system and their people are widely renowned for being “nice.” But just how many new arrivals could our neighbors to the north absorb before the situation becomes problematic? \nJustin Trudeau should be looking to our allies in Europe for some guidance on these matters. They also have had very lax attitudes toward illegal immigration in the past, but in the current era many of them are paying a heavy price for it. America seems to be a far more desirable destination for those looking to illegally change addresses, but if the conditions on the ground here under the new administration become too uncomfortable would Canada become the default second choice? They have a much smaller population than us, so just a few million newcomers with no jobs could quickly put a significant strain on their infrastructure. Canada also enjoys a blissfully low crime rate, so it wouldn’t take too many illegal immigrants with bad intentions to generate a significant spike. \nIf those things come to pass, Trudeau’s recent comments may come back to haunt him. Canadians are, as I said, well known for being nice. But that niceness might wear out as rapidly as the welcome mat if things start going downhill.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:03:46.523+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
