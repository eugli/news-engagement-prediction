(Photo: handout) \nCharlotte claims she may now have to move back to her parents’ house and sell her car to pay off her huge credit card bill. \nThe heartbroken fan told the MEN: “After a horrible year last year all I wanted was to start this year off with a bang and see my idol. Instead I’m now in £1329.41 worth of debt.

You’re also being timed. \n“I thought I had paid £377 for all three tickets. Turns out that was per ticket as well as a large booking fee. \n“It was only later when I realised that I had been charged £1547 on the credit card. I have tried everything to get my money back from Viagogo but they have refused and I feel like I have been misled into buying over priced tickets. I had never heard of Viagogo before and didn’t realise they could do this.” \nCharlotte claims she thought she was buying the tickets directly off Ed Sheeran’s official site. This turned out not to be the case. Read More Do noisy eaters throw you into a rage?
