Max Litchfield and his brother Joe will go head to head this weekend \n“We are both pretty quiet before we swim and Joe certainly doesn't need any tips from me. Once it's all over, we will get out of the pool and be brothers again.” \nAlthough Joe is three years younger than Max, he has also made the swimming world sit up and take notice in recent years. \nHe became the European junior champion last year as well and also won a silver medal in the Commonwealth Youth Games in Samoa in 2015. \nAnd although he would love to stun his big brother in Sheffield, he accepts he has two tough races ahead. \nHe said: “I hope to be able to catch him in a couple of years and I want to be able to compete and beat him sooner rather than later. \n“We always push each other on and chat about swimming – our coaches discuss technique and stuff like that but Max is always giving me help with preparation and competing. \n“It will be fun to be in the same races and we might even be in the next lane to each other – which would make life interesting!” \nThe brothers, sponsored by Australian swimwear company Funky Trunks, may be enemies this weekend but they are united in one goal – they would love to both fly the Team GB flag together. \nMax said: “It would be great to compete at Tokyo with Joe – there is a long way to go before that but he is very talented and has a great future.” \nFunky Trunks is the Australian swimwear brand designed for serious performance without the serious attitude.
