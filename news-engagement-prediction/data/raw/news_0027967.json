By Melanie McManus Monday, February 13, 2017, 9:22 am Subscribe 1/10 Photograph courtesy of Molly McManus and Joe Biederman \nAfter two successful summertime Beer Mile competitions, the Eau Claire (Wisconsin) Hash House Harriers decided to keep the fun going through winter by staging a Snowshoe Beer Mile competition in January 2016, possibly the world’s first such official event. The temperature plunged to a frigid 2 degrees on race day, and the wind chill factor made the air feel much colder.

Nearly two dozen showed up for the inaugural event, held at Eau Claire’s Tower Ridge Recreation Area rather than a track, as is typical of official Beer Miles. “Eau Claire is a beautiful city with many trails,” said Tim McManus, ECH3 founder. “Holding our Beer Mile events out in the woods gives people a chance to enjoy nature, plus it makes our events more unique.” To ensure official times, the out-and-back course was carefully measured beforehand with both a wheel and a GPS watch.

The beers stayed in the coolers until the last second.

Lueders, aka “Beer Mile Jake,” won the first two ECH3 summer Beer Miles and was determined to add a win at the inaugural snowshoe event to his resume.

Despite the coolers and hot packs, most runners ended up opening six or seven bottles or cans in order to chug the required amount of beer. It was an honor system: Many people opened a beer and it started foaming out and then instantly froze, so they’d open another and try to stick their mouth over it to prevent freezing. Some people got just a gulp or two down and then opened another if they couldn’t drink enough. Beer Mile Jake didn’t have as much trouble as the rest of the field with frozen beer and clunky snowshoes; he took an early lead and eventually won in 13:06. 6/10 Photograph courtesy of Molly McManus \nOne experienced contestant dropped out early in the race, his system unable to handle ice-laden suds.

The second annual Snowshoe Beer Mile was held at Eau Claire’s Carson Park on a weepy, warm day with temperatures languishing in the mid-40s. Gone were the previous year’s gaiters, snow pants, and blankets; some contestants arrived in shorts, and one was bare-chested. The loop course ran through snowpack that was deep and slushy and featured three pockets of standing water, guaranteeing wet feet. In an inventive twist, the race included an Open category, where contestants could drink the beverage of their choice, including water. Two racers selected chocolate milk, while a third opted for Diet Coke.

So I just focused on drinking as fast as possible.” Carlson managed an 18:30, shaving 10:10 off his 2016 Snowshoe Beer Mile time of 28:40 (which he ran in regular snowshoes).

Surprisingly, the three competitors who drank non-alcoholic beverages ran more slowly than many of those drinking beer. According to the official Beer Mile website (BeerMile.com), there is no Snowshoe Beer Mile listed in the “Popular Rule Variations” category. ECH3’s McManus hopes to change that in the near future.
