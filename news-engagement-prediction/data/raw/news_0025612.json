Photo: Getty Images One night, not long after President Donald Trump’s inauguration, “I snapped,” Douglas Marshall, a journalist and media consultant in Minneapolis, Minnesota told me. In the wake of Trump’s election, Marshall’s husband, Stuart, had all but turned their once-cozy living room into a makeshift newsroom, spending his nights watching Rachel Maddow and AC360 , simultaneously reading “doomsday projections” online. The pair was plugging in as informed citizens, but also to remain abreast of any potential threat to their marriage: Stuart is Canadian, living in the U.S. thanks to a green card obtained only after the Supreme Court upheld same-sex marriage in 2013 and the longtime couple finally wed. “All of a sudden, I felt like we were in danger,” Marshall recalled. “Would they take away his green card and send him back to Canada?” They had been “crushed” by Trump’s election, he added. “It was like someone died.” But on that fateful post-inauguration night, Marshall reached a breaking point. “Our house had this frenzied, toxic feeling. I was in the kitchen cooking and I could hear Anderson, and then Rachel, and then Trump . . . . and I just couldn't do it anymore.” He turned to his husband and said: “Turn it off. I don’t want to hear that man’s voice during my dinner hour.’” The pair was in the throes of an unscientific, yet debilitating new juggling act: the noble goal of staying politically engaged and socially aware (or “woke”) without losing their minds in the Trump era, a time in which each new day—indeed, each fresh news cycle—brings an onslaught of disturbing, often dystopian-seeming news to the president’s detractors. See: rolling over in the morning, reaching for your phone, and learning that the Dakota Access Pipeline is back on, or popping into Happy Hour, only to be informed by a solemn friend that the travel ban had been enacted. “Every time I get a New York Times alert, I feel nauseous. I go to bed almost every night saying, ‘I'm really scared,’” former Vogue.com editor Jessie Heyman told me. “I feel like I'm watching a political propaganda film executive-produced by Obama on the dangers of voter apathy.” Lisa Finelli, founder of the events and talent booking company Xperience Creative in Boston, is similarly struggling to parse the influx of what she feels is constantly stressful information. “It’s very easy to get overwhelmed and lost in all of the news flying at us,” she lamented. “We're living in a time of instability. To me, Trump exemplifies chaos.” For Lena Dunham, Trump presidency blues even led to weight loss. “Try soul-crushing pain and devastation and hopelessness and you, too, will lose weight,” she recently told Howard Stern. The current, fractured political climate is taking its toll on mental health across the country, according to the American Psychological Association. In states red, blue, and purple in Trump’s America, “our psychologists are saying that their therapy sessions are consumed with people expressing anxieties and stress related to the current state of the nation,” Dr. Vaile Wright, a licensed psychologist and member of APA’s Stress in America team, told Vogue.com. Some people are coming in more frequently for appointments, she says, and certain groups seem particularly affected, including Muslim immigrants reporting high fear and anxiety, people of color, parents, and veterans, some of whom are saying: ‘This isn’t what I risked my life for.’ Staying engaged while also staying sane in the Trump era can feel rooted in a distinct conundrum: Keep tuning in and tweeting, and you may spiral into stress, anxiety, and outrage overload. Unplug from the news (and Twitter and your Nasty Women mass text chain) and risk apathy and ignorance. But the choice, Wright says, is not so clear-cut. “Somehow we’ve told ourselves that taking a break means you’re not being a good citizen,” she says. “In reality, that's a pretty unhelpful message, because burning out is not going to help anybody. It's okay to go get your hair colored. It's okay to watch The Bachelor .” According to Wright, the key is finding a healthy balance between politics and self-care (that handy buzzword for treating yourself kindly). For one, instead of living by the scroll of CNN’s news ticker, Wright suggests a media diet—carving out dedicated blocks of time, like on your commute to and from work—during which news and social media are allowed, and cut-off times when you can switch to nonpolitical shows, or, better yet, “soothing activities” like reading, exercise, meditation, or old-fashioned conversation. (If you’re low on willpower, deleting addictive, triggering apps like Facebook and Twitter from your phone is step two.) “My boyfriend forced me to leave my phone home for an entire day on my birthday and it was the best present he could have given me,” Finelli said. “Connecting with people without distraction is one of the best things we can do for ourselves.” Creating a concrete social-action plan—instead of wading through a sea of angst about the Trump administration online—can also help channel your political passion in a positive way. Wright suggests figuring out the level of involvement that’s right for you, and a work that’s in line with your values. Marshall and his husband are finding peace and purpose at St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral in Minneapolis. “The Sunday after the election, the reverend was in tears as he talked about how we won't stop working together for freedom, equality, and protection for everyone no matter race, sexual orientation, beliefs, or gender identity,” Marshall recalled. “He said, ‘you are all safe here and we will be here for each other.’ It was the first time after the election where Stuart felt hope.” Marshall has since joined the LGBT steering committee, hoping to connect the church with the surrounding community, and Stuart is on the stewardship committee, focused on attracting diverse, new members. Since Marshall’s breakdown, CNN and MSNBC are no longer nightly staples in the couple’s home. Stuart now limits his political shows to a few on Sunday morning—before church.
