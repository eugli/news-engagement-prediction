Ad Feedback \nHe will be replaced at the Warriors by his former Melbourne teammate and Kiwis international Tohu Harris, who has signed a four-year deal at Mt Smart from 2018. \nHoffman has a long relationship with Warriors coach Stephen Kearney having played together at the Storm and admitted the decision took him by surprise. \nBut he said Kearney, who broke the news to Hoffman two weeks ago, handled it in the best possible way. \n\"Steve called me in his office, sat me down and told me straight up - that's all you can ask for. \n\"Steve's a bloke I've known since I was 18 years old, played with and coached by. That's the only way to do these things, straight up and that's exactly what Steve did.\" \nHoffman has been retained in the leadership group and insisted he would have no problems putting his personal disappointment aside to get behind Tuivasa-Sheck. \nAt 23, the Warriors fullback, who makes his return from a serious injury in the trail match against the Storm on Saturday, is young for a skipper \nBut Hoffman believes his youthful exuberance could be exactly what the club needs. \n\"I suppose I told things the way they were at certain times last year,\" he added. \n\"I'm sure Roger's going to be really positive about the way he goes about it. It could be a generational thing, they way he's always bouncing up and around. \n\"We have a young group with a sprinkling of older guys so to have a young captain I think will put us in good stead.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T07:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T03:02:32.991+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
