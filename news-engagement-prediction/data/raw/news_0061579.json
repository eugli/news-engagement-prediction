The sponsor called up her brother and asked him to go and check whether the safe had been missing or not from her residence in Mirdif.\nWhen the brother reached the flat, he discovered that the maid and safe had disappeared and so he reported the same to the police.\nPreliminary interrogations revealed that the Ethiopian was involved in the theft.\nProsecutors accused the maid of robbing cash and valuables from her sponsor. \nThe 26-year-old pleaded not guilty when she appeared before the Dubai Court of First Instance on Thursday.\nProsecutors said the maid and two other suspects, who remain at large, stole the Emirati’s cash and valuable wristwatches.\nAsked by presiding judge Urfan Omar about her statement before prosecutors that two others had carried out the heist, the maid contended that she was beaten by law enforcement officers and coerced to say what she had said. She also alleged before the presiding judge that she was threatened that she would be killed if she did not say what she had been quoted as saying.\n“I am innocent and I want to be cleared of this charge,” the 26-year-old told the court.\n“My maid notified me that the iron safe went missing. Immediately, I called up my brother and told him what had happened … when he went to my residence to check, he did not find the maid and the safe was also missing. He also called up the police and told them what had happened,” the sponsor told the prosecutors.\nThe Ethiopian suspect was quoted as telling prosecutors that she had allowed a man and a woman to enter the residence while she was cleaning.\nShe said she spotted the man walking out quickly from the bedroom, carrying a safe with him.\nA ruling will be heard on March 13.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:58:15.171+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
