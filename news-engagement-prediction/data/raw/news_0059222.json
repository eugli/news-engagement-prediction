Tottenham average 56.8% possession per game in the Premier League this season, putting them just ahead of their north London rivals on 56.4%. There’s not a lot in it, but it would be wrong to paint Spurs as a bunch of scrappy hopefuls and Arsenal as possession kings strolling through their matches. Real Madrid prepare huge bid for Chelsea star after secret talks \nAs the numbers above show, Walker is well ahead of Bellerin on tackles won, aerial duels won and clearances. Neither have had to make too many blocks, but again it is the Tottenham man who is ahead. \nEdging it for Bellerin are his superior stats on interceptions and the fact that he’s committed fewer fouls, but while the 21-year-old has been hyped up as one of the top young players in Europe, these figures suggest he’s still not the finished article. \nWalker has more experience at the top level and is currently at his peak, and it shows. For now, he comfortably beats Bellerin for both attacking and defensive qualities. Availability Bellerin’s potential will be attractive to Barcelona (Picture: Getty) \nBoth are key players for their clubs and will not come cheap, but there could be more to the equation than that. Rumour Mill: our round-up of football gossip, rumours and speculation \nBarca are well known for their attachment to their academy products, and that’ll be a major factor behind their desire to bring Bellerin back to the club as soon as possible. \nThe Spain international has followed in the footsteps of Cesc Fabregas so far in leaving Barcelona for Arsenal as a teenager, so the Catalans may feel they could persuade him to continue along the same career path and return to his first club as an established star. \nBellerin may also be questioning his future as Arsene Wenger’s position at the Emirates looks unclear as the summer approaches, with the youngster previously hailing the Frenchman’s loyalty to him as one of the big reasons he signed a new long-term contract in November . Walker has long been a proven performer at the top level (Picture: Getty) \nStill, the fact remains that, with a contract running until 2023, Bellerin would be a hugely expensive purchase. Walker is also tied down until 2012 at White Hart Lane, so won’t be an easy target either, though Spurs are less certain of being able to guarantee silverware and Champions League football. \nWho should Barcelona go for? It’s not a simple answer, that’s for sure. Priding themselves as being ‘more than a club’, even a transfer is more than just about who’s the better player. \nCurrent stats suggest Walker is more ready-made for their system, but the La Liga giants will be tempted by the younger Bellerin’s potential, as well as the fact that he’s one of their own and would probably find it easier to settle with the move to Catalunya. \nWho would you choose? \nMORE: Santi Cazorla’s injury is NOT the reason Arsenal won’t win the title More ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T07:28:47.262+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
