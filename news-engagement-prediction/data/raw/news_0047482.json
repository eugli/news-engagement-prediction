But that could be about to change when Kim reaches a startling conclusion – is it the right one, though? \nAfter Denise lets slip to Kim that the father now knows his link to the baby, Kim desperately pushes her for more information. However they are interrupted when Patrick, Shirley and Carmel turn up to throw Denise a surprise lunch to cheer her up after trouble she has with the area manager at work. \nKim isn’t giving up though and when Shirley and Denise gets drunk, Kim watches closely and realises Shirley knows who the father is and she implies that he is local. (Picture: BBC) \nAfter everyone leaves, Kim continues to pester Denise until she snaps but the next night, during Ian Beale’s birthday party, Kim talks with Carmel over the identity of the baby’s dad and everything seems to slip into place. (Picture: BBC) \nAs Kim reaches a shocking conclusion, has she discovered the truth about Phil or will her suspicions fall elsewhere? \nOne to watch: Friday 3rd March at 8pm on BBC One.
