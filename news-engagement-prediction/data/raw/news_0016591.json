The outcome was the worst offensive game Kentucky's had all season and the first time the Wildcats haven't hit 70 points in a game in 2016-17. \nIt was also the widest margin of defeat for Kentucky as a top-10-ranked team since 1992. Malik Monk , UK's most needed scorer, had just 11 points. Kentucky was 33 percent from 3-point range, 38 percent from the field and 61 percent from the foul line. \nKentucky would be on a four-game losing streak, remember, if Monk hadn't hit a late shot at home against Georgia on Tuesday, putting the game into OT. \nMore to come on this story and this team shortly.
