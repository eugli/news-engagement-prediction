It amounts to intellectual vandalism. \n“ Universities are about free speech and testing beliefs against the evidence. It is good that the vice-chancellor of Sussex has acted straight away to underline the need to show respect for a range of ideas and opinions. ” Jo Cox was working on report into right-wing extremism before attack https://t.co/VjjRMcrhwP pic.twitter.com/I5hu9lO5qL — RT UK (@RTUKnews) June 20, 2016 \nAuthor and journalist Tom Slater, who co-edits the online magazine Spiked, accused British universities of becoming “ intolerant of dissent .” \n“ The Sussex poster was like a Freudian slip, ” he told the Times. \n“ Though the university now claims the event was actually about tackling extreme views, the conflation, unwitting or not, was telling. Universities have become increasingly intolerant of dissent, and even right-of-centre views are seen on a sliding scale of bigotry .” \nSpiked magazine itself has consistently positioned itself in defense of free speech, even when the speaker is espousing extreme far-right or fascist ideas. \nThe University of Sussex said: “ The wording used on this poster did not reflect the aims of the discussion organized by the small number of staff involved, who have recognised this. The event was aimed at talking about what role teaching staff should have in challenging extreme attitudes, such as racist or homophobic comments, on campus. Racism and homophobia exist across the political spectrum and there should be no elision between right-wing politics and extremism. ”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:48:08.209+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
