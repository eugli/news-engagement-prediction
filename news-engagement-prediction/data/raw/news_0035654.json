Still he hopes that as viewers look at his works, with their subtext of hiding behind facades or experiencing violence, they will take a moment to reflect. \n“The intention is to get people a little pensive or philosophical just for a moment, to let people think about all our struggles,” he says. \nBurke is convinced emphasizing similarities over differences will open people’s minds. \n“It was a wonderful journey on my part,” he says. “I hope it’s a journey other people will take.” Nude Nite What: Art exhibition focused on the human form.
