When Donald Trump was elected, says the dual citizen of the United States and Mexico, \"my people in the kitchen were losing their minds; they were like, 'What's going to happen with us?' Now, it's full-blown fear of what could happen.\" \nWhether in the form of restrictions in immigration from Muslim-majority countries, the construction of a wall between the U.S. and Mexico, or an increase in deportations, the new administration's immigration policies and positions are having a chilling effect.

Both men, naturalized citizens who immigrated from Lebanon, say they would not have done so in the current climate. (Rose Baca/Staff Photographer) \nThe subject is one of great concern to Dallas restaurateurs and chefs — whether immigrants or natural-born citizens — who tell a story of an industry racked with uncertainty and anxiety. \nMarc Mansour, a Lebanese immigrant who recently debuted Zatar Lebanese Tapas and Bar in Deep Ellum, agrees. \"It does scare us, as a business — at least, it scares me. It's kind of intimidating when he put the ban on the seven countries. Is he going to ban Lebanon soon? Are the extremists going to come out and torch the place? It shakes you in your boots when this starts happening.\" \nIt is not only chefs, owners, managers and servers who could be affected by tightened immigration policies, but also legions of line cooks and dishwashers, many of whom are unauthorized immigrants. \"As far as the kitchen goes, I would say 80 percent easily,\" says Anastacia Quiñones, chef at Oddfellows in Oak Cliff. \"That's a scary thing to admit because I don't want to get anyone in trouble. I've seen raids happen in California and in San Antonio, and it can wipe out an entire restaurant.\" Abraham Salum serves up a dish at Komali in 2015. He sold the Mexican restaurant in 2016. (File Photo/Staff) \nThe percentage of unauthorized immigrant workers in Dallas restaurant kitchens isn't easy to pin down; Salum suggests it is \"30 to 40 percent, or even higher.\" \nIn any case, Texas is home to nearly 1.8 million unauthorized immigrants, or 43 percent of the state's foreign-born population, according to a 2013 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. \n\"If you look at the back of the house of every restaurant in Dallas,\" says Oddfellows owner Amy Cowan, \"it's almost all immigrant or first-generation labor. Whether it be a Muslim ban or picking on Mexico, everyone's drawing parallels to anti-immigration policies and this stance that the immigration ban seems to be pointing to.\" \nShe and Quiñones organized efforts last weekend to bring box lunches to DFW International Airport to feed the families and supporters of immigrants detained by the temporary travel ban.

(Louis DeLuca/Staff Photographer) \nFernando Echeverria, a barista Cowan employs at Oddfellows, is documented, according to Cowan; his family was resettled here three years ago on a refugee program after experiencing violent trauma in Mexico. Yet he is reluctant to travel now, even within the U.S. \"He wanted to take his wife to Hawaii for her birthday, and now he's afraid,\" explains Cowan. \"He doesn't want to go through an airport, subject to that kind of scrutiny. He has all the legal paperwork that he needs to be here and hold a job here, so for him to be afraid to travel is really something.\" A struggling industry \nThere are other costs besides the humanitarian consequences. Immigration restrictions and deportations could have deleterious financial and workforce effects on a restaurant industry that is already struggling with a tight labor pool, rising labor costs and escalating rents. Tim Byres at the Theodore restaurant in 2016. (Louis DeLuca/Staff Photographer) \nImmigrants from Mexico, says chef Tim Byres, whose Turn the Tables Hospitality owns Smoke, Bolsa and other establishments, are a \"huge amount of our workforce. It's already hard enough to find good people to work in a city with a lot of restaurants.\" \nPart of the reason for the concern, he explains, is that restaurants operate on such small margins. \"We deal with a lot of perishables and a lot of employees, and you've got to make it work in order for it to work as a business.\" \nPressure on an already-stressed labor force may play out in restaurant kitchens in ways that confound not just the restaurateurs who hire immigrants, the chefs who work with them and all the families involved, but also diners who may taste the effects. When skilled help is hard to come by, cooking may suffer. An agricultural worker in Michoacan, Mexico, packs avocados into crates. Mexico is the largest supplier of fresh avocados to the U.S. The fruit is not currently not subject to import duties. (Agence France-Presse) \nAgriculture is another factor, both in terms of agricultural workers in the U.S. who might be affected, and ingredients from Mexico that could become prohibitively expensive in case of a tax imposed to pay for a border wall. \"If this were to affect Mexico,\" says Quiñones, \"it would absolutely ruin our industry. We're talking about tequila; we're talking about fruits and vegetables; we're talking about the majority of employees that work in every Dallas kitchen. It would just crush our industry.\" White House floats tax on Mexican imports that would force Americans to pay for wall \nMexico is the largest supplier of fresh and frozen fruit to the United States, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics. It accounts for more than 30 percent of the volume and more than 30 percent of the value of fresh and frozen fruit imports (excluding bananas).

(Louis DeLuca/Staff Photographer) Innovation at risk \nBut the possible effects of restrictions in immigration on the Dallas dining scene go beyond staffing, financial and humanitarian concerns. Subtract or significantly reduce immigrant culture and we could well be left with a scene that is considerably less vibrant — especially as a taste for global cuisine is on the rise across the country, and some of the most compelling cooking in Texas at the moment happens to be imported from or inspired by other cultures. \nTake Zatar, one of the most interesting restaurants to debut in Dallas in the past year. Owners Mansour and Chaouki \"C.K.\" Khoury both say they would not have immigrated to the U.S. had they known about the immigration policies and xenophobic climate to come. \n\"If you want Dallas to be on the gastronomic scene as a strong contender, you want to be able to bring in people from outside,\" says Khoury, who adds that part of their grand business plan has been to bring in two pastry chefs, one Lebanese and one French, and open a Lebanese-French bakery. \"But if the chef happens to be Lebanese and there's a ban, that could be a problem.\" \nAnd it's a problem that could have broader implications. \"An entrepreneur who wants to invest in bringing new flavors to Dallas\" may be discouraged from immigrating, Khoury says. \"Will these people even want to come to this part of the world? Or would they rather invest over the border to the north or the south, where they don't have that concern?\" Chef Hugo Ortega, at Hugo's in 2014, debuted his fifth restaurant last month in Houston. (H Town Restaurant Group) \nIf Hugo Ortega hadn't immigrated to the U.S. from Mexico City in the early '80s, Texas would not have one of its most exciting new restaurants, Xochi. A celebrated chef and five-time James Beard Award nominee, Ortega debuted his fifth restaurant, inspired by the cooking of Oaxaca, last month in Houston. \nAs he presented an array of modern Mexican dishes at his splashy establishment a few days after it opened, he recounted the story of his success. After entering the U.S. illegally and finding work for meager pay as a dishwasher, he worked his way up to busboy and then line cook, and applied for amnesty under then-President Ronald Reagan's amnesty program. Eventually, he became a citizen, attended culinary school, became a chef and later executive chef at Backstreet Cafe, where he met his wife, Tracy Vaught, who owned Backstreet. Last year, the couple became co-owners of Origen, a highly acclaimed restaurant in Oaxaca. \nWhen asked about how Trump's immigration policies might affect his business, Ortega was much less talkative; his answer came in the form of a careful statement from his wife, through their publicist: \"We just have to wait and see what happens and react from here,\" it read. \"For the time being it is business as usual.\" What's wrong with the Dallas dining scene -- and can it be fixed?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T01:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:35:33.695+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
