(Photo: Courtesy of Patients for Affordable Drugs) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWASHINGTON — A new patient advocacy group launches Wednesday that distinguishes itself by focusing only on drug prices and eschewing money from the pharmaceutical industry at a time when drug makers are pouring millions into a campaign fighting efforts to regulate them. \nThe formation of Patients for Affordable Drugs (PFAD) comes as local officials and members of Congress are decrying the latest huge drug price hikes, this time by drugmaker Kaléo for its version of the overdose antidote naloxone. \nA patient group fighting high drug prices might not seem so unusual unless you've experienced the issue professionally and personally, as PFAD founder David Mitchell has. He was diagnosed with the incurable blood cancer, multiple myeloma, six years ago and has consulted for Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center's Center for Health Policy and Outcomes and the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, which evaluates the value of drugs. \nFor five years, Mitchell was on Revlimid, which is the most expensive drug for Medicare patients with median annual out of pocket costs of $11,500, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. His insurance with his former employer covered all but $3,000 of the annual cost, but he notes the average median annual income of Medicare patients is $24,150. \n\"Patient groups do a lot of good, important things, like patient education and patient support, but they’re not serving patients' interests by ignoring drug prices,\" said Mitchell. \nNicole and David Mitchell co-founded Patients for Affordable Drugs.

Tuesday, more than 70 Democratic House members wrote a letter to Kaléo demanding a 600% increase in the price of its Evzio opioid antidote. The request closely mirrored a letter sent earlier this month by 31 Senate Democrats. \n“As members of Congress who have seen firsthand the toll the opioid epidemic has taken on our communities, we cannot sit idly by while life-saving naloxone is priced beyond reach of those that need it,” the letter stated . \nLast year, lawmakers in Congress investigated several instances of skyrocketing drug prices, including over Turing Pharmaceuticals' Daraprim and Mylan's EpiPen. \nKaléo, which makes an injector device to deliver naloxone, increased the list price from $690 in 2014 to more than $4,000 today. \nSen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri, the top Democrat on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, signed the Senate letter to Kaléo and says she plans to use her committee role to probe drug price spikes. \n“High drug prices and sudden price spikes have hurt Missouri families — some of whom are forced to choose between life-saving medicine and paying their bills,” McCaskill said in a statement. \nBaltimore health commissioner Leana Wen, an emergency physician who has crusaded for increased access to naloxone, said Kaléo has donated about 20,000 doses of Evzio to the city to help save the lives of addicts. But she said that charity “is not a long -term solution.” \nThe generic form of naloxone has also increased, and Wen says she hasn't gotten answers about price hikes from the drug's manufacturers. \nSen.

Critics say these programs shift the cost to others with commercial insurance. \nKaléo CEO Spencer Williamson said in a statement that the company has donated 200,000 naloxone auto-injectors to public health departments, first responders and non-profits and plans to donate about 100,000 more this year. \nWilliamson told the Detroit Free Press the listed wholesale price for distributors selling to pharmacies is $4,100 but it is \"not a true net price to anyone, including the distributors or pharmacies, due to numerous discounts and rebates that are negotiated in the supply chain that make up our health care system.\" \nUnlike with Turing or Mylan, the senators’ objectives are now supported by groups that actually represent the people most affected by the increases. \nWilliamson's explanation \"is exactly why we need transparency in the drug pricing system,\" says Mitchell. \n\"They tell us the published price isn't the actual price,\" he says. \"But they won't tell us the actual price, so how can we make decisions on policy and purchasing?\" \nAlong with greater transparency, Mitchell's group wants Medicare to be able to negotiate lower costs for patients, something both Hillary Clinton and President Trump supported during the presidential campaign. It also favors setting prices based on the value drugs deliver to patients and speeding generic drug approval. \nRead more:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T12:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T07:14:51.993+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
