Audio: Hear the full investigation (Background Briefing) \n\"It's a very much do-it-yourself model in Australia in terms of finding a surrogate and managing the journey,\" he said. \n\"There's lots of hush-hush around finding a surrogate. It's a really tough thing to manage and pull all the pieces together for a couple who just wants to have a family.\" \nCouples often look for surrogates online, on websites that resemble online dating services. \nBackground Briefing spoke to several women who advertise as surrogates and said they had been offered money \"on the sly\". One surrogate said she was offered close to $30,000. Angie and Jason's story \nAngie and Jason had been married for two years when Angie was diagnosed with breast cancer. She responded well to treatment, but the medication left her unable to carry a baby. \nThe couple were desperate to have a family, and began searching for a surrogate online. \n\"It was tricky because it was something that we'd never done before, never embarked on before,\" said Angie. \n\"How do you choose someone from a website?\" Photo: Couples often find surrogates through online dating-style websites. (Pixabay.com, CC-0) \nEventually Angie and Jason settled on a woman, Karen, whose name has been changed for legal reasons, to be their surrogate. After dozens of emails, they met face-to-face. \n\"We may not have clicked in a friendship sense but I certainly appreciated her for what she had done,\" Angie said. \n\"I just think: what a wonderful thing to even offer without knowing me.\" Breaking the law \nHowever, it wasn't long before the subject of money came up and things became awkward. \n\"We're very generous people,\" said Angie. \"For someone that is willing to do something so special for us, we would be happy to give them anything. \n\"What I found uncomfortable was that the husband actually went to my husband and asked for money.\" \nKaren did not deny this claim, but told Background Briefing she chose to leave the financial transactions to her husband. \nWhen Karen's husband started asking for money, Angie and Jason didn't say no. \n\"At this time he took over our financial life, and that was it.\" \nKaren said she felt uncomfortable about the legality of the transaction and she knew that it was illegal in Australia, which was why she told her husband not to involve her. \nBut her motivation was always altruistic, she said, and Angie agrees that the offer was genuine and heartfelt. \nAngie's husband is a surgeon, and Karen said that she and her husband felt he could afford what they had asked for. \n\"We were doing this for them because they couldn't have kids, so this was something that they could do for us,\" she said. Calls for legal reform \nThere have been no prosecutions under Australian surrogacy laws in the last 10 years, but it's clear they are being flouted. \nThe reasons are complex and raise deep ethical questions for all parties. \nBut now that India, Cambodia and Thailand have closed shop, Surrogacy advocates like Sam Everingham say it's time for the government to change the rules when it comes to surrogacy . \n\"Many of the surrogate relationships go bad in the first few months or later in an arrangement,\" he said. \n\"Everybody's left to their own devices when it comes to what is or isn't reimbursed, and what is or isn't done in terms of using a surrogate's eggs, or using the mother's eggs. \n\"It becomes quite tough for people to negotiate this when there aren't professionals to help them along the way.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T05:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:08:21.112+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
