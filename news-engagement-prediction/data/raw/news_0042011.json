State-owned Sonali Bank sold a dollar for Tk 82.95 while foreign bank, the HSBC at Tk 83.50. \nBangladesh's stock markets, which experienced a bearish trend for almost six straight years following the 2010 crash, started to rebound in late last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T19:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T11:57:23.379+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
