It’s led us to disrupt everything that was comfortable and familiar to us a short year ago. If there’s one thing we’ve learned in making it it’s this – being yourself matters. It matters even when not everyone agrees that you should be or understands why it’s important that you are.” — The Band Perry (@thebandperry) February 3, 2017 \n\"Stay in the Dark\"is the band’s first release after an eventful year which saw the Grammy-winning country sibling act part ways with Big Machine Label Group’s Republic Nashville imprint and sign with Universal Music Group. \nMy Bad Imagination will be the group’s third album following their self-titled 2010 debut (No. 4 peak on the Billboard 200) and 2013’s Pioneer (No. 2 peak). \nDownload the new track here or stream it below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T12:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T08:18:54.400+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
