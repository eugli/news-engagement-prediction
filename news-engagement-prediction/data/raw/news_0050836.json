It culminated today is an announcement from Yiannopoulos, himself, stating that he is resigning from Breitbart News. \n“It would be wrong to allow my poor choice of words to detract from my colleagues’ important reporting, so today I am resigning from Breitbart, effectively immediately. This decision is mine alone,” he wrote in a statement. \nJust last week, in an appearance on Bill Maher that was preceded by controversy, Yiannopoulos referred to himself as a “virtuous troll,” appearing to bask in his ability to bait audiences with his outrageous statements, telling the crowd who booed his comments regarding the work ethic of gay people, “I’m just kidding. You’re easy. You’re very easy. Very easily triggered. It’s pathetic.” Like some sort of digital-age Icarus, Yiannopoulos finally reached the topic that could burn down what he had built, at least for now.
