Apart from her, women who founded Gulabi Gang and Belan Gang are also contesting from Bundelkhand. IndiaToday.in | Written by: Mohak Gupta A + A - IndiaToday \nUttar Pradesh Assembly election of 2017 is believed to have about 1,200 contestants belonging to three prominent political parties. About 100 tickets have been given to women by the three parties here. \nAmid the hustle and bustle of the forthcoming election, Bundelkhand is making headlines for its women contenders. \nThe region has given strong women contenders belonging to progressive groups like Naging Gang, Gulabi Gang and Belan Gang. \nSHEELU NISHAD: FOUNDER OF NAGIN GANG \n\nThe 17-year-old Dalit girl hailing from Banda in the Budelkhand region in Uttar Pradesh, was raped by an ex-Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLA, Puroshottam Nath Dwivedi, in 2011. Sheelu having a Congress ticket, is contesting from the same area which was Dwivedi's bastion before he was sentenced for 10 years for rape. \nSheelu, who was battered by the traumatising incident, vowed to fight injustice and formed a rebel group for women known as Nagin Gang. \n\nSAMPAT PAL DEVI: FOUNDER OF GULABI GANG \n\nWearing pink sarees and wielding lathis, this group fights against domestic violence on women. The group was founded by Sampat Pal, who chose to empower women in the far hung villages of Bundelkhand. \nPal is contesting the election on a Congress ticket this time. She contested elections in the past too. \n\nPUSHPA GOSWAMI: FOUNDER OF BELAN GANG \n\nIn a bid to kick-start her political career, she might get a BJP ticket as the party has been planning to keep her by their side for its campaigning in Banda. \nHowever, it is speculated that she might contest the election this time. It should not come as a surprise if she is limited to the campaigning part of it. \nThe chain of events has given women impetus to take on various atrocities against women. Incidentally, BJP has become the only party to give maximum number of nomination to women with 43 tickets.
