Well consider it solved as Chuck is the only one who remembers the future. deneb1973 says: Feb 6, 2017 9:17 PM \nIf the memorabilia crosses state lines or is part of an organized criminal enterprise it can be an issue for the FBI under RICO. Sounds funny but if the jersey is not returned the theft may ultimately implicate the stadium and NFL security giving Brady a cause of action against the NFL. cadreamer1969 says: Feb 6, 2017 9:17 PM \nSome scumbag fake media type lifted his jersey at the last Superbowl they one also.

Congrats 2. Brady is the best (I loathe those arguments & only engaged in them to troll the Patriots fans, but can‚Äôt honestly call anyone better) 3. Changing my screen name since, well, my team didn‚Äôt win a super bowl this year 4. Glad I‚Äôm not a Falcons fan, yikes! I‚Äôd rather lose like 48 than blow a ‚Äúsure thing‚Äù 5. Hoping the Broncos get decent QB play so someone can actually challenge the Patriots next year 6. Shout out to the 3 patriots fans who actually posted WHILE they were getting stomped. \nAdmission: I never really believed that deflategate stuff, just liked trolling the more arrogant among you. Goodell is a punk. \nFinally, to the guy who posted that crap about Brady‚Äôs mom. You suck. You‚Äôre the lowest of the low.

Put a jersey on him, put him in a sauna, and rub some field paint on the jersey. Then put it in the HOF. No one will care that it‚Äôs not the original.
