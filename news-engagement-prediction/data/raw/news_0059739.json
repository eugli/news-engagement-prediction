Either way, he always responds with a thumbs up. \nThe recently-retired Livingston County resident arrives at his spot, along U.S. 23 on the trail near the Green Oak Township Police Department, most weekday mornings and evenings, he said, because he \"had to do something.\" \n“I’m discouraged and disappointed with what’s going on with our president and our country,” said Palmer, 59. \"I can’t travel to Washington. I can’t even get to Lansing too often, but I can do this.” \nRelated: Immigration is our wake-up call \nBut Green Oak officials say both the township offices and the police department were flooded with complaints when an individual showed up at the same spot to support President Trump and seemed to cause a ruckus. The township, as a result, may consider an ordinance to prohibit politicking on municipal property. \nFor Palmer, the idea of a one-man protest was born as he drew inspiration from the Women's March in Washington, D.C. – hence the so-called “pussy hat” he wears – as well as the airport protests following the President Trump's executive order on immigration. It is, he said, the first time he’s ever staged or participated in a protest, and he knows, in Livingston County, where nearly 67% of voters cast ballots for Trump, he's in the minority. \nTom Palmer opted to skip larger protests against President Trump and speak out with a sign he modifies each day with a different slogan. He's surprised by support from passers-by honking in support, particularly truckers, in a predominantly Republican county.

Ted) Cruz or any of those other Republican candidates had been elected; something is wrong with Mr. Trump. Crazy is the new normal.” \nOn one side of his homemade sign, Palmer's message stays consistent: “Dump Chump Trump.” \nThe words, he said, are based on a blues song by Little Charlie & the Nightcats titled ‘ Dump that Chump .’ \n“It’s a great song, and easy to sing along ‘dump that Trump,’’ he said. “In fact, I kind of sing it to myself out there sometimes.” \nThe other side of his sign changes every day. Rather than “Commander-in-Chief,” Palmer’s sign has read, for example liar-, bigot-, denier-, campaigner- or deceiver- in-chief. \nStill, Palmer contends he’s not a name-caller, but rather made a conscious decision to behave the way he sees the president behaving. \n“I’m dishing out what he’s dishing out; some of his own medicine,” Palmer said, noting passers-by sometimes dish it right back by shouting what he characterizes as “discouraging” statements as they pass with traffic. \nWhile he can't always hear the exact words, Palmer picks up on the sentiment, and doesn’t mind if people are unhappy with his message. \n“Some people are enthusiastic and give me the thumbs up,” he said, adding others have stopped to talk, offer coffee or join him for a time. “If somebody wants to be a little negative, fine. I see a lot of negative in what the president is doing. They are mad and angry at me; I am mad and angry at our president.” \nIt is, he believes, his right to protest. \n\"It is a right we are guaranteed – at least for now,\" he said. 'My phone blew up' \nGreen Oak Township Supervisor Mark St. Charles said the township is remaining neutral on Palmer’s protest, as long as it does not interfere with traffic and continues to take place on public property. \n“We are taking no position for or against (Palmer) or anybody else who is out there,” St. Charles said. “It is free speech, and the United States Supreme Court has put forth some stringent rulings on free speech, especially political free speech.” \nBut, he added, after a recent deluge of complaints were lodged when an individual with opposing views arrived and parked a large vehicle in the police department lot, he has asked the township’s legal counsel to look into language for a potential ordinance to “prohibit politicking” on township property. \nThe individual was Rob Cortis, behind the wheel of his Trump Unity Bridge. \n“My phone blew up and police phones blew up,” St. Charles said. “The bulk of the complaints were not with (Palmer's) sign, it was the guy who brought the bridge and the sky lift supporting (President Trump), and brought the bucket up in the air; he was right on the edge of the road right of way at our police station.\" \nSt. Charles said he didn't know whether the township could, or ultimately would, pass an ordinance. \n\"I have mixed feelings,\" he said. \"There’s a lot of things in life I cherish, and one of those things is free speech. That was guaranteed to us by our founding fathers and that should be paramount. Everybody has the right to free speech in this country.\" \nCortis, a Livonia resident who has made numerous appearances across Michigan and other states with his Trump Unity Bridge, said he showed up at the location of Palmer's protest on one occasion, because an unnamed person asked him to do so. \n\"Our mission is to unite America person to person, town to town, coast to coast, so we can all be stronger together as one nation,\" Cortis said, noting he did not feel Palmer was sending a clear message about what he wanted his protest to accomplish. \"I'm trying to help spread the word of unity so people understand the messages the way Donald Trump would like them to be understood.\" \nCortis added he plans to bring his Unity Bridge to other Livingston County locations in the near future. 5 CONNECT 29 COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:20:27.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
