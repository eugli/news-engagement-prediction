LOUIS • A controversial series of recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests netted 13 men in and around the agency’s St. Louis suboffice, a spokeswoman said Friday. \nThe “enforcement operations” were launched last week, and immediately prompted fears of a new initiative to round up undocumented immigrants. \nBut officials said that it was routine operation to target “criminal aliens” and those who entered the country after having been deported. \nOf the St. Louis area arrests, nine men had convictions for crimes, including assault, battery, DUI, sale of a controlled substance, domestic assault and leaving the scene of an accident, according to ICE spokeswoman Gail Montenegro in an email response to Post-Dispatch questions. \nThree had previously been deported and had illegally re-entered the U.S., she wrote. \nSeven of those detained hailed from Mexico, three were from Guatemala, two from El Salvador and one came from Cuba, Montenegro said. Five were arrested in St. Louis and two were arrested in Caseyville. The others were single arrests ranging from Malden, Mo., in Dunklin County, to Champaign, Ill. \n“Every day, as part of routine operations, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Fugitive Operations teams target and arrest criminal aliens and other individuals who are in violation of our nation’s immigration laws,” Montenegro wrote. \nIn Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Kentucky and Kansas, 235 foreign nationals were arrested, the agency said. Of those, 163 had criminal convictions, 60 had been previously removed from the U.S. And 12 were “immigration fugitives with outstanding final orders of removal issued by a federal immigration judge.” Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T03:29:29.109+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
