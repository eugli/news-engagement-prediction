Nigel Harman as Lord Farquaad in Shrek - he is now directing the musical \nNigel said: “I had so much fun directing the original UK and Ireland Tour that I jumped at the chance to work on it again. Shrek the Musical has created pivotal moments in my career – firstly winning an Olivier and then my directorial debut. It’s certainly become one of the classic family musicals of all time and I’m really proud to be a part of it.” Read More Wicked in Manchester: 10 more musicals we want to see at the city's theatres \nProducers Caro Newling and Nick Salmon said: “Following the huge success of the first UK and Ireland tour, we are delighted that Shrek the Musical is returning Manchester in 2018.
