I felt so sorry for him as he shouldn't be playing there. \n\"It would have been like playing me at right wing. There's no way he can catch Jamie Vardy in a sprint if the team are pushed up to the halfway line.\" Klopp took his players to La Manga for a warm weather training camp (Photo: Liverpool FC) Carragher joked that the Reds players were having too much fun while in Spain (Photo: Liverpool FC) \nSpeaking on Sky Sports, Gary Neville called Liverpool's performance \"woeful\" at the break, but did find the time to crack a joke at their display alongside his co-host. \nTalking to Carragher, Neville asked: \"Liverpool have been off for two weeks, what were they doing in La Manga?\" The Reds legend quickly replied, while laughing, \"Drinking?\" \nLiverpool, who had a gap in their schedule due to no cup commitments, were in fact in Spain as part of a warm weather training camp and returned on Wednesday. poll loading Should Liverpool sack Jurgen Klopp? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:28:15.158+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
