Bad jokes aplenty. Can be gently prodded on Twitter at @kitsb1 \nNow, for any fans of #MarvelStudios out there, it's likely not all that difficult to identify just who is most responsible for the remarkable critical and commercial success of the #MarvelCinematicUniverse . After all, while the likes of Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans have become its icons, they haven't ultimately been the ones pulling the strings to make the whole thing happen — much as the influential likes of Joss Whedon and The Russo Brothers haven't been in charge of the big picture that we all love so much. \nInstead, the man with the plan is, and has always been, Marvel Studios President #KevinFeige . And it seems that the awareness of his central importance isn't limited to those of us watching the #MCU from the outside. Y'see: According To 'Doctor Strange' Star Benedict Wong, Kevin Feige Is Basically Just Stan Lee Kevin Feige [Credit: Marvel Studios] \nYup, that's right. According to #BenedictWong , who played #Wong in #Marvel 's recent #DoctorStrange solo movie, Feige is essentially just a modern-day Stan Lee, who deserves as much credit for the MCU as Lee received for the shepherding into being of the modern Marvel comic book universe. Indeed, as he recently told ComicBook.com: \n\"It's it fantastic that [the story is] slowly unfolding as we realize what these infinity stones are... It's amazing. Kevin Feige's just a continuation of Stan Lee. As much as Stan created all these characters within the comics with Kirby and with Steve Ditko, and it's just fantastic. I just think it's real credit to Kevin as the baton's been passed on. He is truly realizing and lifting you from the comic book. Lifting it from the scripts, and really garnering all these, in my book, incredible actors.\" \nAll of which confirms two key things, of course: One, Kevin Feige has the coolest job in the world, and two, Benedict Wong is a giant comic book nerd. Both of which are, if you're a fan of the MCU, very good things. \nWe'll just pretend not to remember that half of comic book-dom hates Stan Lee for being a commercializing sellout . \nWhat do you think, though? Is Kevin Feige the new Stan Lee — and if so, is that a good thing? Let us know below!
