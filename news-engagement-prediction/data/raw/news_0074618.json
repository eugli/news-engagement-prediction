A court provisionally upheld the request for the warrants, freezing 47,000 euro in Ms Caruana Galizia’s account. \nMs Caruana Galizia is contesting the warrants. \nHer lawyer, Joseph Zammit Maempel, pointed out that this case involved moral damages not real damages. \nHe asked how such damages could be quantified. At what stage could moral damages be converted to a credit? Only when a court found that the publication was defamatory could the damages be quantified. \nHe also pointed out that the last 100 or so libel judgments hardly ever granted maximum damages. \nMoreover, Ms Caruana Galizia had property and business. Why issue warrants on her bank accounts? \nHe also pointed out that both government and opposition were agreeing that precautionary warrants against journalists should be removed. Although this suggestion has not yet become law, EU law and judgments by the ECHR stated that freezing the assets of journalists went against their right to freedom of expression. \nThus, was it proper to issue such warrants at this stage? \nDr Pawlu Lia in reply, said the court had to apply the law as it stood today. Should the defendant feel aggrieved she may resort to a constitutional remedy. \nMs Caruana Galizia from the comfort of her home has a habit of writing about this and the other. In her blog she alleged that Dr Cardona and his consultant went to a brothel in Germany and engaged in a threesome with a female prostitute. The story was repeated several times for the blogger's personal profit. The greater the number of clicks, the greater the income generated via google ads. \nDr Lia remarked that Ms Caruana Galizia had stated a lie intended to stir up hatred against Dr Cardona for political reasons as envisaged under the Press Act. \nShe did not criticise his work while attending the conference in Germany but merely invented a story to arouse hatred and ridicule him. \nThis was intended to garner political advantage for those who supported her writing. \nThe facts alleged were obscene and outrageous thus calling for maximum punishment for the harm caused. \nDr Lia observed that the minister’s children while studying for exams, had to endure comments by their friends regarding the alleged antics of their father. \nAt this point, Ms Caruana Galizia burst out saying that it was the minister himself who embarrassed his children and that it was common knowledge that he cheated upon his wife. \n\"You should be ashamed of yourself \" she said as she stormed out of the courtroom declaring that she would listen to 'no more of this rubbish.' \nThe magistrate warned her lawyer to advise her not to repeat the scene. \nDr Lia said that since Ms Caruana Galizia had many previous court cases where she did not pay the fines imposed, the precautionary warrants were justified and not excessive especially when one considered the harm done by her. \nDr Lia concluded by declaring that he felt very strongly about this issue. He wanted to safeguard democracy. \nThe proposed changes by parliament to abolish precautionary warrants against journalists are not necessarily a step in the right direction. No one has the right to spew hatred and escape punishment, he argued. \nConstitutional rights issues were not always clear cut. Moreover one must bear in mind that rights and obligations went hand in hand. Real journalists should safeguard true facts. Ms Caruana Galizia called herself a journalist but she is not, the lawyer remarked. \nDr Zammit Maempel pointed out that his client was ready to face these proceedings so as to prove her case. \nRegarding Dr Lia's criticism of the proposed amendment to remove precautionary warrants against journalists, Dr Zammit Maempel questioned whether Dr Lia felt that the 71 members of parliament were all doing the wrong thing. « Muscat is his own men's prisoner - PN Advert <a href='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/ck.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=58249636599&n=d79c4867' target='_blank'> <img src='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/avw.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=58249636599&n=d79c4867' border='0' alt=''/> </a> \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T15:48:44.231+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
