That means the race's two front-runners, Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison and former Labor Sec. Tom Perez, are looking to pick up support from lesser-known candidates. \nMultiple sources told NBC News that Ellison has offered another candidate, New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Ray Buckley, a role leading DNC operations in exchange for his support. \n\"Nothing is off the table and we're seeing how we can best collaborate in a way that is best for the party,\" said one source close to Buckley. \nAsked about the strategy for his campaign going forward, Buckley replied, \"I'm confident the DNC will have a robust 50-state strategy.\"' \nA spokesperson for Ellison declined to comment.

His supporters may have different ideas about who should lead the party, or may have promised their support to other candidates in the event that their first choice fell through. \n\"You can't offer much,\" Rendell said, to coax supporters to follow you to another candidate. \nWith many DNC members choosing to keep their support private or hold off on endorsements, the state of the race is opaque. \nPerez claimed in an email on Tuesday to have the support of 180 DNC members. \nEllison's campaign manager, Jamie Long, responded by saying, \"we are on track to win next week,\" but declined to put out the number of their supporters. \nAll current whip counts, including those maintained by campaigns, are based on commitments, which don't always materialize on the ballot. \nRegardless, most Democrats expect the election will require multiple rounds of ballots in which lesser candidates are forced to drop out or cut deals until only one candidate emerges victorious. \nNeedless to say, it's a peculiar election. \n\"This race is like a cross between running for president and running for for high school student council,\" said one of the candidates, South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigeig, during the party's last official forum in Baltimore on Saturday.
