John Stephenson Wright \nDarren has also relived the moment he finally approached senior officers already investigating Wright to say ‘I’ve got another victim for you.’ \nWhen they asked ‘Who?’ he replied: ‘Me’. \nWright, now 68, a serial predator who went on to abuse other children, would sneak into Darren’s room at night having gained the trust of the family who he worked for in Rochdale . \nSpeaking to the M.E.N at GMP ’s HQ, Darren, 50, from Royton , said “It’s for other people I’m doing this, it’s not for me. \n“Children self-harm, take their own lives, get involved in drugs, alcohol, they become subjects of sexual exploitation because they don’t know any different. They grow up in that world, they think it’s the norm, but it’s not and they can break the cycle just by speaking out. \n\"If one reads the paper and thinks ‘He’s a 50-year-old cop. If he can do it then I’m sure that I can do it,’ then this is worthwhile.” Read More \nDarren was abused by Wright, also known as Steve Wright, when he worked for his parents in Rochdale where they ran a pub. \nWright, then 30, became a family friend, bought Darren gifts and earned his trust. \nBut he started staying over if he worked late - and at night would sneak into Darren’s room. The abuse continued for several months. \nDarren feared telling his parents would tear his family apart. \n“I didn’t know if it was right or wrong for a few years. It was a big secret. \n“My mum was of a nervous disposition and if I’d have told my dad he’d have done something drastic and that would probably have seen him sent to prison. \n”Times were very different then.” Darren Kenny as a boy \nIt wasn’t until 2002, when his mum died following the death of his father in 1995, that Darren finally opened up. \nHe added: “That’s when I told my brother about the abuse. We had both thought he had passed away so decided not to speak out further. I had a kind of closure thinking he was dead and couldn’t harm others.” \nBut in 2014, Darren found a website for paedophile victims - along with a report on Wright detailing his offences and prison sentences. \nDarren realised Wright was still alive. \nHe added: “The world didn’t fall apart but I got upset and felt sick. The house was empty, I was in tears. I rang Childline and blurted it out.” \nHe was referred to a psychologist, who has helped Darren deal with his painful past. \nOnce Darren knew Wright was still alive, he knew what he had to do. \n“I discussed it with my supervisor then rang the investigating officer,” he said. \n“I said ‘I’ve got another victim for you.“Who,” they asked. “Me,” I said. \nHe added: “Because of what I do I have a very black and white attitude towards things, there is no grey area. I knew when he wasn’t dead I would have to do something about it. I just thought to myself has he had a chance to do it again? It made me feel sick. \n“Times have changed – years ago when I was a school kids didn’t talk. Now it’s completely different, you go to the cops, a social worker, a group, there are people there who are trained to recognise things and know how to deal with it.” Darren Kenny \nIt emerged Wright had committed several other offences in the Rochdale area. \nAn investigation was followed by a trial at Manchester’s Minshull Street Crown Court at which Darren gave evidence. \nHe added: “It was about getting him convicted. I wanted my day in court. Through the trial he maintained I was telling lies. But this is part of the closure – stand up in court, look at him and say ‘you are going back to prison’. I had closure when I thought he was dead, now I have it again.” \nBut Darren says he can’t forgive the man who stole his childhood. \nHe added: “It’s the effect he’s had on me, the knock-on effect on my family. My extended family. I’ll never know what my personality would have been like if that hadn’t happened. I’m quite a strong person but I’ll never know what I would have been. He’s ripped the heart out off it. He’s inadvertently destroyed my family life. \n“I contributed towards that by not saying anything about it. That shouldn’t have been my burden, but it was, I regret it now. \n“But in the seventies and eighties what were you going to do go to your dad and say ‘this guy’s done this?’ It would have destroyed them, my dad would have ended up in prison for a criminal offence. There’s absolutely no doubt about that. \n\"I let them die without ever knowing, which is one of the hardest things. I wanted to keep my family together. My mum couldn’t live without my dad and vice versa. “ Read More \nHis family - his wife, 22-year-old daughter and 20-year-old son, have given Darren their full support. \nBut keeping the secret, he says, affected his relationship with his own children. \nHe added: “That’s one of the sick things about it – I missed out on important moments with my children. Getting them out the bath, changing their nappies. My wife must have thought I was bone idle – but it was the fact I was petrified. \n“Some people have the theory that the abused becomes an abuser and I just tried to distance myself. I took myself as far away from it as I could. \n“The closeness, the emotional stuff – there was a gap in it. That’s what’s really hurt me more than anything else.” Darren Kenny \nBut it has also given Darren the ability to truly empathise with the vulnerable victims he protects. \nHe added: “I’m a rape specialist. I think because of my experience I can empathise more with the victims. I believe all of them, I always walk in with an open mind and even if what you are being told is vague you get a feel that something happened. Being a victim made me more sensitive to their issues.” \nHe added: “Their only security blanket at that time is us. I’m not going to leave a victim without the doors nailed shut, locks back on, family member there, I’ve brewed up, done everything I can. \n“I go back to kids I’ve dealt with to check on them.” \nIt was finding his mother dead from a heart attack 13 years ago that spurred Darren to reassess his life and join Greater Manchester Police. \nBefore that, he’d forged a successful career as an engineer. \nHe added:”I know now that I substituted things I missed out on for material wealth, fancy cars, big houses, expensive watches. I just worked hard and dealt with it. I just had the best life that I could.” \nHe added: “But I wanted a change, I thought life was too short and I’d had enough.” \nIt’s that career change that helped Darren on the path to report the abuse. He now knows, first hand, that victims of sexual assault will be listened to. \n“The stigma is going,” he added. \n“Believe in the services you will be offered, the cops take it seriously the CPS will do their best to get the offender charged. Witness care falls into place and there is a system there. “All you have to do is pick the phone up and report it.” Read More Dealer Billy Black jailed over massive drugs plot did have a fair trial, appeal court rules \nSentencing Wright at Minshull Street Crown Court, Judge Jeffrey Lewis said he had to consider the defendant’s health, age and the fact he is already serving a 22-year sentence for similar crimes. \nHe described Wright as ‘cunning’ after hearing that he had bought sweets and a watch for Darren around the time of the abuse. \nHe added: “It was an abuse of hospitality. You were friendly to him and that no doubt helped you to carry out the abuse.” \nJudge Lewis said Wright has continued to deny the offences adding: “You say you never committed any offence against anyone.” \nWright was handed a further 18 months in prison meaning he will now serve 24 years behind bars. \nSpeaking outside court, Darren said the sentence was incidental. \nHe said: “The sentence doesn’t matter, the fact he was found guilty by a jury does matter. \n“I was just happy I finally got it dealt with and people believed a 13-year-old boy.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T00:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T19:47:02.781+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
