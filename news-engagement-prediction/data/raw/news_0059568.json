Miss Tappenden said: ‘It’s hard not knowing what it felt like to be pregnant or give birth. Tina in hospital with pictures of her scan. The encephalitis was triggered by an ovarian cyst that made her immune system to go into overdrive and attack her brain ‘But Ava is the most amazing daughter and I couldn’t imagine my life without her now. I feel lucky and privileged.’ The care worker’s nightmare began in September 2015, a month after she discovered she was pregnant at the age of 21. She had completed a long shift and realised after the drive home that she couldn’t remember any part of the journey or the route she took. Tina in a coma in hospital. She was sectioned at one point because of the erratic behaviour her condition caused, and later placed in an induced coma after suffering a major seizure The following day she began suffering insomnia, became increasingly forgetful and started ‘obsessively’ drinking water. After a check-up at hospital she was told she was stressed about the pregnancy and advised to ‘have a bath and relax’. But 24 hours later she had a psychotic episode where she ran onto a busy dual carriageway and had to be sectioned and taken to a mental health hospital. Apart from feeling pain while in bed at home, Tina cannot recall the birth Miss Tappenden continued to deteriorate and she was too unwell to go for her 12-week scan. Four days later she had a fit and was taken to Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother Hospital in Margate, where doctors still couldn’t work out what was wrong, despite tests including two lumbar punctures and an MRI scan. She was transferred to an intensive care unit where a consultant neurologist suspected antibodies swirling around her body were causing encephalopathy. An EEG test confirmed there was swelling on the brain and an ultrasound showed the baby was healthy but an ovarian cyst had developed that was the same size as the foetus. Miss Tappenden suffered a series of seizures and was put into a coma for eight days to stabilise her condition. Three weeks later, Anti NMDA Receptor Encephalitis was positively identified - an acute form of the condition caused by an autoimmune reaction. Now Tina says she cannot imagine her life without Ava and feels 'lucky and privileged' She was treated with steroids and a plasma exchange to remove harmful substances from her blood. But she still had severe problems with her memory and had to be helped to walk and talk again due to the debilitating effect the seizures and encephalitis had on her brain before she was discharged in late January last year. Miss Tappenden, who is single and lives with her parents, gave birth to 5lb 3oz Ava seven weeks prematurely on February 27. But apart from feeling pain while in bed at home, she cannot recall any other part of the labour or Ava’s birth. ‘I remember them putting Ava on my chest after I gave birth and I refused to hold her because it didn’t feel right,’ she said. ‘She didn’t feel like my baby. I’d been robbed of my pregnancy and everything.’ Yet shortly afterwards, she started to make a remarkable recovery. Miss Tappenden said: ‘Everyone says I changed within hours of having Ava. It was like someone had switched a light on. The doctors think the pregnancy was holding back my recovery because of all the different hormones.’ Although she still suffers short-term memory loss, Tina says she has bounced back to her normal self The cyst was removed seven months after Ava was born and completed the recovery. ‘I have bounced back to my normal self – my head doesn’t feel fuzzy and I can absorb information again, although I still suffer with short-term memory,’ she said. Miss Tappenden, who will take anti-epilepsy medication for five years as a precaution, spoke out about her experience to mark World Encephalitis Day on Wednesday and to raise awareness of the condition. ‘I was wrongly diagnosed at the beginning. People can be diagnosed with mental illness when something else is wrong,’ she said. ‘I hope more people will be tested for encephalitis rather than people saying they are having a breakdown and sectioning them.’ Encephalitis, which affects 6,000 people in the UK each year, is caused by an infection invading the brain or the immune system attacking the brain in error. Mortality rates are high and those who survive are often left with brain damage, leading to cognitive, physical, emotional or behavioural problems. The Encephalitis Society has released new research which found two-thirds of the public don’t know what the condition is and nearly half have never heard of it. Chief executive Dr Ava Easton said: ‘Tina’s story highlights how quickly a person can deteriorate without the right treatment and the devastating effect of the illness on family and friends.’ Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:13:26.394+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
