The team rallied and completed the greatest comeback in the game's history, as they were down by 25 at one point, and 19 in the 4th quarter. \nEven as amazing as the comeback was, apparently the Super Bowl MVP, Tom Brady, wasn't completely thrilled with how it all played out. Even more than that, he's not on board with the fact that many are calling this game the greatest of Brady's entire career. \nSo, after setting Super Bowl records for most completions (43) and yards (466), what's the deal with Brady thinking otherwise? Well, he broke down the reasoning to MMQB's Peter King , and it was actually pretty valid.

The Patriots were honestly just brutally bad through the first half of that game, and it seemed as though there was a good chance they'd get blown out. Now, it might have been the greatest second half (and overtime) by any single player, though. \nRegardless, what Brady did in Super Bowl 51 will never be forgotten, and he's more than added to his already-stellar legacy.
