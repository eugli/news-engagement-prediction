Naomi Hefter suffered a barrage of sexual harassment as she walked the streets of London. \nAt one point, a photographer shamelessly attempted to take photos of her legs as she stood at the side of a busy road. \nWhen she challenged the man and told him to stop, he insisted he was well within his rights to take pictures of her. \n\"The idea of how he thought it was OK to do that, the entitlement, is just beyond belief,\" said Naomi. \"I felt quite violated by it,\" she added.

Of those, 40% feared violence with 20% actually suffering violence as a result. \nWhile some may dismiss sexual harassment as banter, Pagan-Lilley Motlagh-Phillips knows better than most how quickly things can escalate, particularly if you try to ignore the perpetrators.

I couldn't walk for two weeks because the internal bruising was that severe. And that was all because of me not responding to 'are you alright?'.\" \nFor the past year, Nottinghamshire Police has treated misogyny as a hate crime on a par with racism and homophobia. Nottinghamshire Police are treating misogyny as a hate crime.
