But I am afraid I must take exception to Amber Rudd’s remarks on closing the Dubs scheme to resettle unaccompanied minors, after accepting only 350 of them. Ms Rudd stated that British and French authorities feared that the existence of the Dubs scheme was “a pull factor” for refugee children to head to Britain and provided opportunities for people traffickers.\nSuch opportunities already abound as a result of the sorry mess of the European policy response to the refugee crisis in the Mediterranean. The Dubs scheme is a small beacon of humanity in the midst of this mess, providing safety and protection to children who would otherwise be vulnerable to trafficking.\nSyrian refugee children reduced to selling on Beirut streets to support families Read more \nThe UK government has repeatedly confused the issues of people smuggling and human trafficking , something that is unhelpful in dealing with either phenomenon. People smuggling relates to entering countries irregularly. Human trafficking is the process of delivering people into forced labour or sexual exploitation. \nAs far back as 2006, Anti-Slavery International identified how people trafficked into western Europe often entered perfectly legally, but then had their migration status made irregular by their traffickers. In turn this reduces their options for protection and support, as seeking such help could result in their deportation. And, if they risk being deported to a place where their lives and those of their families are at risk, their dependency on their traffickers becomes all the more acute.\nThe absence of a comprehensive approach to the refugee crisis in the Mediterranean, particularly the absence of safe migration options for vulnerable people fleeing war has been the single greatest factor to increase the risk of human trafficking in Europe over the past two years. Europe’s inhumane approach to this crisis has rendered thousands – who are desperately seeking escape from war – vulnerable to exploitation and enslavement. \nEurope ignores Nigeria humanitarian crisis at its peril, warns top UN official Read more \nIt is true that the UK’s humanitarian response in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey has been both imaginative and impressive. But the proximity of the Middle East to Europe means that a traditional humanitarian response to the crisis, one that is focused substantially only the immediate theatres of war, can only be partial. \nPeople will not accept confinement to the poverty of a refugee camp if there is the prospect of a better life just beyond the horizon. Europe and the world must develop a response to this challenge that incorporates safe migration away from the war zone and economic aid to provide employment opportunities for refugees in the region, as well as basic camp management, health and nutrition for refugees.\nIt is a peculiar stretch of logic to suggest that a scheme that protects children at risk of trafficking by giving them a safe migration option “provides opportunities for people traffickers”. It will perhaps be a matter for comment by some future historians that at this shameful period of European history some of the most vocal European leaders on the issue of slavery have been noticeably negative with regard to the formulation of an effective pan-European response to this refugee crisis. It is this absence that increases the risks of trafficking, not Alf Dubs’ honourable scheme, which instead reflects the very greatest British traditions of practical humanity and human rights.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T09:19:43.098+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
