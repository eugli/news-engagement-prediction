The facility holds convicted criminals who have been sentenced to 18 months or less. \nA spokesman for Schuh said joining the federal program would be part of Anne Arundel County's \"moderate and measured approach\" to immigration enforcement. County police would not be involved in the program, spokesman Owen McEvoy said. \nJurisdictions in Maryland are divided over helping the federal government enforce immigration law. Frederick and Harford counties already participate in the 287(g) program. Baltimore and Howard County have taken steps recently to reinforce their acceptance of people regardless of their immigration status.
