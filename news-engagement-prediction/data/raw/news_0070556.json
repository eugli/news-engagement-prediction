I just had to be in Brazil to make Dance of Time .\" \nElias first made her name on the Manhattan jazz scene as a piano prodigy three decades ago and still lives in New York. She first traveled back to a Brazilian recording studio to make her last album, 2015’s Grammy-winning Made in Brazil . \nShe was pulled back again by the 100th anniversary of the samba, marked by the recording of the song “Pelo Telefone.” \nDance of Time , set for release March 24 on Concord Jazz, features esteemed Brazilian musicians including João Bosco and Toquinho , both known for their personal takes on bossa nova and other styles. \nElias, a Sao Paulo native better known for performing in clubs and concert halls than shaking it on the streets, brings her cosmopolitan flair and her innate Brazilian groove to classics including “Samba de Orly” and “Copacabana,” as well as the Frank Sinatra standard “You’re Getting to Be a Habit With Me.” \nJust in time for Carnival, which starts Friday (Feb. 24) in Brazil, Billboard premieres a first track from the album: Elias’ swinging recording of the track “Sambou Sambou,” an ode to the samba by João Donato. \nListen (and dance) here:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T16:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T11:54:16.524+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
