By David Moye \nAn Ohio woman is facing charges of gross sexual imposition after she allegedly gave a lap dance to a 100-year-old man with dementia. \nBrittany Fultz was arrested Friday for an incident that alllegedly took place in December at The Commons of Providence, a senior living facility in Sandusky, according to the Sandusky Register. \nAnother employee shot footage that allegedly shows Fultz straddling the victim’s leg and writhing on his leg. \nShe can be heard saying, “I can show you new things, I can show you new things.” \nSandusky Detective Anthony Bath says the video shows clear evidence of elder abuse. \n“She is basically harassing him,” Bath told Cleveland station WJW. “It’s disturbing. She is touching him. This was not something he wanted.” \nThe 26-year-old suspect was charged with gross sexual imposition, a fourth-degree felony. She was released on bond the same day, but could face other charges, according to authorities. Erie County Jail \nFultz’s attorney, Geoffrey Oglesby said the lap dance was a prank meant to make the victim feel good. He also said the man could have told her to stop, but didn’t. \n“The man knew exactly what was going on and had no problem whatsoever with it,” Oglesby told the Associated Press. \nThe woman who taped the video told a supervisor about the incident on Feb. 12, after which it was immediately reported to police, according to the Sandusky Register. \nThat woman is not being charged, but she, like Fultz, is no longer working at The Commons of Providence. \nStaci Lehmkuhl, executive director of The Commons of Providence, told reporters, “We are cooperating with local police who are handling the investigation and we will not comment further about the ongoing investigation.” ALSO ON HUFFPOST Tips For Choosing An Elderly Caregiver Tips For Choosing An Elderly Caregiver 1 5 Review The Agency Checklist One of the first decisions in choosing an elderly caregiver is deciding whether to interview independent candidates or look to a caregiving agency , according to Caring.com.
