It has 250,000 likes and over 68,000 shares. One problem: Kuwait denies that it’s true. Trump’s post, which is still up as of Sunday morning, read: “Smart! 'Kuwait issues its own Trump-esque visa ban for five Muslim-majority countries | Al Bawaba,’” citing the source of the information.\nMedia: MediaOS Video President Donald Trump has been a vocal critic of \"fake news,\" even going so far as to call CNN a fake news organization . Now the president is under fire for sharing an apparently false news story on his own Facebook page .\nThe article claims Kuwait has imposed its own Trump-inspired ban on travelers and immigrants from five Muslim-majority countries. The story by Al Bawaba is riddled with typos and claims, \"Syrians, Iraqis, Iranians, Pakistanis and Afghans\" will not be able to enter the country while the ban is in place.\nPresident Trump, or whoever runs his social media, posted it to Facebook on Thursday along with the caption, \"Smart!\"\nHowever, Kuwait denies the existence of any such ban. Kuwait's foreign ministry \"categorically denies these claims and affirms that these reported nationalities ... have big communities in Kuwait and enjoy full rights,\" according to Reuters .\nAs of Sunday morning, the post has not been taken down. It has garnered more than 250,000 likes and has been shared more than 68,000 times.", "external_links": ["http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-immigration-kuwait-idUSKBN15K09O", "http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/the-wrap/article/Trump-Blasts-CNN-as-Fake-News-During-Black-10900220.php", "https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/", "https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=1x4&iu=/36117602/hnp-beaumontenterprise.com/Video&ciu_szs=300x250,728x90&cust_params=video_player%3Dmediaos&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=xml_vast2&unviewed_position_start=1&url=%5Breferrer_url%5D&description_url=%5Bdescription_url%5D&correlator=%5Btimestamp", "https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/posts/10158589407710725"], "published": "2017-02-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:02:57.525+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
