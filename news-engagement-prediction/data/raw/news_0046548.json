Sanchez / Chicago Tribune) John von Rhein in particular, than Sergei Prokofiev.\nChicago is indelibly associated with the world premieres of two of the Russian composer's most important works, his Third Piano Concerto and opera \"The Love for Three Oranges,\" both of which he oversaw here in 1921. As a matter of fact, the performances he gave in Chicago over a period of two decades, as pianist and conductor, launched his American career. \nBeginning with Prokofiev's CSO debut in 1918 and ending with his final appearance with the orchestra in 1937 (when he led the U.S. premiere of selections from his as-yet-unstaged ballet, \"Romeo and Juliet\"), he appeared with the CSO in no fewer than seven different programs. \nAlthough his initial impressions of our city were disappointing (he found the Chicago of 1918 sooty and unattractive), he later came to relish the attention heaped on him by the city's musical press (one reporter called him \"the best-dressed man\" in town) and concert audiences, whom he found more receptive to his music than those in New York, as Philip Huscher recounts in his informative essay in the current CSO program book. \nIf the Chicago Symphony is lavishing an unusual amount of attention on Prokofiev's music this season — this, in honor of the 125th anniversary of his birth — the orchestra and Riccardo Muti are reserving their biggest celebratory guns for this weekend's subscription concerts at Symphony Center. \n  \nThere, the music director will lead the CSO and Chicago Symphony Chorus, Chicago Children's Choir, vocal soloists and narrators in the CSO premiere of an oratorio drawn from Prokofiev's music to the great Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein's unfinished film classic, \"Ivan the Terrible\" (1942-45). \nChicago audiences are much more familiar with the cantata Prokofiev based on his soundtrack for an earlier Eisenstein film, \"Alexander Nevsky,\" than they are with the music for \"Ivan the Terrible.\" For various reasons Prokofiev never got around to turning the latter score into a concert work. That task fell to Abram Stasevich, the Russian conductor who had recorded the \"Ivan\" soundtrack. \nThe \"Ivan the Terrible\" oratorio Stasevich created in 1962, nine years after Prokofiev's death, draws from the film script to construct a narration meant to substitute for Eisenstein's richly allusive cinematic imagery. For these CSO performances, Czar Ivan IV will be impersonated by French actor Gerard Depardieu, a longtime Muti friend and collaborator. The spoken Russian narration provided by Depardieu and Yasen Peyankov will tie together the 20 musical cues to produce a dramatic chronology paralleling that of the film. \nEisenstein dropped his plan to shoot a third part of the film following Soviet dictator Josef Stalin's banning Part 2 of the planned trilogy. That official condemnation ended Eisenstein's career as a film director and Prokofiev's as a film composer. Part 2 of \"Ivan\" wasn't screened in public until 1958, five years after Stalin's death and a decade after Eisenstein's. (Prokofiev and Stalin passed away the same day in 1953.) \nWhy the ban? Stalin expected Eisenstein's grand cinematic portrait of Ivan Grozny — the 15th century Russian ruler who overcame enormous internal and external resistance to unite a fragmented empire — to reflect glory on himself: The czar's relentless cruelty could be used as a means of justifying the brutality of Stalin's own reign of terror. \nEisenstein, however, had a more nuanced portrait of Ivan in mind. The czar depicted in the director's brilliantly stylized film is a lonely and sorrowful man, deprived of love, betrayed by his friends. Part 2 suggests Ivan's psychological decline, and that did not sit at all well with his paranoid modern counterpart. The film was withdrawn. \"Ivan the Terrible\" would languish in obscurity until the Khrushchev \"thaw.\" \nMuti's belief in the high artistic merit of Prokofiev's music for the film dates from the early 1970s, when he conducted the Stasevich reworking for the first time with the Hilversum Orchestra in the Netherlands. He went on to lead performances in London, Philadelphia, New York, Paris, Milan, Florence and Naples, Italy. Critics have long rated his 1977 recording, made with the Philharmonia Orchestra, as a benchmark interpretation. \nIn an interview last week, Muti recalled that he discovered the score in the early 1970s at a music shop in Vienna. Fascinated, he then sought to familiarize himself with the Eisenstein epic, then little known outside cult circles. \n\"It's a great film with a fantastic score,\" he said. \"I have conducted 'Alexander Nevsky' many times and I find the musical ideas even more interesting in the later film score. The choral parts and orchestration are richer as well, with all kinds of moods and colors.\" \nAt Muti's behest, the CSO screened Eisenstein's unfinished masterpiece Sunday evening at Orchestra Hall. Those who missed the screening, or are unfamiliar with the score, should not feel at a loss, Muti said. \n\"The music can stand perfectly well on its own — it doesn't need the film,\" he said of the 80-minute sequence Stasevich drew from the three hours of music Prokofiev delivered to Eisenstein. \"In many instances, Eisenstein based his visual images directly on music Prokofiev had already written. The music has its own life. All one needs to do is listen.\" \nThe conductor's recording of \"Ivan the Terrible\" — the first made in the West — served to focus the attention of many listeners on the strengths of Prokofiev's final film score. Since its initial appearance other conductors, and Russian music scholars as well, have taken up the cause of \"rehabilitating\" the music and bringing it to the attention of a wider public. \nA variety of concert versions now exists on recording. Conductors Leonard Slatkin and Mstislav Rostropovich have released recordings with English-language narration, Slatkin opting for the Stasevich edition (which he introduced to Grant Park in 1977), Rostropovich for an edition prepared by Michael Lankester. Neeme Jarvi has recorded a \"concert scenario\" compiled by Christopher Palmer that dispenses with the narration and the more fragmentary episodes included in the Stasevich version. \nFollowing the 1997 publication of a new edition collating every piece of music Prokofiev wrote for the film (also some bits that were left out), there appeared a Russian recording, led by Vladimir Fedoseyev, of the complete film music incorporating music from the Russian Orthodox liturgy Prokofiev and Eisenstein selected for use in the movie. The entire film is available on home video (Criterion Collection). \nFinally, audience members should not be put off by the fact that the oratorio will be sung and spoken in Russian, since the CSO will employ English surtitles. \n\"They will be very impressed with the music and, if they happen to have seen the film, will appreciate all the more the genius of Eisenstein,\" Muti said. \"They will go home enriched by the Prokofiev score. For this is not just another evening at Orchestra Hall — it is a cultural event.\" \nThe only pity, perhaps, is that Prokofiev, who considered Chicago his American home in the early decades of the last century, won't be around for it. \nRiccardo Muti will lead the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and choruses, soloists and narrator in Prokofiev's oratorio \"Ivan the Terrible,\" at 8 p.m. Thursday, Friday and Saturday at Symphony Center, 220 S. Michigan Ave.; $34-$220; 312-294-3000, www.cso.org . \nSharps and flats \nA $50,000 MacArthur Foundation grant awarded to the Chicago Philharmonic Society will fund an exchange with Poland to share works by Chicago composers, connect with Polish musicians and students, and generally increase local awareness of Polish music and culture. \nThe exchange, which the orchestra announced Tuesday, will culminate in a three-day Chicago festival of Polish music and culture in November 2018. A Polish conductor and vocal and instrumental soloists will take part in orchestral and chamber concerts of works by Polish composers. Concerts will include music of several genres, ranging from classical to jazz to film. \nIn spring 2018, Scott Speck, the orchestra's artistic director, will travel to Poland with some of the musicians to lead master classes and workshops for music students. They also will perform new classical works by Chicago and American composers. \nThe Polish consulate general in Chicago is partnering with the society to present the festival. Richard Guerin, a New-York-based advocate for Polish music, is the curator of festival events. \n•The 18th Handel Week Festival will continue with a program of George Frideric Handel's vocal and instrumental chamber music, 7:30 p.m. Saturday at Grace Episcopal Church, 924 Lake St., Oak Park; tickets are $30. \nArtistic director Dennis Northway will lead the concluding festival event, a performance of Handel's oratorio \"Alexander's Feast,\" 3 p.m. March 5 at the church; tickets are $35.
