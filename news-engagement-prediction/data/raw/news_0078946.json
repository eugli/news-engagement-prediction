a figure he has reached for nine successive seasons - as Barca turned up the heat on La Liga rivals Real Madrid. \nIt was far from a vintage Barcelona performance, with Rafinha’s scrappy second-half opener having been cancelled out by Diego Godin’s header, yet Messi’s late strike in a 2-1 success seriously dented Atlético’s own title aspirations as their winless run against Luis Enrique’s men was extended to 20 domestic games. \nTwelve days on from their 4-0 drubbing against Paris St Germain in the Champions League, Enrique approached their next away game by deploying a back three of Gerard Piqué, Samuel Umtiti and Jérémy Mathieu - not that the formation tweak prevented Madrid from finding holes in the defence. \nYannick Carrasco failed to take advantage when losing Sergi Roberto at the back post and Godin stabbed over after Umtiti failed to clear a corner. \nGabi steered a half volley from the edge of the area straight at Marc-André ter Stegen before a first chance arrived for Antoine Griezmann when his goal-bound effort was blocked by Umtiti. \nAnother defensive lapse, this time from Piqué, allowed Griezmann to unleash a fierce attempt with his less-favoured right boot that Ter Stegen did well to tip over. \nThe visitors’ attacking triumvirate had been nullified until the 29th minute when Neymar led a break that ended with the ball in the Madrid net. \nThe Brazilian cut the ball back for Messi to fire at Jan Oblak and a mad scramble ensued between the goalkeeper, Luis Suárez and Filipe Luis, with the Barcelona striker being penalised for handling before heading home after Filipe Luis had clattered a clearance against his own woodwork. \nNevertheless, it seemed to encourage Barcelona as Oblak produced a stupendous one-handed stop from a Messi free-kick before stopping a Piqué header going beyond him on his line. \nSuárez should then really have given Barcelona the lead four minutes after the restart. He was sent through by Messi’s fine pass around the corner, yet the ball seemed to get caught under his feet and his attempt to bend his effort around Oblak resulted in it going well wide. \nHowever, it was the visitors who struck first anyway in the 64th minute in scrappy fashion. \nNeymar’s effort from the edge of the box was blocked and came out to Suárez, whose own try came off both Godin and Carrasco before falling to Rafinha to apply a first-time finish into the corner. \nThe lead lasted only six minutes as Godin’s second goal of the season drew the hosts level. The Uruguayan reached Koke’s free-kick from the left despite being sandwiched between Sergio Busquets and Umtiti and glanced an effort past Ter Stegen. \nUntil that point Messi was having a frustrating afternoon and he was booked for dissent before delivering a late winner for the second straight weekend. \nFrom his own free-kick, the home side failed to clear and Suárez picked out the unmarked Argentinian and though Stefan Savic blocked the first attempt, he reacted quickest to stab home the rebound and crush Atlético’s resistance once more.
