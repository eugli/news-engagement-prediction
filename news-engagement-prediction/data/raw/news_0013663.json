Christopher Furlong via Getty Images \nThe former UKIP leader was pounding the streets with his successor Paul Nuttall when the pair were forced to dodge an egg thrown by a youth as they arrived in Stoke ahead of a crucial by-election where the party is hopeful of winning the seat from Labour. Christopher Furlong via Getty Images \nThe incident occurred as Farage’s wife confirmed today she and her husband have led “separate lives” for years . \nKirsten Farage said the former Ukip leader moved out of their family home in Kent “a while ago” as it was reported the politician was sharing his London house with a French politician who heads a think tank at the centre of an investigation into the alleged illegal funding of Ukip. Christopher Furlong via Getty Images \nLast month it was confirmed Farage is joining Fox News as a contributor . \nFarage, who is still an MEP, has forged a close relationship with Donald Trump’s top team, and the US President has said Farage “would do a great job” if named the country’s ambassador to the US - even though there is a no position vacant.
