After the rejections, the Quakers found a solution to the 6-foot-11 obstacle.\nJunior Saddiq Bey and sophomore Jason Gibson caught fire from three-point range to quickly give Sidwell Friends breathing room in Sunday night’s Mid-Atlantic Athletic Conference final. After the hot hands cooled down, the Quakers defended and rebounded in numbers to hold off their Northwest Washington rival in a 67-57 win at St. Andrew’s in Potomac.\n“We shoot it a lot and I know that we can knock them down, so I wasn’t surprised by that start,” Bey said. “We all knew after that first quarter that we were going to have to grind it out a lot more.” \nBey finished with a game-high 29 points, and Gibson had 20. Both shooters hit three three-pointers in the opening quarter to give Sidwell Friends (23-6) a 27-20 lead. The Quakers combined for 26 points in the second and third quarters but still held a seven-point advantage heading into the fourth by preventing Garza and the Fighting Frogs from establishing any sort of offensive consistency. \nThe Iowa commit finished with 15 points — 10 below his season average — and did not score in the fourth quarter. Every time Garza made a move to the basket, he was either fouled or heavily contested by a swarm of Sidwell Friends defenders. \n“He knows how to handle that. He’s seen double teams all year long,” Maret Coach Chuck Driesell said. “But they were physical tonight, and they were clamping down on him, which is what they should do.”\nGarza’s fourth block of the game sparked a 5-0 run that cut Sidwell Friends’s lead to 57-53 with 21 /2 minutes left. Bey responded with his fourth three-pointer of the game and a pair of free throws to restore a comfortable advantage. \nMaret (24-4) trailed by seven with 90 seconds left before Sidwell Friends forced turnovers on three straight possessions to secure its first MAC title since 2012. After defeating Maret, 63-59, on Jan. 19 , the Quakers lost the rematch by 15 less than two weeks ago.\n“We learned from the first two games what it takes to play with a really good team like that,” Gibson said. “Today we wanted it a little more and we came out and played the best defense we have all year.”\nOver the noise of dueling student sections, the loudest support in the gym came from Sidwell Friends senior Jelani Williams , whose season ended with a torn anterior cruciate ligament in December . In the aftermath of the victory, the Pennsylvania commit thought back to his freshman season, when the Quakers went 0-12 in the conference.\n“That was a low point for Sidwell basketball, so to be able to move past that and not quit is a testament to our character and will to fight through adversity,” Williams said. “Now we’re the best team in the MAC.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T05:38:46.768+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
