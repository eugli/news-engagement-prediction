While the acquisitions of Mane and Wijnaldum have looked shrewd, Liverpool have still be wanting in pivotal areas. As with his first half-season in charge, Klopp saw his men hurtle into the festive period at full throttle, dissecting teams with their high intensity play despite the fixtures coming thick and fast. Just like his first campaign however, the Reds soon began to slow and falter in the new year. Injuries to star man Philippe Coutinho, Jordan Henderson and Adam Lallana falling at a similar time. When Liverpool were held by league strugglers Sunderland in their first game of 2017, Klopp had a telling substitutes bench comprising 18-year-old Trent Alexander-Arnold, 19-year-old Ovie Ejaria and 23-year-old Kevin Stewart. Tactics Noted as one of football's premier tacticians, Klopp has had his work cut out this season, with many fans and pundits alike still unconvinced he has made the right decisions out on the pitch. In the recent demise at the King Power Klopp opted to play diminutive midfielder Lucas at centre-back, despite having summer signing and orthodox defender Ragnar Klavan sitting on the bench. Klopp played Lucas at the heart of defence at the King Power, to disastrous consequences Lucas, inevitably, was found out by the blistering pace of Foxes forward Jamie Vardy and Klopp's tinkering was immediately exposed. James Milner as makeshift left-back likewise struggled. Club legend Jamie Carragher said after the game: 'I like Jurgen Klopp but I have worries with him. Liverpool are on course to concede 50 goals again this season and he hasn't gone to rectify it.' In what has been a constant balancing act to get things right this season, Klopp and Liverpool have essentially sacrificed results along the way. At the other end of the field, attempts to factor Sturridge back into his plans has seen Klopp, on several occasions, shift the dynamic of his side and suffer as a result. During the Reds' EFL Cup semi-final defeat to Southampton in late January Klopp opted to switch in Sturridge for the absent Mane - a move which again left Carragher questioning his former club. Daniel Sturridge appears to hinder the flow when tactics are switched to accommodate him 'When he (Sturridge) doesn't score your basically down to ten men,' was Carragher's damning assessment, while Klopp has been reluctant to adopt the move again since. Mentality Mind-set has been a huge factor for Liverpool this season, with the Reds seemingly only able to show up against top opposition. Klopp's side are undefeated against any of the top six this season, having picked up crucial victories at the Emirates and Stamford Bridge while taking points from Old Trafford and White Hart Lane respecitively. Beating struggling teams has been a constant mentality nightmare for the Reds this season The smaller teams however are the thorn in Klopp's side. The gritty, more direct football of the teams embroiled in the dogfight of potential relegation has tripped up Liverpool time and time again. In 2017 alone the Reds have been humiliated by Sunderland, Swansea and Hull City - two of which still occupy places in the bottom three at present. Liverpool's early season dominance of going toe-to-toe with the elite and coming out on top has the potential to count for nothing should the Reds struggle to overcome the barrier of the minnows and Klopp fail to find a solution to his mentality crisis. Style The question of style is a big one and the campaign is reaching a point where Klopp may well have to consider whether a reinvention of Liverpool's style is necessary to stop the rot and avoid further damage. When Liverpool sing from Klopp's hymn sheet collectively as one, the results are often devastating. Back in November Liverpool rocketed to the summit of the Premier League with a swashbuckling 6-1 demolition of Watford, making their title credentials clear. Much praise had been reserved for Klopp's side this season, with fellow manager Tony Pulis openly admitting the Liverpool side under the German is the toughest he's ever faced. Klopp has been repeatedly livid when the Reds have been found out and may need to reinvent KLOPP'S NEXT FIVE...
