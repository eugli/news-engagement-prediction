How to declutter \nPut it all together – then multiply by two or three children – and there's no room left in the house. We live like mice, scampering around the piles of boxes, bags and plastic crates. \n\"Why don't you put your car in the garage,\" someone said to me the other day, as I stood in the street scrapping bird poo off the duco, and all I could do was smile weakly. I guess that guy doesn't have children. \nMy kids are not the only ones. I met a young woman last week who confided that her parents had hired a storage unit to fit all the detritus left by their four children. They've had the storage unit for five years. It's not been opened once. There seems no intention to ever open it. \n\"What happened to our inheritance?\" the kids may ask themselves in 40 years' time as they study the accounts of their now impoverished parents. They'll chorus the answer: \"Kennards.\" Ad Feedback \nWell, not for me. Batboy has moved into his own place, a few hours from Sydney. It has a garage. I have quietly taken notice of its size. \nI decide on a blitzkrieg manoeuvre. I tell him that his mother and I are coming down, \"just for a visit\". Nice chap that he is, he expresses pleasure at the idea. \nMy week is spent heaving cartons from beneath beds and out of sheds. I unlock cupboards which spring open with the force of the clothing which been stuffed inside. I remove vast armfuls of books in languages that I don't understand, but he might. \nI lift them into the back of my ute. Soon I have the tray groaning, and am starting to fill the back seat. The school essays alone comprise three boxes. There are Presidential Libraries which feature less assiduous record-keeping. \nWe arrive on Friday night, but say nothing. \nOn Saturday morning, Jocasta and I unpack the vehicle before the household has awoken. We stack the boxes against a wall in the kitchen. I then make breakfast. Like the SAS in Afghanistan, I'm trying to launch an effective offensive, while at the same time winning hearts and minds. \nBatboy, his partner and their housemate, all wander into the kitchen, still sleepy eyed, only expressing mild surprise at the wall of boxes which has suddenly colonised one wall of their kitchen. \nI sit them down to their breakfast – eggs, bacon and some cooked tomatoes – and occupy myself opening the boxes. \nI pluck out random items, which I intend to place in piles marked \"keep\" or \"throw out\". I'll pack all the \"keep\" items back in their boxes, ready for storage in Batboy's garage. \nThe first item is a Leichhardt Saints soccer jersey from 1998. \"Chuck,\" says Batboy. \nJocasta looks up from her breakfast. \"Oh, you can't chuck that. It was in that jersey that they won their historic victory over the Burwood Titans.\" \nIt becomes the first item on the \"keep\" pile. \nNext is a bulldog-clipped series of letters to Santa, in which Batboy claims he's been \"a good boy all year\" and requests various items, including \"some Lego, some books, and some Lego\". \n\"Chuck\", says Batboy. \n\"You can't chuck that,\" says Jocasta. \"The way he says Lego twice, that's cute.\" \nI then pull out a series of cassette tapes from a short story competition Batboy won when he was eleven. \n\"Chuck,\" says Batboy. \"No one has cassette-players any more. Besides, the competition wasn't that big a deal.\" \nAt this point, Jocasta is speechless. She is without speech. That short story competition was the highlight of her life. She just shakes her finger to indicate the cassette must be kept, if not immediately digitised and sent to the Australian National Library for preservation. \nAnd so it goes – through the games and the finger paintings; through the golden books and the Lego; through \"Take Home Books\" from primary school to the tired, old baseball mitt of 2001. \nIn the end, Batboy accepts delivery of a crate of books in Indonesian and German, a cow-design onesie, and a skateboard. \nThe rest of it, under Jocasta's direction, I heave back into the tray of the ute, destination Sydney. \nAnyone have a number for Kennards? - SMH", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T08:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:15:10.500+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
