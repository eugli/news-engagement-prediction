Suspect in North Korea killing 'thought she was taking part in TV prank' Read more \nThe low-quality security camera footage , displayed by Fuji TV, shows two angles of the attack in which a man, believe to be Kim Jong-nam, is grabbed from behind by a woman in a white top. She appears to put her hands over his face and then swiftly walks away. A second woman is also seen leaving the scene. \nClearer closed-circuit video showed Kim Jong-nam, in a blue shirt and grey jacket, stumbling and wiping his face after the attack, seeking help from airport staff and walking unassisted to the terminal’s medical centre. \nThe Guardian cannot independently verify the people in the footage, although the location is certainly Kuala Lumpur International airport departures, where Malaysian police say the attack took place. \nThe killing has led to a diplomatic spat between the North Korean and Malaysia , a country that has until now had cordial diplomatic relations with the isolated Stalinist state. \nNorth Korea’s ambassador Kang Chol was summoned by the Malaysian foreign ministry on Monday after he accused police of acting in a “deceiving” manner and added that Malaysia was “concealing something”. He had demanded that no autopsy take place and the body be released immediately. Kuala Lumpur refused both requests so police could continue their investigation. \nOfficials from South Korea and the US, enemies of North Korea , believe Kim Jong-nam was killed by agents sent from Pyongyang. He had spoken out against his family’s dynastic control. \nMalaysia authorities have arrested four people – a Vietnamese woman, an Indonesian woman, a Malaysian man, and North Korean man – and are seeking four North Koreans suspects who left the country the same day Kim Jong-nam died. \nThe detained Indonesian woman has said she was duped into playing a role in the killing, believing she was part of a television comedy prank. \nInvestigators are considering whether the incident may have been a coordinated political assassination, although autopsy results have been inconclusive, police say.
