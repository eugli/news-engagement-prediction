The win is more of a result of their malpractice than merit,” Chavan told reporters. Replying to questions on the loss in Mumbai, Chavan said it was not right to blame party’s city unit chief Sanjay Nirupam alone. “It’s a team work. It’s the team than wins or loses,” he said. \nIn the all-important Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections, the Congress was relegated to the third position with 31 seats. Shiv Sena secured the first position by winning 84 seats, followed by BJP with 82 seats. \nTaking moral responsibility for Congress’ poor performance in BMC, party’s city unit chief Sanjay Nirupam today offered to resign from his post. \nYou May Also Want To Watch: \nVice president of Congress’ Maharashtra unit, Ratnakar Mahajan told PTI, “The results are mixed with the party doing well in Zilla Parishads while suffering reverses in the municipal corporations.
