He shot the theory down, but wondered if maybe there was a little Stinson in Sheldon after all: \n\"I find this fascinating that I have this loose-ish connection to this part, and you've got this theory — that's not true — but you've got that theory at all. Maybe I'm giving that vibe off. Maybe underneath this character I've been playing is a raging horndog and a womanizer.\" It's a possibility. 'The Big Bang Theory' [Credit: CBS] \nParsons wasn't the only person who felt like he wasn't right for Barney Stinson. In an interview with AV Club, NPH reveals that he thought he was all wrong for the role, too, which is loosely based on a friend of the two creators of the show: \n\"[The pilot script] was clever, but the character was written as a Jack Black, John Belushi type, so I thought, at 6 feet tall and 160 pounds, I probably would not be thought of as that guy... There is a friend of [the creators] that they sort of wrote Barney around, and I met him. He's not named Barney, but he does love Vegas, and cigars, and strip clubs. That kind of guy.\" Barney Stinson 'How I Met Your Mother' [Credit: CBS] \nClearly, the casting directors at #HowIMetYourMother made the right choice. HIMYM went off the air in 2014, but The Big Bang Theory is still going strong in Season 10. Maybe it's not too late for a crossover episode, or at least a little cameo? Poll Do you think Sheldon might be Barney in a parallel universe? Yes! Uhhhh, no. Bazinga! \nCheck out the promo for the next episode of The Big Bang Theory , which airs Thursday on CBS.
