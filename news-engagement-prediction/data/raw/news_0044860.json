Meanwhile, their 54 goals conceded was the sixth-worst in MLS - not a recipe for success. \nRevs hoping to build off 2016 lessons \nBut New England has pieces. The Revolution acquired Kei Kamara midseason while it will finally get Xavier Kouassi into the midfield after a season-ending injury prevented him from seeing the field for the team in 2016. New England also has a pair of new center backs and will feature a different starting keeper than it began last season with. It still has Juan Agudelo, Lee Nguyen and Kelyn Rowe - three dynamic offensive weapons in attack. \nCoach Jay Heaps will have to integrate his new spine quickly in order to make sure his new backline and keeper get on the same page and hope to limit disruptions to the revitalized attack. But with the talent on hand, the Revolution figure to challenge for a playoff spot in the Eastern Conference once again. How did the Revolution perform in 2016? \n2016 finish: Seventh in Eastern Conference (11-14-9), missed the playoffs \nThe Revolution won five of their last seven games, following the implementation of the 4-4-2 formation. The run fell just short however, as they lost out on the last playoff spot to the Philadelphia Union on goal difference. The Revolution's key offseason losses \nThe Revolution overhauled the spine of the defense this winner, saying goodbye to veterans Jose Goncalves and Darrius Barnes along the backline, while keeper Bobby Shuttleworth was traded to Minnesota. Defensive midfielder Gerson Koffie was also not brought back. \nSteve Neumann and Jordan McCrary did not have their contracts renewed. The Revolution's key offseason additions \nXavier Kouassi was a signing last season, but never got into a game with New England after he sustained a season-ending ACL injury while still with his previous team, FC Sion of the Swiss Super League. He'll slot in and hope to fill a void at one of the pivot spots that has not been adequately filled since Jermaine Jones ' departure following the 2015 season. \nThe backline has been remade, with a pair of new centerbacks. Antonio Mlinar Delamea joins from the top division in Slovenia while Benjamin Angoua will spend the season on loan from Ligue 1 side Guingamp. Brian Wright was taken in the SuperDraft while Femi Hollinger-Janzen was reacquired after the team lost him in the expansion draft earlier this offseason. How will the Revolution starting lineup look in 2017? \nThe Revolution finished the season on fire in the 4-4-2 diamond, scoring 15 goals in just seven games, and winning five of those contests. They'll stick with the formation this season, though the 4-3-3 will likely get some action as well. \nKouassi is in the mix to start, with one of the other midfielders dropping out, though the Revolution may ease him in after he missed all of last season. The 4-3-3 look will likely feature Teal Bunbury coming into the side as well. \nThe other battle is in goal. Former U.S. youth international Cody Cropper is certainly in the mix, but veteran Brad Knighton could end up starting when all is said and done.
