The YouTuber joins fellow makeup vlogger Kandee Johnson , celebrity makeup artist Etienne Ortega, and Disney star Sabrina Carpenter, reports WWD . It makes total sense that Revlon would choose these influencers to help the company reach even more beauty-obsessed people. Gorgeous boasts 2.2 million Instagram followers, Johnson has 1.5 million, Ortega has 460k, and Carpenter has 10.8 million followers. That's a massive reach. And, as WWD points out, they each reach a bit of a different audience within the beauty community. Many follow Gorgeous for her refreshing thoughts on gender identity, as well as a real-life approach to beauty with hacks and tricks to look your best. She's excited to join the Revlon team, because she used to brand as a teenager—which is when she started her YouTube channel.

For the 17-year-old actor/singer, she appreciates how affordable Revlon is. \"At my age, you don’t want to spend $100 to have nice eyelashes,\" she told WWD .
