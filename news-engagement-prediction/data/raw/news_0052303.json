PUBLISHED: 10:48, Wed, Feb 22, 2017 | UPDATED: 10:53, Wed, Feb 22, 2017 \nThe former Ukip leader failed to hide his annoyance, as the man accused Farage of presenting his listeners with unreliable facts and offered his own \"accurate and fact-checkable\" statistics. \nSeething against the anti-EU MEP, the LBC caller claimed freedom of movement generates £28million a day for the UK economy. \nHaving none of it, Farage exploded into a rant as he lambasted the caller for using the Remain camp’s old arguments to make a point. \nThe LBC host roared: \"I've never heard such baloney or such spurious statistics in my life. We do not need to be members of a political union to buy and sell goods from each other.

I've never heard such baloney or such spurious statistics in my life Nigel Farage \nRaging against Mr Juncker, urged the country to “stand up” to the demands. \n“Like all divorces, this needs to be a fair deal for both sides, we need to have a proper rational assessment of our costs, assets and liabilities,” Mr Farage said. \n“But by asking for 50 billion sterling after we leave - Jean Claude-Juncker is taking the mickey!” \nFarage continued: “We need to stand up and start getting tough, Mrs May needs to say ‘we’re going to stop paying into this budget until you sit down round the table with us so we can work out a proper long term deal’. \n“I want us to be fair, but to quote a former prime minister, we want our money back!” Brexit: Which parts of the UK had the majority vote? Fri, February 17, 2017 Much of the North East of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union including Sunderland, Gateshead, Darlington, Durham, Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Stockton, Redcar and Cleveland, North Tyneside and South Tyneside, and Northumberland. Newcastle was the only borough to vote to remain.

That’s the reality and you can find in the accounts of the EU.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:53:43.311+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
