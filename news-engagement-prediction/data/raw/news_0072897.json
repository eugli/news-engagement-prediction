Lake Central's Gabrielle DeVries performs on the balance beam during Saturday's Chesterton Sectional. (Kyle Telechan / Post-Tribune) Dave Melton Post-Tribune \nChesterton freshman Whitney Siewin had one responsibility at Saturday's Chesterton Sectional: vault. \nAll season long, she had struggled with keeping her legs straight while flipping through the air. \n\"I got it once during a dual meet with Crown Point, but I didn't land it,\" she said. \"Then I tried it at practice (Friday) night, and I got it.\" \nShe hit it again during the sectional meet, winning the event with a 9.5 and wrapping up Chesterton's team title â€” its first since 2003. \n\"She did the best vault I've ever seen from her,\" Chesterton coach Dawn Matthys said of Siewin. \nBut Siewin was far from the only contributor to Chesterton's team score of 113.525, topping Valparaiso's second-place score of 111.5. \nSophomore Jordan Bush had the highest score on floor (9.65), and freshman Sophie Hunzelman took care of the rest by winning beam (9.725), bars (9.65) and all-around (38.4). \nBut the individual accolades were not what had Hunzelman beaming after the meet. \n\"I was more excited for the team win,\" she said. \"We've been undefeated all season, and it's just really exciting. It's been our year.\" \nMatthys confirmed that in spite of her team's first-place score, it was not one of the Trojans' best performances of the season. \n\"It wasn't a great day for us,\" she said. \"So it's still great to come out with a 113 on what was not our best day. It feels good. We've led all year, we've been undefeated all year and it's great to stay in that same spot.\" \nThe closest competition came for third place in the team standings. Merrillville (110.325) finished third to earn the final team berth to the Valparaiso Regional, just ahead of Michigan City (110.15), Portage (109.3) and Crown Point (108.65). \nMerrillville senior Heather Osorio did not practice all week while nursing an injury to her right leg. But she still managed a second-place score of 9.55 on bars to help the Pirates clinch third. \n\"I was pretty nervous,\" Osorio said while sporting a protective boot on her right leg. \"Once I got through warmups, that was the most I'd done all week. It was hurting, but I couldn't stop because this was all for my team.\" \nAlong with the top three teams, eight other gymnasts qualified for the Valparaiso Regional. \nMichigan City's Megan Gushrowski (beam), Meghan Miller (vault) and Caroline Weber (floor), Lake Central's Gabrielle DeVries (vault), Crown Point's Paige Hein (beam) and Shannon Harrison (beam, floor), LaPorte's Sarah Zygmuntowski (floor) and Portage's Michaella Drake (all-around) all advanced. \nDave Melton is a freelance reporter for the Post-Tribune.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T07:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T04:49:59.721+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
