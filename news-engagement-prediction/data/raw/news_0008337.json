Budweiser’s 2017 Super Bowl commercial “Born The Hard Way” shows the story of a German immigrant coming to America. (Budweiser) \nThe ad, which is set in the 1800s, depicts Busch’s journey to America while on a ship through several storms. After he had arrived, Busch faced discrimination because of his German heritage with people telling him, “You’re not wanted here” and “go back home.” \nBusch eventually settled in St. Louis, Mo., where he met his father-in-law Eberhard Anheuser – who also appeared in the commercial – and the two went on to create the company. \nRicardo Marques, vice president of marketing at Budweiser, said the commercial “will resonate with today's entrepreneurial generation – those who continue strive for their dreams.\" \nSuper Bowl LI will air Sunday.
