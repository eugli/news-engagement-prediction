While Priyanka Chopra’s Baywatch promo has got a coveted spot at the ongoing Super Bowl half time. The exotic babe decided to live the big moment quite literally, by posing for a ‘Baywatch-ish’ picture this morning. Yes! PC was away for a quick getaway over the weekend and there there….right before taking over the Super Bowl with the kickass Baywatch game, PC tweeted this stunning pic saying, “And she’s looking at you… u… u… Bye bye ocean life… hello NYC… super bowl Sunday here…” Whatta a visual bliss to see Priyanka relaxing by the sea. Indeed, there couldn’t have been a better way to kiss goodbye to our Monday blues. PS: We also love the composition of this pic which naturally has Priyanka lying ahead of her own footprints… It’s like her own success path made onto the sea-shore.( Okay, let’s not get carried away too much by the inspirational vibe coming from the sea) Also read: Priyanka Chopra’s Baywatch promo gets a GAME-ON spot at the Super Bowl Halftime – watch video \nTalking about the Baywatch game, although most of the scenes in the ad are from the trailer itself, the beginning of the promo is quite exciting. Basically, it begins with a voiceover saying, “While you’re watching the game, they’re watching the bay…” Following which, the scene is soon shifted to Dwayne coming out of the water with a lady in his arms and the rest you can check out in the video below. Well, we really think it’s super cool that PeeCee has managed to get such a cool spot in the game.

The Rock captioned the video as, “Who wants mouth to mouth? The iconic #BaywatchSloMoRun. Enjoy our #Baywatch TV spot during the SUPER BOWL! Thank you to my boy and fellow beast @gronk for having some fun! Best of luck in the SUPER BOWL.” \nA video posted by therock (@therock) on Feb 5, 2017 at 4:02pm PST A video posted by Priyanka Chopra (@priyankachopra) on Feb 5, 2017 at 6:24pm PST \nAll said and done, what do you have to say about Priyanka’s above picture?
