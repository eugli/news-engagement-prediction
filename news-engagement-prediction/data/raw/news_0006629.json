Meanwhile, the legal system has once again come calling for the 27-year old Monday. \nThe San Francisco 49ers paid Smith approximately $8.9 million just before the edge rusher was met with a nine-game suspension on Aug. 27, 2016 for violating the league’s substance abuse policy. 49ers sue banished Raiders edge rusher Aldon Smith repayment of forfeited signing bonus https://t.co/p4if9DIiuw pic.twitter.com/IPRxCzHtsa \n— Scott Bair (@BairCSN) January 31, 2017 \nThe disciplinary action means Smith has to pay back over $1.1 million. According to court records, Smith has paid back just over $800,000 of that total.

The 27-year-old has been often troubled Smith in his young adult life. \nThe complaint served as confirmation that the 10 days Smith originally had to appeal were now depleted. The 49ers now are seeking, and have been granted by the court, recuperation not only via cash, but also in attorney’s fees. Which is actually quite common in civil suits.

And this certainly won’t help his case. \nWhether or Smith has the cash to pony up right now, it only seems wise that he meets and speaks with those he needs to ASAP in order to avoid any sort of more impactful life derailment. \nAs for when Oakland will get to see Smith back on the field? That’s an answer that has proven more elusive than Floyd Mayweather in an invisible man suit. \nMore details as they come in. More Latest Raiders News!
