A post shared by Lauren Akins (@laur_akins) on Feb 15, 2017 at 8:15am PST \nWe are so happy to announce that we are pregnant and we are in the process of adopting a child from Africa! Safe to say life is about to get crazy!  { \"position1\" : { \"type\" : \"artist\", \"id\" : 707205, \"name\" : \"Thomas Rhett\" } } \nCongratulations to the soon to be parents! So first, the basics… I’m super tall (5’10”), color blind (which is rare for a girl), I’m extremely clumsy and uncoordinated, and I’m a recent Missouri State graduate that managed to cram 4 years of school into 5 ½. I started in radio as an intern while I was still a student, originally not on air, but somehow managed to convince the right person to put me behind a mic. I have loved music my whole life and used to make my parents drive the long way home so I could listen to the radio for just a few more minutes. When I was little I was true to my Midwestern roots and loved country, especially Shania Twain! Then went through a “rebellious” phase in high school where I was anti-country but listened to pretty much everything else. I credit my boyfriend and Miranda Lambert for bringing my back to a love, bordering on obsession, of country music. He is a country super fan and one of our first dates was at a Miranda concert. Seeing how talented she was live, I was sold! I can typically be found somewhere Downtown, but I also love binge-watching Netflix (particularly anything super nerdy), wakeboarding, dancing, and of course spending time with my family and friends!
