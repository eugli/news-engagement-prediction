Winston Castelo called on the Commission on Higher Education (CHEd) to impose a moratorium on field trips following the accident that left the driver, a teacher and 13 students of Bestlink Colleges of the Philippines dead. \nCommissioner Prospero De Vera on Tuesday also announced the imposition of a moratorium on field trips on all private and public colleges and universities pending the results of the investigation on the accident.

The tours would have no relation at all to their studies ask students to pay exorbitant fees lest they get a failing mark,” Castelo said. \nREAD: Bus crash death toll hits 15; teacher among dead \nFor his part, Iloilo city Rep. Jerry Treñas lamented the absence of an implementing rules and regulations of the Speed Limiter Law, which he authored during the 16th Congress. \nThe congressman said the accident could have been avoided had the Department on Transportation (DOTr) implemented the Republic Act 10916 which lapsed into law in 2016. \nTreñas said the DoTr has not organized a Technical Working Group which would craft the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR). \n“Judging from the damage of the bus, it was obvious that the vehicle was over speeding. Had there been speed limiter on the bus, this kind of senseless accident would not happen,” Treñas said. \n“This should serve as a wake-up call for the DoTr to immediately implement this Speed Limiter Law,” he added. \nRepublic Act 10916 seeks to require the mandatory installation of speed limiter in public utility and certain types of vehicles. \nThe law states that a vehicle would not be registered or given a franchise without the installation of a speed limiter, and that a driver or operator who violates the law may be sentenced to six months to three years imprisonment and a fine of P30,000 with their franchise revoked.
