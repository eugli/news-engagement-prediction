(Michael Schmidt / Pioneer Press) Pioneer Press Staff report \nThe Evanston Police Department didn't have anyone jump into chilly Lake Michigan over the weekend as part of a Special Olympics Illinois fundraiser, but officers pitched in by manning a tent offering support to the event. \n\"Officers Dan Keeler and Marla Dukler came with me to help with getting plungers registered, getting them into the water in an orderly fashion, breaking down the event and then running the after party,\" said Officer Grace Carmichael, a co-chair for the police department's participation in the Law Enforcement Torch Run. \nShe explained that Evanston police chose to stay ashore this year \"simply because there aren't too many people that want to play in the freezing water.\" \nIn all some 350 people — including law enforcement personnel, city or village officials and other community members — took part in the two-day event, officially called the Law Enforcement Torch Run Polar Plunge. \nIt kicked off Friday with a \"super plunge\", where 60 individuals representing police personnel from around the state, including members of the Illinois State Police, jumped into the chilly waters every hour for a 24-hour period. \nThat event alone had a fundraising goal of $200,000, said Special Olympics Illinois spokeswoman Alexandra McMillan. \nThen Saturday, representatives from other North Shore area towns were at the Clark Street Beach in Evanston. \nIn total, the money raised from the Polar Plunge helps the nonprofit organization offer Olympic-style sports events and competitions for thousands of individuals — from youths to adults — who have intellectual disabilities, according to the SOI website. \n\"Special Olympics Illinois recognizes the struggles that many of our athletes and their families face on a daily basis. Building your child's courage, strength and self-esteem should not add to this burden. That is why our programs are provided at no cost to the athletes, their families or caregivers,\" said Sandy Nash, director of the Law Enforcement Torch Run. \nAnd Carmichael said that, though the Evanston Police department didn't fundraise for the event collectively, police personnel donated to individual plungers — as the participants are called. \n\"Being involved in all of the Torch Run events is an honor for us,\" Carmichael said of EPD's participation. \"Being able to raise money for our athletes and put on events where they can come out and speak about their involvement in Special Olympics Illinois and what it means to them is a great privilege.\" \nSOI officials have planned this year to host a total of 22 plunge events around the state, starting with the Feb. 17 kickoff through March 19. \nEach plunger has been asked to raise a minimum of $100 each, officials said. \n\"The funds raised through the Super Plunge and the other 22 plunges taking place in Illinois are essential to the success of our athletes and programs,\" Nash said. \"Ultimately, the funds raised by our warm-hearted SUPER Plungers and Plungers help to provide our athletes with … opportunities.\" \nProceeds are used to help coach, train and provide other support to participants who may compete in the statewide Special Olympics, SOI officials said. \nThis year's tournament will be held in down state Bloomington in June, officials said. \nSOI officials said that over 22,000 athletes statewide compete in the Special Olympics Illinois, and the organization offers 180 competitions throughout the year. \n\"At the end of the day, being of service to our community is important and necessary, and we all feel a special connection with our [Special Olympics] athletes, and love being able to help raise funds for their athletic endeavors,\" Carmichael said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:22:51.812+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
