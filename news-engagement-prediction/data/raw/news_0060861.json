You Don't Own Us! 2/24/2017 8:51 AM PST EXCLUSIVE \nAmber Rose and her mouth went too far when it comes to one of L.A.'s most famous strip clubs ... according to a lawsuit filed by the owners of Ace of Diamonds . \nAmber bragged to the audience at the All Def Movie Awards Wednesday night that she'd bought AoD. The crowd -- clearly fans of the club's fine product -- cheered wildly, and Amber's purchase was reported by multiple media outlets. \nBut the owners of AoD -- SKWS Enterprises -- say Amber hasn't put a dime into ownership of the club. They say her comment is \"unequivocally false\" and they haven't sold to anyone. \nThey're suing Amber for slander, and looking for more than a million bucks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T19:09:28.611+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
