Punctuated by a single bamboo customs house at one end, the whole thing is small by aviation standards—perhaps about a half-mile long—and its obsidian tarmac doesn’t even appear until your propeller plane practically grazes the island’s lush emerald treetops. Given the number of elite jet-setters who’ve passed time on the island—celebrities, royalty, all sorts of privacy-seekers—you can’t help but think to yourself, “Wow, I wonder if Kate Moss was as terrified as I am to land here.” At one point or another, Mustique has drawn in the likes of: Moss, David Bowie , Jude Law, Johnny Depp, Mick Jagger, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge . Once you’ve braved the short connecting flight from Barbados or St. Lucia, you are treated to a geological gem of an island. At just over two square miles, Mustique is one of the larger Grenadines, where tranquil Caribbean tides rest on one side and breezy Atlantic waves ebb on the other. Whereas many Caribbean isles are largely flat and arid, Mustique is hilly, with a rolling landscape enveloped by verdant tropical forest. Aromatic frangipani and bougainvillea flowers thrive, as do palm trees. And since most of the barely paved, meandering roads are canopied with lush overgrowth, there is always the sense on Mustique that discovery (or a Middleton, or perhaps a Delevingne) looms around every corner. It was a sense of adventure, after all, that led Colin Tennant, Lord Glenconner, to purchase the island for 45,000 pounds (around $57,000) in 1958, eventually creating a paradise far away from London’s chilly weather and even chillier social norms. One of the first things he did with his little island was a grand gesture of friendship or, as it would come to be, one of the greatest real estate marketing moves of all time: On the occasion of her wedding, Tennant gifted one of the best-situated, more secluded, more scenic parcels to HRH Princess Margaret. Upon that land she built Les Jolies Eaux, a magnificent five-bedroom villa designed by iconic English stage designer Oliver Messel. The island proved to be a marvelous escape for Princess Margaret. As anyone familiar with The Crown can attest, Queen Elizabeth II’s younger sister always had a penchant for standing out: Apparently at the age of 17, she caused a sensation by smoking publicly; she carried on an extended affair with divorcé Peter Townsend; and she eventually went on to marry photographer Lord Snowdon. Over the decades she vacationed there, Mustique came to signify for Margaret the peace, quiet, and privacy that she could never find at home. There were reportedly cocktails that would start at sunset and last until dawn, reports of wild parties alongside Mick and Bianca Jagger, and more rumored affairs than any royal historian could possibly keep tabs on. As one former employee of The Mustique Company confidentially told us, “Macaroni Beach on the east of the island was her place. And everyone knew: What happened on Macaroni Beach stayed on Macaroni Beach.” The oral history of Mustique is a panoply of such rumors, stories, and legends that the island has earned the only half-true reputation for being an exceedingly private destination where only the world’s elite are allowed. On the contrary, of the roughly 100 villas on the island, about 80 of them are available for rent (including HRH’s former villa) through Mustique-Island.com. And because The Mustique Corporation goes to such extensive lengths to preserve the island, the character of this place has remained largely untouched since the days of Princess Margaret. So go ahead, spoil yourself with a trip down to the Grenadines—it could very well be your best chance at living like a royal for a week or two. How to Get There The Mustique Company offers scheduled charters that operate 18-seat Twin Otters, which connect with St. Lucia (30 minutes away) and Barbados (45 minutes). Aside from the tiny runway, it’s a painless flight—and being on a propeller plane is a charming nod to the glory days of Caribbean travel. Where to Stay The villas of Mustique are known for architectural excellence and diversity, with something catering to every taste. Marguerite , one of the newer villas, sits atop one of the island’s hills, and is a sprawling testament to the luxury of minimalist modernism. Good-for-groups Jacaranda is located on northern L’Ansecoy Bay, just a few doors down from Mick Jagger’s home—you can perhaps invite him over for sunset drinks on the beach. Overlooking L’Ansecoy Bay from the east is Frangipani , a resplendent home on four acres of manicured gardens, featuring a 60-foot swimming pool that watches over the confluence of the Caribbean and Atlantic. If water views are what you’re after, consider The Beach House , built into the side of a cliff with its own private funicular down to the pavilion, with unparalleled views of Gelliceaux Bay. But if it’s The Crown vibes you’re after, the only choice is HRH’s former residence Les Jolies Eaux . Each villa’s rental typically comes with a private chef and a small staff. The Cotton House is really the island’s only hotel to speak of, and is ideal for couples or for people who can’t spend a whole week on the island. A recently-finished renovation by Tristan Auer—the brains behind London’s Chiltern Firehouse—has restored this former sugar plantation to its glory: dark-varnished wood floors, rattan furniture, slow-turning fans to keep the air moving, and attentive staff who cater to your every need. Lunch at The Cotton House’s Beach Café and dinner at the Veranda Restaurant are equally flawless (both serve fresh takes on Caribbean cuisine, make sure to try the catch of the day and Veranda Restaurant’s pineapple crumble for dessert). What to do The beauty of Mustique is that there really isn’t much to do. The staff of your villa can happily arrange some tennis time, maybe a boat excursion or horseback ride, but each villa on the island is such a delight that the best thing to do is ask your chef for a rum punch, lay out on a chaise, and soak up the sun. If you’re feeling adventurous, there is a teeny spot of shopping to be done on the island— Pink House and Purple House, conveniently located next door to each other overlooking Britannia Bay, offer swimsuits, souvenir shells, and the like. When it comes to nightlife, however, the fast and loose out-all-night mentality that drew Princess Margaret to Mustique is still alive and well. Start with sunset drinks at the bar at the Firefly Hotel Mustique (have the dark and stormy), then head down the hill to Basil’s Bar , a waterfront dive on Britannia Bay that during its decades-long history has hosted some of Mustique’s rowdiest late nights. And if you think its owner, Basil Charles, is just another Caribbean bar owner, blowing smoke about all the things he’s seen and all his epic nights partying with Princess Margaret, consider this: Mr. Charles himself was one of the guests of honor at the royal wedding in 2011. Since her passing in 2002, HRH has been sorely missed on the island, but whispers of stories and traces of her presence can still be felt everywhere—and if you’re lucky enough to make the trip down to Mustique, you could very well see Pippa Middleton dancing the limbo at Basil’s Bar, or the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge enjoying a sunset stroll on Macaroni Beach.
