Cash Also Helps. Rikha Sharma Rani Photo DeVone Boggan, of Operation Peacemaker Fellowship. Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times Richmond, Calif. — DeVone Boggan could teach a class on the art of making a statement. In 2010, he invited a group of the most dangerous gun offenders in Richmond, a Bay Area city of about 100,000 residents, to a conference room at City Hall. At each seat was a name card starting with “Mr.” and an information folder labeled “Operation Peacemaker.” Wearing a suit and his signature fedora, Boggan began the meeting by apologizing on behalf of the city for not reaching out to the men sooner. Peace in Richmond, he told them, must come through them. When the meeting was over and everyone got up to leave, Boggan called them back. The men, already wary, assumed they would be arrested. Instead, Boggan handed each an envelope containing $1,000. “We wanted to send sound waves through the community,” Boggan said. “Facebook blew up.” The previous year, Richmond police department officials had told Boggan, the director of the city’s Office of Neighborhood Safety, that they thought 17 men were responsible for 70 percent of the city’s gun crime. At the time, Richmond was among the most dangerous cities in the country. Its homicide rate had reached 46 per 100,000 residents — triple Chicago’s rate. At one point, the City Council had even considered declaring a state of emergency. Boggan asked each official to independently send him the names of the 17 men, an exercise that yielded 28 unduplicated names. In the three months it took to make contact with all of them, three died of gun related injuries. He invited the remaining 25 to City Hall, and 21 showed up. Boggan is the architect of Operation Peacemaker Fellowship, a controversial program initiated in 2010 that shares features with Cure Violence and Ceasefire, two other programs that, over the last two decades, have become models for reducing gun violence. Like the others, Boggan’s method uses data and intelligence to identify people highly likely to commit or become victims of gun violence; it then connects them with job training, mentorship and social services while deploying outreach teams to intervene in conflicts. But it also does something else. After six months, its subjects — most are African-American males between 14 and 27 years old — are eligible for a monthly cash stipend of up to $1,000 for up to nine months (Boggan’s meeting in 2010 with the first cohort was played out in a way designed to turn heads and attract more fellows into the program). The city’s average homicide rate in the five years that preceded the arrival of Operation Peacemaker was 40 per 100,000 residents. In the next five years, it dropped by nearly 60 percent. Continue reading the main story Modeled after Cure Violence, the Richmond program treats gun violence as an epidemic disease that spreads by exposure to it. What’s notable about the approach is that, unlike Ceasefire and other focused deterrence strategies administered by police, the Office of Neighborhood Safety does not threaten punishment if fellows don’t comply. “There are only three ways out,” Boggan said. “They choose to leave, they’re arrested, or they’re killed.” The office also maintains a firewall between it and law enforcement and doesn’t share with the police intelligence it has gathered about fellows — including reports of continued firearm activity. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story For one 29-year-old former fellow, LaVon Carter Jr., that element was critical. “When I knew they weren’t the police, that’s when they gained my trust,” he said. “I can’t be talking to you about stuff that I did and exposing this and that and you’re the police. That don’t work.” Carter became a fellow soon after his release from a five-year prison term. He had heard about the program while incarcerated. Like all fellows, he was recruited because the neighborhood safety agency’s outreach team, which is composed largely of streetwise former felons turned “neighborhood change agents,” had determined that, once out of prison, there was a high likelihood of Carter shooting someone, or being shot himself, within the next six to 12 months. At a time when algorithms are increasingly being used to predict the likelihood of future criminality, Richmond’s Office of Neighborhood Safety selects fellows based almost entirely on old-fashioned street intelligence. Its ”change agents” regularly engage with young people from the city's toughest neighborhoods. They get to know where prospective fellows live and work, whom they spend their time with, who their enemies are, what their family life is like, and what interactions they’ve had with rival gangs and with law enforcement.

Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times That timely on-the-ground knowledge enables the change agents to build a psychology-based profile of each prospective fellow and assess who are most likely to be involved in gun violence. There have been four Peacemaker cohorts to date, and a total of 93 people have been invited into the program. Of those, 84 have accepted. As of January, the program had a dropout rate of zero. “The money is the bait,” Carter said. “It all starts off about the money, and then once you get involved with it and start being around these people, meeting all these people that you would have never been exposed to, it opens your eyes to a bigger picture.” Fellows have traveled to Washington, D.C., South Africa, Mexico and Disneyland. Boggan describes seeing “one of the baddest dudes around” wearing Mickey Mouse ears. Fellows are also invited to meet with prominent members of the community, including top corporate executives and members of Congress. “I’d never been around people like that before,” Carter said. “Through my whole stint in prison, everything that I was thinking about was illegal; how I was gonna get out and get money … now I work ten hours a day. I’m a heavy equipment operator. I never thought I’d be out here driving Tonka toys for real.” Fellows are also connected to a “council of elders” — older African-American men who serve as mentors and role models — and attend weekly classes to help them develop social and emotional skills like conflict negotiation and anger management.
