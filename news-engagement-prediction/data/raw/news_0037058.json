Â© Kyodo \nSINGAPORE -- Though the murder of Kim Jong Nam, half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, was initially considered a hit by Pyongyang, the arrest of two women and the secretive attitude of the Malaysian government have sown confusion over what really transpired at Kuala Lumpur's airport on Monday. \nThe cause of death will be announced by the police, Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Zahid Hamidi told reporters Thursday. He said that talk of North Korea's involvement was just \"speculation.\" \nHe took no questions from reporters at the government's first news conference since the death. The police have also kept their silence. Amid a lack of official information, local media have reported on various theories regarding the attackers and their relationship. \nAs of Friday, Malaysian authorities had detained a woman with a Vietnamese passport and another with an Indonesian passport, as well as a Malaysian man. The women were responsible for poisoning Kim at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, according to local reports. The police investigated the scene of the crime on Friday with the two in tow. Some sources said two women and four men were seen conducting a dry run at the airport the day before the murder. \nKim's autopsy was completed on Wednesday, according to Malaysian state news agency Bernama. He is said to have been killed by a highly toxic nerve agent, but no official announcement has been made. \nOpinions are divided on who the attackers were and why they targeted Kim. An early theory was that a foreign spy agency had plotted the murder. Others claimed that the women were paid to kill Kim, given that one of them was detained near the scene -- a rookie mistake if she were an actual spy. \nSome now speculate that the women were tricked. One of them told the police that she was paid to film a prank video of her spraying liquid on Kim, according to Malaysian news outlet China Press. Police are said to be hunting down several other men, who could hold the key to the truth. \nThe lack of explanation from the Malaysian government has added to the confusion. Kim's body is expected to be handed to North Korea soon. The move will likely strengthen Malaysia's diplomatic relations with the North, Zahid said. \nThis reluctance to share information is said to be a courtesy to North Korea, which hopes to put a quick end to the incident. The two countries have diplomatic ties but limited economic ones, raising questions over whether Malaysia is right to show so much concern for Pyongyang. \nAnother possibility is that Malaysia wants to turn the focus away from its own security issues. Not only was it unable to prevent a murder at an international airport in its capital city, but Kim was preparing to leave the country under a fake name. \nMalaysia hopes to turn the Kuala Lumpur airport into an Asian hub. But if Kim is determined to have been the target of an assassination, there will be concerns about the country's security apparatus as a whole. It may be trying to pull the curtains on the situation before the scrutiny reaches a fever pitch.
