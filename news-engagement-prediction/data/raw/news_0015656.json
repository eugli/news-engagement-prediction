Oakley not only has the support of a great many Knicks fans, he has the support of stars LeBron James , Dwyane Wade and Chris Paul . The three of them, all close friends with New York star Carmelo Anthony , expressed their displeasure with Oakley being ejected from Madison Square Garden and arrested on Wednesday . \nPaul took issue with the rude and condescending way the Knicks' publicly encouraged Oakley to \"get some help.\" Hope that he gets some help soon?
