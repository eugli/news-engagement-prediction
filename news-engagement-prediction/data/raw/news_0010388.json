Lisa Murkowski told CNN. “I don’t see how you can get a bill like that through [Congress] without offsets. I don’t see how that’s possible.” \nGet on the same page, people. \nStop trying to please the left. They aren’t trying to please you! \nTrump’s wall would cost anywhere from $12-$14 billion to construct. \nIllegal immigration costs the American taxpayer over $100 billion. \nWhat’s the problem?
