That month at the tail end of Winter, nestled distressingly after a January of failed new year's resolutions and wasted gym memberships. But since the birth of LGBT History month in 2005, the month has become jammed with incredible stuff to do, see, and talk about. \nLGBT History month is a month for LGBT people to be, and feel, recognised. Observed annually in the UK every February, the celebration started back to coincide with the anniversary of the abolition of the heinous anti-gay Section 28. All across the country, events are organised to unite the LGBT community, to teach us about our history, and to make a statement of reminder that the LGBT community have, and continue to contribute to society in so many marvellous ways.
