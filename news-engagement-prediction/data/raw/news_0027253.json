There are at least two more movies on the way and now that we know that licensed properties work when it comes to these films, we expect we'll be seeing even more of them going forward. \nThe LEGO toy brand has numerous deals to create toys based on all sorts of franchises. As such, they've already built a number of opportunities for tie-in films. While we're sure that there would be numerous hoops to jump through when it comes to licensing deals between other studios as well as LEGO themselves, that doesn't stop us from wanting. Here's a few that we'd love to see. Harry Potter \nThis one seems incredibly obvious. The Harry Potter film franchise is owned by Warner Bros., as is the LEGO film franchise. This means that putting the two together would be potentially easier to put together than most other options. We saw Voldemort take a significant role in The LEGO Batman Movie , not unlike what Batman did in the original LEGO Movie . Maybe that means we'll be seeing him again in a future spinoff of his own. J.K. Rowling appears to have a solid sense of humor, so we can't imagine she'd have a problem with having a bit of fun with her beloved characters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T04:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:02:29.720+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
