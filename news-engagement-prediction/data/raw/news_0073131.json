It is why Paul Pogba's departure so upset Gianluigi Buffon, but even after the Frenchman moved to Manchester, Bonucci rejected further attempts to lure him away from the Old Lady.\nFast-forward six months, however, and his future in Turin has been plunged into serious doubt after a robust argument with coach Massimiliano Allegri - who was overheard screaming \"shut up, dickhead. F**k off\" at the defender - during and after Juventus' win over Palermo.\nIt is far from the first time a player has fallen out with Allegri but the former AC Milan coach has taken an especially hard line with the 29-year-old for questioning his authority and is expected to leave him in the stands for Wednesday night's Champions League clash at Porto. \nAntonio Conte knows Bonucci well from his time with Italy and Juventus ( Getty Images) Chelsea, who had already made Bonucci their top target for the summer, have been encouraged by the latest developments and club owner Roman Abramovich is willing to sanction a world-record transfer fee for the defender in order to secure his new coach, who looks set to win him a Premier League title during his first campaign on English soil, his priority signing. Conte, of course, knows Bonucci well from his time as coach of Juventus and then Italy. \nManchester City, who attempted to completely overhaul the heart of their defence with deals for Aymeric Laporte and John Stones last summer, only for an agreement with the Frenchman to fall flat, pursued Bonucci and will do so again in the coming months. \nRead more Conte sets sights on the double but remains evasive on Terry's future The pursuit of happiness? Not for Chelsea's Conte Costa poised to become Chelsea's highest-earner Those around Juventus insist the club is in \"win-now mode\", as evidenced by the signing of ageing-but-effective pair Dani Alves and Gonzalo Higuain in the summer. They have no desire to part with Bonucci as things stand.\nBut should they win the Champions League or - as is becoming evermore likely - decide to re-boot in the off-season, with reports in Italy suggesting they have contacted Diego Simeone over replacing the increasingly distant Allegri, then Bonucci's camp believe they will be able to leave the club in an amicable manner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:35:42.530+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
