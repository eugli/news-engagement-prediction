Peter Dazeley/Getty By Lydia Nicholas \nAT THE 2010 TechCrunch conference, Eric Schmidt, then CEO of Google, described his ambition for the company. It would, he said, collect and analyse data about its users until “we know more or less what you are thinking about”. This would offer a “new future [in which] you’re never lost… never lonely… never bored… never out of ideas”. \nRecent years have seen not just more data of more kinds being produced, but a fundamental shift in our experience of the world: our news, entertainment, routes home, products and potential romantic partners are data-driven: evolving in real time, and wrapping us in personalised market segments of one. \nThese services are enormously convenient. The idle thoughts and urgent worries we express in searches are autocompleted and autocorrected; information, products and opportunities tailored to our interests surround us. But questions about the effects of letting commercial services in on our most critical and intimate choices are growing ever louder and more urgent . Advertisement \nIn Data for the People , Andreas Weigend, former chief scientist at Amazon and consultant to a host of data-driven businesses, sets out to explain how many of these technologies work, how companies profit from them, and the ways in which he believes the balance of power needs to be shifted back in favour of users . \nIt is a hugely interesting read, packed to bursting with intriguing examples. We learn how our attention can be tracked as we consume content, how depression impacts our use of devices, about the different ways dating sites try to unpick what we really want and connect us most effectively, and how the unique quirks in the ways we swipe and tap our phones can be used to track us across devices. \nThe depth and breadth of Weigend’s experience is clear in the sheer range of technologies and business models he describes. He explains critical concepts clearly and concisely, at a pace that should keep both experts and those new to the field hooked. \nBut his examples are no mere abstractions. With such services reshaping our lives and society, Weigend chooses to describe not only the current world but also his hopes for a better one. He sets out a series of rights, demanding that data-driven businesses be more transparent and grant users more agency over what data is collected and how it is used. “Weigend expresses shock at discovering a file kept on him as a teenager in East Germany” \nMany chapters end with stirring words – calls for a social data revolution, for consumers to take a stand and demand more power – but there is little real force behind the rhetoric. For the most part, Weigend appears to believe that companies will voluntarily comply with his demands because doing so would drive both efficiency and innovation in the long term. \nThe data utopianism begins to grate as this argument develops. Sections on optimising shift work make no mention of the potential impact on workers of unpredictable hours, or of them being constantly monitored . In one instance, Weigend cites analysis of sociometric data in the workplace – covering staff movements, whom they speak to and in what tone, plus when groups nod in agreement – and tests show that teams who took breaks together were 25 per cent more efficient. One wonders what the impact of treating them with care and respect might be. \nWeigend makes clear that he is aware of the power of data, how those in power hunger for it, and the potential for abusing it. His prologue is unnerving, opening with a description of his father being seized by the Stasi in East Germany and languishing for six long years in solitary confinement, never learning why he was arrested or released. And Weigend’s shock at discovering a file kept on him as a teenager may be matched by our own when he explains that at the time East Germany collapsed, fully 1 per cent of the workforce was employed by the secret police. \nBut the solutions are lightly sketched. We are offered a future of hacker-auditors giving companies regular security checks, and of regulatory bodies subjecting mega corporations to privacy audits that detail how much benefit users gain in exchange for sharing their data. \nIt may be unfair to judge a book by events that unfolded after reviewers received their copies. A year ago, Weigend’s ideas might have felt sufficient to justify the bold title and rhetoric. But recent events have made the situation more urgent, bringing concerns long expressed by academics and technologists to the public eye. \nWe have seen a frantic surge in interest across the political spectrum in how data-driven businesses are reshaping, even undermining democracy by filtering our access to information in personalised newsfeeds and cutting us off from opposing views, thus undermining attempts to collaborate and compromise. And concerns are surfacing about how data collected for convenient apps might be repurposed: many of the companies mentioned in the book have stated publicly that they would not collaborate in attempts to create a so-called Muslim registry. \nWeigend’s crisp description of the mechanisms Google uses to rank its search results was written before the search giant rushed through a fix to its algorithm so that the top result for the query “did the Holocaust happen?” was no longer a link to a Nazi group that denies it. The move was interpreted by many as frank recognition on the data broker’s part of its responsibility for the accuracy and impact of its services. Ranking pages according to how much attention they receive, no matter how sophisticated the analysis, is no longer good enough. “Google rushed through a fix so the top answer to a Holocaust query was no longer a Nazi denier group” \nIn such a context, Data for the People ‘s neutral, optimistic stance feels unsatisfying, rendered immediately dated by developments beyond the author’s control. \nOther omissions are less forgivable. In a book that delights in rich explanations, it is jarring to see “redlining” described as “treating applicants differently based on where they live” rather than what it was: a state-sanctioned effort to destroy investment opportunities in black communities by declaring areas where black people lived ineligible for mortgage underwriting by the Federal Housing Administration. \nElsewhere we find straightforward cop-outs. A section on how market segments are named, for example, hints that many of those labels were “even worse” stereotypes than “suburban soccer moms”. Surely a book setting out to motivate readers to fight for transparency would give us examples of these labels? \nBut Data for the People motivates and provokes thought even as it disturbs and frustrates. Technologies that uncover our emotional state might, Weigend is willing to acknowledge, be used unethically in first dates or job interviews, yet the reader is very capable of extrapolating more. “What sort of world do we want to create with this new resource?” Weigend asks. \nWhat sort of world, indeed. \nThis article appeared in print under the headline “A digital reckoning” \nMore on these topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T12:23:49.907+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
