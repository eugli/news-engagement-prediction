(Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk) \nPorn is that age-old subject that seems to endlessly divide people – most notably women. \nSome call it misogynistic and out-dated, others can’t get enough of it. \nMyself? I love a bit of porn. \nAnd not your ‘feminised’ version either, but your bog standard, easily available, Red Tube smut. \nIt turns me on — both with a partner and on my own. \nThere is still a stigma attached to women watching porn, with much of the criticism aimed at the banal narratives of your average skin flick – we’re ‘supposed’ to enjoy things which are more mentally arousing. \nLess immediate tits and ass and more of a story, with relatable characters. \nYou only have to look at the success of Fifty Shades Of Grey to understand what society deems as acceptable ‘porn’ for women to enjoy today. \nNot on my watch. \nGive me some old-school wham-bam hardcore filth any day of the week. Although not all of us look this sexy while watching porn (Picture: Getty) \nSure it’s not exactly highbrow, and fairly inaccurate in its portrayal of your average person’s sex life, but there are a growing number of women who enjoy ‘basic’ porn, and, perhaps more importantly, a growing number of women who aren’t afraid to admit it either. \nIf I want a storyline I’ll watch Netflix, if I want to watch two people f**king each other, I’ll watch porn. \nMake no mistake, I wouldn’t factor a two-hour porn session into my daily itinerary. \nI’m what you would call a recreational user – and I take it with a pinch of salt.
