Umpire Scott Jeffrey sets the ball up for Brodie Grundy and Rhys Stanley.

For them, though, the physical and mental challenges the skill presents every week supersedes its tradition and aesthetics. \n“We talk about tradition — and I love tradition as well … but I don’t think the bounce is as important as what people think it is,” former AFL umpire Jordan Bannister told RSN on Wednesday. \nHere’s why the bounce goes beyond tradition. \nTHE MENTAL TOLL \nJUST like players, umpires are heavily scrutinised during games, not only by fans but by their own coaches and on-lookers. \nEach official’s performance is carefully graded, with every decision, running pattern and bounce marked by an observer. \nAt VFL/TAC Cup level, every umpire’s game is marked out of 120 points, with bouncing making up 10 points of the final score. On paper it doesn’t sound like a significant amount, but a few bad bounces could not only be costly on the post-game report card, but also mess with an umpire’s in-game mental state and hinder their hopes of umpiring at a higher level. \n“Two bad bounces is worth the same as two bad decisions,” a former state league umpire told foxfooty.com.au . \n“If you’re not as strong at bouncing and lose three to four points some games, you’re instantly behind every game. At the end of the season, every point counts.” \nThe ex-umpire, who gave up on their AFL dream at the end of the 2015 season, said he always looked forward to officiating games in the rain, as it meant they didn’t have to bounce the ball. \n“Like a player taking set-shots, one miss can stay in your mind for a while, distract you from other things and change psychology for upcoming bounces,” they said. The bounce, demonstrated here by umpire Luke Farmer, puts a lot of strain on an umpire’s back and hamstrings.

If you miss a few bounces, usually it affects your decision-making,” he said. \n“It’s just really embarrassing. If you have a re-call in the middle of 80,000 people, it’s not the greatest feeling you’ll ever have in the world.” \nTHE INJURY TOLL \nTHE art of the bounce is not only difficult to execute, but can be very taxing on the body. \nJust ask AFL life member and bounce-scrapper advocate Michael Vozzo, who officiated in 281 games across, including 24 finals and the 2006 and 2008 Grand Finals. \nVozzo said when he was young, he used to have bouncing competitions against his mates. \n“We used to slam the crap out of the ball,” Vozzo told foxfooty.com.au . \nBut the slamming sessions quickly took their toll on Vozzo, who said he started having back problems during his late teenage years. \nAnd those issues didn’t ease during his AFL career — a time when bouncing was required more frequently on game day. \n“Around 95 per cent of my physio was on my back. For me, it was a week-to-week thing to make sure I got my back right for every game,” he said. \n“There was a lot of anti-inflammatories and a lot of injections. I remember coming out of the doctors once after an injection and I couldn’t feel my legs.” \nVozzo added that he did have some hamstring issues, while he encountered some shoulder issues during the latter stages of his career and post-retirement. \nAFL umpires coach Kennedy, who umpired a record 495 VFL/AFL games, said hamstring issues forced him into retirement.

Source: Getty Images \nKennedy said the centre bounce is seen as a major contributor to umpire injuries, due to the amount of practice that’s needed to master the art. \n“To get that skill right, it’s a really demanding and dynamic movement,” Kennedy told 3AW . \n“We have got an older list, so to do it for 15 or 20 years, and at the community level beforehand, it takes a fair toll on the body.” \nAt the highest level, Bannister was told that he could only practice 20 to 30 bounces per day because of the strain it placed on umpires’ backs and hamstrings. \n“You can’t do 1000 and just perfect it, you can’t practice more,” Bannister said. \n“That’s why it’s such a confidence thing.” \nAfter joining a state level list, the ex-umpire said plant-leg bouncing was more likely to produce hamstring soreness “because of the constant over-extension”. \n“I tore my left hamstring doing sprints two years in,” they said. \n“I never had hamstring issues prior to the state league and now even years later I still have trouble on my bouncing leg.” \nTHE PATHWAY ISSUE \nAFTER announcing his retirement from AFL umpiring, Vozzo moved to the Eastern Football League to take up a head of umpiring role. \nWhile Vozzo was aware that umpires weren’t required to bounce at local level, it didn’t strike him until he began identifying talented community umpires how tough it would be for aspiring AFL officiators. \n“It’s something I didn’t really notice until I got to Eastern (Football League),” Vozzo said. \n“In local footy, you’re not allowed to bounce the ball. So for any prospective umpire with the talent to go further, some mightn’t know how to bounce until they get to the VFL. \n“Some guys might be umpiring at local level for four to five years then they get to the VFL and have got to nail it straight away.” \nIn an attempt to provide a smoother transition from local to state level, Vozzo took some of the top-class EFL umpires aside and conducted bouncing lessons separate to the league’s training program. \nWhile some found the lessons beneficial, others had their “confidence rocked”, according to Vozzo. \n“One of the kids even pulled the pin on umpiring after that,” he said. \nIt’s an issue Kennedy has identified as well, hence why he’s pushing for the ball to be thrown up at all times at AFL level. Jordan Bannister announced his retirement from AFL umpiring in February.

No doubt about it,” the umpire said. \n“Yes my umpiring had areas to improve, but the bounce was my biggest weakness.” \nOn another level, Bannister said scrapping the bounce could increase the likelihood of ex-players turning to umpiring — a transition the AFL is keen to increase following the success of Bannister and former Saint Leigh Fisher at senior level. \n“A lot of the players I’ve talked to over the past seven years, the first question they ask about is the bounce and how hard it is. You can tell that’s a real turn-off straight away,” Bannister said. \n“We have so many good decision-makers who don’t get a game each week, or who get cut from the list because they can’t bounce. But we’ve got guys who bounce like a magician that are getting a game every week but they’re poor decision-makers. \n“What people should realise is that decision-making comes first. It’s great if people can do both, but (decision-making) is probably what we should prioritise first.” View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
