It had been years since our entire family had lived under the same roof for such a long period of time. We were in a house in the middle of nowhere and we were in that house for a couple of weeks,\" Joy explained as her eyes watered. \"Between telling stories and laughing and crying and sharing a few daddy moments, Jesse would go out and play his guitar by the pool and the ocean and he just came in and said, 'This melody reminds me of dad.' So we just started writing around that and just writing it we were crying our eyes out.\" A video posted by Jesse & Joy (@jesseyjoy) on Feb 12, 2017 at 12:57pm PST \n\"We're on the way to the red carpet to the Grammys.
