The Hold On singer was caught on camera entering the swish Italian restaurant San Carlo last night with an entourage of around ten people. \nEn route to one of the restaurant's private booths, Drake is seen pausing for a second as he takes down his hood, at which point diners start squealing as they recognise the world-famous musician. \nOther diners were a little more relaxed about his appearance, tweeting \"When your sat scranning your pizza in San Carlo Manchester and Drake walks in.\" \nAn insider from the King Street West restaurant confirmed the sighting, saying that Drake arrived late last night, and was a very laid-back customer. \nIt's the second time that Drake has been spotted partying in Manchester recently. On Wednesday night Drake booked out the entire Zouk tea bar and grill on Manchester’s Chester Street to party with his crew and pals after his gig at Leeds’ First Direct Arena.
