'Exciting' \nWriting in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , scientists from the University of Utah said the compound appeared to have a beneficial effect on parts of the nervous system. \nAnd this could open the door to new opportunities to treat pain, they said. \nThey said drugs that worked in this way could reduce the use of opioids, such as morphine, which are addictive and can cause a number of serious side-effects. \nJ Michael McIntosh, professor of psychiatry at the University of Utah Health Sciences, said: \"What is particularly exciting about these results is the aspect of prevention. \n\"Once chronic pain has developed, it is difficult to treat,\" he said. \n\"This compound offers a potential new pathway to prevent pain from developing in the first place and offer a new therapy to patients who have run out of options.\" \nIn tests on rats, scientists found that those animals treated with a chemotherapy drug that caused them to be hypersensitive to cold and touch, experienced pain - but those also treated with the snail compound did not. \n\"We found that the compound was still working 72 hours after the injection, still preventing pain,\" Prof McIntosh said.
