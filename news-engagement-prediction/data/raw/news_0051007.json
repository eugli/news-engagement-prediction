What he didn't know was how much history he'd make himself. \nJohnson, a leader of a first-year program at Aurora Christian, completed an undefeated freshman season Saturday by winning the Class 1A 106-pound championship 3-0 over Bishop McNamara's Pauley Keane at the State Farm Center. \n\"I've never won a state title at any level before and I've been wrestling since I was 5 years old,\" Johnson said. \"It's a dream come true. I was working hard all year long wanting to accomplish this one goal. \n\"I didn't know if I was going to be undefeated, but I knew I had a chance to do anything, because anything's possible.\" \nJohnson (35-0) got an early takedown and shut down Keane (28-4) down from there. \n\"I knew if I had an early lead and got that first takedown that I'd be able to control the match because that's when I just go to work,\" Johnson said. \nAll three wrestlers Aurora Christian sent to state, each of them freshmen, came away as medalists. \nNoah Villareal (33-4) finished second at 120, falling 11-5 to Fulton's Tyler Fleetwood in the finals. Zeke Marshall (31-4) took fifth at 113. \n\"There's a lot of people that'll come up and ask about us,\" Johnson said. \"I have to explain that we just started this program up this year. I think we showed that the work ethic in our room really gets the job done.\" \nWaubonsie Valley's Mason Kroening (195) and Marmion's Nate Jimenez (160) had runner-up finishes in 3A. \nKroening (37-3) had a big 6-2 semifinal win over Downers Grove South's Sergio Villalobos before falling 12-4 to Sandburg's Patrick Brucki in the finals. \n\"Being able to represent Waubonsie and our area in the finals was an honor,\" Kroening said. \"Brucki is a great opponent. All props to him.\" \nJimenez (39-7) dropped a heartbreaking championship match 3-2 to Lockport's Trevell Timmons, giving up a takedown with 21 seconds left. \n\"This is probably the worst feeling in the world,\" Jimenez said. \"It's something that's definitely going to motivate me for next year. That's a process that begins now.\" \nMarmion had five medalists, including third-place finishers Anthony Cheloni (138) and Brad Gross (152), fourth-place Trevor Chumbley (126) and fifth-place Peter Ferraro (170). \nCheloni (48-6) finished his career in memorable fashion, pinning Reavis' Jimmy McAuliffe in the third-place match. \n\"It's awesome,\" Cheloni said. \"It's the best feeling in the world to end your career like that.\" \nKaneland produced five medalists in 2A, led by Riley Vanik's third-place finish at 182. \n\"It was great to do this with my teammates,\" Vanik said. \"It's the most medalists we've ever had. It's so nice.\" \nKaneland's Austin Kedzie (120) and Colin Gussman (220) finished fourth, while Nathan Orosco (106) and Hayden Patterson (170) placed sixth. \nWaubonsie's Nick Sondag (3A, 220) finished fifth. \nSteve Millar is a freelance writer for The Beacon-News.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T06:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T01:33:27.546+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
