Bayonne officials to meet with Port Authority to discuss ferry plan ferry.jpg Bayonne officials will meet with the Port Authority on Friday to discuss the implementation of a commuter ferry from the Military Ocean Terminal to Manhattan, officials said. (EJA) comments \nBAYONNE -- City officials have taken another step toward bringing a commuter ferry to the city. \nBayonne and Port Authority officials are scheduled to meet Friday to discuss plans for the ferry route to Manhattan, city Business Administrator Joe DeMarco said. \n\"This is something we've been working on for the past two years with the Port Authority -- trying to get this done,\" Mayor Jimmy Davis said. \"So now we'll know all of the parameters (of the commuter ferry) on Friday.\" \nPort Authority spokesman Steve Coleman would not go that far, only saying that the bi-state agency is meeting with Bayonne officials to talk about their proposal. \nThe ferry station would likely be placed on the southern coast of the former Military Ocean Terminal (MOT), roughly a half-mile east of the Harbor Pointe apartment buildings, DeMarco told The Jersey Journal. \nWhile Bayonne has a proposed plan, numerous details would still have to be worked out. \n\"They're OK with the concept. Now it's about how does that actually work out,\" DeMarco said. \"What I anticipate is that (the Port Authority) will have certain standards that they will want met, and either it's something that is capable of being done, or it is not.\" \nBefore being approved, any ferry plan would have to be scritinized by a number of departments at the Port Authority, including its legal and commerce departments, DeMarco said. \nCity officials say a commuter ferry would be beneficial to the city in a number of ways: it would alleviate traffic, provide real estate value for property in the city, and provide an additional evacuation route. \n\"The ferry has a lot of obvious value, and then a lot of hidden value,\" DeMarco said. \"Should you have to evacuate the city, right now you're limited to the light rail, the Turnpike and the Bayonne Bridge. We don't really have water access.\" \nCorey McDonald may be reached at cmcdonald@jjournal.com.
