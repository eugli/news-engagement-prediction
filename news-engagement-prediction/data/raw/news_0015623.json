So maybe I have to change my ways a little. I may have to start tolerating people.” Long identified as a Los Angeles artist, tangentially connected to the West Coast branch of Pop-inflected photorealism represented by painters like Ed Ruscha and Robert Bechtle , Ms. Celmins began by restlessly rejecting abstraction and making deadpan, slightly eerie paintings of the things right in front of her in her studio: space heater , lamp, hot plate, television.

It was the late ’60s, but these weren’t chosen just for political effect: They were reminders of a tumultuous World War II childhood in Latvia, which her family fled as the Soviet Army advanced, ending up in Germany before immigrating to the United States as refugees. (“Where would we be now?” she said, mentioning President Trump’s temporary refugee ban.) She grew up in Indianapolis, not particularly happily. “I had many of the things that immigrants have — the fear, the feeling of always being an outsider,” she said, adding dryly, “And Indiana, if I may say so, is one of the worst states.” A scholarship took her west for graduate school, but she had had reservations about the East Coast, anyway. “Who knows what kind of artist I might have been if I had started out in New York?” she said. “I might have drunk myself to death at the Cedar Bar.” Though the heart of her work — graphite and charcoal drawings, mezzotint and woodcut prints, paintings — is often described as dark, it has always been backlighted, in a sense, by California sun. (Her ocean works are based on a handful of photographs, now yellowed, taken off a Venice pier in Los Angeles in the 1960s.) In person, Ms. Celmins (her full name is pronounced VEE-ya SELL-mins) is incredibly funny in an unexpected, borscht belt way, and friends say she is looser and less shy than she once was. But she has lost little of the monk-like, eyesight-punishing devotion to a certain kind of perfection, a devotion that drives expectant collectors crazy and has left room for little else in her life. She was married for a few years, to a writer, but has long lived alone, surrounded by a close circle of artist pals.

I’m so competitive.” Gary Garrels, the senior curator of painting and sculpture at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, said that during his more than 30 years as a curator, at several museums, he has tried at every opportunity to increase public holdings of Ms. Celmins’s work.“It was tough, because dealers would tell you, ‘There’s just nothing available!’ And that was before her prices increased. Now you really have to get yourself into a position to acquire if the opportunity comes.” (Last year a Celmins ocean drawing, from 1969, sold for $2.9 million at auction, believed to be a record for a drawing by a woman.) \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Garrels, who describes Ms. Celmins’s work as “distilled intensity,” added that her importance had always been confirmed in his mind by the zealous love of other artists for what she did. “I’ve worked with Richard Serra, and he doesn’t have much art in his loft, but there is a Vija Celmins,” he said. Robert Gober, another longtime admirer, told me: “The quiet dignity of her work is important, especially these days, and it’s also commensurate with my inability to explain its effect.” Ms. Celmins has never been much good at explaining the effect, either, which is one reason she rarely agrees to interviews . “I guess my work sometimes confuses people, because I really have nothing to say about the ocean, or the sky, or the moon. It’s more about the feeling of the magic of making things I could never have mine: my airplane, my ocean, my sky.” But she added (“because it’s not my nature to end things on a positive note”): “It boggles my mind, in the age of the web and everything so fast and fleeting, that someone wants to buy my work and show it, and people still want to look at it. In fact, people even seem to really like it now. Which, of course, makes me suspicious.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:10:50.598+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
