Katy Perry performs at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles, California. \nWith a refrain of “We think we’re free,” the song’s lyrics talk about being lulled into a “comfortable bubble.” Performing on a set that included a picture-perfect white picket fence, Perry was joined by Skip Marley, grandson of Jamaican reggae legend Bob Marley, whose songs often protested against oppression and social injustice. \nThe aftermath of November’s bitterly fought US presidential election has produced a succession of political comments by artists at awards shows, most notably actor Meryl Streep’s speech attacking US President Donald Trump during the Golden Globes Awards in January . \nThat spree continued on Sunday, as various artists talked about the divisive political atmosphere and the need to speak out. \n“At this particular time in history, our voices are needed more than ever,” said Jennifer Lopez onstage at the start of the show. \nIn a more comic vein, Grammys host James Corden began the show with a rap: “Live it all up because this is the best, and with President Trump we don’t know what comes next.” Host James Corden onstage during The 59th GRAMMY Awards at STAPLES Centre.

At the end of the song, women wearing headscarves joined the performers onstage accompanied by cries of “Resist!” Ali Shaheed Muhammad, left, and Jarobi White, from A Tribe Called Quest, perform at the 59th annual Grammy Awards.

In a bold statement that instantly made headlines, singer Joy Villa on the red carpet revealed a gown with “Make America Great Again” - the election slogan of Trump - stitched down the front. \nFollow @htshowbiz for more ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T18:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:34:49.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
