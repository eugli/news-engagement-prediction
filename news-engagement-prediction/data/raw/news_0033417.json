It was placed in the care of the National Park Service with $2.5 million in private funding. \nAny surplus produce not eaten by White House staff is donated to local non-profits. \n“The first lady has a deep personal commitment to her role as caretaker and nurturer, beginning with her family,” Wolkoff continues in her statement. “She believes there is a connection between a child’s mind and places of calm and beauty to be used as a tool for us all.” \nREAD MORE: Ivanka Trump a power player in Washington social, political worlds \nTrump’s team also announced earlier this month that she had hired interior decorator Tham Kannalikham to redecorate the family’s private living quarters in the White House, CNN says. \n“Mrs. Trump has a deep appreciation for the historical aspects of the White House and with Tham’s traditional design and expertise, they are focusing on a seamless integration of elegance and comfort into where the president, the first lady, and [their son] Barron will be spending their family time and calling their home,” Wolkoff told WWD in a statement. \nTrump also hired Lindsay Reynolds as her chief of staff.
