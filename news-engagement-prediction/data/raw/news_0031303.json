US agents are now trying to determine whether the Trump campaign cooperated with Moscow to disrupt Democrat Hillary Clinton’s campaign, The Times reported. \nThe newspaper, citing current and former US officials, said that no such evidence has yet emerged. \nFormer Trump advisor Paul Manafort, who was among those campaign officials heard on the calls, told The Times that the claims were “absurd.” \nTrump himself took fresh aim at the media in a tweet Wednesday, without mentioning the Times. \n“The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. @MSNBC & @CNN are unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great!” \nIn Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the latest allegations. \n“Don’t believe newspaper reports, it’s very difficult at the moment to differentiate them from falsehoods and fabrications,” Peskov told reporters. \n“If you don’t mind let’s wait and let’s not believe anonymous information, which is information based on no fact,” he said. \n– Trump warned about Flynn – \nThe White House admitted Tuesday that Trump was told three weeks ago that ousted national security advisor Michael Flynn may have misled colleagues about his Kremlin contacts. \nThe retired three-star general and former head of US defense intelligence initially denied discussing sanctions strategy with Russia’s ambassador Sergey Kislyak before taking office, a move that may have breached US law on negotiating with foreign powers. \nFlynn was asked to resign on Monday, after what the White House said was an internal investigation that showed no wrongdoing but “eroded” trust. \nFlynn is the third Trump aide to step back amid questions about his ties to Russia since the mogul began his improbable White House bid. \nHis departure follows those of Manafort and Carter Page, an early foreign policy advisor to the candidate. \nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer strongly denied that Trump had instructed Flynn to discuss possibly rolling back sanctions that Obama imposed on Russia. \n– Misleading Pence? – \nThe White House had painted Trump’s final decision as based on Flynn misleading Vice President Mike Pence. \nBut it emerged Tuesday that Trump kept Pence in the dark for two weeks. \nSpokesman Marc Lotter said Pence only learned the issue in media reports. \nThe unprecedented early resignation of a key staff member has rocked an administration already buffeted by leaks, infighting and legal defeats. \nWhen first informed, on January 26, that Flynn may have made misleading statements about his talks with Russia’s envoy, Spicer said the president “instinctively thought that General Flynn did not do anything wrong.” \nThe White House legal counsel “determined that there is not an illegal issue, but rather a trust issue,” Spicer said. \n“The evolving and eroding level of trust as a result … is what led the president to ask for General Flynn’s resignation.” \nThe White House also insisted that Trump — despite repeatedly professing admiration for Vladimir Putin and suggesting sanctions could be lifted —“has been incredibly tough on Russia.” \nIn a new hardening of the US line on Russia, Spicer added that “President Trump has made it very clear he expects the Russian government to de-escalate violence in the Ukraine and return Crimea.” \nThe State Department expressed concern that Russia is in breach of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, after reports that Moscow had deployed an operational ground-launched cruise missile unit. \nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov plans to meet his US counterpart Rex Tillerson on Thursday in Germany, when both diplomats will be in Bonn for the G20 ministerial talks, a foreign ministry spokeswoman said Wednesday. \nLavrov will “discuss bilateral relations, which were taken into a dead end by the previous administration,” the spokeswoman said. \nAlso on the agenda: “the main international crises which our countries have cooperated on and must cooperate,” as well as “regional issues,” she said. \n– Inquiries and missteps – \nThe White House’s efforts are likely to do little to assuage concerns on Capitol Hill about Russia’s influence in US politics. \nRepublicans and Democratic lawmakers have now called for an investigation into what occurred, although they differ sharply on the scope and powers. \nDemocratic Senator Elizabeth Warren insisted that Trump “owes Americans a full account” of his campaign and administration’s dealings with Moscow. \nThe Senate’s top Republican Mitch McConnell said it was “highly likely” that Flynn would have to testify before an intelligence panel. \nThe Times also reported that the FBI had interviewed Flynn on his calls with the Russian diplomat days into his job. \nThe CIA, FBI and other intelligence agencies have already investigated Moscow’s influence over the 2016 vote, concluding the Kremlin tried to sway it in Trump’s favor. \nVarious committees in the Republican-controlled Congress are looking into Russia’s election-related hacking and the Trump campaign’s links to Moscow.
