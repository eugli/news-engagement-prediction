In other words, the key purpose of GRC is to have a minority MP. \nIf Halimah Yacob quits as MP to become president of Singapore, Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC will be short their minority MP and that would be against the law and against Singapore Constitution. A by-election for the GRC must be held to have another minority MP elected into parliament. \nIt's also against the spirit of the GRC law for PAP to take away the minority MP from the Marsiling-Yew Tee residents. This disenfranchises minority voters and goes against the spirit of the GRC system. \nI find it extremely unfair that Marsiling residents may be deprived of a MP for 3 years after Halimah goes to become president to further her ambitions. \nBraun A.S.S Contributor Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
