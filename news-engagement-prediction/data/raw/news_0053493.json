The 26-year-old can pull off just about anything when it comes to red carpet fashion, from ladylike gowns to edgy dress-over-pants ensembles. Timed to the release of her highly-anticipated film, Beauty and the Beast , the actress has been demonstrating her love for fashion—more specifically, eco-concious duds —with a new Instagram account, aptly called \" The Press Tour .\" Created in partnership with the star's stylist, Rebecca Corbin-Murray, the account—which currently boasts 284,000 followers—chronicles Watson's looks as she attends a throng of promotional events and parties around the world. Each posts give a behind-the-scenes look into how the eco-conscious outfits were put together, along with a note of validity from Eco-Age, a brand agency that helps designers achieve growth through sustainability. Though there are only a handful of posts so far, Watson's press junket wardrobe includes stellar outfits by Oscar de la Renta, Stella McCartney, and Louis Vuitton.

According to Watson's Instagram post, the asymmetrical dress was created with fabrics made from recycled plastic bottles. \"These are sourced, mechanically processed and spun into yarns in Italy, with a fully traceable supply chain,\" the actress writes in the caption. \"This saves energy and reduces CO2 emissions compared to creating brand new polyester fibre. The arm band was created in a carbon-neutral mill.\" The gathered, tea-length skirt evokes the charm of the mid-18th century pinafore the actress wears in the film , while the leather ankle boots subtly suggests a modern take on men's footwear from the same era. Loading View on Instagram The actress has long been an advocate for sustainable fashion. In 2015, she joined the Green Carpet Challenge, an organization that champions ethical efforts of fashion designers, by taking the initiative to wear brands that were “considering local craft and production, artisan skills, the environment, sustainability, and the longevity of fashion.” Last year at the Met Gala, the actress made headlines when she wore a Calvin Klein outfit made out of recycled plastic bottles. Considering the fact that we have three more weeks to go until the film's release, the actress has plenty of time to showcase her eco-conscious sartorial choices. We sure hope this will further the fashion industry's efforts to promote sustainable fashion in the future.
