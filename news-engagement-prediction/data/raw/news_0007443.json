USA TODAY Sports Julio Jones was among the stars in Alabama's 2008 recruiting class. (Photo: Nelson Chenault, USA TODAY Sports) \nAcross college football, coaches are capping the frenzied and chaotic home stretch to this year’s recruiting cycle by tying up loose ends, securing last-minute verbal commitments and preparing the necessary paperwork for national signing day. \nFor nearly every program in the Football Bowl Subdivision, a proper grade for these recruiting classes can’t be provided for at least another three or four seasons — enough time for incoming recruits to develop and make an on-field impact. \nThere are outliers. The elite of college football sign prospects capable of making an immediate push for playing time; Alabama and Clemson, for example, will land first-day help from a number of freshmen and junior-college transfers. \nBut for the majority, it’s too early to tell. What we can do, however, is look back on the recent past to identify the top signing classes to come through the FBS. \nIn this week’s top-10 list, let’s look at the best recruiting classes since 2007. While grading recruits can be subjective, this list takes into account college success and number of future NFL draftees. Here’s the top 10, beginning with the class that started a dynasty: 1. 2008 Alabama \nNotable signees: WR Julio Jones, DL Marcell Dareus, RB Mark Ingram, DT Terrence Cody and OL Barrett Jones \nThe signing class that kicked off one of the great runs in FBS history. That above list only gives a slight taste of how many difference-making recruits Nick Saban signed in his first full cycle as Alabama’s head coach. New twist on old recruiting trend: Numbers of early enrollees on rise 2. 2013 Ohio State \nNotable signees: LB Darron Lee, DE Joey Bosa, QB J.T. Barrett, RB Ezekiel Elliott and DB Eli Apple \nA small slice of this class remains on campus, including Barrett, a fifth-year senior in 2017. But the majority has come and gone, with many already excelling in the NFL: Elliott’s already a star, Bosa was unstoppable in duty for the San Diego Chargers and Apple was fantastic as a rookie for the New York Giants, to name three. 2017 Composite Football Recruiting Rankings by Position 3. 2009 Alabama \nNotable signees: DB Dre Fitzpatrick, RB Eddie Lacy, RB Trent Richardson, QB AJ McCarron and OT D.J. Fluker \nComing on the heels of the 2008 class, this group solidified the Crimson Tide’s rise under Saban and provided the backbone of a roster that would capture back-to-back titles in 2011 and 2012. \nAmong the gems in Florida State's 2012 class was eventual Heisman winner Jameis Winston. (Photo: Kirby Lee, USA TODAY Sports) 4. 2012 Florida State \nNotable signees: QB Jameis Winston, DB Ronald Darby, DL Mario Edwards, DT Eddie Goldman and K Roberto Aguayo \nThough small in number — Florida State signed just 19 players — this class was long on talent. Winston won a Heisman Trophy, Edwards and Goldman were all-conference contributors and future NFL draftees, Darby was a shutdown cornerback and Aguayo one of the most effective kickers in NCAA history. 5. 2009 LSU \nNotable signees: LB Barkevious Mingo, CB Morris Claiborne, LB Kevin Minter, WR Rueben Randle and DT Michael Brockers \nBy 2011, this class provided the muscle behind one of the most impressive regular seasons in FBS history — even if the year ended with a disappointing loss in the rematch against Alabama. Mingo, Claiborne, Minter, Randle, Brockers, defensive end Sam Montgomery and defensive tackle Bennie Logan ended up being selected in the first three rounds of the NFL draft. What does a letter of intent say? 10 things to know 6. 2008 Oregon \nNotable signees: RB LaMichael James, RB LeGarrette Blount, DE Dion Jordan, QB Darron Thomas and LB Kiko Alonso \nOregon’s stranglehold on the Pac-12 during Chip Kelly’s tenure was built on this class. James is the most productive rusher in program history. Thomas was a multiple-year starter, if overshadowed by Marcus Mariota’s ensuing run under center. Jordan, originally signed as a tight end, developed into a first-round pick at defensive end. \nFlorida's 2007 class, led by Marquise Pouncey, would help Urban Meyer win his second national title. (Photo: Kim Klement, USA TODAY Sports) 7. 2007 Florida \nNotable signees: OL Michael and Maurkice Pouncey, DB Joe Haden, DE Carlos Dunlap, DB Major Wright and TE Aaron Hernandez \nThis group would help Urban Meyer win his second national title at Florida, though the final tally — including disappointing 2010 and 2011 seasons — is a bit of a mixed bag. But there’s no overlooking the future NFL talent the coaching staff reeled on board. The Gators’ class also gets bonus points for including five-star quarterback Cam Newton, even if he’d be dismissed from the program before making an impact. 8. 2011 Florida State \nNotable signees: DT Timmy Jernigan, TE Nick O’Leary, WR Kelvin Benjamin, WR Rashad Greene and RB Devonta Freeman \nOne year before Winston and others arrived on campus, this 2011 signing class helped Jimbo Fisher and the Seminoles lay the foundation for the 2013 national championship. 9. 2009 Stanford \nNotable signees: LB Shayne Skov, TE Zach Ertz, RB Stepfan Taylor, LB Trent Murphy and RB Tyler Gaffney \nUnlike most classes on this list, Stanford’s group in 2009 wasn’t loaded with top-100 talent — many were four-star recruits, to be fair, but the majority went largely overlooked in the final rankings. Time told the story: Ertz and Murphy were three-star signees who developed into All-America contributors, and Taylor and Gaffney headlined the Cardinal’s powerful running game. 10. 2009 Notre Dame \nNotable signees: LB Manti Te’o, OL Zack Martin, TE Tyler Eifert and RB Theo Riddick. \nWhile Te’o was the star of this class, the Irish signed another two eventual first-round picks in Martin and Eifert. Four years after joining the program, this class would lead Notre Dame to a 12-0 regular season and a spot in the national championship game against Alabama. \nPROJECTING THE 2017 PRESEASON TOP 25 Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. 1. Florida State: The Seminoles stumbled out of the gate this past season before hitting another gear following a loss to Clemson in October. With valuable experience under their belt and as much talent as any team in the country, Florida State is the team to beat in the Atlantic Coast Conference and very deserving of the title of preseason No. 1 in August. Steve Mitchell, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 2. Alabama: Personnel hits are coming, but that’s never derailed Alabama in the past. Quarterback Jalen Hurts will be even better, the offense should be more focused on the running game with a new coordinator and the defense will again rank among the nation’s best. Take note: Alabama and FSU meet in the opener. Brett Davis, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 3. Ohio State: Like the Crimson Tide, the Buckeyes will need to reload after losing several underclassmen to the NFL draft. But there will be far fewer losses this offseason than a year ago, so look for Ohio State to be loaded with talent and experience, not to mention more streamlined and less predictable on offense after some staffing changes. Rich Barnes, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 4. Michigan: The Wolverines will be right on the Buckeyes’ heels, as they were in 2016 — and as will be the case for as long as Jim Harbaugh and Urban Meyer are in charge. There is too much to like about Michigan to list here, but begin with the major assets: a wonderful defense despite a few losses in the back seven, a physical and punishing brand of offense, and a sense of unfinished business after two painful losses to end this year. Brad Mills, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 5. Washington: Reaching the Peach Bowl showed Washington’s growth, though the loss to Alabama revealed the distance still to travel before the Huskies can win a national championship. Considering Chris Petersen’s history, the 2017 team could be better than this year’s version, even if there will be a number of personnel issues to address as a result of early departures. The Huskies will be the preseason favorites in the Pac-12 and a strong contender for the Playoff. Jennifer Buchanan, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 6. Oklahoma: The Sooners obviously must improve on defense after a sluggish season, but there’s reason for optimism. Given the likely production of the Baker Mayfield-led offense, OU is simply a defense away from taking the Big 12 and returning to the Playoff. The Sooners have enormous expectations but slightly more question marks than the five teams listed above. Chuck Cook, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 7. USC: Let the hype begin for USC and its superb quarterback Sam Darnold, who will begin his sophomore season at or near the top of every Heisman Trophy list. The question: Are the Trojans ready to take the next step? The ability and athleticism are there, but the potential departure of several NFL-ready underclassmen bears watching. Gary A. Vasquez, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 8. Penn State: The Nittany Lions’ biggest post-regular season development was offensive coordinator Joe Moorhead’s decision to return in 2017. That, along with the return of quarterback Trace McSorley and running back Saquon Barkley, will ensure this offseason will be even better next season. Recapturing this year’s magic won’t be easy, but there’s zero reason to think Penn State is poised to take any step back. Marc Lebryk, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 9. Clemson: Clemson is among the most intriguing teams in college football entering next season. Deshaun Watson won’t be around, and that alone is reason to think the Tigers will begin the year pegged to finish behind Florida State. But this program recruits an elite level, has an outstanding defensive line, should get improved play on the offensive line and has earned the benefit of the doubt. Still, there will be major weapons to replace on offense and key leaders to replace on defense. This may nonetheless be too low a ranking for Clemson. Joshua S. Kelly, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 10. Oklahoma State: To call Oklahoma State a sleeper ignores the fact that this program has been in the national picture for the better part of the decade. But there seems to be something overlooked about the Cowboys, who return the heart of their offense and have enough coming back on defense to be right alongside or just behind Oklahoma on the Big 12 ladder. Kevin Jairaj, USA TODAY Sports 11. LSU: The Tigers’ impressive bowl win against Louisville provided some early validation for Ed Orgeron. How far LSU goes hinges almost entirely on how quickly new coordinator Matt Canada can turn around the offense. Jonathan Dyer, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 12. Wisconsin: Any doubts of Wisconsin’s ability to remain a national presence should be dismissed after another banner year for Paul Chryst and the Badgers. UW will be just behind the top three of Ohio State, Michigan and Penn State in the Big Ten. Thomas J. Russo, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 13. Virginia Tech: In what was supposed to be a building year, Justin Fuente led the Hokies to a divisional title and 10 wins. The future will be even better, beginning with a 2017 team that should repeat atop the ACC Coastal Division. Jim Dedmon, Jim Dedmon-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 14. Auburn: This is the most intriguing team in the SEC and perhaps in all of college football. Auburn is often hit or miss, but the addition of Baylor transfer Jarrett Stidham should kick the Tigers’ offense into a different gear. But will that be enough? Chuck Cook, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 15. Stanford: Replacing Christian McCaffrey and finding better quarterback play are the Cardinal’s most pressing questions entering the offseason. This might not be a perfect team, but trust in David Shaw and his staff to pilot Stanford to another season spent in the thick of the Pac-12 and Rose Bowl hunt. Ivan Pierre Aguirre, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 16. Boise State: The top-ranked team from the Group of Five ranks will again be a favorite for double-digit wins during the regular season. Look for quarterback Brett Rypien to take another step forward and become a top-10 player at his position nationally. Matt Kartozian, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 17. Georgia: The SEC East Division will be a toss-up, with Georgia and two other teams soon to appear on this battling for a shot at the conference title. The Bulldogs seem the most likely to take another step forward thanks to quarterback Jacob Eason’s development and the arrival of an outstanding recruiting class. Justin Ford, USA TODAY Sports 18. Tennessee: But the Volunteers aren’t far behind. Much depends on finding a capable successor to quarterback Josh Dobbs and locating the sort of consistency needed to go from top-25 team to Playoff contender. Christopher Hanewinckel, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 19. Louisville: There’s always reining Heisman winner Lamar Jackson, but Louisville’s late swoon raises the issue of whether this team is about more than just a sublime quarterback and offense. While still very much a threat in the ACC, the Cardinals should be placed behind FSU and Clemson in the Atlantic Division. Kim Klement, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 20. South Florida: Adding a defense-first coach in Charlie Strong to an impressive offense will keep USF in the mix for 10-plus wins and a New Year’s Six bowl in 2017. There are several strong contenders in the American Athletic Conference, but the Bulls are the preseason favorite. Shanna Lockwood, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 21. Utah: Pegging the Utes for a national ranking seems like a safe bet. Whether Utah can do more – such as knock off USC and win the South Division – remains a question, however, particularly with losses at running back, wide receiver and the defensive line. Kelley L Cox, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 22. Florida: It all comes down to the offense, and whether the Gators’ attack can finally find some momentum under Jim McElwain and produce at the rate needed to compete for a Playoff berth. That’s still a concern entering McElwain’s third season in charge. Kim Klement, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 23. West Virginia: There will be a new quarterback and a different look on defense, especially in the secondary. The Mountaineers are still a threat for a top-three finish in the Big 12 after what may very well be a breakthrough season for Dana Holgorsen. Logan Bowles, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 24. Texas: Does Texas have the same potential as Tom Herman’s first team at Houston, which went 13-1 and won the Peach Bowl? Maybe, but probably not. This team won’t win the Big 12, but a change in culture and a huge uptick in production on offense should find the Longhorns at eight or nine wins in 2017. Brendan Maloney, USA TODAY Sports 25. UCLA: It almost never pays to have faith in Jim Mora and UCLA, but years of strong recruiting and a healthy Josh Rosen under center should yield a nice rebound after a horrific 2016 season. Mark J.
