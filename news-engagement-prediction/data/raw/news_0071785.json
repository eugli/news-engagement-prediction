( Bruce Sorrell via Flickr ) \nThe mercury shot up to 76 degrees at Dulles International Airport at 2 p.m. Thursday, shattering the record high for the date of 73 set in 1985. \nCapital Weather Gang’s Ian Livingston points out it is the second warmest temperature ever observed in February at Dulles (records go back to 1963). \nTemperatures this warm aren’t normal in the region until mid-May. \nNeighboring weather stations were also abnormally warm, but not quite at record levels. Reagan National Airport had risen to 73 degrees while Baltimore-Washington International Marshall Airport had hit 76. The record at those two airports is 78 from 1874. \nWith temperatures still rising, Dulles has an outside chance of matching its highest February temperature ever observed of 79 degrees (in 1985 and 2000). \nThe Washington-Baltimore region joins many others in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast where temperatures were at or not far off records. Locations at or approaching records at 2 p.m. eastern Thursday.
