Picture taken on December 31, 2016. (Reuters) \nJust over a month after Mariah Carey’s New Year’s Eve performance fiasco, the singer is clearly shaking off the negativity with a workout at the gym. \nBut in true diva fashion the superstar wore unconventional fitness attire. \nThe mother of twins wore a black leotard, fishnets, perhaps channeling a modernized version of Olivia Newton-John’s throwback classic, “Let’s Get Physical” video. She also wore a varsity jacket with a pair of stiletto heeled boots. \nShe posted a series of video at Gunnar Peterson's gym Thursday.
