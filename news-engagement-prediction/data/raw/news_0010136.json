He plans to start a business to design and produce fashionable clothes for his dolls, each of which costs at least 10,000 yuan (£1,170). When asked why he likes his dolls, Li said: 'Many people in China call me and other fans of dolls \"perverts\". I do not wish to justify myself. 'These dolls are beautiful. They are the combinations of the best features taken from various women. I'm simply appreciating their beauty.' Although these dolls are sold as sex toys, the man insisted that he does not consider them pleasure devices; instead he treats them as family members. However, he encourages his only son, who is 18 years old, to use dolls 'to satisfy his biological needs'. The man has spent more than 100,000 yuan (£11,600) buying costumes for his companions Li cleans and grooms his dolls regularly and takes them on holidays whenever he can On his son's 18th birthday last month, Li bought him a silicone figure as a gift so 'he could put her to good use when he needs'. The father explained: 'I want him to use the doll instead of catching random diseases from outside by accident. 'When I gave him sex education, I taught him the importance of staying safe when it comes to sex.' Li and his son currently live with seven dolls. Five of them belong to Li and the other two were given to him to look after by his friends, who are a couple and could no longer take care of the dolls after they got married. He is likely to have seven more dolls next year because 'a friend of mine is moving abroad and needs someone to provide care for her dolls'. Li's son Yang Yang received his first silicone doll when he turned 18 years old last month His father gave him a doll, named Xiao Ying, so he could 'put her to good use when he needs' The father and son held a party for their dolls at their home in Huishui, Guizhou Province Li used to work as a biochemical inspector for the local centre for disease control and prevention. After divorcing his wife in 2004, the man raised his son Yang Yang, who was five years old at the time, all by himself. Li's obsession with silicone dolls started in 2010 during a trip to Beijing. He was travelling with his girlfriend at the time and the couple went into a shop which sold Japanese silicone dolls. Li recalled: 'We were stunned by how beautiful the dolls were. Unfortunately, each of them cost more than 70,000 yuan (£8,185) and we couldn't afford one at the time.' The man added that his girlfriend, who was in her early 20s then, had been interested in the figures because she wanted to dress them up. Li's seven dolls have their own beds, own wardrobes and own lifestyle at his house When Li drives, he puts one doll on the passenger seat. His son sits with two others at the back The couple broke up in 2014, but Li continued his passion for the dolls. The same year, Li bought his first doll to deal with loneliness because his son was at school all the time. He called her Xiao Xue, or Little Snow. Li took great care of Little Snow. He cleaned her daily, brought her new dresses and took her on outings. In an interview with Pear Video , the man said: 'Sometimes when I drive, I'd put her on the passenger's seat. I would feel like I have got a companion.' His son would snuggle up to the dolls on the back seat. Li also enjoys making music videos for his dolls. He shares the clips on Chinese internet forums Li spends a lot of money taking glamour photos for Little Snow, too. He said to Pear Video: 'It's a shame that it didn't snow this winter. Otherwise, I could have bring Little Snow to take a set of beautiful snow-themed photos.' After Little Snow, Li carried on buying four more dolls to keep him company. His son, Yang Yang, who had just been given his first doll, Xiao Ying, as a birthday gift said because of the dolls, his home is no longer quiet. The teenager said that in a way these dolls had stepped in to replace the female roles in his family. Defending his hobby, Li told MailOnline: 'Sex doll collectors and users are very normal. As a matter of fact, [we] are more normal than those people who call us \"weird\" but who themselves have unfaithful sexual relationships.'
