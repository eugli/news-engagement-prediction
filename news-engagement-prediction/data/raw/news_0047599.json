Published:February 21, 2017 1:25 pm Popular film director Priyadarshan \nPopular filmmaker Priyadarshan is in a state of shock and slammed reports that the popular Malayalam female actor was raped in her car. The popular star was abducted on the way from Thrissur to Kochi on Friday and molested allegedly by a seven-member gang. According to reports, the abductors also took pictures and videos to blackmail her. The director said he has spoken to the actor who said she wasn’t raped but was harassed by her former driver and his accomplice. \n  \n“First of all, she was not raped. How can something so grave and evil be trivialised by wrong reportage? I spoke to her after the awful incident and she very clearly told me she was NOT raped. Yes, she was abducted apparently by her former driver and his friends, who has already been arrested thanks to the swift intervention and action of the cop-in-charge. They forced themselves into her car, stripped her and took pictures apparently with the intention of demeaning and blackmailing her,” the director said as quoted by Bollywood Hungama. \nThe director also said that he was shocked that such an incident happened in Kochi and that too to someone close to him. “It is shocking and unbelievable that this could happen in Kochi. Here it is a very tightly-knit community. Everyone knows everyone else. So, no one does anything that would bring shame to the person and community. I know her very well. She is bubbly, chirpy, friendly, warm and innocent and she’s very popular in the Malayalam film industry,” added the report quoting the director. \nAlso read | Mammootty, Manju Warrier, Dileep and others rally for justice.
