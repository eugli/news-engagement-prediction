In the film world alone, the genre can manifest as psychological, physiological, allegorical, or sometimes just plain gross. Finding a way into its myriad nooks and crannies, however, can be a daunting proposition. Film fans always benefit from cinematic mentors, after all, and Dr. Udru is here for anyone in need of guidance. \nThe YouTube channel’s numerous videos succinctly and eloquently break down the origins, influences, and ripple effects of several subgenres, including slashers and Korean revenge films. It also zeroes in on particular talents (Ed Wood, Peter Jackson), properties (Hannibal Lecter, Tales from the Crypt ), and industry curiosities (one video explores whether Steven Spielberg actually directed Tobe Hooper’s Poltergeist ). \nDr. Udru’s video on body horror is one solid example of the channel’s efficiency. In little more than six minutes, the host outlines the genre’s cultural underpinnings using specific examples from its innovators, including David Cronenberg and Ridley Scott. Watch that one below, but know that, like most body horror, it’s decidedly NSFW. \nThe channel uploads new videos every other Friday. \nSubmit your Great Job, Internet tips here .
