A person exposed to cyanide may have cherry-red skin from high oxygen levels or a dark or blue coloring, from Prussian blue (iron binding to the cyanide ion). Also, skin and body fluids may give off an odor of almonds. How Much Cyanide Is Lethal? \nHow much cyanide is too much depends on the route of exposure, the dose, and duration of exposure. Inhaled cyanide presents a greater risk than ingested cyanide. Skin contact is not as much of a concern (unless it has been mixed with DMSO), except touching the compound could lead to accidentally swallowing some of it. As a rough estimate, since lethal dose depends on the exact compound and several other factors, about half a gram of ingested cyanide will kill a 160-lb adult. \nUnconsciousness, followed by death, could occur within several seconds of inhaling a high dose of cyanide, but lower doses and ingested cyanide may allow a few hours to a couple of days for treatment. Emergency medical attention is critical. Is there a Treatment for Cyanide Poisoning? \nBecause it's a relatively common toxin in the environment, the body can detoxify a small amount of cyanide. For example, you can eat the seeds of an apple or withstand cyanide from cigarette smoke without dying. \nWhen cyanide is used as a poison or a chemical weapon, treatment depends on the dose. A high dose of inhaled cyanide is lethal too quickly for any treatment to take effect. Initial first aid for inhaled cyanide is getting the victim to fresh air. Ingested cyanide or lower doses of inhaled cyanide may be countered by administering antidotes that detoxify cyanide or bind to it. For example, natural vitamin B12 , hydroxocobalamin, reacts with cyanide to form cyanocobalamin, which is excreted in urine. \nInhalation of amyl nitrite may aid breathing in victims of cyanide and also carbon monoxide poisoning, although few first aid kits contain these ampules anymore. \nDepending on the conditions, complete recovery may be possible, although paralysis, liver damage, kidney damage, and hypothyroidism are possible.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:53:26.209+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
