Sweet Provisions is the fifth outlet from chef and restaurateur Christopher Collins — his third in that shopping center alone.\nCollins opened Grassroots Kitchen & Tap in 2011 and Twisted Grove Parlor + Bar in 2015. His restaurants — including another Grassroots Kitchen at Town & Country in Phoenix and Wally’s American Gastropub in Scottsdale — are popular neighborhood hangouts specializing in gussied-up American comfort fare.\nSweet Provisions Where: 8120 N. Hayden Road, Scottsdale.\nDetails: 480-275-2676, sweetprovisionsaz.com .\nHours: 11 a.m.-10 p.m. Sundays-Thursdays, 11 a.m.-11 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays.\n“We listened to our neighbors and they’re telling us they want a sweet shop,” Collins said.\nSweet Provisions will serve ice cream made from scratch — milk, cream, eggs, sugar — in small ($3), medium ($4) and large ($5) scoops. Look for eight to 10 flavors at a time, including Georgia peach pie, triple-shot coffee and pistachio with candied bacon. The 900-square-foot space also will feature floats and ice cream sandwiches, made with house-made cookies.\nRELATED: Girl Scout cookie desserts at 21 Phoenix-area restaurants through Feb. 28 | Cooking Channel's 'Unique Sweets' visits top sweet shops around Phoenix | Creamistry now at Uptown Plaza in Phoenix | 11 places for healthy, light desserts around Phoenix \n“I’m most excited about our oatmeal pecan cookie recipe,” Collins said. “It is so good. We nailed it.”\nOther sweet offerings will include several flavors of brownies ($5) — toffee, peanut butter, blonde, chocolate raspberry — and pies (whole or by the slice), including banana cream and strawberry rhubarb. If you feel like you’re a kid in a candy store, you just might be. Sweet Provisions will sell 30 types of mix-and-match candies.\nDetails: Opening at 8120 N.
