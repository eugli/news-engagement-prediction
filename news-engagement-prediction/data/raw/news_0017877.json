By Elizabeth Bloom / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nThe Robert Morris men’s hockey team will face Niagara on Feb. 26 at Heinz Field in what will be the first collegiate hockey game ever played at the Steelers stadium. \nThe outdoor game, which is also the Colonials’ regular season finale, will take place the day after the Penguins face the Flyers as part of the NHL’s Stadium Series. \nAdmission will be free for the 7:05 p.m. game, the last of the Atlantic Hockey regular season. \nNiagara and Robert Morris originally were scheduled to play on Feb. 24 at Niagara. Instead, the teams will have a two-game set, facing off at Niagara’s Dwyer Arena on Feb. 25 before traveling to Pittsburgh for the outdoor game. The Colonials (16-9-3, 12-8-2) are third in the Atlantic Hockey standings. \n“Our players and staff are thrilled to be playing at Heinz Field,” Colonials head coach Derek Schooley said in a statement. “This is another event that Robert Morris men’s hockey is proud to be associated with and have a tremendous amount of gratitude to the Penguins, Steelers, NHL and Niagara University for making this a reality.” \nOutside of these upcoming matchups, there has been only one other hockey game played at Heinz Field — the 2011 Winter Classic between the Penguins and Washington Capitals. Robert Morris has played outdoors once before, in January 2015. That game took place in Toledo, Ohio. The Colonials and Bowling Green tied, 2-2. \n“The Pittsburgh Penguins are big supporters of college hockey and we’re excited to have Robert Morris and Niagara playing outdoors at Heinz Field on February 26,” David Morehouse, CEO and president of the Penguins, said in a statement. “We appreciate that both athletic departments altered their schedules to accommodate this unique opportunity. Our slogan is ‘It’s a Great Day for Hockey,’ but it’s clear that this will be a Great Weekend for Hockey in Pittsburgh.” \nElizabeth Bloom: , 412-263-1750 and Twitter: @BloomPG .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T07:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T02:22:32.677+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
