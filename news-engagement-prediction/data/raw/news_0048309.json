He wears track pants, denim jackets, swerv-y sunglasses, that kind of thing (close relationships with Dior Homme's Kris Van Assche, Jeremy Scott, and Raf Simons don't hurt either). Yesterday in Milan, for example, he wore blue jeans, sneakers, and a long-sleeve striped T-shirt. This classic shirt —created for the French Navy in 1858—is a spring-season staple for stylish men, particularly those that lean more Pablo Picasso than Tom Brady. \nBurberry's Christopher Bailey showed his see-now-buy-now Spring 2017 collection in London yesterday and also used this classic crewneck throughout the show. The collection was inspired by British sculptor Henry Moore. Where there is an arty reference, there is the Breton-stripe shirt. \nThe thing we dig about this shirt is that it looks equally great under a suit to work, or with sweats when you're grabbing a coffee in the morning. Layered up with a T-shirt like Rocky, it takes on a skater vibe. And, unless you're trying to buy off-the-runway Burberry, you can easily pick one up for under $100. Whether you're a jock or an artist, you should get your hands on one now, even if it's still technically winter. Season-pushing is allowed when it comes to something this perfect.
