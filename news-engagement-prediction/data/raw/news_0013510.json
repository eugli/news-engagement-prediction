Number 4 was 'Do well in Ranji' and against it was the remark 'Preparation in progress'. Fast forward five months, and Rahul can very well put a huge tick mark against that final entry. In his debut first-class season, the 21-year-old middle-order batsman racked up 945 runs at an average of 72.69 including seven fifties and two hundreds for Services. Only Jiwanjot Singh of Punjab (995 in 2012-13) has scored more runs in a debut Ranji season. The stellar performance failed to earn him a spot in the Rest of India team for the Irani Cup, but what came his way was a place in the India A squad that will play a three-day warm-up game against Australia from February 16-18. Talking about the season, Rahul, who shifted base from Hyderabad to Services in search of more playing time, says that he knew he could hold his own at this level and it was only a matter of getting the right opportunity. \"I did not have any doubt that I cannot play at this level,\" he tells TOI Sports. \"I have played age group cricket throughout and last year, when I was in under-23 standbys (for Hyderabad), my fellow mates in district level were playing Ranji. One such player was Mohammad Saif of UP who scored 198 in a Ranji match. During our Under-16 days I was the top scorer with him so I felt that at this level if he is scoring runs, I can too. I had the confidence that if I get the chance I will also be able to score runs, but I didn't expect to score over 900 runs in the season.\" Rahul did not have a rousing start to the season. He scored 11, 23 and 28 in his first three innings, but spurred on by his team-mate Shamsher Yadav 's performance, then hit a purple patch with five consecutive fifty-plus scores including two hundreds (182 versus J&K and 127* against Andhra). Scores of 49, 2 and 26 where sandwiched between four more fifty-plus scores, including 99 against Chhattisgarh. Shamsher, in his first season for Services, scored 639 runs with three hundreds and two fifties. \"I didn't think much in the first two matches. I was playing well but was not converting the starts. Then I started observing Shamsher. In the first match he scored a fifty and in the second he scored a hundred, and I was watching him from the non-striker's end. He played very patiently and waited for the loose balls to score and I just followed that.\" says Rahul. \"We played together a lot in the season and we gelled well. Our running between the wickets was good, there was no pressure playing with him and he was very helpful. And once I got my first fifty, I gained confidence and capitalised on it.\" A video posted by G Rahul Singh Â® (@grahulsingh99) on Jan 28, 2017 at 8:45am PST A naturally aggressive left-hander, Rahul admits that he did get carried away during the season and hopes to rectify that in the next season. \"After some good knocks I got carried away and started taking a lot more risks. I got out on 49, 52 and 99. I could have converted at least two fifties plus scores to hundreds and I could have made 1000 runs. But at the end of the season I learned a lot and cricket is always about learning, so that is what I am going to do in the next season.\" Move from Hyderabad to Services \"I used to perform well at the state level, but my last year at U-19 was disappointing,\" says Rahul. \"I was the captain that year, but had to step down. Next year I did well in the leagues but I was in U-23 standbys despite leading south zone and performing well in the PS Ram Mohan Roy Trophy hosted by the TNCA. I did not see any scope being there, because the next season I had to start from scratch. Another factor was that the U-23 season and Ranji Trophy start simultaneously so even if I performed well in U-23, I would still miss most of the Ranji season and then could have only hoped for a couple of chances before the season ended. I did not want to waste that much time so I moved to Services.\" Unlike shifting base to any other state team, moving to the Services Sports Control Board (SSCB) means that a player is recruited into the Indian Armed Forces and then goes on to represent the team under the sports quota. In short, it is not an easy process. But Rahul's move was facilitated by the fact that his father, Ram Ishwar Singh, is a CISF personnel and with the Indian Army headquarters in Hyderabad; thus the 21-year-old had got the attention of the SSCB officials. \"A SSCB official, Brijesh Nair, who is like an elder brother to me, felicitated the move. Biju sir and I used to practice together so he talked to the coach about me and he helped me with the opportunity. My reporting would also be in Hyderabad and ultimately it was to play cricket, so the option was good for me,\" explains Rahul. Father's dream As long as Rahul can remember, he wanted to become a cricketer. And the driving force behind it was his father, who is an avid cricket lover. \"My dad had a lot of interest in cricket. When I was 3-4 years old, he used to take me to the park and make me play,\" remembers Rahul. \"He used make me do fielding drills, and frankly I used to enjoy as well. You can say that it was his dream to see me became a cricketer. He has supported me a lot. He used to adjust his job schedule keeping in mind my training. And it was just not him. My mother also was very supportive.\" Services did not have a season to remember as they finished seventh in Group C with only one win to their name and in the Syed Mustaq Ali Trophy they notched up two wins in five games. But Rahul will be gearing up for his India A debut against Australia in two weeks, and sees the selection as a reward for the hard work he put in. Beyond this opportunity, he targets an international debut. \"The plan is to play for India at the international level. Karun Nair got an opportunity and he has cemented his place. He is not going anywhere for at least two years and I want do the same; grab the opportunity and the make it my own. Agle paanch saal mein international debut to kaarna hi hai [I want to make my India debut in the next five years].\" And back to Instagram, Rahul's most recent post is a screenshot of the India A squad with a caption 'Just the Beginning #INDIA A.'
