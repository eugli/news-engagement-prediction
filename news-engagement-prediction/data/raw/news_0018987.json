(Photo: USA TODAY Sports) 35 CONNECT 5 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nMichigan State has suspended three football players while the university conducts an investigation into allegations of a sexual assault complaint last month, the school announced in a news release today. \nMSU Police has been working with the Ingham County Prosecutor’s Office and will forward its reports for review and possible criminal charges. The three MSU players, who were not identified in the release, have been removed from on-campus housing pending the conclusion of the investigation. \nOne football staff member also has been suspended by the athletic department. \nMSU also is conducting a Title IX investigation of the sexual assault allegations. Title IX consultant Rebecca Veidlinger will report her findings to the Office of Institutional Equity, according to MSU spokesman Jason Cody. \nNo charges have been filed, although Ingham County Prosecutor Carol Siemon confirmed to the Lansing State Journal that her office has been in contact with university police about the investigation and expects to receive its report next week for review. \nMSU’s news release said detectives are interviewing members of the football coaching staff. \nSeparate from the criminal and Title IX investigations, the university administration also is using an external law firm to conduct an independent investigation into football program staff members’ compliance with university policy in relation to the allegations. \n“Sexual assault is unacceptable, and members of MSU Athletics who fail to uphold our standards for creating a culture that is safe, supportive, and responsive to those affected by it will be held accountable,” Michigan State athletic director Mark Hollis said in a released statement. “My expectation of all members of the department is full and complete cooperation with all investigations.” \nRelated:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T06:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:41:51.393+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
