Both enclaves have long been popular transit points for sub-Saharan African migrants trying to cross the sea at the narrow point south of Spain. At least 800 African migrants tried to storm a border fence into Ceuta from Morocco on New Year's Day, Reuters reported , citing the Spanish and Moroccan governments . Migrants sit on the ground next to Spanish police officers after crossing into Ceuta. Most of the migrants that day were prevented from entering Spanish territory. A handful of migrants scaled the 6-meter-high barbed-wire fence but were eventually removed by cranes, Reuters reported. Dozens of Moroccan security agents were injured in the incident, along with five Spanish police officers. A young woman was arrested in December 2016 after being caught trying to smuggle a 19-year-old African migrant into Ceuta in her suitcase . The man was treated for lack of sufficient oxygen inside the compact travel bag, Spain's Civil Guard said in a statement. This creative but dangerous method of concealment is one of several desperate approaches to illegal smuggling that the Spanish Civil Guard has faced on the Ceuta border. Woman busted smuggling teen refugee inside suitcase Two migrants -- a man and a woman -- from Guinea were also rescued in December after authorities discovered them hidden inside the dashboard and the backseat of a Volkswagen Golf, the Spanish Civil Guard said. A Moroccan man driving the car, which had been stolen, was arrested, officials said. CNN's Lauren Said-Moorehouse contributed to this story.
