So will a lifeline for one Native American tribe Arizona’s Kayenta Mine has exactly one customer, the coal-fired Navajo Generating Station. When that power plant closes, the ripple effects may leave no one on the impoverished Hopi Reservation untouched. Ryan Randazzo , The Republic | azcentral.com Share This Story Email Comment \nBLACK MESA — The massive dragline bucket at the Kayenta Mine claws deep into the brittle rock, lifts and swings to the side, moving enough shiny black coal to bury a small house. \nThe coal from Black Mesa, a mountainous area straddling Navajo and Hopi land in the northeast corner of Arizona, is loaded into an oversize dump truck, crushed and placed on a conveyor belt arcing over hilltops into silos 17 miles away. Then, an electric train hauls the load 80 miles across the scenic high desert outside Monument Valley to the largest coal burner in the West. \nThe Navajo Generating Station consumes 240 rail cars of Kayenta’s coal every day, making enough electricity to power more than a half million homes at once. \nSome of it lights up the Las Vegas Strip. Some goes to Phoenix and Tucson. Still more of the coal power runs pumps along the Central Arizona Project canal, pushing Colorado River water nearly 3,000 feet uphill across the state, enabling cheap water for agriculture, grass lawns and pools. CLOSE Share Mine employees and officials talk about the possible closure of the Kayenta Mine. Mark Henle/azcentral.com \nTogether, the mine and the power plant employ 750 workers, nearly all Native Americans living on the two reservations, where unemployment approaches 50 percent. The operations support communities from Tuba City, a small enclave 60 miles west of the mine, with a grocery store, banks and a few hotels, to the non-reservation city of Page on the shore of Lake Powell and the Navajo town of Kayenta, with about 5,000 people. \nBut because there are cheaper alternatives for making electricity, the power plant’s owners voted to close it in two years. \nIf the generating station closes, the mine loses its only customer. It, too, will close. \nBoth tribes will lose jobs and income from the plant and mine. But the Navajo Nation, with about 170,000 members on the reservation, draws revenue from multiple sources. The 15,000-member Hopi tribe has little else but the crops and livestock they cultivate in the surrounding canyons. Changing economics \nAfter spending years on expensive negotiations with the Environmental Protection Agency to keep the coal plant open, four of the five owners — Salt River Project, Arizona Public Service Co., Tucson Electric Power and NV Energy — decided in early February to give up the fight. \nThis time, the issue is not carbon emissions or haze at the Grand Canyon. It is economics. The utilities can get cheaper power from natural-gas-powered plants, saving each owner millions of dollars per year. \nThe fifth owner, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, uses its share to power the pumps on the canal and pay off debt from its construction. The agency wants to keep the facilities open but can't foot the bill for the entire plant. Navajo Generating Station \nNGS: 5 things to know \nCombined, the mine and coal plant generate billions in economic benefit that spreads statewide. When they close, the Navajo's $173 million budget will shrink by about $40 million from lost coal royalties and lease payments from the power plant. \nBut the Navajo also have coal operations in New Mexico, as well as casino gambling and access to major highways to tap into tourism. \nAbout half of the Hopi live on their reservation, which is surrounded by the Navajo Reservation, effectively cutting off the smaller tribe from most economic opportunities. \nHopi Chairman Herman Honanie has worked for tribal government since 1977. He said tribal members are split nearly evenly between support for the mine and closing it because of environmental concerns. \nHe sides with keeping the mine open. \n“The practicality is we have a growing population and we have growing needs,” Honanie said. “We have one foot in our culture and the other foot on the other side of dominant society and we are trying to mesh that together.” \nApproximately 350 people who work for the tribe rely on the royalties from the mine for a significant portion of their paychecks. Those workers provide services from tribal courts to hospice care for the elderly. Hopi Tribe Chairman Herman Honanie in his office on Feb. 3, 2017, in Kykotsmovi, Ariz.

Less than $2 million trickles in from court fees, business taxes, and investments in the KoKopeli Inn in Sedona, Three Canyon Ranch near Winslow and Moenkopi Legacy Inn near Tuba City. \nLike many people in coal country across the U.S., Honanie is hopeful President Donald Trump's government will step in and ease regulations to make coal more competitive. Toward that end, the U.S. Department of Interior has invited all stakeholders to Washington, D.C., on March 1 to discuss options for the plant. \n\"If we can manage to lobby effectively and bring this attention to their ear, to their minds, and hopefully in some effective unified front between us and the Navajo and whomever else, if we can get an audience with them, we hope that they can come to our aid in the best possible way,\" Honanie said.

Freezing temperatures are common from November through May and tens of thousands of homes on the two reservations lie beyond the reach of electricity, water and natural-gas service. \nMany also make use of the water depot at the mine, which allows them to fill cisterns in their trucks with water for homes and livestock. \nFor the free coal, some people drive hundreds of miles in the middle of the night to be first in line when the gates open at 6 a.m. at an area called the load out. \nOn a recent Saturday, about 100 people swung picks, sledgehammers and hatchets to break off chunks of coal to be stacked meticulously into cars and trucks.

(Photo: Mark Henle/The Republic) \nDarryl Sahema drove more than an hour from the Hopi village of Polacca. He rolled his pickup truck past frosted coal piles until he found one that hadn’t been picked over. Big, shiny pieces burn best in stoves, and they get scooped up fast. \n“It burns slow and hot,” Sahema said, wool cap pulled down low, catching his breath in the morning chill between armloads. “It’s a good, reliable source of heat.” \nSahema, 37, earns a living by helping with a relative’s livestock and by cutting and selling firewood. The father of three young boys, he also hauls coal for elderly relatives who can’t handle the labor. \nSome entrepreneurs purchase the coal, bag it, and sell it on street corners in reservation towns. Such activity flouts the spirit of the program, but the mine turns a blind eye. \nMaurice George, 41, loaded up before dawn with the best coal and sat in the cab of his white Dodge pickup with 9-year-old son Chesney, looking for a sale on a corner in Tuba City. The pair took two hours to load 3,250 pounds of coal into the truck, selling bags similar in size to sacks of concrete for $10. When it’s cold, they will sell 60 bags in a day. \n“That’s my income right there,” George said. “I supply my family with food and electricity and everything from selling.” Charlotte Begay, 64, of Shonto, Ariz., breaks up coal with a pickaxe at the public loadout facility at the Kayenta Mine on Feb. 4, 2017.
