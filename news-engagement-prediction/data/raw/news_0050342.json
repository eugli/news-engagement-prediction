The actress said it had been a ‘difficult time’ for the entire family \n‘Many many people find themselves in this situation. We’ve all been through a difficult time – my focus is my children, our children, and my focus is finding this way through,’ she said. \n‘We are and forever will be a family and so that is how I am coping, I’m coping with finding a way through to make sure that this somehow makes us stronger and closer.’ More ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T15:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T10:17:52.324+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
