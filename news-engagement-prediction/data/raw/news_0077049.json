Antonio Brown (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 5:47 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 5:47 p.m. ET \nAntonio Brown has ranked either first or second in the NFL in receptions over the last four years, and the Steelers rewarded their standout wide receiver Monday with a new contract that sets him to be a Steeler for life. \nThe new five-year contract will reportedly make Brown the NFL's highest-paid receiver. Antonio Brown deal: 4-year extension worth $68 million - 17M per year over 4 years, and $18.5M over 3 years. Tied to Steelers through 2021. — Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) February 27, 2017 \n\"AB is a big contributor to our success, has been for several years now, and I think he’s capable of continuing to be that kind of player,\" Steelers president Art Rooney II said. \"I think he’s someone who wants to be a great player and works hard to be that. Hopefully, he’ll continue to evolve as a player and as a person.\" \nGoing on 29, Brown was set to make $4.71 million in the final year of a six-year restructured contract, but now he'll easily make more than salary leaders A.J.
