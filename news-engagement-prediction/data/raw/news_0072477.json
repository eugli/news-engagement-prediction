Gigi and Bella Hadid Take the Twinning Trend to Milan Fashion Week February 22, 2017 7:53 PM by Maria Ward Photo: AKM-GSI If there were any doubt that fashion runs in the family, sisters Gigi and Bella are living proof. The supermodel siblings have a longstanding history of shopping one another’s closets, swapping everything from jeans to furs. Never has this open-closet-door policy proved more beneficial than on the international Fashion Week circuit; who knew it was possible to save on luggage space and double up on style at the same time! Today in Milan , the Hadids took the idea of a shared travel wardrobe to the next level in coordinating off-duty outfits, starting with a very familiar leopard-print coat. We first spotted the piece swinging from the shoulder of big sister Gigi , though in Bella’s defense, she claims she had it first, as she explained in an interview with Vogue.com at the start of New York Fashion Week . Without question, Bella left her mark in bondage-style leather that she wore with ladylike pumps, keeping the bad-girl-about-town vibes in check. An alligator-covered bowler coupled with mirrored sunglasses packed an equally eye-catching finish. Gigi, on the other hand, hit a tonal note in a cozy mohair topper and cool track pants that were cinched with a leather belt. The metal grommet detail at the waist extended to the hardware on her top-handle bag, which was comparatively compact, though no less polished. From a purely practical perspective, Gigi’s optic-white kicks were the more ideal choice for hotfooting it around the Italian city. Chances are they share the same shoe size, too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:19:25.418+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
