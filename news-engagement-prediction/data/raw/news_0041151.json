But military officials say the western side, with its narrow, winding streets, may prove a bigger challenge. \nAccording to Staff Lieutenant General Abdulamir Yarallah the latest attack began well, with the rapid response units capturing the villages of Athbah and Al-Lazzagah before taking Mosul airport. \nHowever, the launch of the new offensive was overshadowed by graphic videos of men in Iraqi security force uniforms carrying out beatings and summary executions on the streets of Mosul. One of the disturbing images showing beatings by men in Iraqi federal police uniforms. Photograph: Facebook \nThe violent scenes, posted on social media pages supporting Iraqi government forces, are reminiscent of Isis’s own propaganda and have been condemned by the UN and human rights groups. \nThe videos threaten not only to tarnish the image of security forces, but potentially to undermine public support for the Mosul offensive, human rights activists said. \n“While this operation has seen so few incidents of abuse compared with earlier operations, it is vital that prime minister Haider al-Abadi takes them seriously when they do come up,” said Belkis Wille, who has documented human rights abuses in Iraq for Human Rights Watch. “We often see the authorities creating investigative committees – we rarely see results. Let’s hope it is different this time.” \nSecurity forces have been broadly welcomed by residents weary of Isis’s brutal rule, and praised for their restraint through months of gruelling urban warfare, defying fears that the assault by Shia-dominated forces on a Sunni-majority city could spark a sectarian bloodbath.

In other videos circulated on Facebook young men are beaten, or forced to imitate animals – one a dog, another made to bleat like a goat. \nThe men abusing the prisoners appear to wear the insignia of various security forces including federal police, the regular army, the counter-terrorism service and militias known as the Popular Mobilisation Forces. \nThe prime minister’s office has launched an investigation into the videos as a precaution, although it insisted it considers them a fabricated slur. “If it is proven that there were abuses, the perpetrators will be handed over to the courts. In other operations there were individuals who committed abuses and … some were sentenced,” spokesman Saad al-Hadithi said. \nMost of the videos and pictures were posted online after the second phase of the Mosul operation started in late December. They stand in stark contrast to matching posts on the official special forces Facebook page, which shows them posing for selfies with newly liberated residents, handing out food and water, and even feeding animals.

The Facebook pages they appear on unofficially document the progress of the campaign. \nThe UN has voiced concern about civilians trapped Mosul, amid reports that they could number up to 650,000. Leaflets warning residents of an imminent offensive were earlier dropped over the west of the city. \nAhead of the launch of the latest operation, Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi said in a televised speech: “We announce the start of a new phase in the operation, we are coming to Nineveh to liberate the western side of Mosul.” \n“Our forces are beginning the liberation of the citizens from the terror of Daesh [Isis],” he added, quoted by Agence France-Presse news agency.
