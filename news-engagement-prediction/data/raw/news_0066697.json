The two star together in The Shack, and Sam tells Newsday being on set with the country superstar was a treat. “He’s the most humble man I ever met,” Sam says. “For someone who’s achieved so much and is that famous, he’s the most down-to-earth man. He told me one day, ‘Sorry I’m so tired, Sam — I had a little gig last night.’ I said, ‘That’s OK.’” \nPosted February 14, 2017 \nThe Avatar star later discovered Tim had played a stadium gig the night before.“I found out that little gig was at some football stadium with thousands of people. I said, ‘You really undersold that, mate,'” the Australian actor said. “But that sums him up — he doesn’t shout it from the rooftops.”Sam and Tim play best friends Willie and Mack in the flick. While Tim’s character also narrates, he and wife Faith Hill are among the country stars who sing on the movie’s soundtrack. The Shack hits the box office March 3. \nCody Alan is the host and executive producer of CMT After MidNite, CMT Radio Live and CMT All Access.
