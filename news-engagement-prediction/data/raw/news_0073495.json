He added: 'There was a rock in the lorry which they could have used or a bottle of urine they could have thrown on us. We didn't think, we acted.' Mr Slowley said he grabbed one of the men and 'held him up against the lorry'. 'He was primed to leg it,' he said. 'I had him at his neck, by his jacket, and he undid the zip but we told them to sit down and wait for the police. The builders grabbed the two men as they jumped from the lorry and stayed with them until armed police arrived at the scene (pictured) The two men, who apparently told the builders they were from Iraq, will now be interviewed by immigration officials. Police are pictured at the scene 'They looked quite young - maybe in their 20s. They were obviously prepared, they had sleeping bags, gloves and scarves.' When police arrived, they asked the lorry driver to search through the vehicle to make sure no one else was inside. Witness Cody Hamilton, who works in the Co-op opposite, saw armed police turn up at the scene. She added: 'It was really shocking.

An Essex police spokesman said: 'Officers attended. Two men have been detained. Police have notified the Border Force.' A spokesman for the Home Office said: 'Immigration Enforcement was contacted by Essex Police. 'Police arrested two men for suspected immigration offences and they will be interviewed by immigration officials. 'Where someone has no right to remain in the UK, we will take action to remove them.'
