The witness said he tried to avoid him whenever he saw him. \nAnother witness also described being attacked at the warehouse. Mahmoud Ayesh suffered three puncture wounds in the chest, one in the flank that damaged his kidney, three in his leg and at least 10 wounds on his arms. \nAyesh said the attacker came out of nowhere. He said he thought he was being punched until he felt blood. \n“I thought at first he was punching me in the chest,” Ayesh told court. “When I felt the warmth of the blood flowing down my body… that’s when I realized he was trying to kill me.” \n“He was saying, ‘I don’t like you’ several times, maybe four or five times… and he kept stabbing me in the chest.” \nAyesh said he was able to fight off the attacker by kicking him and managed to run away. He gathered with a group of people who started performing first aid on each other when the attacker came towards them again. \n“People were scared of him and I think he was enjoying it,” Ayesh told court. \nCrown prosecutor Kim Goddard asked him why he felt that way. \n“He was smirking,” Ayesh said. \nWitness Axamed Mektar also recalled the attacker saying “he hated us” during the rampage.
