That trial was done successfully and a final decision was to be taken after Republic Day. \n\nThe aviation ministry is keen to extend no-stampimg to more airports. The aim then is to stop stamping boarding cards too and take the next step to introduce biometric boarding.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T15:49:18.135+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
