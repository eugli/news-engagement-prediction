Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nRyan Thomas is being lined up for this year's series of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! \nThe former Coronation Street actor - who was known for portraying Jason Grimshaw - is at the top of the bosses' wish list for the next installment of the creepy-crawly show after his younger brother Adam proved a hit with viewers last year. \nA source close to the 32-year-old actor told The Sun: \"There was speculation before Adam went into the jungle [last year] that maybe Ryan would do it - but circumstances went against that and Adam went in and did brilliantly. \n\"Ryan would be superb in the jungle and there has never been a family member following a family member into the outback ever in all the series. Ryan's being eyed up for the new series (Photo: Can Nguyen/REX/Shutterstock) He'll no doubt win over fans with his physique (Photo: Rex Features) Read More Lads! Adam Thomas and Danny Miller are men behaving badly as they celebrate Emmerdale's NTA win \n\"Fans would no doubt get behind him like they did Adam, and it'd be interesting to see if he reacts to the bushtucker trials in the same funny way.\" \nHowever, producers may have to slap down a large sum of money to coax the hunk to the Australian outback as he's currently across the pond trying to carve out a career in Hollywood. \nRyan said when he announced his decision to leave Corrie to pursue other things Stateside that he was looking forward to doing something new. \n\"I feel like sometimes you go round in circles with storylines and being in a soap is like being in a bubble. Adam was on the show last year (Photo: REX) The brothers are soap rivals \n\"It's time to pop it, test myself and take myself out of my comfort zone.\" \nAnd Ryan - who has seven-year-old daughter Scarlett with his ex-girlfriend Tina O'Brien - will certainly have pressure on his shoulders if he does take on the jungle gig as his brother Adam managed to worm his way to the final last year and ultimately came third place.
