Putting some plants in the dining room might help - at least that's the the hope of a University of Guelph student.\nKaren Shlemkevich is a graduate student at the university's school of landscape architecture, and she's looking at the effects of nature on the eating habits of seniors living in long-term care homes.\n\"What I'm hoping to see is that having the nature in the dining environment will increase their staying there,\" she told The Morning Edition' s Colin Butler. \"So if they're staying there longer and enjoying the space, they will be eating more.\"\nFor the project, she built a green wall made up of plants like irises and coleuses.\nShlemkevich installed the wall Monday at St. Gabriel's Villa, a care facility in Chelmsford, Ont. where it will stay for the next two weeks.\nDuring that time, she will study any effects the plants have on the eating habits of the residents there.\nShlemkevich grew plants like iris and coleus for her green wall. (Karen Shlemkevich)\nShlemkevich worked in the long-term care industry for a decade, and has heard from a number of residents that care facilities often feel institutional and don't feel like home, which can seriously affect their eating habits.\n\"I thought if I brought that nature into the dining room environment, it would also feel more homey, and therefore make the eating experience more pleasant,\" she said.\nShe added that plants have a calming effect and also absorb sound, which can make the dining rooms feel less busy and noisy.\nShe hopes that walls like this will become the standard at homes across the country.\nThe six-week research project is part of her final the thesis to obtain her master's degree.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T21:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:03:16.790+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
