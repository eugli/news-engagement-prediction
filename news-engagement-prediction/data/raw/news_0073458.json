You are in a different place everyday and you meet so many people.\" \n“Sugar” is a genre-bending jam that sounds like a rollercoaster, moving from more stripped down sections of the track focusing on strings to fuller moments when the entire band is playing. It’s a feel good track from start to finish. \nCity of the Sun is hitting the road on tour next month.
