When she was leaving for her house, her friend’s brother offered to accompany her, the girl said. “He took me to a secluded place and forced me to drink a beverage laced with intoxicant,” she said. \nPolice said an autorickshaw driver informed them of the incident after he spotted the unconscious girl lying in a bush by roadside. The accused, identified as Mantu Yadav, had apparently dumped the girl in the bush after raping her and fled, the police added. \nThe accused is an autorickshaw driver, the police said. \nThe father of the victim, who runs a dairy in Vishnupad police station area here, said he was initially reluctant to allow his daughter, who would be appearing for Class 10 CBSE examination next month, to go for the farewell party. “We allowed her to go to school following persistent request by her friend, the sister of the rape accused, who had come to our house on Monday afternoon. We got worried when she did not return by 4pm as promised. In the evening, an unknown caller informed us that our daughter had met with an accident. When we reached the hospital, the police and the doctors told us about the actual incident,” he said. \nHe also demanded capital punishment for the accused. \nGaya senor superintendent of police (SSP) Garima Malik said she immediately set up a special investigating team (SIT), headed by ASP Baliram Chaudhary, to probe the case and ensure the arrest of the alleged culprit. Confirming the arrest, the SSP said the police had been directed to make out a strong case against the accused and submit the chargesheet at the earliest. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:35:10.725+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
