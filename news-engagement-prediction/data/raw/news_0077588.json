And it's important for the media to call to account people who abuse their power, whether it be here or elsewhere.\" \nOn the issue of immigration and Trump's recent attempt to ban travellers from seven Muslim-majority nations, Bush warned that if the U.S. freezes out other countries and turns inward, that would only make it more difficult to fight the Islamic State group and other foreign extremists. \n\"I think it's very hard to fight the war on terrorism if we're in retreat,\" he said.
