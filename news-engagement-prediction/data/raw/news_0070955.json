But they did it with a performance which should galvanise the dressing room and leave the players believing anything is possible. Stones, Sane and Aguero all scored to complete the comeback (Photo: Getty) Read More Manchester City 5-3 Monaco: Sergio Aguero scores twice in Champions League classic - 5 things we learned \nAt times they were ruthlessly picked apart by Monaco as the French league leaders threatened to give City a real chasing. It looked as if City will have to wait for another year to realise their European ambitions. \nBut somehow, through spirit as much as quality, City hauled themselves back into the contest with a never-say-die attitude on a breathless night of high drama at the Etihad. \nIt was an incredible game and if City can produce more high adrenaline performances like this then maybe, just maybe, they can thrill us all the way to European glory. \nIncredibly, Monaco have already scored 111 goals this season. And it’s only February. They were quite simply a joy to watch but it was also open season at the Etihad as City’s defence was embarrassingly bad.

By the end, you were left feeling privileged to even be there to witness one of the most astonishing games. \nCity, having been overrun, refused to buckle and eventually smashed five past Monaco in a game which will leave every fan wearing blue in the stadium feeling lucky to have been there. poll loading Will Manchester City win the Champions League? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:38:32.358+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
