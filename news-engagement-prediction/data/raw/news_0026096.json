Freegate Professional lends a hand to those who cannot access certain web pages due to restrictions, providing a fast and simple way to bypass all those rules. No setup process required The great thing about Freegate Professional is that it doesn't need to be installed, you only need to double-click the executable file to have it up and running. It can also be set to stay hidden in the system tray so it does not take any space on your desktop or task bar. Simple and intuitive interface Its interface is very clean and easy to use and the most important thing is that the application will do most of the tasks without requiring user intervention. Simply put, Freegate Professional automatically detects the browser you use and applies a predefined list of websites that are usually blocked in certain countries. Guarantees fast access to the Internet The software solution scans for multiple proxies servers and connects to the fastest one, but still allows you to choose another one if you experience problems with the default option, as we discovered during our tests. Have navigation history automatically cleared Among the features of Freegate Professional, a pretty useful one can be found in the 'Settings' tab and it enables you to set the application to automatically clean the Internet Explorer history when you exit the program. To end with Overall, Freegate Professional is a great tool for anyone who needs to load websites they're not allowed to access, but keep in mind that its performance pretty much depends on the proxy server you find. Also, the software quite easy to use and comes with enough features to satisfy the needs of the majority of users.
