Manly What it’s really like to be a real housewife Sarah Swain, Manly Daily February 17, 2017 8:18am Real Housewives star ‘depressed’ Real Housewife Lisa Oldfield reports to police\nTHERE’S not much champagne drinking, shopping for designer labels or even free time for Megan Webb.\nAs a ‘real’ housewife of Sydney, from daybreak until late at night she’s taking care of her family, cooking, cleaning, or working.\nMum of three Mrs Webb, of Forestville, revealed more about her life as the Real Housewives Of Sydney — starring two northern beaches identities — starts airing next week on Foxtel’s Arena.\n“There’s not a lot of going out,” she laughed.\nmedia_camera Megan with son Jasper and daughter Coco. Picture: Adam Yip\n“I went to a wedding recently. I haven’t been out for so long, I didn’t know about the lockout laws.”\nMrs Webb is up by 7am. Her children Tilly, 18, Coco, 11, and Jasper, seven, will probably already be awake.\nUnlike the show’s Lisa Oldfield, who has a live-in au pair, she doesn’t have any staff.\nShe’ll help the younger two get ready, including making lunches.\nShe then drives them to Forestville Public School, and then heads to work herself at Aspect Vern Barnett School in Forestville.\nShe works until 3pm and then returns to collect them.\nmedia_camera The cast of Real Housewives of Sydney Picture: Stephen Cooper\n“It’s very convenient, but there’s no time for myself,” she said.\nThen, it’s after school activities such as soccer and dancing, with the children having something on most days.\nThen she has to cook dinner — or resort to a takeaway for the children as well as husband, financial planner Tim, who gets home by 7pm.\nShe often sees one of the show’s stars, Melissa Tkautz, at the supermarket.\n“She’s always glammed up from the minute she steps out of the house, even in Coles,” she said. “I’ve never seen her looking daggy. Who wears stilettos to Coles?”\nmedia_camera Megan cleaning the bathroom. Picture: Adam Yip\nMrs Webb’s dream, if she were a Real Housewives star, would be to have a chef.\n“If you took away the cooking that would make things a lot easier,” she said. “And a nanny would be nice but I’ve never had one.”\nIt’s only when the children go to bed at 8.30pm that she’ll have a chance to watch TV — that’s is if she’s not cleaning or washing, as she does at least one load a day.\nShe can’t remember the last time she had a manicure, and usually dyes her own hair because she doesn’t have time to go to a salon, unlike The Real Housewives, who get glammed up for every shoot and appearance.\nmedia_camera Megan doing the washing. Picture: Adam Yip\nMrs Webb does have the occasional glass of prosecco, but nothing like the Bollinger Oldfield sips on the show.\nShe does have a cleaner for 45 minutes once a fortnight, and an occasional spray tan.\n“It’s my treat,” she said.\nBut despite the women’s unrealistic lives, Mrs Webb can’t wait to see the show.\n“I think it’ll be a bit fake and bitchy, but I love all that,” she said. “I think I’m going to get together with friends and watch the first night.”\nA DAY IN THE LIFE OF A REAL HOUSEWIFE\n● 7am: Gets up, helps children get ready for school, including breakfast and making packed lunches for them.\n● 8am: Takes the two youngest to school in the car, then heads to the school where she works to begin her day\n● 9am: Starts work as a classroom assistant\n● 3pm: Finishes work and heads to collect the children from school\n● 4pm: Takes them straight to an after-school activity such as dancing or football — and one day a week to the local library to get homework done\n● 6pm: Arrives home and makes dinner for the whole family\n● 8.30pm Says goodnight to the children, does a bit of housework and watches TV\n● 11pm: Goes to bed\nDetails: The Real Housewives of Sydney starts on Sunday 26 Feb, 8.30pm Foxtel Arena\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERS AND NEWS ALERTS", "external_links": ["http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/5aebc7546b6a714692e46bc1603bd46c?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storyheader/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/chronicle/ap/latest/assets/img/news-plus.svg", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/da9928afa68191b96eb17e413bbe8964?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0f7d9b6e9ae801ca01512f3b3a318b05?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f6b35439c890f13b761b0f61b180891d?width=1024", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0478cdbb60c9f5f3c9d1a7b7ce34385b?width=650", "http://www.homeimprovementpages.com.au/find_local_tradies", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/18d718c62292a650dea05ce981e0f88e?width=650", "https://s2.wp.com/_static/??-eJytjcEKAjEMRH/IblgU1z2I31K6wbY0aW1Sl/17C64XD56EgQzDmwysxQR2qS0oELseDeu2nyHKAX4BhsK9WsWBAn9gl1mRFdQj9cozFGBcxeVabDOEWjMoUkm9J+AylcydF/BoF6ywBNHd/+WtZZs2DU6MoK3Ovwe+033qRtfxNM3jfJzOl/gC4F5rlQ==", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-metro/templates/components/header/dist/header.css?m=1484889074h", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=135086289853833&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fmanly-daily%2Fnews-story%2F5aebc7546b6a714692e46bc1603bd46c&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fmanly-daily%2Fnews-story%2F5aebc7546b6a714692e46bc1603bd46c", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/5aebc7546b6a714692e46bc1603bd46c?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storymeta/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/spp-api/v1/template?path=components.header.header&exclude-css=false&exclude-js=false&t_product=DailyTelegraph&t_domain=dailytelegraph.com.au&device-channel=desktop&is_front_page=0&show_idaas_login_placeholder=1&v2=1&is_local_news_section=1", "https://pages.e.newsdigitalmedia.com.au/GPCv2/?a=DailyTelegraph", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20real%20life%20of%20a%20%E2%80%98real%E2%80%99%20housewife&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fmanly-daily%2Fnews-story%2F5aebc7546b6a714692e46bc1603bd46c", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/5aebc7546b6a714692e46bc1603bd46c?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storybody/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fmanly-daily%2Fnews-story%2F5aebc7546b6a714692e46bc1603bd46c", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/resource/networksales/exoduscampaigns/campaigns.json?t_product=DailyTelegraph&t_template=s3/networksales-loader/index&td_domain=dailytelegraph.com.au&td_pagetype=articlepage_v2&esi=true&td_channel=desktop&td_section=newslocal/manly-daily", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/networksales/loader/latest/assets/js/exodus_loader-client.js"], "published": "2017-02-16T13:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T08:54:36.879+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
