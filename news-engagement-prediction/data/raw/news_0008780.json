The Grammy-nominated rapper is on hand to support the brand he wears most and now collaborates with—and he's taking his fashion week debut seriously. He's dressed in a lemon yellow T-shirt, white jeans, Air Jordans, and, naturally, a rare vintage Nautica jacket draped over his shoulders. Adjusting his grills in the mirror, he is ready to talk about his plans for the sailing-inspired label and how, at only 19, he's found himself in the enviable position of menswear insider. \nFollowing the success of the rapper's capsule with the American sportswear label for Urban Outfitters , the two parties made it official: Yachty was named a Nautica creative designer. \"I didn't really have anything to do with this.\" Yachty confesses about presentation we're about to see—a reworking the brand's extensive archive of ' 90s sportswear into fresh pieces a wide swath of guys would want to wear. The blinged-out sailboat charm hanging around the rapper's neck, however, was all Yachty and not up for sale (Nautica did make a limited edition T-shirt with the chain screenprinted on it—driving New York teens to queue up at their pop-up last night). We talked to the laid-back multi-tasker about his creative plans for Nautica, his epic windbreaker collection, and how he really feels about the brand's favorite water sport. \nHow did you begin working with Nautica? \nI'd been wearing it, I kept tagging them. I dunno I just kinda got their attention and they hit me up. \nWhat is the one thing you wear more than anything else right now? \nNautica, of course. \nIs there a specific piece of clothing? \nI don't wear anything more than once, most of the time. I try not to wear the same thing twice. I have too many clothes to wear the same thing twice. \nAt this point, how many windbreakers you have? \nI wouldn't be able to tell you. \nDo you ever wear a suit? Do you own a any suits? \nNo, I just got my first suit today. Well it's my second suit. I got three today. One's white and black, one's all black, and one's navy blue. They're for the Grammys. That's why there were three made. I'm not normally big on suits. \nWhat shoes do you think men should wear with a suit? \nI like penny loafers. \nWhich do you think women prefer? A suit or your vintage gear? \nI think women like men in suits. \nWhat about men in windbreakers? \nI don't know. That's a funny question. I don't think men dress to look attractive, I think they dress to look cool. \nWhat's the difference? \nWell to be cool you don't always have to look attractive. \nHow would you describe today's Nautica presentation? \nOh yeah, that's like some sailing shit. Some boat shit. Boathouse with your family. Golfing. Some old man shit. \nDo you sail? \nNah. I have before. That shit is wack. It's hard, well it's not even hard. It just takes a lot of energy. I'm real laid back. \nDo you think there's a difference between what preppy clothes used to be like, and what they're like now? \nYeah. Cause like in the '90s everything was colorful. You could be very preppy. Like polos and shirts tucked in, and sweaters around the neck. That was like rich preppy-type shit. \nDo you think that's changed? \nEverything's changed. Nothing's only for one person anymore. \nWhat is it about Nautica's archives that you wanted to revisit? \nI've never been one for designing until now. I just got so many ideas that feel like they could help make Nautica be bigger and better. Not even better actually, because it's already amazing, but just help attract a different demographic. A different age group. \nIs that partially your role? What do you want them to do differently this year? \nYeah, nowadays. They're very open to my suggestions. I think they should just care about more than one specific lane of the lifestyle. I want to see Nautica just be more out there, catering to everyone. And more colors. \nWhat's the coolest thing you see young kids doing in fashion now? \nI think it's cool that fashion is no longer for a certain age group. You know, designers are all ages. Your clothes don't have to be in a store for you to make a ton of money. You can sell them online now. So it's just all open, it's free, it's creative, and it's accessible.
