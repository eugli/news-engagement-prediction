It began with a snippet of two kids fighting over an Eggo, which obviously has only one rightful owner â€“ Eleven. Speaking of Millie Bobby Brown, she is shown in the preview breathing heavily while upside down, as fresh blood runs from her nose. Is it too optimistic to think the blood is from taking those kids' Eggos? \nSeemingly ready to battle evil once again, Eleven's friends are dressed in Ghostbusters costumes. Hopefully that's enough protection to fight whatever beast is coming from the sky.
