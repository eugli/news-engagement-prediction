Save Nick Mortimer/GNS Science Research Institute \nWho knew that finding hidden continents was a trend? Researchers now say they've confirmed the existence of Zealandia, a giant land mass (roughly two thirds the size of Australia) hiding in the Pacific Ocean -- as you might guess, New Zealand is its peak. Academics have long suspected that the mass was a continent, but they only recently gathered enough information to make a convincing case. \nElevation and shape are obvious clues, but there are other factors . The crust is noticeably thicker than the ocean floor, for example, while the geology is distinct from other areas. Evidence of geological similarity surfaced early in the 20th century, when scientists noticed continental geology in rocks both in New Caledonia (at the north edge of Zealandia) and islands near New Zealand. \nThe question is, will Zealandia be widely recognized as a continent? The researchers are sticking to observable data and aren't speculating, but there's still a tendency to think of continents as being mostly above water. Even if it isn't broadly acknowledged, though, the findings help fill in more details surrounding the break up of the supercontinent Gondwanaland. Zealandia is estimated to have split off from Australia some 80 million years ago, and we now know that it never entirely went away -- it just sank below the waves.
