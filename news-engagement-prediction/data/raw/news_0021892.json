Clark St., police said.\nThe vandal got out of a dark-colored SUV, possibly a Toyota Highlander, and placed several swastika stickers on the front doors, police said. Then he took a metal object and smashed the front glass windows.\nWright was identified as the vandal after anonymous information was provided on a tip line to Area Central detectives and he was identified on surveillance video, police said. He was arrested about 11:45 a.m. Tuesday as he left a home in the 2100 block of South Loomis.\nWright is scheduled to appear in bond court Thursday, police said. His home address was not known Wednesday afternoon.\nAn evidence technician removes two swatiskas stuck to the front door of the Chicago Loop Synagogue early Saturday. | Network Video Productions\n Chris Pension bill fails—leaders still sold on passing ‘grand bargain' # Chicago Loop Synagogue stuart wright Chicago", "external_links": ["https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/16sclark.jpg?w=529&#038;h=300", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/chriskennedyvideo-e1486581765822.jpg?w=100", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/16sclark.jpg?w=754", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/wright-stuart-31-e1486589011106.jpg?w=100", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/takeover-012116_4_58733037-1.jpg?w=100", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/trump020217.jpg?w=100", "http://wp.me/p7fJAs-22nm", "http://wp.me/p7fJAs-21oX", "http://wp.me/p7fJAs-21yQ", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/16sclark.jpg?w=529&h=300", "http://www.youtube.com/embed/amjopJAMoWM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/16sclark.jpg", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/16sclark.jpg?w=150&h=85"], "published": "2017-02-08T23:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:24:28.231+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
