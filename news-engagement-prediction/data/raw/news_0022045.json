It's a show based on a comic book character that has, in the 32 years since he was created in The New Mutants #26 by Chris Claremont and Bill Sienkiewicz, been both emblematic of both superhero comics at its very best, and comics at their absolute messiest. From minute one, Legion appears as though it could be the same thing for superheroes on television: a new peak for the now-ubiquitous category of entertainment, or an incoherent—albeit beautiful—disaster. Legion is an intentionally obtuse television series—portrayed largely from the perspective of a man who believes he is mentally ill, but in fact might have impossible powers—but it's more fascinating than frustrating, mostly because that obfuscation is integral to the character it's exploring. \nLegion is the codename given to David Haller, a young man born with almost infinite power and an almost infinitely broken mind to come with it. David first appeared in a three-part story in The New Mutants —a sister comic to The Uncanny X-Men , focusing on a younger class of mutants trained by Professor Charles Xavier after the X-Men reached adulthood and became more or less autonomous—in which a psychic episode afflicting the then-catatonic Haller blew up the lab of X-Men alley Dr. Moira McTaggert, drawing Xavier and his New Mutants to investigate. The resulting story involves Xavier—who soon finds out Haller is his son—and the mutants embarking on a psychic journey through Haller's broken mind, which unfolds into a commentary on the Arab-Israeli conflict. It's slowly revealed that Haller's powers manifested and mind fractured at the same time—when, as a boy, he became the sole survivor of a terrorist attack, and absorbed the mind of the terrorist leader into his own. As a result, although Haller's powers protect him, he became catatonic, with multiple personalities taking up residence in his brain—including that terrorist, Jemail Karami. What starts as a trippy psychodrama becomes a fable about empathy and healing, as it's revealed that Karami, through Haller's mind, has a change of heart, and works to posthumously mend his ways and help repair Haller's damaged psyche. He is, ultimately, along with the New Mutants, unsuccessful, and Haller—now awake—will spend the rest of his life fighting disparate personalities for control. EDITOR’S PICK The Man Who Saved Luke Cage From Marvel Obscurity \nThe way David Haller works is like this: He has, more or less, an infinite array of superhuman powers, but he also has just as many disparate personalities vying for control of his mind, and each of those personalities is tied to one of his superpowers. Following the relatively contained introduction to his character, Haller would resurface in X-Men stories, often to ridiculous ends, like creating entire alternate timelines thanks to his unstable, yet unlimited, power. He would also appear in one of the very best X-Men stories, X-Men: Legacy by Simon Spurrier and Tan Eng Huat, which moved Haller's mental illness to the forefront as he tries to reassert control over his mind while also coping with the death of his father, Charles Xavier, and trying to find a unique, proactive way of furthering his father's dream of mutant and human coexistence. \nDavid Haller is, simply put, a mess of a character that most comics writers should leave alone, let alone TV writers. But he also presents a unique opportunity, one that Legion showrunner Noah Hawley is very clearly seizing upon: The chance to make the most distinct and cerebral TV adaptation of superhero fiction yet. While Haller is, technically, an offshoot of the larger X-Men narrative, little of what makes him compelling is necessarily dependent on the iconography of the X-Men being very prominent. It's a comic book show that doesn't have to give much of a shit about comic books. \nIn fact, it's probably better if you watch Legion without looking for connections to comics or X-Men films. The basic premise behind the character of David Haller leaves incredible leeway for anyone looking to do an adaptation of his story, and Hawley and co. lean the hell into it. Dan Stevens, playing Haller, is twitchy and magnetic, always unsure if what he's seeing is real or not, desperately trying to keep his past traumas from bleeding out into the real world and wreaking havoc on real people. That uncertainty is passed on to viewers—you can never really be sure of anything in Legion , and there's no telling whether or not it will work out or make sense in the end. You'll definitely want to find out, though. \nLegion premieres February 8 at 10 p.m. on FX.
