The Imam said she passed away on January 22, 2017, five days before President Trump instituted the travel ban.\nHager had reportedly told FOX 2 that his mother was stopped from returning to the U.S. for medical treatment after visiting her in Iraq, causing his mother to pass away while he returned to America. Hager said he was traveling with a niece, two nephews, and his mother, 75, all of whom held green cards.\nHager had blamed President Trump for the death of his mother, claiming that had she not been held in her home country she would have survived.\nFOX 2 reached out to Hager for comment but was not been able to reach him.\n  Issues and tagged Iraq , Trump Administration  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T23:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:57:14.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
