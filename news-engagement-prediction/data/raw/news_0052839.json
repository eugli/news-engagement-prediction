By: FE Online | Updated: February 21, 2017 4:39 PM Reliance Jio’s entry into the telecom space has forced the incumbent players to relook at their market positions and consolidate their operations to survive the competition. \nWith Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani announcing that on Reliance Jio all domestic voice calls will always remain free and there will be no roaming charges, telecom experts have given a thumbs up to this move and raised concerns for its incumbents. Former Airtel COO amd ex- Micromax chairman Sanjay Kapoor on Tuesday said, “Reliance Jio tariff plans ‘super bonanza’ for consumers. The incumbents will be under tremendous pressure after this announcement”. While Rajan Mathews, DG, COAI hailed it as a good news, Sudip bandhopadhay, Inditrade Capital said “incumbents now have a chance to prove themselves”. \nReliance Jio’s entry into the telecom space has forced the incumbent players to relook at their market positions and consolidate their operations to survive the competition. Vodafone India and Idea Cellular have said that the two companies are in talks to merge their operations, and are learnt to be looking to seal the deal in a month. Reliance Jio has led to the established operators drastically cut tariffs – as much as by 66% – in order to retain their customer base, and has put the entire sector under tremendous pressure of choosing between protecting margins and user base. \nMeanwhile, Ambani also announced the launch of Jio Prime membership programme, that will open from March 1 and will remain open till March 31. Those who are already subscribers and those who join Jio before March 31, join a year plan for a fee of Rs 99. Jio Prime members can continue to benefit from Jio New Year offer for another 12 months, the scheme will be for a price of Rs 300/month for another full year. More value plans will be announced for Jio Prime members soon and details will be provided on My Jio app. Jio Prime members can also get the Jio media bouquet service free for a full year till March 31, 2018. Jio Prime members will also benefit from a line up of deals from Jio and its partners. \nALSO READ: Reliance Jio tariff plans to begin from April 1; domestic voice calls to any network will remain free \nHe also said that Reliance Jio Infocomm has added 100 million subscribers on its network, in less than six months of the launch of its mobile telephony services, which introduced a barrage of free data and voice offerings in order to grab the market share. “Today, just 170 days since its launch, Jio has crossed the 100 million customer mark on its 4G LTE network! Jio has added, on average, nearly 7 customers on its network every second of every day. To all our customers, I say thank you”. \n\nReliance Industries, India’s largest business conglomerate, launched its much awaited telecommunication venture Reliance Jio Infocomm last year with a whopping Rs 1.5 trillion investments to start with, mainly in building high-speed internet infrastructure over the new 4G/LTE network across the entire country. It topped it up with an announcement of a further investment of Rs 30,000 crore in December. Please Wait while comments are loading...
