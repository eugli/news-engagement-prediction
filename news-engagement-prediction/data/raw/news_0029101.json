Article continues below \nIn doing so, the 35-year-old became the oldest player to win a Grand Slam for 45 years - but how does he do it? \nThat's the question everyone keeps asking themselves. Federer is undoubtedly in the twilight years of his career yet he keeps producing the goods.

Deep down that's really important.\" \nOn having a smart schedule, he added: \"I always make sure I have enough breaks, enough holidays, build up, tournaments, practice. The whole thing needs to come together. \n\"Maybe it's tricky coming back the first couple of matches, but once you're in, it's a big advantage you had time off. \n\"It's not easy to sit on the sidelines to see four, eight to 10 guys winning tournaments while you're sitting at home working out. Working out doesn't give you a whole lot of points.\" \nAnd on having a loving family, he concluded: \"I definitely think [family life] has had a positive effect on me as a person and my life, as a player. My relationship with my wife, it's been wonderful.\" \nSo there you have it: if you want to win 18 Grand Slam titles and become the greatest tennis player of all time, follow those three steps. \nBut you will also have to be really, really good at tennis. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
