The total duty and Goods and Services Tax (GST) evaded amounted to about S$1.1 million and S$83,340, respectively, the agencies added.\nSingapore Customs was alerted and its officers subsequently arrested six Malaysian men, aged between 19 and 28, in a warehouse in Tuas South Avenue 10, according to the press release.\nInvestigations are ongoing, the authorities said. \nBuying, selling, conveying, delivering, storing, keeping, possessing or dealing with duty-unpaid goods are serious offences under the Customs Act and the GST Act. Offenders can be fined up to 40 times the amount of duty and GST evaded and/or jailed for up to six years. Vehicles used in the commission of such offences are also liable to be forfeited.\n- CNA/kk\nEmail More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T20:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T08:25:54.878+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
