A “utopia for realists” is a contradiction in terms, and Rutger Bregman, a highly regarded, media-savvy young Dutch historian, is happy to inhabit that contradiction. \nAt its best, his book is freshly written, witty and contrarian. The worst utopian literature tends to obliterate its subject with description, either implausibly (lemonade seas) or boringly. The worst political “realism” defers to the market as the benchmark of all wisdom. Bregman does neither. His aim is to convince us that an alternative to what we see today is achievable – a new society can be created with “visionary” ideas that are wholly plausible and possible to implement. The end of capitalism has begun Read more \nIf the book contains little news, it makes the old feel new. Venerable leftwing causes such as affordable housing, and a reduction of the working week, are refurbished with new data, expert interviews and historical anecdotes. Myths about the poor, migrants and GDP are ritually slaughtered with gusto. And if some of what Bregman proposes is uncontroversial enough to be policy – as deficit-spending and universal basic income already are in Canada – the book tries to radicalise these ideas and push them beyond the current liberal mainstream. It is a welcome sign of life in the reformist imagination. \nThere are points in the book where journalistic flair doesn’t quite smooth over the contradictions. When we are told, for example, that “history is not a science that serves up handy bite-sized lessons for daily life”, it feels like unconscious self-mockery: much of the book is precisely about taking handy bite-sized lessons from history. And the lessons are not always the right ones. \nFor instance, Bregman takes a revisionist look at the Speenhamland poor relief system, introduced in Britain in 1795, as part of his argument for a universal basic income. He blames negative myths about that system for Richard Nixon’s failure, in a different age and continent, to implement a guaranteed minimum income. Yet as he rightly points out, borrowing from the sociologists Fred Block and Margaret Somers, Speenhamland successfully reduced poverty – and not at the expense of wages or productivity. He is mistaken to claim that under the system “everybody in need had a right to relief”; it was a wage subsidy for the “industrious” not the unemployed. The policy that Nixon implemented, working tax credits, was closer to the actual Speenhamland system – as are many workfare-style policies. \nBregman’s arguments for a universal basic income are seductive. In an age of precarity, we want security. When welfare states turn punitively moralistic, we want independence. But he glosses too swiftly over the fact that one of the intellectual authors of Nixon’s minimum income plan was the neoliberal ideologue Milton Friedman . This is significant not just because it makes clear there are rightwing versions of the policy he favours, but in indicating how, in general, Bregman tends to ignore the way utopian aspirations are so often appropriated and turned into their opposites. \nThis is where anti-utopianism, or “realism”, derives its ideological power. It is not just that welfare becomes surveillance, liberty becomes starvation, and flexibility becomes precarity. The entire socialist project, not to mention dozens of national liberation struggles, suffered a grotesque perversion symbolised by Stalinist dictatorships. Haunting Utopia for Realists are the ghosts of epochal leftwing defeats – unnoticed by its author and never exorcised. \nAll of Bregman’s ideological weapons are drawn from the side of optimism and potential: what could be done with the tremendous powers of 21st-century capitalism – a “fantastic engine for prosperity” – if only there was the political will to achieve it. And he turns those weapons against unnecessary cruelty, overwork, authoritarianism and bigotry. His thinking is buoyantly Whiggish, opening with the assertion that “everything was worse” in the past – and so, by implication, everything might be better in the future. \nThe ideas advanced are less interesting as policy than as examples to play with, and whet the political imagination. They affirm that creative thinking about politics is possible: there is an alternative. Bregman’s wary admiration for the success of neoliberal ideologues Friedrich Hayek and Friedman shows how much he thinks can be achieved through imagination and political will. \nHe leans, however, too much on political innocence. One would never think, reading this book, that with the great productive powers of modernity come great powers of destruction: that “enlightened earth”, as Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer put it after the second world war, “radiates disaster triumphant”. The shadows of two global conflicts, the Holocaust, colonialism, nuclear annihilation, fascism, Stalinism and imminent eco-death necessarily fall on any book so enthusiastic about modernity, but they are never acknowledged. What could be done with the great powers of 21st-century capitalism if only there was the political will to achieve it? \nThe book is also fatally Eurocentric. All of the solutions it offers are for the rich nations: the “Land of Plenty” as Bregman calls it, in a pointed riposte to austerity logic. It is true he discusses opening those rich nations’ borders: a good idea supported by good arguments, though he frames it in terms of western “guilt” over poverty in the global south. But everything is centred on the agency of Europeans and North Americans. If that is to be the starting point, then surely one should at least broach the role of international financial institutions, trade agreements, war and terror, climate change, financialisation and global stagnation. It is strange for a utopian to have next to nothing to say on the issues now turning political systems upside down. \nThis lack of insight is symptomatic of an unwillingness to acknowledge deep structural impediments to the viability of the “utopian” agenda. A 15‑hour working week, for example, is an excellent idea. Bregman presents a strong argument that productivity gains from a less stressful work life would offset the losses, and allow people the much better quality of life that polls suggest they prefer. This is a great improvement on those arcadias, such as in William Morris’s News from Nowhere , predicated on everyone enjoying work. \nBut the idea is more radical than Bregman seems to acknowledge. For a government to pass a law supporting such changes would infringe on the ability of corporations to control investment and employment decisions. They would furiously resist such anti-competitive, anti-profit measures, particularly in an era of sluggish growth and scarce profitable investment opportunities. A range of institutions such as the European Union and World Trade Organisation would apply pressure and sanctions. How to deal with that? Where will the utopian counter-power come from? \nThis is the mixed blessing of a bracing, vigorous book such as Bregman’s. A controversialist tends to want to smother contradiction in deceptively straightforward elegance. But it would be better to keep the contradiction in play. The problem is that Bregman doesn’t take his dreams seriously enough to do so. Lack of “realism” allows his dreams to be infectious, but lack of seriousness undermines their persuasive power. \nIt’s a pity because these cautious steps toward utopian thinking are necessary. Utopias are placeholders for human desires. Without them, thwarted longing turns reactionary. “A world without utopias,” according to the historian Enzo Traverso, “inevitably looks back”. The poisonous cultural nostalgia of Trump and Ukip draws strength from the absence of utopian projects. So Bregman’s utopia for realists is admirable in many ways. But it is also a little like a decorative paper umbrella: gorgeous, but useless in the rain. And it is an abundance of rain that falls on us today. \n• Utopia for Realists is published by Bloomsbury.
