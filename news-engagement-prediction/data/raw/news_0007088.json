I reached my goal Dec. 24, 2016,” says Hinchberger, who lives in Hiram.\nPersonal life: “I am a teacher at Dobbins Middle School in Paulding County. This is my 23rd year in education. I am married to Dave Hinchberger. We have been together 16 years in June. I have three sons: Clay, Kyle and Trey. I also have two stepsons: Jonathan and Ian.”\nLeeAnn Hinchberger weighed 185 pounds in June 2015. CONTRIBUTED BY LEEANN HINCHBERGER For the AJC Turning point: “I was a smoker ever since I was 16. At the school where I teach, one of our custodians was a very dear friend. We found out he had lung cancer in October of 2015. He passed away in January of 2016 and I decided that enough was enough. I quit smoking — put them down and never picked them up again. I decided that I was not going to quit smoking and be fatter than I was already. So, I joined Weight Watchers and never looked back … I decided I was worth it.”\nDiet plan: Breakfast is eggs or turkey with fruit and cheese. Lunch is a salad, fruit and a sandwich. Dinner is chicken, fish or beef, vegetables and brown rice. She drinks 64 ounces of water daily, adding enhancers to flavor it up.\nExercise routine: “I was never an athlete, but I decided that I needed to move more. So I began to walk. I am a member of the turtle club — I don’t walk fast, but I move. I walk every weekday at school in my school gym at 6 a.m. I usually log 3 miles and make sure I have at least 10,000 steps a day. I am addicted to my Fitbit .”\nBiggest challenge: “My biggest challenge was that I didn’t ever exercise. I had to find something I enjoy, and walking was the key. I now have done many 5K events and am planning to walk the Peachtree (Road Race) this year.”\nHow life has changed: “The biggest change is that I had to get an entirely new wardrobe. I have gone from a size 14-16 to a size 8-10. That has been a lot of fun. I also feel so much better. I never realized how bad I felt with the extra weight and smoking until I was in such better health. The difference is remarkable. My Weight Watchers leader … was so instrumental with her motivation and kindness. My husband, Dave, has been my biggest cheerleader. This wonderful man took it upon himself to create my very own walking path at my house that goes around our property. He wanted me to have a safe place to walk during the summer when I was not able to be in the school building. This path is something else — it has twinkle lights, decorations and is always maintained by him to make my exercising easier.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T16:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:38:12.653+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
