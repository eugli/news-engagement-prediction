I stood on the sidelines and peered through the racers streaming by to catch a glimpse of my boyfriend. It was March 15, 2014, and Blake was running Washington, D.C.’s Rock 'n' Roll Marathon. For months, I’d watched him haul himself out of the cozy warmth of home to cut through fall and winter’s increasingly icy winds, getting closer to his goal with each step. I was overcome with emotion from the second the starting gun sounded. As the race came to a close and I edged toward the finish line, someone caught my eye. A black woman, her bib indicating that she was running the half-marathon, moved determinedly toward the finish line. This woman looked tired —the kind of exhaustion you feel in your bones, the kind that only comes after fighting desperately for something, and exactly the kind that had always kept me from running in the first place. As she neared, a group next to me—her family, I assumed—erupted into cheers. Pride radiated off the celebratory group, this huddle of brown-skinned people rooting for one of the few brown-skinned people I’d seen in the race all day. I thought of this woman often when training for my first race , a 10K, two years later. I didn’t know a single thing about her except that, like me, she was a black woman who had decided to enter the largely white sport of running. Because of that, I felt a bond. If she could do it, I could do it. And I did. That “we black women are in this running thing together” vibe helped me reach my goal, but it can be hard to find. The group Black Girls RUN! wants to change that. The organization gives black women across the nation a ready-made running community. Launched in 2009, Black Girls RUN! now has over 27,000 followers on Twitter and Instagram each, and over 197,000 likes on Facebook . They offer branded merchandise and training programs, and they recently got into the world of podcasting . Most importantly, they have over 120,000 members in 73 running groups sprinkled all the country. “When we started, there were so few minorities running and so few women running,” Ashley Hicks-Rocha, 33, co-founder of Black Girls RUN!, tells SELF. “Not even just black women—it was still a space of Steven Prefontaine and Jeff Galloway—you always think of white guys in short shorts running distance races.” Hicks-Rocha started running in 2006, soon after graduating from Middle Tennessee State University. Although she’d played soccer in college and always considered herself an athlete, she quickly realized staying fit after college would be different. “In sports, you’re always training for something, so this idea of just working out was so different,” she says. Along with lifting weights , she decided to start running—and at first, she wasn’t a fan. “I didn’t like it at all. I was like, ‘This is kind of boring,’” she says. “But after a little bit of time, I started to get that runner’s high , and it stuck.” That was enough to inspire Hicks-Rocha’s friend, Toni Carey, 33, co-founder of Black Girls Run!, to start pounding the pavement as well. The two had grown close in college, when Hicks-Rocha was president of their sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha, and Carey was the treasurer. Although they were both hooked on running, there were the usual challenges that come with being a minority trying to gain access to a majority white space. “It was everything from going out to a running group and not feeling welcome to doing road races and looking around like, ‘I’m the only brown person out here,’” Carey says. The puzzled reaction from friends and family only reinforced that Carey and Hicks-Rocha were seemingly going against the grain. “In our community, distance running is not widely accepted as a way to work out.... You just don’t see [African-Americans] running long-distance,” Carey says. “The majority of my friends who did run were sprinters or hurdlers, so I feel like early on, you’re taught that this is your lane.” The pair decided to bring visibility to the fact that black women can and do run for miles on end. “During an epic Yahoo messaging session at work one day, we were like, 'We should start blogging about our experiences,'\" Hicks-Rocha says. \"From there, Black Girls RUN! was born.” Courtesy of Black Girls RUN! The BGR! Indianapolis team. Looking back, the duo realizes that the blog hit at just the right time. In a nation still reeling from the recession, people responded well to the idea of a free way to work out. The blog's inception also coincided with a rising tide of natural-hair acceptance. “You could have spent all day in a salon getting your hair done, so just going to sweat it out was not ideal,” Hicks-Rocha says. “When you wear your hair naturally, you don’t have to worry about it [during exercise]. It’s liberating .” At first, they thought mainly friends and family, plus a couple of strangers, were reading the blog. But they soon realized they’d sparked something bigger. In 2011, they uploaded a blog post saying they’d be running the Publix Georgia Marathon, and anyone who happened to be reading could join in. “We didn’t think anything of it, but when we got there, there were women from all over the country who came to meet us,” Carey says. “At that point, we were like, ‘Whoa, we’re on to something.’” There was clearly a void in the running world, and the BGR! team rolled out local running groups across the country to fill it. “There’s this idea of things we—black people—‘do,’ and we ‘didn’t’ run,” Hicks-Rocha says. “But you saw this movement that said, 'Hey, this is something we do.'” They're right—and the numbers prove it. Between BGR!'s explosive growth and the creation of groups like Black Men Run , which spread from one meet-up in 2013 to 50 nationwide groups today, running is becoming an increasingly diverse sport. In fact, while only 1.6 percent of runners in the U.S. identified as African-American in 2011, in 2015 that number jumped to 8 percent, according to a survey by Running USA . Staying active is especially important in the black community because of the obesity epidemic, Carey explains. Over 37 percent of black men 20 years or older are obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , and that number rises to 56.9 percent of black women 20 and above. (For reference, 34.3 percent of white men in the same age group are obese , while 36.2 percent of white women are.) Black people are the group most commonly affected by obesity in this country. Obesity's negative health effects ripple outward, boosting a person's chances of everything from diabetes to high blood pressure to heart disease to stroke. One of BGR!'s main goals, both co-founders explain, is beating back these odds step by step. Courtesy of Black Girls RUN! BGR! team members on a cruise in 2016. Heading up a fast-growing organization has mainly been smooth sailing for BGR!'s founders, with one exception. There has been some backlash—the type many minority-centered groups receive when carving out a space for themselves. “One of the challenges we face is being accused of being divisive or [Black Girls RUN!] being reverse racism ,” Carey says. Companies interested in sponsoring the group have even suggested dropping \"Black\" from the organization's name. In response, Carey and Hicks-Rocha turn these critiques into a “teachable moment,\" Carey says, explaining the obesity crisis BGR! is meant to target. “We’ve always been really committed and not ashamed of saying, ‘No, this is for our community.’” Hicks-Rocha notes that more non-black people have supported the group than criticized it. Plus, as both co-founders explain, women of all races are welcome to join, and many have. “One of the best parts is being able to transform the face of the running community,” Carey says. “You see way more women running now than you’ve ever seen before, and it’s much more diverse and accessible and welcoming than when we first started.” There’s really only one BGR! rule, Hicks-Rocha tells me: No men allowed. “We want to keep this as a safe space for women to unite together,” she says. “It’s a sisterhood.” Sisterhood. This word comes up a lot when discussing BGR!, especially with devoted members. Adina Crawford, 52, started running around seven years ago. Although she didn’t grow up exercising, she wanted to make a change after losing her mom and step-brother to cancer and her father to dementia. “I was like, ‘You need to kick it in gear, stay active, and ward off what you can for as long as you can,’” Crawford tells SELF. Courtesy of the subject Adina Crawford. Crawford works a stressful job as a civilian manager at a police department. She depends on running, and BGR! by extension, to take care of herself. “When I run, I feel like I’m in my own oasis,” Crawford says. “I just continue to say to myself, ‘You’re doing this for you—it doesn’t matter how fast you are or how slow you are as long as you’re moving.’” Now, she’s a BGR! ambassador for the D.C. area and even won a leadership award from the group. Just as the BGR! community has motivated her through the years, Crawford now sees it as an honor to uplift others in the group, too. “It’s about the fellowship, camaraderie, support, and energy that each of us gives one another,” she says. Black Girls RUN! has blazed a trail, and it will only continue to grow from here. Their rising popularity is thrilling. “We always joke that we’re kind of working ourselves out of a job,” Carey says, before adding: “Seeing obesity statistics lower [is one of our goals] for sure. We want the idea of running—and living a healthy lifestyle—to be second nature.” From here, the team is focusing on rolling out more programs, delivering more merchandise, and reaching current BGR! members and new ones in various ways, like their podcast. “One big thing for us is moving into a space of talking more about mindfulness,” Hicks-Rocha says. “The beauty of it is that it goes hand-in-hand with working out. Self-care and self-love, that’s what working out should be about.” If you'd like to get involved with Black Girls RUN!, go here to become a member and find your local running group.
