Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThe wife of former UKIP leader Nigel Farage appeared without her wedding ring today hours after it emerged her husband had been sharing a London bolthole with a female French politician. \nGerman-born Kirsten Farage, who has previously been photographed wearing a ring, refused to answer questions at the couple’s family home in Kent today. \nBut there was mounting speculation about the state of their marriage after it emerged Mr Farage, 52, has been living under the same roof as Laure Ferrari, 37, at a £4million 'bachelor pad' in west London. \nMs Ferrari is at the centre of a investigation by Britain’s elections watchdog into UKIP’s use of funding. \nAsked if she could provide details of where her husband was this morning, Mrs Farage simply said: “No”.

Nigel Farage has denied being romantically involved with Laure Ferrari (Photo: Twitter) \nMr Farage has insisted his relationship with Ms Ferrari was professional and that he was not romantically involved with the former waitress. \nAlthough he confirmed he was sharing the Chelsea home with her, he said claims they are having an affair were ‘crackers’. \nHe said: “She is someone who I have worked with and known well for a long time who wanted somewhere to stay for a week that wouldn’t cost her any money. \n“It’s a working relationship, you can inflate that however you want,” he said. \nFears that his marriage could be under strain emerged when Mrs Farage did not take part in the recording of Piers Morgan’s Life Stories featuring her husband two weeks’ ago. \nWhile his parents and brother were present for the intimate television profile, Mrs Farage did not attend the recording or film any clips for the programme.

He has two older sons by his first wife. \nIn 2014 the Mirror photographed Mr Farage hand in hand with a female companion entering a hotel on Malta in the early hours of the morning. \nHe denied any impropriety. \nMr Farage and Ms Ferrari first met in 2007 when she was a waitress in Strasbourg. \nWithin months she was head of public relations for the British delegation to the European Freedom and Democracy group that includes UKIP.

I cannot stop people from fantasising. I am not pleased to be in this situation and I am so sorry it is bringing awful things on Nigel’s life and on my life,” she told the Mail on Sunday. \nMs Ferrari said she was living in London after being forced out her flat when European Parliament stopped the IDDE’s funding. \n“I have no trustworthy friends in London who could have hosted me. I asked and he accepted. He is just trying to be helpful,” she said. \nIn an interview in 2014 she said she entered politics after serving Mr Farage and fellow UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom at a restaurant in Strasbourg. \n“At the time in 2007, I was working in a restaurant in Strasbourg. I met these two MEPs and we started talking about politics. Mr Farage has confirmed he was sharing the Chelsea home with Ms Ferrari (Photo: Tim Anderson/Daily Mirror) \n“The two Brits have no hierarchy and neither of them comes from a political background,” she told EurActiv France. \nThe European Parliament Bureau ruled last year the Alliance for Direct Democracy in Europe had misused EU funding and had to repay €172,655 (£146,696). \nThe UK Electoral Commission has now opened its own investigation into whether UKIP accepted “impermissible donations” from the ADDE and the IDDE. \nAn audit found that ADDE financed polling in the UK between February and December 2105, including pre-election surveys in Thanet South, where Nigel Farage unsuccessfully stood for Parliament, and UKIP target seats Great Grimsby, Thurrock, Rochester & Strood and Cardiff South & Penarth. \nNine opinion polls ahead of the 2015 election and 2016 EU referendum were found to have breached the rules on European party financing. \nExpenditure linked to the services of three consultants was also considered non-eligible by an external auditor and by the Parliament’s administration. \nThe European Parliament had advised the commission that “it has formally concluded that ADDE and IDDE used EU grant funding for the benefit of UKIP in breach of its rules and therefore, these expenses were declared as non-eligible for the financing”. Mr Farage said he was merely helping Ms Ferrari out by letting her stay at the property (Photo: Tim Anderson/Daily Mirror) \nThe Commission said its investigation was ongoing. \nLib Dem MP John Pugh said: “UKIP complain about EU waste but seem to have no problem with misusing taxpayers’ cash themselves. \n“The whole thing smacks of hypocrisy. \n“It’s time for UKIP to come clean about their use of EU funds. \n“If money was misspent then they should pay it back, maybe it could contribute to the missing £350 million a week for the NHS.” \nA UKIP spokesman said: “We have nothing to say on this.” Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T01:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T20:33:06.817+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
