SeaWorld today released estimates on its full-year attendance and revenue. (Orlando Sentinel) Sandra Pedicini ’s revenue and attendance declined in 2016 compared with the previous year, according to estimates the company released Tuesday morning.\nOrlando-based SeaWorld will provide a complete earnings report to investors next week. The company reported the 2016 estimates early, it said, “in connection with a potential debt financing transaction.” \nThe company expects revenues of $1.344 billion, down from $1.37 billion the previous year. The company’s theme and water parks drew approximately 22 million visitors last year. The previous year, they brought in 22.47 million people. \nIn the summer, SeaWorld had said its attendance suffered because of an overall drop in Orlando tourism, especially in Brazilian visitors. \nSeaWorld said Tuesday it expects to exceed the high end of the adjusted guidance provided at the end of last year. \n“We are also exploring a possible debt refinancing transaction in order to improve our capital structure by extending maturities and improving certain other terms of our debt,” Chief Executive Officer Joel Manby said in a press release. \nSeaWorld will report complete earnings the morning of Feb. 28. Executives will discuss them with analysts in a 9 a.m. conference call. \nspedicini@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5240; Twitter @SandraPedicini Caption SeaWorld phasing out killer whale breeding - Orlando News Now \nSeaWorld has announced that it will end the practice of whale breeding. \nSeaWorld has announced that it will end the practice of whale breeding.
