'No to both' \nSir Nicholas, one of the longest-serving Tories in the Commons, told ITV's Peston on Sunday he was not sure about the strength of feeling on the Tory benches against Mr Bercow, but he would not take part in any no confidence vote, should there be one. \n\"I have had an e-mail from both sides of the argument and I replied no to both of them,\" he said. Media caption What John Bercow said to Parliament about Donald Trump \n\"John Bercow has in many ways been a very good Speaker. He does tend to shout off on occasions when it would be better if he didn't.\" \nHe added: \"I will not be taking part in any campaign, one way or another. \n\"I think it is a really undignified and unattractive. The Speaker's office is one of the most important in the country.\" 'Vendetta' \nSeveral Tories have voiced concerns about Mr Bercow's stance on Mr Trump's visit - which he announced without consulting his counterpart in the House of Lords Lord Fowler. Lord Fowler has said Parliament should keep an \"open mind\" on the issue. \nThere has also been unease over Mr Bercow's recent public declaration that he voted for Remain in last year's EU referendum. \nWhen Mr Bercow was first elected, he said he would serve nine years and some Tory MPs have urged him now to clarify his intentions over his future. \nDowning Street has said the issue of Mr Bercow's future is one for Parliament to decide - a position some observers have interpreted as giving ministers the green light to vote against the Speaker should the matter ever come before MPs. \nMr Duddridge's early day motion has no parliamentary force and does not mean the issue of the Speaker's future will be debated in the Commons. \nOpposition parties remain supportive of Mr Bercow, with Labour MP Liz Kendall telling ITV's Peston on Sunday that there was a \"vendetta\" against Mr Bercow from Conservative MPs who \"just don't like him\". \n\"By having this motion of no confidence, I think they may have made a mistake and people may rally round the Speaker. I certainly will be.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T20:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T15:27:16.627+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
