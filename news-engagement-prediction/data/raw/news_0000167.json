He was rushing to pick up his medication when he was caught on camera using the emergency lane at KM13.2 of the Federal Highway near Shah Alam.  \n“He used the emergency lane because he was in urgent need of his medication, which was inside his stalled taxi in Glenmarie. \n“He had not taken his medication for more than 24 hours,” Supt Kamaludin said. \nThe cabbie apparently told the police that he was unaware that an ambulance was behind his Myvi, and only noticed the emergency vehicle after seeing it in the rear-view mirror. \n“He tried to give way to the ambulance, but it was too late,” said Supt Kamaludin.\nPolice fined the cabbie for abusing the emergency lane. \nA video of the incident went viral last week, drawing the ire of netizens.\nThe two-minute-and-five-second video appears to be dashboard camera footage from the ambulance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T12:13:52.132+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
