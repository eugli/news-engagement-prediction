Slot to Georgia Links \nA trio of Georgia players have been recognized for their work both on and off the field for the Bulldogs. Sophomore tight end Charlie Woerner , junior offensive lineman Kendall Baker and sophomore defensive lineman Justin Young have been recognized by UGA football as its student-athletes of the week according to a tweet from the official account on Friday. \nIn his first season of college ball in 2016, Woerner caught five passes for 50 yards and appeared in 12 of 13 games. His primary role was on special teams.' \nCongrats to our Student-Athletes of the week! #ATD pic.twitter.com/OuiCse3Cer Not a member?

He came in and played left guard against Ole Miss earlier in the season when a pair of Bulldog linemen temporarily left the game with injuries. The Atlanta native will compete for playing time at tackle and guard in 2017. \nYoung redshirted in 2015 but did get his first taste of college ball last season. The Loganville native had had six total tackles, a tackle for a loss and a quarterback hurry. \nThe Bulldogs are currently in the midst of winter workouts with spring practice set to begin somewhere around the middle of March. \n(What's next for the Bulldogs?
