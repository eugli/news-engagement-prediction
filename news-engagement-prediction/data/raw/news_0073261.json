And the development came at the time, as last week, a division of Isareli defence ministry maintained that the Jewish nation has planned to relax its regulations on export of arms and defence equipment. \nOfficials claim that the MR-SAM, a land-based version of the long-range surface-to-air missile (LRSAM) for the navy, will envisage 40 firing units and around 200 missiles. \nIndia is Israel's largest buyer of military hardware and the latter has been supplying various weapons systems, missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles over the last few years but the transactions have largely remained behind the curtains.
