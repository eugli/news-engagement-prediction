My friends and I went excitedly to the nearest KFC, queued up and to my epic disappointment, the Chizza is nothing like what we see in the pictures KFC published. \nThe difference in size and lack of toppings is an ultra disappointment. This is not Chizza, this is Cheatzza! How can KFC misrepresent their product to this level, the difference is just too big to be ethical. \nThis case reminds me of when McDonalds launched their salted egg burger to much fanfare and ended up launching a failed product which did not meet customer expectations. KFC just pulled the same stunt and they better improve or Chizza will become a Cheatzza for good. \nRafie A.S.S. Contributor Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
