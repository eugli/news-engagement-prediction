Source: Channel 9\nAfter the cut, Alene’s lukewarm attraction to Simon appeared to skyrocket, with the nurse gushing about how “hot” he looked, saying: “I can’t express how appreciative I am.”\nIt may have all appeared rosy on-screen, but fans on Twitter were quick to slam Alene for being so “shallow.”\nQuote: : “Alene back off! You didn’t marry a good bloke to make him someone else — let him be and find someone who fits your shallow ideals.”\nOthers were a little softer in their approach.\n“Simon you look great! And for the record. I thought you looked great with the curls too.”\nAlene back off! You didn't marry a good bloke to make him someone else - let him be & find someone who fits your shallow ideals 😠 #9Married\n— Kristy (@kristycarson) February 13, 2017 Alene...you will lose a great guy like Simon if you don't stop micro managing him #9married\n— de SPK HAUS (@susiepkmelb) February 13, 2017 \"It's still the same me.\" He's not happy.
