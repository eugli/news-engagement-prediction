A new barrier was set and the benchmark belonged to the best batsman in the world. \nSachin Tendulkar beat all odds to become the first player to score a double hundred in ODIs. \nAFP \nAfter MS Dhoni opted to bat in the 2nd match against South Africa in Gwalior, Sachin was on rampage mode right from the start. Power, timing and precision were present in all his shots. \nRuns were coming in quick time off his bat and that seemed to rub off on the likes of Dinesh Kartik and MS Dhoni as they joined in the party. \nBut the show-stopper was Sachin himself. He reached his century in 90 balls, but sadly more pain was to come for the Proteas. \nAFP \nThe next 100 runs were plundered in 57 deliveries and when he eventually took that historic single in the final over, it was a release from all the tension. \nThe crowd stood as one, the opponents applauded, teammates cheered and the world saw history being made. \nAFP \nMany had come close, but finally the 200 barrier had been breached in ODIs. It was fitting that the best batsman in the world should achieve the feat. \nIndia piled up 401/3. Sachin was 200 not out in 147 balls which comprised 25 fours and 3 sixes. The hosts won by 153 runs to clinch the series. \nSince then many more have scored 200 or more in an ODI innings, but Sachin can always say that he got their first. This would remain the highest individual score in the format until Virender Sehwag broke it in 2011. The current record also belongs to an Indian - Rohit Sharma, who achieved the feat in 2014.
