Crystal Rezzonico.   (Photo: Phoenix Fire Department) \nYou could say that Phoenix Fire Capt. Crystal Rezzonico was a walking warrior.\nIn August, 2009, she suffered horrible injuries after a car travelling nearly 70 miles per hour slammed into Engine 910 as it raced to a house fire in north Phoenix. Slammed smack into the spot where Capt. Rezzonico was belted in.\nThe collision was so explosive that she was thrown from the fire truck, landing on her head and breaking both her ankles. Those who loved her were advised to say their goodbyes as she lay there, in a coma.\nRezzonico, however, wasnâ€™t ready to go.\nShe survived five brain surgeries and endured grueling physical therapy, determined at 49 years old to reclaim her life as best she could.\n\"When I finally woke up and couldn't walk without a walker, couldn't say the words in my head, I knew I had to rebuild my life,\" she would later say.\nSo she did.\nThis mother of two, a Fire Department veteran of 21 years, was back at work within a year. And in her spare time, she shared her story of survival with those who needed to hear it.\nAs the mother of a child who suffered a traumatic brain injury in much the same way as Rezzonico, I can tell you that is no small thing. To hear that there is hope. That life may be forever altered but that you go on as best you can.\n\"Her will was unstoppable,\" according to a statement from the United Phoenix Firefighters. \"Her courage undaunted as she clawed her way back, day by day from what were seemingly insurmountable odds.\"\nFinally, in 2014, Rezzonico was forced to retire, her injuries just too catastrophic to continue.\nOn Saturday evening, after years of suffering and surrounded once again by those who loved her, Capt. Crystal Rezzonico died as a result of those injuries.\nWe throw around words like hero a lot. Here, it applies to a woman who not only battled the odds for years but offered those who were around her a front-row seat to what courage looks like.\n\"Everyone goes through good times, but hard times are the things that give you strength,\" she once said. \"Trauma comes when you least expect it.\"\nCapt. Rezzonico is the first female in the Phoenix Department to die as a result of injuries received in the line of duty.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T04:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:23:05.119+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
