Some officials said bringing a case could prove difficult in part because Flynn may attempt to parse the definition of sanctions. \nFollowing reports that Flynn had discussed sanctions during December phone calls with the Russian ambassador, Flynn resigned on Monday night. President Donald Trump has said he asked for the resignation due to the fact that Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence over the content of those conversations. \nOver the past couple of days, Trump has railed against the press over Flynn’s ouster, calling the ex-NSA a “wonderful man” who was treated “very unfairly” while claiming that the retired general did nothing illegal. The president has also taken to condemning leaks from his administration and the intelligence community that have been the basis for many of these news reports. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T07:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:30:04.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
