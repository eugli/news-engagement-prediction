Like, there's times where in my mind, if I look at the schedule and if I see the Heat is playing someone, say, 'Heat versus Denver,' I'm like, 'Dang, we got Denver?' It's in my mind. I mean, 13 years,\" Wade told Vertical site founder Adrian Wojnarowski . \"And it's not even just me, it's people around me. 'Hey, man, you coming to the city?' I'm like, 'Uh, no, that's probably the Heat. The Bulls are somewhere else.' \"\nWade received a warm ovation on Nov. 10 in his return to AmericanAirlines Arena, the Bulls' lone visit of the season. The Bulls won the season series 2-1, which could come into play as a potential playoff tiebreaker.\n “I look back at those 13 years and I just smile,\" he said on the podcast. \"It's hard to reflect while you're in it. But now that I'm out of those 13 years with the organization, I look back. I think people think that I want the Heat to do bad or people probably think that, 'Oh, he still follows the Heat?' Yes, I follow the Heat. I watch all their games.\nCaption Heat forward James Johnson on his improved season Heat forward James Johnson on his improved season\nHeat forward James Johnson on his improved season\nCaption Heat forward James Johnson on his improved season Heat forward James Johnson on his improved season\nHeat forward James Johnson on his improved season\nCaption Heat guard Goran Dragic on significance of 13-game win streak Heat guard Goran Dragic on significance of 13-game win streak\nHeat guard Goran Dragic on significance of 13-game win streak\nCaption Heat coach Erik Spoelstra after 117-109 loss to Sixers ends 13-game win streak Heat coach Erik Spoelstra after 117-109 loss to Sixers ends 13-game win streak\nHeat coach Erik Spoelstra after 117-109 loss to Sixers ends 13-game win streak\nCaption Heat coach Erik Spoelstra on the team's 13th straight win Heat coach Erik Spoelstra on the team's 13th straight win\nHeat coach Erik Spoelstra on the team's 13th straight win\nCaption Whiteside appreciative of teammates' efforts Hassan Whiteside got the ball when needed against the Bucks.

For that, he thanked his teammates.\n\"I'm checking up on them because at the end of the day, it's always going to be a part of me. Their organization is always going to be my organization in some form and some way because of what I was able to accomplish there and where my career stands. I want nothing but success for them.\"\nWade was particularly candid about not being directly contacted during last summer's free-agency negotiations. He said on the podcast he wasn't sure if Riley's approach wasn't a calculated measure to create the parting, something that resonated beyond overtures from owner Micky Arison , former co-captain Udonis Haslem or Heat coach Erik Spoelstra .\nDion Waiters poised to return for Heat; Richardson moves closer Ira Winderman The Miami Heat could be closer to whole Monday night, with the team reporting that guard Dion Waiters went through Monday morning's shootaround in advance of its game against the Orlando Magic at AmericanAirlines Arena.\nWaiters, who has emerged as a spark to the Heat's revival in recent weeks,...\nThe Miami Heat could be closer to whole Monday night, with the team reporting that guard Dion Waiters went through Monday morning's shootaround in advance of its game against the Orlando Magic at AmericanAirlines Arena.\nWaiters, who has emerged as a spark to the Heat's revival in recent weeks,...\n(Ira Winderman) \"I love Pat and I know he loves me,\" Wade said. \"The fact that we didn't talk, that hurt. And that was my deciding factor.\n\"It wasn't about the Arison family, I know they love me and I know they wanted me there. I know Spo wanted me there. I know Udonis and those guys. But at the end of the day, I didn't hear from the guy I needed to.\"\nWade also shed insight on how the all-consuming Heat culture might not be for every player.\n\"What Pat and Micky have been able to establish in Miami has been incredible and there's some great things about it, and there's some things that are not so great from the standpoint of how controlling it can be at times,\" he said. \"But from a basketball standpoint, it's phenomenal.\"\nWade also spoke of Chris Bosh and Goran Dragic being addressed at a higher level when it came to negotiations, although he stressed he did not begrudge either their contracts.\nIn addition, he made a point of noting Spoelstra success during the Big Three era alongside LeBron James and Chris Bosh, and beyond.\n\"I think what he's been able to accomplish in his short career so far as a head coach has just been remarkable and I don’t think a lot of people give him the credit he deserves,\" he said. \"But, at the end of the day, he doesn't look for that. That's not why he does this. He's one of the great coaches in this game and it all started from him being so stubborn to who he is and what they wanted to do.\"\nAs for the precarious position of a Bulls team that was expected to have a far brighter playoff outlook than the Heat, Wade said, \"There's still time. You hope you can still do it. But time does tick away on you, too. And I've been on teams where . . . the clock did tick out on us.\"\niwinderman@sunsentinel.com.
