He accused protesters of 'reprehensible' behaviour that could 'damage the fabric of democracy' - and said he would be happy to attend a state banquet with Mr Trump. Despite saying he did not 'by and large' agree with the president's views, the cleric said his 'strength of personality' could make him an effective leader. Lord Carey told Christian Today: 'I think that Donald Trump will learn on the job and his rhetoric will be toned down as time goes on. 'He has the strength of personality to be an outstanding President but this is predicated on him acquiring experience and wisdom.' His comments came a day after 4,000 people took to the streets of London to call on Theresa May to end her 'collusion' with President Trump. The demonstration was organised by groups including the Stop the War Coalition, Stand Up to Racism and the Muslim Association of Britain. He accused protesters of 'reprehensible' behaviour that could 'damage the fabric of democracy' - and said he would be happy to attend a state banquet with Mr Trump (pictured) In a separate intervention, Lord Carey hit out at 'progressives' who reserved condemnation for the USA rather than autocratic regimes such as North Korea. Writing in The Sunday Express, he urged Theresa May to continue efforts to build bridges with Mr Trump and praised his vow to prioritise Christian refugees. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has called on Mrs May to cancel the president's state visit until he withdrew his ban on seven predominantly Muslim countries.
