Share via Twitter Dimitrios Kambouris Sofía Vergara knows a thing or two about beauty. The 44-year-old has a track record of slaying the red carpet at awards shows—the hair! the makeup! the gowns!—and she does it all with confidence and poise. And she's in the beauty biz, too. The Modern Family actress is a spokesperson for both CoverGirl and Head & Shoulders, and she's genuinely a fan—and avid user—of both drugstore brands. \"I’ve been buying Head & Shoulders shampoo for more than 20 years, and even when I was living in Colombia, so actually 25 years ago,\" Vergara tells SELF. \"And I love all of the mascara from CoverGirl.\" SELF had a chance to chat with the actress as she promotes Head & Shoulders . Naturally, we had to pick her brain about her beauty and wellness habits. Here's what we learned: She hates working out—but she knows it's good for her. Vergara tells SELF she doesn't really like working out, but she knows hitting the gym helps keep her body working well as she ages. \"I’m aging, and I know that it does make a difference and you can see it in the women and men that work out,\" she says. \"Things start to change, and I’m like the only thing to do is go and take care of it.\" Loading View on Instagram Her Modern Family co-star, Ed O'Neill, motivates her to hit the gym. The person who inspires Vergara to stay active: Her co-star actor Ed O'Neill. O'Neill, who plays her husband on the show, is seriously into fitness. \"Ed is a black belt in jiu-jitsu, and he works out every day,\" she says. \"He's 70 years old and moves like a 40-year-old man. It's impressive to see what exercise has done to him.\" She gets bored if she sticks with the same workout. The actress says she switches up her workouts every six months to keep things fresh. Right now, she's getting into boxing . One workout that's not for her: CrossFit . You won't catch her doing box jumps. \"I can’t do a CrossFit or anything that I have to be jumping because I have very bad knees,\" she says. She's all about balance when it comes to eating. You'll find healthy food in the kitchen Vergara shares with her hubby, actor Joe Manganiello, but you'll also find sweets. \"We have a lot of healthy things, but we keep a balance,\" she says. \"I do have a lot of fruits and vegetables, and we cook fresh meats. But I also have ice cream and dessert and we do that during the weekend. I try to control myself during the week.\" Loading View on Instagram Salt is a no-no the night before a big event. Vergara says awards shows felt stressful at the beginning of her Modern Family career, but now she's confident in strutting the red carpet. As for her awards show prep, she usually gets a facial the week before a big event. And she steers clear of salt the night before. \"I try not to eat salty things the night before because I'm very sensitive to salty things and get really puffy eyes.\" She brings a magnifying mirror to awards shows. What she packs in her purse for awards shows: \"Cell phone, mascara, lipstick, of course, and a little [magnifying] mirror,\" she says. \"I'm losing my sight now—aging!\" Loading View on Instagram Her biggest beauty regret involves sunscreen. \"I started using sunblock when I was very young on my face,\" Vergara says. \"I regret that I didn’t know that you should put it also on your chest and neck.\" Seriously wise words, Sofía. Not only can sunscreen protect you from skin cancer , but it can also slow signs of aging, like wrinkles . As Vergara learned, it's smart to apply sunblock on all parts of your body that will get sun exposure—neck and chest included.
