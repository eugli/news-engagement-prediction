If you did, did you happen to see the following image projected on any buildings? \nA lot of people did, actually, because Hater , a dating app designed to match singles with people who hate the same things they do, projected it on buildings at 15th Street and 9th Avenue and 14th Street and 8th Avenue in Manhattan, plus North 6th and Wythe in Brooklyn. \nWhen we asked Hater for a quote, here’s what we got: \nThere’s a lot of animosity out there, regardless of what side you’re on. We’re just trying to make people laugh. Through humor, hate can turn into love. \nAs it stands right now, it’s almost impossible to know if what really exists between the image’s subjects — Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin — is love, but funny Valentine’s Day gags are a marketing staple , so we have to hand it to the people behind the app. With any luck, people who hate Trump and Putin (or people who hate large-scale marketing stunts!) can unite over the image on Hater. \n[images via Hater]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T05:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:33:00.924+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
