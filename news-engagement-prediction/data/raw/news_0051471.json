United States senators and representatives may earn six-figure salaries for serving in Congress, but politicians in local and state offices sometimes earn less than they would at a minimum wage job, according to salary date compiled by Ballotpedia . \nSalaries for state legislators top $100,000 a year in California, but in many states, politicians earn just a few thousand dollars per year. In Texas, legislators make $7,200 annually, or $600 a month for a job that requires a minimum of 140 days of full-time work every two years. Though the job doesn’t come without its perks — legislators may get pension benefits, health insurance, and per diems to offset expenses when the legislature is in session — the pay is so low that it can make serving as a representative financially difficult for anyone who isn’t already well off. \n“Many lawmakers must be independently wealthy or have flexible jobs that allow them to juggle politics and everyday work. Part-time legislators are also more likely than full-time legislators to be retirees,” according to FiveThirtyEight . They might also be more dependent on lobbyists for advice about legislation. \nThough the idea of raising politicians’ salaries tends to be a non-starter, some believe paying our elected representatives more would be good for everyone. In addition to possibly making it feasible for more people to run for office, research has linked higher politician salaries with less corruption and more attention to citizen concerns (as opposed to those of special interest groups and lobbyists), Politico reported . \nAs it stands now, politician pay varies widely from state to state. Using information from Ballotpedia, we’ve ranked the states that pay their elected representatives the lowest and the highest base salaries.
