Nearly 9,000 people died and more than 600,000 houses, including centuries-old cultural heritage sites, were destroyed.\nNearly two years after the quake, the worst to have hit the Himalayan nation in eight decades, people in rural areas, the most severely affected, are still living in improvised sheds or under tin roofs.\nDespite the international community's pledge to rebuild the country, the promised money has yet to reach those in need.\nAccording to Cold Feet Foundation Nepal, a local NGO, people have so far received only $500 out of the $2,000 promised by the government in compensation to rebuild their homes.\nNepal is one of the least developed countries in Asia , with per capita income comparable with the poorest countries in the world. Rebuilding is an onerous task and uncertainties over regulatory mechanisms and new building codes have further delayed the reconstruction process.\nThousands of Nepalese have now endured two bitterly cold winters living in improvised shelters and it seems they may have to face another monsoon season without proper homes.\nREAD MORE: The seasons have changed but Nepal has yet to recover \nEarly morning at the home of Sharma family in Dandagaon village, in Dhading district.
