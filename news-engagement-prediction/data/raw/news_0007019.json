Mark Kern, a video game designer turned conservative political pundit who has supported video surveillance of mosques, voiced his approval. He said that Trump's decisive action was a welcome change. \n\"If we sit and debate and prevaricate, remember Europe did this too, and now wishes it hadn't,\" he wrote in one tweet.

The Koch brothers condemned the order as the \"wrong approach\", and so did writers at their libertarian think-tank, the Cato Institute . John Podhoretz, the conservative commentator, reaffirmed that he thought Islamic terrorism posed a threat, but he wrote that the policy was not \"based in fact.\" SHARE David Koch, along with brother Charles, condemned the order as the \"wrong approach\".

Photo: Bloomberg \nA Quinnipiac poll taken in mid-January, before Trump issued the order, found that 48 per cent of Americans were in favour of \"suspending immigration from terror prone regions, even if it means turning away refugees.\" Trump's order immediately closed the nation to refugees and to people from some predominantly Muslim countries, including Iraq, Syria and Iran. \nIn the same poll, 53 per cent or respondents were in favour of requiring Muslim immigrants to register with the federal government. SHARE Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Jim Buterbaugh, a vocal opponent of refugees coming to his state, said the US was not there to \"take care of people\". Photo: AP \nA member of Trump's transition team, Kris Kobach, had suggested before the new president took office that a national registry for immigrants from countries plagued by terrorism might be reinstated. A spokesman for Trump at the time, Jason Miller, later clarified that the registry would not track individuals based on their religion. \nReuters reported that while protests filled airports where travellers were being held, many other people around the country were nonchalant about the order and puzzled by the protests. \nTrump supporters said they're satisfied with the immigration order and the ideas behind it, from improving national security to watching out for Americans first. Some Trump backers said they might do things a little differently than the president, but their overall reaction is positive. \n\"We're not the world's Social Security office. We're not here to take care of people,\" Jim Buterbaugh, the head of custodial work and maintenance at a public school in the western Montana town of White Hall, told AP. \"I understand that people need help, but there are other ways besides bringing them here.\" \nMike Honaker has some misgivings, too. A Trump supporter in a struggling West Virginia coal town, he didn't think \"blitzing everybody\" with an order that spread chaos around the world was the right way to go. \nBut Honaker worries about terrorism and does not have a problem with Trump's plan to screen refugees more thoroughly. Overall, Honaker likes 85 per cent of what the president has done so far. \n\"I think he's shaking it up, the whole of Washington, DC, and half the country, like he said he would,\" he said. \nLouise Ingram, 69, of Troy, Alabama, told Reuters that while she was not opposed to immigrants, \"I just want to make sure they are safe to come in.\" \n\"A country is not a country if it doesn't have borders,\" said Steve Hirsch, 63, who was at Dulles International Airport in Virginia, where hundreds of people were protesting, to pick someone up this weekend. \nOn Trump's official Facebook page, his supporters thanked him for the action. One user, Jason Juno Lee, who identifies himself as a Marine, posted a comment comparing the United States after the order to a safely locked house. \n\"I lock my doors every night,\" he wrote. \"I don't lock them because I 'hate' the people outside. I lock them because I love the people inside!\" \nAnother user named Wes Schmaltz was more concise: \"Thank you President Trump for doing exactly what you were elected to do.\" \nThe New York Times, AP Related Content", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T04:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:00:14.982+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
