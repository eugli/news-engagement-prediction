The jihadists held a knife to his throat in a number of the pictures, which appeared to actually be stills from a video. \nTwitter users shared tributes to Samaraei along with the Arabic-language hashtag \"The martyr Abu Bakr al-Samaraei.\" Some reflected on the fallen officer's bravery by noting the look on his face up until his execution.\n\n\"What is this pride? The pride of an Iraqi, a gallant of my homeland. To the gardens of eternity. His look summarizes the steadfastness of Iraq,\" wrote @Anas_Al3meri .\nFormer diplomat Lukman Faily, who served as the Iraqi ambassador to Japan and the U.S., also commended Samaraei for the bravery he appeared to show in his final moments.\n\"It is not the beheading that is going viral but his pride and defiance while he is being martyred,\" Faily tweeted.\nRelated Stories ISIS Trains Iraqi Orphans For Battle UN Concedes Transitional Goal To Assad \nISIS had its origin in the jihadist group known as Al Qaeda in Iraq which rose to power after the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq and overthrow of President Saddam Hussein. The group took advantage of unrest in Iraq and Syria and established rule over large swathes of territory in the nations in 2013 and 2014. The Iraqi government launched a massive ongoing offensive, supported by U.S. and Kurdish forces as well as Iran-backed Shiite militias, in October to recapture the ISIS-held city of Mosul, the group's last major bastion of influence in the country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:51:15.394+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
