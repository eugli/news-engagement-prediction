I was really happy for him. Hayley would’ve been happy for him to move on, but as David (Neilson, who plays Roy) has always said, he’s so particular is Roy, and that’s what made it interesting for us in Corrie, because they couldn’t do anything with us. \n‘They couldn’t do all the usual sort of things like giving us affairs and all that, they had to make us interesting just in our coupledom, just in our very conservative coupledom. Realistically Roy would never be with anybody else, so I think it’s very true to that, that he’s gone back to being this lone wolf, wandering around. \n‘But I was very happy, and Mel (Hill, who plays Cathy)’s absolutely lovely and she’s so brilliant as well, but I think it was probably the right thing for him and for that character.’ \nBroadchurch will kick off a final eight episode run next week with David Tennant and Olivia Colman reprising their main roles as investigators Hardy and Miller. Metro.co.uk have seen the opening episode and Julie’s performance as Trish is harrowing and deeply moving. \nThe series returns on Monday 27th February at 9pm on ITV.
