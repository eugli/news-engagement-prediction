It will make us a world leader in water quality standards for swimming, and that's important for New Zealand's growing tourism industry. It will return our rivers and lakes to a standard not seen in 50 years while recognising that our frequent major rainfalls mean a 100 per cent standard is not realistic.\" \nThe target covers the length of rivers over 0.4m deep and the perimeters of lakes greater than 1.5km, which total 54,000km. \n\"The plan is about improving the frequency that we can swim in our lakes and rivers, noting that even our cleanest rivers breach swimming water quality standards during storms.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T08:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:44:11.843+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
