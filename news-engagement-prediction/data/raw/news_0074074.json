Xavier (18-10, 8-7) has lost four in a row. \nFirst- and second-round games of the NCAA tournament will be March 17 and 19 at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. Butler is eligible to be assigned because it is not one of the hosts (those are the Horizon League and IUPUI) and did not play as many as three games there. The tournament selection committee places high seeds (Nos. 1-4) closest to geographic location. \nThe issue is that as many as five nearby schools — Louisville, Kentucky, Butler, Purdue, Notre Dame — are in the mix for top-four seeds. Under the pod system, teams from two different regions may be assigned to Indianapolis. \nAs David Worlock, the NCAA's director of media coordination and statistics, explained in an email: \n“If Kentucky ended up a 1 seed, obviously the 16, 8 and 9 seeds from their region would join UK here. If Louisville was a 2, then the 15, 7 and 10 seeds from their region would be here, and that leaves no other spots in Indy for anyone else.” \n• Looking at 20 years of Butler's best road wins \nIn the latest mock bracket by USA TODAY'S Shelby Mast, Louisville is a No. 2 seed and Butler a No. 3, both assigned to Indianapolis out of the Midwest and South regions, respectively. His bracket places Kentucky (No. 4), Purdue (No. 4) and Notre Dame (No. 5) all in Milwaukee for the first two rounds. \nESPN bracketologist Joe Lunardi also has Butler as a No. 3 seed, but assigned to Milwaukee. Louisville (No. 2) and Kentucky (No. 3) are in Indianapolis in his mock bracket. \nThe NCAA released the committee’s tentative top four seeds two weeks ago. Those included Louisville at No. 2, Kentucky at No. 3 and Butler at No. 4 . \nMuch can change as the regular season ends and conference tournaments begin. The Bulldogs have at least given themselves a chance to open the NCAA tournament in their home city. Their highest seed ever is No. 5 from both 2007 and 2010. \n“What you’re really trying to do is set yourself up to play meaningful games at this time of year,” coach Chris Holtmann said. “That’s what makes being a college basketball player fun.” Buy Photo \nChris Holtmann has the Bulldogs on the verge of a top-four seed, which would be the program's highest-ever.

They had to win their final three regular-season games to slip in as a No. 9 seed. \n“I can tell you I’d rather be in this position right now than (what) we were in last year,” point guard Tyler Lewis said. “It was different last year. Now, we’re going to get in the tournament.” \nThe Bulldogs could be dissuaded from looking ahead because of the urgency confronting them in Ohio. They have lost five in a row at Xavier, and the last four have not been close: 62-47, 79-68, 73-56, 88-69. Xavier is 12-2 at home this season. \nButler last won at Xavier 74-65 on Dec. 23, 2008, when Gordon Hayward was a freshman. \nButler beat Xavier 83-78 in Indianapolis on Jan. 14 . Edmond Sumner, now sidelined by a season-ending knee injury, scored all of his 22 points in the second half for Xavier. Kamar Baldwin scored all of his 21 in the second half for Butler. \n“We’re definitely looking to exceed expectations,” Lewis said. “And hopefully, we can win these next two games and make a good run in the Big East tournament and NCAA tournament.” \nCall IndyStar reporter David Woods at (317) 444-6195.

NO. 22 BUTLER at XAVIER \nTipoff: 3:30 p.m. Sunday, Cintas Center, Cincinnati. \nTV: Fox Sports 1. \nRadio: WFNI-AM (1070), -FM (93.5). \nStorylines: \n>> Chris Holtmann said he does not expect to change what has become Butler’s starting lineup in a 4-1 February: Andrew Chrabascz, Tyler Wideman, Avery Woodson, Kethan Savage and Kamar Baldwin. Off the bench, Kelan Martin has averaged 18.3 points and 8.3 rebounds over three games. In three games before that, he averaged 6.7 and 4.7, respectively. “I’m kind of used to that role, bringing more energy to our team off the bench,” said Martin, who came off the bench for his first 1½ college seasons. \n>> Park Tudor’s Trevon Bluiett scored 14 points for Xavier in Wednesday’s 71-64 loss at Seton Hall. He had missed the previous two games because of an ankle injury. He is fourth in the Big East in scoring (17.8 ppg). \n>> Butler is 17-0 when allowing 70 or fewer points and also 17-0 when shooting a higher percentage than its opponent. \n— David Woods", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T22:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:59:08.307+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
