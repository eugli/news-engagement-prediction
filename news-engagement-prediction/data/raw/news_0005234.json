Back in September 2016, 13-year-old Danielle Peskowitz Bregoli and her mother appeared on Dr. Phil to discuss the teen’s “out-of-control” behavior . If you’re a regular viewer of The Dr. Phil Show , the two women’s segment was nothing out of the ordinary. One teen with attitude and a mouth to match + one anxious mother = some solid television (it always does). “ I Want To Give Up My Car-Stealing, Knife-Wielding, Twerking 13-Year-Old Daughter Who Tried To Frame Me For A Crime ,” proclaims the The Dr. Phil Show website entry about them. Are you hooked? I am.\nThe segment likely would have faded into daytime-television obscurity had it not been for one perfect moment. “All these hos laughin’ like there’s something funny,” Bregoli says, gesturing to the audience. “Did you say,” Dr. Phil responds, judiciously pausing and moving his hands as though attempting to sort through Bregoli’s meaning, “the hos are laughing?” The audience begins to applaud. At which point Bregoli unleashes the line that would soon make her an internet star: “ Cash me outside, howbow dah? ”\nAs her mother explains, noting her daughter’s accent was acquired on “the streets,” “cash me outside” “means she’ll go outside and do what she has to do.” How ’bout that.\nSince then, the clip and phrase have taken on a second life as a meme. Which seems perfectly reasonable, since “cash me outside, howbow dah” is the perfect retort for just about any situation. The phrase has been applied to everything from tweets to image macros and even inspired Bitmoji to roll out a pictograph inspired by the meme.\nThis is literally my favorite video ever\npic.twitter.com/O7MQ4hlBjV\n— connor (@cxnnnor) December 14, 2016 Obama: Joe, what did i say about being respectful to Donald\nBiden: If he has a problem with me he can cash me outside howbow dah pic.twitter.com/Y6itt1HZqh\n— Savage Biden (@SavageBiden) January 25, 2017 *Filling out a job application*\n“ How do you handle a difficult situation with a rude customer?\" pic.twitter.com/8tqLgg9CUc\n— Ana Guerrero (@_analiciousss) January 10, 2017 Lmao they really got a Bitmoji for this. #CashMeOutside pic.twitter.com/4BnHhZ1wyL\n— Mia (@Mamma__Mia) January 24, 2017 Artist @LushSux — the same person who turned a Taylor Swift “memorial” into a Harambe/SpongeBob mural — painted Danielle’s meme-spirational likeness on a wall. “Cash me outside on a wahl, how bow dah?” And a church in Georgia decided to transform their marquee in homage to the meme in the hopes of attracting millennials. “Cash God inside, howbow dah?”\nCass me ousside on a wahl, how bow dah? #howbowdah #catchmeoutsidehowboutdat #howboutdat\nA photo posted by lushsux (@lushsux) on Jan 27, 2017 at 4:27am PST\nchurch signs are getting out of hand 😂 \"cash God inside, howbow dah?\" pic.twitter.com/Bku138XFCu\n— ㅤㅤㅤ (@whataboutdj) January 26, 2017 The other night at my local gym, by the water fountain, I witnessed a woman attempting to explain “cash me outside” to another woman. (Yes, yes, this is in complete violation of meme rule number one: Never attempt to explain a meme IRL.) She attempted several sentences about a “hilarious teen,” but ultimately the best she could come up with was “just Google ‘Dr. Phil Cash Me Outside,’ it’s so funny.” Which , actually, wasn’t terrible advice. Google searches for the meme — in variant spellings — have seen a spike in recent weeks . And really, how does one explain the beauty that is “cash me outside.”\nOf course, the sudden popularity of the meme has also thrust the teen who started it all back into the spotlight. Earlier this week, a story claimed that Peskowitz Bregoli had committed suicide after she was bullied by classmates for her appearance on the show. The story was later debunked by Snopes , which notes it ran on fake news site “NBC-News.net” which, unsurprisingly, isn’t related to the real NBC. Peskowitz Bregoli is alive and well and keeping her fans updated via Facebook, where just yesterday she streamed a live video consisting largely of her counting dollar bills to the camera for nearly an hour. It has since been viewed over 45,000 times. “CASH ME LIVE!” Well … how bow dah.\nTags: twitter memes howbow dah Top Stories Snapchat’s IPO Shows How Expensive It Is to Compete in Silicon Valley Uber CEO Travis Kalanick Resigns From Trump Advisory Board Why It Doesn’t Matter That Facebook Lost a $500 Million Lawsuit Most Viewed Stories A Brief History of ‘Cash Me Outside, Howbow Dah?’ Philadelphia Teacher Starts Crowdfunding Campaign to ‘Buy’ Pat Toomey’s Vote Use This Generator to Make Trump Sign Any Executive Order You Want The Alt-Right No Longer Has a Home on Reddit Club Penguin Users Finally Tip the Iceberg, Solving Decadelong Mystery Most Popular Video On Select All This Kinetic Sculpture Mimics the Movements of a Flock of Birds Latest News from Select All 6:44 p.m. Snapchat’s IPO Shows How Expensive It Is to Compete in Silicon Valley Silicon Valley is supposed to be the land of disruptors.
