The mother disappeared into the woods after securing her babies and did not disturb or harm anyone. \n“After hours of waiting, the mother leopard came looking for them and took them away. The photos show how much she missed them,” Ajay Deshmukh, Senior Veterinarian at the Manikdoh Leopard Rescue Centre, told IANS. \n“We learn from this documentation that rescuers must not give up by relocating or shifting the cubs in zoo.
