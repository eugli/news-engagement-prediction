In the largest ever scientifically designed drug survey undertaken in the world for determining the quality of drugs, ministry officials said 0.0245% of the 47,012 samples were spurious. The ministry had entrusted the work relating to carrying out a survey of the extent of problems of \"spurious and not of standard quality drugs'' to the National Institute of Biologicals (NIB), Noida. The NIB has since submitted the report to the government. The survey included as many as 224 drug molecules belonging to 15 different therapeutic categories of the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) 2011. \"As a part of this survey, 47,954 drug samples relating to 23 dosage forms were drawn from 654 districts of 36 states and union territories from the supply chains including retail outlets, government sources and from eight airports and sea ports,'' said a press release on Wednesday. All the samples were subjected to test / analysis as per pharmacopoeial requirements in the central and state drug testing laboratories that have been accredited by NABL. \"Overall, out of the 47,012 samples tested, 13 samples were found to be spurious and 1,850 samples were found to be 'not of standard quality' (NSQ),'' said the release. As such, the percentage of NSQ drugs in India has been found to be 3.16% and that of spurious drugs 0.0245%.
