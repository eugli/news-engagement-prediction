Suzanne Runciman described as a \"resin-like syrup.\"\nRunciman told CBC News that the dual wheel on the exact opposite side of the tractor-trailer was also loose, but that wheel did not fall off.\n@OPP_ER Here's a closer look at the wheels which were loose and close to separating. pic.twitter.com/Gba4mUHWT3\n— @OPP_ER The driver of the tractor-trailer, a man in his early 40s from Port Colborne, Ont., has been charged under the Highway Traffic Act with driving a commercial motor vehicle with a major defect, and driving a commercial motor vehicle with a detached wheel.\nThe company that owns the tractor-trailer, Element Bulk Logistics from Hannon, Ont., is facing similar charges.\n@OPP_ER Additional wheels were close to falling off as well. The wheels which did come off struck two transports and three cars. pic.twitter.com/7DlBWWNCPO\n— @OPP_ER Here's a closer look at the two wheels that made up the dual wheel that fell off.
