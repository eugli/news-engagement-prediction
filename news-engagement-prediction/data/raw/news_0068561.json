Picture: Facebook Source: Supplied \nInstead of ignoring her request, Ohio officer Lieutenant B.J. Gruber did his best to lend a hand.\nLena informed the policeman that she was stuck on the problem (8+29)x15.\nHe quickly responded with the tip: “Do the numbers in the parenthesis first so in essence it would be 37×15.”\nAfter nailing the advice for the first question, Lieutenant Gruber was given a more difficult task.\nLena asked him for the solution of (90+27)+(29+15)x2.\nThe officers hastily came to Lena’s rescue when she told them she was struggling with the work. Picture: Facebook Source: Supplied \nThe confident officer responded with what he believed to be the correct answer, advising: “Take the answer from the first parenthesis plus the answer from the second parenthesis and multiply that answer times two.\n“Work left to right doing the work inside the parenthesis first.”\nBut Facebook users were quick to notice that his maths solution didn’t quite add up.\nThey argued that to solve the problem, you add the numbers in the second parentheses and multiply them by two, before adding the digits in the first set of brackets.\nLieutenant Gruber (centre) was quick to respond to the baffled primary school student.

Source: Supplied \nLena’s mum Molly posted a snap of the adorable exchange on to Facebook after her daughter revealed that the kind officer had been helping her out.\nShe told ABC news : “I didn’t believe her and asked for a screen shot. I thought it was pretty funny. And I love that they went ahead with it.\n“I was happy, but not surprised that they responded so quickly. They are wonderful with their communication with the community.”\nSadly the second solution to Lena’s maths problem didn’t quite add up. Picture: Facebook Source: Supplied \nAfter Lieutenant Gruber was told about the mistake, he joked: “Hoping it is truly the thought that counts since apparently I cannot!\n“Especially since the answer was wrong, it was very nice for Molly to acknowledge our attempt to help her daughter with some math homework.”\nThis article originally appeared on The Sun.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:16:31.977+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
