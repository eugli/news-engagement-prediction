A drop on the skin can kill in minutes. \nUnravelling the mystery of Kim Jong-nam's death \nMr Kim died two weeks ago after two women accosted him briefly in a check-in hall at Kuala Lumpur International Airport's low-cost carrier terminal, known as KLIA2. \nHealth Minister S Subramaniam said the discovery that the VX toxin was used confirmed the hospital's autopsy result, which suggested that a \"chemical agent caused very serious paralysis\", leading to death \"in a very short period of time\". \nThe airport has been swept for toxic chemicals by various specialised police teams, forensic experts, the fire department's hazardous materials unit and the Atomic Energy Licensing Board. \n\"As a result of this screening process done we confirm: number one, there is no hazardous material found in KLIA2. Number two, KLIA2 is free from any form of contamination of hazardous material. And thirdly, is KLIA2 is declared a safe zone,\" said Abdul Samah Mat, the police official heading the investigation. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Tens of thousands of passengers have passed through the airport since the murder took place \nThere is widespread suspicion that North Korea was behind the attack, which it strongly denies. \nA Vietnamese woman and a North Korean man have also been arrested in connection with the killing. \nThe Vietnamese foreign ministry confirmed that the Vietnamese national being held was Doan Thi Huong, born in 1988, saying she had told officials she thought she was taking part in a television prank. \nAt least seven other suspects are wanted for questioning by police, including Hyon Kwang Song, 44, second secretary at the North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur. Media caption CCTV footage appears to show the moment Kim Jong-nam is attacked \nAfter a 30-minute meeting with Siti Aisyah on Saturday, Indonesian Deputy Ambassador Andreano Erwin said: \"She only said in general that somebody asked her to do this activity. She only said in general she met with some people who looked Japanese or Korean. \n\"According to her, that person gave her 400 ringgits to do this activity... She only said she was given a kind of oil, like baby oil.\" Image copyright EPA Image caption Siti Aisyah \"met some people who looked Japanese or Korean\", Indonesian officials said \nThe officials said they did not see any physical signs that the suspect had been affected by the chemical. \nMalaysian police say the attackers had been trained to immediately wash their hands after the attack. \nSome experts have suggested that they might have each smeared two different non-lethal elements of VX, which became deadly when mixed on Mr Kim's face. What is the deadly VX nerve agent? Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Molecular model of VX nerve agent shows atoms represented as spheres The most potent of the known chemical warfare agents, it is a clear, amber-coloured, oily liquid which is tasteless and odourless Works by penetrating the skin and disrupting the transmission of nerve impulses - a drop on the skin can kill in minutes. Lower doses can cause eye pain, blurred vision, drowsiness and vomiting It can be disseminated in a spray or vapour when used as a chemical weapon, or used to contaminate water, food, and agricultural products VX can be absorbed into the body by inhalation, ingestion, skin contact, or eye contact Clothing can carry VX for about 30 minutes after contact with the vapour, which can expose other people Banned by the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention Media caption Rupert Wingfield-Hayes: Three reasons why the use of VX is so extraordinary Who was Kim Jong-nam? \nThe well-travelled and multilingual oldest son of late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, he was once considered a potential future leader. He has lived abroad for years and was bypassed in favour of his half-brother, Kim Jong-un. \nHe had been travelling on a passport under the name Kim Chol. North Korea has yet to confirm that the deceased was actually Kim Jong-nam. Image copyright AP Image caption North Korea has not identified the man who died as Kim Jong-nam, only as a North Korean citizen \nFor many years, it was believed Kim Jong-nam was being groomed to succeed his father as the next leader. \nBut that appears to have come to an end in 2001 when Kim was caught sneaking into Japan on a fake passport. \nHe later became one of the regime's most high-profile critics, openly questioning the authoritarian policies and dynastic succession his grandfather Kim Il-sung began crafting in 1948.
