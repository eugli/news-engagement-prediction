Leading Republicans in the US have called for an investigation into leaks that led to the resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn.\nThe heads of the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees are concerned potentially classified information was released.\nMr Flynn is alleged to have discussed US sanctions with Russia's ambassador in calls before his own appointment.\nIt is illegal for private citizens to conduct US diplomacy.\nPresident Donald Trump, who is also facing questions over his ties with Russia, accused US intelligence agencies of leaking information about Mr Flynn's phone calls.\n\"The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by \"intelligence\" like candy. Very un-American!\" he said in a series of tweets following Mr Flynn's departure.\nMr Flynn, a retired army lieutenant-general, initially denied having discussed sanctions with Ambassador Sergei Kislyak, and Vice-President Mike Pence publicly denied the allegations on his behalf.\nBut he came under mounting pressure on Monday when details of his phone calls emerged in US media, as well as reports the justice department had warned the White House about him misleading senior officials and being vulnerable to Russian blackmail.\nMore on the Flynn scandal Russia looms large behind Flynn affair Five big questions after Flynn's resignation Russia: The scandal Trump can't shake How Flynn's resignation unfolded In a letter to the Department of Justice inspector general , chairmen of the House committees on oversight and the judiciary said information about the monitoring of Mr Flynn's communications by intelligence agencies was likely to have been top secret.\n\"We have serious concerns about the potential inadequate protection of classified information here,\" Reps Jason Chaffetz and Bob Goodlatte wrote.\nThey said the release of classified information could have \"grave effects on national security\".\nJason Chaffetz and his co-signer say they are worried about potentially classified information being published Their letter comes after other members of their party, including the Senate's second-ranking Republican, John Cornyn, called instead for an investigation into Mr Flynn's ties with Russia.\nBut US House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes told reporters on Tuesday he wanted to focus on the leaks, and said the FBI should explain why Mr Flynn's conversation had been recorded.\nBoth the Senate and House intelligence committees - along with the FBI - are already examining Russian hacking and involvement in the US election.\nMr Flynn (centre left) was pictured dining with Russian leader Vladimir Putin (centre right) in December 2015 It is unclear how the allegations against Mr Flynn would be handled by the different investigators.\nHis conversations with the Russian ambassador took place about the time that then-President Barack Obama was imposing sanctions on Russia following reports it attempted to sway the US election in Mr Trump's favour.\nAs relations between the new US president and the country's intelligence agencies continue to sour, the New York Times reported on Wednesday that Mr Trump was planning to appoint his friend Stephen Feinberg, the billionaire co-founder of Cerberus Capital Management, to lead a review of into their practices. The BBC has not been able to verify these claims.\nMeanwhile, the Kremlin has said that political turbulence in the United States is delaying the resumption of better relations between Washington and Moscow.\n\"We hope that sooner or later the process will start to resume a normal business relationship with Washington,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday.\n\"We're losing time in terms of solving global problems.\"\nHe said possible plans for an investigation into Mr Flynn was an \"internal affair\" for the US.\nRussia has dismissed concern about the former national security adviser's communications, saying \"it's nothing to do with us\".", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/78CA/production/_94622903_mediaitem94622902.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1372F/production/_94636697_464x2.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/12A31/production/_94673367_037898702-1.jpg", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/us/politics/trump-intelligence-agencies-stephen-feinberg.html", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/831853862281699331", "https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2017-02-15-JEC-RWG-to-Horowitz-re-Classified-Info.pdf"], "published": "2017-02-16T16:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T16:08:38.813+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
