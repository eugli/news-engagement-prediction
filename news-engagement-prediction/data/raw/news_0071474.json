It was available on the world’s first roaming international mobile phone network called the Nordic Mobile Telephone service set up by Mobria.

Photograph: Lehtikuva OY/REX\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \nNokia 9000 Communicator, 1996 \nThe world’s first smartphone, with flip-open screen and full keypad. It was huge by late 90s phone standards but was a sign of things to come. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \nNokia 6110, 1997 \nThe first of the business-focused 6000 series, the Nokia 6110 was the first GSM phone to use an ARM processor and the first to use the Nokia icon-based menu. Photograph: versus167/Flickr\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \nNokia 5110, 1998 \nThe consumer version of the 6110, the 5110 was rugged, lasted ages between charges and had a replaceable faceplate. Oh, and it was one of the first handsets to come with a little game known as Snake. Photograph: Martin Pettitt/Flickr\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \nNokia 7110, 1999 \nThe 7110 was notable for a couple of reasons: it was the first Series 40 phone, had a WAP browser and a navi-roller bar thing, and it was the first mobile phone with T9 predictive text input. Before the 7110, SMS messages had to be bashed out using multi-tap only. It wasn’t the Matrix phone – that was the 8110 – but it looked like it and the spring-loaded slider seemed exciting.

Photograph: whatleydude/Flickr\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \nNokia 3210, 1999 \nOne of the most popular phones in history, selling more than 160m units since release, and the first mass-market phone with an internal antenna. But the 3210 will probably best be remembered for popularising Snake and its T9 predictive text. Photograph: MiNe/Flickr\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \nNokia 3310, 2000 \nThe followup to the popular 3210, the 3310 introduced a vibrating alert to the masses, which meant you didn’t have to listen to everyone’s chintzy tones. And it had Snake 2.

Photograph: ejdj968/Flickr\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \nNokia 6800, 2002 \nTexting was big by the late 90s and early 2000s, but how do you combine a traditional phone form factor with a full thumb board? Make the keyboard fold out on a central hinge, putting the screen in the middle of two sides of a thumb board, of course. Photograph: The Sydney Morning Herald/Fairfax Media via Getty Images\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \nNokia 7600, 2003 \nThe Finnish firm certainly wasn’t afraid to try the odd unusual design. One of the weirdest was the diamond-shaped 7600, which was big, chunky and difficult to text on. Photograph: Kansir/Flickr\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \nNokia N-Gage, 2003 \nPart portable games console, part very awkward phone, the N-Gage was Nokia’s attempt at luring people away from Nintendo’s Game Boy Advance. Little did they know that mobile phone gaming would go big, just not like this. Photograph: Getty Images\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \nNokia 7280, 2004 \nAnother attempt at an interesting form factor, the 7280 was known as the ‘lipstick phone’ because it was about the size of a large stick and the end slid out. It didn’t even have a keypad, relying on a rotary selector pad. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \nNokia N90, 2005 \nThe first of the new ‘Nseries’ phones, the N90 was the top of the range with a flip-and-swivel screen and 2-megapixel camera, which meant it could be used like a traditional video camera. It could even print directly to some printers via USB or Bluetooth. Photograph: John B. Carnett/Popular Science via Getty Images\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \nNokia N95, 2007 \nThe Nokia N95 took camera phones to the next level with a 5-megapixel Carl Zeiss camera on the back that rivalled most compact cameras of the day. It was a two-way slider with media keys on one side and a traditional phone keypad on the other, but no touchscreen. It was an excellent phone, but launched the same year as Apple’s iPhone, it suddenly looked very dated. Photograph: Unspecified/Publicity image from PR company\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \nNokia Lumia 800, 2011 \nThe first of Nokia’s Windows Phones, the Lumia 800 took the basic design of the MeeGo-based N9 and installed Windows Phone 7.5 on it. It had a 3.7in screen and 8-megapixel camera. Photograph: Paul Hackett/Reuters\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \nNokia 808 PureView, 2012 \nA camera with a phone attached, the Nokia 808 PureView had a 41-megapixel sensor, Carl Zeiss optics and was one of the last phones to run Symbian. It remains the highest resolution camera phone to this day. Photograph: Yosomono/Flickr\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \nNokia Lumia 1020, 2013 \nThe Lumia 1020 took the PureView camera technology from the 808 PureView and put it in a Windows Phone. It had a much smaller camera bump on the back and bold styling. Photograph: Timothy Clary/AFP/Getty Images\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \nNew Nokia 3310, 2017 \nA update to 2000’s original produced by the Nokia-brand owner HMD Global, the new 3310 has a colour screen, a camera on the back, a month of standby time and nostalgia setting turned up to the max.
