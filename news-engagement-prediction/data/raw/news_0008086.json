NBA Australia \nPublished on Jan. 29, 2017 \nJan. 29, 2017 \nLeBron James and Kyrie Irving powered the Cleveland Cavaliers to a much-needed 107-91 win over the OKlahoma City Thunder. \nMORE: NBA players potentially affected by Trump's new immigration order \nIrving was at his dazzling best, finishing with 29 points and 10 assists, while James added 25 points, 14 rebounds and eight assists. \nRussell Westbrook and Irving went back and forth all game, with the OKC point guard tallying 20 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists for his 24th triple-double of the season, but it wasn't enough. \nOKC kept things close through the first two quarters, but struggled when Westbrook went to the bench. They rallied late in the second quarter to tie things up just before the half at 43-43, but the Cavs then went on a 15-2 run to take a commanding 58-45 lead at the main break. \nBoth teams traded blows in the third quarter, but the Cavs had too much offensive firepower, eventually stretching their lead to 19 points. \nKyrie Irving was feelin' some type of way, showing off every dribble move in the book as he attacked the Thunder guards off the dribble with an array of playground moves.

Westbrook himself shot just 7-for 26 on the night, while Victor Oladpo's 17 points came on 6-for-18. \nAfter dropping six of their past eight, the Cavs have now won back-to-back games, easing the pressure that was bulding around the organisation. \nThey look to continue their run as they travel to Dallas ot take on the Mavs on Wednesday AEDT, while the Thunder prepare to take on the Spurs on Thursday.
