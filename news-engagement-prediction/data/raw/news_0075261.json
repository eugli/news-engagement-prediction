And that led to some conservatives suspecting Trump of acting on behalf of the Democrats, and in particular the Clintons, to sabotage the GOP. \nThe Saturday Night Live comedian Seth Myers once quipped: “Donald Trump often talks about running as a Republican, which is surprising. I just assumed he was running as a joke.” \nRelated Story: Read Some of Donald Trump's Most Outrageous Comments \nThough many conservatives suspected Trump wasn't a real conservative for a long time before the 2016 campaign, he insisted he had the credentials to win over the Republican Party's right wing. \n“I am a conservative person. I am by nature a conservative person. I never looked at putting a label on myself, I wasn’t in politics,\" Trump said in 2015. \"But if you look at my general attitudes in life I would certainly have the more conservative label put on me.\" When Donald Trump Was a Democrat \nIt turns out you don't have to look far to find evidence that Trump wasn't always a conservative Republican. \nTrump was registered as a Democrat for more than eight years in the 2000s, according to New York City voter records made public during his campaign for president in 2016. \nTrump owned up to his years with the other party and told CNN he identified with Democrats during that time because they were more adept at handling the economy. \nSaid Trump: \n\"It just seems that the economy does better under the Democrats than the Republicans. Now, it shouldn't be that way. But if you go back, I mean it just seems that the economy does better under the Democrats. ... But certainly we had some very good economies under Democrats, as well as Republicans. But we've had some pretty bad disasters under the Republicans.\" \nTrump was a regiserted Democrat from August 2001 through September 2009. Why Trump's Voting Record Matters in 2016 \nTrump's inconsistency when it comes to party affiliation - he's also been registered with the Independence Party and as an independent - was an issue in the campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. Many in the large field of presidential hopefuls criticized his affiliation with the Democrats, including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. \n“He was a Democrat longer than he was a Republican. He's given more money to Democrats than he has to Republicans,\" Bush said. (Among the politicians Trump has given money to is former Secretary of State and U.S. Sen. Hillary Clinton.) \nIt probably didn't help Trump's case among conservative voters that he's spoken very highly of some of Democrats who are typically vilified by conservatives including Harry Reid, Oprah Winfrey , Hillary Clinton and even Nancy Pelosi . Trump as a Stalking Horse \nRelated Story: Could the President and Vice President Be From Opposing Political Parties? \n\"Donald Trump is trolling the GOP,\" political reporter Jonathan Allen wrote. \nTrump also threatened to run for president as an independent, a move many believed would siphon votes from the Republican nominee as other, similar candidates have done in the past .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:06:39.173+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
