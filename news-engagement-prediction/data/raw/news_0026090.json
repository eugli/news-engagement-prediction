More Whilst Chelsea dropping points away to Burnley will be the main talking point of the clash, the moment that a man leapt to the defence of a young fan, who was inches away from being struck by a ball, deserves some attention. The incident occurred when a wayward Ashley Barnes shot flew into the stands as the home side trailed 1-0 at the hands of the league leaders. barnes shot More As the shot hurtled towards the face of the youngster a fellow Burnley fan, being hailed as a 'hero' by many on social media, got his hands up in time to save the kid from being struck with a save that would've made Tom Heaton proud. In a game of 19 shots, this wasn't the only save of the match. But the freezing cold weather conditions and lack of first team action for the fan this season make this save all the more impressive.

A safety net wasn't needed on this occasion, thanks to the flying Burnley fan, but this is what can happen when neither of the two are present... Chelsea initially took the lead after just seven minutes when Pedro slotted the ball away following a swift counter-attack by the away side.

The result means that the Clarets end the game week in 12th, ten points away from the relegation zone, whilst Antonio Conte's side could have their lead shortened to just eight points if Manchester City pick up all three points against Bournemouth on Monday.
