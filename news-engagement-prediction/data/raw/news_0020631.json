This time it's a freebie. \nUsually you have to wait till the end of the season to pick up a good value free transfer, usually when an older player is seen as surplus to requirements at his current club. \nCheck out our list of some of the best free transfers: \nIn January Burnley re-signed Joey Barton after the trouble causing but talented midfielder was released from his Rangers contract a few months earlier and Sam Allardyce brought Chris Samba into train with Crystal Palace with a view to sign the defender. \nAnd now Southampton are joining in on the bargain bin deals. The Saints look certain to bring former Juventus centre back Martin Caceres in on a free. Like with all free transfers he's likely to be on a big deal with the Mirror reporting a £100k-a-week deal for the defender. \nThe Uruguayan last played a competitive game for the Old Lady in February and has been out of contract since June. He was also linked with a move to AC Milan and Sunderland but the Saints are more likely to offer him first team football. \nIn the transfer window they sold wantaway defender Jose Fonte to West Ham for £8 million and then lost Virgil van Dijk to a medium term injury but couldn't sign any cover. \nCaceres is likely to get first team football at St Mary's so it's no surprise that he's picked the Premier League team. He is likely to go straight into the team and be selected for the EFL Cup final against Manchester United at the end of this month. \nThere will be fitness concerns surrounding the 29 year old after he ruptured his achilles tendon last season. \nWill he be a good signing for Southampton?
