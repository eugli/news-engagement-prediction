My New Year resolution is to go and see Comic Relief and see if I can interest them in a Golden Day.” Minister's social care ideas ignore the million childless over-65s | Kirsty Woodard Read more \nThe Childline founder added that following on from the public inquiry into institutional child abuse , she would also like to see an inquiry focusing on elder abuse. \n“There are important stories that need to be heard,” said Rantzen. “The inquiry’s aim should be to ensure people abused are heard and to learn lessons. If older people were prepared to disclose what was happening in their lives, I’m absolutely certain it would uncover things, we need to know.” \nShe said she believed there were a “huge number of cases” of older people being ignored and neglected. Rantzen called on Theresa May to “make it completely unacceptable to ignore, despise or resent old people”. \nThe broadcaster said attitudes towards older people had changed during her lifetime. She remembered going shopping with her grandmother as a child as a social experience. \n“Every shop she went into they’d ask her about her family – they would have a conversation,” said Rantzen. “But now, if you pause at a supermarket checkout, staff say something and you get grumbles from people in the queue behind.” \nHer grandmother chatted to her daughters daily and Rantzen saw her weekly. “We didn’t think of that as caring for her. We just knew she was part of our lives. Absolutely central. \n“People as they get older remain human beings. We need to praise them, regard them as precious, recognise their value to us and as they get more frail, we need to recognise our debt to them.” \nBut recalling a Silver Line caller who spent Christmas Day alone and hadn’t spoken to anybody for a week, she said: “When I rang her, she was in her nightclothes, during the day she doesn’t get dressed. She has no reason to.” Angeline Albert is news editor of homecare.co.uk \nJoin the Social Care Network to read more pieces on issues like this.
