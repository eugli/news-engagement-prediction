(Facebook: Rupertswood Farm) \nIt took Mr Clark two days to shape the crop on a wide mower modified with a GPS guidance system and a bulker bag for sun protection. \nHe said he included the small islands around the state in the maze, but admitted they were only a rough representation. \n\"King Island is a big part of our children's mini-maze,\" he said. \n\"I think there is a little bit of a bump around where Bruny [Island] is because some of the finer detail is hard with the mower because it's 6-feet wide. \n\"A couple of the lakes are also a bit tricky, but hopefully I've mastered them.\" \nThe Clarks, who farm sheep and vegetables, diversified into agritourism about four years ago and threw open the gates of their property to the public and enabling them to interact with farm life. \nThe maze, designed by UK maze specialists Mazescape, is one of their more popular activities and will be open for most of March. \nIt will then be mowed for silage. \n\"This variety, I've been told, is more a forage variety and if it didn't get the units, it may not form a cob,\" Mr Clark said. \n\"[That] has not concerned me at all because the logistics of having cobs and kids running around together ... it could lead to some awkwardness.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T10:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T05:48:31.204+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
