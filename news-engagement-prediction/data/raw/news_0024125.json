Most of these are loans given during 2007-08-09 period when the boom period of the economy was there,” he said. \n“Your allegation is that your sins have not been corrected and reversed by us. This cannot be a charge on us,” said the finance minister. \nJaitley said disproportionate loans were given by the UPA to certain industries and that they were not farmers. \nDocuments which have come out say that loans were given through intervention of the North Block and the concerned bank officials were having to pay for it now, he said, in an apparent reference to cases being filed against some bank officials in connection with Mallya case. \n“These were not to small people. It was to big companies. It was your legacy, it was your contribution. Our misfortune is that every year the interest goes up and so it becomes 5.1% from 4.1% and then becomes 6.1,” he said, adding the NDA was paying “interest” on UPA’s work. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T04:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:53:37.711+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
