Try to reduce your intake of fatty cuts of beef, lamb, and pork and poultry skin, and dairy products such as lard, cream, butter, and cheese. \nUnsaturated fats \nReplacing saturated fats with unsaturated “good” fats can help boost heart health. Add in monounsaturated fats, for example olive oil, rapeseed oil, almonds, unsalted cashews and avocado, or polyunsaturated fats, such as sunflower oil and vegetable oil, walnuts, sunflower seeds and oily fish. \nHowever remember that all fats and oils — including the healthier ones — are high in calories, so even unsaturated fats should only be used in small amounts. \nFibre and protein \n“Fibre is important for gastrointestinal motility, blood sugar control and lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol,” Rivers said. “Fibre is great for appetite control because it can fill you up and keep you feeling fuller for longer.” \nWhole, fresh fruit and vegetables are good sources of fiber, as are whole grains such as brown rice, wild rice, whole oats, and wholegrain barley, and legumes, beans and peas. \nProtein is also needed as part of a balanced diet to build and maintain muscles and can be found in a variety of sources such as lean meats cooked using a low-fat method, such as baking. \nSalt \nEating too much salt can increase the risk of developing high blood pressure, which in turn can increase the risk of developing coronary heart disease. \nTry seasoning your food with herbs and spices for extra flavour to reduce your salt intake. \nAlcohol \nStick to the recommended guidelines and remember, everything in moderation. \nTreat yourself too \nAlthough the AHA, CDC, and BHF all encourage a heart-healthy diet, Rivers says a “cheat day” is OK occasionally and a little bit of what you like rather than depriving yourself entirely will help you stick to a nutritious eating plan. \nYour favourite piece of chocolate or guacamole and tortilla chips are what Rivers recommends as two heart-healthy treats to have on “cheat days,” adding that, “The occasional bite of dark chocolate or a nice glass of pinot noir is a perfect reward for your efforts to sustain your heart health.” Read more ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:34:48.909+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
