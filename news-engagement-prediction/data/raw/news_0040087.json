He’ll also soon finish his sixth book, “Reinventing Good.” Advertisement \n“I’ll be 62 this year,” Weber says. “I’d like to be a little freer, but I’m still going to be [working on] growth strategies, new business, and thought leadership.” \nProdromou has worked with Weber for two decades, dating back to the days when Weber was turning The Weber Group , his former tech-focused PR firm, into the PR giant known as Weber Shandwick under Interpublic Group’s ownership.

Weber became its CEO, and built Racepoint into the biggest PR agency in Boston, based on the Boston Business Journal’s rankings, with clients that include AT&T, IBM , and Huawei . (His old firm, Weber Shandwick, is No. 2 on that list.) \nWeber started to put his succession plan in place in 2013, by making Prodromou the president of Racepoint as Weber merged the business with its sister company, Digital Influence Group , a   firm. \nRacepoint still has ambitious expansion plans. Prodromou, who is 53, says the 200-person firm will open its fourth Chinese office later this month, in Shenzhen. He would like to open a location in Germany later this year, and is also looking at expanding the Washington office. Advertisement \nRacepoint expects about $35 million in revenue this year, but Larry Weber aims to triple that before he walks away. \n“I would go nuts if I retired,” Weber says. “I’d like to see this through. Although I’m prone to exaggeration sometimes, I think we could have close to a $100 million company in total revenue in five years.”— JON CHESTO White shoes look totally trippy under a blacklight \nFoley Hoag is all-in on marijuana. No, you won’t see clouds of smoke emerging from the high-end law firm’s Seaport headquarters — well, let us know if you do — but a handful of its attorneys have launched a cannabis practice. \nThe idea is to attract some of the big-money pot players sniffing around the state’s forthcoming recreational pot market, which is projected to be worth $1 billion-plus but is currently shrouded in legislative and regulatory uncertainty. \n“It’s highly technical regulatory work that requires attorneys who know both politics and the law,” says Kevin Conroy , a former deputy attorney general and onetime Martha Coakley campaign manager who’s leading the new practice. “We see some similarities to the [2012] gambling initiative, which we worked on.” \nBefore launching the practice, Conroy polled similar law firms in pot-friendly states such as Colorado. Turns out they made a bunch of money — or, as Conroy puts it, “they had success bringing in clients who could pay our rates.” \nFoley Hoag has launched a blog to track potential changes to the marijuana initiative approved by voters last year, and is already talking to prospective clients. \nOh and for what it’s worth, Conroy hasn’t smoked weed since college, and “never particularly loved it.”— DAN ADAMS ArtLifting extends reach \nAs we’ve reported in this column, the Boston company ArtLifting , which sells art made by homeless and disabled people, achieved a business-plan milestone when it signed its first licensing deal last year: It partnered with Leesa Sleep to sell mattresses that have ArtLifting artwork woven into their fabric. \nSince then, ArtLifting has been brokering licensing deals galore. \nIn each one, designs by its artists — it works with 100 in 17 states — are incorporated into other companies’ products. \nThe artists receive 55 percent of ArtLifting’s proceeds from each sale, an arrangement meant to financially empower them, since ArtLifting is a “profit-with-purpose business” that aims to do social good as well as make money. \nBesides Leesa Sleep, ArtLifting recently paired up with Starbucks (to sell limited-edition gift cards), the California eyeglass maker ThinOptics (to sell glasses and eyeglass cases), East Boston’s Parlor Skis (to sell custom skis), and Costco (to sell posters). \n“It’s been a pretty wild last couple of months,” says ArtLifting cofounder Liz Powers. Many consumers “want to buy from socially conscious companies, and the mainstream companies are aware of that,” she adds, “so it’s really exciting to see them featuring our artists’ work on their brands.”— SACHA PFEIFFER Uber competitor Fasten hires Zipcar exec as CFO \nBoston-based Uber competitor Fasten has a new money man. Earlier this week, the company announced it has hired David Piperno as chief financial officer. Piperno has some experience in the transportation space. He joins Fasten from Boston-based Zipcar , the car-sharing service, where he worked as vice president of strategy and finance. \nPiperno also has experience with corporate acquisitions. He joined Zipcar from Avis Budget Group after Avis bought the startup in 2012. Earlier in his career, he worked on mergers and acquisitions at Deloitte . But if Fasten hired Piperno in hopes of finding a buyer, Piperno says, it never came up with recruiters. \n“No, not at all,” he says. “This is completely about fund-raising and expansion of the existing business model.” \nFasten last year raised about $10 million in venture funding. For now, the company operates in just two cities: its hometown, Boston, and Austin, Texas, where it has sought to take advantage of Uber and Lyft leaving the market due to political disagreements last year. It’s gained some traction in Austin, where Fasten will serve as the official ride-hailing service of the city’s annual South by Southwest conference and music festival. — ADAM VACCARO Can’t keep a secret?
