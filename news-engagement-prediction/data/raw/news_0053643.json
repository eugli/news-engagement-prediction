News 23 Feb 2017, 21:11 IST Naomi relinquishing her title on SmackDown Live What’s the story? \nFormer WWE SmackDown Women‘s Champion Naomi recently spoke with Lilian Garcia on her podcast, Making Their Way to the Ring . Naomi talked about getting booted from Total Divas yet again. She also revealed the inspiration behind her Feel The Glow gimmick. \nWhen asked for her comments on getting booted out of the show, Naomi said the following: \nI never could get a straight answer, and I think there are a lot of us girls, and I don’t know if it’s just them wanting to give everyone an opportunity, or they just like the idea of switching people in and out, to give the fans a different taste In case you didn’t know... \nThis week’s SmackDown Live started on a solemn note, as Naomi was forced to relinquish her WWE SmackDown Women’s Champion due to the injury she suffered at Elimination Chamber. After she had handed over her newly won title, GM Daniel Bryan announced a match between Bliss and Becky Lynch for the vacated title. \nAlexa Bliss regained the title after defeating Lynch, albeit with a little help from Mickie James. With a blow to @BeckyLynchWWE 's throat and a roll-up, @AlexaBliss_WWE has REGAINED the #SDLive Women's Championship!!! pic.twitter.com/ZRPKR0MpwH The heart of the matter Naomi also spoke about her gimmick and confessed that it was inspired by a movie from the 80’ called, The Last Dragon. She further revealed that WWE wasn’t too thrilled about the idea and it took them two years to get on board with it. Here is what she had to say: The inspiration comes from a movie from the 80s, called The Last Dragon. It’s about this martial artist who is on this journey to find the glow. It’s all about him really at the end of the day finding his confidence. He had it all along. He just had to look within himself. It took me two years to get them to finally hear me out on this concept, this idea, and the entrance and everything. \nYou can listen to the podcast below: What’s next? \nWhile WWE refrained from revealing the details of the injury, SmackDown GM Daniel Bryan suggested that Naomi could be out of action for at least 30 days. Sportskeeda’s take \nWe wish Naomi a speedy recovery and hope that the injury does not derail her red hot momentum. \nSend us news tips at fightclub@sportskeeda.com Recommended", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T13:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:27:24.288+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
