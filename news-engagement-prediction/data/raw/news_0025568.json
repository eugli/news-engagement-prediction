Police were unable to confirm reports father-of-two Mr Bhandal, from Woolwich, south east London, was attacked after cracking a joke about Miss Petersen's make-up. Athletic-looking keep-fit fanatic Mr Bhandal, who ran a building firm, died in hospital around 3am on Saturday after suffering severe head injuries. It is understood Mr Vout was also taken to hospital after being bitten on the mouth during the altercation and losing part of his lower lip which was subsequently found on the floor. Police were unable to confirm reports father-of-two Mr Bhandal (pictured), from Woolwich, south east London, was attacked after cracking a joke about Miss Petersen's make-up A local report claimed he had declined an operation after being told he had to pay for it out of his own pocket. Neither of the two Britons held over the incident, which happened just after midnight on Friday at the four-star Lagos de Cesar Hotel in Puerto de Santiago, have been formally charged as is normal in Spain where charges are only laid shortly before trial. Mr Vout has been officially made an 'investigado', a new legal term in Spain which literally means 'under investigation'. It is likely, but unconfirmed at this stage, that Miss Petersen will have to remain on the island while the judicial probe continues. It is not known where in the UK she and her partner, who were staying at the same hotel as Mr Bhandal and his partner, are from. It is understood pathologists have ordered further tests to investigate whether he had a heart attack and how much alcohol had played a part. Friends took to social media to pay tribute to Mr Bhandal (pictured) in the hours after his death The results of the post-mortem have not been made public as is customary in Spain. The final expert conclusions about his death are expected to play a part in the formal accusation prosecutors will end up making against Mr Vout. Friends took to social media to pay tribute to Mr Bhandal in the hours after his death. One said: 'Gutted to hear about Daryl Bhandal. My thoughts are with his family and friends. RIP mate.' Graphic designer Brad Mulock added: 'Daryl Bhandal. Unbelievable. Totally and utterly unbelievable. RIP mate.' Friend Richard Specter said: 'RIP Daryl Bhandal. Absolute pleasure knowing you. Top bloke and a brilliant father. I know a lot of us are in shock and rightfully so. 'And for everyone paying tributes, I'm sure it'll be a huge comfort to his family to know he'll be missed by so many people. Sleep tight big guy.' Another Facebook post, written before the tragedy in the early hours of Saturday morning, revealed how Mr Bhandal had gone out with his young son and daughter on Boxing Day to hand out warm clothes to the homeless. Quality Solutions Group, the firm he was a director of, said at the time it was footing the bill for all the clothes. Friend Laura Brown added on Facebook today: 'From when I was a teenager and knew you as \"market boy\" to becoming a work colleague and friend over the years, you were one of the funniest, most generous, kindest blokes I've ever met. 'My heart breaks for your kids, Amy and your family, that they have lost you. 'No more WhatsApp voice notes or video messages, just can't stop thinking how terrible it is.'
