He said he got hiking boots for a co-conspirator trying to get to Syria, and passed along contact information for someone he thought was an ISIS recruiter. The group of terror wannabes included several New Jersey men.\nIf Saleh opted for trial, Assistant U.S. Attorney Alexander Solomon said the government would've shown Saleh was in contact with \"attack facilitator\" Junaid Hussain.\nSolomon said Hussain relayed instructions to Saleh on how to build a pressure cooker bomb like the one that killed three people during the 2014 Boston Marathon.\nHussain, a hacker with a big role in ISIS online recruitment, was killed in an August 2015 U.S. air strike in Syria.\nSaleh attended Vaughn College in Queens near LaGuardia Airport. (Alexander Cohn/for New York Daily News) As Brooklyn Federal Judge Margo Brodie made sure Saleh understood what he was doing by pleading, she asked if anyone threatened or forced him to plead.\nSaleh paused before saying yes.\nThe judge noted the hesitation and asked again if he'd been pushed into the plea.\n\"Partly. More like, my counsel said, between a rock and a hard place,\" he said.\nBoth Saleh and Mumuni are scheduled for May 16 sentencing. Saleh faces up to 53 years and Mumuni could get a maximum 85 years.\n\"In the name of ISIL's false and hateful ideology, these defendants attacked the law enforcement officers who work tirelessly to preserve the safety of our communities,\" said U.S. Attorney Robert Capers.\nSaleh's lawyer, Deborah Austern Colson, and Saleh's parents did not comment after the plea.\nSend a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:36:48.386+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
