Here's how to never miss a call again no matter where you are in the world, and yet still keep your iPhone or Android device. | Topic: Smartphones \nThruraya SatSleeve for iPhone \nI find it pretty weird that there's cellphone coverage on the top of Mount Everest , yet there are loads of dead spots in my neighborhood. One way to get guaranteed cellphone coverage anywhere in the world is to own a satellite phone, and now you can transform your existing smartphone into a satellite phone by just sliding it into a case. \nYes, that's right, you no longer need a dedicated satellite phone. What you need is a Thuraya SatSleeve . \nJust slide on the sleeve, and BINGO! You have a satellite phone. \nIn addition to offering support for calls and SMS messaging, the latest SatSleeves also have satellite data functionalities for emails, instant messaging, browsing and so on. \nYes, calls and data are going to cost you an arm and a leg (don't be surprised if it adds up to several dollars a minute depending on where you want to use your handset). But for those time when you just have to make - or receive - that call, nothing beats a satellite phone. \nThe SatSleeve comes in three flavors: SatSleeve for iPhone : Adaptor for iPhone 5/5s is inside the package (adaptors for iPhone 4/4s and iPhone 6/6S are available from Thuraya Service Partners) SatSleeve for Android : Adaptor for Samsung Galaxy S4 is inside the package (adaptors for Samsung Galaxy S3 and S5 are available from Thuraya Service Partners) SatSleeve+ : A universal sleeve compatible with a variety of iPhones and Android devices. \nThe SatSleeve also features a built-in rechargeable battery to extend the battery life of your smartphone, and there's an optional solar charger for those times your adventures take you far from a power socket. \nThe SatSleeve isn't cheap - it costs around $499 - but if you need coverage where there isn't a ground-based carrier service, this could very well be what you need.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T05:49:43.325+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
