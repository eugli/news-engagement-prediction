The Administration's decision to roll back transgender student protections shows that President Trump is set on abandoning his campaign promise to protect LGBT Americans from discrimination. \n“To worried transgender students across the nation, Democrats stand with you. All students, including those in the LGBT community, are protected by the Constitution and Title IX, regardless of this Administration’s attempt to undermine equality and security for all. As Vice Chair of the LGBT Equality Caucus and a founding member of the Transgender Equality Task Force, I will fight with everything I have to protect transgender children from the shameful and despicable attempts to strip away their rights. Every American, regardless of gender identity, deserves to be treated with respect, and we will ensure that happens.” \nTitle IX protects transgender students from sex discrimination, but the Obama Administration guidance provided schools with clarity on administering the policy and ensuring every student is protected under the law. ###", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T19:08:13.091+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
