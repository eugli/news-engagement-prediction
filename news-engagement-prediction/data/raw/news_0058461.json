Just take a look at the penguin who had to fight to get his wife back . It’s just a brutal world out there for all animals. Especially for the crab below that found itself in a battle with an octopus. \nScuba divers were filming a fight between a swimmer crab and a red octopus when the battle concludes with an awesome twist ending. I certainly didn’t see this coming. \nTake a look at the video below. This Crab’s Fight With An Octopus Has The Craziest Twist Ending \nIt’s pretty clear that one of the scuba divers clearly didn’t see that coming judging from his laughs which sounds a lot like Saint Nick himself. But of course, it was a seal that stole the show at the end. And this seal has actually been seen before, as he has been nicknamed Whiskers by the divers, and he uses the divers’ light to hunt for fish. \nHere’s what the video description said: \nWhile diving, we were surprised by our friend, ‘Whiskers,’ the harbor seal, who often shows up when we dive at night. Whiskers has learned to use our dive lights to help hunt fish, and having Whiskers show up is not an uncommon occurrence. After a while, Whiskers was gone and my eye caught some action going on to the left, and I realized that a red octopus was chasing a swimmer crab around the sand. I immediately split off to go investigate and film, and Patrick followed. It was a great battle until Whiskers showed back up. I love harbor seals. Look at these weird dogs that are wet all the time. \nYep, just weird dogs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:57:11.061+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
