For every challan issued for drunk-driving, speeding, using mobile phone while driving and overloading, police will send a letter to the district transport office to confiscate driving licence of the violator for three months. \nStarting Monday, police went one step ahead to rein in blatant traffic violatiors across the city. Police will recommend the confiscation even if the driver was challaned for the first time. \nPolice received an order in this context from the state transport commission. The step will help deterring rampant violations. The Supreme Court directed all the states to implement this rule because such offenders are a threat to safety on roads. \nAdditional deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Dharuv Dahiya said police will also record the whole process when the offender is penalised at five major points including Jagraon Bridge, Arora Cinema Chowk, Bharat Nagar Chowk, Basti Jodhewal Chowk and Khalsa College for Women, Ghumar Mandi. \n“Many people came up with complaints that they were being wrongly fined for an offence they did not commit. Sometimes they also complained of misbehaviour by traffic cops on the road. The video recordings will be proof of the violation and it will also capture if cops have misbehaved,” said Dahiya. \nHe added, “The recording will also deter the practice of offenders trying to get away by making cops talk to politicians or officers over the phone.” \nIn the first phase, police will put five main locations of the city under video surveillance, followed by the rest of the city in the second phase. \nDahiya further said police have launched awareness campaigns at schools for students and school van drivers. They will also hold surprise checking outside schools. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:12:45.436+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
