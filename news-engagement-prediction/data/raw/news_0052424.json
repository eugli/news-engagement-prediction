The decision by Lisbon's Court of Appeal sparked the Supreme Court fight, which was resolved on January 31.\nThe full 76-page ruling that sparked the new legal challenge by the McCanns was later released.\nJudges made it clear in their decision their job was not to decide whether or not the McCanns bore any criminal responsibility over their daughter's disappearance and it would be wrong for anyone to draw any inferences about the couple's guilt or innocence from their ruling.\nThe apartment from which Madeleine McCann disappeared in Praia da Luz, in the Algarve Credit: Clara Molden for The Telegraph B ut they added: \"It should not be said that the appellants were cleared via the ruling announcing the archiving of the criminal case.\n\"In truth, that ruling was not made in virtue of Portugal's Public Prosecution Service having acquired the conviction that the appellants hadn't committed a crime.\n\"The archiving of the case was determined by the fact that public prosecutors hadn't managed to obtain sufficient evidence of the practice of crimes by the appellants.\n\"There is therefore a significant, and not merely a semantic difference, between the legally admissible foundations of the archive ruling.\n\"It doesn't therefore seem acceptable that the ruling, based on the insufficiency of evidence, should be equated to proof of innocence.\"\nWatch | Madeleine McCann suspects - in 90 seconds 01:28 T he Supreme Court ruling meant Amaral was spared having to pay the McCanns the compensation he was ordered to hand them after the first court ruling in 2015. The payment was frozen when he launched his successful appeal.\nEarlier this month it emerged the ex detective, removed as head of the investigation into Madeleine's disappearance after criticising British detectives, was writing a new book about the unsolved mystery.\nThe McCanns, both 48, of Rothley, Leicestershire, have said they will sue if The Truth of the Lie is sold in Britain.\nThey said in a statement after learning of the Supreme Court ruling against them: \"What we have been told by our lawyers is obviously extremely disappointing.\n\"It is eight years since we brought the action, and in that time the landscape has changed dramatically, namely there is now a joint Metropolitan Police and Policia Judiciaria investigation which is what we have always wanted.\n\"The police in both countries continue to work on the basis that there is no evidence Madeleine has come to physical harm. \"We will of course be discussing the implications of the Supreme Court ruling with our lawyers in due course.\"\nIt is believed the McCanns are discussing the possibility of taking the case to the European Court of Human Rights.\nDisappearance of Madeleine McCann", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:40:24.076+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
