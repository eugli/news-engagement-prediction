Eye witnesses who spoke on the condition of anonymity told Sunday Vanguard that the criminals wore black masks to avoid recognition even as it was suspected that some of them were members of the community. \nThe witnesses narrated that after killing their victims, the cattle rustlers proceeded to the neighbouring village where they robbed people of their money. \nA resident of the town, Isah Adamu, who lost his younger brother in the shooting in Yanware, explained that he was merely lucky not to have been caught in the attack because he left his house to purchase some cooking ingredients only come back to meet the mess. \n“I was shocked when I was told through the phone by one of my neighbours that I should stop coming home and remain where I was. \n“I later decided to come back and see what was happening, \n“Among the two bodies, one was my brother,” he said. At the time of this report, a number of the remaining survivors have fled the town for fear of being attacked again.
