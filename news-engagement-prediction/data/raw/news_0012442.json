I think for me, it all needs to start with looking after myself on the inside. 'I do believe in using the right shampoo and conditioner for your hair type and needs though and listening to when it needs a break on the heat tools! 'If I’m going for a run I’ll just tie it up to keep it out of the way. I try to train every day, not too crazy but enough to work up a sweat, so my hair just needs to be practical so I don’t worry about it! Since I’ve been using Pantene Smart Pro-V, I find my hair feels a lot stronger and I’m much happier with the length.' Feeling good: Ellie is a firm believer in treating her insides well in order to reap the benefits with her external appearance Committed: Ellie said she tries to train everyday Clean living: Tales of musicians and bands living decadently on tour are rife throughout the music industry, however, hard-partying isn't Ellie's thing Unsurprisingly, Ellie is a role model to a legion of female fans and singer Amy Macdonald recently called her an inspiration. While she didn't attend the recent Women's March in London, Ellie expressed her support for those who did and wished she could have joined them. She said: 'I was really sad I couldn’t join all the incredible people in London last weekend, I have deep love, respect and admiration for everyone who marched across the globe for women’s rights and equality – it’s a topic very close to my heart.' Lifestyle choice: The Love Me Like You Do singer has been a vegetarian for three years Inspirational: Ellie is a role model to a legion of female fans and singer Amy Macdonald recently called her an inspiration Ellie added: 'It’s great for women to support each other and build each other up. I think inspiration is a very individual thing and we all find it from different sources, so I feel honoured to be that person for any woman and I take that responsibility very seriously.' A philanthropist as well as a musician, Ellie recently lent her support to a homelessness campaign after noticing the extent of the problem in England and she hopes to continue using her platform to do good this year. She said: 'I’m looking forward to continuing my charity work throughout 2017 and also continuing to raise awareness about sustainability issues, it’s something I’m really passionate about. 'And career wise, I’m really honoured to be nominated for Brit Award so that will be an amazing evening and to be in an all-female category is very exciting.'
