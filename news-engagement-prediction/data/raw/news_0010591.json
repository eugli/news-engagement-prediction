A contrast.\nNessebar is a ­centuries-old Unesco World Heritage Site with historic buildings and fortifications.\nYet just across the water is Sunny Beach, the country’s wildly popular modern holiday resort and certainly not a place that Unesco is likely to list any time soon.\nNessebar is on a peninsula – it was an island until a short causeway linked it to the mainland – and while only a short distance from the commercial hotspot, it feels a world away.\nKnown as the Pearl of the Black Sea, it is a living museum that reflects 3,000 years of history as it was settled, fought over, conquered and settled again.\nNessebar is a centuries old resort (Photo: Getty) Streets are thronged with tourists admiring the churches – Saint Sofia is impressive – and landmarks, while restaurants with stunning views are in no short supply.\nIt is also packed with the quirky and occasionally tacky tourist shops. Pop into a Russian doll shop and you’ll spot ones with faces of Stalin, Lenin and Putin.\nOnce you’ve “done” Nessebar, head inland on a journey through the Blue ­Mountains with our tour operator, Balkan Holidays.\nIt’s a two-hour trip from Nessebar through Burgas, the country’s fourth-largest city, via vineyards and spiralling up secluded roads to the hidden village of Zheravna.\nTowns are untouched by time (Photo: Getty) It acted as a retreat for ­Bulgarians escaping Ottoman rulers who refused to let them practise their Christian faith.\nAnd it is stunningly preserved, with a tour of its cobbled streets and 200 wooden houses, all built between the 18th and 19th century, making for an almost alien ­experience.\nThe mountain village has a population of just over 400 and the climax of our visit was at Saint Nicholas Church, built in 1834.\nIt is not just the villages that appear untouched by time.\nCoastline of the old town of Nessebar (Photo: iStockphoto) On our way back, we passed through a town that seemed to still be recovering from the Soviet era, with residential “blocks” simply given numbers. A stark reminder of the struggles Bulgarians have endured.\nOur base was the five-star Sol Nessebar Palace, a five-minute walk from the old town.\nAimed at families, it has excellent facilities, including two large pools and a water park.\nThe all-inclusive package offers a main restaurant plus Spanish, German and Italian options. There’s an enthusiastic animation team who keep kids happy, allowing parents to relax.\nThere are stunning modern resorts It’s rare to find a part of Europe that is affordable for many and also offers culture, history and scenery.\nAnd who wouldn’t want a Putin doll?\nBOOK IT Balkan Holidays has seven nights’ all-inclusive at Sol Nessebar Palace hotel from £643 per person. Price based on two sharing and departing from Gatwick on September 10. Transfers included. balkanholidays.co.uk , 020 7543 5555 TOP TIP Bulgaria is one of the oldest winemaking countries offering high quality and low prices.
