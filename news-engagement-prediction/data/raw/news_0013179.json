Worm said water levels will rise between one to eight feet around the world on average, however eastern Canada including Newfoundland is expected to see a higher than average rise.\n 'These ice shelves are collapsing from the inside out.'\n- Boris Worm The change in expected sea rise is connected to new evidence related to the instability of the Greenland and Antarctic ice shelves, which were previously thought to be stable.\n\"What we've been learning very recently is that these ice shelves are collapsing from the inside out. That means that the ocean is hollowing them out from underneath, the ocean that is warming,\" he said.\n\"The smoking gun that we've been looking for — lots of melt water, billions of cubic metres of melt water, in fact — hasn't been there, and so we were tricked into believing that nothing was happening, while all this time the ocean was eating away at these ice shelves.\"\nWith files from The Broadcast", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T19:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:23:45.630+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
