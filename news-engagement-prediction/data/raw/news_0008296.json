External Link: Panoramic Resources announcement \n\"The company's decision to place Savannah onto care and maintenance in May 2016, thereby preserving the remaining ore reserve during this current cycle of weak nickel prices, will allow us to resume operations with a short lead time and minimal capital investment,\" he said. \n\"When we started the Savannah project 12 years ago it only had a four-year mine life, but obviously we discovered a lot more ore and we ran for 12 years. \n\"Then about two or three years ago we discovered Savannah North and we didn't really know whether it was going to be an ore body because it was deeper and we were a bit unsure. \n\"But the drilling we've done over the past 12 months has proven up a significant resource base and we've now got something like three times as much nickel in the ground as we had when we started in 2004 and the grade is actually higher.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T22:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T06:29:59.489+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
