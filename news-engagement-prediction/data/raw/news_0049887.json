If one is willing to strive, one can go beyond all limitations and attain liberation, moving humanity from assumed stagnation to conscious evolution,\" Isha Foundation founder Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev said in the statement. \nDescribing the significance of Adiyogi, Vasudev said: \"It is essential that the coming generations on this planet are seekers, not believers. As philosophies, ideology, belief systems that don't stand the test of logic and the scientific verification will naturally collapse in coming decades, you will see the longing for liberation will rise. When that longing rises, Adiyogi and the science of Yoga will become very important.\" First Published: Monday, February 20, 2017 - 08:07 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T10:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T05:20:53.545+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
