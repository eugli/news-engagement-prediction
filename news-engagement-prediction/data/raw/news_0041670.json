Theo Walcott left red-faced as Arsenal fans slam club for 'disrespectful' gesture \nNow we appear to have some strong evidence to suggest that Stevie G was WAY better than the Brazilian. It comes after Coutinho was challenged to recreate one of Gerrard’s most famous goals. \nOn their way to winning the Champions League in 2005 Liverpool needed to beat Olympiakos and score three goals in the process to progress from the group stage. With the score at Anfield on that December night poised at 2-1, up stepped Gerrard to rifle the ball into the back of the net with a belting goal that sent the Kop into delirium. The moment Gerrard scored the vital goal (Getty) \nCoutinho had none of the pressure of the situation, a few people rather than 54,000 looking on and four attempts to recreate it. But despite James Milner’s encouraging words (‘I think Phil’s got half a chance of doing that’) the current Liverpool star was unable to do it. . @Phil_Coutinho takes on one of the great #UCL goals from @LFC legend Steven Gerrard…can he do it? #GoalsRecreated https://t.co/P1OPKSqzT0 \n— BT Sport Football (@btsportfootball) February 20, 2017 \nSo there we have it, proof (sort of) that Gerrard was the better of the two.
