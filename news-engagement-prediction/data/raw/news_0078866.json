I got out the binoculars and thought it must be a meteorite,\" Ms Peters said. \n\"I was sure it was something burning up from space … but now, I am sure it was just a plane with the sunrise highlighting its contrails,\" she said. \nDespite Ms Peter's verdict, many Facebook users were quick to disagree — with some rejoicing in what the close encounter might mean. \n\"No longer will the population outcast you for believing in aliens,\" one Facebook user posted. \n\"Don't want to alarm anyone but … the alien visitors are our friends,\" another person said. Photo: Lee-Anne Peters' footage of the object kickstarted numerous theories about what it could be. (Supplied: Lee-Anne Peters) Facebook experts to the rescue \nUniversity of Tasmania's head of the School of Physical Sciences, John Dickey, said the mystery object could be \"a piece of space junk\" re-entering the atmosphere. \n\"It's definitely not a meteorite — they tend to look more like shooting stars. I wouldn't call it a contrail of a plane either,\" he added. \nProfessor Dickey explained space junk could include \"old spacecraft\" which had broken-off the upper stage of a rocket. \nHe added that such material was becoming a lot more common in orbit and posed a danger to satellites circling the Earth. \nProfessor Dickey posited another theory that the object in the video could be \"high cloud, backlit by the rising sun\", which might explain the brightly-lit trail. \nFacebookers checking aircraft flight trackers narrowed it down to an Emirates Airbus A380 flight bound for Auckland which was scheduled to be in the airspace about the time the phenomenon occurred. \nAnother person suggested the \"fireball\" was caused by the dawn sunlight reflecting the \"wind drag over the wings\" of a plane. 'Fireball meteor' theory grounded \nAstronomer at Launceston Planetarium, Chris Arkle's, said he thought it was definitely a \"high flying aircraft\" and poured cold water on the \"fireball meteor\" theory. \n\"Apparently some international flights to and from New Zealand use Hobart as a way point,\" he said. Photo: Tasmanians captured images of the object as it streaked across the early morning sky. (Supplied) \n\"The length of time that the object was visible for and its apparent speed both support this hypothesis. \nIf the object was a fireball meteor it would be travelling much faster and generally not be visible for such an extended period. \n\"I would be surprised if it were de-orbiting space junk or a meteor for the reasons outlined above,\" he finished. \nIt is not the first time people have speculated about intelligent extraterrestrial life in the skies over Tasmania. \nThe story of a pilot who disappeared over Bass Strait in 1978 after reporting a UFO was one of the inspirations for the television drama series The Kettering Incident. \nIn 2015, UFO enthusiasts chronicled a list of \"unidentified aerial phenomena from a scientific perspective\", including an Tasmanian incident from March that year during which three men said they \"saw a light\" the size of a golf ball, which had \"shrunk\" to a small point of light after the men tried to approach it.
