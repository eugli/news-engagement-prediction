Per Mundo Deportivo (via Goal ), Bellerin is being eyed by Barca as a potential long-term replacement for Dani Alves—who left the Camp Nou for Juventus last summer—and the uncertainty surrounding Wenger's future could play into the Blaugrana's hands. Spain international Bellerin, 21, started his career in Barcelona's La Masia academy before leaving for the Emirates Stadium in 2011. He has regularly been linked with a return to Barca—most recently in October 2016, per Paul Hirst in the Times —but he then penned a deal at the Emirates to 2023 to briefly end speculation over his future, per Jeremy Wilson in the Telegraph . However, Barca are now in desperate need of a new right-back, and Bellerin has inevitably emerged as a prime target. CESAR MANSO/Getty Images Sergi Roberto—traditionally a central midfielder—is currently manager Luis Enrique's only reliable option on the right of defence as Aleix Vidal recently suffered an ankle injury that is set to keep him sidelined for five months, per BBC Sport . Deportivo La Coruna's Juanfran was initially touted as a potential emergency replacement for Vidal, along with Malaga's Roberto Rosales, per Sport . However, Bellerin is potentially seen as a long-term solution to Barca's right-back issues that have emerged since Alves departed. Vidal had only just earned the confidence of Enrique before he was injured, with Roberto having started the lion's share of La Liga games in 2016-17—16 to Vidal's five, per WhoScored.com .
