Photo by Robert Cohen, rcohen@post-dispatch.com \nThe Post-Dispatch seems bent on destroying one man's career. Jeff Roorda is the business manager and spokesman for the St. Louis Police Officers Association, but the Post-Dispatch wants him fired because it doesn't like what he says. Hardly a position the free press should be proud of. \nOne of the most vocal critics of Roorda's speech is columnist Tony Messenger (\"City’s police deserve better spokesman than Roorda,\" Feb. 19) . As the faux spokesman of the oppressed, Messenger is constantly lecturing the rest of us, who he seems to believe are less enlightened than he. But let's look at his actions. \nMessenger took a job in downtown St. Louis but chose to live as far from any minority population as he could and still say he's from St. Louis. He makes the 30-mile trek into the place where whites and blacks live together, lectures the rest of us on race, then heads back to Wildwood. In his column calling for Roorda's job, he spoke of the good works of Black Lives Matter, an anti-police hate group, and the minority of protesters who threatened police. \nHad he been in Ferguson every night for months, he would have seen people threatening police officers, throwing rocks and urine at them and promising to kill their families. Messenger can downplay what happened there to fit it into his enlightened white guy persona, but people who choose to raise their families in a diverse community do not need to be lectured to by a guy from white flight central. \nThe police need Jeff Roorda, but the Post-Dispatch could use a new Messenger. \nTom Jackson • Hazelwood", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T13:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T10:50:22.599+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
