I know that as a player I like to play with the ball and on the defensive side I'm not like that. Chelsea analysis: Fabregas delivers as Llorente proves credentials \n\"But it shows that I have adapted very well to his (Antonio Conte's) philosophy and what he wants. Hopefully I can learn more to play even more.\" \nChelsea are looking at a number of midfielders to strengthen the squad in the summer, including Franck Kessie and Bernardo Silva . \nFabregas will turn 30 in May, but feels he still has a lot to offer and added: \"What keeps me going is that I feel really good, I feel in great condition to play football for a very long time. \n\"I know that in my legs and in my mind that I have played many more games, for someone of 29, that I'm supposed too. But I feel young in my mind. Chelsea 3-1 Swansea City: Antonio Conte post match press conference \n\"Sometimes when you have played a long time and won a lot, you think 'ah I've done everything and know it all'. \n\"But then you realise in football you never know everything. I'm in a good moment, a good situation. Hopefully I have reversed the situation a little from the beginning of the season to now. Hopefully I can keep playing like that to keep my place.\" \nDespite spending much of Conte's first season on the bench, the former Arsenal captain has never complained publicly about the situation. Conte: Fabregas is playing his way into the Chelsea team \n\"Don't get me wrong, I want to play every match, every minute, like all players do,\" he said. \"But sometimes you have to fight for it. \n\"Sometimes the easy way is to escape, to say 'I don't play', get upset and say you want to leave, to create a drama. In my mind I decided 'no, I want to challenge myself'. \n\"Not everything comes easy in life, you have to fight sometimes against situations that you're not used to or that are against you in a way. \n\"That's what I'm doing and hopefully I can show the manager that he can trust me in games and in any moment he wants.\" In Pictures | Chelsea vs Swansea | 25/02/2017 In Pictures | Chelsea vs Swansea | 25/02/2017 1/32", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T05:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T01:13:34.372+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
