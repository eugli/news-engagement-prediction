A 23-year-old drunk hardware trader allegedly molested two air hostesses of Jet Airways flight on Mumbai-Nagpur flight, reports say. The air hostesses of flight no.9S24460 gave a written complaint to the flight captain against the accused, identified as Akash Gupta, who was travelling on seat no. 41E, a Times of India report says. The captain, Gopalsingh Mohansingh, 42, informed the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) about the incident and handed over Gupta, a native of Balaghat in Madhya Pradesh, to them. CISF contacted the Sonegaon police who arrested Gupta and registered an offence of outraging of modesty under section 354 of Indian Penal Code (IPC), the report adds. Cops interrogated Gupta and on Sunday produced him before the court which sent him to magisterial custody. Gupta had gone to Goa on a vacation. On return journey, he boarded the Jet Airways flight for Nagpur at Mumbai airport. Cops said Gupta, who had probably consumed liquor in Mumbai, grabbed the hand of the two air hostesses when they were serving him meal. The air hostesses immediately informed other crew members who stopped Gupta. But he argued with them too, so they informed the captain, the report adds.
