In reality, marble requires regular maintenance and care to keep it looking beautiful. \nAn engineered stone product allows consumers the look of marble in their homes, without the impractical downsides. \n“Essastone by Laminex is engineered to guard against staining, scratching and citrus acid marks, making it quick and easy to clean,” Valente says. \nTry essastone in Fino Venato for a soft marble look that features distinct brown-grey veining on a crisp white background. \n“We also have strong finishes in both our Laminate range, with 180fx Carrara Marble and Carrara Bianco,” Valente says. \nGrey \nForget stark whites, grey is being hailed as the staple colour for modern kitchens. \nShades of grey can be incorporated into kitchens in a number of ways, such as through the use of concrete floors or as a feature paint colour. \nWhile grey is a slightly more daring departure to the standard white, it is still a neutral colour that can easily be layered with other products and styles. \nTry using grey for the “fixed” elements of a kitchen, such as benchtops or splashbacks, and pairing with other colours and styles to suit current trends. \n“I think it is all about simplicity, so strong colours being used in a fixed format in a kitchen will fall away,” Valente says. “Keeping your palette simple and layering tangible colour is a much better way.” \nPhoto: Laminex \nPersonality \nAfter years of minimal kitchens dominating the market, experts are predicting character-filled kitchens will make a comeback. \nTry adding personality to your home with the more easily replaceable elements, such as tableware and appliances. \nInstalling open-shelving to display ceramics, vases and colourful appliances is an easy method for adding texture and interest to a kitchen. \n“We are seeing lots of coloured appliances in the overseas market, particularly the US,” says Mal Corboy, Schweigen ambassador and award-winning kitchen designer. \nAdding metallic and timber accents is another way to create a valuable point of difference. Materials in these shades can be applied to cabinetry, panelling and kickboards, as well as doors and tapware. \n“The Laminex Innovations Range has the stunning inclusions of soft gold by the way of Brushed Titanium,” Valente says. \nCustom design \nThe rise of custom-made furniture and personalised appliances are taking the concept of “kitchen personality” to the next level. \nCorboy advises home owners not to focus on recreating the previously popular triangle kitchen layout in their homes, but to create a design that works best for their lifestyle. \n“Don’t get too hung up on the refrigerator, sink and stove design triangle. This layout is now outdated thinking and we tend to design more in zones, for example, cleaning, food prep and storage zones,” he says. \n“Also remember to consider your lifestyle and the type of cooking and food you like, as this has a big impact on the design of your kitchen.” \nIf you’re a regular cook, invest in quality appliances to make this everyday experience more enjoyable and relaxed. \n“As a designer, we are talking to our clients a lot more about how they use all their appliances to meet their home life and cultural needs,” Corboy says. \n“When it comes to the kitchen, it’s going to be all about personalisation.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T07:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:01:29.294+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
