He got the job through recommendations from his church pastor. Advertisement \nUnfortunately for the christian school and the students, it was then that Uncle Wong revealed himself as a gay. For 3 years, he molested boys while helping them with their homework and giving them sweets. The abuse was finally uncovered on September 13, 2013 when two students and a guardian saw Wong slip his hand under the table and into a 10-year-old boy's shorts to play with his penis. \nThe guardian immediately reported Wong to the student care centre's supervisor. Soon, Wong was suspended from work at the centre. When the HR manager told Wong that he was suspended and asked for him to meet him in church, Wong replied \"Can't figure out what went wrong or the complaint, so will just have to assure my heart before God\". However, he called three of his victims immediately and told them not to tell anyone about him molesting them. \nSeveral victims testified against Wong and the HR manager reported Wong to the police. Wong was sentenced to 10 years' jail on February 22, 2017. He was charged with 13 counts of sexual assault involving boys aged 8 and 11. Besides molesting 11 boys, he had also performed oral sex on a 11-year-old boy and forced the boy to suck on his penis after he was done. \nWong plans to appeal his conviction and sentence. He is currently out on $100,000 bail, pending the hearing of his appeal against his conviction and sentence. \nHenry ASS Contributor Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
