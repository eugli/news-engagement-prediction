You have to say we have to be prepared but he (Mignolet) was surprised,\" Klopp said. \n\"Even if he was prepared it would have been difficult to save it because it was hit well and right in the corner.\" Roberto Firmino wasted a glorious chance to equalise four minutes after the interval, scooping the ball horribly over the bar in front of goal, but his blushes were spared in the 57th.\nJordan Henderson lofted a pass to the far post, James Milner showed great strength to head the ball across goal and Wijnaldum nodded down and past Courtois. \nChelsea had the better chances thereafter but Mignolet redeemed himself for his earlier lapse with the penalty save from Costa. \nLiverpool ended the month with one win from nine matches in all competitions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T21:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T11:05:38.804+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
