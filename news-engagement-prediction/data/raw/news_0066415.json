Users can subscribe to this plan by paying a one-time fee of ₹99. Even if they don't opt for this plan, they can still enjoy free calling service on Jio. \nThere are other plans listed on the Jio website as well but the Happy New Year scheme is the most attractive. \nIn the face of Jio's offers, the older players have also stepped up their game and moved to match it with competitive offers of their own. \nAirtel \nTo tackle Jio's free voice service, India's biggest telecom company introduced the MyInfinity plans under which users will get 3 GB data, and unlimited calls and SMS free every month. They get extra data on top of this basic package depending on the plan they sign up for. For instance, for the ₹549 plan which is the cheapest, the user will get an additional 3 GB of data every month. If they pay more they get an extra 5 GB or 10 GB over and above the basic package. \nThe company is also offering something called Airtel Surprises, which selects users and sends them an offer where they can get 10 GB extra data by paying just ₹100. However, this scheme is not listed on the Airtel website. For prepaid users, the company is giving 3 GB data free with a recharge of ₹345, along with free calling.

For ₹150, users can get 1 GB of 4G data with a validity of 30 days. A ₹250 pack offers 1 GB data free with an additional 3 GB data. \nOther plans offer 6 GB data for ₹350, 9 GB data for ₹450, 13 GB data for ₹650, 22 GB data for ₹999 and 35 GB data for ₹1,500. All these plans have a validity of 30 days. \nIdea \nWhile Vodafone and Idea merger talks are ongoing, the company is not sitting back idle, offering users competitive plans along with free unlimited voice services. For new 4G handsets, Idea is giving 3 GB extra 4G data, along with 1 GB on a recharge pack of ₹348. The number of recharges allowed in a year is 13. \nFor ₹499, Idea offers 3 GB of free 4G data along with national roaming and unlimited free calling. Similar benefits can be availed by consumers for ₹999 along with 8 GB free data.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:04:55.363+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
