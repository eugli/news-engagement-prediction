Owners started noticing the casing had chips where the aluminum was visible beneath the anodized surface. In some cases the iPhone arrived with the chips already visible.\nAs spotted by 9to5Mac , it looks as though that same issue is happening again with the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus , but only on matte black models.\nApple's support forum is slowly filling up with reports of the matte black iPhones being chipped (three pages long at the time of writing). These chips expose the silver aluminum underneath and can occur within the first month, or even first week of ownership. Even if the iPhone is protected inside a case, chips can appear.\nThe chips occur most often around the volume button and speaker grille, but they can also happen along any of the edges or on the back of the smartphone. The matte black iPhone 7 Plus seems to suffer from the problem more than the smaller iPhone 7 .\n\nThe headache for iPhone owners is Apple's policy on case damage. As it's viewed as \"cosmetic damage,\" which occurs through normal daily use, Apple doesn't cover it under warranty. Even if a chip appears after a few days, it's still cosmetic damage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:53:11.623+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
