Tolkien — yes, that Tolkien, as in the author of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings — will appear in the season finale of DC’s Legends of Tomorrow . \nOn Tuesday, executive producer Marc Guggenheim tweeted a photo of the cast list for the season finale, which will include the return of Katie Cassidy as Laurel Lance as well as J.R.R. Tolkien. Of course, Tolkien, who died in 1973, will not actually appear, but a younger version of him will be portrayed by Jack Turner ( Stitchers ). \n“The Tolkien idea actually was an idea we’ve had for the entire season,” executive producer Marc Guggenheim recently told EW while on set for the penultimate episode. “Very early on, when we were planning out season 2, we made a list of fun time periods that we want to visit, and the writing staff had this idea that we could do a Lord of the Rings homage in the trenches of World War I.” \nFurther details on why Tolkien will appear are being kept under wraps, but we can tease that it has to do with the Spear of Destiny. \nTolkien’s inclusion comes in the wake of the show also introducing a younger version of director George Lucas . After a run-in with the Legends and the Legion of Doom, Lucas decided to quit film school, leading to Ray (Brandon Routh) and Nate (Nick Zano) losing their respective inspirations — Star Wars and Indiana Jones — before the team encouraged the prolific director to get back in the game. \nDC’s Legends of Tomorrow airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET on The CW.
