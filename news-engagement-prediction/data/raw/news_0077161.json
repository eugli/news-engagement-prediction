Photo: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Following the news that Bill Paxton had died at the age of 61 , many of his coworkers and admirers in Hollywood spoke shared their memories of the venerated actor. Among Paxton’s biggest fans would seem to be his bosses, the directors who caught the film performances from him that would become his most famous parts. James Cameron, who worked with Paxton on The Terminato r, Aliens , Titanic and more, called Paxton a “creative dynamo” while Ron Howard, Paxton’s director on Apollo 13 , compared the actor to a friendly tornado that could be a good sport in even trying circumstances. Howard wrote in a tribute given to The Hollywood Reporter, “Unlike the Twisters he famously chased in the movies, Bill Paxton was the kind of force of nature you ran toward and never away from .” The director went on to explain Paxton’s “charm” and “admirable joie de vivre” on the set of Apollo 13 .\nHe loved adventure, and no one was happier than Bill when we were filming our zero-G scenes for Apollo 13 out over the Gulf of Mexico in NASA’s KC-135, nicknamed The Vomit Comet.

Cool!” Read the rest of the tribute here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T03:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T06:01:56.480+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
