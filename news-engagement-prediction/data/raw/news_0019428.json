Read Tweet The clothing brand Tommy Hilfiger used Hrithik Roshan's picture for promotional purpose. By Maggie Davis | Updated: February 10, 2017 8:44 AM IST Comments Hrithik Roshan Check out first pictures of Ranveer Singh, Sunny Leone, Bipasha Basu, and other celebs welcoming New Year 2017! Hrithik Roshan has already been through a lot of issues that another one has been added to his kitty. We have hardly seen him getting upset and showing it up on social media through tweets or any other form. Even when his recently released film ‘Kaabil’ clashed along with Shah Rukh Khan’s gangster drama ‘Raees’, he did not react over it. But now what happened has literally left him fuming and the actor has shown it up on his Twitter account. The handsome hunk has slammed the clothing brand Tommy Hilfiger. The popular clothing brand Tommy Hilfiger has apparently misused pictures of Hrithik Roshan and his sons Hrehaan and Hridhaan. The tweet posted by him shows clearly that Hrithik is highly upset of what the clothing brand did for promotional purpose. The 43-year-old actor tweeted saying, “Dear Tommy.I dont wear u, neither do my kids endorse u. If u hv lost ur spine I hv a great team 2help u find it.Please (hil)figure urself out”. Take a look at the tweet below which he shared few hours ago: Dear Tommy.I dont wear u, neither do my kids endorse u.If u hv lost ur spine I hv a great team 2help u find it.Please (hil)figure urself out pic.twitter.com/QMB2h9Gm0y \n— Hrithik Roshan (@iHrithik) February 9, 2017 Looks like Hrithik Roshan who is pretty much upset with this thing, is set to find things out with the help of his team. However, the clothing brand has not yet responded to it and neither Hrithik has posted anything after that. Be it personal or professional life, Hrithik has not been able to lead a peaceful life since few years. He has been dragged into unnecessary controversies or problems like such happen. (ALSO READ: CONFIRMED! Hrithik Roshan & Sussanne Khan have no plans to reunite ) Recently in an interview when the ‘Kaabil’ star was asked on how he deals with failure and heartbreak he was quoted saying, “I enjoy them! (smiles) The only two ways to grow in life is when you are proven you are wrong or when you’ve made a mistake. When the results come and you are shown that something you did was wrong, that is the truth. That is the breaking away of illusion, which is why they call it disillusionment,” reports DNA. He continued saying, “So that is actually good as you can recalibrate yourself and you need to have the humility to allow yourself to be broken and you have to have the courage to remake yourself. And I have both, so I have no fear. I can deal with both failure and triumph and still be okay.”   8:38 AM IST | Updated Date: February 10, 2017 8:44 AM IST", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T10:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T05:25:42.602+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
