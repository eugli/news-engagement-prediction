Confirming the incident on KTN News on phone, Raila said a group of more than ten youths armed with AK47 rifles charged towards the podium forcing them to flee for their safety.He said the fire exchange at the venue lasted for ten minutes.Fortunately, nobody was hurt during the incident.Raila retreated to Lodwar town where his security was assured. Raila, however, said that he could not understand how the police could allow the armed youth get to the venue saying the incident had forced the leadership to abandon the rally.According to him, there was a possible conflict arising from discrimination in the distribution of relief food to hunger stricken families in the county.He accused Turkana Central MP, John Lodepe Nakara of giving relief food to Jubilee supporters and leaving out those allied to the opposition.
