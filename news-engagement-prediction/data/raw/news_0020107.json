Image: youtube/soulja Boy By Johnny Lieu 2017-02-08 04:37:49 UTC \nRemember your salad days? Shouting the lyrics to Lil Jon and the Eastside Boyz track \"Get Low,\" or actually enjoying Evanescence's \"Bring Me To Life\" before it became a meme? \nWell prepare for your mind to be blown, because it turns out they work very well when mashed up together. SEE ALSO: 'Chicken Attack' is an oddly great music video featuring a transforming ninja chicken \nThe Magic iPod is a website that lets you mash together the finest hip hop hits of the mid-2000s with popular rock tunes from the same era, like \"Helena\" by My Chemical Romance, or The White Stripes' \"Seven Nation Army. Ah, the memories. \nYou're given about 20 songs from each genre, and only certain combinations are allowed. But it does mean the mashups sound utterly perfect together, likely because they've been pre-edited. \nImage: the magic ipod \nWe particularly enjoy \"Get Low\" blended with the inimitable \"All Star\" by Smash Mouth for its ridiculousness. \nBut for those who derive non-ironic pleasure from music, the combination of \"Lose Control\" by Missy Elliott and \"You Only Live Once\" by The Strokes does well, as does Kanye West's \"Touch The Sky\" mixed with Weezer's \"Island In The Sun.\" \nWe'd probably steer away from any combinations with Blink 182's \"I Miss You,\" unless you're looking to dig up long buried memories of high school romances. \nWhile the combinations may be limited, you'll spend a lot of time trying to sift through them all. There's no ads on the site either, with just a note to donate to the ACLU. \nNostalgia and money going to a good cause? It's a win-win.
