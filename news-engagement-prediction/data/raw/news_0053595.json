It can have only two of those amenities. \n“I was kind of mystified when I got here and found out you couldn’t build them,” said Kingston. \nKingston said accessory dwelling units were originally banned decades ago to crack down on substandard housing in South Dallas. \n“They, in my opinion, reacted to a different problem with a solution that didn’t fit that problem,” said Kingston. \nHe is trying to pass an ordinance to bring back garage apartment and he wants to build one himself. \nKingston feels it would help younger families afford payments to buy a home and create more affordable housing. \n“These are the way these neighborhoods were built originally. I just want to restore them to their original design,” said Kingston. \nThe council member does not anticipate a few new studio rentals adding much to traffic and city code already has height and lot-size restrictions for those concerned about privacy. \nBlaker also feels she, the homeowner, is a safeguard. \n“If I’m living in front of that, I’m going to be really cautious about who I’m going to rent to.” \nNext month, the ordinance hits the city planning commission then could go before council for a vote. If allowed, the units would be approved on a neighborhood-to-neighborhood basis through public hearings. \n  Jeff Paul facebook Follow Reporter Jeff Paul joined the CBS 11 News team in 2014.
