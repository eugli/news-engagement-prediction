This article is updated each month with new suggestions and tours. Cut-price winter sunshine \nWhen: February and March 2017 \nWhy book now? Act fast to exchange the chill of early spring in Britain for a spell of warm sunshine at a knock-down price. \nWhat to book: For bookings made by tomorrow , Trailfinders (020 7368 1200; trailfinders.co.uk ) is offering discounts on February and March departures. They include a £400 per person reduction on seven nights at the three-star Coco Palm Resort in St Lucia, right, from £1,049 per person b&b (full review at telegraph.co.uk/tt-cocopalm ). There’s more time to book a week at the all-inclusive five-star Occidental Xcaret hotel on Mexico’s Riviera Maya, where a £450 per person discount is available on bookings made by January 31, also through Trailfinders. Prices start at £1,749 on selected February departures. Both packages include direct flights and transfers. Kuoni (0800 144 8026; kuoni.co.uk ) also has offers on a range of winter escapes. Easter ski chalets for families \nWhen: March and April 2017 \nWhy book now: Easter falls late this year (April 16), which is pushing family bookings into a narrower time frame than usual. Operators report heavy demand for family ski chalets in the first week of the main school holidays (starting April 1 or 2). The best choice of accommodation is in the week of March 26, before state schools break up, or from April 9, returning on Easter weekend. \nWhat to book: Méribel chalet specialist Meriski (01285 648518; meriski.co.uk ) has no options left for the week of April 2. But there is availability in the weeks either side, including Chalet L’Ardour, right, sleeping up to 14 and starting at £1,095 (adult) or £995 (child) from March 26, or Chalet Phoebe, sleeping up to 11, starting at £920 (adult) and £820 (child) from April 9. Prices exclude flights and transfers. Ski Total (01483 345686; skitotal.com ) has chalets available in Austria, France and Italy. Now's the time to bag an Easter ski break Credit: ALAMY Long-haul flights for next Christmas \nWhen: December 2017 \nWhy book now? One of the busiest and most expensive periods to take a long-haul flight is from mid-December when the Christmas rush gets under way. If you know that you will be locked into this travelling period in 2017, take the opportunity to buy your air ticket now. Booking windows for the big scheduled carriers open around a year ahead of travel, so this month is a good time to look out for flash sales or to secure an early-bird fare. For travel in quieter travelling periods, or if you are flexible on dates, then bide your time as there are likely to be good deals closer to departure. \nWhat to book: Flights to Australia, above, or New Zealand, and other long-haul destinations. Book direct with airlines or through a booking agent. The latter include Austravel ( austravel.com ), Trailfinders ( trailfinders.com ), Travelbag ( travelbag.co.uk ) and Dial-A-Flight ( dialaflight.com ).

Tours where the extra charge for single occupancy of a twin or double room is waived book up quickly, so avoid this often hefty supplement by securing a place before they disappear. \nWhat to book: New for 2017, Great Rail Journeys (0800 240 4470; greatrail.com ) has unveiled a selection of more than 20 tours that have no solo supplement if booked before January 31. These include some departures of the eight-day Traditional Glacier Express tour, right, starting at £1,275 including travel and some excursions. Cultural tour specialist Martin Randall Travel (020 8742 3355; martinrandall.com ) has no single supplement on the two-night In Churchill’s Footsteps itinerary, departing September 21. Guests stay at Ditchley Park in Oxfordshire and enjoy a private visit to the Churchill War Rooms in the company of historian and Churchill expert Terry Charman. Big cat safari in Kenya with Jonathan Scott \nWhen: October 2017 \nWhy book now? This is a rare opportunity to join one of Britain’s most widely respected wildlife broadcasters and naturalists on a safari in Kenya. Departing in autumn this year, the tour is likely to sell out quickly. \nWhat to book: This 10-day Telegraph Tour (from October 31 to November 9) is operated by Africa Travel and will take you to the majestic plains of the Maasai Mara in Kenya, a place Jonathan Scott calls “the ultimate big cat destination”. The author, naturalist and presenter of the BBC’s Big Cat Diary will join you on this escorted tour, giving context to some of the great scenes of east Africa. You will have the chance to spot the Big Five during the game drives you will take, including the magnificent lion prides that Scott has followed for much of his life. From £4,995 including all flights, meals and entrance fees. Bookings (03332 226 443; telegraph.co.uk/tt-safari ). Luxury cruise deals \nWhen: 2017 to 2018 \nWhy book now? Now is the time to think ahead if you want to save money on a cruise this year and into 2018. Offers are available on drinks packages too. Explore Spain on a luxury cruise \nWhat to book: For bookings made by February 28, Celebrity Cruises (0844 493 2043; celebritycruises.co.uk ) is offering up to £500 off the price of an Ocean View stateroom or higher cabin categories on some Europe and Abu Dhabi cruises, and up to £250 off accommodation on worldwide cruises. The offer also includes a “classic” drinks package and, for families, accommodation savings of up to £100 per child (based on two sharing). A 10-night Spain, France and Italy cruise calling at ports including Alicante, above, and departing on October 9 2017 starts at £1,389 per person, while a 10-night Arabian Coast Immersion cruise departing on November 27 2017 starts at £979 per person. Prices are on a cruise-only basis and include the discount. Early-bird discounts for 2017 \nWhen: Throughout 2017 \nWhy book now? January is always the busiest month for holiday bookings. Now that Christmas is over, there is a surge of interest as we try to cheer ourselves up by thinking about our summer break. So travel agents and tour operators are doing their best to ride that wave with a welter of early-booking offers and value-added deals. If you have to travel in peak summer, and know your dates and where you want to travel, it makes sense to secure your travel and accommodation as soon as possible. The Heatseeker: find your perfect holiday \nWhat to book: Anything that involves travelling during the school holidays and which you think is being offered at a good price. Be aware, however, that some offers are not always as good as they seem. For example, an offer of free child places might sound attractive but may not be much of a saving for families who plan to self-cater. \nThese “free” places won’t count towards room occupancy – so if you are booking a four-person apartment with a free child place, for example, there is likely to be an “under-occupancy” supplement charge to take into account. \nPrice matching and low deposit promises also sound tempting, but it’s essential to check the terms and conditions before you book.
