That's according to a loose-lipped \"high-ranking official for a mobile network provider,\" speaking to ETNews . \nThe source is speaking specifically about the South Korean launch territory. But historically Samsung has aimed for day-and-date releases around the globe, so at the very least this could give an indication as to window for release, if not the exact date. \nIn fact, it actually represents a delay as far as the source is concerned. \"The release date of Galaxy S8 in South Korea has changed from the 14th of April to the 21st of April due to reasons such as size of supplies and others,\" the source states. What's left to find out? \nThough we're expecting to get an glimpse of the Galaxy S8 at next week's big MWC 2017 smartphone blowout, Samsung has already confirmed that the handset will be getting its own big, separate glitzy launch event. \nNot that there will be much left to reveal â€“ the leaks have been coming thick and fast, with rumors pointing towards a 4K or QHD screen, 5.8 and 6.2 inch size options and a super wide 18.5:9 aspect ratio. \nWe'll be live from Barcelona from this Sunday (February 26) to give you all the coverage straight from MWC, so stay locked on TechRadar for all the latest news.
