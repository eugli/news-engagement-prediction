Since tripping an Elon player on Dec. 21, his every move has been questioned, along with his intent. \nAmid the scrutiny, Allen has apparently found a voice of support from an unlikely backer. \nAhead of Thursday night's Tobacco Road rivalry game between North Carolina and Duke, Tar Heels head coach Roy Williams shared his thoughts on Allen's situation, calling the scrutiny \"way, way, way blown out of proportion,\" via The News & Observer . \n\"I see him trying to get over a screen and everybody here try it,\" said Williams. \"You put all your weight on one foot, what does your other leg do? It goes back. So I see all those things. I think he's a wonderful kid who he himself, and Mike Krzyzewski himself, has said has made some mistakes.\" \nAfter serving the one-game suspension for the first incident this season, Allen has not been able to stay out of the spotlight. Time and time again he has been at the center of controversy and questioning for flailing arms and/or legs and colliding with opponents in, shall we say, somewhat unnatural movements. Guilty or not, he's been the most talked about player in college basketball because of it. \nUNC guard Joel Berry II , a former AAU teammate of Allen's, said the limelight comes with a microscope. But he's surprised Allen has been examined so closely to this day. \n\"They try to find the littlest things, but that's what happens, that's what the media does, and it's all part of it,\" Berry said. \"I think now with him being (on) the radar like he is, he just has to be twice as good. You can't just get into situations where like I think N.C. State, he tried to walk through their huddle. \n\"You might as well just walk around the huddle. ... You might as well just try to stay out of the media.\" \nSimple advice from a former teammate, and words that would benefit Allen greatly if he took heed to them. \nNorth Carolina and Duke play on Thursday evening at 8 p.m. ET.
