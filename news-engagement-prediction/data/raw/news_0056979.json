The intent was to suspend suspected drug users’ ability to re-enter the park in which they were cited for 90 days, but the notices took effect immediately — with the option to appeal the order later. \nThat was the problem cited in a ruling by a Denver County judge, who dismissed the charges against a man who was cited after police observed him smoking marijuana in Commons Park in October. \nThe ability to contest a park suspension should be offered before the ban takes effect, Judge Clarisse Gonzales concluded. \nHer dismissal order says: “As the park suspensions under Temporary Directive 2016-1 take effect immediately, within the pure unchecked discretion of any police officer on the scene, and with a complete lack of any pre-deprivation due process, the suspensions violate procedural due process protections, and are found unconstitutional for this reason.” \nThe judge noted that using the administrative appeal process outlined in Haynes’ directive could take up to 27 days, even if a person contested the suspension notice immediately. In the meantime, the park suspension still would be active. \nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado, which was involved in the case that resulted in Wednesday’s order, has pushed Denver Parks and Recreation to stop enforcing the ban and has questioned the way it has been carried out. As of late January, 40 people received suspension notices. The last one was issued Nov. 8. Related Articles January 26, 2017 ACLU asks Denver to stop enforcing drug user ban in parks amid decline in suspensions \nParks officials and the Denver city attorney’s office did not immediately return requests for comment Wednesday. \nThe ACLU got involved in the case of Troy Holm in Gonzales’ court. His attorney, Adam Frank, filed a motion to dismiss the charges of trespassing and violation of Holm’s 90-day ban from Commons Park. \nHolm had faced potential penalties of up to $999 and a year in jail for violating the notice by re-entering Commons Park three days after his suspension. \n“The court’s ruling affirms a bedrock principle of due process: the government cannot take away our rights without first providing, at a minimum, notice of the accusation and a fair opportunity to defend against it,” ACLU of Colorado legal director Mark Silverstein said in a news release. \nHolm’s suspension notice expired in mid-January. \nHaynes’ temporary directive allowing the park bans is set to expire Sunday. Parks officials have not announced whether they plan to extend Haynes’ temporary directive or propose a permanent directive.
