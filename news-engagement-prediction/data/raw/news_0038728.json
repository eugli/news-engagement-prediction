Runway action just concluded in New York, and here’s a quick glimpse at all that trended. Snigdha Ahuja Hindustan Times Looks from the Anna Sui fall 2017 show during New York Fashion Week. The more than a week long showcase gave off lot of style inspiration for the next season.(NYT/Karsten Moran) \nFashion runways in London might be already on a roll, but we are still hungover on all that NYFW (New York Fashion Week) had on offer. The recently concluded fashion showcase, which kicked off on February 9, gave us a lot of fashion fodder and trend takeaways for fall/winter 2017. And, apart from all the sartorial inspiration, the inclusive runway encouraged social conversations and made more than just style noise. Here are our top ten picks: \n1. THENEW-AGEPOWERSUIT Labels Altuzarra, VFILES, Victoria Beckham and Malan Breton showcased many variations of the powersuit. (AFP) \nThe demarcation between womenswear and menswear gets blurrier by the day. Gender-fluidity on the runway has been trending for a few seasons now and New York was no exception. From structured and sharply cut to mono-toned layering for the fall, the powersuit made a big impact. \n2. SHIFTINGSHAPES Shifting shapes at Thom Browne, Alexander Wang, Creatures of Comfort and Pyer Moss. (AFP & REUTERS) \nThe shape clutter is being broken. For autumn, the silhouettes are anti-fit and anti-norm. The exaggerated shapes, large collars and hanging sleeves are on-trend, bringing back the statement ‘boyfriend jacket,’ oversized capes and size-easy toppers. \n3. FURFORWARD Creations by Zero + Maria Cornejo, Michael Kors and Jeremy Scott. (AFP & REUTERS) \nFrom Jeremy Scott to Michael Kors — lush plume-encrusted and fur-forward overcoats, capes and capelets made a lot of runway noise. They also made for the perfect topper for a layered look. \n4. LEATHERWEATHER Leather legs were in trend at La Perla and Alexander Wang. (AFP &REUTERS) \nIf fur refuses to budge from the winter style charts, so does leather. Leather leggings made their way on to the runway in New York, especially paired with minimal monochromatic looks. Cash into your pair for the next season, ladies. \n5. ONTHEHEELSOFQUIRK Footwear-forward at Marc Jacobs, Thom Browne, The Blonds and Tory Burch. (AFP&REUTERS) \nThigh-high boots might have been all over the fashion radar in 2016, but in New York, the statement heel got re-defined. While Marc Jacobs went for chunky platforms for his show, we saw ice-skating inspired heels at Thom Browne.
