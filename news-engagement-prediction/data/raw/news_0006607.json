Canlapan, Unilever Philippines Manager for Workplace Services and Facility Security; Alberto Curnelius Trinidad, Unilever’s Marketing Director for Close-Up; Joy Dalanon-Ocampo, Country Manager for Safety, Health and Environment; Procurement manager Melissa Alcayaga; Close-Up Assistant Brand Manager Bea Lagdameo. \nOthers in the complaint include Michelle Suzanne Claire Quintana, Anna Kristina Doctolero, Baby Majalia Ahamadul, Senior accounts manager of Activation Advertising Inc., Reginald Soriano, Eduardo Muego, John Paul Demontano, the owner and President of HypeHouse Production Corporation and Alexis Engelberto Aragon, owner of Delirium Manpower Services. ADVERTISEMENT \nBased on the complaint, Unilever and the event organizers failed to consider several factors despite boasting of a ready “security master plan” and “code red scenarios.” \nSome of the scenarios not including in the security master plan and code red scenarios include entry of illegal drugs in the event, no drug sniffing dogs only bomb sniffing K-9, no simulation exercise with the police and no coordination with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA). \n“The above-mentioned respondents from Unilever-Close-Up, Activation Advertising and the others appears to be criminally liable based on the responsible officer doctrine (ROD) for they held a position of responsibility and authority in their respective corporations and had the ability to prevent the unwanted incidents but failed to do so,” the NBI said in the complaint. \nBased on the autopsy and toxicological examination of the victims, they tested positive for a designer drug known as methylenedioxymethamphetamine or MDMA methylene homog and methylenedixy cathinone. These are new breed of drugs that are dangerous but not illegal as they are not included in the list of prohibited drugs under the Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.
