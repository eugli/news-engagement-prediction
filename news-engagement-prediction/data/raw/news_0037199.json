CRISPR intellectual property. They have given birth to companies that have licensed the technology for multiple—and in many cases overlapping—applications in human therapeutics, agriculture, and industry. Scientists hold major stakes in several companies (see table below). (Interactive)J. You/Science; (Graphic)G. Grullón/Science \nCRISPR first became a business with yogurt. \nThe dairy industry uses the bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus to convert lactose into lactic acid, which gels milk. Viruses called bacteriophages can attack S. thermophilus, spoiling the yogurt culture. In 2007, Rodolphe Barrangou and Philippe Horvath were working at Danisco, one of the world's leading makers of yogurt cultures, when they found that the S. thermophilus genome contains odd chunks of repeated DNA sequences—so-called clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), which Spain's Francisco Mojica had first described in 1993 in the genome of the salt-loving microbe Haloferax mediterranei. The Danisco team found that the CRISPR sequences match the phage DNA, enabling S. thermophilus to recognize and fight off infections. \nDuPont, which acquired Danisco in 2011, began using the insights to create bacteriophage-resistant S. thermophilus for yogurt and cheese production. Today, \"whether you've had yogurt in Tel Aviv or nachos in California, you've eaten a CRISPR-enhanced dairy product,\" says Barrangou, who is now a food scientist at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. \nYet the idea that CRISPR could serve as a general-purpose genome-editing tool did not surface until a 19 December 2008 Science paper by Erik Sontheimer and Luciano Marraffini at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. Sontheimer and his postdoc Marraffini were the first to show just how CRISPR protected bacteria: by identifying and crippling invaders' DNA. \"From a practical standpoint, the ability to direct the specific, addressable destruction of DNA … could have considerable functional utility, especially if the system can function outside of its native bacterial or archaeal context,\" they wrote. \nUSPTO, however, rejected their patent application. \"The vision and idea were out there, but we hadn't reduced it to practice,\" says Sontheimer, who is now at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester. \"When we filed our patent in 2008 there were a million mechanistic questions.\" \nIn 2011, Doudna co-started Caribou Biosciences as what she calls \"a research tool company\" to exploit the possibility that CRISPR could be used to simplify detection of viral infections like HIV. But the real flowering of CRISPR Inc. didn't begin until the next 2 years, when this obscure bacterial immune system showed its power as the versatile tool that Sontheimer and Marraffin had only imagined. First came Doudna and Charpentier's paper describing a CRISPRCas9 system that could cut DNA in a test tube. Six months later, in January 2013, Zhang (working with Marraffini), Church, Doudna, and a fourth group separately reported that they could export CRISPR-Cas9 to human cells, which meant that it might be put to work in medical treatments. \nThat was when Charpentier made the rounds, talking to one CRISPR expert after another about commercializing the technology far beyond the research tools Caribou was pursuing. Among those she approached was Zhang. \"It would have been really great to work with Emmanuelle,\" he says. \nBut geography intervened. Her team had a plan to be headquartered in Switzerland and was backed by a California-based VC firm, Zhang notes. He, on the other hand, \"had the opportunity to build a really strong team in Boston,\" he says. Boston-based investors were interested, and Eric Lander, Broad's president, served as a consultant for one of them. Lander declined requests to comment for this article, noting through a spokesperson that he had \"no business relationships with any of the CRISPR companies.\" But Lander acknowledged that he \"did meet with VCs to actively stimulate interest in forming companies to license the technology in ways that could maximize patient benefit.\" \nIt's been an incredible fight over credit. Everyone is trying to jockey themselves and minimize what others did. Erik Sontheimer, University of Massachusetts Medical School \nThe nascent partnership between Doudna and Charpentier's group also became strained, but both of them declined to discuss the details. \"It's delicate,\" Charpentier says. Says Doudna: \"She made various decisions about really going her own way with respect to her commercial involvement that I completely respect.\" \nAt this point, investors weren't tripping over themselves. \"When we said ‘CRISPR,’ people were a bit confused,\" Charpentier recalls. \"There's a lot of food associated with ‘crisper.’ You have crispy salad in Sweden. In the U.S., there are Krispy Kreme doughnuts.\" \nChurch says the field only drew serious investment, spawning new companies and new rivalries, after a team led by Harvard's Chad Cowan and Kiran Musunuru showed in the 4 April 2013 issue of Cell Stem Cell that CRISPR was far superior to existing genomeediting tools. Scientists had harnessed and commercialized other enzymes for genome editing, notably ones that relied on so-called zinc fingers and others known by the acronym TALENs (transcription activator-like effector nucleases). In the Cell Stem Cell paper, the researchers did a head-to-head comparison of CRISPR and TALENs. CRISPR, they found, was far more efficient at creating the targeted mutations. \"Up until that point, CRISPR was just another scissors,\" says Church, but now the new technique stood out. \nCowan and Musunuru teamed up with Church and Harvard's Derrick Rossi, who had recently co-founded a biotech, Moderna Therapeutics, that had broken records for investments . They started to explore forming a CRISPR company. \"We talked to all the VCs in the space,\" says Musunuru, now a cardiologist at the University of Pennsylvania. Along the way, they learned that Charpentier's team and Zhang and his colleagues at Broad were also doing the VC dog-and-pony show. \"It was clear that people had competing interests, even though the real issues didn't come out to public display until later,\" Musunuru says. \nSome scientists went their own way to make sure that they, and not the investors, would shape the companies, whereas others hoped to make more money by affiliating with this or that VC firm. \"They were thinking the next Genentech—hundreds of millions of dollars,\" says Cowan of some of the earlier players who decided against launching a company with him. And there were bruised relationships. \"It's been an incredible fight over credit,\" Sontheimer says. \"Everyone is trying to jockey themselves and minimize what others did.\" \nBy the end of 2013, Charpentier, Novak, Foy, and Cowan had joined forces in CRISPR Therapeutics. Zhang, Church, and Doudna helped co-found Editas Medicine, which was born out of Broad. Sontheimer, Marraffini (now at The Rockefeller University in New York City), Rossi, and Barrangou are all co-founders of Intellia Therapeutics. Other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies soon jumped in, paying steep licensing and collaboration fees to the CRISPR startups, as well as to Broad. \nThese companies stress that they have distinct development \"pipelines\" and business strategies. But there's a great deal of overlap: For example, CRISPR Therapeutics and Editas have both made sickle cell disease and Duchenne muscular dystrophy a priority, and Intellia and Editas both have programs targeting the liver disease α-1 antitrypsin deficiency and collaborations that focus on engineering T cells to fight cancer. \"At the 10,000-foot level they're all similar,\" Doudna says. Yet she is unconcerned about duplication. \"There's plenty of space in the gene-editing world for multiple entities.\" Charpentier notes that some redundancy is a good thing to solve tough biomedical problems. \"How many pharmaceutical industries and biotechs are working on the same thing?\" she asks. \n*As of 9 February 2017 (Table data) SEC S-1 Filings \nThe developing patent battle has led to further rifts. Doudna, Charpentier, and collaborators—who collectively are represented by UC—first filed a patent application in May 2012, whereas the Broad group did not file a patent claim until that December. But Broad, which soon filed 11 more patents to support its central claim that Zhang's team had invented the first CRISPR system to edit human cells, paid USPTO to fast-track the review of its applications. To the surprise of many in the field, USPTO began issuing CRISPR patents to Broad in April 2014 before deciding on the UC Regents' earlier patent application. \nChurch says he had serious misgivings about Broad's patent position and the legal wrangling, which Editas bankrolled. \"I almost quit,\" Church says. Broad's first patent application was rejected, he says, and Broad's response to USPTO—in particular, a declaration from Zhang—\"was quite unfriendly and it questioned Jennifer's veracity and authenticity.\" The declaration noted that Doudna acknowledged Church's help in her January 2013 publication about making CRISPR work in human cells. \"I just thought she was being nice, and holding that against her like she got vital information from me is odd.\" (Broad, Editas, and the other parties in the patent dispute refused to discuss the details.) \nDoudna left Editas a few weeks after the patent was granted. She says she had family commitments at home in Berkeley and was tired of traveling to Cambridge but adds, \"You're welcome to draw your own conclusions.\" A year later, she became a \"cofounder\" of Intellia—based in Cambridge. And at UC's behest, USPTO declared a patent \"interference\" on 11 January 2016, which triggered an expensive, contentious fight that the companies are financing. \nThe track record of earlier gene-editing approaches suggests that the CRISPR companies pursuing medical therapies have a long road ahead. In 2009, for example, Sangamo Therapeutics in Richmond, California, began using zinc finger nucleases to modify genes in immune cells from HIV-infected people, hoping to make the cells resistant to the virus. Yet the company still doesn't have an approved therapy. Similarly, cancer immunotherapies designed with TALENs by Cellectis, headquartered in Paris, have been tested in people since 2015, but they've only been given to two patients so far . \nThere's no reason to think CRISPR would succeed any faster in applications like those, says Dana Carroll at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, who did pioneering work to develop the zinc finger technology. \"If you have just one target you're going to hit over and over again and it's part of a big project, it doesn't matter which platform you use,\" Carroll says. \"CRISPR's a great advantage only when you're feeling your way, like you do in a research project.\" \nNor is it clear that CRISPR will offer an easier path to genetically modified crops and livestock than other genetic engineering techniques do . That will depend on whether government regulators exempt CRISPR-modified organisms, which are made without transfering DNA from one species to another, from the scrutiny that genetically modified organisms now get. \nUSPTO's appeal board is expected to announce its decision in the next few weeks. Sherkow and Contreras predict each party will likely wind up with some patent rights and will ultimately cross license. But the decision is sure to shake up the industry, Doudna says. \"It does raise this dilemma of what happens in the future with all of these various partnerships that have been put in place,\" she says. \"They will have to be re-evaluated.\" \nIn spite of the uncertainties, Barrangou, who notes that for a decade he was one of only a handful of researchers working on CRISPR, says people still underestimate how large CRISPR Inc. will become. \"We're not even getting started,\" he says. \"People say, ‘I can't wait for the bubble to burst.’ Talk to them 6 months later and they say, ‘I can't believe this.’ Talk to them 5 years later and they'll still say they can't believe it.\" Posted in:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T15:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:02:44.601+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
