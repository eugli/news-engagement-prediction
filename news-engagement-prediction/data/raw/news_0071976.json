The Darling was judged by Forbes as having virtually flawless service and outstanding facilities.\nThe Star hotels general manager John Autelitano said the award was a real coup not just for The Star but for Sydney as a whole.\n“This is the pinnacle of our industry,” he said. “Forbes have been doing this for quite some time and there are only about 140 Five Star hotels around the world.”\nRegarded as the world authority on luxury, the Forbes Travel Guide has been flying anonymous inspectors across the globe to assess ­hotels against a series of 800 objective standards since 1958.\nmedia_camera Forbes have judged the hotel as having virtually flawless service and outstanding facilities.
