Porsche 911s are terrific. However: Please use this video as an example of what not do when modding Doom   Uploading Doom to a car's computer via flash drive starts out perfectly fine. It requires setting your car to debug mode, and if you didn't know your car's computer even had a debug mode, then hey, you learned something. But this Porsche version of Doom calls on the driver/player to fire by honking your horn, swap guns by shifting gears, and change directors with the steering wheel. All that seems neat. But then, to move forward, you have to press the gas. Which means you have to actually drive to play Doom . Like, on the street. Hypothetically—if you had access to say, an airplane hangar—this would be a perfectly fine thing to do. YouTuber vexal goes into a parking garage, but come on. Just play Doom on your MacBook Pro bar . Or better yet, get your computer to play Doom for you while you go for a nice drive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:15:14.154+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
