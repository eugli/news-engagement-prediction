But the tensions come at a critical point in the war against IS, with two key battles in the works: the fight to take control of west Mosul, and the start of a campaign in Syria to oust IS from Raqqa, the capital of its self-declared caliphate. \nAl-Abadi has taken a measured approach, but the issues can roil already difficult internal politics. \nUnder the president’s deadline, Mattis has just a week to send Trump a strategy to accelerate the fight and defeat the Islamic State group. And any plan is likely to depend on US and coalition troops working with and through the local forces in both countries. \n“We’re going to make certain that we’ve got good situational awareness of what we face as we work together and fight alongside each other,” Mattis said. \nHis key goal during the visit is to speak about the military operations with political leaders and commanders on the ground, including his top commander in Iraq, Lt Gen Stephen Townsend.

The oil issue, however, may be more difficult. \nTrump brought it up during the campaign, and he mentioned it again late last month during a visit to the CIA. \n“To the victor belong the spoils,” Trump told members of the intelligence community. He said he first argued this case for “economic reasons,” but added it made sense as a counterterrorism approach to defeating IS “because that’s where they made their money in the first place.” tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T22:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T12:12:51.951+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
