Muhammad Ali leaves behind a legacy of thrilling fights, trash talk poetry and taking a stand against inequality and war. \nIt was the first time Mr Ali Jr and his mother have ever been asked if they are Muslim when re-entering the US, Mr Mancini said. \n\"From the way they were treated, from what was said to them, they can come up with no other rational explanation except they fell into a profiling program run by customs, which is designed to obtain information from anyone who says they're a Muslim,\" Mr Mancini said. \n\"It's quite clear that what triggered his detention was his Arabic name and his religion.\" \nUS Customs and Border Protection released a statement on Friday saying it could not discuss individual travellers, but did speak more broadly about inspections. \n\"All international travellers arriving in the US are subject to CBP inspection,\" The Courier-Journal's report about the detention said. \nAn airport spokesman referred questions to customs and border protection officials. \nDuring his detention, Mr Ali Jr was repeatedly asked about his lineage and his name, \"as if that was a pre-programmed question that was part of a profile,\" Mr Mancini said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:37:39.717+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
