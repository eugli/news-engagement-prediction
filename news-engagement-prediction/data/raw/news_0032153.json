I told him 'he's a liar',\" Ms Ting said. \n\"He stood up and he punched me.\" \nMs Ting told the court she started crying and locked herself in the bathroom. She overheard Radradra call a pastor and ask him to come the home. \nTranslating from Fijian, Ms Ting told the court that Radradra told the pastor: \"I used my hands on her\". \nThe pastor, the court heard, talked to the pair together and they read a Bible verse before he left. \nFive witnesses are expected to give evidence at the hearing.
