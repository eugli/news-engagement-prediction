The problem occurred six days after engineers discovered a growing hole in the dam's main, concrete spillway. \nOfficials defended the decision to suddenly call for mass evacuations Sunday, just a few hours after saying the situation was stable, forcing families to rush to pack up and get out. \n\"There was a lot of traffic. It was chaos,\" said Robert Brabant, an Oroville resident who evacuated with his wife, son, dogs and cats. \"It was a lot of accidents. It was like people weren't paying attention to other people.\" \nGov. Jerry Brown said Monday that he sent a letter to the White House requesting direct federal assistance in the emergency, though some federal agencies have been helping already. \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
