Sixty members of Knesset voted in favor of the law, whereas 52 opposed it. Erekat, who also serves a Fatah Central Committee member, called on the international community to hold Israel accountable for its action including that pertaining to settlements. “The international community has the responsibility to take concrete measures to protect the Palestinian people under Israel's military rule, rather than merely issuing statements,” Erekat stated. “It's long overdue to hold Israel accountable for its systematic violations of international law.”Nabil Abu Rudeinah, the spokesman of the Palestinian Authority presidency, told the PA’s state run news agency, Wafa, that the law is “unacceptable and condemned” and a violation of UN Security Council resolution 2334. UNSC 2334 said that the establishment of settlements “has no legal validity and constitute a flagrant violation under international law.”Fatah, the ruling party in the West Bank, said that the place to deal with the law is the ICC.The ICC Prosecutor-General Fatou Bensouda opened a preliminary examination into a number of issues including settlements in 2015, but has yet to decide if she wants to open an full investigation into them.Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the PLO Executive Committee, denounced the law, saying that it ends all hope for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.“Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his extremist government coalition are implementing dangerous and catastrophic measures to destroy the principle of the two state solution and the possibility of peace, and to force the ‘Greater Israel’ project on historic Palestine,” Ashrawi remarked, adding that the goal of such a project “is to prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state.”The law will likely come in front of the High Court of Justice in the near future as a number of Israeli non-governmental organizations have already committed to petition against its constitutionality.The court has historically ruled against the legalization of settlements on private Palestinian property.
