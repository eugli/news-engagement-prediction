The actor, unsurprisingly, seems to be over the moon. “We are really happy and really excited. It’s going to be an adventure,” Clooney said in an interview with French show Rencontres de Cinema this weekend, referring to himself and his wife, Amal . “We’ve sort of embraced it all . . . with arms wide open.” The actor was ostensibly there to talk about his work, as well as his upcoming honor at the César Awards. But the conversation couldn’t help but veer toward his more personal news. And while we had previously heard that George and Amal are reportedly having a boy and a girl , neither future parent had spoken publicly about the matter until now. Clooney also shared an anecdote about how the couple’s “very supportive” friends reacted to Amal’s pregnancy. “It got really quiet, and they all just started making baby crying noises. And the whole table just busted up laughing,” he said. With two babies on the way, the Clooneys will no doubt have loads more tears and laughter on their horizon.
