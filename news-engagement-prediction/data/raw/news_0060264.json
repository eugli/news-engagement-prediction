Yes Papa Penny, but what exactly are 'spiritual diamonds'? \nThe single, called Power of Gold , was released on Wednesday and topped the Twitter trends list from the moment it dropped. \nFifi also addressed her departure from Ambitiouz in the song, saying that the move meant she was no longer broke. \n\"Just because I ain't signed no more it doesn't mean sh*t. It doesn't mean that I can't go on. Matter of fact, it means that I ain't broke no more and follow rules man. Ain't gotta love no more,\" she rapped. \nShe also claimed that she had not seen her money from the label, and stood firm in her stance that nobody could \"buy\" her. \n\"Man release that dough. Super-producer I didn't even see that dough... Man, I'm somebody's mother man, somebody's sister, yeah. A re re nou (talk now) if it was your mother would you like that?... Shame, it's just funny how money can't buy me,\" Fifi added. Fifi Cooper thinks Emtee should have left Ambitiouz \nEarlier this week, Fifi told Trending SA that she was often made to feel like a fool when she approached Ambitiouz management to ask about royalties, percentages and contractual agreements. \n\"I was complaining because I have been there for two years. I am allowed to ask: 'where is my royalties?'\" she said on the show. \nTake a listen to the song.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T13:24:24.412+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
