Magazine last week – and it was also the first time he had seen the baby. News Group Newspapers Ltd 7 The model first saw his potential son on the cover of OK! Magazine \nHe smiled: “The baby is beautiful, he is perfect. But the first time I saw him was in a shop.” \nIt was a surreal and bittersweet moment for him, but Jeremy claims he had “prepared myself for that months ago.” \nHe added: “The child is beautiful I can see a resemblance to myself. But he looks more like my sister. \n“He looks like me and I want to be the father, but I just need that reassurance, just for myself.” \nJeremy, who was visibly moved as he spoke about Steph ‘s infant son, went on to claim that he hasn’t got a particular name he would prefer the tot to be called. \nHowever, he believes that if his ex of four months was so certain that the baby was his, she could have involved him somehow. 7 Steph and Jez’s four month relationship quickly turned toxic \nHe adds that having doubts about the baby’s paternity also could have meant she waited before deciding on a name. \nJeremy said: “I would certainly still – even if I begrudged someone so much or hated them like she says – I’d still have waited for the DNA test before deciding on a name. \n“I think if she was so positive that I was the dad she would have asked me to be involved in the decision.” \nHowever, Jeremy doesn’t dislike the unusual moniker , which is made partly of the charismatic stranger’s name and Steph’s beloved grandad’s. Stephanie Davis beams as she sees her son's face for the first time \nHe said: \"It rolls off the tongue... Cabes, Cab.\" \nJeremy also shared his sadness that if Caben-Albi is his son he won't share his surname - and he worries that he won't be named on the baby's birth certificate. \nHe said: \"She won't have put my name on the birth certificate. \n\"I want to do the paternity test and find out for sure I am the baby's father and then we can talk about stuff like that.\" OK Magazine 7 The first time Jeremy saw his potential son was on THIS magazine cover \nYesterday The Sun online revealed that Jeremy believes he IS the father of Steph's baby, and hopes that he is, too. \nAdmitting that he can see a resemblance between him and little Caben, he begged his former love to give him a DNA test so he can step up and be a good dad. \nExplaining that he \"flew home from Thailand the day the baby was born\", Jeremy is eager to be a positive influence and role model in Caben's life if the DNA test comes back positive. INSTAGRAM 7 Steph posted this picture of baby Caben on Tuesday night \nHe said: \"The baby is only a few weeks old, there is still time for me to bond with him and be the first person he ever falls in love with. \n\"I'm not a feckless father, it upsets me that people think me I'm that kind of man. \n\"I loved Steph very much, but our relationship had turned so toxic I had to walk away to protect her and her - our - unborn child.\" Getty Images 7 Steph maintained her glam image while pregnant with her son \nThe new mum and former Hollyoaks actor had previously been really vocal about how she would name her first born after her dead grandad, and at one point even toyed with giving him the middle name 'Patrick' as a homage to his Irish roots. \nHowever, after a few days in Jersey last summer she did a bit of a U-turn and revealed she was going to name the baby after a ‘random lad’ . \nBack in August, a few months after revealing she was pregnant via a promptly deleted comment on her ex's Instagram, Steph jetted off for a fun girls' holiday. \nWhile away, she explained how she met a man in a bar who would go on to play a HUGE role in her son's life - he would inspire his name. WENN 7 Jeremy says he was forced to walk away as their relationship had turned so toxic \nWriting in her OK! mag blog in August, she revealed: \"I've picked my boy's name! It's not Albi but that will definitely be a middle name. \n\"I'm going to keep it a secret for now but I will say it's something different – I've not heard it before! It's like a movie star name.
