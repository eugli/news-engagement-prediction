Neither are they cut from stones or trees, fished from lakes and rivers, or born of super human beings or wild animals. \nHeroes have lived before us and will live with and even after us because of their selflessness, including facing death let alone going to jail. \nAll earthly heroes and heroines are born of man and woman. The only difference between them and other mortals is that they are prepared to throw themselves under a moving train while fighting for the wretched of the earth and for what they believe is just and right for themselves and society. \nThe current officials of the doctors' union fall in this category, whether one likes it or not. \nFor the 50-plus years since Kenya attained independence, the country has struggled to define who our present, past and future heroes are. \nThe struggles the seven officials have waded through over the past two and a half months point to Kenyans how to define, select and honour heroes.
