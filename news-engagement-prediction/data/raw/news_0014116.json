The information, including the category, is passed on to a control centre whose staff prioritise patients and farm the jobs to the closest paramedic team. Red 1 is for patients who are not breathing or do not have a pulse, and the target response time is eight minutes. These calls get a Fast Response Unit – a single paramedic in a car – as well as an ambulance with a crew of two. Red 2 also has a target response time of eight minutes, and covers other life-threatening emergencies such as a stroke, heart attack, severe allergic reaction or seizures. Green 1 and 2 is serious but not life-threatening, such as a broken limb, overdose, serious injuries sustained in an assault or a heavy bleed. We’d still use blue lights and sirens and typically they get a response within 30 minutes. Response times are set locally. Green 3 and 4 are non-serious – less severe limb injuries, for instance. Target is about an hour. Paramedics aren’t told about an emergency until we are sent there, and we deal with one at a time. I can’t imagine the pressure dispatchers are under watching calls stacking up, and trying to get them out in order of priority. In the past few weeks there has been a torrent of bad news about the ‘chaos’ facing British ambulance services. Reading the horror stories, you would think that, stressed to breaking point, the wheels had finally come off. There was the 26-year-old waiting five hours to be attended to after suffering back injuries in a car crash; the pensioner who fell in the street in Dorset, breaking her hip, left for three hours before help arrived; the man aged 82 left on a freezing pavement for two hours in Weston-super-Mare as he waited for an ambulance after falling and smashing his pelvis. These stories are becoming an almost daily occurrence, and it’s a tragedy. But there is a hidden story. Yes, everyone should get a paramedic immediately. But there are not enough ambulances to go round. The fact that non-critical calls are made to wait as we target the high-priority, life-or-death cases first is a sign that, under immense pressure, the system is working. The recent National Audit Office report into the service found 10.7 million calls were made to ambulance services last year. That’s a 30 per cent rise in four years. Over the past few decades, London has seen the number of calls double, from about 2,500 to 5,000 a day. But although demand is rising, the number of paramedics and ambulances has not grown proportionately. Last month one newspaper claimed there were 745 paramedic vacancies and that recruits were being offered £10,000 bonuses to sign-up. Starting salaries are about £21,000, rising to £35,000 for a full-time senior like me. I’ve heard of even larger sums being offered and, despite this, it doesn’t surprise me that they can’t recruit. The job is backbreaking, literally. My back is ruined from years of lifting heavy patients in and out of chairs or beds and in and out of ambulances. It’s also gruelling. Night shifts are the worst. Typically, you do four in a row, sometimes more. You spend your days off recovering and you can be due back less than two full days later. And so burn-out is rife. It’s generally accepted a paramedic will last about five years before looking for something else. These days paramedics are graduates, and can work less hard and for more money in other areas of healthcare. Our anonymous source says burnout is rife and new recruits may be looking for work within a few years of starting. File image Hamster Bites and Drunks I have colleagues who blame ‘time-waster’ patients for the pressure on the system, but I don’t like that term. People don’t know who to call for medical help these days, and that isn’t their fault. One survey, a few years back, showed that one in five Britons had never heard of 111, the NHS helpline set up in 2010 to handle problems that are urgent but non-life-threatening. But everyone knows how to dial 999. It’s difficult to see a GP at short notice these days, let alone out of hours. Meanwhile, the number of district nurses has been slashed. There are 4,000 now across Britain, down from 13,000 in the late 1990s, meaning elderly people at home after operations or with chronic conditions are poorly managed. We’re at the sharp end, mopping up the cases where, if a patient had been properly cared for at home, they wouldn’t have become so unwell in the first place. Accident & Emergency departments get the really bizarre stuff – people coming in with stubbed toes, hamster bites and needing help to remove false nails. These kinds of ‘injuries’ do seem to get filtered away from us by the telephone ‘triage’ system – but we do still get called out to visit patients who just have a really bad cold. They have a virus, find that it doesn’t get better as quickly as they thought it would, then look online and panic. The calls get to us because people will be complaining of persistent vomiting, chest pain, breathing problems, or other red-flag symptoms. It’s impossible to know it’s not serious without seeing them. Then again, sometimes you can spend a whole shift dealing with drunks. Rapid Responses and Delays HEALTH COMMENT By Dr Ellie Cannon We can walk into Starbucks for a coffee, order a book on Amazon and do the weekly supermarket shop online via our mobiles to arrive by the time we get home at the end of the day. We get what we want, when we want, and without waiting. Except when it comes to our health. There seems to be an expectation that a doctor or paramedic should be on hand to sort out every ailment, even if it is midnight on a Saturday. No one has the time to be ill, and more than ever we expect there to be a quick fix for every symptom. I have lost count of the times I’ve been berated by a patient who can’t believe we can’t cure the common cold. Across the board in the NHS, professionals try to do their best but end up pushed to the limit by a lack of resources and an over-burdened system. Lack of morale is rife. With an ageing population and ever-more patients with chronic illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease, the entire NHS system is shuddering under the strain. It’s a paradox that today – given the access to medical information we have via the internet – we seem less able to cope alone with illness. Our grandparents would never have dared to call an ambulance or a doctor because they had a cold. After my lady on the steps, our next two callouts of the day were to attend old boys with breathing problems: high-priority emergencies. In such cases, we are on the scene within eight minutes. In this case a Fast Response Unit was already there when we arrived. We are able to assess and stabilise a patient like this within about 20 minutes. But then getting them packed up and ready to go into hospital can take a while. Getting to hospital takes time and handing over to the team there takes 15 minutes or so, meaning the whole thing can take an hour and a half. I’ll have the ambulance cleaned and ready for the next patient in under 15 minutes. And maybe I’ll have time to go to the loo. People think this job is just us rushing round with lights blaring, scooping up the injured and rushing them to hospital. But it’s not. Even so, being a paramedic is an amazing job if you are interested in people, problem-solving and caring. We’re a safety net and I’m proud to live in a country that provides this service to everyone, without prejudice. Pride... and Privatisation So what does the future hold? To be honest, I believe we’ll be sold off, contracted out, bit by bit. It’s already happening. Private companies cover non-emergency patient transport services – taking people to and from hospital. One major player is DHL, as in the parcel delivery company. The problem is, they aren’t manned by paramedics. We have been called out by these ambulance drivers because something has gone wrong with a patient. For now, when you call 999, you get NHS ambulances and paramedics. I know the system is struggling, but I still believe we are getting the right care to our most ill and vulnerable. We pride ourselves in doing the best for our patients, sometimes against all odds. I wonder if a private company, whose priority is profit, will feel the same.
