With both brothers sharing undefeated 11-0-0 amateur records, the Maloney twins are now looking to see if they can repeat their amateur-ranks success against fighters on the professional boxing circuit. \nThe twins say they got in to boxing at the age of 13 while trying to get fit in the offseason for footy. \n\"All the footy clubs were doing boxing in their preseason, so we thought we would give it a shot,\" says Andrew. \n\"We used to have a couple of sets of boxing gloves laying around, we used to chuck them on in the living room and go at it for 10 rounds.\" Twins do their homework on Filipino opponents \nBoth Andrew and Jason have bouts scheduled against Filipino opponents on the undercard for Green v Mundine. \nJason — who stands at 167cm (a little bit taller than his twin) and currently ranked 10th in the WBA super bantamweight division — will fight Marco Demecillo. \nAndrew, the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games flyweight gold medal winner, will be competing at bantamweight against Renoel Pael. \nIn preparation for their undercard bouts, the twins say they travelled to the Philippines to get a taste for what they might come up against on the biggest stage of their careers. \n\"We sparred with guys who have similar styles to the opponents we are facing,\" says Andrew. \n\"We have left no stone unturned and we are both feeling 100 per cent ready for Friday night.\" \nCoached by Brian Butler, the twins share a special bond. \n\"We have pretty much always done everything together being twins,\" says Jason. \n\"We went to the same school and had the same group of friends. We started boxing together, we generally fight together on the same shows so we are always training together.\" \nThe Maloney brothers have a special relationship with 'the Green Machine'. \n\"We met Danny around three years ago, he has taken us under his wing and really been a mentor for my brother and I,\" says Jason. \n\"This will be the third Green undercard that we have been a part of. He has always been really supportive. \n\"Danny is a four-time world champion and an absolute legend of a person. He has helped put Australian boxing back on the map, he is a credit to the sport.\" \nBoth Maloney brothers say they will be standing for Australia's national anthem.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T11:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T07:28:00.494+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
