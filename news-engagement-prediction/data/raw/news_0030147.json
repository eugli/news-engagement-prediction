In the meantime, the Chargers will play home games at the StubHub Center in Carson. \nIn December , the Chargers agreed to lease part of the Hive — a Costa Mesa office complex north of the 405 Freeway at 3333 Susan St. — to use as its headquarters and training and practice facility. The lease runs for 10 years, City Manager Tom Hatch said last month .

Our kids will be playing youth sports.\" \nThroughout the season, Telesco said, the Chargers will be at the Costa Mesa facility \"every day except for game day.\" Chargers Don Leach | Daily Pilot Costa Mesa Mayor Katrina Foley presents the key to the city to Los Angeles Chargers owner Dean Spanos as she welcomes the NFL team during a luncheon at the Center Club on Monday.
