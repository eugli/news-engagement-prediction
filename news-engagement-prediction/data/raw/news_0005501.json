Joshua Thomas \nPublished on Jan. 31, 2017 \nJan. 31, 2017 \nFormer Australian bowler Mitchell Johnson has joined Cameron White in slamming the selection of Queensland rookie Sam Heazlett for his surprise ODI debut against the Kiwis on Monday. \nMORE: Andre Russell handed one-year ban for doping violation | Key Kiwi out of second ODI \nJohnson, who was in hot form for the Perth Scorchers recently as they took out the Big Bash, unleashed on selectors after Heazlett managed just four runs. \n“I wasn’t too pleased on the selection. It’s out of nowhere and basically I don’t think he’s played a Shield game and I’m not even sure he’s played a one-day game for Queensland,\" Johnson told Fox Sports . \n“I don’t know what the selection is for. It’s based on something they might have seen in an under-19s tournament, but you’ve got to pick some experienced players in that situation and unfortunately they’re not doing it.\" \n“I think we just saw in that game in New Zealand, some of those experienced guys over there would’ve been a huge help.” \nJohnson was also quick to point out how selectors are ignoring players performing in the Sheffield Shield. \n\"The players themselves that are in the Shield competition and playing for their states, they’re probably sitting back wondering, ‘What do I have to do to play for Australia now’. Where’s the pattern? I don’t know. And from the players’ point of view that are playing in the Shield competition, they’ve got no idea as well what they need to do.” \nAustralia and Heazlett himself will be hoping for a better showing when their second ODI with New Zealand gets underway tomorrow in Napier.
