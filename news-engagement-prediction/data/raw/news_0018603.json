This time around she's not submitting to bondage, but calling the shots. Sort of. Why the masks? Maybe Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson have seen the \"Fifty Shades Darker\" reviews. (Photo: Doane Gregory) \nStory Highlights Critic's rating: 1.5 out of 5 stars 105   COMMENT EMAIL MORE Say what you want about “Fifty Shades Darker” — bemoan the lack of chemistry between the leads, the lack of artistry in the filmmaking, the lack of a plausible story. If nothing else, it leaves you with one burning question.\nNamely, how many of these “Fifty Shades of Grey” books are there? How many of these movies are they going to have to make?\nRELATED: More mayhem, thrills in 'John Wick: Chapter 2' | ‘Tanna’ is daring attempt at telling familiar tale | Fun never stops in 'The LEGO Batman Movie' \nOh. There are three. So one more movie, “Fifty Shades Free,” due in 2018. That’s a relief, relatively speaking.\nBut to the task at hand: This is a horrible movie. Which makes it not a lot different from the first film.\nAZCENTRAL\nThings To Do app: Get the best in events, dining and travel right on your device\nThis time around new director James Foley — whose credits include “Glengarry Glen Ross” — and screenwriter Niall Leonard (married to E.L. James, author of the novels) try to patch the plot holes by kinking up the sex, but it’s a lost cause.\nJamie Dornan returns as Christian Grey in \"Fifty Shades Darker.\"   (Photo: Doane Gregory) \nAs the film begins Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson), having waded into the bondage-and-submission pool with billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan), has decided it wasn’t for her, and neither is Christian. She’s got a new job at a publishing house, ready to move on with her life, which will seem like an increasingly good idea.\nBut it’s not long before Christian is back in the picture. Not so much because he is madly in love with her, though that’s what he claims, but because he is a full-on psychopathic stalker.\nNice apartment, though.\n  \nOK, so in his telling of things he is “complicated.” But he’s also creepy. He gives Ana, as he sometimes calls Anastasia, a check for $24,000. She tears it up, so he blithely calls his secretary and instructs her to deposit $24,000 in Ana’s account. She is understandably furious, and demands to know how he has access to her bank information.\nCut to the two of them laughing over brunch. In the very next shot. \nSo it goes for the remainder of the film, back and forth between disturbing control-freak behavior on his part, anger on hers and then, oh, what the heck, let’s head for the bedroom.\nElena (Kim Basinger) has taught Christian (Jamie Dornan) some big lessons in \"Fifty Shades Darker.\"   (Photo: Photo Credit: Doane Gregory) \nWhile it was Christian who wanted to get back together (renegotiate the terms, as he puts it), Ana insists that this time around she’s not going to submit to the submission, as it were. Later she asks him to spank her. Ah, but this time she’s the one making the rules, the one calling the shots. Or something. Honestly, the whole thing is so devoid of any identifiable emotion on the part of any of the characters, it’s hard to care one way or the other.\nTo fill time between the sex scenes, there are a few other things going on. Ana’s boss (Eric Johnson) is also a creep. Elena Lincoln (Kim Basinger), the older woman who led Christian down the path to dominance and submission, hangs around to make trouble. More dangerous still is Leila (Bella Heathcote), one of Christian’s former submissives.\nThe less said about the helicopter scene, the better. Although its conclusion was laugh-out-loud funny. Just not intentionally.\nIt’s all supposed to be darker, get it? Darkest of all, however, is the final scene, which, despite literal fireworks, promises the next sequel. Scary stuff, indeed.\nReach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontz@arizonarepublic.com. Facebook: facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.
