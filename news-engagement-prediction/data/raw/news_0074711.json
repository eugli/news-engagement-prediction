He was received by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak before being whisked away in a heavily guarded convoy for a state ceremony at Malaysia's parliament grounds. \nThe leader was greeted in parliament with a 21-gun salute, local media reported. \nKing Salman also plans to visit Indonesia, Brunei, Japan, China, the Maldives and Jordan \"to meet with the leaders of those countries to discuss bilateral relations and regional and international issues of common concern,\" a royal court statement carried on Saudi Arabia's state media SPA reported. \nGovernment sources with knowledge of the visit said a 600-strong delegation will accompany the king on his four-day visit to Malaysia, where cooperation on energy developments will be on the agenda. \nState oil firm Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) and Saudi Aramco will sign an agreement on Tuesday to collaborate in Malaysia's Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (Rapid) project, a boost for the Southeast Asian economy which has been reeling under weak global oil prices. \nEscalator and two personal cars \nRelations between the two countries have been in the spotlight over the last two years after Saudi Arabia was dragged into a multi-billion dollar corruption scandal at Malaysian state fund 1MDB, founded by Najib. \nNajib has denied any wrongdoing in the money-laundering case which is now being investigated by several countries including the US, Switzerland and Singapore. \nA Malaysian government inquiry found that nearly US$700 million transferred to the Prime Minister's bank account in 2013 was a donation from the Saudi royal family and most of it was returned. \nThe last time a Saudi king visited Malaysia was in 2006, when King Abdullah, King Salman's half-brother and predecessor, flew in with a 300-member delegation. \n\"Saudi Arabian investment in Malaysia is expected to create thousands of jobs and we are proud that Malaysian firms have been chosen to undertake projects at some of the most prestigious locations in Saudi Arabia,\" Najib said in a statement on Friday. \nBesides travelling with his own private escalator, King Salman has also flown in two personal cars. His entourage has also completely booked out three luxury hotels in Kuala Lumpur for the duration of the visit. \nAfter Malaysia, the King is expected to travel to Jakarta and Bali in Indonesia from March 1-9 with an even larger entourage of 1,500 people, followed by a trip to Japan from March 12 to 14, officials in those countries said. \nKing Salman is expected to spend the last two weeks of March on holiday in the Maldives, according to a Maldives diplomat. Local newspaper Mihaaru reported that three resorts have been reserved for his stay. \n- Reuters \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T12:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T08:42:19.237+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
