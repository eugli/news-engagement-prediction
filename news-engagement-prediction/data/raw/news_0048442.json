Some electors 'not supportive' of deal \nMs Evangel won the seat from Labor in the 2013 election. \n\"I'm a wog - and very proudly so - and am also proud to be an Australian,\" she said. \nBut with a slim 2.8 per cent margin, Ms Evangel is under pressure to hold on to the seat. \nHer main challenger is Vincent Mayor John Carey, who is running for Labor. There are no PHON candidates in the race for Perth. \nMs Evangel said some members of her electorate were not supportive of the deal. \n\"I just wanted to make it clear to my electorate and to everybody that just because this preference deal has been negotiated, it's not a reflection of my values and what I stand for because I certainly don't have anything in common with the values and policies of One Nation,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T16:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:26:19.616+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
