Airport CCTV footage may reveal assassination \nAllegedly, this is the footage of the assassination of Kim Jong Nam, the half-brother of North Korea's dictator. The leaked CCTV footage appears to show a woman spray a liquid on Kim Jong-nam’s face as he stands in a crowded concourse at Kuala Lumpur Airport. The blurry footage shows Kim Jong-nam, dressed in a grey jacket and dark blue top, being circled by at least two women just moments before the attack was carried out. A woman in a white top reaches her arm around Jong-nam’s face before spraying him with a liquid, Malaysia Kini reported. The woman then calmly, but quickly, walks away.
