Drowning statistics: July 2015-2016 280 people drowned in Australian waterways 83 per cent of drownings were male, 17 per cent were female New South Wales recorded the highest number of drowning deaths with 96 The most drowning deaths occurred in January 21 children aged between 0-4 years drowned in Australian waterways Source: Royal Life Saving National Drowning Report 2016 \nThe attention has raised questions over the style of teaching and whether it is harmful. \nMs Beesley said once children learnt the skills required, they calmed down and enjoyed their time in the water. \nBut from the start, there is a direct focus on survival, whereas other swim schools may provide a gentler, assisted introduction to water safety. \n\"Most swimming lessons for young children are water awareness or water familiarisation where a parent gets in the water with a child, does exploration, plays games and sings songs, but it doesn't give them any skill or competency in the water,\" Ms Beesley said. \n\"It's not teaching the child to become the aquatic problem-solver, and most kids who are drowning are under four. \n\"They're the kids that need to be taught not just how to sing a nursery rhyme in the water, but how to become skilled and competent. \n\"It targets children most at risk of drowning by giving them skills where, if an accident was to happen, they can save themselves.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:58:26.260+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
