The engagement between Kate Middleton and Prince William was a fairytale, the whole world instantly fell in love with the future Duchess of Cambridge, and women everywhere wanted to buy clothes just like the clothes Middleton wore. Just realized my homecoming dress matches my replica of Kate Middleton's engagement ring so yeah pretty excited about that. \n— Haley☾ (@haleyybug_) September 23, 2013 \nAccording to People magazine, the dream turned into a nightmare for Kate’s chosen engagement dress designer, Daniella Helayel. It wasn’t a problem with Middleton’s choice or with Helayel’s design skills. \nMiddleton’s sapphire blue, wrapped engagement dress was absolutely gorgeous and “perfectly matched” Kate’s 12-carat sapphire engagement ring — the same ring that Prince Charles gave to Lady Diana Spencer.

Diana wore a two piece suit in the same rich shade of blue for her engagement photo, a blue that also matched the sapphire-and-diamond engagement ring. That was so touching of Prince William to bestow her mom's engagement ring to Kate Middleton. What can be more romantic than that? \n— Chrysanthemum (@melybloom) November 17, 2010 \nKate’s iconic engagement dress was immediately all the rage, and the dress flew off the shelves. The Independent reports that although that kind of instant popularity that Middleton brought would normally be seen as good for business, Helayel says all the publicity “ruined her life.” \nThe moment that Kate chose the sapphire dress to wear as a backdrop for her engagement ring was the moment that “everything changed” for the designer. \nThe Daily Mail writes about an interview Middleton’s engagement dress designer did with the outlet’s fashion and beauty themed You magazine. \nAt first, the news seemed to be very good for Issa. Sales rocketed upwards after Kate and Prince William’s engagement photo “set phones ringing.” The dress “sold out in five minutes,” and thousands of orders for Middleton look-alike outfits poured in. But reality quickly set in for the small design house. \nIssa had been completely unprepared for the sudden success because no one at the company knew ahead of time that Middleton intended to wear that dress for her engagement announcement. If they’d known, they could have planned to have more of the dresses available and materials ready for future orders. \nBut even with preparation, Helayal says they would have faced difficulties. The situation was unprecedented. Nothing they’d experienced from the already growing “Kate effect” was anything like the extraordinary demand for the blue engagement dress. \nThe romance and fairytale quality of Kate and Prince William’s engagement was exactly what a recession-weary world was waiting for. \n“When Kate wore that dress everything changed.” \nSales doubled instantly after Middleton’s engagement announcement, but more sales required more materials upfront, and Helayel says she “didn’t have the money to finance production on that scale. The bank refused to give me credit and the factory was screaming for me to pay its bills.” \nThe situation went from bad to worse for the dress designer. Eventually, she found her investor, but it was someone connected to the royal family, and that led to further troubles. Dodi Al-Fayed “died in a car crash with Princess Diana in 1997.” \nHis sister, Camilla Al-Fayed, stepped in all those years later to help the designer who made the engagement dress for Middleton, but the Al-Fayed family were not impressed. \nThey’d already been outspoken and “extremely critical” of the royal family ever since Diana died. Middleton slowly switched allegiance from Issa, wore fewer of the dresses. Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge in 2012. Middleton soon stopped wearing Issa dresses.

Helayel “clashed with” the person now in charge of bringing Issa out of its financial crises that began with Middleton’s engagement. \nAt the same time, a new CEO was hired, and Helayel “clashed with” the person now in charge of bringing Issa out of its financial crises that began with Middleton’s outfit. \nEventually, Helayel left, and shortly afterward, Issa shut down. The sad truth is that the so-called Kate effect is powerful, and Middleton’s actions don’t always bring about change for the better. \nWhat do you think? Should Middleton be more aware of her choices since all her actions can have such a far-reaching effect? \n[Featured Image by Chris Jackson/Getty Images]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:05:53.257+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
