Germany is banning the doll over privacy fears. Credit Rob Stothard/Getty Images Cayla is a blond, bright-eyed doll that chatters about horses and hobbies. She plays games and accurately answers questions about the world at large. She could also be eavesdropping on your child. That’s the stark warning parents in Germany received on Friday from the country’s telecoms watchdog, the Federal Network Agency , which said hackers could use the doll to steal personal data by recording private conversations over an insecure Bluetooth connection. The watchdog said it was pulling the doll off store shelves and banning them in Germany. “Objects that have concealed cameras or microphones that can send information endanger the private sphere,” said Jochen Homann, the agency’s president. “The Cayla doll is forbidden in Germany,” he added, citing a German telecommunications law. Mr. Homann encouraged parents to deactivate the doll, which is manufactured by United States-based Genesis Toys and distributed by the Vivid Toy group. “This is also about protecting the rights of the weakest in society,” he said. The announcement reflects the growing concerns over “smart” products in the home that can get, well, too smart. A string of reports in recent years about hackers targeting and remotely controlling items like baby monitors have sounded the alarm. Meanwhile, numerous experiments by researchers have shown how easy it is to hack into cars, medical devices and even dolls. Germans are particularly sensitive to questions of privacy and data collection because of their experiences under the Nazi and Communist regimes, when releasing personal details could be a matter of life and death. The nation has some of the strongest data-protection laws in the world, and it considers an individual’s right to privacy to be far more important than any perceived public right to know.
