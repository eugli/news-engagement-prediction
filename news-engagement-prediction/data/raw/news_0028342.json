Dr Samuel Smith from Cancer Research UK said: ‘It’s clear more needs to be done to promote the guidance associated with these drugs, particularly as research reveals GPs are lacking the support to discuss effectively the risks and benefits of preventive therapy. PILLS BEING SHUNNED Tamoxifen was developed to treat breast cancer and has been prescribed since the 1990s. But scientists have since discovered high-risk women who take it for five years are 40 per cent less likely to develop breast cancer. Health watchdog NICE has told GPs to prescribe it to all women considered to be at moderate to high risk. Aspirin taken daily has been shown to slash the risk of bowel cancer by up to 20 per cent. But because the pills can cause stomach bleeds, experts have never advised that all high-risk patients take them. However, they are still meant to be prescribed for sufferers of Lynch syndrome – which produces polyps that can lead to bowel cancer. ‘Cancer-preventing drugs can potentially have a huge impact by reducing the risk of cancer developing in the first place. This report reveals that it’s vital GPs are given the right support and information so they are confident to explore the value of these drugs with those who would benefit from them, wherever they are in the UK.’ Experts believe only a handful of patients are taking either tamoxifen or aspirin to prevent cancer. Tamoxifen works by blocking out the cancer-triggering hormone oestrogen, which stops tumours growing in the first place. Research has shown taking it for five years can reduce the risk of breast cancer by 40 per cent. But the research found just 52 per cent of GPs were aware of tamoxifen’s benefits while only 24 per cent knew of the guidelines. Baroness Delyth Morgan, chief executive at Breast Cancer Now, said: ‘It is extremely concerning that many women at an increased risk of breast cancer are still not being offered the choice of taking tamoxifen to reduce their risk.’ The Daily Mail first reported the early findings of this study in November when it was presented at the National Cancer Research Institute Conference in Liverpool. It is published today in the British Journal of General Practice alongside the research on aspirin and bowel cancer. Professor Arnie Purushotham, senior clinical advisor at Cancer Research UK, said: ‘It’s vital GPs are given the right support so they are confident to explore the value of these drugs. It’s essential the NHS provides a clear steer to doctors to ensure all patients have equal access to treatments that could benefit them.’ One investigation found that half of local doctors did not know they should be prescribing the 6p-a-day drug tamoxifen to women at high-risk of breast cancer Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said: ‘The benefits of using long term medication to lower the risk of developing cancer are becoming clearer as new research findings become available – and it’s important that this informs official clinical guidelines, and that GPs and our teams are aware of them. ‘But with clinical guidelines rightly being updated so frequently and given the incredibly broad spectrum of knowledge GPs need to have, it’s understandable that family doctors often take cues from our specialist colleagues in hospitals – so improved communication channels between primary and secondary care would certainly be helpful.’ Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T08:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:11:56.128+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
