Now, it appears that lash enhancement tattoos are the next beauty treatment on the rise. That’s right, eyelash tattoos are a thing, and while the thought of a needle going anywhere near our eye lids sounds anything but pleasant, the results are truly interesting. As you might've guessed, this treatment involves tattooing a light black line of ink across the lashline, think of it as a light permanent eyeliner but with a more natural finish. According to Marie Claire , Piret Aava (aka The Eyebrow Doctor) has been at the forefront of this procedure, using advanced micropigmentation technology. To create the lash enhancement tattoos she uses a European tool called the Nouveau Contour which uses a light needle. \"The area is numbed first, and then thin liner is tattooed right in the lash line\", she told told Marie Claire . \"You fill in between the lashes to create the illusion of thicker, darker, and completely full lashes without looking lined or like obvious makeup.\" Similar to microblading, this treatment endures a 4-6 week touch-up period after the initial two-step process. However, once your touch-ups are done the results last up to 3-5 years, which is a pretty high pay off if you ask us. The tattoos can be added to your top or lower lashline, or both, so either way the tattoos add an instant noticeable definition to your eyes.
