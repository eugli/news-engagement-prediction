Bowe Bergdahl will try Monday to convince a judge that he cannot get a fair trial on charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy because of highly charged statements made by President Donald Trump.\nThe pretrial hearing before a military judge at Fort Bragg is expected to focus on statements that Trump made during the presidential campaign.\nBergdahl is scheduled for trial in April and could face a life sentence if convicted of misbehavior before the enemy. He is accused of endangering the lives of soldiers who searched for him after he walked off his post in Afghanistan in 2009.\nDefense attorneys argue that Trump violated Bergdahl's due process rights by repeatedly calling him a \"traitor\" and making other harsh statements about the soldier. The defense motion, filed shortly after Trump was sworn in as president, cites more than 40 instances of Trump's criticism at public appearances and media interviews through August 2016.\n© The Associated Press FILE - In this Jan. 12, 2016, file photo, Army Sgt.

The Obama administration's decision in May 2014 to exchange Bergdahl for five Taliban prisoners prompted some Republicans to accuse Obama of jeopardizing the nation's safety.\n___\nFollow Jonathan Drew at www.twitter.com/jonldrew\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBkyxle.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Trump", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA9UODq.img", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmT58k%3focid%3dst&text=Trump+Criticism+Of+Bergdahl+Expected+To+Lead+Defense&original_referer=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmT58k%3focid%3dst", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;DomainId&quot;:", "http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/c8795dd0-67e2-4cc4-bff7-0fc9e8ded44d/8eff6a36-1697-4a8b-9fe9-9869d8ffc4a8.ism/manifest(format=m3u8-aapl)&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;}", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmT58k?blobrefkey=en-us&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;culture&quot;:&quot;en-us&quot;}", "https://web.skype.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmT58k&lang=en-us&flow_id=d9f01456-e65b-4114-8ed5-89d4cd22d48a", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmT58k?blobrefkey=102&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;640&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;360&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;103&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmT58k?blobrefkey=103&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;1024&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;576&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;1004&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/c8795dd0-", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmTcni.img&quot;}}", "http://api.wochit.com/api/?partnerID=f421a246974545c6e1fb724595053584efa8cc05492e9685c8c2ea4e90f3768d&action=MRSS&topicName=General&descendants=true&quot;}", "https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmT58k%3focid%3dsl&title=Trump+Criticism+Of+Bergdahl+Expected+To+Lead+Defense&source=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmT58k%3focid%3dsl", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBurRAt.img", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmT58k?blobrefkey=1001&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;104&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmT58k?blobrefkey=104&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;1280&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;720&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;101&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp"], "published": "2017-02-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T21:54:59.412+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
