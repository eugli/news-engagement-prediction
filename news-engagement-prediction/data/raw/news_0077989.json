Two other cement firms were wrongly exempted from production suspensions. \nOn Friday, the MEP criticised several cities in Hebei, Shanxi and Henan for not doing enough in curbing the use of \"scattered coal,\" coal burned by households or small factories for heating and is much more dirty than that used by thermal plants, which have the equipment to reduce emissions. \nChina is intensifying efforts to fight pollution and environmental degradation after decades of growth left the country saddled with problems such as smog and contaminated soil. \nA total of 720 people were detained and 6,454 held accountable in China for environment-related wrongdoing in 2016, official data had said. \nChinese cities suffered from more days of air pollution in January, with northern areas being the worst affected. \nThe share of days with good air quality in BTH were a mere 36.2 percent in January, a year-on-year drop of 19.6 percentage points. \n(With PTI inputs) First Published: Sunday, February 26, 2017 - 23:20 More from zeenews", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T03:01:48.273+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
