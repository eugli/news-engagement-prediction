Most Popular By Kyle Mizokami Jan 30, 2017 According to CNBC, Donald Trump has announced a dramatic $600 million savings in the troubled F-35 program. This follows negotiations between the president and F-35 manufacturer Lockheed Martin, as well as Trump's pre-inauguration tweets criticizing the program's budget. However, there's evidence Trump may actually be taking credit for cost cuts that were going to happen anyway. The F-35 program is currently in a part of its development called Low Rate Initial Production, or LRIP. That means the government is buying F-35s in smaller numbers until the plane clears all developmental and operational testing. LRIP 9 was just concluded last year, and the LRIP 10 stage is next.   LRIP 10 consists of 90 new airplanes : 76 F-35A models for the U.S. Air Force and allied countries, 12 F-35B vertical-takeoff-and-landing models for the U.S. Marine Corps, and 2 F-35C carrier-borne versions for the U.S. Navy. We know that the previous stage, LRIP 9, priced the F-35A at $102.1 million each, the F-35B at $131.6 million each, and the F-35C at $132.2 million apiece. Using those numbers, LRIP 10 should cost a total of $9.5 billion. Most Popular Air Force General Chris Bogdan, who heads the F-35 Joint Program Office, predicted late in 2016 that F-35 prices would drop by \"6-7 percent\" between LRIP 9 and LRIP 10. It makes sense: The F-35 is gradually becoming cheaper as Lockheed Martin discovers more efficient construction techniques and takes advantages of economies of scale, wherein the manufacturer can negotiate better deals for more materials, labor, and overhead. A 6 percent cost reduction would amount to $570 million shaved off that $9.5 billion total, while a 7 percent reduction is $665 million. As such, Trump's claimed $600 million cut is right in the ballpark of what the price reduction was going to be all along. General Bogdan's prediction is less than two months old, and there's been nothing, for better or for worse, that would impact his forecast. Trump claims he got involved in the F-35 program \" about a month ago \" and that there was \"no movement\". Lockheed Martin CEO Marilyn Hewson visited the White House on January 23. The president has not disclosed the details of his deal with Lockheed Martin and how the two reached the $600 million dollar savings figure. It is unlikely that the planes in this new development stage are suddenly 12 to13 percent cheaper, which is what would have to happen for Trump to have achieved an additional $600 million savings over Bogdan's forecasted price cut, so perhaps Trump is personally taking credit for cost reductions that were going to happen all along. \"I appreciate Lockheed Martin for being responsive and that will be appreciated,\" FlightGlobal quoted the president as saying.
