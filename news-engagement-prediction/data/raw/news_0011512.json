The thieves entered the facility through a security-manned gate, connected their truck to a trailer that was holding the engines, and drove out, the Birmingham Mail writes. The whole event took place in just six minutes.\nIt is believed that the same truck came back later in the night, hooked up to another trailer filled with engines, and made off with more valuable car parts.\nFactory employees were \"stunned\" by the heist. \"The whole place is in uproar about it,\" a source said to Birmingham Mail.\n\"We can confirm that we are working closely with West Midlands Police to investigate the theft of engines from the Solihull manufacturing plant,\" a JLR spokespersons said. \"A reward is on offer to anyone who has information which leads to the successful recovery of these engines.\"\nFollowing the heist, police were able to locate the stolen trailers, but are still looking for the motors and the thieves.\nAny information on the whereabouts of the engines or those involved in the thefts should be reported to Solihull police,\" the JLR spokesperson said.\nFollow MSN Autos on Facebook and Twitter\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MSNAutos", "http://www.facebook.com/MSNAutos"], "published": "2017-02-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T04:01:24.473+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
