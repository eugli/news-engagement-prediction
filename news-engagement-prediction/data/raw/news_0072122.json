(Johnny Diaz) \nHe said he got the idea for the app after hearing friends and colleagues in the boating community complain about the challenges of meeting people through dating apps. When he shared the idea with his girlfriend, she connected him with Rizo. \n“When Nolan first told me about the idea, I thought it was a great idea for combining social networking and ocean conservation,’’ said Rizo, 37. \nTo develop the app, the men worked with a web design team in Barcelona. The app, for people age 18 and older, is free for Android and iPhone devices. Users can browse profiles detailing a person’s hobbies such as surfing, boating, fishing or just laying on the beach. They can comment on the person’s page, or send him or her a private message. The app is location-based and alert users when others are nearby. \nSwipe right and see which beach- or water-related events are happening locally, such as a volleyball game in South Beach. \n“The idea is for us as a brand to make some events but also have user-generated events. For example, you like to paddleboard, maybe you can make an event and have everyone meet on a Saturday at 9 a.m.,’’ Rizo said. \nIn just three weeks, about 800 people have signed up for the app, according to the founders. \nOne of the app’s users is John Van Dellen, a private yacht captain in West Palm Beach. He has used the app to learn of local events such as a release of loggerhead turtles in Juno Beach. \n“There is so much social media out there these days, and I just love that it was geared toward my lifestyle,’’ said Van Dellen, 37, who is married with three children. “I go on there and look at what’s going on. I love the heart that’s behind it. It was founded by a guy who works on the water every day.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:06:50.827+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
