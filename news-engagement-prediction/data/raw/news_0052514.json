Think again. \nLeonardo Jardim's side aren't top of the pops in France by chance. No, theirs is a squad stuffed full of young talent, from barrelling full-back Benjamin Mendy and midfield powerhouse Tiemoue Bakayoko to quicksilver winger Thomas Lemar and Bernardo Silva, a playmaker every bit as subtle as his Manchester City namesake. Mbappe has been making huge strides this season (Photo: Getty Images) \nThen there's Kylian Mbappe, the 18-year-old tipped to become one of Europe's best forwards in the years ahead. Capable of playing wide or through the middle, he has had a breakout season in Ligue 1, leading to inevitable comparisons to Thierry Henry and talk of a possible move to Arsenal this summer. \nHe'll likely start on the bench on Tuesday, but look out for him if he's called upon in the second half. Little Pea back in business Chicharito may find chances at a premium against Atletico (Photo: Simon Hofmann) \nIt has been a funny old season for Javier Hernandez. The Mexican started the campaign in commanding fashion, scoring seven times in his first eight games, but that was followed by a barren spell that lasted for almost four months. \nIt was an unusual drought for a player who has built a career on being in the right place at the right time, and coincided with a worrying spell of form for Bayer Leverkusen. \nHe got back on the horse at the end of January, bundling home in his side's 3-2 defeat to Borussia Monchengladbach, and has since been playing like a man who has had a weight lifted off his shoulders: he bagged a brace in the win over Eintracht Frankfurt and repeated the trick at Augsburg last Friday. \nOnce upon a time, even the most potent striker would be dreading a meeting with Atletico Madrid, but some of the defensive solidity that has defined Diego Simeone's side over the last few seasons has begun to slip away: the Rojiblancos have kept just two clean sheets in eight matches. If there's one man who can take advantage, it's Chicharito. Read More Gala night for old hands Casillas will be between the sticks for Porto, facing a familiar foe (Photo: Getty) \nTwo of the grand old titans of the goalkeeping profession meet when Porto host Juventus on Wednesday night. Iker Casillas and Gianluigi Buffon have 74 years and a whopping 275 Champions League appearances between them, yet both are still going strong for their respective clubs. \nCasillas has put a shaky start to life in Portugal behind him, helping the Dragons tighten up at the back this term and spreading calm from the back. He has admitted that there is a special pleasure in meeting his Juventus counterpart, who has been a pillar of consistency for so many years. Juventus and Italy legend Buffon (Photo: 2017 Getty Images) \n\"As I grew up, I looked up to him and then we evolved together and we've had similar careers,\" the Spaniard told UEFA.com. \"Ours is a healthy, positive rivalry: we really appreciate each other and playing against him is always a pleasure. He is a player who is known and admired all over the world and he is part of the history of this game.\" \nThe pair have met 17 times for club and Casillas just shades the head-to-head at present. But Buffon and the Old Lady are favourites to progress over two legs. Familiar faces looking to derail Leicester Nasri has been in fine form for Sevilla (Photo: Getty) \nIf Leicester's Champions League group games had an air of side-project adventure about them, their last-16 tie with Sevilla looks more like a refuge from the day-to-day drudgery of their domestic form. 2017 has been miserable for the Foxes, who have not scored in five Premier League matches and were bundled out of the FA Cup by Millwall at the weekend. \nThe bright lights of Europe have coaxed some sparky displays from Claudio Ranieri's charges, but they face their toughest challenge yet on Wednesday night. Inspired by wild-eyed former Chile coach Jorge Sampaoli, Sevilla are sitting pretty in third in La Liga and will be targeting a fourth successive continental crown after a hat-trick of Europa League titles. Sampaoli has been doing a fine job in Seville (Photo: 2017 Getty Images) \nSampaoli's squad is full of talent, but arguably the three key cogs at present are all former Premier League players. Steven N'Zonzi and Samir Nasri have been excellent all season, the former a towering presence in midfield and his compatriot enjoying his best season in years. They were joined in January by Stevan Jovetic, who scored three goals in his first four games – two against Real Madrid – and looks a man reborn. \nAll three will be relishing the meeting with the English champions. Better the devil you know? Leicester must hope so. Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T10:21:48.437+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
