It will be the imagine [sic] of him being taking down to the ground last night in the same arena he gave his all 2 as a player by the guards! This Could happen to any of us!!! #StayWoke We are not above this treatment! \nWade’s message came after LeBron James’s simple two-word Instagram post seemed to indicate he was throwing his support behind Oakley. \nThe takeaway here? For one, players have each other’s backs, especially one who played the way Oakley did for the Knicks . \nBut Wade’s post also seems to be pointed at fellow players (“This could happen to any of us!”) — it’s possible one of them could be in Oakley’s position in the not-to-distant future. They could be a star one minute, then pushed aside by ownership the next. \nA powerful take, isn’t it? More NBA!
