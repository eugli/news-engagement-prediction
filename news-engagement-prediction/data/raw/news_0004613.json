South Africa has its very own little fashionistas. One of those cuties is Mila, daughter of Tamlyn Jacobus . \nJacobus is a blogger ( Painting in Pink ), designer, photographer and, most important, wife and mother. \nWhen little Mila’s style caught my eye, I spoke to Tamlyn about what inspired her style... \nTell us a bit about Mila? \nMoo, my nickname for Mila, is three years old and a complete free spirit who enjoys painting, playing, reading and dancing. \nAs a mom of two girls, I know it can be fun to play “dress up” with your baby girl. When Mila was an infant, did you dress her up as well? \nAs an infant, Mila’s wardrobe resembled that of a ninja. Matching her with what I was wearing was a breeze, as well as switching up her outfit of the day. \nDoes Mila have any decision on what she wears? \nWe involve her as much as possible when it comes to personal choice and freedom of expression. I take her shopping with me and ask her what she likes and what she wants. We suggest what we think would look nice or be practical for her to wear. However, what she decides to walk out of the house in is entirely her decision. \nDo you have a specific style that you like for her? \nMy favourite trend to dress Mila in is boho. I love how free, flowy and pretty it is. However, tomboy is a close second. \nThere’s often a misconception that parents of stylishly dressed toddlers are spending a fortune on clothes. Is that the case with Mila? \nMila is an only child so there’s no need to skimp. However, shopping at stores like Gucci is not on the cards. One thing that I don’t do is compromise when it comes to footwear, but you won’t see me turn my nose up at shopping at affordable brands and stores. \nDo you ever get negative comments from people because of how you dress her? \nI don’t get negative comments. People have opinions but it doesn’t interest me because I pay for her clothing, not them. I don’t believe that girls need to be confined to pink clothing, skirts and dresses. I love dressing Mila in ripped jeans, black tutus, bomber jackets, boots and anything monochrome. \nHow do you feel about those parents who dress their little ones like mini-adults? \nDressing kids like mini-adults doesn’t phase me. Mila wore a blazer at three months, so I’m in favour of tiny humans looking dapper. \nWhere is your favourite place to shop for her? \nMy favourite places to shop for Mila are Cotton On Kids and Earth Child. \nAny advice for moms on dressing their toddlers? \nDress you child for the playground, not for Instagram.
