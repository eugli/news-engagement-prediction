There's one in each of the utes that operate on the property, there is one in each of the trucks,\" Mr Hannifey said. Trucking industry concerned about notification \nA key trucking industry association was concerned about a lack of communication from the authority. \nThe president of the National Road Freighters Association, Tony Hopkins, runs a large firm in Queensland involving 50 trucks. \nHe said he only became aware of the issue a couple of weeks ago and he advised his members then. \n\"We got a response from a lot of the [trucking] community,\" he said. \n\"They were outraged and couldn't believe something like this was happening.\" \nIt would have cost Mr Hopkins' company $40,000 to buy new communications equipment and he said he could not substantiate the need. \n\"The bottom 40 of an 80 channel radio is exactly the same,\" he said. \nMr Hopkins said making 40 channel UHF radios illegal was done without consultation with his industry, but Mr Byrne from ACMA said there had been consultation over a long period. \n\"This is the product of a review we conducted some years ago and there was an extensive consultation process leading up to these changes in 2011,\" he said. \n\"We've also made a statement on our website.\" \nWhile the freight association said it was not happy with the process, it said it was pleased that 40 channel UHF radios will continue to be legal past June 30.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T08:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T09:32:48.142+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
