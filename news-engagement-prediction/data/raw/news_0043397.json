Texas, Maryland and Oregon State were the other two seeds. The Longhorns made the biggest move, climbing five places since the previous reveal on Feb. 6. \nFlorida State, Stanford, Duke and Washington would be the three seeds. The Cardinal can't host because of a previous commitment at their home arena. \nUCLA, Louisville, Kentucky and Oklahoma would be the four seeds. \nSelection Monday is on March 13 and the NCAA Tournament begins that weekend. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.
