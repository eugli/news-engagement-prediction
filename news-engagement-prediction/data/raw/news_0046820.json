He mentioned an offensive racial term among the examples of the vulgar language used. \nPolice say they are investigating whether to pursue other charges against the men. Croatia, like other European countries, has seen a rise in far-right sentiments. \nFoxx was in Dubrovnik, a city on the Adriatic Sea, filming Robin Hood: Origins , in which he plays Little John. The Lionsgate retelling of English folklore stars Taron Egerton as the titular thief. Otto Bathurst is directing the action film, also starring Tim Minchin, Eve Hewson, Jamie Dornan and Ben Mendelsohn.
