Article continues below \nBurnley would come away with a very credible point against Chelsea at Turf Moor that showcased exactly why the Clarets own the fourth-best home record in the top-flight. \nIn fact, 28 of their 29 points in the league have come at home. Article continues below Former Barcelona chief reveals the one big problem Ibrahimovic and Messi had \nStill, there was no need for what Smith said about Chelsea after the game! \nOf course, we're joking and it was a simple mistake by the former Arsenal forward, a slip-up that the presenter David Jones and guest Chris Coleman tried their best to mask, but to no avail. \nAs you can see in the video below, when reflecting on Burnley's achievements in gaining a point from the league leaders, Smith gets tongue-tied and labels Chelsea, very briefly, a “c***” team.\" \nNaturally, fans have been ridiculing the former England international for his spectacular gaff. \n\"@9smudge knows:joy::clap: this is not a error it's just actually what smithy thinks lol,\" one user posted. \n\"Alan Smith calling Chelsea a c*** is how I feel on a Monday morning,\" another user humorously tweeted. \nThe actual line Smith uses says Burnley went \"toe-to-toe with the best c****\" and one can only assume that he meant club. \nRegardless, Twitter still had fun with it. \n\"Alan Smith is right, Chelsea are the best c****.\" \nChelsea are now 10 points clear of the chasing pack with just 13 games remaining in the 2016-17 campaign. Are they really going to drop that many points while their rivals produce spotless records? \nIt seems highly unlikely. But, then again, I would have said Smith calling Chelsea c**** was extremely unlikely too. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
