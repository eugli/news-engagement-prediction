May the Lord have mercy on your soul.” \nThe judge ruled that prosecution had established the ingredients necessary to secure a murder conviction, adding “the defendant from the facts of the case did not set out to kill the deceased, but he must have known that the machete wound he inflicted caused a grievous bodily harm. \n“The defendant left the scene of the fight to fetch a machete. That action was a proof of his intent to inflict the maximum injury on the deceased.” \nAdebiyi faulted the claim of self-defence claimed by Samuel during his trial.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T11:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T09:28:11.633+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
