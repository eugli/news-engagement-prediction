But will the winning players partake in the customary visit to the White House after? \nFOX’s Chris Hoenig reports: \nHe doesn’t want to get too far ahead of things: \n(Bennett) “All I know is I gotta win a Super Bowl.” \nBut New England Patriots tight end Martellus Bennett says he would not cap a Super Bowl championship with a visit to the White House: \n(Bennett) “I don’t support the guy that’s in the house.” \nAnd while they didn’t want to talk about it during media night Monday: \n(Tom Brady) “I just wish everybody the best.” \n(Belichick) “I’m focused on trying to get our team ready to play the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday night.” \nIt’s unlikely coach Bill Belichick or quarterback Tom Brady would turn down the invite, they’re both long-time friends of President Trump. \nSeveral athletes, including Bruins goalie Tim Thomas and Matt Birk of the Ravens, declined to visit the White House during President Obama’s time in office. \nChris Hoenig, FOX News.
