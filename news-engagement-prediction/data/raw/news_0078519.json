Offering free drinks to the punters inside, Steve is fuming with Michelle’s actions as she sets out to sabotage his business until he agrees to her demands. \nAnd, when Eva Price tries to reason with Michelle and talk her out of what she is doing, Michelle sees red and grabs her by the hair, before launching her roughly out of the doors. (Picture: ITV) \nSteve feels that he has no other option but to contact the police in order to gain access to the pub and his home but when they arrive, will there be serious consequences for Michelle? \nAnd will the devastating pain he has caused Michelle hit home for Steve and persuade him that there really is no going back this time? (Picture: ITV) \nSpeaking about the highly charged scenes, Catherine Tyldesley, who plays Eva, enthused: ‘It was brilliant, I have wanted Eva to have a scrap for ages. I think Eva would do quite well in a proper fight as she is feisty but she is taken a bit by surprise by Michelle. (Picture: ITV) \n‘When I told my husband Tom that I had a cat fight coming up with Kym Marsh his words were “Salford vs Wigan! This will be a good ep!”‘ \nCoronation Street continues on Monday 27th February at 7:30pm and 8:30pm on ITV.
