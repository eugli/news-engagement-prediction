(Photo: NBA) \nHere's Giannis Antetokounmpo doing Giannis Antetokounmpo things . \nOn Saturday night, the Greek Freak looked just like Michael Jordan in Space Jam . He takes off from just inside the free-throw line, but when you slow it down and look at where he took his last dribble - it's almost more impressive than a free-throw line dunk. Actually, I think it is more impressive. Looks like #Giannis watched Space Jam before his game today! pic.twitter.com/OWgWEalxtw — NBA (@NBA) February 12, 2017 \nLet's break this down a bit: \nAt full speed in an actual game, he picks up his last dribble here - outside the 3-point line. \nThen, he takes his last step outside the circle… \n…which takes him a step inside the free-throw line, where he takes off and flies all the way to the hoop. \nAbsolutely ridiculous.
