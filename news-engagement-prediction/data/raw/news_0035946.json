But Izetbegovic insists it can and said it would be done by a lawyer the presidency appointed in 2002. \nBosnia’s legal team has “new arguments”, notably those presented during the trial of the Bosnian Serb wartime army chief, Ratko Mladic , who is awaiting judgement at a UN tribunal, Izetbegovic said. \nIn Belgrade, the Serbian prime minister, Aleksandar Vucic, labelled the decision “difficult and bad” for ties between the two neighbouring countries. \n“Despite everything, I’m convinced that we will manage to preserve our national interests,” Vucic was quoted saying by the Blic newspaper’s online edition. “However, we will continue to talk with Bosnian officials, wishing to assure a lasting peace in the Balkans.” \nThe Bosnian Serb leader, Milorad Dodik, called on ethnic Serb politicians to “challenge the legitimacy” of the demand for revision with the ICJ. \nOn Tuesday the Bosnian presidency’s Serb chairman, Mladen Ivanic, said that an appeal would violate the country’s constitution and further widen divisions among the rival ethnic groups. He said it would “threaten peace and stability in Bosnia”. Bosnian Serb MPs plan to boycott parliament to show their opposition. \nSince the war ended, Bosnia has consisted of two semi-independent entities: the Serbs’ Republika Srpska and the Muslim-Croat Federation. The two are linked by weak joint institutions. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T10:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T05:54:21.381+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
