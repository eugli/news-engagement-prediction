Although the celeb mom hasn't shared her due date with the press, a source told Us back in November \"Natalie's baby is due around the Oscars.\" \nAt the the Golden Globes in January, Portman looked very pregnant, glowy, and gorgeous in a golden yellow Prada gown . She always seems to knock it out of the park with her maternity style choices . (Portman was pregnant with Aleph when she took home her first Oscar for Best Actress for her performance in Black Swan in 2011.) And she's been opting for some seriously beautiful, retro-inspired gowns while promoting Jackie .
