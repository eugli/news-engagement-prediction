(© Jonathan Drake / Reuters/REUTERS) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS  08 AM \n\"What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban?\" President Donald Trump, Feb. 5 \nSorry, but I have to hand it to the President on this one. He's completely right: What IS our country coming to when all kinds of crazy stuff is happening that the President doesn't want? \nSure, critics are slamming President Trump for suggesting that his office is not subject to oversight by the judicial or legislative branches. The snooty Economist even wrote that Trump's question \"betrays an unfamiliarity with a basic principle of American constitutionalism.\" What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017 \nReally? To me, President Trump is onto something. I mean, what is our country coming to when we can't dispense with the Constitution at the whim of a mercurial President rapidly signing executive orders that he and the relevant agencies haven't even fully read ? \nPresident Trump says travel ban was a success despite protests \nSo in keeping with the President's outrage that a judge would nullify his completely huge executive order on immigration, I couldn't help but wonder about other facets of our nation that are going wrong. I mean: \nWhat is our country coming to when kids can't work 14 hours in the mines to supplement their family's income? Sad. Child labor was pretty effective, right? (Library of Congress/Corbis/VCG via Getty Images) \nWhat is our country coming to when a rich person can't outright own other people and compel them through violence or threat of federal imprisonment to perform whatever inhumane tasks he wants? \nWhat is our country coming to when a great show like \"The Apprentice,\" which had the top ratings of any show in history, has to die because there's nobody big enough or loved enough to host it? \nPresident Trump defends Vladimir Putin as a ‘killer’ \nWhat is our country coming to when people — I think they call themselves \"Members of Congress\" — can block the President's cabinet nominees and then hide behind Article II, Section 2 of the so-called United States Constitution? What is that? What is this country coming to when people working in this building think they have oversight over the President? (Mario Tama/Getty Images) \nWhat is our country coming to when mentally ill people can't exercise their right to own guns? I mean, Chicago is a war zone, and we need all the guns we can to end this American carnage. \nWhat is our country coming to when big companies even need to pay taxes at all? If there were no taxes, corporations like General Motors would have the money to build parks and schools and pay the Army to defend us. It's been nothing but federal overreach since we got rid of the Articles of Confederation! Cancel order! \nWhat is our country coming to when newspapers can write that people disagree with the President? No one disagrees with the President, except for a few million people who voted illegally . Why shouldn’t mining companies be able to dump toxins into rivers and streams? This is America! (Malven/iStock/Getty Images) \nWhat is our country coming to when some stupid moldy gift from France standing in New York Harbor is supposed to tell us that we can't completely reverse decades of open-hearted acceptance of refugees? Hashtag this: #SendBackTheStatue. \nWhat is our country coming to when mining companies can't just dump toxins into rivers and streams? Wait, someone is whispering in my ear. They can? When? Just last week ? Awesome. At least we're going in the right direction in one way!
