Disney is raising the price of admission for all its theme parks in 2017. On Sunday, the company announced that the increase will apply to all parks at Walt Disney World as well as Disneyland in Anaheim, California, Time notes . Though the price varies depending on the day and season you visit, the average ticket cost will increase by $5. Adults will now have to fork over anywhere from $107 to $124 for a one-day pass to all parks. But it's not just the older crowd that's seeing a jump in prices: The Orlando Sentinel reports that bringing your kids for a day of fun at the House of Mouse will also get more expensive, with the ticket cost for children ages 3 to 9 also rising. This isn't the first time Disney has asked guests to cough up a little more at the box office. This marks the second consecutive February that the entertainment giant has raised the price admission to its parks. \"Our pricing provides guests a range of options that allow us to better manage demand to maximize the guest experience and is reflective of the distinctly Disney offerings at all of our parks,\" the company said in a statement about the 2017 increases. If you're budgeting for your next vacation to the most magical place on Earth, make sure you save a little more, because it doesn't look like Disney will be getting cheaper any time soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T04:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:25:53.337+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
