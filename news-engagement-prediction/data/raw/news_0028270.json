CeeLo Green covered himself head to toe in gold and even he didn‚Äôt get more notice than Villa did. \nAnd of course since she dared to be different from the typical celebrity elites and show her patriotism, the Left and SJWs came out of the woodwork to attack her on Twitter. We couldn‚Äôt include most of them because they were just that foul but go ahead and take a look at their ‚Äútolerance‚Äù: @Joy_Villa So you're for fascism. Good to know. You know you'll be one of the first they throw in the camps, right? pic.twitter.com/05scqZoQOf \n‚Äî Renko Styranka üá®üá¶ (@RenkoStyranka) February 13, 2017 \nThese people. \n‚Äî Salem Elizabeth (@SalemElizabethQ) February 13, 2017 \nBlah blah blah blah blah.
