Rec Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images Veteran centerman Martin Hanzal is headed off to Minnesota as the Coyotes have dealt the 30-year-old to the Wild in exchange for every draft pick known to mankind a few draft picks. Ryan White is also headed to the Wild. Arizona receives a 2017 first round pick, a 2018 second round pick and a conditional pick that could become a second round pick in 2019, per Sportsnet’s Elliotte Friedman. Martin Hanzal and Ryan White from ARI to MIN for picks as specified here: https://t.co/VBUkOjV4DA — Bob McKenzie (@TSNBobMcKenzie) February 27, 2017 Hanzal is an unrestricted free agent this summer. Minnesota also received Arizona’s fourth round pick in 2017. Hanzal had a productive February for the Coyotes, scoring five goals in the last month. It’s not a huge offensive outburst, but the sudden production from the veteran did wonders for his trade value. Martin Hanzal is a third-liner with good shot impacts and some power-play results. How that's worth a high 1st is beyond me. pic.twitter.com/wPut3Xbd2u — Micah Blake McCurdy (@IneffectiveMath) February 27, 2017 The 30-year-old had been linked to the Canadiens as a possible trade candidate as early as late January, but Minnesota apparently came on stronger as the deadline approached. With the Coyotes out of the playoff picture, Arizona wisely decided to deal Hanzal while he was hot in return for assets they can use in the future. Hanzal has been with the Coyotes’ organization through his full nine and a half season NHL career. In 606 games, Hanzal has 311 points and is a fine veteran pickup for the Wild to secure their bottom-six scoring depth. Minnesota GM Chuck Fletcher is on a hot streak when it comes to scoring depth lately: Eric Staal and Chris Stewart have re-found their games under Bruce Boudreau’s tutelage, and the Wild are currently neck-and-neck with the Blackhawks atop the Western Conference. But the price he paid for a rental, bottom-six player sure seems pretty high.
