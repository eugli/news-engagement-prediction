Andrew Shaw wasn't called despite throwing the young Oilers' star to the ice and Tomas Plekanec upended McDavid soon after by dragging a foot and letting him trip over it.\nMcDavid drew a clear hooking call on Nathan Beaulieu at 12:42 when he snuck off the bench to intercept an Alexander Radulov pass and broke in on goal. Again the Edmonton power play could not connect.\nEleven minutes into the second frame, Weber wiped out at the blue line, sending McDavid's line in on a three-on-one that was broken up on a clever move by veteran defenceman Andrei Markov.\nMcDavid drew yet another penalty at 14:46, with Emelin complaining that he went down too easily on a partial hook.\nBoth teams were playing a third game in four days.\nMcDavid has 108 points in his 100 games.\nDavid Desharnais returned after being sat out one game to play centre, with Alex Galchenyuk moved to left wing. Brian Flynn was scratched.\n\nÂ© The Canadian Press, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T23:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T00:08:27.755+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
