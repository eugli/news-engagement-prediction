The This Is Us star, who portrays Kate Pearson on the popular NBC series, was a guest on The Wendy Williams Show on Friday, where she opened up about her character's kissing scenes with Chris Sullivan (Toby Damon) -- and why her beau isn't a fan! WATCH: Chrissy Metz Defends Chris Sullivan's 'This Is Us' Fat Suit \"His name is Josh, and he actually is a camera grip on our show,\" Metz said, blushing, when asked to spill all the details on her man. \"Yeah, it's a true story. We actually went to the Entertainment Weekly SAG Awards Pre-Party , and I thought, 'This is the first time that he's been out,' and I was nervous, because it's enough for one person to do it, you know, when you're in the spotlight, and then to bring a boyfriend, like, 'Oh my God!'\" But according to the 36-year-old actress, \"he did better than I did!\" \"I was more nervous than he was,\" she joked. \"He was just a pro and so congenial, and everyone loved him.\" RELATED: Chrissy Metz Makes First Red Carpet Appearance With Boyfriend Josh Stancil Metz then went on to explain how she and Stancil started dating after meeting on set. \"Well, I kind of made the [first] move,\" she confessed. \"What happened [was], he was eating, and I was like, 'Ooh, he's [cute].' Because I talk to everyone, I love people, I don't care what you do, we're all the same, we just have different jobs. So I was like, 'Oh my God, he's really cute.'\" \"So I said, 'Slow down! You're going to choke on your food,'\" she continued. \"And he starts cracking up. And I was like, 'Why did I just say that?' And so we just started chatting and it was like instant.\" WATCH: Chrissy Metz Blushes Over Her Real-Life Romance While everything else seems totally normal between the two on set, Metz said that things do feel somewhat awkward when Stancil has to film her romantic scenes with her onscreen boyfriend. \"Initially, I was like, 'This is gonna be weird,' but he was fine with it,\" she admitted. \"And then there was a really big kissing scene Chris and I did, who plays Toby, and he was like, 'I didn't like that.' He was like, 'Truth be told, that wasn't my favorite thing.'\" Last December, ET caught up with Metz at 102.7 KIIS-FM’s Jingle Ball 2016 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, where she talked about Stancil for the very first time. Back then, she had yet to reveal his name or his exact job title, as the relationship was so new. \"He's not an actor, but he is a sweet treat and he's wonderful,\" she marveled. \"It’s new, but I will be kissing him under the mistletoe.\" \"[We met] through a friend,\" she added, telling ET that she thinks she's in love. \"It's such a blessing -- really it is. It really is.\" WATCH: 'This Is Us' Cast Celebrates Stellar First Season With Wrap Party While season one of This Is Us is currently airing Tuesday nights at 9 p.m. ET on NBC, production has officially wrapped.
