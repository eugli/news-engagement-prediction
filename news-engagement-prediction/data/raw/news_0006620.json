Scheme to be nationally consistent and provide clients 'control' \nThe state's disability services minister will appoint four board members, and the remaining three will be appointed on recommendation of the Commonwealth minister. \nFederal Social Services Minister Christian Porter said the agreement provided people with a disability choice, control over their services and national consistency on eligibility and access to support services. \n\"There were 11 fixed conditions the Commonwealth required for a state-run NDIS in Western Australia to ensure consistency and integrity of the scheme is upheld across the country and I'm very pleased the agreement reflects all of these conditions,\" Mr Porter said. \nState legislation which mirrors key aspects of the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act will now need to be introduced. \nPremier Colin Barnett had long pushed for a locally-run scheme. \nHe said the agreement ensured services would be delivered by people based in WA who knew the communities they worked with. \n\"People with disability, their families and carers now have certainty about their future, and can rest assured they will receive the vital support they deserve,\" Mr Barnett said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T05:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:39:44.626+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
