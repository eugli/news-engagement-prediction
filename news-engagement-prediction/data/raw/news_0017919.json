Some FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies!” On Twitter , jokes about the tweet paired the text with nonsensical GIFs . Origin \nOn February 6th, 2017, President Trump tweeted “I call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it. Some FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies!” (shown below). [1] \nWhile it’s unclear what exactly Trump is referring to, The Daily Dot [3] cites speculation that Trump is taking issue with a New York Times article [2] posted on the 5th that insinuates former Breitbart executive chairman and current top White House advisor Stephen Bannon snuck in language to an executive order that promoted Bannon to the National Security Council, and that Trump was not aware of the addition until after he signed the order. Spread \nShortly after Trump’s tweet, Twitter users began pairing the text with unrelated images and GIFs to mock the tone and bizarreness of the tweet. One of the first popular examples, with 432 retweets, was posted by @MaynardBasilisk, who paired the text with a GIF of a man riding a boar (shown below).

Another popular variation of the joke was to use “I Call My Own Shots” in dialogue memes as an excuse for bad behavior, similar to how Twitter users responded to when Trump said to CNN’s Jake Tapper, You Are Fake News .
