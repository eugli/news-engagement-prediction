The people of the state have made up their mind to vote for their beti ,” she said. \n“Upset over this, Prime Minister Modi in his rally in Orai today said wrong things about the supreme leader of the BSP. Modi is saying all that that BSP is Behenji Sampatti Partry as he is upset over the growing voter base of BSP,” she said. \n“When he will get a tit-for-tat then he will forget how all this jumlebaazi ...BSP is a movement first then a political party. I have spent my whole to ensure that Dalit and Muslims stand on their feet,” Mayawati said. \n“I am not like Narendra Modi who married and then abandoned his wife. I have on the other hand dedicated my entire life for Dalits and minorities. And that's why people of the weaker sections of the society not just consider me as their leader but as their big asset,” she said. \nDirectly attacking the PM, she said, “Do you know the full name of Modi? It's Narendra Damodardas Modi. Narendra means negative, Damodardas means Dalit and Modi means man - he is 'negative Dalit man', which implies that he is a Dalit virodhi .” \nTo further position herself as the sole voice of Dalits and Muslims, she appealed to Muslims to take notice of the factional fight in the Samajwadi party and appealed them to desist from voting for the SP-Congress combine. \n“Mulayam Singh Yadav insulted his brother Shivpal to promote his son Akhilesh. Both the factions will do all that they can to ensure the defeat the other and this will lead to a division of votes. That's why if Muslims were to vote for the Samajwadi Party then their vote will get divided and the BJP will benefit,” she said. \n“Muslims should unitedly vote for the BSP. Our Dalit vote base is intact; if Muslims vote in tandem then the BJP can never come to power in the state,” Mayawati asserted. \nOn Akhilesh's election slogan ' Kam bolta hai ', the BSP leader said if his work was to speak then what is the need for him to hold seven election rallies each day. \nAlleging that the SP government has become synonyms with jungle raj, Mayawati said only ' Aparadh bolta hai ' in Up under SP. \nShe also appealed to the people to vote and form a taintless BSP government. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T13:16:01.101+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
