She thought I was leaving because of her,” Philbin said of Ripa. “I was leaving because I was getting older and that wasn’t right for me anymore.” \n“She took it personal?” King asked. \n“Yeah, I think so,” Philbin replied. \nPhilbin was conspicuously absent from Ripa’s 15th anniversary celebration in February 2016, which drew a host of famous faces to the studio in her honor. According to Philbin, the show has “never once” asked him to return since he left in 2011, even for a day of guest hosting. In fact, the veteran presenter revealed last year that he hasn’t seen or spoken with Ripa since. \nWhen King asked if he and Ripa keep in touch these days, Philbin admitted, “Not really, no.” \nDespite the fracture in their friendship, Philbin still has a taste for TV. The 85 year-old says he misses the thrill of hosting live television and would consider returning if the situation was right. \n“I don’t know. How often would it be? Would it be every night? Every day?” Philbin said. “I do miss it. There are times when I really miss it and wish I’d never stopped. But, you know, I just figured it was time to let go.” \nRipa hosts “Live!” solo with a revolving door of guest co-hosts ever since Michael Strahan’s controversial exit in 2016 . The former football star reportedly negotiated his departure without informing Ripa. Although Strahan claims the two are “friends” now, we’ll always remember his final week on “Live!” when Ripa ruthlessly shaded him in front of an audience of millions. \nNote to all future co-hosts: Kelly Ripa is not the one to mess with.
