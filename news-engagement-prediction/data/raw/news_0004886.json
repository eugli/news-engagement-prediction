The US regularly tells China its currency is too cheap and gives its products an advantage in world markets.\n'Independent' Germany - which is the biggest economy in the 19-country bloc - differs from much of the rest by selling far more goods abroad than it imports, giving it a large trade surplus.\nAccording to official figures from Destatis , in November 2016 Germany exported goods worth 108.5bn euros and imported goods to the value of 85.8bn euros - the highest monthly figures ever calculated both for exports and imports.\nAnalysis: Andrew Walker, economics correspondent Has Germany done well out of the euro? The case that it has is about trade.\nThe argument is that the euro has been weaker than the Deutsche Mark would have been, and that has supported German exports.\nGermany now has very large surplus in its international trade; the current account surplus (which includes some financial flows as well as goods and services) is 8% of the size of the country's economy.\nIt's another question whether having a large surplus is a good thing or not.\nIn any event, there's another side to Germany's competitiveness.\nWages rose very slowly in the years after the launch of the euro.\nThe country's unit labour costs (which allow for improvements in efficiency) actually fell in the euro's first decade.\nAnd Germany is paying something for keeping the eurozone whole. For sure, the bailouts are loans. But the interest rates are so low and the repayment terms have been extended so much (this is especially true of Greece) that there is a cost for the lenders, the largest of which is Germany.\nIn response to Mr Navarro's comments, Mrs Merkel said: \"Germany is a country that has always called for the European Central Bank to pursue an independent policy, just as the Bundesbank did that before the euro existed.\"\n\"Because of that we will not influence the behaviour of the ECB. And as a result, I cannot and do not want to change the situation as it is,\" she added.\nMr Navarro is also an economics professor at the University of California, Irvine Mr Trump has made trade one of the central planks of a proposed radical overhaul of the way the US interacts with the rest of the world.\nHe has outlined a number of protectionist trade policies with the stated intention of creating more US jobs, including threatening to scrap a number of existing free trade agreements.\nHe has suggested withdrawing the US from the World Trade Organization, and in his first week on the job scrapped the Trans-Pacific Partnership .\nChina has also been singled out, and Mr Navarro has been a fierce critic of China.", "external_links": ["https://www.ft.com/content/57f104d2-e742-11e6-893c-082c54a7f539", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38721056", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-31/euro-is-g-10-s-most-undervalued-currency-by-oecd-measure-chart", "https://www.destatis.de/EN/PressServices/Press/pr/2017/01/PE17_006_51.html;jsessionid=74244B2AB9EAC414BFC52D7EB45BF0AE.cae1", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/667F/production/_93893262_merkel.jpg", "https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=ULC_ANN#", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/45AD/production/_93073871_navarro.jpg"], "published": "2017-01-31T20:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:57:55.566+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
