Czuprynski can use medical marijuana while on probation. \nSaginaw County District Judge M. Randall Jurrens, visiting a Bay County courtroom, presided over a hearing Wednesday, Feb. 22, to rule on motions filed by Czuprysnki. In his motions, Czuprynski sought to lift a condition of his probation which prohibited him from using medical marijuana, which Jurrens instituted when he sentenced Czuprysnki to 18 months' probation on Jan. 18. \nCzuprynski, a licensed medical marijuana patient who uses the cannabinoid to treat arthritis, argued he should not be prohibited from its use as such a ban would amount to an unlawful impingement on the privacy inherent in a physician-patient relationship. He also argued the crime he was convicted of had nothing to do with marijuana and, as such, keeping him from using the substance would not serve any rehabilitative purpose. \n\"Personally, I think the law supports my motion,\" Czuprynski told the judge. \nGenesee County Assistant Prosecutor Chris Larobardiere, who prosecuted Czuprysnki at trial, objected to Czuprynski's motions. \nJurrens said that, in his opinion, there is too little oversight in the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act and people can obtain marijuana too easily. \nEdward Czuprynski gets probation, argues again he was railroaded by police \n\"My concern is people can literally go to a head shop, find a physician, pay $50 or more, and on the first occasion, get physician certification,\" he said. \"That's not what any of us expected when we voted for medical marijuana.\" \nJurrens had also prohibited Czuprynski from consuming alcohol or being in bars while on probation. Though he opposed that at the time of his sentencing, Czuprynski said he was no longer contesting that condition. \n\"I can live without alcohol, no problem with that, but without medical marijuana...,\" he said. \"My medical history shows that.\" \nCzuprynski said he doesn't care for pharmaceutical painkillers, as they don't work well for him. In his capacity as a lawyer, he's seen many people become addicted to opiates as well, he said. \n\"I much prefer the organic solution that has proven most effective to me,\" he said. \nIn issuing his ruling, the judge voiced misgivings and chastised Czuprynski, to the point it initially seemed he was going to rule against the motions. He referenced testimony taken during Czuprynski's trial that indicated he had drank a beer and taken a sleeping pill before driving. \n\"To me, it's somewhat disconcerting that an individual would have a seemingly cavalier attitude of getting behind the wheel of car, be willing to consume alcohol, and take a sleeping pill before driving, even if neither had any impact on the offense for which he was convicted,\" Jurrens said. \"I was similarly dismayed by attitude the defendant had at sentencing. The defendant was combative, asserted blame on the victim rather than asserting blame on himself, and it just disappointed me.\" \nThe judge then addressed Czuprynski directly. \nEd Czuprynski settles lawsuit for $1 million with man he crashed into \n\"Mr. Czuprynski, I have a lot of respect for you, for the role you play in society as a criminal defense attorney,\" he said. \"It would be helpful if during your probation you conveyed the appropriate remorse and acceptance of the jury's verdict.\" \nThe judge then expressed confliction over how to rule. \n\"I struggle with my good faith desire to create a set of circumstances where Mr. Czuprynski can learn and demonstrate to himself that he doesn't need alcohol and illicit drugs to navigate through life,\" he said. \"Even though the condition may not have the direct logical relationship to the offense, I was actually hoping Mr. Czuprynski would submit to the condition, realizing life without alcohol and illicit drugs might be better. But I can't necessarily impose personality traits that aren't there and won't be accepted. What may be my belief system cannot be necessarily imposed on the defendant. I come back full circle to look at the law, which I'm obligated to follow.\" \nJurrens then lifted the condition. \nBackground \nCzuprynski's conviction stems from an incident that occurred the night of June 16, 2015. At about 10:30 p.m., police responded to a car-pedestrian collision at the intersection of Center Avenue and Scheurmann Road in Hampton Township. Trial testimony indicated Czuprynski had been driving his red 2003 Buick LeSabre east on Center from his Bay City law office to his Essexville home when he collided with 52-year-old James S. Stivenson, who was walking south across Center toward Rebel Food Store. \nCzuprynski had taken a sleeping aid shortly before the crash, but argued it had not entered his bloodstream when the crash occurred. \nCzuprynski was charged with a felony count of operating a motor vehicle while visibly impaired by a controlled substance causing serious bodily impairment, but the jury acquitted him of this offense. \nCzuprynski maintained, even at his sentencing, that he was railroaded by police. At his sentencing, Czuprynski said that while he feels bad for Stivenon's injuries, he did not cause it. Stivenson was wearing black clothing and had a blood alcohol level of 0.19 when the crash occurred. \n\"I would submit, your honor, that's the cause of the accident,\" he said. \"I feel bad about it, but I do not feel remorseful, if that's the proper word, as I did not cause it.\" \nStivenson filed a lawsuit against Czuprynski. On Feb. 7, Czuprynski settled the suit for more than $1 million.
