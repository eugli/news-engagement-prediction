IPL Auction: Can a T20 triple century propel you straight into IPL? Comments When schoolboy sensations Sachin Tendulkar and Vinod Kambli scored triple centuries and a record 600+ run partnership way back in the 1980s, Test legend Sunil Gavaskar clamoured that they be immediately taken into the Test team. \nBoth were offered a place in the Mumbai Ranji team. Tendulkar grabbed the opportunity with both hands and the rest is history. (Kambli declined and took the more circuitous Under-19 route). \nIn the IPL age, nothing is a given and such knocks may not get you far. Just look at Pranav Dhanawade. Despite scoring an unheard of 1000+ runs in an innings in a school tournament he failed to make it to the next stage and even got arrested as he was on a practice ground where a VVIP chopper was to land. \nBy Sunil Rajguru", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T13:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T12:14:57.438+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
