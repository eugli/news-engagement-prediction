It reflects the school’s commitment in terms of teaching and learning of mother tongue languages - not just Chinese, but all three.” \nEarlier, Ms Low said she was heartened by the enthusiasm shown by parents and students for Higher Chinese language. “We want to assure the House that the schools are deeply committed to the teaching and learning of Higher Mother Tongue languages,” she noted. “We do so because its not just about mastering a higher level of language, but deepening bilingualism which is an integral part of national identity and cultural heritage.” - CNA/jo", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T15:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T10:18:09.865+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
