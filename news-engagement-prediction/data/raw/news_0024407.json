Among the highlights: \n“Individual rivalries just aren’t there anymore . . . we were friends then, but you wouldn’t know it by the way we competed on the court.\" \n\"The '80s, '90s and early 2000s genes of competitive fire are dead and gone . . . You have about one or two guys who I see that in: (Russell) Westbrook and maybe like a DeMarcus Cousins. . . . Pretty much everybody else it’s a different type of attitude.\" \nThis last line might make it awkward when Pierce sees his current team’s pitbull point guard, Chris Paul, but that’s not the thing to focus on here. \nMORE: Paul Pierce feels all the love from Celtics fans \nThe idea the NBA has lost its competitive edge is not a new one, but hearing it from a highly respected Hall of Fame-caliber player who’s still in the league is a good excuse to remind everyone of one moment that signified the death of true fiery competition in the league. And that it was initiated by the league’s most influential player. \nIn the third quarter of Game 2 of the 2013 Eastern Conference finals, Paul George drove past LeBron James for a vicious right-handed dunk on the head of Chris Andersen, who was waiting at the rim. It was the “Hello, world” moment for the third-year player and a rough sequence for Birdman, an 11-year vet. \nBut what made it worse for Birdman was the fact the best player in the NBA went out of his way to meet George at halfcourt and give him props for his play. \nAre you kidding me with this? \nCan you imagine Michael Jordan making an effort to high-five John Starks after The Dunk on Horace Grant in 1993? Grant would’ve gripped MJ up real quick. And Birdman had every right to get in LeBron’s face after that. What kind of message does that send to teammates and the rest of the league? \nThe message is “We’re all boys” and the killer instinct to crush your opponent is just not a thing. \nThis gesture is emblematic of LeBron’s persona throughout his career, highlighted by The Decision to remove a boatload of pressure from his shoulders in Miami, which paved the way for Kevin Durant’s even softer move to Golden State. It’s simple: Instead of having the fire to beat the other best players in the world, players today feel the need to sit at the cool table and play reduced-pressure basketball as best friends. \nLeBron made everyone temporarily forget this with an otherworldly performance in last year’s Finals, but the mushy attitude is back on full display this season as he constantly whines to the media about needing better teammates. Charles Barkley was on the money when he ripped LeBron for this . And LeBron's firing back proved he's comfortable having conflicts with retired guys, just not ones he has to play against. \nMORE: LeBron trashes Barkley for his critical comments \nIn the ‘90s, Barkley would’ve been joined by a horde of others ( except maybe Shaq ) questioning LeBron’s need to live a cushy Nerf life surrounded by talent. As ex-Bulls general manager Jerry Krause told The Vertical about Michael Jordan: “He never came to me and asked for other players . . . He thought he was so darn good (that) he could win without them.” \nLeBron sets the tone for the rest of the league and pretty much all young aspiring basketball players in the country. When you see a living legend dapping up an opponent who just embarrassed one of his teammates on a huge stage, what else is a 15-year-old kid supposed to think? It can squash a competitive edge at an early age. \nSo Paul Pierce is right . While the NBA is still a great product, witnessing a chummy mentality permeate the league is tough for people who appreciated the grittiness and heated rivalries that began to evaporate about 10 years ago. \nMany factors have contributed to this, but it starts with the face of the league. \nHere’s to hoping Draymond Green can rough LeBron up in a Finals series enough to unleash rage The King has thus far only directed toward an analyst behind a desk.
