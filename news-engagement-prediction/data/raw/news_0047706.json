REUTERS/Stephen Yang \nLONDON — Juhel Miah, a British Muslim teacher from Swansea, was denied entry to the United States while on a school trip last week, the Guardian reports . \nDespite a suspension of US President Donald Trump's travel ban, Miah, who was with other teachers and a group of children. The group was about to leave Reykjavik, Iceland for New York, but he was removed from the plane before takeoff. \nThe 25-year-old maths teacher, who is a British citizen, does not have dual nationality, but had valid visa documents. \nHe said he was made to feel like a criminal: \"Everyone was looking at me. As I was getting my luggage the teachers and kids were confused. I couldn’t believe this was happening. I was being escorted out. It made me feel like a criminal. I couldn’t speak, I was lost for words.\" \nMiah said as soon as he showed his passport during check-in, he was told he had been selected for a \"random security check,\" but was given the \"all clear.\" After he was removed from the plane, Miah said he was taken to a hotel where he waited for two hours in a \"horrendous\" room. \nMiah's employer, the Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council, has written to the US embassy in London to demand an explanation. In a statement , it said: \"Whilst the school trip proceeded as planned, Mr Miah's removal from the flight left pupils and colleagues shocked and distressed.\" \nA council spokesperson added that it was \"appalled\" by the treatment Miah, who is a \"popular and respected teacher,\" and that it had raised the issue with their local MP. \n\"No satisfactory reason has been provided for refusing entry to the United States — either at the airport in Iceland or subsequently at the US Embassy in Reykjavik. Mr Miah attempted to visit the Embassy; but was denied access to the building. Understandably he feels belittled and upset at what appears to be an unjustified act of discrimination,\" the spokesperson said .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T16:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:28:49.239+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
