Credit Jabin Botsford/The New York Times WASHINGTON — With Republicans now in power across the government, Congress has moved aggressively toward undoing Obama-era tech policies. Net neutrality , the rule that ensures equal access to all websites, and broadband privacy rules are the first targets. Lawmakers also hope to play a bigger role than in the last administration on policies of particular concern to Silicon Valley and internet users, including driverless cars and the scaling back of Federal Communications Commission powers concerning broadband providers. We talked to Senator John Thune , Republican of South Dakota, who leads the commerce committee that oversees the technology and telecommunications industries, about these efforts. The interview was edited for clarity and length. How do you want to change net neutrality rules? We’re open for business. We think a legislative solution is the best alternative and that the F.C.C. under Chairman Tom Wheeler went too far with regulations that were overreaching and basically classified the internet as a public utility under a 1934 statute. Congress needs to be heard from, or you will have a constant back-and-forth on this issue depending on which party is in the White House. What would your law look like? What’s really worked for the internet is the light touch. Legislation would basically prevent blocking, throttling and paid prioritization but doesn’t go to the extreme of reclassifying broadband as a telecommunications service. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story How about bans on zero rating, which is the practice by T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon of giving unlimited streaming to select content? On zero rating, F.C.C. Chairman Ajit Pai has already expressed a preference on that: It is something consumers seem to love. To be able to download or stream without letting it count against your data plan is extremely popular with consumers. I don’t have a problem with that. Will you work with the F.C.C. chairman, and how will you get Democrats on board? It may take action by the F.C.C. first in order to get the stars aligned. I think that if the F.C.C. starts moving in the other direction, it might prompt Democrats on the Hill to say, “You know what, maybe a legislation solution makes sense.” What about broadband privacy rules created in early 2016? Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona and Representative Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee have proposed killing privacy rules through a shortcut legislative process known as the Congressional Review Act .
