He plans to be in Athens, Ga. soon. Slot to Georgia Links \nDefensive back Chris Smith (Atlanta/Hapeville Charter) has picked up recent offers from Alabama, Maryland, Duke, Louisville, Oregon, N.C. State, and Michigan State. The Alabama offer sticks out to the 6-foot, 165-pound junior, along with a pair of SEC programs. \n\"UGA and Auburn,\" Smith said, on vsporto's SEC Recruiting Buzz. \"I talk to the coaches all the time. I talked to Coach Smart a few weeks ago and he just said he likes the way I play. He likes my physicalness. He wants to get me up.\" \n(What's next for the Bulldogs? Make sure you're in the loop -- take a few moments to sign up for our FREE Bulldogs Newsletter! ) \nSmith, who received an offer from the Bulldogs in November, plans to be up in Athens, Ga. very soon. \n\"I think I am going up there on the 18th when they have a basketball game against Kentucky,\" Smith said. \nSmith has a high school teammate who just signed with Georgia in defensive back William Poole III . \n\"He said it feels like home,\" Smith said. \"He likes the family environment and he feels like he has a good opportunity to play. So do I - I think he will be able to go up there and play very well. He said the coaches are cool and when I get up there on the 18th I will be able to see more of the campus.\" \nAnother SEC program is recruiting him the hardest. \n\"I would say South Carolina is recruiting me the hardest, and then a very close second would be UGA,\" Smith said. \nSmith is trying to formulate a plan for making a decision. \n\"I plan to narrow things down after the school year,\" Smith said. \"People are still coming up here and giving me offers, so I want to make sure all the schools interested in me have an opportunity to recruit me before I narrow it down. When I plan to sign? After seeing those guys on national signing day 2017, that was pretty special and I really liked that. Signing day might be when I announce my decision, but my schools would be very narrow by then. I might even silent commit. Or, if I choose early enrollment it would be before December. I have not really made my decision, but I know it is getting close to crunch time. I have to make a decision because spots are closing up.
