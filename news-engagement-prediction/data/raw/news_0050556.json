In a news briefing Monday morning, retired policeman Arturo Lascanas backed up 2016 allegations made by former hitman Edgar Matobato, including claims of a 300-member execution squad run out of the southern city of Davao. \"I was one of those who started it,\" he said. \"We implemented the personal instructions of (then-Mayor) Duterte to us. All of the killings we did in Davao city, whether we buried or threw them out to sea.\" Retired police officer Arturo Lascanas speaks during a news conference at the Philippine Senate in suburban Pasay, south of Manila, on Monday, February 20. Duterte, though a spokesman, dismissed the allegations as \"nothing but vicious politics.\" \"The Commission of Human Rights, the Office of the Ombudsman, the Senate Committee on Justice already cleared the President of extrajudicial killing and his involvement in the Davao Death Squad,\" Presidential Communications Secretary Martin Andanar said in a statement. Read More Lascanas gave testimony last year in a Senate probe in which he denied being a member of the squad and of having a close relationship with Duterte. Retired Davao Senior Superintendent Dionisio Abude during the same inquiry denied the existence of death squads. At the news conference, Lascanas said Monday he was confessing in an effort \"to follow God's will ... and love for my country and for my own conscience.\" The event was organized by opposition Senator Antonio Trillanes IV. Lascanas takes his oath during a Senate hearing in Manila on October 3. Allegations of mosque bombings, killings Lascanas said the squad had undertaken many killings and other criminal actions, either at the orders of Duterte or his associates. Duterte served as mayor of Davao for 10 years starting in 1988, then again from 2001 to 2010, and from 2013 to 2016. Lascanas said the squad had been ordered by Duterte personally to bomb Davao mosques in 1993 in retaliation for the bombing of San Pedro Cathedral.
