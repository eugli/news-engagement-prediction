One of them shot him at least three times, hitting him in the stomach.\n\"The attacker fell to the ground, seriously wounded. He has been taken to hospital and is fighting for his life,\" the prosecutor said.\nHe was carrying a rucksack which contained paint spray cans - but no explosives.\nThe guards on patrol outside the museum were just some of the thousands of troops lining the streets as part of the stepped-up response to a series of attacks in France since 2015.\nThough still hugely popular, the Louvre has suffered a drop in visitor numbers amid fears of a militant attack.\nA series of assaults by gunmen and suicide bombers claimed by so-called Islamic State killed 130 people in November 2015.\nIn January of the same year, 17 people were killed in an attack on the Charlie Hebdo magazine and linked shootings.\nLast July, 86 people were killed when a lorry ploughed through crowds celebrating Bastille Day in Nice.\nSecurity has become a theme of the French presidential election in April, which sees far-right leader Marine Le Pen and centrist independent Emmanuel Macron leading the polls.", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/636E/production/_93945452_d19876e4-a49c-42da-a14b-6a586070737e.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/C277/production/_93938794_louvre_paris_france_map624.png", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/257A/production/_93949590_688242fe-12d2-4311-8559-ba034bc7e652.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-04T02:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T05:42:08.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
