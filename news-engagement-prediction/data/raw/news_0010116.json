With just 3 films hitting the screens, he has earned a place, what some in the Industry fail to get in their entire lifetime. After being graced with Dadasaheb Phalke Film Foundation Award, for most popular actor & director for his second film MSG -2 , Saint Dr. MSG has one more feather in his cap; he has been awarded with the Bright Award, for Best Actor and Most versatile Personality of the year, in a grand event held at Peninsula Grand, Mumbai on February 6. \nSaint Dr. Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh Ji Insan has been credited with 43 credits in his upcoming film Hind Ka Napak Ko Jawab – MSG Lion Heart-2 , which includes a plethora of roles that this rockstar Saint has handled, from direction, acting, choreography, VFX, sound, music, singing, right up to publicity designing, prop designing etc. He has handled 30 departments in his earlier film, MSG Lion Heart -1 and this time around this list has grown to 43. We really need to figure out what is left out, this time! \nAs you might have guessed, his versatility is totally beyond imagination, even for the best and the most experienced. He is also referred to as ‘One Man Army’; given the ease that he handles every department in filmmaking. Seems like there is nobody even close to this rocking Saint, who is churning out blockbuster films, which are revolutionizing the concept of entertainment.
