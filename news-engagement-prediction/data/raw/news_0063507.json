Wheeler and Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Sandra Battle wrote that the administration was withdrawing the Obama rules because they didn’t “contain extensive legal analysis or explain how the position is consistent with the express language of Title IX, nor did they undergo any formal public process.”\nThey added that former President Barack Obama’s rules had set off “significant litigation,” in particular as courts differed over the definition of the term “sex.” The letter also emphasized the agencies’ preference that states and local school districts be given a “primary role” in setting education policy.\nLast year, the Obama administration had warned states, including North Carolina, that such requirements violated the Civil Rights Act, which broadly bars discrimination on the basis of sex. The guidance staked a position in a contentious debate about transgender rights, including whether schools and states can require people to use sex-segregated facilities, including bathrooms, that correspond to the sex on their birth certificates.\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.\nThis medical device scans your brain on marijuana (2:52) The BrainBot, a brain-scanning technology developed by tech startup PotBotics, enables physicians to pick a marijuana strain that is most suited for their patients' needs.\nAlso popular on WSJ.com:\nNascar, once a cultural icon, hits the skids.\nA strategy for happy dual-career couples.\nMore from MarketWatch Here's Why Your Car Insurance Rates Are Spiking At Trump Presser, a Tale of Two Realities Flying Drone Taxis Could Take Off in Dubai", "external_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-strategy-for-happy-dual-career-couples-1487699443?mod=mktw", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/long-in-victory-lane-nascar-hits-the-skids-1487686349?mod=mktw", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-set-to-rescind-obama-rules-on-transgender-bathroom-use-1487790631?mod=mktw"], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:38:05.672+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
