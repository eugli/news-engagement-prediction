Photo: Glenn Hunt \nThe refund is approximately $150 per person, and about half of this compensation payment was revealed in a report from ASIC last October that uncovered widespread short-changing of customers in the major banks' wealth divisions. \nMembers were charged \"planned service fees\" under NAB's MLC MasterKey Business Super and MLC MasterKey Personal Super products, which should have given members access to general financial advice. However, the bank had failed to provide such advice, the watchdog said. Advertisement \nAs well, ASIC said NAB had wrongly denied 10 insurance claims for death and total and permanent disablement cover between 2012 and 2015. It is also refunding affected customers for these errors, paying out $1.8 million. \nIn response to these flaws, NAB has commissioned an independent assurance review, to be carried out by KPMG, into the bank's superannuation business. \nKPMG's review will investigate risk management procedures, its processes for implementing product changes, and how conflicts of interest are managed within this part of the bank. \nNAB's acting executive general manager for wealth products, Garry Mulcahy, said the review was aimed at giving super customers more confidence in the bank's systems and processes. \n\"Over the past five years, we've made substantial changes to upgrade and simplify our superannuation business to better serve our customers' needs,\" Mr Mulcahy said. \n\"We've merged five of our super funds to create Australia's largest retail super fund, the MLC Super Fund, with $70 billion funds under management, and we've also implemented significant regulatory change, including Future of Financial Advice (FoFA) reforms and Stronger Super.\" \nThe NAB errors were revealed by ASIC as it also said Bankwest had wrongly calculated $4.9 million in home loan interest for customers with offset accounts, leading to refunds for 10,800 clients. \nThe breach, which ASIC said was uncovered through an internal investigation, meant that some customers who opened accounts between 2007 and 2016 were overcharged interest on their home loans. \nASIC said Bankwest investigated the issue after media coverage of ASIC's work in relation to similar breaches at other banks. It then reported the matter to the regulator. \nThe bungle represents a significant breach of the bank's licence obligations, the regulator said. \n\"It is critical that licensees ensure that their systems work properly so that promises made to customers about their bank accounts are kept,\" ASIC deputy chairman Peter Kell said. \n\"When a problem is identified, licensees not only have an obligation to report the breach, but impacted customers must be returned to the position they would have been in, had the breach not occurred.\" \nASIC said Bankwest had since updated its systems and processes, including the automatic linking of new offset accounts. \nThe regulator said the bank had contacted customers it had identified as being affected to arrange a refund. \nAn offset account is a savings or transaction account linked to a home loan that is designed to reduce the interest on the home loan. \nBankwest has been contacted for comment.
