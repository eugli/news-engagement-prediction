Pierce Feb 22, 2017 T i ger Beat On The Potomac has an interesting bit of stenograph…er…reporting about how the Republicans are planning to make Senator Professor Warren the Scary Monster of the 2018 midterm elections. The usual Republican suspects chime in with substance-free roogie-roogie. From TBOTP : \n\"In the states that Trump won that Democrats are running in, I can't imagine that she helps them. I think she hurts them,\" said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), a former chairman of the NRSC. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below And, also: \nSen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), who initiated the effort to sideline Warren during the Sessions debate, said the Massachusetts senator's ascendance helps the GOP. \"One of the responsibilities when you represent an entire state is to listen to all of the voices,\" said Daines, who himself experienced a boomlet of attention after telling Warren to take her seat. \"Ultimately, you want to make sure you are aligned with where most Montanans are on an issue. And I can tell you most Montanans are not aligned with Elizabeth Warren.\" Most Popular OK, so this is what every Republican is supposed to say. What's interesting in the piece are the mealy-mouthed Democratic senators who offer their watery support to one of their own. Here's Heidi Heitkamp. \n\"To suggest that we're Elizabeth Warren is ridiculous, especially when you look at voting records and where we've been,\" said Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.). \"They need a boogeyman, and they're trying to turn Elizabeth into a boogeyman. And I think maybe what they should worry about more is actually doing America's work.\" And Jon Tester: \n\"There are some people in Montana that love her,\" said Tester, a Democrat who is up in 2018. \"There are some people in Montana that hate her. And there are a lot of shades of gray in between.\" And, inevitably, Joe Manchin: \n\"She has her own brand. And I think I have my own brand in my own state, so it really doesn't hurt me,\" said Manchin. \"They've tried the 'guilty by association' with [Obama.]\" \"Guilty\" of what, precisely, Senator? Really, gang, go into a crouch now. Avoid the rush.

But what are the issues for which she stands that would so revolt voters in the sticks? A sensible financial regulation system that prevailed in this country for 50 relatively prosperous years? A protection against the trickeration that you find on the back of every credit card? An end to usurious practices in the student loan industry? All of these things poll very well in every poll I've ever seen. No, it's all about Noisy Woman Who Should Shut Up and Sit Down . It's a card that Republicans reliably can be depended upon to play, election after election. It's distressing to see Democratic politicians already preparing to fold their hands.
