Gas prices: 5 reasons they rise and fall \nThe decline has come even as greenhouse gas emissions from energy have been falling over the past decade. \nEnergy consumption as a share of total household consumption expenditures averaged 3.9 percent in 2016, the first time it has dropped below 4.0 percent since records began, according to the factbook. \nAt the same time, the factbook's authors say greenhouse-gas emissions from the energy sector shrank 5.3 percent year-on-year in 2016, bringing them to 24.1 percent below 2005 levels. \nTotal US greenhouse-gas emissions fell to their lowest levels in 25 years last year, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. \nShifts in the energy-generation mix saw natural gas eclipse coal to become the largest source of US generating capacity, at 34 percent of the mix. \nCoal fell to second place with 30 percent of the generating mix—its lowest share on record. \nIn comparison, coal's share in 2007 was 49 percent, while natural gas was at 22 percent. \nRenewable energy increased from 8 percent to 15 percent of the energy-generating mix in the same period. \nOver the last five years, renewable-energy projects have also represented 62 percent of US generating-capacity additions, according to Energy Information Administration and Bloomberg data. \nThe US is the second-largest global depository for renewable-energy investments, says Bloomberg. \nIn 2016, utility-scale photovoltaic solar installations reached 8.9 gigawatts, nearly doubling the previous record of 4.4 GW set in 2015. \nLast year also saw 7.2 GW of coal-fired power plants retired. That figure does not include plants converted to natural gas or other fuels. Follow Stories Like This \nGet the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.
