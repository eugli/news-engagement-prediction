In the past the eyewear brand has asked the likes of Karlie Kloss , stylist and founder of Lula magazine Leith Clark, and ethically inclined brand Maiyet to create capsules. Today they launched their latest partnership, this time with multi-hyphenate TV host, producer, and photographer Amanda de Cadenet.\nThe two frames, Ella (a chunky black style) and Silvan (a pale pink pair), are named after de Cadenet’s twins. While Ella only comes as an optical style, Silvan can also be worn as sunglasses. To celebrate the launch, Warby Parker has made a donation to GirlGaze , an organization founded by de Cadenet that benefits and supports female-identifying photographers. In addition, they asked some of their photographers to shoot the frames, in their own unique style, as a part of their Instagram promotion. Scroll ahead to see how they interpreted the styles in these exclusive images.\nShot by Shingi Rice/@bluespit Shot by Krissy Saleh/@krissy Photo: Girlgaze Project Shot by Hana Mendel/@hanamendel Photo: Girlgaze Project Shot by Bree Holt/@exquisiteeye Photo: Copyright 2017.
