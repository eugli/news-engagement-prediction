Slot to Dallas Links \nThe writing is on the wall for Tony Romo when it comes to the Dallas Cowboys , although the graffiti is a bit difficult to read. \nThe veteran quarterback is reportedly willing to rework his contract to help facilitate a trade, but ultimately expects the team to release him if one doesn't materialize. The only virtual certainty is that Romo will not retire, but whatever happens will have a direct result on what the Cowboys do at the backup QB position. \nIt's now being reported the team has interest in newly-released veteran Josh McCown , but it'll depend on what course they take with Romo. \nThere's mutual interest between #Cowboys and backup QB Josh McCown . But Tony Romo decision must come first. Could be factor in TR timing \nThe Cowboys’ season may be over, but they’re not mailing it in. Don’t miss any breaking offseason news, take a second to sign up for our FREE Cowboys messenger! \nIt's not the first time the Cowboys have been keen on McCown, as there was interest this time last year -- before the Browns vetoed any potential negotiations. Now released, the Cowboys now have a shot at signing the QB without giving up additional assets. \nWhat a difference a year makes. \nOwner and general manager Jerry Jones would love some veteran talent behind rookie Dak Prescott going forward, and they'll need to think hard on if they should retain both Kellen Moore and Mark Sanchez . \nThe two have a combined record of 0-8 in their last eight games with only 10 touchdowns to 13 interceptions -- making McCown an attractive option. \nOn Saturday, Jones stated he has not had any discussion with Romo as of yet regarding his future. With free agency to begin on March 9, however, it's a discussion that's likely soon to come. \nThat is especially if they don't want to lose McCown to another club.
