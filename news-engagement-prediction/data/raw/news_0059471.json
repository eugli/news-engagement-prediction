The IPCC said they found no cases to answer in relation to the call handlers.\nOur investigation established a significant delay between the officers accepting the call and attending Ms Begum's home.\nIt will now be a matter for a panel to determine whether or not the response of the officers breached the standards of professional behaviour. The hearing will take place in London on February 27 and 28.\n– Colin Dewar, headed the IPCC investigation Last updated Wed 22 Feb 2017 London", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:03:58.516+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
