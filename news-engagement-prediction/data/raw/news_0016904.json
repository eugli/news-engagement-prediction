After a brief pause, he added, “And then we just smash his face into the table.”\nThe former California governor, though, ultimately decided to take the high road. “And then I think, ‘We can’t do that, either.’ I think I have to be above all of that and put him on the spot,” Schwarzenegger said.\nAs TheBlaze previously reported , this feud made national headlines last week, when Trump joked during the National Prayer Breakfast that people should “pray for Arnold” because the ratings have gone “right down the tubes” since he took over as host of “Celebrity Apprentice.”\nBut the first comment came in early January. The president slammed the ratings of the NBC program and took a dig at Schwarzenegger, who endorsed Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) during the Republican primaries, for not supporting him in the election.\nWow, the ratings are in and Arnold Schwarzenegger got \"swamped\" (or destroyed) by comparison to the ratings machine, DJT. So much for….\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2017 \n\nbeing a movie star-and that was season 1 compared to season 14. Now compare him to my season 1. But who cares, he supported Kasich & Hillary\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2017 \n\nThe two men have been going back and forth for nearly a month, but the argument reached a boiling point when, following Trump’s jab at the National Prayer Breakfast, Schwarzenegger said he and the president should “ switch jobs .”\n“You take over TV because you’re such an expert in ratings, and I take over your job and then people can finally sleep comfortably again,” he said in a video posted to Facebook, continuing the argument.\nTrump, equally unable to let it go, took to Twitter yet again on Friday to slam Schwarzenegger for doing a “really bad job” as California’s Republican governor and an “even worse” job hosting the “Celebrity Apprentice.”\n“But at least he tries hard,” the president added.\nIn any event, Schwarzenegger has been pleased with his responses to Trump’s attacks, telling Men’s Journal that he sounds better than the commander in chief.\n“I sound more presidential and more diplomatic and more elder-statesman — that’s exactly the way Donald should be,” he said.\nSchwarzenegger also blasted Trump’s controversial executive order instituting a 120-day freeze on the refugee resettlement program and a 90-day ban on entry into the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority countries.\nThe former two-term governor called the action “crazy” and said it “makes us look stupid.”\nOver the weekend, a federal judge issued a restraining order , halting the implementation of the White House’s travel ban. The Trump administration has vowed to fight the judge’s order.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T05:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:35:22.293+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
