Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email Theresa May appeared horrified by the concept of schoolchildren building robots out of Lego during a visit to Copeland today.\nThe Prime Minister recoiled in revulsion as primary school pupils demonstrated their ability to fashion rudimentary automatons out of the toy building blocks.\nShe was visiting the school ahead of a crucial by-election in the region, to take place next week.\nDuring the visit, the PM refused to say whether she opposed plans to scrap or downgrade the maternity ward in a local hospital.\nBut it's possible she was simply preoccupied by the tiny wheeled mechanoids.\nWhat could possibly have been running through her mind?\nOh, this seems harmless enough (Photo: Getty Images Europe) But hang on a minute... (Photo: PA) How many of these things have you made? (Photo: PA) The unemployment figures are bad enough without introducing robots to the workforce (Photo: Getty Images Europe) And if small children can build them, what's stopping corporations building them? (Photo: PA) Oh, that kind of thing never ends well... (Photo: BBC) (Photo: Newcastle Chronicle) My God...what if they build one that can replace ME?
