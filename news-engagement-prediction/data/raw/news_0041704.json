So of course people on Twitter wouldn't be able to contain themselves when pictures of Ivanka Trump appearing to swoon over dreamboat Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appeared. \nPhotos of the two, who were both part of a roundtable discussion about women in the workforce (whether this occurred before or after that awkward handshake is unclear) during Trudeau's meeting with President Trump, quickly went viral. And the internet set-to causing some mischief. SHARE Eyes for him only ... Ivanka Trump and Justin Trudeau.

Remember that time the Duchess smiled up at him through her glossy hair? My favourite photo genre is \"married women meeting Justin.\" pic.twitter.com/XBsLL8Ws4w — Blair Elliott (@blairelliott) February 13, 2017 Advertisement \nAnd we get it. So does Trevor Noah, who had a lot of fun with the pictures on Wednesday's The Daily Show, pointing out that since moving to Washington Ivanka sure has had to hang out with a lot \"alt-handsome\" guys. \nNoah also made a point of the photo that Ivanka shared to her Instagram that showed her sitting in the Oval office flanked by her father and Trudeau. A post shared by Ivanka Trump (@ivankatrump) on Feb 13, 2017 at 2:35pm PST \nThe photo has attracted some criticism given that Ivanka has been involved in official events but doesn't have a formal role at the White House. \nThough perhaps the most warranted criticism is this from The Daily Show's Trevor Noah: \"Oh, I'm sorry, that photo shows the importance of women having a seat at the table? Your dad let you sit at his desk\" said Noah. \"That's not a woman in power, it's take-your-daughter-to-work day. No I mean, don't get me wrong, it's a lovely Instagram photo. I think she probably used the 'nepotism' filter.\" \n\"And what makes this really annoying is 3 million more Americans wanted a woman sitting behind that desk full-time, not just for the photo op.\" \nIn any case, Ivanka swooning over Trudeau might make her more \"relatable,\" something that her \"personal brand\" sure could do with right about now .
