During a meeting with health insurers, Trump said a replacement plan would be unveiled soon. \"We have a plan that I think is going to be fantastic. It's going to be released fairly soon,\" Trump said Monday. \"I think it's going to be something special ... I think you're going to like what you hear.\" But he told the CEOs that if the plan doesn't accomplish his goals, they'd face his ire. \"If things don't work out I'm blaming you anyway,\" he said.
