Google product manager Crystal Cee, in a product Quote: : “We’ve gotten reports about some users being signed out of their accounts unexpectedly. We’re investigating, but not to worry: there is no indication that this is connected to any phishing or account security threats.”\nCee added that Google is continuously investigating the issue and asked users who face the issue, to sign back in the account again, at accounts.google.com. She said that if some users use the two-step verification process to log into their Gmail accounts, they could face some problem in getting the SMS code which is required. In that case, Cee asks such users to try again or use a backup code. Google even explained the same in a statement to Android Central. Meanwhile, in the forum, there are several complaints, related to the Gmail login issue but if they are directly in relation to the issue identified by Google, remains to be seen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T01:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:27:48.419+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
