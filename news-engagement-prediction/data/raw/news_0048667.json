But the Frenchman said he is more immediately concerned about how to combat Sutton’s artificial playing surface.\n“Firstly, the pitch,” said Wenger when asked what are the biggest dangers facing his team. “Secondly, their enthusiasm. Thirdly if we are not ready for a big fight. Subconsciously if we think ‘no matter, it’s a non-league team, we will pass’, that will not happen. Ideally we would like to play on a normal pitch. But it has been accepted so … competition is also about dealing with what you face. We face an artificial pitch and we have to deal with it.”\nArsenal’s players have practised on a 3G pitch at their London Colney training ground this week, although Wenger believes they will face a different challenge against the club who saw off Coventry at the same venue in 1989.\n“It’s not the same because it’s a dry pitch and I’ve heard that Sutton have a wet pitch, they water it before the game so it’ll be much quicker,” he said. “It means the weight on the joints is stronger, you cannot glide, you have to block every time so it makes football a bit different because the ball comes to you and somebody accelerates and doesn’t slow down like in a normal game so you have to get used to the difference in speed.”\nDanny Welbeck has confirmed he will not feature in the tie against Sutton as he continues his return from injury due to fears over the pitch. The England striker played for Arsenal’s Under-23 side on Sunday but admitted he did not want to risk himself on the unusual surface. “Glad to get 70 minutes today to build up my match fitness. Plastic pitch at Sutton isn’t the best idea at the moment,” he tweeted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T00:51:33.596+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
