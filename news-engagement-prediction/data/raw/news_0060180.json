Deepika Padukone NOT attending the Oscars 2017 By Zee Media Bureau | Last Updated: Thursday, February 23, 2017 - 18:54 0 Follow @ZeeNews \nNew Delhi: Bollywood stunner Deepika Padukone is making waves at a global level and certainly there's no denying it. The diva' maiden Hollywood film 'xXx: Return of Xander Cage' opposite Vin Diesel has minted huge moolah across the globe and continues its magical spell at the box office windows. \nThere was a strong rumour that Deepika might be walking the red carpet at Oscars 2017. However, the gorgeous actress has denied it. PTI quotes her speaking at the launch of Gillette Venus Breeze where Dippy darling was asked if she is attending the Academy Awards this year to which she said, \"That's an interesting question.... But no, no.\" MUST READ Deepika Padukone to walk the red carpet at Oscars 2017? \nShe added, \"For me, what was really heartening was the way India embraced the film. I think just the way everyone embraced my performance, even the way I spoke in the film, that makes me really happy. To step out of your comfort zone and work in a territory that you're absolutely unfamiliar with and not knowing what the end result might be, then to see that translate into this kind of love and appreciation, it makes me feel like it's worth taking all of those risks.\" \nBesides Deepika, Soha Ali Khan and Neha Dhupia too were present at the event. \nWhen asked if there is a pressure on celebrities to always look good, Deepika said, \"I think it depends from individual to individual. A lot of people have a different way of handling it. I wouldn't say there is pressure, but expectations, yes. There is a lot of expectation from everyone to look a certain way.\" \n\"For me it doesn't really matter. If I've had a long flight and I look great, then good, if I don't that's also ok. It's totally ok to not have great days, to not feel your best or have low days. You've to allow yourself that much and not be hard on yourself,\" she added. \nNeha, who was also asked the same, quipped, \"Everyday (I feel the pressure). Specially when I scroll my Instagram feed and suddenly Deepika's picture pops out. It's the worst feeling in the world. And Soha's too.\" \n(With PTI inputs) First Published: Thursday, February 23, 2017 - 18:54 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T07:28:11.472+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
