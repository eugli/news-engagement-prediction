They married in 1987 and have one daughter.\nShe said it took her several years to forgive her husband for what his act of infidelity, which happened while on an eight month trip in Brazil some 15 years ago.\nBut Mrs Reed-Hall forgave her husband after he convinced her it was just a one-off incident.\nShe said: 'My husband had a brief affair when he was working away eight months a year.\n'These things happen - I know loads of people who were married and not together after they had affairs or split up - but we are still together.\n'It was just once. But sadly he was away from home and stressed and a lot of other things were going on.\n'I always thought it could be on the cards and I was actually surprised it didn't happen earlier. But these things happen - and that was how we got it.\n'He did not tell me as he did not want to lose me, so I didn't know he was infected.\n'People think what an awful man he must be - they say \"you are a victim and a silly woman who trusts someone.\"\n'No, I am not. I am the complete opposite from a silly woman who does not know reality. But that is my story. It can happen to anybody.\n'People forget that everyone has sex - lots of men and woman have affairs in marriage - it is a fact in life - this happens all the time.\n'But this all diverts from the real issue - we all have sex, we all take risks and a lot of people are still not taking precautions.'\nMrs Reed-Hall was a youth worker for 30 years and worked on campaigns in the late 1980s and early 1990s to raise awareness of HIV and Aids.\nNow retired, she also worked as a lecturer at Cornwall College.\nShe said doctors were initially dubious and failed to believe the couple could have HIV.\nMrs Reed-Hall forgave her husband's infidelity, despite having to live with the stigma attached to having HIV\nShe said: 'I was laughed at and told I was being over-cautious.'\nBut the couple must now take strong medication every day for the rest of their lives and face multiple health problems.\nThe virus HIV attacks the immune system and can cause Aids, where patients are open to attack from other illnesses such as kidney failure or pneumonia.\nMrs Reed-Hall, who believes she is the only woman living openly with HIV in Cornwall, has decided to open up about her story to raise awareness of the need for testing and help shed some of the stigma.\nShe says people in her home village of Porkellis, near Helston, are still afraid that she could pass on the virus and she struggles to avoid being defined by her illness.\nShe said: 'I do feel lonely. It's very hard to know whether it's related to HIV. I think it is in part.\n'I had a big social life, quite a lot of friends. I don't know if they disappeared because I announced that I had HIV - all I know that my life changed the day I was open about it.\n'I have suffered abuse but not necessarily from people I know. I've been told not to be self-pitying. I'm quite isolated - very few people understand what it's like to live with this except online which is why I am online.\n'I should not feel any shame. Why should I?\n'I don't want my husband to feel any shame either. He was just unlucky and we are still together. But it does make you ashamed. Just to say you have HIV, you are saying you have sex.\n'Sex and death don't go together very well.\n'It's not abuse it's apathy - not wanting to know me. That in essence is the stigma. I'd like the stigma to end so I could have some more friends.'\nMr Reed-Hall, a retired military engineer, said he still carries around a strong sense of guilt for what he did - and said although they never separated it took several years for his wife to fully forgive him for what he did.\nHe added: 'We support each other - she is more of a campaigner and I have always been the quiet one.\n'I was the one who got it, so I have always got a feeling of guilt.\n'It was a long time ago and although we didn't separate it has taken a long time for her to fully forgive me.\n'It took a few years but I know she doesn't blame me now.\n'Anyone can get it - you don't have to be that promiscuous. It only happened once and I have felt the guilt of it ever since.'\nMrs Reed-Hall added: 'It took me five or six years to forgive him. The first year he was very ill and was hospitalsed. I effectively had to be his nurse. I did not have time to think about myself.\n'I could see him dying in front of my eyes - but I am a realist and he was a seaman working away half his life. I knew it was possible.\n'It is almost an occupational hazard. The next few years after were awful though. I kept thinking 'why did he do it?'\n'But I understand totally why. Most people have not been married as long as we have.\n'He only did it once. I am not stupid and now he can tell me anything. I know he was just stupid. But sadly once is sometimes all that is takes.\n'I was very angry -there is no denying that. I was not unfaithful although I had plenty of offers.\n'But he has been a lot more faithful than a lot of other men I know.\n'He was unfaithful on just one trip. I actually think now that that was pretty good going as the temptation for seaman is everywhere.\n'I think we are now stronger than ever and we support each other through it all.'", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T16:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T11:39:20.249+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
