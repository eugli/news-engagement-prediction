Take the fangs out,\" she explained. \"I think it's always been a part of the diet, the bugs, but then I think there is a truth to the survival during the war of course. When people were being starved they were able to survive on things like this and they did.\" \nSTORY: Inspired by Angelina?

The 41-year-old appeared confident preparing the bugs before cooking them in a frying pan while her children watched on. \"You want to share a spider?\" she asked Shiloh, who joined her mum in tucking into a tarantula. \"It's actually really good the flavour,\" Angelina mused, before saying that the scorpions tasted \"like tasteless chips\". \nVIEW GALLERY Angelina appeared confident in preparing and eating the local delicacies \nThe clip was part of Angelina's interview with BBC World News, where she spoke publicly about her split from Brad Pitt for the first time.
