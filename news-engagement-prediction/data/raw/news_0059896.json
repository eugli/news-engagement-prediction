From Stan Lee 's regular appearances in every single Marvel adventure to the Bluth Company stair car in Civil War 's now iconic airport sequence, Marvel directors have never shied away from including obscure references to pop culture icons. Now it appears that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 will be no different in that regard. We still have a few months left until James Gunn 's sci-fi sequel hits theaters, but it now seems that iconic heavy metal frontman and filmmaker Rob Zombie may have a cameo in the film. Check out Zombie's Instagram post below to see for yourself. A post shared by RobZombieofficial (@robzombieofficial) on Feb 22, 2017 at 6:12pm PST \nRob Zombie posted the above Instagram photo last night, and it seems that he's joining the production of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 in an unspecified cameo role. The caption of the photo specifically mentions that he's involved in the film for a voiceover part, which leads us to believe that his gravelly vocals will be suitably applied to a gruff looking alien at some point during the movie. \nIt's worth acknowledging that Rob Zombie has made a cameo in this franchise before. He lent his voice to a Ravager during the events of the original Guardians of the Galaxy , so we won't be shocked if that same character makes another appearance as a member of Yondu's (Michael Rooker) group. That said, as this cameo will be in the form of a voiceover, it's entirely possible that Zombie may have an entirely new role in this film. We will have to wait and see. \nConsidering Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 's ability to keep most of its secret intact so far, it seems highly likely that we may not know who Rob Zombie specifically portrays in the film until it finally hits theaters. Then again, we didn't even notice his cameo the first time around, so we might have to look extra hard just to catch it. It isn’t a James Gunn film without @RobZombie ’s voice!! https://t.co/wv8SM6c177 — James Gunn (@JamesGunn) February 23, 2017 \nOne thing that's also worth thinking about is Rob Zombie's music, and how that might be applied to the Guardians sequel. Rob Zombie has become one of the most iconic metal frontmen of the last few decades, and music has always played a significant role in the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise. It seems unlikely that Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) would ever put a Rob Zombie song on one of his Awesome Mixes, but I would not be terribly surprised to hear some of his music during the film. Honestly, Drax (Dave Bautista) would probably love it. \nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 will blast its way into theaters later this year on May 5. \nCheck out a trailer for the upcoming Guardians of the Galaxy sequel on the next page for an even closer look at the next adventure for Marvel's favorite band of cosmic misfits!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:38:25.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
