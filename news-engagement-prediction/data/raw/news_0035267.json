Lemercier are producing. \nThe Purge series is set in a near future America where once a year there is a 12-hour period where all crime, including the most insane acts of murder, are legal. The first movie was a contained thriller that starred Ethan Hawke and made a very healthy $64.4 million on a $3 million budget. By the time of last year’s installment, Election Year, the story had expanded into a battle for America’s political future; the producers still kept the budget low — $10 million — and the movie, which starred Frank Grillo, grossed almost $80 million. The movie was also timely in its political overtones. Borys Kit", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T04:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:24:46.683+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
