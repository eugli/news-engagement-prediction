Last week, Budweiser released an ad about their founder, who immigrated from Germany of the United States in the 1800s, and today during the big game, Coca-Cola joined the beer company in their celebration of the U.S. as a nation of immigrants. Coca-Cola, however, did not debut a brand new commercial, instead opting to re-run one from Super Bowls past. The TV spot titled \"It's Beautiful\" appeared in the first moments of Super Bowl 2017. It features people of varying races, genders, ethnicities, ages and religions engaged in different activities in locations all over the U.S. The montage is set to a version of \"America the Beautiful,\" sung in many different languages including English, Spanish, Keres, Tagalog, Hindi, Senegalese French and Hebrew.

The 'Together Is Beautiful' Coca-Cola ad aired during the Rio 2016 Olympics, and prior to that, during the 2014 Super Bowl. It features the song 'America the Beautiful' being sung in many different languages. Naturally, the commercial brought a mix of reactions, namely from 'English-speaking' crowds.\" As the beverage company seems to reference, when the ad was first released, some were not pleased that Coke chose to feature the patriotic song in languages other than English. It seems the ad sparked similar controversy today, as some took to Twitter to complain about the commercial using the hashtag #BoycottCoke . On Sunday, the company tweeted, \"Today millions cheer together, because together is beautiful.\" We couldn't agree more. Here's to the glass of Coke Zero we're downing right now. #", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T07:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T03:20:39.678+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
