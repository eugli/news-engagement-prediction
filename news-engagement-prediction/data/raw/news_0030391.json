The sandwich, which consists of stock-drenched ham hock, crispy shoestring chips, a decadent fried egg, vibrant piccalilli, and plenty of malt vinegar mayo to cut all that unctuous fat, happens to be the first Halley ever created for his North London restaurant, Max’s Sandwich Shop . \nHalley takes all the best Britain has to offer and ties it together in one elegant bundle that could easily rival New York’s pastrami sandwich or Montreal’s smoked meat sandwich. As he told us previously, “There, within all of those things, layered up in the right order, was a classic pub lunch.” RECIPE: Ham, Eggs, and Chips Sandwich \nSo just why did Halley—who cut his teeth at the likes of Brindisa, LeCoq, Arbutus, and the Salt Yard—dive headfirst into the world of sandwiches? “I felt that the sandwich in Britain needed a bit of help, so I tried to put as much culinary effort into making a sandwich as most people would put into a restaurant main course.” \nWhile we certainly aren’t quick to condone upsetting the elderly, this is definitely a sandwich worth committing acts so repugnant, they would rock your grandmother to her wizened core. \nNow that’s a promise worth making a sandwich over.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T19:11:42.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
