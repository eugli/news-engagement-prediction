RIGHT: John Kariuki \nA gracious offer by Youth and Gender Affairs Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki to meet a jobless university graduate has drawn the ire of Kenya’s Twitterati. \nThe criticism centered on the now familiar pattern of government officials meeting and offering job opportunities only to those whose plight has been highligted on media. \nJohn Kariuki, a Biotechnology graduate from Kenyatta University, settled for menial jobs in Nairobi after a fruitless search for employment. \nMr Kariuki was orphaned at a young age but he got a scholarship for his secondary school education at Starehe Boys Centre from where he attained a mean grade of A minus. His story was aired on NTV . \nThe story moved cabinet secretary, who took to twitter and invited the man. Following the @ntvkenya feature on youth unemployment and on John Kariuki a graduate biotechnologist, I have asked to meet the young man pic.twitter.com/wJxIcropoa \n— CS Sicily Kariuki (@SicilyKariuki) February 20, 2017 \nHer tweet did not go down well with Kenyans, many asking if being featured on television is the only way for the millions of unemployed youths to get employed. @SicilyKariuki do you have to be on TV to get a job. There are many like him that need jobs.
