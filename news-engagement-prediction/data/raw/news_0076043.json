Both phones will only be initially available in the Asia Pacific and Europe, including Russia, Japan, and Germany. Let’s check out the specs:\nBlade V8 Mini: \nZTE Snapdragon 435 processor Android N 13-megapixel / 2-megapixel dual rear camera system Rear fingerprint sensor 5-inch HD screen 2GB RAM with 16GB storage 2,800 mAh battery Micro USB; headphone jack Blade V8 Lite: \nZTE MediaTek 6750 processor Android N 8-megapixel rear-facing camera, 5-megapixel front-facing camera Rear fingerprint sensor 5-inch Full HD screen 2GB RAM with 16GB storage 2,500mAh battery Micro USB; headphone jack The Mini’s super cute! That red color (pictured above) reminds me slightly of the spunky iPhone 5C colors. The Mini also features a similar dual camera system to the V8 Pro, but at a cheaper price, which is cool. But really what’s commendable here is that ZTE is launching these devices with Android N. Good job, ZTE.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T11:02:10.185+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
