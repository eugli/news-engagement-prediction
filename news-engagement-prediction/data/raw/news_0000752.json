Spicer's response? \"To assume that just because of someone's age or whatever that they don't pose a threat would be wrong,\" he said. \nSpicer, asked about 5 yr-old: \"To assume that just b/c of someone's age or gender or whatever that they don't pose a threat would be wrong Predictably, Twitter erupted in outrage at what Spicer seemed to be implying: that 5-year-olds can be capable of terrorism, and should be held to the same level of scrutiny as full-grown adults. \nDid Sean Spicer just defend holding that 5-year-old child apart from his mom. At the airport bc of this stupid ban?! I'm done... \nI think Sean Spicer just said that one shouldn't assume a 5-year-old kid doesn't pose a threat. (You know, 'cause who are his parents?) \nSean Spicer just said it would be misguided to assume a 5-year old isn't a (terrorist) threat. Is he tied to a dirty bomb? No? Not a threat. On Friday, Trump signed an executive order halting the admittance of refugees and immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries into the U.S. On Saturday, a 5-year-old U.S. citizen and Maryland resident was finally reunited with his mother — who is from Iran — after being detained for several hours at Washington D.C.'s Dulles International Airport, WJLA reported. Prior to the boy's release, his mother pled to Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe for help, according to WJLA. The boy's reunion with his mother was captured by reporters in an emotional video. Turns out children aren't the future, after all. In Spicer's opinion, they could be terrorists.
