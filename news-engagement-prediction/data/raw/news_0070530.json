(It probably helps, after all, that he has “the best words.”) So it comes as no surprise that when Donald Trump visited the National Museum of African American History and Culture this week, he unleashed some utterances that will not soon be forgotten. Stephen Colbert, for his part, wanted to highlight a few of them for his viewers. According to witnesses , when met with a stone auction block used to sell slaves, the president apparently said, “Boy, that is just not good. That is not good.” Cracked Colbert, “I haven’t heard that kind of eloquent enunciation since the Civil War novel, The Red Badge of Dang, That Is Messed Up!. ” The second eyewitness quote led to something a little more vicious—a punchline so harsh, in fact, that the crowd could only groan in response. “Later, they came upon a set of shackles used to restrain children, and the president said, ‘That is really bad. That is really bad,’“ Colbert said, before hammering Trump even harder: ”Adding, ‘Chains on a kid? What is this, the airport?’” Colbert wasn’t the only host tackling this topic Wednesday night. Seth Meyers told a joke of his own about the president’s visit during a news roundup , quipping, “President Trump today said that he very much enjoyed his trip to the African American Museum of History and Culture yesterday. Said one employee, ‘Sir, that was a basketball game.’” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:37:21.844+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
