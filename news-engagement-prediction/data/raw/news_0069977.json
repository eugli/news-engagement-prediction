Their spouses and children aged below 21 will be entitled to a medical cover that includes treatment outside the country. \nA retiring deputy governor will also get a four-wheel-drive car not exceeding 3.4cc engine capacity. \nUpon the the death of a retired governor or a deputy governor, his family will be entitled to 50 per cent of their pension and a house allowance of 23 per cent of their current monthly salary. All retired MCAs and former councillors will be paid Sh50,000 per month. \nIn a statement, Kenan Miruka, the county deputy director of communications, said the bill would be presented to the governor who would consider its merits before acting on it as prescribed by law. \n\"While it is healthy to debate the proposal by Members of the County Assembly regarding retirement benefits, we should not put the cart before the horse. Let us avoid innuendo and not politicise the issue,\" he said. \nA report of the joint departmental Committee on Culture, Sports and Community Social Services and Budget proposed seeking expert advice from the Retirement Benefits Authority, Salaries and Remuneration Commission and the Controller of Budget.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T12:04:58.699+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
