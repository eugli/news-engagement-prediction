Stellalevi for Getty Images By Michele Boyer Updated June 01, 2016 . \nRVing is becoming one of the most popular ways to travel. But a successful and safe RV trip takes preparation and planning to make it a good experience. Whether you are new to RVing or not, these tips can help ensure that your trip will be problem-free. 1. Learn How to Drive the RV You Plan to Use If you are vacationing in an RV for the first time, practice driving first. If you don’t own your RV, then rent one for a day. Try several types of RV to see how they compare.Driving a motor home, or pulling an RV, has more in common with driving a commercial big-rig truck than you might realize. Keeping the RV between the lines, accelerating, braking, using only mirrors to see what’s behind you, watching tires in motion, and passing vehicles just top the list of maneuvers that handle very differently from a car, SUV or pickup. And DO get plenty of practice backing your RV up so that you can back into a campsite. 2. RV Insurance and Road Service \ncontinue reading below our video Tipping Etiquette Around the World \nMake sure your insurance covers every aspect of your RV trip. Be sure to research road services that specialize in RVs. Only a few road service companies will tow the trailer, too. You don’t want to leave all of your possessions in a trailer on the side of the road. Does your auto insurance cover your trailer? Does your motor home policy cover your towed vehicle? Do you need separate RV insurance or road service coverage? Will your insurance cover towing your motor home, your truck AND trailer, or will they leave your trailer behind? How far will they tow you? \nA 25-mile tow in New England will probably get you to a safe place, but a 25-mile tow in a Western state would just get you a change of scenery. \n3. Reservations Confirm your reservations when you are within a couple hours of your stop. You may be stuck if you arrive after the office closes unless your campground has 24-hour check in.Keep a list of nearby campgrounds . It’s maddening when reservations get lost. But if the campground is full when you arrive, or if you can’t get there due to weather or bad road conditions, you’ll be glad you have a list of alternative RV parks on hand .Call as soon as possible if you are not going to make it to your reservation. Not only is it courteous, but you might prevent a night’s camping from being charged to your card. 4. Check Road Conditions, Construction and Closures Truckers have a saying: “There are only two seasons, winter and construction.” If you’re traveling in an RV, plan on running into construction.Save time and frustration by checking one of several websites that report road conditions, closures and construction. The US DOT Federal Highway Administration website shows a map of the states. Click on the state you will be traveling in and choose a link that shows current road conditions. 5. Weather There is little we can do about weather but adapt. Knowing the weather forecast can help avoid problems. Rain, snow, ice, hail, wind–any of these can ruin your trip. Below are just a few weather sites that give weather for all states.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T18:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:19:21.336+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
