When his friend Alfredo Lopez asked him what was his “favorite song of the moment,” he answered that he fancied “Starboy,” The Weeknd’s record-breaking tune last year. \n“Oh, s**t, that was funny,” Bieber’s friend blurted out, to which Bieber responded, “We gotta end it now, you all…that was too funny.” In another comic clip, 22-year-old Bieber stretched his legs while listening to “Starboy.” A post shared by Justin Bieber Updates™ (@justinbiebertracker) on Feb 12, 2017 at 8:25pm PST \nHe was nominated for the Grammy’s for Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance for his acoustic track “Love Yourself,” and Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album for Purpose. \nThe Weeknd is currently dating singer-actress Selena Gomez, who was Bieber’s former flame for two years. Gomez and The Weeknd were sighted hanging out in Italy and photographed smooching outside an Italian restaurant in California recently. \nLast month, TMZ reported that Bieber threw plenty of shade at his fellow Canadian, emphasizing that he could not “swallow” his rap songs. “Hell no, I can’t listen to a Weeknd song,” Bieber told the news site. “That s**t’s whack.” Gianna Francesca Catolico RELATED STORIES", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T08:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:04:30.777+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
