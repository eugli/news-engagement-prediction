Update (February 14, 2017, 2:10 P.M.): Fashionista.com editor-in-chief Alyssa Vingan Klein tweeted Monday evening that seating at the New York Library Phillip Plein show was limited because no editors present wanted to sit next to Tiffany Trump . \nhttps://twitter.com/alyssavingan/status/831332726124994565 On Tuesday, Trump's friend Andrew Warren posted a photo of himself with Trump at the Phillip Plein show, with a note on the topic of that empty seat. “Me and my best #lastnight at @philippplein78 @philipppleininternational,” he wrote in his caption. “(ps. That seat was never empty it was reserved for [Plein’s] family).” The original article continues below. Former First Daughter Chelsea Clinton and current First Daughter Tiffany Trump are experiencing very different sides of New York Fashion Week. Clinton attended friend Tanya Taylor’s show on Friday, where the Daily Front Row reported that she slid in discreetly with her publicist and went largely unnoticed by the crowd. Meanwhile, Trump and her mother, Marla Maples, were joined by a full Secret Service detail when they attended a show for Chinese designer Taoray Wang, who designed Trump’s inauguration coat and dress, on Saturday, per Page Six. Trump told The Hollywood Reporter she would be attending a few more N.Y.F.W. events, although Page Six reported Thursday that she failed to make it into a party where a man with a “Fuck Trump” jacket demanded attention. Trump has been a presence at New York Fashion Week in the past, but not for sitting on the sidelines surrounded by heavy security. She \"walked\" in her friend Drew Warren’s show in February 2016, an event that made minor headlines while her father was making his way through the Republican primary. Clinton’s past involvement in Fashion Week has mostly been limited to fund-raisers for her mother’s campaign. In September 2016, she co-hosted the Made for History fashion show with Anna Wintour and Huma Abedin . But Clinton isn't leaving politics behind even with both of her parents out of office, tweeting her support for the Council of Fashion Designers of America's collaboration with Planned Parenthood. “I don’t think we have an option to stay calm these days,” she told the Daily at Taylor’s show. Tiffany Trump has not yet tweeted about Fashion Week. 1 / 16 Ivanka and Tiffany Trump’s Half-Sister Act A ringletted, towheaded, toddler Tiffany Trump drew both of her parents’ attention in New York City.
