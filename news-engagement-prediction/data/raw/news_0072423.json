ADVERTISEMENT \nA day after his trade to the New Orleans Pelicans was finalized, the volatile center paid tribute to the team that drafted him fifth overall in 2010. \nREAD: Cousins joins Davis in New Orleans after multi-player deal \n“Words can’t even express how hard it is for me to have to leave the city of Sacramento and all of the amazing people that I have met while out here,” Boogie captioned a photo of himself on his personal Instagram page. \n“I gave it my all for you and you gave it right back. The most amazing fans on the planet and I just want you to know that your support has meant everything to me. It’s hard to believe that it was seven years ago that this young kid from Alabama showed up in Sacramento scared and not knowing a soul. As I look back upon my time here, I wouldn’t trade it for anything,” he wrote. \nDespite the constant discord he had with the Sacramento brass throughout his stay, Cousins voiced out his apparent love for the city and its people. \n“I have met so many amazing people, many of whom went out of their way to make me feel right at home from day one. Each and every one of you have played such an important part in my life and helping me become the person I am today. I don’t just consider you all as fans, you all are my family…and a couple thousand miles aren’t going to change a thing. Thank you Sacramento,” he ended his post, along with the hashtag #LoyaltyisLove. \nMeanwhile, in a separate clip uploaded by a Kings fan on Twitter, the three-time All-Star was seen holding back his tears in an emotional speech in front of fans and members of the media. \nMy friend got transferred to another city because of his job. He had some things to say. Rough to watch. pic.twitter.com/iBRyMf1UP7 \n— Carmichael Dave (@CarmichaelDave) February 21, 2017 “My love for this city will never change. Even though I’m gone it’ll still be the same,” the often temperamental big man said, while giving a tearful farewell. Cousins, meanwhile, will play his first game in a Pelicans uniform against the Houston Rockets on Friday (Saturday in Manila).
