The Home button is positioned at the bottom of the display, which would allow users to quickly access the phone screen. Apparently, Samsung will be replicating functionality it already has on several of its phones by allowing users to press hard on the Home button’s position (with the display off) to turn the phone on or double tap it to launch the phone’s camera. \nLeaks which highlights on-screen navigation buttons may seem a bit drab, but they are actually quite important. Samsung isn’t the only Android OEM still building phones with physical and capacitive navigational buttons, but it definitely is the largest. It will be interesting to see how other Android manufacturers change their approach within the next year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:00:22.256+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
