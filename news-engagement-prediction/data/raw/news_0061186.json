Eat a Banana - Cramping may be due to deficient potassium in your body, grabbing a banana and eating it will increase your potassium level. Take a Lick of Salt - Another home remedy to ease cramp pain is to shake a portion of table salt (approximately the size of a dime) into the palm of your hand and lick it up. Salt can help replenish diminished electrolytes in you body. This remedy is popular because salt is readily available in any home, but if you have a sports drink with electrolytes such as Gatorade handy, chug-a-lug. Pinch Your Upper Lip - The quickest relief may be a pinch to your upper lip directly under your nostrils. Press firmly (not to hard) for 30 seconds to one minute until your leg muscle relaxes. Alternatively, pinch your lip by placing your thumb on the inside of your mouth under the lip and your index finger on the outer lip. Stretch and Walk - Stretch your legs out while pointing your toes toward your chin. If you are laying down getting upright and walking can help work out any cramping. Natural Product - Caleb Tree Farms has created an Amish tonic made from organic apple cider, natural ginger, and garlic juices. I've used this... it works! They also have a special formulated tonic that stops acid reflux. But, I believe the two formulas have the same ingredients. Actually, it might be just the label that is different. In fact, I have taken their leg cramp tonic to treat heartburn with success. \nBuy Proven Old Amish Formula Stops Leg & Foot Cramps in About One Minute from Amazon More Leg Cramp Remedies Shared by Readers: \nPickle Juice - I have leg cramps from the top of my leg going down to the middle of my calf. It does not have a tingling sensation like restless leg syndrome, it cramps and is hard to stand or walk. I was told drinking pickle juice works. ~Peggy \nPoint Toes to Nose - When I get cramp I just stretch my leg out and point my toes to my nose and it goes straight away. ~leanne \nMoist Towel Wrap - I wrap a hot moist towel around my calf and that takes the pain right away. Of course it's agony hopping around on one foot while you're finding a towel and waiting for the water to run hot. But once I get it on my leg, it works instantly. If only I could prevent them in the first place. ~Kakthy \nPreventative Measure - I keep a bar of any brand of soap at the foot of our bed between the sheets. It's a sure preventive for me!!! ~r robertson \nTeaspoon of Yellow Mustard for Leg Cramps - I have proven to myself and to some of my family and clients, that yellow mustard takes cramps away. Not the best tasting remedy but a very positive one. ~smclark33 \nKorean Fermented Cabbage - I had excruciatingly painful leg cramps every night. I noticed that when I ate kimchi (Korean fermented cabbage) the cramps would go away for days and if I got a cramp it was not as painful. Then I read that artificial sweeteners eliminate good bacteria in the gut, or interfere with absorption. When I eliminated all aspartame, saccharin and Splenda from my diet, the night cramps never came back and I sleep like a baby. There are many fermented foods, besides kimchi, such as sauerkraut and pickles. These foods add good micro-organism that help absorb and digest nutrients. Add fermented food to your diet and eliminate artificial sweeteners that may be interfering with absorption of minerals. Then you may also share in this miracle I am experiencing and sleep peacefully through the night. ~Madeleine \nTonic Water - I worked in a medical facility years ago and a doctor prescribed quinine tablets for relief of leg cramps, since then I have kept a continual supply of tonic water that contains quinine in the fridge. Both diet and regular work the same. Not only during the cramps but also preventive. I highly recommend quinine for leg muscle cramps and spasms. Knocks it right out! ~Iris \nNote: Please seek medical attention if you have persistent occurrences of leg and foot cramps.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:28:04.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
