Song as hosts discussing kid-friendly DC content including the Justice League Action , DC Super Hero Girls and Teen Titans Go! animated series, as well as exclusive reveals of future merchandise and toys based on DC properties. \nFuture episodes will include visits to Toy Fairs, San Diego Comic-Con and going behind-the-scenes at Warner Bros. Animation, as well as guides to DIY crafts, activities and interactive features to get viewers involved. \nIn a statement, Maryellen Zarakas, SVP Worldwide Franchise Management and Marketing, Warner Bros. Consumer Products called the new series \"a major part of our strategy to deliver original short form content for kids, while DCE's EVP Business & Marketing Strategy, Direct to Consumer & Global Franchise Management Amit Desai added, \"Following the success and popularity of DC All Access as the one-stop source for the latest DC Universe news, launching DC Kids is a natural next step to continue to grow our original content line-up, and to give fans, and particularly families, even more access and inside scoop on all things DC.\" \nDC Super Hero Girls , a push into girls' brands created in collaboration between DC Entertainment, Warner Bros. Consumer Products and Mattel, was named the Toy Industry Association's Toy of the Year in the action figure category earlier this week. \nDC Kids will launch March 3 on YouTube, DCKids.com, and on a newly launched Justice League Action mobile app. Graeme McMillan", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T02:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:12:06.651+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
