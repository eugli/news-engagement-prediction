NBA Australia \nPublished on Jan. 30, 2017 \nJan. 30, 2017 \nJanuary has been quite the month for the 76ers, and they made sure it ended in appropriate, winning fashion. \nThanks to a dramatic second-half turnaround, the Sixers surged to a 122-119 victory over the Sacramento Kings at The Center in the make-up of a game originally scheduled for Dec. 1 (AEDT). \nThe Sixers put up 74 points following intermission. \nArron Afflalo had an open look at a corner 3-pointer with time expiring, but the shot skimmed off the rim. The win gave the Sixers a 10-5 record for January, with seven of those triumphs having come in South Philadelphia. \nDown nine points, 73-64, five minutes into the third quarter, T.J. McConnell, one of the Sixers’ top performers since the calendar flipped to 2017, helped key a revitalizing push, leading his squad on a 26-12 tear to close the frame. \nAs the Sixers continued to add to their lead in the fourth period, going in front by as many as nine points, more energizing contributions rolled in from the likes of Robert Covington (23 pts, 10 reb) and Nerlens Noel (12 pts, 3 reb). \nThe Sixers survived an overpowering display from All-Star DeMarcus Cousins, who racked up 46 points (11-16 fg, 4-6 3fg, 20-22 ft) and 15 rebounds. He fouled out with 58.5 seconds to go. \nShortly before taking the floor Tuesday against the Sacramento Kings, the Sixers announced Joel Embiid (left knee contusion) would not only be held out of that night’s game, but that he was doubtful for Thursday's and Friday’s stops at Dallas and San Antonio, respectively, as well. \nBrett Brown doesn't consider the situation serious. \nT.J. McConnell revved up the Sixers after intermission. He tallied nine points (4-8 fg) and 11 assists. He has now posted at least 10 dimes in five of his last six games. \nSecond-year big man Willie Cauley-Stein provided productive first half relief for DeMarcus Cousins, and enjoyed a big night himself. Another former Kentucky Wildcat, Cauley-Stein deposited 17 points (8-10 fg).
