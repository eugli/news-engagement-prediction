He spent seven seasons as an offensive assistant at Texas Tech, his alma mater. Dykes joined Mike Leach's staff in 2000, the season after his dad left. \nThe 47-year-old Dykes will work with offensive coordinator Sonny Cumbie, who was a Texas Tech quarterback when Dykes was on the staff. Cumbie shared the title the past three seasons with Doug Meacham, who left for the same job at Kansas. \nTCU also hired Chris Thomsen as offensive line coach. \n___ \nMore AP college football: www.collegefootball.ap.org and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T09:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T04:59:44.513+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
