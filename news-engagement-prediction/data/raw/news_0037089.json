Really, that's all anyone seems to ask them, ever. So, of course the topic was broached when Dornan was on The Graham Norton Show in the UK, but this time, the conversation took a really entertaining, downright silly turn. \nNorton said that this installment is actually more romantic than the first, and Dornan agreed but said there is more sex this time around, too. (Whoohoo!) So, he preemptively broached the topic! Then, he explained a little bit of the process. \nWhen fellow guest Keanu Reeves asked him to clarify what kind of direction he gets on \"vocalization,\" Dornan explained, \"My temptation is always just to try to make Dakota laugh. So sometimes I'll do things like, when there's a moment where Iâ€™m meant to orgasm, I'll be like, 'do-do-do do do-do.' As in like a little trumpet noise. Ahahahaha. \nMore from CafeMom: Dakota Johnson & Jamie Dornan's On-Set Workouts Sound as Intense as Their Sex Scenes \nThe moment was genuinely so cute and funny. Check it out. Now, when you're watching those steamy sex scenes, this is totally going to pop into your head, and whoever you watch it with is may wonder why you're randomly laughing out loud at Christian and Ana getting it on. Ah well! The fact that they can laugh at themselves is refreshing. And admit it, Dornan's rando goofiness only serves to make him more attractive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:44:21.270+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
