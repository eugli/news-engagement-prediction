But I don’t understand. I feel like if Kaden had just had the medication he needed earlier he would be here today. \n“He had been so unwell for so long he never even complained from the pain, but he needed help. I was taking him to school - he was sitting through it and not complaining.

Kaden died of sepsis after years of suffering with arthritis (Photo: MEN Media) \nIn hospital for a week, he was discharged with a bottle of Calpol and Ibuprofen as well as vitamin D and iron tablets. \nBut the pain spread to Kaden’s knees then all his joints. \nReferred to Rheumatology at Blackpool, Caitlin claims they gave him more Calpol despite an ultrasound showing tissue damage. \nCaitlin told the Manchester Evening News : “It was worse in the morning, he couldn’t walk, he couldn’t even scratch his own nose his hands were so swollen and stiff. \n“We got referred to a physio - the therapist said I was doing too much for Kaden and that’s why he wasn’t able to do things himself. I felt like I was banging my head against a brick wall.” \nAt Blackpool Hospital, blood tests showed again showed that he was anaemic, despite the iron tablets. \nFinally, after months of delays, Kaden got an appointment at Alder Hey Hospital, where doctors were so shocked they suspected leukaemia. \nThey diagnosed systemic onset juvenile arthritis and started a course of steroids - which immediately began to ease his pain. \nBut the arthritis was already attacking Kaden’s joints and organs and he was placed on a high dependency unit.

I was just screaming at them to try.” Mum Caitlin Tattersall, 25, and dad Lee Hadfield, 29, are now awaiting an inquest this month (Photo: MEN MEDIA) \nKaden died the following day and medics told the family it was caused by sepsis as a result of his arthritis. \nCaitlin, who is training to be a social worker, added: “I want to know exactly what happened. \n\"I want everyone to know. How can a healthy boy go from having a sore ankle two years ago to being gone? \n“I’m training to be a social worker, I know what the standards should be. Why did it take so long to get a diagnosis? \nDescribing Kaden as loving, kind and caring, she added: “If he was in pain he would just entertain himself, play on his computer. When his friends came round Sometimes Kaden was too weak to play (Photo: MEN MEDIA) \nSometimes he was too weak to play with them. “I had to take him to school in a pram in the end, he didn’t like it, he said everyone would think he was a baby. \n“He was in agony every day and he never moaned. Everyone who ever met him loved him.” \nA spokesman for Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: “Our thoughts are with Kaden’s family at this sad time. Upon hearing of his death the trust initiated a case review which is ongoing and is standard procedure in all children’s deaths.” \nA spokeswoman for Alder Hey Children’s NHS Foundation Trust said: “Our thoughts remain with the family at this extremely difficult time.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:25:59.476+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
