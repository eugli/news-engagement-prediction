Besides, the company has also agreed to increase fares from the existing Rs 6 per km.\" \nAsked about the company's response on the union's claims, Ola said, \"No comment\". \nRathore said if the demands are not fulfilled by their employers by February 27, drivers will go on strike again. \nA senior government official said both the app-based aggregators have also invited the drivers to their office to discuss and resolve the issues peacefully. \nOn its part, the Delhi government has assured the drivers of their welfare particularly of those \"harassed\" without having been given an opportunity to be heard by the companies. \nOn the demand of removal of toll charges at borders, the government said it will take \"sympathetic\" view on it. The government will raise the issue with municipal corporation. \nAccording a senior government official, the companies assured drivers' union to work on their demands shortly and will give their assurance to the High Court on February 28, when it will hear drivers and the cab aggregators. \nCommuters in Delhi-NCR had to face hardship in booking cab as drivers of Ola and Uber had gone on indefinite strike in favour of their demands on February 10. \nHowever, the strike seemed to be losing steam over the last three days as most of striking union's members started plying their cabs.
