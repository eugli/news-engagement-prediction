It makes people worried about saying the wrong thing. ‘I very much doubt the situation will occur again, so it does not need to dealt with in this heavy-handed way. ‘Hospitals just need say to midwives that they can cause offence by assuming everyone in the room is in a heterosexual relationship.’ Councillor Tony Williams, leader of the Conservative opposition on Blackpool Council, added: ‘I am sorry these two young people were offended but I am sure (none) was intended. ‘I am sure it was an innocent remark made without any malice whatsoever.’ The hospital said the one-to-one lessons were provided at no extra cost to the taxpayer, but Mr Williams said he doubted this was true. Alec Shelbrooke, Tory MP for Elmet and Rothwell, West Yorkshire, said: ‘Midwives do an amazing job. They are under extreme pressure (and) saying \"you can’t do this\" and \"can’t do that\" adds to the burden' (stock image) The case was revealed in a report by Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust to NHS England and was published under its ‘Open and Honest Care: Driving Improvement’ scheme. The programme encourages hospitals to share ‘improvement data’ to promote good practice. The report, published in November, said: ‘A patient complained that she attended an antenatal class with her partner and the midwife hosting the class kept referring to the \"fella’s role\" during the labour process. ‘The patient is in a same sex relationship and felt this terminology was inappropriate and that same sex couples and single mothers could be made to feel uncomfortable by this reference. ‘The community midwives have been reminded not to use this terminology and only use the word ‘partner’ in future classes. ‘One to one parentcraft sessions have also been arranged for the couple as they felt uncomfortable returning to the class.’ A spokeswoman for Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: ‘All our midwifery care is individualised to the family’.
