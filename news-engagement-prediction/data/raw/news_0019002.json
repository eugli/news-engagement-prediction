That’s up from the city’s previous record of 70.5% set in 2015.\nLikewise, citywide dropout rates sunk to a record low of 8.5% in 2016, down from 9% in 2015.\nDe Blasio said the city’s improving grad rates show the schools are at the top of their game.\n“Our public schools are unquestionably the strongest they’ve ever been,” de Blasio crowed at a press conference to announce the new stats at the Bronx School for Law, Government and Justice.\n“We’ve believed in the promise of our public schools as the ladder to success for all New Yorkers, and we are raising the bar at every school,” he added.\nStatewide high school graduation rates for 2016 also released Friday echoed the gains shown by the city, reaching a record 81.4%, up from 79.4 % in 2015.\nBoth city and state grad rates have been climbing for the last dozen years or so. The gains follow a national trend as schools across the U.S. shift resources to ensure more students earn high school diplomas.\nCollege readiness rates for New York City also climbed in 2016 but trailed far behind graduation rates, with just 37.2% of students meeting City University of New York standards for incoming college freshmen.\nFour out of five CUNY community college students who graduated from city high schools in 2014 enrolled in remedial courses at CUNY in 2015.\nState education officials enacted a number of policy changes to loosen graduation requirements involving mandatory Regents exams in 2016.\nOne policy reduced the number of Regents exams students with disabilities needed to earn a diploma. Another enabled struggling students to seek an exemption if they failed a Regents exam but passed that subject’s course work.\nCity Education officials said that despite the changes, requirements for a diploma remained rigorous. But they would not say how many students used the new policies.\nEnglish-language learners in city schools posted a nine-point drop in their graduation rate in 2016 and an increased in dropout rate.\nEducation Department officials said that was because many ELL students tested out of the category by learning English, leaving a smaller group of needier students.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:42:37.167+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
