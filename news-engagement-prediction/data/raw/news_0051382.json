His debut LP Ghettos & Gardens set him apart from the flock as one of tech house's most daring producers, but it was his sophomore album Hello Clouds that cemented his place at the top of the crop. \nHello Clouds is a melodic, funky, day-dream of a journey into the mind and heart of a man who travels the world seeking the best grooves, the best dance floors, and the best pizza. It debuted at the top of iTunes and peaked at No. 15 on the Top Dance/Electronic Albums chart. It continues to enchant listeners around the globe months after its release, and today, Martin is excited to announce a 13-track remix package featuring reinterpretations of some of Hello Clouds ' most stand-out tracks by some of Martin's best friends. \nBillboard Dance is exclusively premiering Soul Clap 's deep house take on \"Midnight.\" Below you can read an exclusive Q&A with the remix artists conducted by Martin himself. You can also peep the full remix LP tracklist before it hits digital shelves Friday, Feb. 24. \nJustin Martin: Thank you guys for your absolutely STELLAR remix of “Midnight.” what is your favorite midnight snack? \nSoul Clap: Whether hard at work in the studio or getting deep on some television, midnight snacks are essential. The classic Oreo (Newman o’s these days) might lead the initiative, but then we move on to popcorn, mangos, clementine If the ice cream comes out, then things are gonna get crazy. \nY ou guys have lived in both B oston and NYC , both known for great pizza… which city overall has the best pizza, and can you give us your favorite spot in each? Pizza is a tough thing to really find the best, because sometimes it's all about how extravagant and crazy a slice of gourmet pizza is, and then another time it can be just how well a simple slice of bullshit pizza can satisfy. On Bedford Ave., Brooklyn Joe’s pizza opened recently, and that's got a heavy rep for NYC. In Boston, our homie and former business partner Sammy Sokol opened a spot on Newbury Street called Dirty Water Dough Co. Shout out to him. How's that for dodging the question. \nC ongrats on your latest album! I thoroughly enjoyed it! W hat do you find the biggest challenge and reward is in writing an entire album v er s us just singles? The best sign that an album in its entirety is done correctly is when there's really no stinkers and the whole thing flows together as one. It's a tricky thing to accomplish, a real challenge, but what a reward when you get to take it all in later and it works. \nHello Clouds Remix Package Tracklist \n1.
