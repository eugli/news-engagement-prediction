It’s not these organic uprisings that we’ve seen through the last several decades. The tea party was a very organic movement. This has become a very paid, Astroturf-type movement.” \nAmericans took to the streets for a second weekend on Saturday to protest President Donald Trump’s order, which has been temporarily suspended by a federal judge and is being reviewed by an appellate court . Anti-Trump gatherings were reported in Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Salt Lake City, St. Louis and outside the president’s resort in West Palm Beach, Florida, where he spent the weekend. \nLast week, thousands of people descended on the White House on Sunday afternoon for a rally followed by a march down Pennsylvania Avenue . Thousands more marched in cities and outside airports across the nation in protest of the order, which had caused families and refugees to be detained or otherwise prevented from entering the country. Hundreds of volunteer lawyers descended on airports to provide free legal services to those in need. \nIf someone had been able to organize a sustained nationwide protest that involved hundreds of thousands of people in dozens of cities and airports across the country, as Spicer claimed, that would certainly qualify as an extraordinary feat. \nTrump took a similar stance against the protesters last week. “Professional anarchists, thugs and paid protesters are proving the point of the millions of people who voted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” the president tweeted, after a protest at the University of California at Berkeley turned violent. \nA Republican member of Congress even found a way to use the same line. Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.) last week complained about the heat he was receiving back home in his district over his desire to repeal the Affordable Care Act. \n“There’s paid protesters ... paid activists on the far left, not my Democratic friends I go to church with. They’re being paid to go around and raise havoc,” Brat said after the town hall. \nBut there is danger in dismissing the significance of such protests (and bad poll numbers, as Trump did Monday ) outright. \nIn 2009, for example, Barack Obama press secretary Robert Gibbs took a stance similar to Spicer’s, referring to tea party-organized disruptions at Democratic congressional town halls as “Astroturf” and “manufactured anger.” \nWe all know how that turned out. \nHow will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?
