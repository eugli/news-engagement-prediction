Hey . Look, there’s fate, and then there’s Final Destination level of destiny from which there is no escape. I don’t want to say this guy had it coming, but there are forces of nature above us all that make these kinds of decisions. There is no way this was a random occurrence and not an act of God. This was just the Almighty overcompensating and trying to make his punishment a little too spontaneous. Also, there’s no way he should be sitting up after a minute or so, let alone still have his head connected to his body. The fact his head didn’t squash like a melon upon impact with the ground defies both physics and human anatomy. There should’ve been an explosion the likes of a Michael Bay movie on that pavement. \nBut good on him for, you know, not dying. Tires, man. The sneakiest bastards this side of chlamydia.
