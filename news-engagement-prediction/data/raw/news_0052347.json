Shortly after that, NPD was asked to temporarily halt the program, which they did. Chief Kasper was then invited to attend a follow-up meeting with members of the public to discuss 'High Five Fridays', which around 12 to 15 people attended. In a Facebook post, the department said: 'Concerns were shared that some kids might respond negatively to a group of uniformed officers at their school. People were specifically concerned about kids of color, undocumented children, or any children who may have had negative experiences with the police.' After the meeting, Chief Kasper and Superintendent John Provost decided to end 'High Five Fridays.' The concept involved police officers welcoming children to school and giving them high fives on Friday mornings before school started Chief Kasper said parents were informed about the events beforehand and children were never forced to participate. She said: 'It's a little bit frustrating for us to not be able to continue on with the program, quite honestly.' But she added: 'Certainly we do not want to have our officers at a school and have kids, even if it's a handful of kids, be traumatized and have a negative experience with our officers. 'That's the opposite of the goal we're trying to accomplish.' She noted that most of the response to the effort had been positive, but insisted the police needed to listen to those who felt otherwise. 'We are everyone's police. Not just the majority, and not just the minority', she said. Northampton, a western Massachusetts city of about 28,000 people, was estimated to be 87.1 percent white in 2015. The police department said the program 'may not seem controversial' but could not overlook the fact it may be received differently by some members of the community At a community meeting in January, one parent, Gina Nortonsmith, said the program had good intentions but was 'ill considered, tone-deaf and potentially damaging.' Another parent said: 'I think any concern raised by a parent when it comes to their kids' education and the surroundings there is valid.' However the overriding response to the department's Facebook post was critical of the school for scrapping the scheme. Marty Blair, a retired NPD officer, said: 'I am advocating that the High Five Fridays be brought back. This was a great way for our kids to interact with the NPD officers in a non- threatening way and establish a rapport that could last for many years.' Mary Jennison wrote: 'What a shame. Since when should children be encouraged to be afraid of police officers...this is a great way for children to learn the police are there to help them, to protect them.' Susan Farrell commented: 'So disagree with discontinuing this program. Totally the wrong approach. It is a positive and not a negative to interact in such an upbeat way.' Elizabeth Berger wrote: 'I am so sorry to hear that this amazing program stopped. It was exactly what the community - and all communities - need.' Since the idea was shelved, the department has been researching alternatives and encourages impromptu celebrations. Northampton police started 'High Five Friday' in December but it has now been scrapped Community policing efforts, with a focus on listening and building trust over the long term, was the brainchild of President Barack Obama in 2015 after multiple high-profile police confrontations. A string of fatal police shootings - from Baton Rouge, Louisiana to St Paul, Minnesota - has left many Americans demanding law enforcement reforms and greater accountability. The 'Black Lives Matter' motto was coined in 2013, but ignited when Michael Brown, 18, was fatally shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, in August 2014. That was followed by other high-profile killings of black men and boys by police in other American cities including Baltimore and Cleveland. The various shootings has sparked racial tensions and violent protests in the US about alleged disparities in policing.
