If you judge from the tens of thousands of families on waiting lists for charter schools and for scholarships in private schools it is apparent that poor families are desperate for someone who will fight for them for a change.\nUnfortunately, the media has reported on only one side of the DeVos story. All that's shown on nightly news and in the pages of daily newspapers are masses of teachers, administrators, city councilmen and retirees protesting her appointment with painted signs that are full of vitriol and lies. Just about everyone in the crowd has jobs and pensions at stake or are advocating for control of failing schools which they have not used for their own children.\nNot seen are the faces of the millions of families and students who have been the victims of bad education policy. They are not mobilized or represented in the crowds because they aren't organized by anti-reform forces and unions. All reporters need to do is a quick survey of where the protestors are coming from to realize that their stories are biased and hurtful to millions of poor families who do not want the failing public schools they have been forced to use for decades.\nDeVos is not anti-teacher or anti-public schools, but she is opposed to bad teachers and failing schools. No good teacher should fear a secretary of education who believes that only those closest to kids (teachers and parents) should have a say in how they are educated. But those who do feel threatened by policies that would close down failing schools are running out of time to head to the paint store and start making more anti-DeVos signs.\nJanine Yass is vice chair of the Center for Education Reform's board of directors. She founded the Boys' Latin Charter School in West Philadelphia. \nIf you would like to write an op-ed for the Washington Examiner, please read our guidelines on submissions here. \nAlso from the Washington Examiner Trump promises tax cuts, 'rudiments' of new healthcare plan by December President Trump was asked if the public can expect tax cuts in his first 11 months in office.\nBy Anna Giaritelli â€¢ 02/06/17 8:39 PM  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T04:10:32.803+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
