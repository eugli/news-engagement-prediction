There’s a circus tiger and a monkey, a double-crossing, a bomb, and no shortage of blood—and that's just in the first minute. \nWarning: It’s graphic—stupidly, weirdly graphic. After you’ve had a chance to take that in, watch it in chronological order. It only makes slightly more sense that way, but what’s truly incredible is that the music still syncs perfectly to the editing. No wonder it's already been viewed more than 4 million times.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T03:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T00:08:12.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
