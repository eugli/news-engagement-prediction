His house and land were acquired by the government for the project in the late 1970s.\nWhen the judges, in their order, directed that the \"resettlement officer open his eyes\", the government's advocate urged the court not to use \"such harsh words\" against him. This led the judges to question what was harsher â€” their words or what was done to the farmers by the district resettlement officer. \"You feel we are so harsh to the officer. He must be thrown into the dam. Along with him, his sins will also be washed,'' said Justice Chellur. \"They have no house... no land for their livelihood. Nobody bothers,\" she added. The bench also remarked on the conduct of the resettlement officer. \"He has a seat to sit. He gets a monthly salary. He doesn't feel the pinch,\" said Justice Chellur.\nThe officers \"should be ashamed of what they are doing,\" the chief justice added.\nBombale's advocate Shakuntala Wadekar argued that despite the court issuing an order in 2013, the claims of farmers have not been settled. The court was told 396 applications for resettlement were pending. Wadekar said several families had been completely uprooted and are forced to live on the road. \"Some women are roaming on the streets with their grandchildren,'' she said, adding that the farmers are illiterate and, even after documents were submitted, their claims were rejected saying insufficient documents had been provided.\nSetting March 6 as the date for the next hearing, the court directed the Pune collector to be present \"to understand what steps are to be taken so far as Chaskaman dam is concerned\". The judges also said they will arrange a Lok Adalat for the Chaskaman affected.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T16:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:01:28.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
