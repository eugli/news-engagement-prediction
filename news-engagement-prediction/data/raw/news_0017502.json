Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA mum whose daughter suffocated in the womb has hit out at health bosses claiming it was their failures that led to her baby’s death. \nSamantha Millers, from Stretford, suffered a catalogue of problems during the later stage of her pregnancy and tragically gave birth to tiny Tamara stillborn. \nThe 34-year-old, who has been fighting for answers since 2009, launched legal action against Trafford General Hospital, during which an independent doctor said in a report that had she been treated differently, it’s likely her baby would have survived. \nSamantha, who has three older children aged nine, 11, and 13, first started having problems when she suffered a bleed at 24 weeks, spending two days in hospital. Read More Mum's life is ruined by mystery illness which means she can no longer control her body \nLess than a month later, she had a bigger bleed, and was given steroids and kept in for three weeks. \nShe was finally allowed home two days before Christmas and was told to take it easy and go in for regular scans. Samantha Millers pictured with Courtney 13, Morgan, 12 and Ike, nine \nAt 34 weeks, doctors discovered an abnormal lack of oxygen through the umbilical cord. \nSamantha, who works as a carer, said: “I was having weekly scans but getting sent home each time. \n“They said they were going to induce me at 37 weeks but that came and went.

I told them I was worried because I’d had low movement. Even the midwife was concerned, but the doctor came down and said everything was fine and sent me home again. The conclusion of a doctor's report into what happened to Samantha's baby Tamara \n“Two days later I realised I hadn’t felt Tamara move – I tried everything and started to panic and my then husband Dale took me to hospital again.” \nIt was there that the couple were dealt the heartbreaking news that their baby had no heartbeat and had passed away. \n“They told me again to go home and come back the next day because they were too full to induce me. Trafford General Hospital \n“I wouldn’t have coped, I wouldn’t have slept, I was devastated and I couldn’t have gone back the next day. I just wanted it over with.” \nA post mortem was carried out on Tamara which revealed that she died from suffocation, but Samantha claims she was never told this by doctors, and only discovered her daughter’s cause of death after requesting a copy of the report herself. \nShe added: “I had to do everything myself. I think they knew what they’d done and were trying to fob me off but it didn’t work.” Read More Family of 5-year-old who died after being crippled by arthritis say it took 20 hospital visits to diagnose him \nThe last baby was delivered at Trafford General in 2010 after its maternity unit was scrapped as part of changes to maternity and children’s services. \nSamantha has since been told that no more action can be taken over her case, because the time frame for dealing with it has expired, but she has vowed to keep fighting. \nCentral Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which has since taken over the running of Trafford General Hospital, declined to comment as they did not run the hospital at the time.
