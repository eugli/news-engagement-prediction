Read More How to follow West Ham vs City tonight \n\"I think we learned and improved a lot in the beginning and then we stopped,\" he said. \"I don't want to be humble or shy or something but it was maybe my mistake. \n\"I believed we had it and they (the players) did not believe we had it. I'm pretty sure we started really good in many things and now we stopped. \n\"You have to restart that. Our build-up is so fundamental in my vision of football. \n\"When they attack the space, or when we attack in the counter-attacks, we create a lot of chances. We miss, after that, the last pass. It started in the Swansea game in the league when we won 3-1. We arrived 10 or 12 times for the last pass and we missed it. Raheem Sterling finally finished Swansea off in that game \n\"The way we play, to build up from behind, we have a lot to improve. A lot. That's why it's nice. I still have the ambition, unfinished business.\" \nCity have struggled with converting their chances and possession into goals, and have also struggled at the other end with Claudio Bravo seeing the last six shots on target fly straight into the net. \nMuch was made of the decision to replace Joe Hart with the Barcelona goalkeeper and Bravo and Guardiola have been criticised with City's defence looking slacker than it was last season. Read More Man City forward Gabriel Jesus 'not a typical No.9', warns Man City star Pablo Zabaleta \nComing to the goalkeeper's defence once more, the coach believes the Chilean will look better when his team-mates are more up to speed with the new style of playing. \n\"Claudio has to pass good to his teammates and when they are not in their right position he does not pass good so it doesn't depend on Claudio,\" he added. \n\"Claudio has the quality to do that, Willy as well, but it depends on the other one. If I want to pass the ball there but there is no player - I cannot pass the ball there.\" Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T16:49:15.683+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
