Executive Director of Public Safety Kenneth Cop told USA TODAY College in a email, “The flyer was removed and information was forwarded to the Middlesex County Prosecutors Office for review.” \nSecurity will be added to the cultural center on campus, Rutgers says . \nEarlier this week, more signs of the same design were found on the campus of University of Texas in Austin. They were plastered on utility poles and some school buildings, including the student campus center and the College of Liberal Arts, according to the the Austin American-Statesman .

Bird , the university said it supports free speech, but that posting signs on the outside of university buildings is not allowed under campus rules. Bird said only students and student organizations are allowed to post signage in approved spaces on campus. The statement did not condemn the content of the signs, only the fact that the had been posted in violation of campus rules. Related: Racially charged fliers and chalkings appear at Univ. of Michigan \n“Any person coming onto campus damaging or defacing university property is subject to criminal prosecution,” Bird said in the statement. When some try to divide us, Longhorns stand together.

Their Twitter account has been suspended , but state chapters have their own accounts. There’s also a new account called @TrueAmVanguard that posted its first tweet Monday. Everyone go follow @TrueAmVanguard \n— Vanguard Texas (@vanguard_texas) February 15, 2017 The new American Vanguard main account is now online. \n— American Vanguard (@TrueAmVanguard) February 13, 2017 \nFlyers with the American Vanguard logo have been seen on other campuses earlier this year and last year. @annaleemurphy did you see this? a professor i'm fb friends with posted this saying it was posted on campus pic.twitter.com/JcyCc96rM2 \n— Karen Muñoz (@karennashleyy) January 30, 2017 I reckon The University of Texas at Dallas needs to police their campus a little better! @UTDallasNews @UTDallasMC #Fascism #MuslimBan pic.twitter.com/xnyjtgVg21", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T05:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:17:09.103+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
