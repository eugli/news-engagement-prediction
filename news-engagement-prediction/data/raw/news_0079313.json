(brytta/Getty Images) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Tuesday, February 28, 2017, 12:01 AM \nThe state's motto may be “Excelsior” — but New York is definitely not living up to being “ever upward.” \nIn fact, a new in-depth analysis of the nation’s 50 states ranks New York going downward and just 17th overall — behind the likes of Massachusetts (the best of all), North Dakota (fourth best) and even Iowa (sixth). \nThe inaugural Best States rankings by U.S. News & World Report crunches an unprecedented amount of data in seven categories: health care, education, infrastructure, crime and correction, opportunity, economy and government. \nThe analysis used more than 10,000 data points and relied on a combination of measurable outcomes, citizen perception and data analysis to provide the most definitive ranking yet of how well people live in each state. \nMass. ranked top state, but New Yorkers not impressed \nNew York is not among the best in nearly all the categories the experts looked at. \nThe state was near rock-bottom in terms of opportunity, coming in 44th place. The state’s economy, meanwhile, came in a lowly 29th place. \nNew York was only a standout in the category of crime and correction, where it was ranked fifth best in the nation. The report said the state’s prison system was “one of the best.” \nThe seven categories are composed of a total 20 subcategories — which also paint a grim picture of New York: \n- New York’s health care quality ranked 40th. \n- The state’s transportation ranked 30th. \n- The state came in 35th in economic opportunity. In response to New York's poor ranking, Gov. Cuomo's office pointed to a recent poll showing that the majority of New Yorkers believe the state is improving. \nSenate boss says Cuomo's budget insults role of the Legislature \n- New York ranked 30th in state integrity — a showing that reflects the ongoing parade of crooked Albany politicians such as former Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver (D-Manhattan). \nState Sen. Phil Boyle (R-Suffolk County), chairman of the Commerce, Economic Development and Small Business Committee, said he is not surprised by New York’s sorry showing — citing the dismal numbers in the economy and opportunity categories. \n“We have inefficient programs and corruption,” Boyle added. \nThe state came in 32nd in growth and 33rd in employment. New York ranked last in commute time. (John Kirk/Getty Images) \nA Cuomo administration official directed the Daily News to a Siena College poll released Monday that showed 55% of New York voters believe the state is on the right track, up from 48% two months ago. \n“Over the last six years, Gov. Cuomo took a $10 billion deficit and turned it into a surplus, began rebuilding New York’s decrepit infrastructure, closed 13 prisons, cut taxes across the board, passed a $15 minimum wage and paid family leave program, and invested more in education and health care than anytime in New York’s history,” Cuomo’s office said in a statement. \n“New York’s arrows are headed in the right direction as a majority of New Yorkers said just today, and is undeniably No. 1 to anyone who has ever lived or visited here.” \nMike Durant, state director of the conservative-leaning National Federation of Independent Business, said New York was a very high-tax, high-cost state for doing businesses. \nBreakaway Senate Dems push student debt relief in state budget \n“Taxes are too high, health care costs are too high, and there isn’t a lot of opportunity here because we are not creating an environment for economic opportunity,” Durant said. The only bright spot for New York was the category of crime and correction, where the state ranked fifth best. (Scott Roth/Invision/AP) \nDurant and Boyle singled out Cuomo’s Start-Up NY program, which after $53 million in advertising had produced only 408 jobs after two years. In addition, they cited the recent corruption charges brought against several administration figures involved in the Buffalo Billion project. \nDurant said the Cuomo administration has simply tried to “throw money” to spur economic growth instead of tackling the dramatic tax reductions and regulatory reforms that are needed. \nThe three worst statistics for the state within the 20 subcategories are familiar to any New Yorker. \n- The state came in 50th in commute time. \n- The state was also dead-last in the Gini Index, used to measure inequality. New York ranked No. 30 in state integrity thanks to corrupt pols like former Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver. (Alec Tabak/for New York Daily News) \n- The state came in 49th when it came to cost of living. \nSabrina Beajaoui, 31, agreed that cost of living and inequality were bad in New York. \nPols push for half-priced MetroCards for poor New Yorkers \n“There’s lots of extremes in New York. Lots of wealthy, lots of poor — then there’s people in the middle like me,” she said. “New York chews you up and spits and you out, but that’s also part of its appeal.” \nAn examination of the two most important categories in the rankings — health care and education — revealed where New York falls short. \nThe state came in a laudable fourth place for public health — but its overall health care ranking was dragged down to 13th due to low marks in other areas. The rating was pushed down by a dreadful ranking of 45th related to its high number of hospital readmissions. New York also fell short on education.

Every state, whether it is No. 1 or No. 50 overall, has something to learn and something to teach other states,” she said. “Like all states, New York has some rankings where it falls at the bottom and some where it rises to the top.” Join the Conversation:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T12:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T08:11:31.578+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
