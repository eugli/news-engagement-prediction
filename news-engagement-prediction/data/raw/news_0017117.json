But after Sainsbury's launched these bear cups into stores, customers have pointed out that the 'arms' look like something much ruder. The long, thin and slightly curved jutting 'arms' protrude squarely underneath the bear's faces, prompting customer Kitty O'Rourke to point out that the animals look very excited to see one another. Her two-year-old son even noticed the phallic resemblance on the Â£10 mugs - leading to some very awkward questions for his mother. Shopper Kitty O'Rourke said she had some very awkward questions from her two-year-old son after spotting these hugging bear mugs in Sainsbury's - which have very phallic 'arms' Ms O'Rourke posted the picture on Sainsbury's Facebook page, and received 24 likes for her hilarious picture and caption of the phallic bear mugs Ms O'Rourke posted a picture of the mugs on Sainsbury's Facebook page, telling the supermarket that perhaps it wasn't the 'best design'. On the brown bear mug in particular, the 'arm' is jutting out in the centre of the bear's 'torso' which looks as if he has a rather impressive male organ. Other customers said the mugs were 'awful', while one cheekily wondered if the protruding arms were for 'hanging your Jammy Dodgers on'. The person running the Sainsbury's Facebook page managed to see the funny side - but feigned innocence as to what the 'arms' resembled.
