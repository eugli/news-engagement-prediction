According to the latest report by Kuo, the new 3D camera will sport an infrared module enabling it to sense 3D objects via the lens. The combination of this hardware will be able to merge 2D imagery with depth information, and will be used for gaming, augmented reality applications, facial recognition, and even iris scanning. The report also states the the IR transmitter and receiver will be done by Foxconn, and the front camera will be produced by Sony. \nRead:Apple buys Israeli firm RealFace, fuels rumours of iPhone 8 facial recognition \nApple has already introduded a dual-camera setup with the iPhone 7 Plus. \nFuther, as per a 9to5Mac report, “the 3D system works by sending invisible IR light signals outwards from the phone and then detecting the signals that bounce back off of objects using the 1.4 megapixel IR receiver”. Kuo also notes that Apple is years ahead of the Android platform in terms on 3D algorithms, giving it a prominent edge in the industry. \nAnother report from Trendforce also claims that the new iPhone 8 will sport a 5.8-inch bezel-less display, 3GB RAM unit -- the most ever used on an iPhone and will only come with two memory variants -- 64GB and 256GB. \nThe Trendforce report also claims that the price will be over $1,000. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T12:09:50.488+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
