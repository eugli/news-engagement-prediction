He predicted that as Trump continues to push his agenda, the media will oppose him every step of the way. \nFor much of the talk, Bannon labeled the media “the opposition party” as he has before. This view has been reflected in Trump’s own combative remarks with outlets he has branded “fake news.” \nBannon, who was in charge of conservative news site Bretbart News until he became Trump’s campaign CEO in August, promised that Trump’s agenda, which he said would focus on areas such as economic nationalism, would be pushed through. He predicted the “corporatist, globalist media” would oppose the president at every step. \n“He’s going to continue to press his agenda and as the economic conditions get better and jobs get better, they’re going to continue to fight,” Bannon said. “If you think they are going to give you your country back without a fight you are sadly mistaken, every day it is going to be a fight.” \n“President Trump is following through on what he promised the American people, and the mainstream media better understand something — all of those promises are going to be implemented,” he said to cheers from the audience. \nAmid some reports that Bannon and Priebus don’t get along, both men said they get on fine. \n“We share an office suite, we’re basically together from 6:30 in the morning to 11 at night,” Priebus said, adding that one of Trump’s big achievements has been to unite the Republican Party and the conservative movement. \n“I can run a little hot on occasions, and Reince is indefatigable, it’s low key but it’s determination,” Bannon said. “Reince is always steady.” \nAdam Shaw is a Politics Reporter and occasional Opinion writer for FoxNews.com.
