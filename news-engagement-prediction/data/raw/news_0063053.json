So we decided to use our powers to fish them out. \n“It will interest you to know that none of the camps in the state capital is free from the nefarious drug activities. Allowing these activities to go unchecked will spell doom to the society”, he said. \nThose arrested with large quantity of drugs would be prosecuted while the ones with a negligible quantity would be counselled and released, Ogilegwu added. adekunle ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T17:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T12:03:09.934+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
