Vancouver broke a 70-year-old record, while Castlegar broke an almost 100-year-old record. \nAnd while some clearly can’t even be bothered to clean off their cars… \nOthers are having lots more fun. \nIn Vancouver, resident Aaron Cambrin shared this video on Facebook of some orcas ‘beached’ in the sand and snow. \nResidents in Chilliwack have more than enough snow to play with as more than 80 cm fell there over the past weekend. \nSnowboarder Keaton Haraga hit the streets of Chilliwack to enjoy the fresh powder. \nAnd Chilliwack resident Joel Vaughan shared this video with Global BC of snow kayaking in Chilliwack on Feb. 5. \nAlso in Chilliwack, Chris Montgomery tried his hand at snow kayaking. \nCredit: Melissa Salt \nCredit: Merrill Palmer \nCredit: Amanda Nicole \nCheck out this video from Chilliwack. Resident Robin Russell posted it, humourously remarking that he had trouble “finding his car.” \nIn Cranbrook, Tod Lunan posted this video on Facebook of himself doing a swan dive into the snow. \nAnd in Surrey, Ruben Capo built this snow house in his yard. \nCredit: Dena Donald \nCredit: Chris van den Ouden \nCredit: Maggie Mac‎", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T03:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:20:01.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
