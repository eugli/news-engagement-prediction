Medina needed to go deep into the event to send the world title race with John Florence to the Billabong Pipe Masters. And after his close loss to Flores, apparently something happened between Rodrigues and WSL officials. \nRELATED: Gabriel Medina wake surfs behind large boat with soccer star Neymar \nRodrigues also offered an apology in the WSL press release, saying: \n“I regret my actions in Portugal last October. That is not the kind of person I strive to be and does not reflect the values of my family. It was an intense part of the season and I responded poorly to it. I want to apologize to the WSL, the officials and supporters of this community. This sport has given everything to my family and continues to provide a platform for the world’s best surfers. Good luck to everyone this season.” \nThe suspension affectively keeps Rodrigues from the Australian leg of the beginning of the 2017 Championship Tour season.
