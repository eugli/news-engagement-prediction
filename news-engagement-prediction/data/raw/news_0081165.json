Moyer will play Reed, an attorney and father who discovers his children have mutant powers and takes his family on the run, eventually joining up with an underground network of mutants. RELATED Pilot Season ’17: Scoop on This Fall’s (Possible) New Shows, Who’s In Them \nIf this all sounds very X-Men , that’s no mistake: X-Men director Bryan Singer will helm the pilot , and creator Matt Nix ( Burn Notice ) has already hinted that the new show “definitely exists in the same general kind of universe” as Marvel’s X-Men films. The cast includes Jamie Chung ( Once Upon a Time ) as mutant Blink and Blair Redford ( Switched at Birth ) as the Native American leader of the underground mutant network. \nMoyer spent seven seasons on HBO’s True Blood as bloodsucker Bill Compton; that show signed off in 2014. Recently, Moyer appeared in the FX medieval drama The Bastard Executioner and played Captain Von Trapp in NBC’s The Sound of Music Live! He’ll next be seen in Fox’s ripped-from-the-headlines crime drama Shots Fired , debuting March 22. If you like TVLine, you'll LOVE our weekly newsletter. Click here to subscribe.
