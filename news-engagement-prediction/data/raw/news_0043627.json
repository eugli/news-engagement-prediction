Don’t expect Lin-Manuel Miranda to lend his showmanship to the Oscars stage any time soon. The beloved creator of Hamilton and self-described Oscars obsessive wrote about his longtime love affair with the award show for The Hollywood Reporter , offering a reasonable explanation for why he never wants to host Hollywood’s biggest night. Some of the blame lies on Seth MacFarlane . \nI am a huge Seth MacFarlane fan, but you could tell how uncomfortable everyone in the room was with his “We Saw Your Boobs” number. You always have to do this dance as a host: You’re playing to a billion people at home, and you’re playing to anxious contestants in a room, and that’s an insanely hard thing to divide. It’s the most thankless task in the world. I have a pretty healthy ego, but it does not extend in that direction. I’d much rather be the guy writing the opening tune than having to deliver it. He’s not alone in his sentiments about hosting. Neil Patrick Harris , who hosted the Oscars in 2015, said that he probably wouldn’t take the job again, telling The Huffington Post at the time, “I don’t know that my family nor my soul could take it. It’s a beast. It was fun to check off the list, but for the amount of time spent and the understandable opinionated response, I don’t know that it’s a delightful balance to do every year or even again.” Miranda is looking forward to watching Jimmy Kimmel take on the challenge at this year’s ceremony on February 26. It will be Miranda’s first time watching the show in the room where it happens. And though he may be throwing away his shot at hosting, he’s adamant about the Oscars symbolizing something more than just famous people getting trophies. “It’s a night when the arts and artists are formally honored, and this recognition is seen by millions of people across the country and around the world,” he wrote. “The show inspires people to keep pursuing their craft, or to seek out the nominated films or the overall body of work of the nominees, and through that exposure, people gain a greater appreciation of what the art of filmmaking brings to our culture.” Share ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T04:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:54:53.635+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
