The businessman hadn't realised his location was being sent to his wife (Photo: Getty) \nAccording to Le Figaro , the flaw does not affect Android phones but was witnessed on iPhones used prior to a December iOS update. \nWhen Le Figaro contacted the company for comment, a spokesperson said: \"Uber does not publicly comment on individual cases, including the case of divorce proceedings between spouses.\" \nMirror Online has also contacted Uber for comment.
