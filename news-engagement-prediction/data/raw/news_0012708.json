It will be the first visit of a Super Bowl champion to Washington since President Donald Trump was sworn into office. \nMr. Trump’s positions have alienated some athletes, which has raised questions about whether some might choose to skip the trip while the new president is in office. \nBut Bennett said he isn’t concerned about it and thinks the team believes “in whatever I want to do.” Kraft is a supporter of Trump and attended a celebration dinner in Washington for him the night before his inauguration. \n(© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.
