Article continues below \nNevertheless, Mourinho already has plenty of defensive options to choose from so it could well be a case of one in and at least one out at Old Trafford in the summer. \nAnd before you jump to conclusions and assume the currently out of favour Luke Shaw will be among the first to be shown the exit, that might not necessarily be the case. Article continues below What caused an angry reaction from Antoine Greizmann's vs Bayer Leverkusen \nAccording to The Sun , Daley Blind could actually be the one to make way for Lindelof's arrival. \nThe Dutchman's contract at United expires at the end of next season and he has been unable to do enough to convince Mourinho he deserves an extended deal. \nThat means the Red Devils' Portuguese boss may well opt to cash in on Blind this summer after deciding he has better options than the versatile defender. \nAn unnamed source at the club reportedly told The Sun: \"Blind is one of the men set to go early this summer. He has a while left on his deal. \n“There are no plans to give him a new contract though. He’s running out of time to impress the boss. \n“He has been very versatile for the club and a good servant, but Jose thinks he has better options now.” \nBlind has largely been deployed at left-back this season - not Lindelof's natural position - so it could provide a glimmer of hope for Shaw. \nThe English full-back has hardly featured in Man United's recent good run of form and his last appearance in the Premier League actually came all the way back in October. \nBut if Blind does leave, Shaw could well be thrusted back into contention, with Matteo Darmian and Marcos Rojo also capable of playing left-back. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
