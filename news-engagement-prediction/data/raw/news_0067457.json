Her grandfather started racing when the sport first started to roar to life at tracks around Edmonton, and it's been a family affair ever since.\n'It's almost a surreal experience'\nHer father, Jay Mageau, is a local drag-racing legend. Her sisters all learned to race at a young age, but Mageau is the only one of the four who stuck with it.\n\"I've been involved with drag racing since I was 13. My grandpa drag raced starting in 1965 and he definitely got my dad involved as well,\" Mageau said.\n\"So I got my hands behind the wheel was I was in junior high school … and I've been involved with it ever since.\"\nHer parents surprised Mageau with her first race car, complete with custom paint job, long before she reached high school. The first time she hit the accelerator, she was hooked.\n\"When you're behind the wheel, times moves differently. It's amazing,\" Mageau said. \"Time slows down. It's almost a surreal experience.\"\n'This is definitely a precision sport'\nNow 26, Mageau is building on her family legacy, racing as the only licensed female in her class.\nAnd don't let her petite frame fool you.\nMageau's a master behind the wheel of her newly rebuilt race car, shaped to look like a 1955 Thunderbird.\nNow entering her 12th racing season as a rookie in the alcohol funny car class, she has been powering ahead of the local, national and North American competition.\nMageau says feeding her drive to succeed requires a lot of grunt work for her and her volunteer crew of mechanics.\nMageau's custom-built funny car can reach speeds of more than 300 kilometres per hour in less than seven seconds. (Girl Trouble)\nFunny cars can burn through up to can burn as much as 15 US gallons in fuel during a single run down the strip.\n\"This is definitely a precision sport,\" Mageau said.\n\"I'm not going out there and competing in a weekend sportsman level. The amount of work that goes into these cars, you can't just drive your old Chevy Impala out to the track and expect it to work.\"\n'Times are changing'\nDespite the challenges, Mageau won't be putting the brakes on her racing career anytime soon. In an attempt to grow her small family team, she and her father have entered a competition for a $50,000 sponsorship.\nThe Search for a Champion contest put on by Champion Auto Parts allows grassroots racers to compete for a total of $125,000 in financial backing through an online voting process.\nMageau and her volunteer team Girl Trouble Racing have made the finals for the competition which runs from Feb. 23 to March 23 online .\nMageau is among only three female funny car drivers across Canada still in the running. Being part of the minority is something she's grown accustomed to in the male-dominated sport.\nShe would like to see more women succeed in racing — a sport that has given her a drive to succeed, and allowed her to keep the family racing legacy alive.\n\"Times are changing, and it's absolutely something where men and women can and should compete in at an equal level,\" she said.\n\"And now for my father see his daughter not only competing, but excelling, I think it brings him a lot of pride but also terrifies him a little bit.\n\"There's always that gut-wrenching moment when you see someone you love take off from the starting line.\"\nWith files from Elizabeth Hames", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/girltrouble/", "http://www.sfac.championautoparts.com/"], "published": "2017-02-25T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T05:51:24.338+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
