Get what you need today in this early-morning email. Sign She also strung little, glittery hearts in the snow, and placed a bag with a heart on it in the spot.\n“I’m a teacher, so I tend to get a little festive,” Kelly said, adding that she made a similar sign after Christmas two years ago, when the city was walloped by consecutive storms.\n“Basically, I thought it would be a fun spin to a Southie tradition,” she said. “I was hoping it would make people laugh as they drove by.”\nAdvertisement\nKelly’s approach is a far cry from the truculent notes that are sometimes left on top of space savers, warning people to steer clear or risk having their tires slashed or their car keyed.\nVandalism has been a problem in the past in some Boston neighborhoods as motorists scramble to find a place to put their vehicle following particularly heavy winter storms.\nMayor Martin J. Walsh last week announced that space savers could be used 48 hours following a snow emergency, but he said any resident who resorted to writing a nasty note would face consequences — and lose their space-saving privileges.\n“If we see these signs up there, I will instruct public works to pick up the space saver and throw them in the truck. We are not going to be threatening people,’’ Walsh said during a press conference after last week’s storm. “Respect each other.’’\nKelly said her friendly space-saving notes were a mere coincidence, and she was unaware of Walsh’s edict.\nA picture of Kelly’s set up, which is on F Street, was shared to a Facebook page for South Boston residents, and it received a lot of positive attention.\n“Love it,” one person wrote.\n“How sweet is that!” another said.\nA snow emergency is no longer in effect, and Kelly doesn’t expect people to leave her spot free. But she said that’s fine. All she was trying to do was bring some joy in an otherwise dreary winter season.\n“I love holidays and being festive so I just rolled that into a spot saver theme. I’m only half expecting my spot to be there when I get home but I am glad it is making people smile,” she said.\nSteve Annear can be reached at steve.annear@globe.com .
