The answer could be due, in part, to the fact that black hair is an ongoing controversial topic . In 2009, Chris Rock made a documentary called “Good Hair” that explored the relationship that black women have with their hair. “If your hair is relaxed, white people are relaxed,” the comedian Pail Mooney says in the film. “For black women, you’re damned if you do, damned if you don’t,” Ingrid Banks, an associate professor of black studies at the University of California at Santa Barbara, told The New York Times in a 2009 article. “If you’ve got straight hair, you’re pegged as selling out. If you don’t straighten your hair,” she said, “you’re seen as not practicing appropriate grooming practices.” Yahoo Beauty has repeatedly reported on instances of women of color facing opposition to their natural hair. In a recent story, a black woman applying for work at the London-based department store Harrods was told that she wouldn’t get the job unless she chemically straightened her hair to look more “professional.” Zendaya at the 87th Annual Academy Awards in 2015.

The TV host infamously joked on Fashion Police that Zendaya’s hair “must smell of patchouli oil or weed,” and the then 18-year-old actress reacted with an insightful Instagram post: But over the past three years or so, prominent women of color — such as Solange Knowles, Kerry Washington, Issa Rae, Lupita N’yongo and Tracee Ellis Ross, and, on Sunday night, Halle Berry — have been rocking natural hair at public events. At New York Fashion Week, natural hairstyles were spotted at several runway shows, including Calvin Klein Collection, Alice & Olivia, and Gypsy Sport, suggesting that insiders are acknowledging that you can and should wear your kinky, curly, wavy, coily, and dreadlocked hair with pride. In early February, The Perception Institute conducted “ The ‘Good Hair’ Study: Explicit and Implicit Attitudes Toward Black Women’s Hair “. The study found that black women are twice as likely to report social pressure to straighten their hair at work compared to white women, and that white women demonstrate the strongest bias — both explicit and implicit — against textured hair, rating it as less beautiful, less sexy or attractive, and less professional than smooth hair. The good news: Millennial women who wear natural hair have more positive attitudes toward textured hair than all other women. This is consistent with past studies showing that millennials identify as progressive, confident, self-expressive, and open to change. How do you rate? Take the quiz and find out. And what are your thoughts? Was Halle’s hair a hit or miss? Comment below!
