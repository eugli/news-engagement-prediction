He positioned the liberal media and the judiciary purportedly allied with the previous administration as adversaries who were compromising American security with their support for more open border immigration.\nSeeking to speak to his supporters, who crowded into an airport hangar near Orlando, \"without the filter of the fake news,\" Trump carried on his tirade against the press from where he left off at the White House press conference. He accused the \"dishonest media\" of publishing \"one false story after another with no sources,\" and charged \"They've become a big part of the problem. They are part of the corrupt system.\"\n\"They have their own agenda and their agenda is not your agenda... We are not going to let the fake news tell us what to do, how to live, or what to believe. We are free and independent people and we will make our own choices,\" Trump told his worshipful flock, while insisting that reports about White House dysfunction were false and things were \"running smoothly\" despite his having inherited \"one big mess.\"\nThe claim came amid accounts of multiple vacancies, unfilled positions, resignations, and firings in the White House and the State Department , as traditionalists bolted from serving in the Trump administration because of its unorthodox functioning.\nThe US President also expanded his protectionist vision beyond American shores, pointing out to problems in Germany, France, Belgium and other European countries, and saying it was all because they took in large numbers of people without vetting them.\nAmid reports that his administration is revoking the global entry permit of many Muslims, including US citizens and green card holders, and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly is expanding and empowering the mandate of immigration officials to corral illegal immigrants, Trump warned: \"We've allowed thousands and thousands of people into our country and there was no way to vet those people. There was no documentation. So we're going to keep our country safe.\"\nIn virtually announcing the tightening of America's long-cherished immigration principles, the US President also opened himself to ridicule by loosely inventing fake terrorist attacks to justify his stand, as he referred to some unreported incident in Sweden. \"You look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this. Sweden. They took in large numbers,\" he said.\nAs the world media riffled through stories to see what happened in Sweden last night, the Swedish press cheekily reproduced a list of minor mishaps and accidents that occurred in the country, and its former Prime Minister Carl Bildt tweeted, \"Sweden? Terror attack? What has he been smoking?\" Chelsea Clinton joined in the mockery, asking, \"What happened in Sweden Friday night? Did they catch the Bowling Green Massacre perpetrators?\" referring to a similar fictitious terror attack in Bowling Green drummed up by Trump's aide Kellyanne Conway .\nBetween the ridicule in liberal-globalist circles and the adulation among his nativist-isolationist constituency, Trump is still interviewing candidates to be his National Security Advisor , even as reports emerged -- on the basis of leaked tapes -- of his unorthodox approach to filling administration jobs. In one instance, he is heard inviting - perhaps jokingly -- members of his club to see him interviewing his cabinet principals.\nSuch a seemingly flippant approach to governance has worried Republican stalwarts such as John McCain , a sometime Trump critic. \"I worry about the President's understanding of some of these issues and his contradictory articulations,\" McCain said in one interview, while warning that suppressing a free press, which critics are accusing Trump of doing, is \"how dictators get started.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T20:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:19:46.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
