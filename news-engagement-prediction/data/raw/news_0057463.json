Speaking To Strangers \nSoutherners (whether it’s a fair assumption or not) have the reputation of not being the friendliest bunch especially when it comes to acknowledging strangers. \nWhether it’s simply smiling at someone in the street or speaking to your fellow commuters on public transport – it’s just not something that is regularly seen. \nIt’s a stark contrast up in the north. \nYou don’t have to worry about making awkward eye contact and digging your head into your mobile phones because most northerners will actually – deep breath – be willing to talk to you. \nIt isn’t always the most stimulating conversation, but sometimes it’s nice to have a friendly chat about the weather on your morning commute – this is a concept which may seem quite alien to a born and bred southerner. 2. The weather Classic Scotland (Picture: Getty) \nTo be fair the UK as a whole isn’t exactly known for it’s glorious weather, but up in the north the weather can actually be much harsher. \nThe phrase ‘it’s grim up north’ wasn’t coined for no reason. \nThe weather, however, is something northerners are completely unfazed by. \nIt’s going to take more than a splash of rain to ruin a northerner’s night out. 3. Calling lunch ‘dinner’ \nYes, this might be hard for southerners to swallow, but many in the north actually refer to lunchtime as ‘dinner’. \nIf you hail from the south it’s probably best to be aware of this before heading up north as it could lead to a lot of confusion. \nOh and to add insult to injury dinner is often referred to as ‘tea’ as well. 4. Greggs obsession Greggs, everywhere you look! (Picture: Greggs/Metro) \nWhile you might stumble across the odd Greggs down south, in the north there is almost no escape. \nWalk down any high street in the north and it won’t be one minute before you pass one of these delicious paradises. \nA lot of southerners may not understand the north’s affinity with Greggs, but after trying one of their pasties you might start to. 5. Gravy goes with everything \nTo most southerners gravy is taken for granted. \nIt’s simply something to complement a meal – whereas in the north it quite often IS the meal. \nNortherners understand that sometimes there’s nothing better than a roast dinner drowning in gravy and the classic ‘chips and gravy’ combination is basically considered a delicacy. 6. Southerners are all ‘soft’ \nIf you’re a southerner in the north, it doesn’t matter how tough or intimidating you think you are – to northerners you are and always will be ‘soft’. \nIt’s worth noting that northerners just love to tease you and this is another satisfying way of doing so, but many consider southerners being soft as a scientific fact. 7. Northern slang Brush up on your northern slang with a bit of Wallace and Gromit, chuck (Picture: BBC) \nNot only do northerners have a wide range of (sometimes hard to understand) accents, they also have some of the best slang. \nThis slang makes perfect sense to other northerners – however to a southerner things can get very confusing, very quickly when exposed to these words. \nIf you’re from the south and plan on visiting, perhaps read through the urban dictionary first.
