Life thrives on Gloria Knolls \nDespite the harsh, deep conditions on the Gloria Knolls, life continued to flourish there. (Supplied: CSIRO) \n\"The tops of the underwater debris blocks extend about 30 kilometres outward from the edge of the Great Barrier Reef and are sitting in about 1,200 metres of water,\" he said. \n\"It's completely dark, it's quite cold, about 4 degrees Celsius, and yet we have a habitat for cold water corals that are attached to rocks buried in the mud. \n\"When we brought a sample up there was a lot more marine life there than we ever anticipated, so that was a real surprise.\" \nDr Beaman was hopeful further research would uncover more of the reef's mysteries. \n\"There's still a lot of the deep Great Barrier Reef yet to be mapped with modern tools, so I think there's lots of scope for further discovery,\" he said. \n\"We'd like to know more about the deep animals of the Great Barrier Reef because, yes, the shallow water corals are all very important, but we want to understand about the deep marine life too. \n\"This is an area that's really emerging.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T04:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:47:35.679+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
