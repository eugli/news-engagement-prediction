Unfortunately, that’s not our reality.\nWhen the “Day Without Immigrants” protests transpired last week, over one hundred employees were fired for participating in their “right to peaceably assemble” per the Constitution. The national movement was ignited by Donald Trump’s executive order regarding the immigrant ban.\nBradley Coatings, Inc. of Nolensville, TN is standing by their decision to terminate the employees who didn’t show up to work claiming that they had other reason to dismiss the designated twenty staff members.\nTheir attorney, Robert Peal, states : “Regretfully, and consistent with its prior communication to all its employees, BCI had no choice but to terminate these individuals. The reason these employees missed work — to engage in peaceful demonstrations — had nothing to do with BCI’s decision to terminate them.”\nWhile Long Island’s Ben’s Kosher Delicatessen Restaurant & Caterers bore no shame in having the police escort out employees returning to work from the protests.\nTrump has said that he will be issuing a revised executive order regarding the ban some time this week. Considering the current order temporarily bars visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries and places an indefinite halt on refugees from war-torn Syria, we don’t quite know what to expect with the revisions. One could only hope that these protests have given the president a new perspective.\nRelated:\nWatch TV shows , movies and more on Yahoo View , available now on iOS and Android .\nThis post ‘Day Without Immigrants’ Protests Result In Over 100 Terminations first appeared on Vibe .", "external_links": ["http://www.vibe.com/2017/02/day-without-immigrants-result-terminations/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=syndication&quot;", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yahoo.view&quot;", "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/320328-more-than-100-employees-fired-for-participating-in-day-without&quot;", "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/320328-more-than-100-employees-fired-for-participating-in-day-without", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yahoo.view", "https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1149490943?pt=9029&ct=tout&mt=8", "http://www.vibe.com/2017/02/day-without-immigrants-result-terminations/?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=syndication", "https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1149490943?pt=9029&amp;ct=tout&amp;mt=8&quot;", "http://www.vibe.com/author/ashleyp/"], "published": "2017-02-20T20:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:16:06.830+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
