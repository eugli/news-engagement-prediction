'Pit of skulls' \nIn total, two dogs, a calf, some birds and a pig were found on the site at the Greek Orthodox Church, on Oteley Road, along with the remains of an early medieval woman and a pit full of human skulls. \nThe pig was found with a leathered coffin, although Miss Green said further testing was needed to see if the animal was buried in the container. \nThe animals were found alongside medieval human remains. All of the finds will be reinterred by the church.

Image caption The Greek Orthodox Church has foundations that go back possibly to Saxon times \n\"We have excavated foundations for the church that are very early medieval - and possibly Saxon,\" Miss Green said. \n\"But it is unprecedented to find such an array of different animals on consecrated ground.\" \nShe said she did not know why the animals were buried together and was working on a number of theories, including a possible link to a nearby Bronze Age site. \nThe remains will now be tested to determine their age before being re-buried on the site.
