However, Malaysian police rejected this request, saying the death was sudden and occurred under mysterious circumstances. \nMalaysian armed guards stood watch at the hospital holding the body of Kim Jong Nam, the assassinated half-brother of North Korea's leader , amid reports his son had come to Kuala Lumpur to claim the remains. \nA convoy of four unmarked vehicles entered the hospital compound in the early hours of the morning, with around 30 Malaysian special forces securing the area before all of them left by mid-morning. - CNA/AFP/mn", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T10:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T05:41:44.182+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
