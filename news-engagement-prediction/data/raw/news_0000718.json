Photo by Christian Gooden, cgooden@post-dispatch.com \nRailway Exchange Building \nA Florida-based developer completed on Tuesday its purchase of the century-old Railway Exchange Building in downtown St. Louis. \nThe new owner is Hudson Holdings of Delray Beach, Fla. A real estate source said the company paid just above $20 million for the building that occupies an entire block in the middle of downtown. \nHudson Holdings did not respond to requests for comments about its plans. The company put the building under contract last spring. \nReal estate sources in St. Louis have said the most likely redevelopment would include a mixture of residences, stores and, perhaps, a hotel. \nThe Railway Exchange Building, built in 1914, has 21 floors and 1.2 million square feet of space. It was formerly the headquarters of the May Department Stores Co. and site of downtown’s Macy’s department store. \nMacy’s, which previously was Famous-Barr’s flagship store, closed in 2013 and the building, at 601 Olive Street, has been vacant since Macy’s closed its offices there. The property includes the parking garage connected to the Railway Exchange by a fourth-floor skywalk over Olive. \nAccording to its website, Hudson Holdings says it emphasizes “downtown historic adaptive re-use” and tries to “energize older, transformational assets.” Its projects include the nearly century-old Huntington Building in downtown Cleveland, the Textile Building in Cincinnati, and the Mark Twain Building in downtown Kansas City. \nWhen it closed, Macy’s downtown St. Louis store occupied the Railway Exchange’s three lower floors, less than a third of the space the Famous-Barr store once filled.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T05:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:17:34.580+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
