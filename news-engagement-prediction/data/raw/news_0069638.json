(AP)  21 PM \nAuthorities have a DNA profile and are closing in on a person of interest in the Massachusetts killing of Google executive Vanessa Marcotte, a New York City resident. \nThe suspect is a Hispanic or Latino man with light to medium-toned skin and an athletic build, Worcester District Attorney Joseph Early Jr. said Thursday. The suspect, believed to be around 30 years old, would have had scratches on his face, neck, hands and arms following the fatal Aug. 7 attack in Princeton, according to Early. \nThe person of interest has not been identified because the DNA has been passed through national criminal databases without a hit. \nMarcotte grew up in nearby Leominster and worked as an account manager for Google in New York.

She was raped and strangled after she attempted to fight her attacker. \nWith News Wire Services", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:48:24.446+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
