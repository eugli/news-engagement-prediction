All correspondence should contain your physical mailing address. Begin your letters with Dear Representative -LastName- or Dear Senator -LastName-.Avoid boilerplate text. Communication has more impact if the words are yours, not those of some public affairs person assigned to generate a grassroots campaign. Use the prepared text as a guide only.Be courteous, be brief (get to the point!), be specific. House of Representatives For details about your Representative -- including mailing address for the district and capitol offices -- use CongressMerge.com or Congress.org website services. You can find the phone and office number of your US Representative on the House website: list by state ; alphabetical list . The House of Representatives also provides web-based \"form mail\" for all US Representatives. Senate The Senate website contains an alphabetical list of all Senators, with their capitol addresses and a link to their Senate website, which will have information about state offices and telephone numbers. It also has a link to the Senate's web/form mail for each Senator.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:06:17.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
