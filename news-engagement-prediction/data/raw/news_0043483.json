How Brexit gamble could bring down the City \nEU membership helped London become Europe’s biggest financial centre; a hard Brexit could spell the end of its dominance The Bank of England is at the heart of London’s world of finance.

When Theresa May triggers article 50 – likely to happen within days of the event – she starts the two-year Brexit process that will help determine how banks shape their operations in the UK over the next 40 years, and whether the City can retain its dominance as Europe’s biggest financial centre and a go-to location for major international banks. \nThe City of London – which has faced heavy criticism for financial risk-taking – now finds itself dealing with the consequences of someone else’s gamble. The crown jewel of Britain’s economy is poised to become a key test of the prime minister’s Brexit strategy, and when the UK triggers article 50, major City employers are expected to roll out contingency plans that could lead to them moving parts of their operations outside the UK. \nBanks, insurance companies and fund managers will be seeking assurances about the type of deal May’s government can secure. \nBankers argue much is at stake. The lobby group TheCityUK calculates that financial and related professional services employ more than 7% of the UK workforce, not just in London, and produce nearly 12% of the UK’s total economic output. The City generates a trade surplus of £72bn, which means it sells more services abroad than in the UK. \nEvery day rumours swirl about which bank – usually an American one – intends to shift hundreds, or thousands, of staff abroad in preparation for Brexit. Forecasts for jobs at risk range from about 30,000, by the Brussels-based Bruegel thinktank, and 232,000, by the London Stock Exchange chief, Xavier Rolet . The City could become a tumbling Jenga tower if too many building blocks are removed, says one expert.

International banks, fund managers and big brokerage firms based themselves in London and conducted business across the EU by using “passporting” rights attached to membership of the single market. Passporting allows a banker employed by a UK-based operation of a US, Asian or other non-EU bank to tout for business from companies and individuals inside the single market. More than 8,000 EU firms hold a passport that allows them to operate in the UK and 5,500 have been issued with passports by UK regulators to operate in the EU. \nLeaving the EU means this passport expires – raising questions about what future laws will be used on contracts for major transactions such as complex derivatives. \nSir Howard Davies, the chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, said the amalgamation of people and activities in London by international banks is impressive when compared with their other foreign outposts. “It’s remarkable if you look at the big investment banks – it’s thousands and thousands [of jobs] here and tens in other places,” he said. \nIt means that London conducts three-quarters of all European trading in foreign exchange and interest rates and half of all fund management activities. Major European companies ask investors in London to buy their debt, so they can use that money to finance their activities. \nThe debate about how those European companies will be affected if the City loses its dominance is the “current battleground”, according to Davies. And the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) is trying to quantify it, measuring how Brexit will affect the ability of companies in the EU27 countries to raise financing.

But even before May made clear this was not going to be possible, the mood had changed. The industry is starting to coalesce around ideas known as “mutual recognition” and “expanded equivalence”, which largely achieve the same goal – the ability to operate seamlessly in the UK and EU – but give May the control over UK borders that she seeks. \n“The extent to which we get equivalence will depend on the extent to which we can bring home the argument that not agreeing a reasonable degree of equivalence between London and the rest of the EU is actually going to be disruptive to Europe’s capital markets and damage the ability of European companies to raise funds,” said Davies. \nIn practice, major City firms do not have the time to wait for the outcome of the negotiations. The Bank of England has made it clear it is asking banks to prepare for hard Brexit. A report for AFME by accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers said banks were having to plan for a hard Brexit but also said the banks it had interviewed had committed to a plan of action. \nThe two years to negotiate Britain’s EU exit are not enough, major banks argue, to make the changes they need to set up new operations, apply for regulatory licences and hire new staff. \n“As our latest report from PwC shows, we’re going to get into a situation where for some organisations there is not a lot of time to get the answers [they] need,” an AFME official said. \nFew City firms want to go public with their plans – but financial centres inside the remaining EU countries, notably Dublin, Paris, Frankfurt and Madrid – are all vying for a slice of the Brexit pie.

Swiss Bank UBS has talked about potential centres in Frankfurt and Madrid. Big US banks JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Citi are all working on plans. \nSome bankers fear staff numbers in the UK could be cut in half. Davies is convinced no one really wants to move but concedes that jobs will go – though not on a scale that will “leave empty caverns … [or] rubbish blowing through empty windows” in the heart of the City. \nHowever, even a trickle could become a flood if the benefits of banks clustering together in London start to erode. Industry leaders such as Lloyd Blankfein, of Goldman Sachs, have said new hiring could be on hold while foreign investors work out what Brexit means. \nIf May cannot pull a rabbit from the hat in her EU talks, it may be the likes of Goldman that deliver the most visible verdict. \nGoldman is building a new London HQ near St Paul’s Cathedral – which is expected to have a doctor, dentist and dry-cleaner’s so employees never have to leave the office. But how many will set foot in the building when it is finished in 2019? It can hold 8,000 people – more than the 6,000 currently on Goldman’s London payroll. \nIf that payroll shrinks, fears will grow that the building could symbolise the first of many white elephants in a new menagerie. \nBrexit banking job losses \nHSBC 1,000 roles confirmed to Paris – half of them returning French nationals. Goldman Sachs 3,000 roles rumoured to be going, some to Frankfurt. JP Morgan 4,000 roles could go, the bank has warned.
