Until LG gets the chance to unveil everything there is to know about the G6, we can now take a look at a couple of new photos that seemingly show the handset in the wild. As you can see below, we're treated with a silver version of the LG G6 shown from the front, and back. These new photos don't contradict the previously leaked images (see here , here , or here ), and neither what LG itself shared about the device. Thus, it's almost safe to assume that this is what the G6 will look like, though we're not ruling out any surprises in this regard. With a 5.7-inch Full Vision display that occupies most of its front side, the G6 looks quite different from last year's G5. However, things aren't that different on the back, as the new phone features a dual main camera and a fingerprint scanner just below it - somewhat similar to its predecessor, though it appears that (fortunately) there are no bumps on the back of the G6 whatsoever. The G6 will run Android 7 Nougat out of the box, coming with a new interface dubbed LG UX 6.0. As you'll notice in the first photo below, the interface unsurprisingly includes an Always On display mode. The upcoming LG flagship phone is expected to be powered by a Snapdragon 821 processor, not the newer Snapdragon 835 - but this isn't such a bad idea if you think about the circumstances. Other notable features that the G6 will likely offer are: water resistance, 4 GB of RAM, USB Type-C port, and a 3200 mAh battery. The smartphone could be released in the US starting early April, most probably via all major carriers New photos seemingly show the LG G6 in the wild Popular galleries", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T07:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T02:20:16.130+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
