Unlike most kids, however, she was born with her heart outside of her chest. Virsaviya was born with Pentalogy of Cantrell , a rare disorder that makes her heart and intestines sit outside of her body. She's also missing her diaphragm, parts of her chest bones, and some abdominal muscles. \"My heart is right here . It's outside of my chest, and I really love my mom; she's always touching my heart because she likes it,\" Virsaviya told NBC Miami back in 2015.

Dari started a YouCaring fund with hopes of reaching a $200,000 goal. After NBC Miami aired that segment about Virsaviya in 2015, more and more people started to donate, and an anonymous donor reportedly reached out to NBC Miami offering to cover the remainder of the goal. As of today, however, the YouCaring page has only raised $70,000. The money, Dari says, will be used for emergency medical expenses and, eventually, for the surgery. She says doctors have recommended that Virsaviya wait a few years before getting surgery because of her high blood pressure. A post shared by ✨@fit_thick_Riri✨ (@dariborun) on Nov 28, 2016 at 10:55am PST In the meantime, however, Dari is struggling to make ends meet. She supports Virsaviya as a single mother and puts money away for medical bills and the eventual surgery. \"It's gonna be expensive for sure, and I tried to work with a social worker, and she said we don't have the opportunity to apply for insurance,\" Dari said. But the immense support the pair has already received has helped. \"I don't have a family here. It's just me and Virsaviya, but now I feel like I have a family because a lot of people just caring about us. They love us. They want to help,\" Dari said. A post shared by ✨@fit_thick_Riri✨ (@dariborun) on Dec 31, 2016 at 11:15am PST The duo is currently residing in Florida while they await Virsaviya's surgery in Boston. The warmth of the weather — and their supportive community — has truly been amazing. \"She deserves this! She is so young and at the same time so strong; she is great! I have so much respect for her,\" one woman commented on one of Borun's Instagram photos .
