During a gaffe that will go down in Academy Awards history -- on account of nothing like this has ever happened! And it was INSANE! -- the musical was named the night's big winner, adding to its six other wins. Except that in a seriously confusing turn of events that played out live on air, Moonlight actually won . Hed: EXCLUSIVE: 'La La Land' Producer Jordan Horowitz Reacts to 'Shocking' Best Picture Flub: 'I'm at a Little Bit of a Loss for Words' Viewers have gone back to zoom in on the exact moment when Emma Stone and Damien Chazelle realize, amid all the acceptance speeches onstage, what had actually happened.

Which brings us to this photo, which shows the moment the La La Land producers had to essentially hand over their Oscars. It's also what many have christened as the moment Gosling realized he was the only one from the movie going home empty-handed.

That one photo alone is a bit fake news-y, as Gosling certainly may have been disappointed, but he hugged just as many members of the Moonlight cast and we have a feeling he's going to be OK. Photo: Getty Images For her part, Stone said backstage , \"I f**king love Moonlight . God, I love Moonlight so much…Of course, it was an amazing thing to hear La La Land. I think we all would have loved to win Best Picture, but we are so excited for Moonlight . I think it is one of the best films of all time, so I was pretty beside myself.” RELATED SLIDESHOW", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T14:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T10:06:44.976+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
