Motorists can stop in at the 50,000-square-foot Caterpillar Visitor Center, which houses a company museum. The minor-league Peoria Chiefs play baseball at Dozer Park, named after Caterpillar bulldozers. \nWhat does Caterpillar mean to Peoria? \n\"There's a term for it, that if you work for Caterpillar, you bleed yellow,\" said Ryan Murphy, 46, a former Caterpillar employee who now runs a downtown bar. \"So many people's whole families work for Caterpillar.\" \nAnd though Murphy said the move would hurt downtown business, he believed the town's economy would survive the loss. \n\"It's just one of those bumps in the road where you see the pothole coming and ... and you hope you don't have a flat tire,\" Murphy said. \nWhen Paul Berres, 58, heard the news, he immediately called his father, a former Caterpillar employee now living in Florida.
