PUBLISHED: 00:10,  20, Wed, Feb 15, 2017 GETTY Catalonia's bid for independence was dealt a fresh blow after the referendum vote was blocked \nThe Madrid-based Constitutional Court claimed the independence bid was “unconstitutional”, cancelling the resolution outright. \nThe decision is likely to fuel tensions between the Spanish and Catalan governments, with relations already strained after the region’s former president, Artur Mas, stood trial last week charged with civil disobedience and misconduct after his attempts to push an independence vote through.

GETTY Former president Artur Mas (2nd L) alongside his successor Carles Puigdemont (C) in court last week \nDespite the court’s block Mr Mas went ahead with the symbolic vote anyway in November 2014, with more than 80 per cent of the 2.3 million voters opting for independence - although only a small proportion of the 6.3 million eligible voters took part. \nMr Mas’ move resulted in the charges he is now on trial for, with prosecutors pushing for the former president to be banned from public office for 10 years if he is found guilty.
