Sit back for a period of two years because seventeen is going to be a disaster, a disaster for Obamacare if we don’t do something. Let it be a disaster because we can blame that on the Dems that are in our room, and we can blame that on the Democrats and President Obama. Let it implode, and then let it implode in eighteen even worse, don’t do anything, and they will come begging for us to do something. But that’s not the fair thing to do for the people, not the fair thing. Politically, I think it would be a great solution. Because as soon as we touch it, if we do the most minute thing, just a tiny little change. What’s gonna happen? They’re going to say, ‘It’s the Republicans’ problem.’ That’s the way it is.” \nPresident Trump said that this is what Republicans can’t do, but what he described is the most likely outcome for Obamacare repeal. \nTrump was actually arguing for Republicans not to repeal Obamacare so that they don’t get the blame for killing it, but at the same time, he was also arguing that they have to get rid of Obamacare. \nThe President’s contradictory remarks made it clear that the White House still has no replacement plan for the ACA. \nRepublicans in Congres have also not agreed on a replacement plan, so the most likely outcome remains that they repeal Obamacare, and then blame Democrats and President Obama for 20 million Americans losing their health care. \nWhat Trump and the Republicans don’t realize is that the blame Obama card has expired. Obama is no longer in office. Once people lose their health care, they’re going to rightly blame the Republicans for repealing the law. \nHealth care is already Trump’s problem because the President already signed an executive order weakening the ACA, and Republicans have already put the wheels in motion to repeal the law. \nRepublicans are getting desperate because they are sinking under the weight of their own self-inflicted health care crisis. \nBlame Obama can’t save them this time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T23:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T18:53:08.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
