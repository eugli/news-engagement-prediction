To kick off the evening, host Jimmy Fallon revved up his so-called feud with actor Matt Damon--a move which foreshadowed the comedian's jokes throughout his subsequent evening broadcast. Fallon was not however the only comedian posting a likable pic. Amy Schumer toyed with the difficult question of what to wear, exemplifying her usual hilarious sense of humor. Performer Justin Timberlake shared a glimpse behind the scenes of his preparation process, while his wife Jessica Biel posted a few pics while getting ready to go. (As one image of her window view attests, the actress didn't have far to travel to get to the Dolby Theatre). Inside the theater, once the show got going, stars shared images of themselves with friends. Chrissy Teigen looked like she was having a good time at the bar, while besties Busy Philipps and Michelle Williams were photo-bombed by Salma Hayek. However, with the after-parties still to come, the fun--and the best celebrity Instagrams from the 2017 Oscars--are just getting started. #Oscars2017, partying the night away.
