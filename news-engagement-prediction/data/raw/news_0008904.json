Building settlements is a crime, building settlements is against all international laws,” the Palestinian tourism and antiquities minister, Rula Maayaa, said on Tuesday. “I think it is time now for the international community to act concretely to stop the Israelis from these crimes.” \nNabil Abu Rdeneh, a spokesman for the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, said the law was “unacceptable” and urged the international community to act immediately. “This is an escalation that would only lead to more instability and chaos,” he said. \nThe Arab League’s chief, Ahmed Aboul Gheit said the law was “a cover for stealing the land appropriating the property of Palestinians”. \nThe UK’s Middle East minister, Tobias Ellwood, said of the law, which is almost certain to be challenged in Israel’s courts: “It is of great concern that the bill paves the way for significant growth in settlements deep in the West Bank, threatening the viability of the two-state solution. As a longstanding friend of Israel, I condemn the passing of the land regularisation bill by the Knesset, which damages Israel’s standing with its international partners.” \nThe Trump administration has said it will withhold comment “until the relevant [Israeli] court ruling”. \nHuman rights groups suggested the message was that Israel had no intention of ending the occupation. \n“The bill further entrenches the current reality in the West Bank of de facto permanent occupation where Israeli settlers and Palestinians living in the same territory are subject to separate and unequal systems of laws, rules and services,” Human Rights Watch said. \nThat impression was reinforced during the Knesset debate on the bill when Israeli rightwingers pushed their claim on occupied Palestinian territories as belonging to a biblical land of Israel – and to Jews – by right. \nThe technology minister, Ofir Akunis, a member of Netanyahu’s Likud party, insisted “on the connection between the Jewish people and its land”, adding: “This whole land is ours. All of it.” \nThe international community has long regarded all Jewish settlements as illegal, a view reinforced by December’s US-enabled UN security council resolution . But experts point out that the new law goes a significant step further even than Israel’s 50-year military occupation. \nCrucially, Israeli MPs have voted for a law whose principal impact will be on Palestinian landowners who have no say in electing those MPs, and to whom the wider Israeli political system is in no way democratically accountable. \nDan Meridor, a former Likud minister, opposed the law for exactly this reason. Writing in Haaretz before the bill’s passage through parliament, Meridor warned: “The Knesset was elected by Israelis and legislates for them. The Arabs of [the occupied Palestinain territories] did not vote for the Knesset, and it has no authority to legislate for them. \n“These are basic principles of democracy and Israeli law. As a rule, elected officials legislate for their constituents and those within the area of their jurisdiction, not others.” \nNetanyahu had voiced misgivings about the law in the lead-up to the vote, reportedly expressing concern that it could trigger international censure and saying he wanted to coordinate with the Trump administration before moving ahead on a vote. \nIsrael’s far-right Jewish Home party has been pushing for the imposition of Israeli law in Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, and there have been calls for the formal annexation of the settlement block of Maale Adumim as well as other parts of the West Bank. \nUnderlining that point on Tuesday, the education minister and Jewish Home leader, Naftali Bennett, told Israel’s Army Radio that the goal of the legislation was to create the same conditions in the settlements as in Israel proper. \n“At the end of the day, behind all the talk there is a simple question: what do we want for the future of Israel?” he said.
