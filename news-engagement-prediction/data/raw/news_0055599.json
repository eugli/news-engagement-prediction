He even made 10 of 13 free throws. \nOn a night when UK couldn't get much going offensively, Adebayo either scored, got fouled or drew enough defensive attention to open up the floor for other guys. \nGet the latest UK news sent straight to your inbox with out EMAIL NEWSLETTER \nAt times this season, NBA scouts have questioned Adebayo's rebounding numbers but Tuesday night, his 15 boards were a career-best as he posted his fourth double-double of the season and second double-digit rebound performance in his last three games. \n2) Slip Slidin' Away \nThe Wildcats have now won five straight games since losing three of four, but it sure doesn't feel that way. \nDespite coming away from Columbia with the win Tuesday night, it was another monumental struggle for this Kentucky team, which just seems like, despite the fact they're winning games, have been heading in the wrong direction for the last several weeks. \nTeams have now made a concerted effort to stop UK's fastbreak and make them score in the half court and at times, the Cats look like a collection of mismatched parts. \nJohn Calipari said after the game, in which his team tied a season-high with 17 turnovers, he thinks guys are having a crisis of confidence. \n\" We've got some guys not playing well. Guys not playing with confidence. Not playing consistent,\" Calipari said. \"I don't understand how guys, especially seniors, not being excited to show what they're about.\" \n3) Beats The Alternative \nLast time I checked, an ugly win is still a win nonetheless and they all count the same. \nWith the win, Kentucky not only avoided what would have been a catastrophic loss, the Wildcats go into Saturday's revenge game against Florida with potentially an SEC regular season championship, the No. 1 seed in the SEC Tournament and perhaps the No. 3 seed in the South Region (Memphis) on the line Saturday. \nAll things considered, this team is 13-2 in the league and 23-5 overall. \nWe'll know a lot more about this team after Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T12:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:20:51.862+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
