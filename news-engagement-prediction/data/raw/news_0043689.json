Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThe father of the twin girls adopted by Madonna is reportedly shocked that the agreement is permanent. \nAdam Mwale - who was in court for the adoption hearing earlier this month - claimed he was misled about the official agreement as he thought his children would be returned to him one day. \nHe said: \"I was told from the start that Esther and Stella were going to a rich woman's home abroad, that she would give them a good education, then return them to me, to live with me and help all of my family.

That cannot be true - I don't want it to be true. I am their father and I will always be their father.\" \nMr Mwale claims he was told Madonna wanted to take the twins and educate them and when he consulted his late wife's family, they agreed it would be a fantastic opportunity for the girls and he should go ahead. \nThe 40-year-old farmer - whose wife Patricia died while giving birth to the twins - claimed a court appointed guardian told \"terrible lies\" and told the judge he had abandoned his family, including five other children aged between eight and 20, to marry another woman. \nBut he told the Mail on Sunday newspaper: \"It was me who took the girls to the orphanage after Patricia died. We had been happily married for many years. We had a good family life. But when she gave birth to the twins, she lost a lot of blood and died.\" \nMr Mwale says he wanted help from the hospital to look after his twins, but was told that the orphanage was the best place for them. He says everyone in his village understood he just wanted the best for his daughters. Madonna shared sweet pictures to celebrate the adoption (Photo: Instagram/madonna) \nMr Mwale remarried two years after Patricia's death but still visited the twins regularly at the orphanage and worked to pay for their education. \nHe said he used to cycle the four-hour round trip to the orphanage every day to see his daughters, and would take them dresses and gifts, and that they would sit on his lap and laugh and play with him. \nWhile the court procedure was taking place, Adam spent 12 days away with his daughters. \nHe added that he believed his girls would get a \"great education\", something he could never afford, but that the whole thing was just temporary. \nDr Mary Shawa, from the Malawian ministry which processed the adoption said: \"I can't say why the guardian told the court that Mr Mwale had abandoned his children. The judge said that was wrong.\" Read More Madonna's daughter Lourdes with the twins (Photo: Madonna/Instagram) Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T18:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T14:27:06.797+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
