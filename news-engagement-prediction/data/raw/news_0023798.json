I like Joe Riggs here. \n“Been a fan of his for years, not sure why the commentators thought it was close? It was an ass kicking by Riggs.” \nThe clip comes after footage emerged from Miami, Florida, lifting the lid on the murky world of unregulated bareknuckle boxing that gave rise to MMA icons like Kimbo Slice and Jorge Masvidal.
