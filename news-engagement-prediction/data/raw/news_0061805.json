A 2005 Davidson College grad, Hughes earned her law degree from the University of South Carolina School of Law in 2009. Kristen Hughes, American & Efird Melissa Key After nearly three years at American & Efird, Hughes likes that she’s the corporate counsel at a manufacturing company with an international presence. “You throw in three acquisitions in the last three years into that equation and things get even more interesting,” Hughes says. Why law? I like to think analytically but I also love learning about businesses and corporate law seemed to merge both of those interests. Why American & Efird? After spending nearly four years burning the midnight oil at a big law firm I was ready to make a change. I always knew I wanted to end up in-house but also knew I needed to learn from the best lawyers first, and big law was the place to get that experience. It was just chance and good fortune that I ended up at American & Efird. I was contacted by a recruiter about the position and the rest is history. Do you have a guiding principle that has led you in your corporate life? I don’t know if I would call it a guiding principle but the best advice I have ever received was to fall on the sword as soon as you make a mistake. If your mistake hasn’t been discovered yet, bring it to someone’s attention. If it has, immediately fess up and apologize. And then don’t make that same mistake again. I also try to treat others how I would want to be treated. Folks say you’re really enthusiastic about the company and the job. What gets you going on those two subjects? I think the combination of being an international company and a manufacturer presents incredibly interesting business and legal challenges. You throw in three acquisitions in the last three years into that equation and things get even more interesting. It’s exciting to be a part of because I get to be involved in significant business transactions and decisions. Tell me something about your community activities. I’ve been involved with the United Way since 2011. I started out on the United Way Young Leaders Council and just completed my term on the board of the United Way of Central Carolinas. I plan to stay involved with the UWCC but am also looking to become more involved in other local agencies.
