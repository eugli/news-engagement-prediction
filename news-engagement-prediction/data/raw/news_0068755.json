(Getty Images/George Gojkovich) More The Chicago Cubs’ World Series run saw a number of franchise icons return to the limelight. One name, however, remained conspicuously absent from the festivities as the team inched toward a championship. Slugging outfielder Sammy Sosa has not returned to Wrigley Field after the two sides experienced a nasty divorce following the 2004 season.\n[ Sign up for Yahoo Fantasy Baseball | 2017 Player Rankings ]\nIn an interview with former team media relations employee Chuck Wasserstrom, Sosa made it clear that he’s willing to reunite with the Cubs, but he’s not going to beg them to take him back.\n“I never say ‘No’ to that. I owe something to the people – to the crowd in Chicago. For that, I would come back. But I’m not going to go up there and say, ‘I’m here. Please bring me back and give me a chance.’ No way. I’m not hungry. I have too much pride. They know where they can find me.”\nFrom 1992 to 2004, Sosa was the face of the Cubs. He not only became a fan favorite within the franchise, but developed into one of the game’s most popular players following his home run chase with Mark McGwire. During this period, the stands in Wrigley Field were packed with Sosa jerseys.\nBut Sosa’s relationship with the team and fanbase deteriorated at the end of the 2004 season. After he was benched for the final game of the regular season, Sosa left the park before the contest even started. He was traded to the Baltimore Orioles that offseason.\nSosa expressed some regret over how that situation played out, telling Wasserstrom he never wanted to leave Chicago.\n“My intention was to finish my career in Chicago. That was my intention all the way. I never wanted to leave Chicago. I should have handled that situation differently, yes indeed. I recognize my mistake. But look, I have my pride, and I know I had a tremendous career in Chicago. When nobody knew who Chicago was, I put Chicago on the map.”\nSosa also addresses the rumors surrounding his suspected steroid use in the interview. He points out that he never failed a test, and then compares himself to Jesus Christ.\nIt’s like Jesus Christ when he came to Jerusalem. Everybody thought Jesus Christ was a witch ( laughing ) – and he was our savior. So if they talk [expletive] about Jesus Christ, what about me? Are you kidding me?”\nUltimately, the conversation turns back to Sosa returning to Wrigley Field. He again reiterates that he would gladly come back if the team asked.\n“If they send me an invitation, then I would definitely say ‘Yes.’ This is my house – no matter what happened (at the end). My numbers – nobody is going to take them from me. Not even Mr. Cub, Ernie Banks, hit that many home runs. And I did it with style ( laughing ). But if they invite me, why not? One day, if they invite me, a lot of people will be very happy about it.”\nSosa made similar comments in October, as the team was preparing for the World Series. At that time, he said he had not been in contact with anyone at the Cubs for at least three seasons .\nWhile it’s clear Sosa wouldn’t mind a reunion, there’s still some animosity toward him within the organization. In 2014, a team spokesperson said Sosa would have to make amends before the team invited him back.\nSince then, the organization has remained quiet about a reunion with Sosa. While it’s clear the former outfielder wouldn’t mind a return to Wrigley Field, the silence on the Cubs’ end speaks volumes.\nMore MLB coverage from Yahoo Sports:\n– – – – – – –\nChris Cwik is a writer for Big League Stew on Yahoo Sports.
