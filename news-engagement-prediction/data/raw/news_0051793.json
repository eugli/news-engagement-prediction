And though celebrity baby announcements aren&apos;t usually humorous, Amber obviously had a few laughs with hers.\n\"David and I are proud to announce the birth of our daughter,\" she wrote in the Instagram caption. \"Dauphinoise Petunia Brittany Scheherazade Von Funkinstein Mustard Witch RBG Cross Tamblyn-Bey Jr. #TheFutureIsFemale.\" Amber and David have yet to confirm that this is their daughter&apos;s actual name, but the possibility of the pair putting \"Mustard Witch\" on a birth certificate seems unlikely. Then again, it&apos;s become a kind of rite of passage for celebrities to pick obscure baby names—so maybe the new parents are satirizing that modern tradition?\nMore evidence that could be compiled toward that theory is the video posted along with the caption. Instead of posting a straightforward picture with her newborn girl—or just one of their daughter—the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants star posted an almost hilariously cryptic video of just her baby&apos;s foot.\nSee the announcement, below:\nLoading View on Instagram\nHowever, one thing that&apos;s no joking matter is the hashtag she included: #TheFutureIsFemale. Over the past year, Amber has been a vocal advocate of equal rights and female empowerment.\n\"How much do I have to do, as a daughter and a soon-to-be mother, to change not just the conversation about how women are seen, but the language with which conversations are spoken in?\" she questioned in an op-ed for Glamour penned last fall. \"I’ll be voting for a future for my daughter where conversations about our bodies and our lives are broader than what value they have for men. A future where being a mother is less about warning our daughters about our sons and is instead lifting them up to their greatest potential. A future where my girl will someday say, &apos;Donald who?&apos; and think nothing is revolutionary about a woman becoming President. A future where she can’t even believe that was ever even a thing.\"\nRELATED: Amber Tamblyn: Yes, Misogyny Exists", "external_links": ["https://www.instagram.com/p/BQyS0reFhMn/?taken-by=amberrosetamblyn"], "published": "2017-02-23T05:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:07:02.104+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
