During those endless summers – which always seem like they’ll last forever but never do – it doesn’t get better than a real-life juke box rotation of the songs performed live as you stand in the midst of thousands people who share the common goal of just having a good time.

Boutique hotels, shopping and dining are also a prominent fixture of the sleepy town. For those with concerns regarding bouts of political unrest in Egypt, El Gouna is far from the capital city of Cairo where many of the disturbances tend to occur. \nLocation: El Gouna, Egypt", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:51:51.782+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
