Kensington Palace/Twitter \nKate was playing alongside Craig, who takes part in the MIST center, which is run by one of Kate’s charities, Action for Children. Sadly for them, they were no match for their 15-year-old opponent Connor Goodacre. \nBut both boys were impressed by Kate, who was on hand to learn more about the center and their work to help vulnerable youth. \n“She was really interested in talking to us,” says Craig, who told Kate a story about his dog and was then given an update on the royal family’s pets, including cocker spaniel Lupo and Marvin the Hamster . \n“She was saying the dog was fine and that they also had a really small hamster,” Craig says. \nAs she left the center, two young girls Ypapanti Galimatakis, 8, and Chloe Bartlett, 10, handed her some flowers and asked about Prince George and Princess Charlotte — as Kate filled them in on their ages.
