The Swede has silenced all doubters by scoring 26 goals this term, including two in yesterday’s EFL Cup final victory over Southampton. Jurgen Klopp sends warning to his Liverpool flops after Leicester loss \nIbrahimovic is only tied to a one-year deal and there is some uncertainty over whether the 35-year-old will extend it for another season. The player himself says he will not make the decision until the current campaign is complete. However, he revealed he will quit while still performing at the peak of his powers. \nDiscussing what will influence his decision he said: ‘I mean the moment, how I feel, the situation, we have another two months of the season to go. \n‘I will stop on top. I will not play one game by being Ibrahimovic and for what I did before. If I don’t perform, if I don’t bring results, I will not play. \n‘I will not be like other players, playing because they make a great career and name and they are still playing because they are who they are. I will play as long as I can bring results.’ Ibrahimovic, Eric Bailly, Paul Pogba and Antonio Valencia with the trophy (Getty) \nManchester United might have won a trophy already but their chief aim this season is to return to the Champions League. They currently lie sixth in the Premier League, two points short of the qualification places. Ibrahimovic though insists whether they qualify for Europe’s top tournament will have no bearing on his decision. \n‘No, it’s not about that. I came here and the club wasn’t in the Champions League. So it had nothing to do with the Champions League. \n‘Somebody made up a story that if they don’t qualify for the Champions League I will not extend. It has nothing to do with that.
