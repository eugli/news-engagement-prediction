(Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune) Scott R. Gryder \nI read with frustration and disappointment a recent Chicago Tribune editorial titled \" Wake up, Illinois. You're surrounded. \" The lines where my slow burn turned to flame were the rhetorical questions: \"When will Illinois lawmakers recognize the house is on fire? When will they make job creation, retention, their do-or-die priority?\" The broken system in Illinois isn't competing with neighboring states; rather, Illinois is ripe with intrastate competition left unaddressed by Springfield. \nConsider the recent news about Caterpillar's Aurora plant, which the company is contemplating closing. The plant was built during a golden age for American manufacturing jobs in 1957 and once employed more than 6,000 employees. At one point the facility was the largest employer in northern Illinois. While the number of jobs has shrunk to 2,000, of which 800 could be lost in this possible restructure, it remains the largest employer in Kendall County and one of the largest in the region. \nTale after tale can be told of the tremendous impact this facility has had on our community. And now it's possible the new tales will be about employees who lost their jobs and the impact on their lives and their communities. Caterpillar should not sugarcoat any bad news with feeble attempts to say it did everything it could to keep jobs in Aurora. In truth, if Caterpillar eliminates jobs, it will have a negative ripple effect on employment throughout Kendall County. \nThis is a day of reckoning and it should light a fire underneath all of us. For years we've heard Illinois businesses make the case that competing in the state is painfully difficult. When I was elected to the Kendall County Board a few years ago, I spoke to a Caterpillar representative who said that workers' compensation reform was critical to the company's survival in this state. Yet nothing has been done. Caterpillar's recent earnings report indicates it is not in an expansion mode when it comes to manufacturing. I'm struggling to comprehend how hundreds of workers could be taken on at plants in Decatur or North Little Rock, Ark., but Caterpillar can't sustain jobs in Aurora. Is it because of the enterprise zone incentives in Decatur? Or Arkansas' \"right-to-work\" status? \nJust as galling are the headlines announcing Caterpillar's decision to relocate its global headquarters to the Chicago area. This is considered a victory for the region, with good reason; however, we can't forget about the 800 men and women who may lose their Aurora-based jobs. We should be putting up a fight. Remember the 1,600 jobs lost when Office Max moved to Florida? Don't forget about the 500 people who got pink slips when General Mills left West Chicago. Ditto for the 400 good-paying Kenall Manufacturing jobs that crossed the border in 2015 to Wisconsin from Gurnee, where the commercial lighting manufacturer got a better deal. To add more salt to the wound, Kenall's new Kenosha facility is expected to create about 200 new jobs by 2018. These are jobs that should have stayed in Illinois. \nI think we can all agree, enough is enough. \nI am calling on Gov. Bruce Rauner and the Illinois General Assembly to stop the petty politicking and start thinking about our communities and our families. You were part of the problem, but it's not too late to become a part of the solution. Because doing nothing will undoubtedly lead to more Illinois residents without jobs. \nAs the Tribune correctly points out, Illinois needs a jobs rebound, a dramatic change in strategy and ambitious, pro-business reforms that incentivize employers to stay here and hire. \nIt's time for Illinois to get back in the game, to be that crown jewel of the Midwest that I believe it is. It's time to move the state forward. \nScott R. Gryder is chairman of the Kendall County Board.
