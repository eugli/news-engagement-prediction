PwC aplogized twice for the awkward mix-up. The Academy also placed blame on the firm The second apology by PwC said: 'PwC takes full responsibility for the series of mistakes and breaches of established protocols during last night’s Oscars.' 'PwC partner Brian Cullinan mistakenly handed the back-up envelope for Actress in a Leading Role instead of the envelope for Best Picture to presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway. Once the error occurred, protocols for correcting it were not followed through quickly enough by Mr. Cullinan or his partner.' The Academy also placed blame on the firm and released its own apology statement. The statement published on Medium read: 'We deeply regret the mistakes that were made during the presentation of the Best Picture category during last night’s Oscar ceremony. 'We apologize to the entire cast and crew of La La Land and Moonlight whose experience was profoundly altered by this error. We salute the tremendous grace they displayed under the circumstances. To all involved — including our presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway, the filmmakers, and our fans watching worldwide — we apologize.' Writer and director of Moonlight, Barry Jenkins, holds his Oscar and speaks to the crowd after being awarded the Best Picture Academy Award The horror, the horror: The stunned crowd looks on as it was revealed the wrong name had been read. Matt Damon's (left of center row) jaw literally dropped when he heard the news, while Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson (right) looked almost angry at what was happening. Ben Affleck (front right) had his head turned towards where the Moonlight team was sitting, while legendary actor Meryl Streep (bottom right) was leaning forward in her chair with a stupefied look on her face 'For the last 83 years, the Academy has entrusted PwC to handle the critical tabulation process, including the accurate delivery of results. PwC has taken full responsibility for the breaches of established protocols that took place during the ceremony. 'We have spent last night and today investigating the circumstances, and will determine what actions are appropriate going forward. We are unwaveringly committed to upholding the integrity of the Oscars and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.' Hours after the envelope switch, Pwc released an apology for the error. In the heart-stopping moment, the stars and producers of La La Land were stopped midway through their acceptance speeches and forced to hand their trophies to the stars of Moonlight after their film was announced as Best Picture in one of the biggest blunders in Oscar history. The first apology by PwC read: 'We sincerely apologize to Moonlight, La La Land, Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, and Oscar viewers for the error that was made during the award announcement for Best Picture. 'The presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope and when discovered, was immediately corrected. We are currently investigating how this could have happened, and deeply regret that this occurred. 'We appreciate the grace with which the nominees, the Academy, ABC, and Jimmy Kimmel handled the situation.'
