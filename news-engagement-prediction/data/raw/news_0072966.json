Credit Wyatt McSpadden Gary Cartwright, a longtime Texas journalist whose sharp writing, fearless reporting and fast living established him as one of the state’s greatest nonfiction writers and a kind of Lone Star cousin to Hunter S. Thompson, died on Wednesday in Austin, Tex. He was 82. His death, in a hospital hospice unit, was confirmed by the author Jan Reid, a friend. Friends said Mr. Cartwright had fallen recently inside his home in Austin, where he lived alone, and was unable to reach a phone. He remained there for days before he was discovered and taken to the hospital, they said. Mr. Cartwright was the dean of a loose-knit class of Texas journalists who pushed the bounds of long-form journalism and helped bring national acclaim to the regional magazine some of them wrote for, Texas Monthly. His career with the magazine began with the first issue, in 1973, and continued to his retirement in 2010. He practiced the brand of irreverent, participatory storytelling that Mr. Thompson had made famous as “gonzo journalism.” “He was definitely our version of Hunter Thompson as much as anybody,” said Evan Smith, the chief executive of The Texas Tribune and a former editor in chief of Texas Monthly. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Cartwright wrote a 1998 memoir about his life-changing heart attack, mused in print about the con man who was the best man at his wedding (his second of four) and described his sex life as an elderly man in the pages of Texas Monthly. “One of the best stories ever that Cartwright wrote, or that the magazine published, was one of Cartwright’s first stories,” Mr. Smith said. “It was about Jay J. Armes , a private detective in El Paso who literally had hooks for arms. You cannot make this up.” In the weeks leading up to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963, the Dallas apartment that Mr. Cartwright shared with his friend and fellow reporter, Bud Shrake, was a popular late-night hangout for, among others, Jack Ruby and one of Ruby’s favorite strippers, Jada. Mr. Ruby, the nightclub owner who shot Lee Harvey Oswald, was a recurring figure in Mr. Cartwright’s journalism. As Mr. Cartwright wrote in “Confessions of a Washed-up Sportswriter” (1983), “On the morning of the assassination, Ruby called our apartment and asked if we’d seen Jada.” Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
