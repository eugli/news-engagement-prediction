Governor Ambode has plans to ban the yellow Danfo buses that have added colour to the ever bustling and bubbling city. File photo of Governor Ambode. Akinwumi Ambode, the governor of Lagos state has made known his plans to phase out the popular Danfo buses from the streets of Lagos in order to change the outlook of the megacity. While this is considered to be a major event that will have a long term impact on the lives of Lagosians and people living outside the ever-lively state, the governor is bent on bringing change to the state and making an impact during his tenure as the state governor. The yellow buses that have been long associated with Lagos may soon become history if Governor Ambode pulls through with his plan. Check out the reasons why the Lagos state governor is taking the yellow buses off Lagos roads: 1. To give way to a world-class transport system Governor Ambode explained that taking the yellow buses away would give way to a more efficient, well-structured and world-class mass transport system that will boost the movement of people within the city. Keeping the Danfo buses on the road will muddle up the arrangement and functionality of the mass-transport system that would be launched in the state.

Danfo buses are not acceptable and befitting The Lagos state governor revealed that the Danfo transport system operating in Lagos does not befit the megacity and is totally unacceptable. This was made known at the 14th annual lecture of the centre for values in leadership held at the Muson Centre in Onikan. This point was revealed when the governor was speaking on ‘The challenge of Africa’s future cities.’ READ ALSO: Nigerians will do all or any of these things in the absence of President Buhari 3. The current transport system is a faulty connectivity Another reason the popular yellow buses would be phased out is that Lagos is running a faulty connectivity in terms of transport systems. The governor expressed his dismay at seeing yellow buses, Okadas and tricycles on the roads every day. He said in as much as this transport system is in use, then Lagos claiming to be a megacity is a false claim. Placing the ban on the yellow buses will help people move around with ease. This is the governor’s main goal! Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T16:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T17:20:38.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
