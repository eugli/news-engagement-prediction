Strong winds are forecast to impact southern areas of Ireland on Sunday 26 February. \nAlthough Sunday will be a windy day in the UK, the same level of impacts are not expected to be seen across England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. \nIn the UK, a Yellow National Severe Weather Warning for wind has been issued for north west Wales, north west England and eastern parts of Scotland as strong gusts of wind are expected between 11:00 on Sunday morning through to 06:00 on Monday morning. Wind gusts of 50-60 mph could be seen in isolated locations in land with the potential for up to 70 mph in exposed coastal locations within the warning area. These expected wind gust speeds are much lower than those seen with Storm Doris earlier in the week. \nChief Meteorologist Eddy Carroll said: “Sunday will be a wet and windy day in the UK, especially in the north and west, however the impacts are unlikely to be at same level as could occur in Ireland. Whilst there is still some uncertainty, the wind speeds forecast for the UK on Sunday are very unlikely to be of the same strength we saw earlier in the week with Storm Doris.” \nAs always keep up to date with the weather using our forecast pages, Twitter or Facebook , as well as using our new mobile app which is available for iPhone from the App store and for Android from the Google Play store .
