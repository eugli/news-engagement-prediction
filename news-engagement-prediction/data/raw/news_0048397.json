This win coincides with a renaissance for Gordon with the Houston Rockets this season, and it must have been nice to shut down the critics in the crowd with the clutch win. The coolest part of the event, however, may have taken place after the \"official\" event ended. Turner's Craig Sager was honored with a star-studded performance involving DJ Khaled, Anthony Anderson, James Harden, and more all coming out of the crowd to shoot threes in honor of the Sager Strong Foundation. The crew earned $130,000 in a minute at $10,000 a shot, producing a touching moment during the usually goofy festivities: \nA very special moment at # NBAAllStar — NBA on TNT ( @NBAonTNT ) February 19, 2017 Steph Curry had a chance to bump it to $500,000 with a series of halfcourt shots, but he was unable to come up big in the clutch.
