Chief executives of major U.S. corporations - including Dow Chemical Co, Lockheed Martin and US Steel - are seen behind him\nThese teams will take aim at regulations deemed burdensome to the economy and will designate regulatory reform officers within 60 days. Trump claims the Obama administration cost the government billions due to regulatory orders\n'Excessive regulation is killing jobs, driving companies out of our country like never before,' Trump said before signing the order.\n'Every regulation should have to pass a simple test; does it make life better or safer for American workers or consumers?'\nThe effort is part of a Republican push to undo many of the actions of former President Barack Obama, who left office last month after two four-year terms.\nIn 1981, President Ronald Reagan created a presidential task force on regulatory relief but that effort did not establish task forces at the cabinet level.\nOther presidents including Bill Clinton and George W. Bush carried out attempts to reduce or streamline government regulations.\nTrump's order requires agencies to 'measure and report progress in achieving the presidentÂ´s directives.' Each task force will make recommendations on which regulations to repeal or simplify, Trump said.\nThe order says agencies should seek to repeal regulations that 'inhibit job creation,' are 'ineffective,' impose costs that exceed benefits or 'create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with regulatory initiatives and policies.'\nScott Slesinger, legislative director at the Natural Resources Defense Council environmental group, said 'this order is a directive to kill the safeguards Americans depend on for clean air, drinkable water and safe food.'\nRobert Verchick, president of the Center for Progressive Reform, a think tank, criticized Trump's new order as 'clearly aimed at embedding his overtly political, anti-protections agenda at federal agencies that are supposed to be using science and expertise to safeguard us all.'\nTrump said: 'Excessive regulation is killing jobs, driving companies out of our country like never before.' The effort is part of a Republican push to undo many of the actions of former President Barack Obama, who left office last month after two four-year terms\nTrump on Friday said the United States does not need '75 per cent of the repetitive, horrible regulations that hurt companies, hurt jobs.'\nThe Republican has vowed a sweeping cut in U.S. regulations and previously ordered agencies to repeal two rules for every new one adopted.\nAn order Trump signed in January sets an annual cap on the cost of new regulations but does not apply to most financial reform rules introduced by the Obama administration.\nTrump said Obama executive orders from the cost $873bn. The Obama administration said the benefits of its regulations to the public far outweighed the costs\nTrump's chief strategist Steve Bannon told a gathering of conservatives on Thursday that deregulation, which he called 'the deconstruction of the administrative state,' was a top priority for the administration.\nThe Trump administration says executive orders from the previous government cost hundreds of billions of dollars. The Obama administration said the benefits of those regulations to the public far outweighed the costs.\nThe White House said the Obama administration finalized more than 3,000 regulations that cost taxpayers $873bn, Fox News reported.\nMany of those were required by Congress.\nU.S. Chamber of Commerce senior vice president Neil Bradley praised the Trump administration for 'tackling the regulatory state head on.... We look forward to working with the federal agencies to help identify rules that harm the economy and threaten jobs.'\nThe Trump administration also ordered a freeze on regulations pending review and has stopped some regulations from taking effect.", "external_links": ["http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/02/24/trump-orders-new-task-force-push-to-eliminate-red-tape.html", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-24T16:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T07:54:35.327+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
