Ubl, chief executive of PhRMA.\nAmgen chief executive, Robert Brad, said in the meeting that his firm would add 1,600 jobs in the US - a move welcomed by the president.", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1661F/production/_93897619_trumppharmareuters.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-01T01:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:55:41.581+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
