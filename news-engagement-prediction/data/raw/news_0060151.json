(1233 ABC Newcastle: Robert Virtue) \nMr Turnbull's family has farmed land around Gresford since the mid-1940s, and he is now running low on water and feed for his dairy cattle herd. \n\"Water at the moment, we're running on a creek. We've had to cut right back. We haven't irrigated any of the farm since November out of the creek,\" he said. \n\"We have done a little bit of irrigating out of our irrigation dam, but that's gone down pretty well now. \n\"We're virtually just trying to save the water that's in the creek now for stock and domestic [use]. \n\"The gardens are gone. The beloved vegie patch has gone by the wayside. It's fairly critical. \n\"It's hard to use that dreaded D word, but yeah I think this area would be in drought. \n\"If it's not a drought, it's a damn-bad spell.\" \nThe last good rainfall in the Gresford area was in July. \nMr Turnbull said thunderstorms that had rolled in had, by-and-large, missed his pocket of the region. \n\"It's pretty concerning. We've used all our conserved fodder that we save up for winter,\" he said. \n\"[In] the next couple of weeks, we'll be buying semi-trailer loads of hay, and we've also had to buy in water to put through the machines at the dairy.\" Dry conditions a second hit for farmer \nFor Mr Turnbull, the extended dry spell comes on top of being caught-up in last year's dairy price wars . \nLate last year he was receiving on average $0.40 per litre for his milk. \nThat price has now risen, but it is still not enough. \n\"That 52 cents is still two or three cents below our average price for the 12 months before. It's still going to be difficult,\" Mr Turnbull said. \n\"Any extra money that you're making at the moment is going straight back into buying grain or buying hay.\" Community rallying in time of need \nFor those living and working in the area, the dry spell is the talk of the town. \n\"Everybody gets together and talks about it. It's just rural life,\" Mr Turnbull said. \n\"Everybody sticks together and if somebody needs a hand, well they've only got to ask and people will be there to help. \n\"Maybe you keep [the farm] going for the kids and the grandkids, and you find a way to work through things. \n\"You've got to be able to communicate to other people, talk to other people. If you bottle it all up and didn't talk to other farmers or other friends, it'd be pretty hard.\" \nMr Turnbull said 200–300 millimetres of soaking rain over a few weeks would turn the situation around. \n\"I don't know if there's much that people can do. Do rain dances or something like that for us,\" he said. \n\"It's just one of those things that happens in Australia, out in the country.\" Photo: The Allyn River at Gresford is drying up. (1233 ABC Newcastle: Robert Virtue) Is it a drought? \nHunter Local Land Services district veterinarian Digby Raywood said officially declaring an area as being in drought was old terminology. \n\"The old terminology of officially declaring an area drought — they are then eligible for some transport subsidies,\" he said. \n\"So we're not actually officially declared drought because that declaration goes on a council-whole area. \n\"But certainly that district up there [Gresford], in my interpretation is drought-affected, there's no doubt about it.\" \nMr Raywood said Local Land Services ran information days to support affected farmers. \n\"All we try and advise people is, get prepared for it. Doing nothing is not an option,\" he said. \n\"A beef guy has got some more options, they're able to sell their stock off. \n\"The dairy guys are locked in to producing milk, and so their options are very limited, and their cost of production goes through the roof. \n\"They are in desperate times.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T06:05:13.324+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
