So it's not surprising that both superstar musicians topped the list of most-talked-about moments on Twitter and Facebook. \nAdele's victory in the top two categories topped Facebook's list of the top five most-talked-about Grammy moments on its platform. \nHer record of the year win was also the second most discussed moment on Twitter. The top Twitter moment, in its list of three, was the end of Beyonce's regal performance. Beyonce's live rendition of \"Love Drought\" and \"Sand Castles\" was also the third most talked-about moment on Facebook. \nAdele made a second appearance on both Twitter and Facebook's top lists, with her George Michael tribute as the third most discussed moment of the show on Twitter and fourth most popular on Facebook. \nLady Gaga and Metallica's performance and Bruno Mars'\"What I Like\" performance rounded out Facebook's list as the second and fifth most talked-about moments respectively. \nTwitter also listed the five most tweeted-about stars of the night, with Beyonce and Adele in the top two spots, in that order, followed by, Rihanna, Chance the Rapper and Lady Gaga.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T04:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:29:32.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
