The meaning of Islam is peace.' Many Muslims resent any mention of Islam in association with terrorism, arguing those who commit crimes purportedly in the name of Islam have nothing to do with a religion that espouses peace. Mr Erdogan said it would be 'saddening' if the term was used because of the crimes of ISIS, which has been blamed for a string of attacks in Turkey over the last year. 'Please let's not use it. As long as it is used we need to stand against it. As a Muslim president personally I cannot accept that,' he said. Mrs Merkel visited the presidential palace in Ankara today to talk to Mr Erdogan about a number of issues but there was a noticeably cool atmosphere between the pair The awkward moment between the pair came after they had tackled a series of hugely sensitive issues at a time of rising tensions between Ankara and Berlin. His response delighted the Turkish press, with the Yeni Safak daily headlining on its website: 'President Erdogan's warning to Merkel'. The phrase is controversial and previous US president Barack Obama refused to use the phrase 'Islamic terrorism', saying such crimes distorted and perverted Islam. But new President Donald Trump has not shied away from using the term, speaking of 'radical Islamic terror' during the election campaign and condemning his predecessor for not using the term. Erdogan's AKP party was elected on an Islamic platform and has done its best to roll back the secular culture which has been adopted by Turkey since the founder of the modern state, Kemal Ataturk, came to power in the 1920s. Ataturk remains a revered figure in Turkey and his image remains ever present in the country but he would not have seen eye to eye with Erdogan on many issues.
