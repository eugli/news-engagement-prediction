I’m not just talking about Milo Yiannopoulos’s own apparent defense of pedophilia, but the reactions of the people who enabled and promoted him.\nThere are weeks when it is not possible – as it has been in earlier editions of this column – to bring to light thoughtful conservative perspectives, and to highlight areas of common ground. This is one of those weeks. Those who aren’t trying to blame Milo’s nihilism on the targets of Milo’s abuse are shiftily backing away, or using it as an opportunity to redouble their own attacks on those who happen to share Milo’s sexuality.\nYet this, too, is useful. Now and then we need to remind ourselves that human values really do diverge sharply. It’s not just a misunderstanding that we can talk through. A hatred of marginalized people really does animate some conservative minds, and a love of hierarchy may be baked into all of them. We can only really get a full sense of this by reading what they write, and taking them at their word.\nBully Culture Publication: Fencing Bear at Prayer\nAuthor: Rachel Fulton Brown is, believe it or not, an associate professor of medieval history at the University of Chicago. She has indulged in her Milo fandom previously on Breitbart , and, more surprisingly, on the institutional blog of the university’s divinity school.\nWhy you should read it: When I saw Milo Yiannopoulos perform at the University of Oregon, the only thing that shocked me in his dreary performance was his sincere, vituperative misogyny, which was mostly reserved for feminists. But he also had ample insults and calumnies to hand out to Muslims, academics, and other assorted enemies. It’s bizarre to read Brown’s argument that somehow this person was the victim of bullying, when it seems pretty clear that everything that happened to him was as a result of his own artless provocations.\nAs has been widely remarked, the right was happy as long as these provocations were directed at their favored scapegoats, but pedophilia was a bridge too far. Nevertheless, this is what Fulton – a woman with a graduate degree and academic publications – wants us to accept. Clearly, we can’t put this down to stupidity. So it is worth reading to understand the kind of people who made Milo possible, and just how different are the frameworks of morals and values that we in this country inhabit.\nExtract : “And so the bullies came for him. They called him self-hating. Homophobic. Transphobic. Misogynist. Sexist. They mounted protests against his talks. They accused him of spreading hate. Endangering innocents. Inciting violence. They made him out to be the villain because he told the truth. And then they called him a pedophile. Because he had been abused as a young teenager and would not swallow the lies.”\nThe Rage Against the Machine: Understanding the Milo Phenomenon Publication: National Review\nAuthor: National Review’s David French, fresh from complaining about “alt-right” harassment in the wake of his abortive presidential bid, is here to tell you that Milo, and his following, are really all the left’s fault.\nWhy you should read: David French argues that the left’s dominance of cultural and educational institutions is so complete that it has led to conservatives putting their faith in people like Milo and Trump, who offer a vent for all of their “pent-up frustrations at liberal arrogance and ignorance”. Being David French, he doesn’t entertain the idea that the Republican party and conservative media played any part in this by relentlessly stoking rank-and-file resentment for eight long years under the Obama presidency. Put that aside, and read this as a study in rationalization.\nExtract: “People have deep and understandable affection for those they believe are effectively fighting for them. That’s the source of the bond between lawyer and client, between a politician and his base. That’s the source of the bond between Milo and his followers. He is ‘fearless’. He ‘destroys’ feminists in the same way that John Oliver ‘destroys’ Fox News. Fight the enemy, and your fans will forgive a multitude of failures.”\nIs Milo Promoting Child Rape? Publication: Infowars\nAuthor: Alex Jones, trying hard to process the downfall of someone to whom he and his acolytes have previously offered full-throated support.\nWhy you should watch it: No one is more preoccupied with celebrity pedophilia than Alex Jones, who constantly talks about it as one of the things binding together a vast “globalist” conspiracy. Watch him dance around the fact that a fellow-traveler has been brought low by appearing to endorse it. Does Milo have “Stockholm syndrome”? Is it all because the evil “fakestream” media is going after conservatives? Is it the Deep State? Mr Jones never really seems to settle on an answer.\nExtract : From 3:54 , watch Jones try to subtly distance himself from Milo, go off on an ill-advised tangent about his sexuality, and finally start talking about how he likes oysters.\nThe Milo Temptation\nPublication: The Bridgehead\nAuthor: Johnathan Van Maren is a conservative Christian broadcaster and writer. He is also someone who lives in a moral and political universe not used to accommodating gay men as allies.\nWhy you should read it: Van Maren, writing last December after evangelicals had plumped for Trump, shows us the developing conservative ambivalence about Yiannopoulos, which would culminate in them cutting him loose. On the one hand, Milo was useful because he smote their enemies – us. On the other, his flamboyance, his profanity, and above all his sexuality meant that the Christian right would never be completely at ease with him.\nVan Maven’s unease is a symptom of tensions in the jerry-built and somewhat incoherent Trump coalition. It offers a clue as to why we see conservatives turning on conservatives, even in their moment of victory. If you didn’t know better, the last week might even resemble the beginnings of a purge.\nExtract: “I do understand the driving urge to destroy a system of speech codes that was designed to convict those on the Right from the very beginning. And to destroy political correctness we needed to tear down a large number of recently-constructed fences. But it appears we have gone on a bit of a fence-smashing binge, and we’re forgetting that some fences were erected for a reason. Zeal to correct errors can turn into iconoclasm with such lightning speed that we don’t even notice it until we hear the glass breaking, or listen as a room full of so-called conservatives laughs wildly at an entertainer calling actresses he disagrees with the c-word. Milo may style himself as a dangerous intellectual presenting compelling points in a risqué fashion, but after the fourth or fifth crude joke the room at Michigan State seemed to resemble a Safe Space for Bro Culture.”\nWhy Conservatives Fell for Milo Yiannopoulos Publication: The Daily Beast\nAuthor: Matt Lewis has a prime résumé in conservative punditry, having written at Townhall.com, Human Events, and The Daily Caller. He also shows up on TV shows such as Real Time with Bill Maher, which attracted criticism last week for giving a platform to a prelapsarian Milo .\nWhy you should read: Lewis is clearly bothered by Yiannopoulos’s sexuality – he calls him “depraved and decadent” and mentions, with discomfort, his stated enthusiasm for “black dick”. But he does make a good point about the reason that someone like Milo could entrance a movement which is, even now, frequently strident in its homophobia. For one thing, “he brings a certain cosmopolitan flair to a group of people accustomed to being thought of as unsophisticated”. But mostly, it’s just because the left hates him. This is what conservatism has come to.\nExtract: “True conservatism has been replaced by a fetish for fighting political correctness. Along with a penchant for showmanship, this seems to be Yiannopoulos’s entire shtick – and it’s a good one. The enemy of your enemy is your friend, and since Yiannopoulos says horrible things about radical feminists and other annoying leftists, he is, ergo, a conservative hero. This was the initial message from [Matt] Schlapp [the head of the group behind CPAC]. Before rescinding Yiannopoulos’s invitation (in response to a critical tweet from conservative writer Jonah Goldberg), Schlapp said the ‘1st amendment is dead on campus. Conservatives should fight back. As radioactive as milo is he is fighting back’.”\nUS press and publishing Burst your bubble features Share Reuse this content", "external_links": ["http://www.npr.org/2016/10/26/499440089/harassed-on-twitter-people-need-to-know-the-reality-of-what-its-like-out-there", "https://thebridgehead.ca/2016/12/08/the-milo-temptation/", "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/02/20/why-conservatives-fell-for-milo-yiannopoulos.html", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2017%2Ffeb%2F23%2Fmilo-yiannopulos-conservative-articles-to-read%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_fb", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2017%2Ffeb%2F23%2Fmilo-yiannopulos-conservative-articles-to-read%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_gp&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;wwc=1", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/find/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2017%2Ffeb%2F23%2Fmilo-yiannopulos-conservative-articles-to-read", "http://fencingbearatprayer.blogspot.com/2017/02/bully-culture.html", "https://youtu.be/uwLiU6YqeBs?t=3m54s", "https://divinity.uchicago.edu/sightings/why-milo-scares-students-and-faculty-even-more", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Burst%20your%20bubble%3A%20five%20conservative%20articles%20examining%20Milo%20Yiannopoulos&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2017%2Ffeb%2F23%2Fmilo-yiannopulos-conservative-articles-to-read%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_tw", "http://www.nationalreview.com/article/445114/milo-phenomenon-understanding-right-wing-rage", "http://www.alternet.org/activism/depaul-university-tour-shut-down-protestors", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&title=Burst%20your%20bubble%3A%20five%20conservative%20articles%20examining%20Milo%20Yiannopoulos&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2017%2Ffeb%2F23%2Fmilo-yiannopulos-conservative-articles-to-read", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwLiU6YqeBs", "http://www.breitbart.com/milo/2016/12/01/establishment-conservatives-guide-to-milo/"], "published": "2017-02-24T00:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:17:52.305+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
