Matt Thomas, spokesman for the ODU NAACP, told The Virginia-Pilot that the video was even more offensive because it was posted during Black History month. At one point, the 'rapper' put out a cigarette on a piece of paper that said 'Black Lives Matter' In the opening of the two-and-a-half minute video, the user broadcasted the phrase in all capital letters, 'N HISTORY MONTH'. Thomas said: 'To be honest, I didn't finish the video the first time I watched it. I was trying to process what I heard. 'It's scary to know that in 2017, I could be sitting next to someone in class who wants to see me back on a plantation or hung.' At one point, the 'rapper' put out a cigarette on a piece of paper that said 'Black Lives Matter'. The rhetoric of the video encouraged the killing of black people, and support of President Donald Trump. The woman rapping in the video wore a t-shirt with Donald Trump's face emblazoned with the phrase 'My President is White'.
