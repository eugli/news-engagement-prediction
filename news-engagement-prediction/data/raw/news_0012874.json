Latest odds and predictions Will Ukip win the Stoke-on-Trent by-election 2017? Latest odds and predictions UKIP leader Paul Nutall has a good chance of winning the Stoke-on-Trent Central by-election later this month. Here are the latest odds and predictions. PUBLISHED: 17:19, Tue, Feb 7, 2017 | UPDATED: 17:39, Tue, Feb 7, 2017 Getty PA Could Ukip leader Paul Nuttall win the Stoke-on-Trent Central by-election? \nThe MEP recently won the Ukip leadership contest and now has his sights fixed on winning the contest in the traditional Labour stronghold. \nUkip are the second favourite to win the Stoke-on-Trent Central seat and are close behind Labour with less than three weeks to go until the by-election. \nVoters are among some of the the most Eurosceptic in the UK, with nearly 70 per cent of voters in Stoke-on-Trent backing Brexit during the EU referendum. Related articles Ukip leader Paul Nuttall mocks Labour as a 'complete SHAMBLES' \nThe by-election will be a test of whether Labour’s disunity over Brexit and Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership will harm the party at the ballot box. \nMr Nuttall told Express.co.uk that victory in Stoke-on-Trent Central would \"open up a can of worms\" for Labour as other seats \"could fall like dominoes\" to Ukip. \nLabour has held on to the seat since its creation in 1950 but its majority has dropped from nearly 20,000 a decade ago to just 5,000 in 2015. \nA Paddy Power spokesman said: “We price UKIP at even money to win the Stoke-on-Trent by-election which, in English, means they’re a 50-50 shot. \n“They’re behind Labour in the betting, but only just – and they’re certainly popular with our punters. \n“It looks like being a by-election that’ll come down to the wire, and I really wouldn’t be surprised to see UKIP take the seat.” \nThe tough contest has been triggered by the resignation of Labour’s former shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt in January. \nMr Hunt is taking over as a the Victoria Albert Museum, leaving Labour with a tough contest at a time when it is deeply divided. Getty Nigel Farage and Paul Nuttall were egged on the campaign trail in Stoke-on-Trent \nThe divisions in the Labour Party were clearly seen when 47 pro-EU MPs rebelled against Mr Corbyn’s order to back the Brexit bill. \nThe young Labour candidate Gareth Snell voted to Remain in the EU referendum but has confirmed that he will not “frustrate the triggering of Article 50”. \nThe Tories held on to the Sleaford and North Hykeham seat during a by-election in December despite most of the population voting to leave the EU. \nThe by-election posed a stark contrast to another by-election in Richmond Park where a vast majority of people voted Remain in the referendum. \nThe pro-EU Liberal Democrat candidate Sarah Olney won the by-election after promising to vote against Article 50 - the step that kicks off Brexit talks. \nWhat are the latest odds for the Stoke-on-Trent Central by-election?
