Source: Supplied \nDespite being funded by Norway, the vault is managed by international organisation Crop Trust and has designated places for every nation on the planet to provide seedlings of native species.\nThe countries that contributed to the latest addition include Benin, India, Pakistan, Lebanon, Morocco, the Netherlands, the US, Mexico, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Belarus, and the UK.\n“Today’s seed deposit at Svalbard supported by The Crop Trust shows that despite political and economic differences in other arenas, collective efforts to conserve crop diversity and produce a global food supply for tomorrow continue to be strong,” said Marie Haga, executive director of the Crop Trust.\n“Nearly every country has agreed on the importance on conserving crop diversity through Target 2.5 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals to conserve agricultural diversity in seed collections,” she added.\nMajor seed deposit to Svalbard Seed Vault today incl. return of seeds from 1st withdrawal by ICARDA: https://t.co/mQock0llQQ #seeds4tomorrow pic.twitter.com/g2dv8SYmpD \n— The Crop Trust (@CropTrust) February 22, 2017 Snow blows off the Svalbard Global Seed Vault before being inaugurated at sunrise in February 2008. Picture: John McConnico Source: AP \nThe vault currently holds nearly a million different varieties of seeds originating from almost every country in the world — including North Korea.\nSeed samples for some of the world’s most vital food sources like the potato, sorghum, rice, barley, chickpea, lentil and wheat will be deposited at Svalbard in the coming days, bringing the total number of seed samples at the facility to 930,821.\nDespite this large collection, the vault is far from capacity.\n“The Seed Vault has the capacity to store 4.5 million varieties of crops. Each variety will contain on average 500 seeds, so a maximum of 2.5 billion seeds may be stored,” the Crop Trust website says.\nIn order to prevent contamination, seed samples are shipped to the island in large boxes, where they are scanned with X-rays to ensure the contents are safe.\nTo protect its assets, the vault comes equipped with five doors with coded locks, which are only accessible by only a few people in the world.\nAn armed guard walks through the Svalbard Global Seed Vault.
