The process is intended to enhance food safety by reducing salmonella, E. coli and other dangerous bacteria. \nREAD MORE: What is irradiated beef and is it healthy? \nHealth Canada announced the changes to Canada’s Food and Drug Regulations Wednesday. \nCritics of irradiated food say it produces toxic compounds, like benzene or toluene, and reduces the nutritional value of food while also changing the taste of meat. \nOfficials say such concerns were taken into consideration. \n“Health Canada developed the new regulations after conducting a thorough assessment, and concluded that irradiation is a safe and effective treatment to reduce harmful bacteria in ground beef.” \nWATCH: What you need to know about irradiated beef \nIrradiation does not replace any current food safety standards, rather is “another tool to be used to maintain food safety,” the agency states. \nThe new regulations do not require that Canadian ground beef be irradiated, simply that it is allowed to be. Irradiated beef will be required to be labelled as such. \nREAD MORE: Canadian beef industry reduces environmental hoofprint \nIrradiated food maintains its nutritional value, texture, taste and appearance, the release notes. The process is already used in Canada on a number of foods including potatoes, onions and flour. \nThe U.S. has permitted irradiation of beef since 1999, as do 60 other countries worldwide, the agency states. \n— With a file from Andrew Russell © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
