In a statement the White House initially called it \"outrageous\", before withdrawing that description. \nThe executive order caused chaos when it was suddenly introduced a week ago - some travellers arriving in the US were turned back, and protests broke out at airports across the country. The Seattle judge issued his order on the grounds that the travel ban could be unconstitutional - an argument that could be challenged all the way to the Supreme Court. \nAn estimated 60,000 people from the seven countries affected had their visas cancelled because of the ban. The customs department said those visas would now be reissued, and the people involved were free to travel to the US. \nThe lawsuit against President Trump's ban was initially filed by Washington State, with Minnesota joining later. \nWashington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson described the ban as unconstitutional. \n\"Folks who had visas, folks who were allowed to travel were denied that right without any due process whatsoever - that's un-American and unconstitutional,\" he said in a BBC interview. \nThe order, Mr Ferguson added, also violated freedom of religion rights. \"You cannot prefer one religion over another,\" he told the BBC. \nCourts in at least four other states - Virginia, New York, Massachusetts and Michigan - are hearing cases challenging Mr Trump's executive order. \nWere you unable to travel to the US due to President Trump's ban but intend to fly now there after this ruling?
