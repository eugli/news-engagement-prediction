(HT Photo) \nPolice said a resident of Bhopal – who made headlines earlier this week for allegedly killing his live-in partner and constructing a marble structure at his home to conceal her body – may have also murdered his parents seven years ago. \nSub-inspector Ramesh Rai said Udyan Das confessed during an interrogation session that he had murdered his parents and buried their bodies at a house in Shanti Nagar, Raipur, in 2010. He reportedly felt disturbed by the “parental interference” in his life. \n“We have been informed that Das killed his parents here in Shanti Nagar. We will exhume their remains tomorrow in the presence of the Bhopal police and a forensic team,” said Raipur inspector general (IG) Pradeep Gupta.

Police have since broken the structure and exhumed the victim’s remains. \nThe IG said no missing person report was filed regarding the disappearance of the accused’s parents. Bhopal’s Udyan Das confessed to killing his live-in partner and parents, police said. (HTPhoto) \n“Udyan, an only child, was living with his parents in Raipur. After killing his parents, he even managed to take out a death certificate in his father’s name. We are probing how he did that. Das’ mother has a sister, but she did not make any queries because they hadn’t been in touch for the last 18 years,” Gupta added. \nPolice sources said that Das’ father was a foreman with BHEL while his mother worked as a data analyst at Vindhyachal in Bhopal. They had three houses at Raipur, Delhi and Bhopal, and the combined rent of these properties came up to Rs 80,000 per month. Udyan’s mother also received a monthly pension of Rs 30,000, which would be deposited in a joint account of the Federal Bank, Bhopal. \nThe accused used to live on this money, police added. \nAkanksha’s murder came to light when a West Bengal Police team arrived at Bhopal in search of her. Her parents had lodged a missing complaint in December. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T23:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T13:34:56.809+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
