A source told Us Weekly that Maddie was strapped into her seat belt in the ATV when it overcorrected while trying to avoid a drainage ditch. After the ATV tipped over, Maddie was submerged under water and her mom and stepfather, Jamie Watson , were unable to get her out. The Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff's Office told Us on Monday, February 6, that Jamie Lynn and other family members attempted to rescue Maddie but to no avail, and that “ambulance services arrived within two minutes and freed her from the cold water.” You May Also Like", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T09:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:49:34.084+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
