He offered the advice in a speech to the Institute for Government in Whitehall yesterday,\nProfessor Seldon was careful to avoid saying how Theresa May rated on these 10 yardsticks, but in questions after his lecture he said he was concerned that modern prime ministers travelled too much. Although he himself had favoured remaining in the European Union , the professor said that one advantage of Brexit would be that the prime minister would not have to travel to so many EU summits. \n\nHe said that no prime minister should normally serve more than seven years and he revealed that David Cameron would have retired from Number 10 in 2018 if he had won the EU referendum last year. Most speculation had previously assumed Cameron would have stayed on until late 2019 before handing over in time for the next general election in 2020.\nProfessor Seldon’s ten top Dos and Don’ts for a successful premiership were:\nDo “secure the citadel” at Number 10 by forging strong bonds of trust from the start with the cabinet secretary in order to drive priorities Do find your authentic political voice and stick to it. If you don’t, the press will find it for you. Leaders are most persuasive when they speak from the heart not the head. Do focus on the big things. You will only be remembered one or two things, perhaps three at best. So be macro not micro. Do control your time. Be spare about chairing cabinet committees. Carve out time for reflection and rest. Go on, and stay on, holiday Do be totally clear from the outset with the cabinet. Tell them what you want. Sack them quickly if necessary. Find an enforcer in your cabinet to do the machine work. Do set a clear relationship with the media. Either they are the masters or you are. Be aloof. Be regal. Pick a fight with the media early on, and win it. Do behave with dignity and decorum. A prime minister is only one rung down from a head of state. You are a big figure. Display gravitas to gain respect. Never snap back. Do seize the big moments and command them. Set the tone for the key issues, debates and unexpected events. Aim to use a crisis to leave your footprint on history. Do be lean and simple in your leadership. Think longterm. Avoid the impulse to react to everything. Be sparing with reshuffles and relaunches. Do choose a chancellor of the exchequer whom you trust, and with whom you can work well. Don’t choose either a poodle or a tiger. And here are his ten tips on things for a prime minister to avoid:\n\nDon’t spend your time fiddling with trivial issues Don’t overwork Don’t have silly fights with colleagues, which diminish a premier’s authority Don’t be angry or bad tempered, as Anthony Eden, Gordon Brown and occasionally David Cameron were Don’t put the micro side of government before the macro Don’t blur or conceal the truth. If there is a bad test launch of a missile, be open. Don’t react. Be active and optimistic Don’t abandon the dignity of the office Don’t lose the backing of your cabinet Don’t drink too much or preferably at all Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.04am GMT 09:04 \nIt’s the full Brexit again today. MPs will resume their debate on the second reading of the article 50 bill, or the European Union (notification of withdrawal) bill, to give it its full title, and they will vote at 7pm. The bill is certain to be passed, but we will find out this evening how many Labour MPs are willing to defy Jeremy Corbyn and vote against it.\nHere is our live blog from yesterday covering what happened in the debate until it ended at midnight.\nBrexit: MPs debate article 50 bill - as it happened Read more \nBut, before that, we’ve got two interesting Brexit-related committees. Sir Ivan Rogers, who resigned as Britain’s ambassador to the EU last month with a parting email implicitly accusing Number 10 of “muddled thinking” on Brexit , will be speaking in public about this for the first time to the European scrutiny committee. And Liam Fox, the international development secretary, will give evidence to the first time to the committee set up to shadow his department.\nOh, and there is PMQs too.\nHere is the agenda for the day.\n10.05am: Sir Ivan Rogers, who resigned as Britain’s ambassador to the EU earlier than expected last month, gives evidence on EU-UK relations to the Commons European scrutiny committee.\n10.30am: Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, gives evidence to the international trade committee for the first time.\n12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs.\nAround 12.40pm: MPs resume the article 50 bill second reading debate.\n7pm: MPs vote on the article 50 bill. They will vote first on an SNP amendment opposing the bill, then on the bill itself, and then on the government’s programme motion.\nYou can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here. \nIf you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow. \nI try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all.
