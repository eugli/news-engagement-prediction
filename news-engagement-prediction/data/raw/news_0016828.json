Robyn Edie/Fairfax NZ \nDylan Kennett riding on his way to winning another title at the 2017 NZ Track National Cycling Championships in Invercargill. \nAccording to Walker it was an exciting experience to secure a team title. \n\"So cool, it's the first team event I have been part of since I left high school, to ride with someone and share that moment with someone else has been really cool,\" she said. John Hawkins/Fairfax NZ \nNZ cyclists Sam Webster and Ethan Mitchell warming down after riding in the men's team sprint for Auckland at the NZ Track Cycling Championships in Invercargill. \n\"My first practice was in qualifying and this was my second time, definitely better than the first race we got better from that one into the second one.\" \nEverything went right for the untried combination of Walker and former Southland rower Young who were the top qualifiers for the final. \n\"I nailed it, I feel we had really good timing out of the start and I went as hard as I could for the lap and I felt I got Tess in the position to just come flying through and she motored it home and we got a really good time,\" Walker said. \n\"We were very close in qualifying, there was almost nothing in it, it was always going to be an interesting final, Jaime and Racquel, even though they are enduro riders and part of the team pursuit that were in Rio.\" Ad Feedback \nWalker's preparation had been helped by former NZ sprint team representative Katie Schofield. \n\"I would have had no idea how to train if I didn't get help, I went and found Katie, she was in the NZ team for the team sprint last year and the year before and she has had so much experience,\" Walker said. \nThe Waikato-BOP rider now returns to the BMX to focus on the World Cups and World Championships and has been benefited from two months of training in the track cycling discipline. \nShe will return to track cycling in Auckland as she tries to keep improving and make it into the New Zealand team for the Oceania Championships. \n\"At the end of the day, I may not be good enough to make the team sprint, but I will try, there won't be any regrets or what ifs. I would rather try and fail than not try at all,\" she said. \nAuckland men's sprint team of NZ riders Sam Webster, Ethan Mitchell and Zac Williams claimed the gold medal after Waikato-BOP were relegated to silver after two false starts. \nThe trio broke a NZ championships record of 43.900s during qualifying, making the most of hot track conditions. \nFormer South Canterbury rider Dylan Kennett had an impressive meet and claimed the madison title with Campbell Stewart to add to his 4000m individual pursuit, 30km points race and men's 15km scratch race victories. \nSheath and Michaela Drummond won the women's madison. \nIn other results, the Southland team of Tom Sexton, Josh Haggerty, Nick Kergozou and Anton O'Connell won the men's team pursuit by 2.177 seconds over Canterbury with a time of 4:07.029. \nIn the women's pursuit, the Waikato-BOP women's combination of Sheath, Rushlee Buchanan, Nielsen and Bryony Botha won the team's pursuit when they caught their WCNI opponents. \nSophie-Leigh Bloxham and Emily Shearman WCNI won the women's U19 team sprint against Waikato-BOP's Sammi Ogle and Ellesse Andrews. \nThe Southland U19 men's team of Mitchell Morris, Samuel Miler and Corbin Strong won the 750m sprint team final over Auckland. \nOverall, Waikato-BOP lead with 50 points from Southland's 49, heading into the Age Group National Championships. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T14:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T09:55:55.864+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
