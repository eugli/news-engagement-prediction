Kennington’s momentous bid to qualify for his first Daytona 500 will come down to one last race Nick Faris 02.19.2017 D.J. Kennington sits in his car during practice for the 59th Daytona 500 on Feb. 18. D.J. Kennington drives during practice for the Daytona 500 on Feb. 18.   \nD.J. Kennington’s historic chance to compete in the Daytona 500 will come down to one final run on Thursday night. \nKennington, a two-time champion of NASCAR’s Canadian series, fell 0.445 seconds short in his first attempt to qualify for the sport’s most prestigious race in a Sunday time trial. He placed fourth among the field’s six “non-Charter” drivers, his competition for the last of 40 spots in the main starting grid. \nBrendan Gaughan and Elliott Sadler were the fastest non-Charter drivers in the time trial and qualified directly for the main race, set for next Sunday afternoon at Daytona International Speedway. \nKennington, meanwhile, gets a second and final opportunity. He’ll vie for one of two remaining spots on Thursday in the Can-Am Duel, a pair of 150-mile heats that determines starting order for the rest of the drivers. \nReed Sorenson, a 31-year-old part-timer in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, finished one spot ahead of Kennington in the time trial among the drivers who have yet to qualify; Corey LaJoie, 25, and 23-year-old Timmy Hill are the others. Kennington will be tasked with finishing ahead of two of them in the Duel. \nKennington, a 39-year-old native of St. Thomas, Ont., is a relative newcomer to NASCAR’s top tier. His only career start in the Cup Series came in November, when he placed 35th in a 40-man field at the Can-Am 500 in Phoenix. (Sorenson was 36th, while LaJoie and Hill didn’t race.) \nInstead, Kennington has starred for years on stock car racing’s top Canadian circuit, known since 2007 as the Pinty’s Series; he boasts 26 career wins and has appeared in 204 consecutive races. He has also raced a combined 55 times in the Xfinity Series and the Camping World Truck Series, the equivalent of NASCAR’s minor leagues. \nNo Canadian has driven in the Daytona 500 since 1988, when Calgary’s Trevor Boys qualified for the fifth time in his career and finished 19th. Patrick Carpentier, a decorated open-wheel racer from Montreal, missed out on his lone bid to qualify in 2008.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T05:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T00:29:22.949+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
