The group included three players to sign at FBS schools in linebacker Daniel Green (Kansas State), receiver Isaia Mullen (Hawaii) and cornerback Wyryor Noil (Idaho). \nThe rebound came during the spring of 2015, when Madison hired Don Johnson as its head coach. Johnson gave the program the shot of emotional adrenaline it needed, and in particular addressed the academic side of the ledger, where several players were flailing in the classroom. \n“He’s tough as I don’t know what about academics. He always makes sure that we are students before we’re athletes,” Mullen said. \nJohnson proudly talks about how Green made a big jump onto the recruiting scene not because of his athletic skills, but when he began buckling down in the classroom and improving his grades by nearly a full point. Johnson beams as he pulls out his cell phone and shows one of Noil’s social media pages, where he often posts things like his report card. \nNoil was a sophomore at Grant when he decided to transfer back to Madison, his neighborhood school, upon Johnson’s arrival. \n“I decided once I got around him, and I liked his coaching style. It was more of a family here,” Noil said. \nGreen, one of the state’s recruiting standouts among this senior class, went to the 11 th hour before landing on Kansas State. Green made his decision late Wednesday morning, choosing the Wildcats over offers from Utah and Mississippi. \nEarlier in the fall, Green rescinded a verbal commitment to USC. Kansas State over the Trojans? That doesn’t happen often. \n“I just wanted to open my options back up. I was getting a lot of interest from different schools, and I wanted to see what other schools had to offer,” Green said. \nIn the end, Kansas State and its fatherly coach Bill Snyder won over Green. \n“He was one of the reasons I committed. It would be an honor for me to play for a legendary coach like that,” Green said. “It felt like a perfect fit. I connected with the people and the players, and thought that’s the place for me.” \nFour Senator seniors signed with College of the Redwoods in Diovonne Green, Noa Kindred, Jaiden O’Neal and Kwame Assuman. Tyree O’Neil is headed for Arizona Western, Marcus Sampson-Cha to Western Oregon and Fabion Wilson to George Fox. Abdi Hassan is still deciding between George Fox and Lewis & Clark. Anthony Iongi accepted a preferred walk-on offer from Utah State.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T08:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T08:14:25.655+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
