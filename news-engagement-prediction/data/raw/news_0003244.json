I share a good number of them myself. But when the British Government is rightly trying to court this combustible man — who this week reportedly hung up during a fraught phone conversation with the Australian Prime Minister — it is not sensible for the Prince to rile him by airing such reservations in public. A few days ago, Charles mounted what looked like a coded attack on Trump’s controversial immigration policy. He spoke of the need to help communities in trouble. The Prince warned that ‘the horrific lessons of the war seem to be in increasing danger of being forgotten’ — widely interpreted as a reference to Hitler. It was no coincidence that he was speaking at a fund-raiser for World Jewish Relief, a doubtless admirable charity which was set up in 1933 to support those escaping Nazi persecution, and which is now working with those fleeing Syria and seeking new lives in Europe. I suppose it’s just possible he wasn’t intentionally having a dig at Trump’s executive order suspending entry for people from seven Muslim countries into the United States, but the timing of his poorly-judged remarks could not have been more ill-chosen if he had tried. It was extremely foolish of the Prince to talk in such terms and awaken memories of the Nazis. And that’s without putting it in the context of a previous unabashed diatribe — seemingly against Trump and Britain’s Brexiteers — on Radio 4’s Thought For The Day slot two days before Christmas. On that occasion, Charles spoke of the plight of refugees, quoting United Nations figures which suggest that in 2015 a ‘staggering’ 65.3 million people had ‘abandoned their homes’. In what seemed a critical reference to Trump’s plans for America, he added: ‘Their suffering doesn’t end when they arrive seeking refuge in a foreign land.’ He also mentioned ‘the rise of many populist groups’, which may have been a furtive dig at those who were rash enough to vote for Brexit. Surely, the sophisticated Prince realises that the word ‘populist’ has become a nasty slur used in Leftist circles to deride the views of the majority of decent people. There can be little doubt that he was also getting at Donald Trump by referring to ‘many populist groups’ who, Charles said, are increasingly aggressive to those who adhere to a minority faith — an apparent allusion to Islam. He claimed to have been reminded of ‘the dark days of the Thirties’ — another reference to the Nazis. Wasn’t this veiled lunge at Trump way over the top? In fact — not to beat about the bush — verging on the lunatic? Whatever one thinks of the new U.S. President, it is surely incontestable that at the very moment Theresa May seems to have found an indispensable ally in him for a post-Brexit world, our next Head of State should not be going out of his way to insult him. There is, alas, a possible looming clash between the two men which may eclipse previous differences. I am speaking about climate change, on which subject the President and the Prince hold diametrically opposing views. It doesn’t really matter whether or not one is in sympathy with Trump’s scepticism about man-made climate change. My own suspicion is that he underestimates the dangers. He undoubtedly sometimes talks a good deal of rubbish. In one of his madder Tweets, Trump suggested last November that ‘the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.’ Trump has appointed several climate-change sceptics to his Cabinet, including energy secretary Rick Perry, who declared in 2011 that global warming was an unproven scientific theory. The new President’s views on the subject are almost certainly not fully considered. But it would still be madness — and potentially highly damaging to Anglo-American relations — to let Charles loose on him. For Charles is a zealot on this subject. In fact, I would go so far as to say he is rather unbalanced on climate change. In December 2009, he flew to Copenhagen to attend a climate change summit, where he warned the audience that ‘the world has only seven years before we lose the levers of control’. The Prince, by the way, was able to overcome his scruples, so that instead of taking a boat or train to Copenhagen, he commandeered a jet belonging to the Queen’s Flight, generating an estimated 6.4 tons of carbon dioxide (which is believed to contribute to global warming) — 5.2 tons more than if he had used a commercial flight. But then, he is a man who, while proselytising the virtues of austerity for others, has always continued to live in a plutocratic way. Pampered and privileged as he is, I don’t suppose he has the faintest idea of the extent to which ‘green levies’ (imposed by governments on sources of pollution or carbon emissions) increase the energy bills of ordinary, hard-pressed people. Since delivering his apocalyptic warning in Copenhagen, Charles has declared that mankind was ‘committing suicide on a grand scale’ if urgent action was not taken on green issues. In 2015, he also eccentrically suggested that one of the ‘main reasons’ for the war in Syria was a drought attributable to climate change. We have now passed the Prince’s seven-year Doomsday deadline, yet, somehow, life goes on. Charles himself seems to have decided there may still be time to avoid Armageddon after all. Don’t we have the ingredients here for a most undiplomatic, titanic clash of egos? Members of Trump’s administration have reportedly privately warned that the President has no desire to be lectured by Charles when he pays an official State visit to Britain later this year. But in view of his strong opinions, and his eagerness to communicate them at every opportunity, it seems unlikely that the impassioned Prince will heed this admonition. There must be a strong possibility that he will upset the President at the very time the British Government is trying to woo him. In an ideal world, the Queen would despatch the Prince on a lengthy round-the-world cruise during Trump’s visit. Yet I doubt that a man who believes he has the right to bombard ministers with his ‘black spider memos’ would be so easily fobbed off and give up what he must regard as the opportunity of a lifetime to badger Trump with his views. It seems to me scarcely credible that we should be contemplating the prospect of Charles — who is supposed to have no political role — interfering in a way that might damage a delicately wrought trans-atlantic relationship. I am afraid he is in danger of straying far outside his proper constitutional duties. Let me say that in many ways I admire him greatly. No one could doubt that he fervently wants the world to be a better place. The Prince’s Trust, which he set up in 1976, has done an enormous amount of good for many thousands of disadvantaged children. There is something engaging about his inquiring and original mind, even if he sometimes topples over into barminess. And though I’m concerned that he may rub up President Trump the wrong way, I am even more worried about the damage he may do to the monarchy. It has many dormant enemies, however popular the Queen may be. There is a particularly moving scene in the TV series The Crown, produced by Netflix. The young Queen Elizabeth is given a lesson about her exalted position by her grandmother, Queen Mary, widow of George V. Elizabeth says it doesn’t ‘feel right as head of state to say and do nothing’. Queen Mary replies: ‘It is exactly right. To do nothing is the hardest job of all. It will take all your energy. ‘To be impartial is not natural, not human. People always want you to smile, agree or frown, but the minute you do, you will have declared a position — a point of view. That is the one thing as sovereign you are not entitled to do.’ It is a hard lesson for any intelligent person to learn, but Queen Elizabeth adopted it at any early age. It has been an act of extraordinary sacrifice to hold her peace while all around her are giving vent to their opinions — to watch speechlessly, in the public sphere, as the world around her changed. At the age of 68, Prince Charles still thinks he has the right to speak his mind. In fact, he is growing more forthright. I’m afraid he does not — when it comes to keeping his mouth shut — begin to understand what sacrifice entails. I don’t know who can save the Prince from himself. His mother? Father? Wife? It is very late in the day. The truth is that he is a gifted man. But he is also a self-indulgent one with a diminishing sense of danger. At the eleventh hour, the Prince of Wales could still follow the noble example of his mother, and unite rather than divide the country. But I fear that he has no intention of doing so — which is why I really do tremble for the future of our great monarchy.
