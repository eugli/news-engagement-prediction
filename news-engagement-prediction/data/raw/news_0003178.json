AP:Associated Press Donald Trump may finally be getting tough with Vladimir Putin AP:Associated Press The US said it would not drop sanctions on Putin’s Russia until it returns Crimea Reuters 8 US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley slammed Russia’s ‘aggressive actions’ \nHaley said measures imposed in 2014 after Russia annexed Crimea would remain in place “until Russia returns control over the peninsula to Ukraine “. \nMany in Ukraine had feared that Trump’s seemingly soft stance on Russia would lead to Putin becoming more aggressive as American support ebbed away. \nBut the ambassador blasted Russia’s “aggressive actions” in the country and promised strong US support to Kiev. \nIn her first public remarks at the UN Security Council, Haley said: “We do want to better our relations with Russia. \n“However, the dire situation in eastern Ukraine is one that demands clear and strong condemnation of Russian actions.” \nA surge in fighting in the country’s troubled east has presented President Trump with an early test of his policy on Russia.
