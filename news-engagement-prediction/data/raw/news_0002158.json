In addition to police stations, hospitals or trains, that money could be used to build 225 new primary schools or 105 new secondary schools, the paper argues. \n“Cost premiums from union EBAs are adding up to 30 per cent to construction costs, including for critical infrastructure projects like roads, schools, hospitals and police stations,” Mr Rozner said. \n“This is particularly problematic for government projects. Governments are less price sensitive than private enterprise because they are able to pay for these higher wage bills out of consolidated revenue — typically by raising taxes or incurring larger deficits. Victorian taxpayers deserve value for money. \n“Victoria cannot afford to pay a cent more than necessary for these projects at a time when the state is critically short of infrastructure.” \nIn November, legislation resurrecting the building industry watchdog, the Australian Building and Construction Commission, passed the Senate , but included a two-year transition period before the new Australian Building Code for government-funded projects applies. \nIn 2014, the newly elected Victorian Andrews Government abolished a similar Victorian Building Code that applied to Victorian Government-backed projects. \n“Victorians are paying the price because Daniel Andrews is a divisive Premier more interested in sweetheart deals for his mates than the state’s livability,” a spokesman for the Victorian opposition said. \nMr Rozner said while the reintroduction of the ABCC by the Turnbull Government was a “worthy first step”, the Andrews Government needed to act to reduce costs in the construction industry. \n“Its decision to abolish the Victorian Construction Code was shortsighted and it should be reinstated,” he said. “The Victorian Government needs to read the writing on the wall, adopt the principles of the new Australian Code and allow some of these important projects to be built at a more affordable cost.” \nA spokesman for the CFMEU said: “This self-serving and misleading propaganda, written by a former Liberal staffer on behalf of the Liberal Party’s own think tank, isn’t worthy of a serious response from a union that is actually focused on keeping construction workers safe while they’re busy building this city.” \nA spokesman for the Victorian government said: “The IPA and Turnbull Government have failed to prove any link between their politically motivated code and running a successful economy. \n“The Victorian economy is the most successful in Australia and we are proud of the thousands of jobs being generated building Metro Tunnel, removing level crossings and our other major transport projects. \n“The wages and conditions of Victorian construction workers are a matter between the employers and the employees.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T08:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T09:54:41.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
