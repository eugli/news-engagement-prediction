Dickey were signed to one-year deals in November.\nGarcia is on Mexico’s WBC roster, but there’s still a chance he might drop out and concentrate solely on spring training with his new team.\n“I love my country, I’ve always wanted to represent them, but my priority is the Atlanta Braves,” he said. “With how much they invested in me and they believe in me, that’s what I’m focusing on, on being ready in April…. (Pitching in the WBC) is still up in the air. Right now we’re trying to make the best decision for everybody. Not just for myself and my future, but for the Atlanta Braves. That’s my priority right now.”\nGarcia, 30, is entering his final season before free agency and posted a 4.67 ERA in 171 2/3 innings over 30 starts in 2016 for the Cardinals, the first time since 2011 that he made more than 20 starts or pitched as many as 130 innings.\nHe discussed the WBC possibility with his agent and the Braves after the Dec. 1 trade.\n“My goal here is to prepare for April and hopefully to pitch through October,” he said. “That’s my goal and that’s what I’m preparing for. I’ve been around for quite some time and I know what I need to do. The WBC didn’t change my preparation one bit, at all. Doesn’t change my spring training philosophy. I’m going to try to do well, but every time I take the mound, whether it’s a bullpen or a live BP, or a spring training game, or a World Series game – I’ve been on that stage – it’s always been the same intensity. I don’t try to throw harder, I don’t try to do anything different.\n“Any time I take the mound I don’t take anything for granted, but it definitely didn’t change my approach in getting ready for the season.”\nGarcia had no idea he might get traded until the deal went down. While he was surprised, he was not disappointed by the outcome. He grew up a Braves fan and had noticed the November moves made by the club, signing Colon, Dickey and versatile veteran Sean Rodriguez.\n“I saw those (November) signings, and I just thought last year when I played against (the Braves) and the end of the year, watching the lineup and the defense and the excitement – I had a good feeling about this ballclub, playing against them,” he said. “Then I saw the way they were going about it, with the signings, like Sean Rodriguez and those two (starters), and a lot of the talent they had on defense and in the bullpen….\n“I was keeping up with that, and when the trade happened I was very excited. If I were to pick a team, if they asked me where you wanted to get traded, Atlanta would have definitely been at the top of the list.”\nHis early experiences with teammates, manager Brian Snitker has only strengthened those feelings.\n“The positiveness — great attitude – and how guys love (Snitker) around here and respect him, that’s the main thing,” he said. “I’m extremely excited to be a part of this. Always been a huge fan of the Atlanta Braves, that’s one of my favorite teams growing up. I love the history of the team, I love how they go about it, and I’m extremely excited to be a part of it.”\nAnd new Braves pitching coach Chuck Hernandez?\n“Talking with people who worked with him in the past, I’ve heard nothing but great things,” Garcia said. “My agent, he played with him, and he played in the big leagues for a long time. The very first thing he said when the trade happened, he’s like, if I were to go back in the big leagues and play for someone, or have my son play for someone, it would be Chuck Hernandez. He loves the guy, and I’ve heard nothing but great things about the guy. He’s been around for a long time. Guys like him, and he’s very knowledgeable and has experience. What else can you ask for in a pitching coach?”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T01:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:46:34.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
