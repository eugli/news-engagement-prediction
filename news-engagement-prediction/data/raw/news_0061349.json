Fabulous! Don't forget to share with your friends on Twitter and Facebook. 16 Honest, Moving, And Personal Stories About “Hidden” Homelessness Street homelessness is just the tip of the iceberg. Many more people are surfing friends’ sofas or squatting in makeshift homes. Hilary Mitchell BuzzFeed Staff 1. We asked members of the BuzzFeed Community to tell us about their experiences of “hidden” homelessness (sleeping in cars, on friends’ sofas, or in temporary accommodation rather than on the streets). Here are some of their stories. ID: 10568083 – Submitted by ellec4b44f9321 ID: 10568086 2. “I’ve been homeless on and off for almost four years now. I have lots of supportive family and friends, but it’s hard on them to have me around all the time. In summers I sleep in my van in the countryside, showering in lakes and cooking on a camp stove. The worst part isn’t living out of a suitcase, it’s the looks I get from co-workers or friends when I tell them I’m technically homeless.” \n– Submitted by hatesusernames ID: 10568233 3. “I’m 19 and I live at a homeless shelter. I’m working really hard to get my life back on track but it’s a lot harder than you’d think. I have a job and I’m a hard worker. I’ve only told two of my friends because it’s embarrassing. I still dress nice and keep up my appearance because I don’t want anyone to realise what I’m going through. People look at me differently when I come out of the shelter than when I walk out of work. I’m the same person in both places though.” – Submitted by flyyoufools ID: 10568093 5. “When I was 19 and in my first year of university, I became irreconcilably estranged from my family and had to travel the country to stay on friends’ settees. I even volunteered at a festival just so I had somewhere to camp and be fed for a weekend. It was incredibly difficult and it was so hard to break free of it. To get any support or employment you need an address, and I was moving every couple of days. People didn’t really understand, as when you mention homelessness you immediately think of being on the streets, and I wasn’t (although I always had a single duvet with me, just in case).” \n– Submitted by jessmay93 ID: 10568104 6. “My mum phoned me up on my last day of college and told me I wasn’t welcome back and that she’d changed the locks. I was 18 and the fact I’d just finished my course meant she no longer got child benefit for me. For a good few months I was sofa surfing and spending some nights outside. During the day my amazing ex would let me stay in his house while he was at college – I could have a bath and his mum would feed me. I had no help off the council whatsoever. Luckily for me, my old foster parents found out and took me back in just before the winter, which was so bad that a local lad passed out in the snow and died.” – Submitted by taylarh2 ID: 10568111 8. “I worked for a housing charity for several months before I turned 20. It was there I discovered the difference between homelessness and rooflessness. We housed vulnerable young people, many of whom had been kicked out. I will never forget one young girl’s story of sheltering in her mum’s yard because she refused to let her in because she’d been outed as gay by a family ‘friend’. The charity has since closed and I can’t stop thinking about all those young people.” – Submitted by newu1994 ID: 10568137 9. “My mum found out that my sister’s friends were couch surfing and missing college, so they now live with us. We also have two homeless lads living with us at the moment. Their parents lost their homes, and because they’re over 16 they’re not eligible to be housed with their family. It’s awful that so many young people are homeless and having to couch surf and walk miles to find a place to sleep at night, and that colleges aren’t picking up on students’ problems and offering help.” \n– Submitted by panthuras ID: 10568278 10. “I was homeless for nine months, living with my 6-year-old autistic son in a cheap local hotel after my landlord sold up without any prior warning. I received no help from the local authorities, and I wasn’t able to save my wage quickly enough to rent somewhere privately. Thankfully I was eventually referred to a tenancy support agent who managed to get us both a council property. \n“A year on from hitting that low point my son and I are finally able to start making this house our home and we now are in a position to offer out our spare room to other people in a similar position. That being said, my son still comes home from school with that heartbreaking question, ‘Have we still got our house?’” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T15:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T10:35:57.158+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
