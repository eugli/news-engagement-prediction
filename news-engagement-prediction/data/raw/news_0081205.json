She has also reportedly left Delhi for now.  \nIn a candid admission of the pressure she has faced since she started her campaign, she said that she had reached the limit her \"20-year-self could take\".\n\nI have been through a lot and this is all my 20 year self could take :)\n— Gurmehar Kaur (@mehartweets) February 28, 2017 \nThe Kargil martyr's daughter had been reportedly receiving threats of sexual violence after she posted a picture on Facebook protesting against ABVP after last week's clashes between the former and the All India Students Association at the Ramjas College. \"I request to be left alone. I said what I had to say,\" the 20-year-old Lady Shri Ram College student wrote on Twitter.  \nBullied and harried \nAfter her campaign went viral, she reportedly received a plethora of threats, including those involving sexual violence. It seems that the threats did their intended job. Gurmehar tweeted, \"It's a request, please leave me alone. Stop spamming my wall and phone. Any question about my decision tweet to @Voice_Of_Ram.\" \n\nI'm withdrawing from the campaign. Congratulations everyone. I request to be left alone. I said what I had to say.. (1/2)\n— Gurmehar Kaur (@mehartweets) February 28, 2017 \nThe campaign is about students and not about me. Please go to the March in huge numbers. Best of luck.\n— Gurmehar Kaur (@mehartweets) February 28, 2017 \nTo anyone questioning my courage and bravery.. I've shown more than enough\n— Gurmehar Kaur (@mehartweets) February 28, 2017 \nIt's a request, please leave me alone. Stop spamming my wall and phone. Any question abt my decision tweet to @Voice_Of_Ram \n— Gurmehar Kaur (@mehartweets) February 28, 2017 \nOne thing is for sure, next time we will think twice before resorting to violence or threats and that's all this was about (2/2)\n— Gurmehar Kaur (@mehartweets) February 28, 2017 \nThe twitter handle in the above tweet belongs to Ram Subramanian, who is reportedly Kaur's adviser. Subramanian tweeted from his handle that Kaur was \"scared\" and that she was \"leaving Delhi for now.\"\n\nJust spoke to @mehartweets she is really scared. She's leaving delhi for now. It's sad we have become this country. Really really sad.\n— Ram Subramanian (@Voice_Of_Ram) February 28, 2017 \n\"To anyone questioning my courage and bravery, I've shown more than enough,\" she said in another tweet. The most poignant tweet was the following: \"I have been through a lot and this is all my 20-year-self could take.\" \nIt wasn't just random people on social media who trolled her for her stand. Celebrities and political leaders took shots at her too.  \nOn Monday, her campaign drew controversial reactions from Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders, with Union minister Kiren Rijiju wondering who was \"polluting\" her mind and another comparing her with wanted gangster Dawood Ibrahim.\n\nWho's polluting this young girl's mind? A strong Arm Force prevents a war. India never attacked anyone but a weak India was always invaded. https://t.co/gXHkAGi9sh \n— Kiren Rijiju (@KirenRijiju) February 27, 2017 \nSome people say they need Freedom in India. Listen to those people taking shelter in India after facing torture in neighbouring countries. https://t.co/MDoGYDF1Si \n— Kiren Rijiju (@KirenRijiju) February 27, 2017 \nFreedom of expression is not a licence to shout anti- national slogans in campuses. Criticise the govt but don't abuse the motherland. https://t.co/3iqyqeLdJe \n— Kiren Rijiju (@KirenRijiju) February 27, 2017 \nEveryone has right of views but she said Pakistan didn't kill our brave martyr & India should shun war. India never perpetrated violence! https://t.co/2b8SHLdPRg \n— Kiren Rijiju (@KirenRijiju) February 27, 2017 \nPratap Simha, BJP MP from Mysuru, tweeted, \"At least Dawood did not use the crutches of his father's name to justify his anti- national stand.\" His tweet came in response to another of Kaur's photographs, in which she said, \"Pakistan did not kill my father. War killed him.\"\n\npic.twitter.com/NaG4xVrT2B \n— Pratap Simha (@mepratap) February 26, 2017 \nOne more for controversy mongering media: via fb pic.twitter.com/oToxv1exqe \n— Pratap Simha (@mepratap) February 27, 2017 \nYou need 2 nations for a war. India cannot wage war against itself. Then which is other nation that killed your dad, if not Pakistan?! pic.twitter.com/iQ1Q7R7HQo \n— Pratap Simha (@mepratap) February 27, 2017 \nTo mock her, Simha also posted a photograph showing Dawood with the message, \"I didn't kill people in 1993. Bombs killed them.\"  \nRijiju also took to Twitter to take a dig at her. \"Who's polluting this young girl's mind? Strong armed forces prevent a war. India never attacked anyone but a weak India was always invaded,\" the minister of state for home affairs said.  \nShe still believes she was right \n\"One thing is for sure, next time we will think twice before resorting to violence or threats and that's all this was about,\" she said in her last tweet.  \nThrough most of her campaign, Kaur appears to have conducted herself with poise. Even as she bowed out, she had this to say: \"The campaign is about students and not about me. Please go to the March in huge numbers. Best of luck.\" \nBS Web Team | Agencies  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T09:09:39.447+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
