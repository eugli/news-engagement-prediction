And yet, the application couldn’t be more apt. \nOn the heels of a growing list of retailers that have chosen to drop the Ivanka Trump fashion and accessories brand from their product offering, a new movement is brewing to keep the label alive. Supporters of the first daughter have taken to Twitter to encourage people to #buyIvanka while simultaneously saying #byeNordstrom. \nWATCH: Ivanka Trump is a big fan of Trudeau Story continues below \nLast week, the movement was given a face when five women in Chandler, Arizona, recorded themselves going to Nordstrom to close their accounts in response to the department store’s decision to stop carrying the Ivanka Trump brand . \nIn a video posted to her Facebook page with the caption, “Dumped # Nordstrom today for Dumping Ivanka! This is how it went down… # byenordstrom # buyivanka ,” Laurie Ray and four of her friends can be seen marching through a local outpost of the department store chanting, “no money for Nordstrom’s.” \nTwo women in the group wore matching t-shirts with a picture of President Donald Trump and a caption that read “Haters Gonna Hate,” and each took a turn explaining her decision to the camera. \nWaving a fistful of cash in the air, one woman chastises the store “because they caved,” while another declares “we’re going to shop where Ivanka shops.” The women also say that they are headed to Dillard’s “to buy all kinds of stuff,” presumably because the chain carries the Ivanka brand. \nREAD MORE: Is Ivanka Trump a model of modern feminism? \nThe video has received more than three million views and over 31,000 shares since it was posted six days ago. \nJeannie Petersen Guthrie, a member of the group of ex-Nordstrom shoppers, commented on the popularity of the video on Facebook, expressing surprise that it went viral. \n“We had no intent of ever entertaining anyone other than our few fb [ sic ] friends/family and enjoying a good time together as girlfriends. I am thrilled to find that we were not alone in this cause and that thousands and thousands and thousands of others were doing the exact same thing as us.” \nThere is no documentation indicating that “thousands” have closed their accounts at Nordstrom. \nRay’s video has garnered the women attention from a number of media outlets, including Fox News, and has given a face to the lesser heard — though nonetheless growing — cry of support for Ivanka’s label. (Between the video and the commenters on the Ivanka Trump HQ Facebook page, the face of this movement, like the 53 per cent of women who voted for Trump, appears to be largely white.) \nSince Nordstrom announced its decision to drop the line, the hashtag #buyIvanka has begun to proliferate on Twitter.
