The new cannabis beverage company partnered with Ritual Coffee \"to bring you (damn good) single-origin coffee, infused with pure California grown flower.\" While Somatik promises each bottle has \"just the right dose of cannabis and caffeine for a mild euphoric effect and balanced experience,\" it does clearly state on the bottle that it contains 15 mg THC. According to High Times ' \"10 Commandments of Marijuana Edible Safety,\" \"Eating 10â€“25 milligrams of THC will make your muscles relax, and waves of bliss will blanket your body. Giggling and silliness are common. You will feel relaxed and cozy . . . The high can last from four to six hours, or longer with higher doses.\" \nWhile those clearly versed in edibles may know their tolerance, if you're new to consuming cannabis, High Times recommends \"start[ing] with a low dose of 10 milligrams of THC and wait[ing] two hours before consuming any more cannabis.\" That would be approximately 2/3 of the bottle. Somatik says you can expect the beverage to taste \"light-bodied and smooth with subtle notes of cherry, a hint of herbaceous flavor, and undertones of bright lemon.\" Sounds like a pretty brilliant way to wake up. SF Weekly says you can find Somatik at Harvest in San Francisco, Magnolia Wellness in Oakland, or online at Cannvis .
