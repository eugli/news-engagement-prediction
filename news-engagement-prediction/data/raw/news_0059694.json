(Michael Dresser/Baltimore Sun video) \nAt the Board of Public Works meeting, Gov. Larry Hogan took a shot at Democratic General Assembly leaders, prodding the House to schedule a hearing on one of his bills that would require the legislature to stream live video of its floor sessions. (Michael Dresser/Baltimore Sun video) Michael Dresser took a shot at Democratic General Assembly leaders Wednesday, prodding the House to schedule a hearing on one of his bills while tweaking Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller for using colorful language.\nLeading off a meeting of the Board of Public Works, the Republican governor criticized House of Delegates leaders for being slow to schedule a hearing on legislation that would require the legislature to stream live video of its floor sessions. \nDel. Shane Pendergrass, who chairs the House committee that will hear the bill, said it had been scheduled for a hearing just this morning. However, the hearing date had not yet been added to the General Assembly's website. \nThe lack of a set date gave the governor an opportunity to put public pressure on lawmakers to consider what he calls his Legislative Transparency Act of 2017. \n\"In spite of overwhelming bipartisan support for this legislation, the bill hasn't even been scheduled for a hearing in the House of Delegates,\" Hogan said. \nThe governor went on to tease Miller over his recent use of profane language from the Senate podium. Miller was expressing frustration over delays passing a bill that would set up a safety commission to monitor Washington's Metrorail system. The delay caused the state to miss a deadline that prompted the federal government to withhold transit funding.
