Senators expected to vote for inquiry into alleged breaches of Roe highway conditions Read more \nA response from Frydenberg’s office to the Senate said “neither the minister nor the department has received correspondence or reports with evidence of compliance breaches with approval conditions since construction commenced”. \nBut on Wednesday night protesters and environmentalists forwarded to Guardian Australia dozens of emails that had been sent to Frydenberg and his office over the past few weeks highlighting alleged breaches of environmental conditions. \nThe alleged breaches included that traps to capture the endangered southern brown so the animals could be relocated were not being set according to requirements. It is required that the traps be set for between three and four days, and that trapping continue until there have been at least two consecutive nights of no bandicoots being caught. \nCommunity members monitoring the wetlands around the clock say they saw bandicoots being caught and removed from the Coolbellup bushland site just two hours before clearing began. Several similar instances were recorded between 13 January and 5 February, including in one of the most ecologically sensitive areas of the wetlands. \nAllegations have also been made to the minister that asbestos and dust management plans are not being adhered to; that a survey of potential nesting hollows of Western Australia’s endangered black cockatoos was not completed; and that fencing to protect animals from injuries and death during the bulldozing was not being installed properly. \nFrydenberg’s office was yet to respond to a request from Guardian Australia for comment. \nOn Thursday the Senate was due to vote on a motion put forward by Greens Senator Scott Ludlam calling for a snap inquiry into the alleged breaches , including claims endangered animals were being trapped and relocated in a manner that breached regulations. \nBut the WA environment minister, Albert Jacob, dismissed the claims as “completely unfounded”. \n“The Roe highway extension is being constructed in accordance with the approved conditions and management plans,” Jacob said. \n“Before clearing started, trees were inspected in accordance with the fauna management plan for the presence of active nesting or breeding by black cockatoos. No active nesting was found. \n“Likewise, before clearing each site, a fauna trapping and translocation program has been undertaken in line with the fauna management plan, which requires that no bandicoots are trapped for two consecutive nights or as determined by a fauna expert.” 'It's not too late': Beeliar wetlands activists fight on as bulldozers roll in Read more \nHe said the Office of the Environmental Protection Authority had independent auditors on site daily to monitor compliance with conditions. \n“All allegations have been examined and there have been no incidences of non-compliance to date,” Jacob said. “The Roe highway extension is the most scrutinised project in recent history. Not only has the project undergone rigorous environmental assessments at both the state and commonwealth levels, it has withstood several court challenges. \n“I have confidence in the robustness and legality of the project’s environmental impact assessment and ongoing management and compliance with the ministerial conditions.” \nLudlam has called on Frydenberg to intervene and order that bulldozing stop until an investigation had been carried out.
