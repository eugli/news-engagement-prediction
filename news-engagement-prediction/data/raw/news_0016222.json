(Photo: Gary Malerba, Special to the Free Press) \nLights, camera, War Memorial. \nThe Grosse Pointe Farms institution is partnering with Emagine Entertainment to create a movie theater in its theater space. The Patriot Cinema will show first-run blockbusters along with art and specialty films and live broadcasts of sports and cultural events. \nThe stage will remain in place for live events. Reclining seats and a retractable movie screen will be installed. \nIt's scheduled to open in December. \nSome of the proceeds will go to the War Memorial's Patriot Initiative, which supports organizations that provides services to groups like veterans and police officers. \n\"It works in a franchising system, where we pay them to use their equipment and have their concessions and have access to all of their media, because theyâ€™re able to contract with movie studios and producers of films to get more rights than we would,\" said War Memorial spokesman Brooks Hoste. \nA community survey identified a film theater of this sort as a need. \nTicket pricing hasn't been announced yet, but Hoste said it will be comparable to other cinemas. \nAccording to the website, the Patriot Cinema will be open Tuesday through Sunday with shows in the morning, afternoon and evening, though not running past 11 p.m. \nEmagine CEO Paul Glantz explained that they have expertise in theater design components, like acoustics, sight lines and seating configurations. \nHe said the programming will be trial and error but the fare will be upscale: \"It would exclude things like horror films. We probably wouldn't play 'The Ring.' What we would play is 'Hidden Figures' or 'The Founder,' pictures that have great story lines.\" \nThe War Memorial is a 1910 Italian Renaissance-style mansion built for Russel Alger Jr., who helped move the Packard Motor Car Co. to Detroit and the son of the former Michigan governor, U.S. secretary of war and U.S. senator. The War Memorial Theater and ballroom were added in 1962 and another wing in 1993. \nEmagine Entertainment operates 18 theaters in Michigan, Minnesota and Illinois. \nContact Zlati Meyer: 313-223-4439 or zmeyer@freepress.com.
