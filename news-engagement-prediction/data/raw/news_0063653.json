They recently stopped me from working with them. I am a graduate of Geography Education, BSc to be precise. \n“This predicament made me to withdraw my son from school and to send him to the village. \n“I’ve just picked up a teaching job and I’m hoping that when they pay me, I will settle my landlord with half of the salary and balance him later. \n“But if he says he does not want me in his house, he should give me three months more to vacate his house,” he said. \nChioma, the second defendant, however, told the court that she had never had any issue with her landlord for the past 10 years she had been staying in the compound. \n“I have, however, not been doing anything currently and my husband left me the moment I took in for the baby I’m carrying now,” she said. \nThe plaintiff, Hassan, however, said he would only give both tenants one week to vacate his premises. \nHe stressed that they should go with the arrears as he was no longer interested. \n“Both are yearly tenants. Their house rents expired since September 2016, but they had refused to renew their rents of N12, 500 each,” he said. \nThe Chief Magistrate, Mr Victor Manga, pleaded with the plaintiff to exercise little patience with the defendants and give them one month within which to look for alternative accommodation. He adjourned the case till March 23 for report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:56:40.135+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
