Gill, 68, will return to prison after a high-speed chase resulted in him getting caught with two pounds of cocaine. Gill’s sentence was commuted in 2015 by then-President Barack Obama. \nGill was arrested after police said he bought 2 pounds of cocaine in a parking lot. According to filing papers, sheriffs in an unmarked car attempted to stop Gill, who instead took off on a high-speed chase that ended when he collided with another vehicle, the New York Post reported . \nGill’s sentence for cocaine and heroin distribution was one of the 1,715 prison sentences that Obama commuted. His early release was cosigned by his prison warden who said, “ Robert has reformed and rehabilitated himself and poses no threat to the outside world. ” \nUnfortunately, Gill allegedly claimed that he was going to sell the cocaine to make money and then “ would be paying a female $26,000 for the cocaine, ” the affidavit said. \nGill is being held without bail. ‘Formerly incarcerated’ vs ‘felon’: Should the US use different language for ex-prisoners? https://t.co/34cSY6UR6M pic.twitter.com/jiV6uFFEoY", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T10:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T05:51:52.833+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
