Get Me Out of Here! (Pic: Channel 10). \nCasey Donovan is the real deal. That’s why Australia has fallen in love with her all over again. \nShe’s vulnerable to a point, yet she is a strong, fiercely loyal and funny leader. \nAnd she’s grown into an impressively articulate adult, holding her own in the jungle camp on I’m A Celebrity … Get Me Out Of Here! against seasoned outspoken show business veterans like radio shock jock Steve Price. \nWhen Jay Laga’aia was voted out this week, he said he’d like to see Casey take on camp leader responsibilities. \n“Casey doesn’t have to swing a big stick, she just needs to whistle once, call twice and everybody stops,” he said after being evicted. “The best bet is to chill out and listen to what the girl has to say.” media_camera Sydney Confidential chief reporter Jonathon Moran with his friend and former flatmate, singer Casey Donovan. (Pic: Supplied). \nThis description is light and shade from the shy and awkward 16-year-old that won Australian Idol back in 2004. \nBut first a disclosure: I have known Casey for 13 years... we’re good mates and even used to live together as housemates. \nWe first met on the day the top 10 series two Australian Idol contestants were introduced to media at Sydney’s Darling Harbour. \nThat day she wore dark baggy shorts to her calf, boots and a big jumper. She had dreadlocks and when I interviewed her, she struggled to look me in the eye and tucked her hands up in her sleeves nervously. She had a plastic spider in her pocket, a good-luck charm given to her by a friend. \nCasey was extremely insecure, I could see that a mile away. media_camera Casey Donovan in her earlier days. “I looked like a fat little boy,” she said of her look. (Pic: Supplied) \nBut she came out of her shell when she sang. Her voice was and is second to none. That’s why she won and why the series grand final was watched by more than 3.35 million people and remains the highest rating Idol episode ever. \n“I had dreadlocks, I wore guys clothes and wore shorts that sat under my gut. I always looked like a fat little boy,” she said of her Idol look. \n“I never expected to get as far as I did and even to this day I find it hard to come to terms with me winning that contest because I’ve always been the second place getter, I’ve always been the person that does things but never gets to where I want to be. I am always that person that is good but not good enough.” media_camera Casey winning Australian Idol in 2004 remains the highest rating Idol episode. (Pic: News Corp) \nIt’s been a joy watching her on I’m A Celebrity … Get Me Out Of Here! This is the Casey I know and love. Casey doesn’t claim to be perfect. She had a tough childhood, not having a relationship with her indigenous father when she was young. She wasn’t the popular one at school. She’s not a size eight. She’s been unlucky in love — good on her for being brave and sharing her catfish story. \nShe was dumped by her record label not long after winning Idol because she didn’t fit the pop star cookie cutter mould. Since then, she’s continued to work in show business but more on the periphery. She has starred in stage productions, from Shakespeare to The Sapphires and We Will Rock You.
