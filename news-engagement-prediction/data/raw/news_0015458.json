Everybody sees the red jackets and they’re not too sure what they’re all about. It’s going to help us do that,” Edmonton patroller Rich Henschel said. \n“We’ve got incredible participation across the web. We’ve had hits from Ottawa, Newfoundland, Vancouver. We even have a group doing this on Parliament Hill.” \nGuinness needs to verify whether the snow angels record was broken Saturday, which takes time. \nThe event was part of Canadian Ski Patrol Day. \nThere are 4,500 volunteer ski patrollers at more than 220 ski areas across Canada. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T04:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T09:49:17.259+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
