Advertisement More by this Author \nCord leader Raila Odingaâ€™s daughter Rosemary has been admitted to a hospital in Nairobi and is expected to undergo surgery to remove a suspected tumour in her brain. \nSources privy to the matter said Ms Odinga had complained of a headache last weekend, prompting her family to rush her to hospital. \nThe tumour is said to be non-cancerous and doctors suspect it could be applying pressure on her brain and hence causing the headache. \nIt is not clear whether the family knew about the existence of the tumour before her admission last Friday. \nMs Odinga was first admitted at Nairobi Hospital on Friday after complaining of headaches, before being transferred to Aga Khan University Hospital on Monday for further check-ups. \nIt is also not clear why she was taken to the two private hospitals before finally being transferred to Aga Khan University Hospital.
