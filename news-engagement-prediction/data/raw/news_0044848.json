2017 3:00pm \nBEN Ryan, the man who spearheaded Fiji’s Olympic sevens gold medal-winning campaign, says Australia’s men’s team would benefit if they were granted access to fringe Super Rugby players. \nDespite Australia surpassing expectations with a fourth-placed finish at the Sydney Sevens earlier this month, it’s been just under five years since the team won a leg on the world series tour. \nAustralia’s best finish in the overall standings in the last five years is fourth, with South Africa, England, New Zealand and Fiji dominating. \nIn 2016-17, Australia sits sixth after poor performances in Cape Town and Wellington, although their struggles this season can somewhat be attributed to a horrendous injury toll. media_camera Australia lost to New Zealand in the third-place playoff at the Sydney Sevens. \nOne of the main hurdles the men’s sevens program faces — which the women’s team does not — is that the best talent is usually snapped up by Australia’s five Super Rugby franchises like lollies in the school playground. \nCameron Clark, Con Foley and Tom Cusack all signed with Super Rugby teams after the Olympics, while world series rookie of the year Henry Hutchison was hotly pursued. \nIn recent years Wallabies regulars Bernard Foley, Nick Phipps, Liam Gill and Sean McMahon all started their professional careers in sevens, before moving into Super Rugby. \nBut while the sevens program has been a pathway for many, Ryan believes that all levels of Australian rugby could be strengthened if the sevens program was given licence to tap into the talent not featuring week-in, week-out in the 15-a-side game. \n“They suffer the same as New Zealand, England and France, being in the top-tier, less so South Africa,” Ryan told foxsports.com.au \n“They’ve got really good young players in Super Rugby that aren’t necessarily on the starting roster and might not even be on the bench, but they (Australian sevens) can’t get their hands on them because they don’t release them in Super Rugby. \n“And if they did I think they would all benefit. \n“I’m sure, I’ve got no doubt, that (sevens coach) Andy (Friend) and (ARU boss) Bill Pulver and everybody else have tried their hardest, and there’s probably stuff we don’t know about behind the scenes that they’re trying to get. \n“But if your cattle’s not good enough then you’re always going to struggle.” \nIn last season’s Olympic year, Australia experimented by signing three Wallaby backs in Quade Cooper, Henry Speight and Nick Cummins. \nNo promises were made of the trio making the final 12-man Olympic squad, but it was assumed that they would canter in. \nThey didn’t. \nSpeight eventually travelled as a reserve to the Games, but wasn’t used. \nCooper and Cummins were left out with injury, form and, in the former’s case, club commitments in France cruelling their bids for selection. \nIn truth, none of the three took their opportunities with both hands. \nHowever, Speight was beginning to look a serious threat, before another injury slowed his momentum. \nCooper, too, showed glimpses of what he could do in his two tournaments. \nOthers, such as flankers Liam Gill, Michael Wells and Matt Lucas, who were interested in having a late crack and boast sevens experience, were ignored and not invited into camp. media_camera Henry Speight (centre) was a travelling reserve at the Rio Olympics. \nAfter the Sydney Sevens, Friend, a former Super Rugby coach, told reporters that he would only look at 15-a-side players if they committed themselves exclusively to the sevens program for six months, citing the differences in the game. \n“It’s a different game,’ Friend said. \n“If there’s fringe players who could spend six months with us and then push for a spot, by all means. \n“But if you’re not in a Super Rugby top 23, you’re not going to make our top 25. \n“It is really two different games now. \n“I just think the fitness aspect of it, two very different games, so I won’t be looking at those blokes.” media_camera South Africa’s Seabelo Senatla is rejoining the Stormers in Super Rugby. \nYet, the case of Seabelo Senatla provides an interesting case. \nThe 24-year-old Blitzbok flyer is the reigning world series player of the year. \nBut after focusing solely on sevens in 2016 and the start of the season, he will now return to the Stormers — after making his debut for the Super Rugby team in 2014. \nHis last performance in a Blitzbok jersey led them to a third 2016-17 tournament win in Sydney. \nSeabelo won’t be lost to the sevens circuit, however, with his contract allowing him to play the first few stages of each season in the lead-up to Super Rugby, which kicks off in February. \nAnd Ryan, who is now a coaching consultant with Wales Rugby, believes that fringe Super Rugby players would will benefit by playing sevens. \n“No doubt about it,” Ryan said. \n“You’ve seen that with other players that have come in from wherever it is — Top 14 in France to Fiji or Premiership in England, ITM or Super Rugby in New Zealand — they’ve all come back and they’ve killed it. \n“You look at Senatla now, he’s going to Super Rugby but he’ll be great. \n“I think in Australia, sevens isn’t seen by the rugby public as big as it is in other countries and I think maybe they’re doing it a bit of disservice because they have got good teams. \n“And obviously the women’s team are unbelievable at the moment and Walshy’s (coach Tim Walsh) done just a staggeringly good job there, alongside some very good girls who have got a great attitude. \n“So that’s just such a good news story for Australian rugby at the moment. \n“But I think, perhaps, it’s just a shame that it doesn’t seem to have grabbed the attention it deserves. \n“Maybe it will, maybe the success of the Sydney tournament’s going to do it because Adelaide didn’t really ever work, the Gold Coast never really worked, when it was in Brisbane it didn’t really work and now Sydney’s working. \n“Maybe that’s the thing that’s going to ignite more interest in it.” media_camera Ben Ryan says Australian rugby would benefit if Super Rugby players could play for the sevens team. \nFriend’s side is expected to welcome back a number of its experienced players ahead of next month’s Las Vegas Sevens, including ex-captain Ed Jenkins, Jesse Parahi, Nick Malouf, Tom Lucas and John Porch. \nWhile the public hasn’t seen the best of the Australian team this season, Ryan believes it’s not long until they’re threatening for titles once again. \n“They’re going through a rough period, but they’ve got some wise old heads behind the scenes and I’m sure they’ll come through,” he said. \n“At the moment all their best players, apart from Chucky (Stannard), are unavailable and until they get them back… they’ve got great facilities, I mean the training base is good, they’ve got good coaches, they’ve got good staff. \n“The boys that aren’t injured are good rugby players and if you remember in the last couple of years Fiji have had some real ding-dongs with Australia and that was a vintage Fijian side. \n“And we lost to the Aussies the year before under Geraint (John), both in Port Elizabeth and Dubai.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:27:23.966+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
