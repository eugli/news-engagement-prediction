Oh where do I even begin? Honestly, it took me quite some time to come up with an introduction for this article. I agree that most characters on television are way too fictional and do not make any sense. But I am just tired of seeing Tanuja as a damsel in distress all the friggin’ time! The actors and writers are so lazy that you will literally hear the same dialogue for more than two days. There was an episode where they just kept talking about breaking promises in 10 different ways. But let’s get back to Tanuja. \nSo Tanuja is a reincarnation of Tanu who was Rishi’s wife and who died to save him. Rishi is some 20 years older than her but obviously doesn’t look older. Tanuja comes to Mumbai looking for a job and manages to get one at her pichle janam ka pyaar Rishi’s office. But we only saw her work in the office for a couple of days. And during this time, Rishi is an angry not-so-young man who doesn’t entertain women or anyone else in general after his wife passed away. Tanuja spends more time playing caretaker to Rishi’s Beeji than work as his secretary.

Not even the servants. A lot of shit goes down and Tanuja saves Rishi from a fire accident. And obviously, she takes Tanu’s face after the plastic surgery which makes Rishi hate her even more. Her grandmother and Aunt, who have raised her, don’t really care about her and throw her out of the house after she fails to make Rishi fall in love with her even after taking Tanu’s face. \nThen later on, Tanuja ‘accidentally’ marries Rishi after Raaj persuades her to do so. Since Raaj is a father figure to her, she does as she is told. I mean she doesn’t even reveal that the brides have been swapped till the very last moment. And let me remind you that Rishi hates Tanuja. He doesn’t even want to see her face especially after the plastic surgery. But who cares? Tanuja still loves someone who has humiliated her and expressed his hatred towards her numerous times. (ALSO READ: Like Kasam Tere Pyaar Ki, 5 times TV shows turned to plastic surgeries to increase TRPs ) \nAnd then comes the mother-in-law, Rano. Now Rano has never approved of his son’s choice in women since she wants someone of her status to become her daughter-in-law. She never liked Tanu and she hates Tanuja so much that she has literally thrown her out of the house several times. Tanuja still doesn’t get the signal that no one in the house really wants her to stay and that she is the accidental bahu in the family. Why would you want to live with a husband who hates you and a mother-in-law who hates you even more and then blame it on fate? \nShe usually complaints to the moon about her fate and why God is so evil with her but never used her brain to come up with a solution. In the ongoing track, she is finally successfully thrown out of the house for good and stays in a temple because she has nowhere else to go. She faints in a market and a lady takes her home. And this lady is involved in human trafficking and puts a price on Tanuja. \nNow Tanuja manages to run but the goons are still chasing her. It was bad enough that she trusted a stranger, went to stay in her house and had the drugged food but she also stops a random car and gets into the car which leads her back to where the chase began. How incredibly naive do you have to be to get into a stranger’s car? And it’s tiring to listen to her blame everything on fate rather that doing something about her life. It’s really disturbing to see a female character being portrayed in such a weak manner. \nAnd I would love to see Tanuja use her brain for once and not blame everything on the moon. What is the moon going to do when you yourself don’t do anything? If only the character was more female-friendly and did not show the woman as a victim every time, the show would have been more interesting. Every other saas-bahu saga on television currently portrays women as stronger entities but this woman is beyond my understanding. I wish Tanuja’s character had developed into a stronger one. Someone who stops victimising herself and acts on it instead. \nDon’t you think? Post your thoughts in the comments below and stay hooked with us for more.
