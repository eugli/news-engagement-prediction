(Reuters) Despite speculations of a massive shortage of sugar, the government feels the country has adequate stocks to meet consumption in the current marketing year through September, thanks to carry-forward stocks of 7.1 million tonnes from 2015-16, reports Banikinkar Pattanayak in New Delhi. The ministry has retained its earlier production forecast of 22.5 million tonnes for 2016-17 for now, official sources told FE, which is higher than the 21.3 million tonnes projected earlier by millers’ body ISMA and just 20 million tonnes estimated by some refiners and traders.\nThe food ministry held a meeting with representatives of sugar mills on Tuesday to discuss prices, supplies and consumption of the sweetener as well as cane arrears, the sources said.\nThat the pace of price rise has slowed lately despite strong speculations about a shortage and offtake of sugar has dropped from a year before points to the fact that there is ample availability of sugar in the market, the sources said. According to official data, the monthly average price of sugar in the wholesale market rose just 6.8% since June last year, against an almost 19% jump between January and May 2016.\n“There is no change to the estimate as of now. If there is any need for a revision, the government may do so, but only after consulting cane commissioners. But no change is expected before late March. There is absolutely nothing alarming about the supply situation,” said a senior government official.\nYou May Also Want To Watch:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T14:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T07:42:15.580+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
