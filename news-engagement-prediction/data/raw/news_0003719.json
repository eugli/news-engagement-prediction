The downgraded version of Huawei's flagship smartphone hasn't been announced yet, but news about the P10 Lite emerged about a week ago .A certain Huawei phone with model number WAS-AL00 was certified at TENAA, the Chinese regulatory commission, earlier this month. The smartphone's specs include a 2.1GHz octa-core Kirin CPU, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage.Today, another unannounced Huawei handset with model number WAS-LX1A was spotted in Geekbench's database. While the model numbers are different, the smartphones do share some specs.For example, the newly spotted device is equipped with an octa-core Kirin 655 processor , coupled with 4GB RAM; sounds familiar? Also, it runs Android 7.0 Nougat operating system, which makes perfect sense for a mid-range smartphone launched in 2017.The rest of the phone's specs are still a mystery, but we're destined to find out more later this month anyway, so stay tuned if you're into Huawei products.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T12:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T10:16:01.113+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
