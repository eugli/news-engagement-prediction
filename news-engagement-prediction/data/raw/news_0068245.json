Melissa Key Lauren Tucker learned about Sealed Air Corp. moving to Charlotte from a member of her family. “I knew I would end up there,” she says. But her plate was already full. Tucker was completing an exhausting MBA program through the University of South Carolina’s Darla Moore School of Business while working full time. She attended classes at the school’s satellite locations in Charlotte and Charleston and drove to Columbia one Saturday a month for all-day classes. Lauren Tucker, Sealed Air Corp. Melissa Key Then she decided she wanted to be at Sealed Air (NYSE: SEE). “It was a challenging, rewarding, but very busy time as I balanced the academic demands and starting at a new company and a new role,” Tucker says. She started work a month after connecting with a recruiter over LinkedIn and finishing her MBA in December. Why law? I actually started out in architecture. I was in the very early stages of my career and was in front of my computer a lot, doing CAD drawings, modeling and, frankly, I was bored. It was one of those situations where in architecture school you think you are going to be the next Frank Gehry and you become fixated on that aspiration. I realized very quickly that I was more interested in the business of our architecture firm and how the firm functioned rather than the work I was doing at the architecture firm. In 2008, while having lunch with a mentor of mine who was a lawyer, he said, “Why don’t you go to law school?” It was an opportune time to switch careers in the architecture, engineering and construction industry as the housing and real estate market crashed. Why Sealed Air? I knew about Sealed Air and its business, and was very interested in the transformative direction it was taking from a sustainability, innovation and collaborative mindset with its plans to create a world-class business hub in Charlotte. I also wanted to work for a global company again. After I left Husqvarna for a U.S.-based technology company, I missed the global exposure. Tell me the most interesting thing that you’ve been working on there. Enhancing our bribery and corruption programs worldwide is fascinating. I have been able to work with our regional legal and business teams to design and implement a third-party due diligence program. The landscape for managing these issues is extremely complex because of the different laws, cultures and parties involved globally. Corruption and bribery can affect a company’s financial standing, its reputation as well as the overall competitive landscape in the marketplace. I also will add the ever-changing employment regulations on a state-to-state basis and with the federal transition of leadership will be interesting and continue to be challenging for companies such as Sealed Air that do business in all 50 states.
