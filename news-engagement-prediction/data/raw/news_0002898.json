He told reporters the man launched himself at the soldiers when they told him that he couldn’t bring his bags into the Carrousel du Louvre shopping mall underneath the world-famous museum where the “Mona Lisa” hangs. \nScary stuff. \nPresident Trump didn’t waste any time letting the world know what he thought about it. A new radical Islamic terrorist has just attacked in Louvre Museum in Paris. Tourists were locked down. France on edge again. GET SMART U.S. \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2017 \nCan’t argue with that. \nThis Trump guy never sleeps. I love it. \nFrance doesn’t really seem to be taking this whole terrorism thing seriously. \nLooks like Le Pen is their only shot to grab this thing by the horns.
