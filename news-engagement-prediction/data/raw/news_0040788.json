This is not Canadian values, it is very un-Canadian.”\n“When somebody sent me the picture I thought somebody had photoshopped it.”\nRaj, who immigrated to Canada in the late 1990s, says everyone is welcome at the clinic and he would like the opportunity to speak with the person responsible for the changes to the sign.\n“These sorts of things are definitely appearing more than before,” said Raj of his perceived increase in the number of acts of intolerance in Calgary. “I still feel that this is one single person’s misunderstanding. We would definitely like that person to come forward and talk with us.”\nRaj has corrected the sign and reported the incident to the Calgary Police Service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T02:38:40.622+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
