It is unclear, though, when the line to Olympic Park will be built. \nRosehill Racecourse is on the list of stops being built in the first phase of construction. \nMs Berejiklian confirmed the long-awaited finalised route for the light rail on Friday morning, saying it will revitalise parts of Western Sydney.
