But this year, several New England Patriots are expected to skip. \nAmong them is Devin McCourty, who told TIME magazine that he “doesn’t feel accepted” due to the “president having so many strong opinions and prejudices.\" \nLaGarrette Blount said much the same, telling The Rich Eisen Show Thursday: “I don't feel welcome in that house.” \nMartellus Bennett, Dont’a Hightower and Chris Long have also said they won’t go, according to NBC. \nIt wouldn’t be the first political statement for Bennett and McCourty, who raised their fists in solidarity with black power during the pre-game singing of the Star-Spangled Banner at a game last September. \nIt also wouldn’t be the time pro athletes snubbed a president. Bostin Bruins goalie Tim Thomas refused to meet Barack Obama in 2012. Thomas said at the time that he believed the government had “grown out of control, threatening the Rights, Liberties, and Property of the People.” \nAnd Patriots star quarterback Tom Brady didn’t show up to meet Barack Obama after his 2015 Super Bowl win, citing a “family commitment.” \nBrady is expected to attend this time. Trump and Brady are friends, according to the president. \nNo date has been set for the meeting but White House Press Secretary said the president is “looking very much forward” to meeting the team. \nWith a report from CTV’s Peter Akman Related Stories ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T10:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T05:23:33.525+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
