(ABC News: Laura Beavis) \nThe nickname stems from the impossible task Australia's 2/40th Battalion, made up mostly of Tasmanians, was assigned in February 1942 soon after Japan had entered the war. \nIll-equipped and undersupplied, the 2/40th were ordered to defend an airfield in Timor against an expected attack, which came on February 20. \n\"There were only 919 of them, versus a reported 23,000 Japanese invasion force,\" Rod Stone, coordinator of the Friends of the 2/40th Battalion, said at a ceremony in Launceston to remember the men. \nAfter several days of intense fighting, with food and ammunition supplies exhausted, the 2/40th were sent a message by the Japanese commanders; surrender or be bombed out of existence.

Only two members are still alive and live in Hobart. \n\"The Burma railway has a huge slice of Tasmanian influence in it,\" Mr Stone said. \n\"The younger generation need to be aware of the respect that's due for these men who faced insurmountable odds and held us in very, very good stead for our freedom and our values that we have in society today.\" 'Need to keep telling their stories' \nChris Cassidy carried the battalion's flag during today's march, in honour of his father Ronald Cassidy. \nHe said he and his siblings had deep respect for what their father had endured, although they had to learn about his experience from his friends. \n\"Dad was our hero. What he went through, and the men who went through with him, which they never spoke of much, only from their mates,\" Mr Cassidy said. \n\"They talked about other men, but they wouldn't talk about themselves.\" Photo: Friends and relatives of 2/40th Battalion at the ceremony to honour the men. (ABC News: Laura Beavis) \nMr Stone's father was with Mr Cassidy's father Ron on the Burma Railway. He said his dad had nominated Mr Stone as having \"saved his life\". \n\"Our family had no idea ... we all have come to appreciate these men just don't talk about things, they just keep it to themselves, and it was a big surprise to the family.\" \nAnother battalion member's son, Graeme Shields, said his father was also reluctant to speak of his experiences. \n\"He was very damaged by it, he came back with war neurosis and he was a broken man, and our family relived the war for 16 years after,\" Mr Shields said. \nMr Stone said the 2/40th's descendants need to keep telling their stories. \n\"They were brutal stories, but they are just stories of great perseverance and great trials under extreme pressure.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T14:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T09:50:31.274+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
