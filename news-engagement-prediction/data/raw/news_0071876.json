As he turns his sights to Australia, he’s confident of another victory .\n“This is the moment — this is the time,” Wolfson said.\n“You guys are so far ahead of where we were when we won. You have more public support and you have an entire global track record to point to, showing that ending marriage discrimination doesn’t hurt anyone and isn’t a leap into the dark.”\nOver the course of four decades of activism, Wolfson helped take the American homosexual community from “a despised minority” to recipients of the legal right to marry.\nWith momentum for change in Australia growing — consistent polling shows support at around 70 per cent — Wolfson has a wealth of advice for the local campaign.\nmedia_camera Evan Wolfson with former US Vice President Joe Biden at a Freedom To Marry celebration event after the Supreme Court ruling in 2015.

Even those in favour should be reminded.\n“Right now, this is the moment we really need elected officials to hear from families across Australia — gay and non-gay families need to make their voices heard.\n“Contact them, tell them you want them to get the job done.”\nmedia_camera Public support for marriage equality is growing and Evan Wolfson believes “now is the time” to get it done.
