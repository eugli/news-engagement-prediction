A fight ensued between her and the attacker and the wife injured her fingers. The officer drew his firearm and the men fled, taking the handbag with them.” \nThe officer chased the men for about 200m. \n“During the chase the robber turned around and drew his firearm; the officer did the same and fired three shots at the suspect.” \nThe Phoenix police station later received a call from a clinic near Bester informing them that a man with three gunshot wounds had been dropped off and had died. \nPost ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:24:48.239+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
