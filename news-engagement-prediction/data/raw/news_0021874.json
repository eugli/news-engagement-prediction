He was caught at long-on off the first ball of the last over trying to clear the boundary with a hit which would have taken him past Gary Kirsten 's long-standing South African best of 188 not out, made against the United Arab Emirates in Rawalpindi during the 1996 World Cup.\nDu Plessis shared century partnerships with Quinton de Kock (55) and captain AB de Villiers (64).\nSri Lankan hopes flickered briefly when Hashim Amla was caught at first slip off Lahiru Kumara for one and South Africa were able to score only four runs in the first three overs.\nBut Du Plessis and De Kock quickly gained control, with the left-handed De Kock finding form for the first time in the series, reaching a half-century off only 40 balls as he and Du Plessis put on 100 off 87 balls for the second wicket.\nDe Kock hit seven fours and two sixes in his 46-ball innings before he was caught at slip off left-arm spinner Sachith Pathirana.\nDu Plessis and De Villiers added 137 off 122 balls for the third wicket before De Villiers missed a sweep against Pathirana and was bowled for 64 off 62 balls. He hit four fours.\nPathirana was Sri Lanka's most successful bowler, taking two for 55 and conceding only two boundaries in his ten overs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T18:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T06:23:27.716+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
