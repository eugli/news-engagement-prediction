Michael Chow/azcentral.com \nArtist's rendering of proposed Coyotes arena in Tempe. (Photo: Arizona Coyotes) \nA plan to build a new home for the Arizona Coyotes in Tempe is dead.\nArizona State University on Friday evening said the university \"has no intention of proceeding to sign a development agreement or an option to lease or any other agreement with the Coyotes.\"\nIn November, a master developer hired by ASU to develop a 330-acre athletic district south of Tempe Town Lake entered into negotiations with the Coyotes to produce a plan for 58 acres for a new home for the Coyotes and an attached arena for use by Sun Devil Athletics.\nEarlier this week, legislation introduced by Sen. Bob Worsley, R-Mesa, would have created a funding mechanism to build the rinks for the Coyotes and ASU. The legislation would create a 28-acre \"community engagement district\" that would house ice rinks for the Coyotes, as well as ASU's hockey teams within the confines of ASU's Athletic Stadium District.\nWorsley said he agreed to sponsor the legislation in order to keep the Coyotes from leaving the state, and because the financing portion of the deal would not sap the state's general fund of existing revenue.\nThe Coyotes in November held a press conference to announce that plans were in the works to bring the team to Tempe. The announcement was the latest turn in an ongoing drama involving Valley sports teams seeking better facilities. The Arizona Diamondbacks and Phoenix Suns also want new homes. Only the Arizona Cardinals are content playing in University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale.\n\"The two cannot be connected and there is no desire to conflate the two,\" he said of financing arrangements, which are also know as tax-increment financing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T08:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T05:04:42.322+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
