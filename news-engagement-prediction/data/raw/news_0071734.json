By David Moye \nDonald Trump’s presidency has cast a pall over the nation, so now witches are casting a spell against him. \nA document making its rounds among the witch community is asking people who practice the craft to perform a monthly binding ritual until the president is removed from office. \nIn order to work, the mass spell must be performed at midnight EST on every waning crescent moon. \nThe first one is happening on Friday and will be followed by similar spell cast events on March 26, April 24 and May 23 and beyond. \nUnless, of course, Trump is cast out of office before then. \nHe stressed that a binding spell is different than a curse or hex. \n“It’s a restraint, not harm,” Hughes told The Huffington Post. “I see it as self-defense.” \nHughes said he heard that two separate witch groups were planning the spells and asked if he could take it to a wider audience. \nThe spell instructions have gone viral, and there is a group on Facebook dedicated to answering all the questions people may have. \nPerforming the spell takes a good deal of dedication, including amassing the following: Unflattering photo of Trump Tiny stub of an orange candle or orange carrot A pin or small nail (to inscribe candle) White candle (any size), representing the element of Fire Small bowl of water, representing elemental Water Small bowl of salt, representing elemental Earth Feather (any), representing the element of Air Matches or lighter Ashtray or dish of sand \nPractitioners are supposed to prepare for by writing “Donald J. Trump” on the orange candle stub with a pin or nail. They then arrange the other items in a circle and lean the Tower card against something so that it’s standing up. \nHughes suggests reading the 23rd Psalm aloud before beginning the spell by lighting a white candle. \nThe complete spell can be read here, but some of the lines include: \n“Hear me, oh spirits Of Water, Earth, Fire, and Air Heavenly hosts Demons of the infernal realms And spirits of the ancestors (Light inscribed orange candle stub) I call upon you", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:43:48.792+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
