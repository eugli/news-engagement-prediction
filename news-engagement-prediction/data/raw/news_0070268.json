The Ohio Republican says he started laughing when he heard President Donald Trump and Republicans promise swift action on undoing and replacing the health law.\nHe says: \"Republicans never ever agree on health care.\"\nBoehner spoke at a health care conference in Orlando. His remarks were reported by Politico.\nHe predicts that in the end, Republicans will leave the basic framework of the Affordable Care Act in place and make relatively modest changes.\nAs speaker, Boehner promised numerous times to repeal and replace Obamacare in full. He presided over a 2013 government shutdown aimed at taking money away from the law.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:20:12.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
