Dial Emmy for Murder followed on the heels of her first novel, Death in Daytime, and centers around the same main character, Alexis Peterson, a daytime soap opera star whose co-presenter goes missing on the night of the Daytime Emmy Awards show. As an industry insider, Alexis helps the police solve the case as the body count rises. Davidson wrote four soap opera mysteries in all, and is currently writing the second draft of this one that was optioned. She told Daily Dish she will star in the film, as well as co-write and executive produce, and is looking forward to the fun of the project, which she shared happily on Twitter (see below). \nDavidson stars in The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills in addition to playing her role on ‚ÄúThe Young and the Restless,‚Äù which she has played on and off since 1984. Davidson played Kelly Capwell on ‚ÄúSanta Barbara‚Äù from 1992 ‚Äì 1993, and during the years 1993 ‚Äì 2015, she spent time on another soap opera, ‚ÄúDays of our Lives.‚Äù Her principle character there was Kristen DiMera, but at one point she played five characters simultaneously, including Susan Banks. Davidson‚Äôs ‚ÄúY&R‚Äù character crossed over to ‚ÄúThe Bold and the Beautiful‚Äù in 2007 ‚Äì 2008 as well. Currently, her storyline on ‚ÄúY&R‚Äù has Ashley developing a relationship with Ravi (Abhi Sinha) , a younger computer tech she hired at Jabot. It‚Äôs unclear yet whether this will become more than a friendship with a co-worker, but she certainly seems to be jealous of him spending time with her former sister-in-law, Phyllis (Gina Tognoni). \nSoaps.com will post updates about Davidson‚Äôs movie as they become available.
