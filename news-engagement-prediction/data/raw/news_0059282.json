Emigration to those countries is what the boffins called today 'statistically significant'. It was up 12,000 to 39,000. \nBut there has been a spike in those coming to the UK from the EU2 countries: Romania and Bulgaria. \nMigration from those counties was up 19,000 to 74,000 which is the highest estimate recorded. \nWhat stands out for me, however, is not the EU numbers in isolation but the total numbers. \nThursday's figures show there are as many people coming to the UK from outside the EU as from within it. \nSome 165,000 EU citizens arrived here in those 12 months compared to a similar number - 164,000 - of non-EU citizens. \nThe point being that the UK government can already control migration from outside the EU - and it's just as high as the numbers from inside the EU, which was one of the main reasons why people voted for Brexit. \nLast week, in his widely criticised speech, former prime minister Tony Blair suggested British voters are more concerned about immigration from Asia and India than they are about EU migrants. \nMr Blair suggested voters might feel betrayed if they don't also see a reduction in non-EU migration after Brexit. \nSo the task for the government is immense. \nWhen Brexit happens in 2019, the government will be able to control all areas of migration but these figures show it's not delivering its promise to keep immigration below 100,000 even when you strip out those who came from the EU.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T17:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T13:00:01.975+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
