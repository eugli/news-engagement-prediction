Youssef Boudlal/REUTERS \nYes, the 36-year-old touched on a number of topics during his interview with The Hollywood Reporter, but, I don’t think he dropped a more interesting tidbit than when he revealed the real reason he left famed boy band *NSYNC. Giphy \nSo, why did Justin Timberlake bounce out on JC Chasez, Chris Kirkpatrick, Joey Fatone and Lance Bass? \nWell, according to JT, it’s because *NSYNC was “too big.” Speaking about his decision to leave in 2002, Timberlake said, \nWe were on a stadium tour, and I just felt like the whole thing was too big. \nHe continued, \nIt started as a fun snowball fight that was becoming an avalanche. And, also, I was growing out of it. I felt like I cared more about the music than some of the other people in the group. And I felt like I had other music I wanted to make and that I needed to follow my heart. \nDamn, dude. Now who’s tearing up whose heart? \nAfter he left *NSYNC, Justin Timberlake performed his first solo single, “Like I Love You,” at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards. \nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, that song reached as high as No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and JT’s first solo album, Justified , sold three million copies. \nThe rest, as they say, is history. \nIn case you’re curious, it appears Jimmy Fallon spoke with The Hollywood Reporter and dished about how his friendship with Justin Timberlake began. YouTube \nSpeaking on the roots of their bromance, Fallon said, \nI was hosting [the 2002 VMAs] by myself for the first time, and Justin was performing by himself for the first time, so we really bonded that night. \nOur dressing rooms were connected, and we were both pacing, trying to calm each other down. ‘You’re going to be great,’ ‘No, you’re going to be great.’ And we’ve just been pals ever since. \nThe more you know, right? \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
