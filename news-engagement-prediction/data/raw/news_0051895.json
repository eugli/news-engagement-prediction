I am now careful because I know what happened to them,” Shaina said of her sisters, singer-actress Vina Morales, Sheryl and Sheila Magdayao. \n“Of course, no two people are alike. It’s just that through their experiences, I no longer take relationships and commitment lightly. I take my time. I will make sure that when I finally let another guy into my life, he will not just make me cry,” the actress declared. ADVERTISEMENT \nShaina’s last relationship, which lasted for almost two years, was with fellow Kapamilya talent John Lloyd Cruz. They broke up in 2012. \n“While I’m sure that it will not happen anytime soon, I promise to tell all of you when I eventually find my better half,” she told reporters during the press conference of “The Better Half,” her latest afternoon drama series on ABS-CBN. \n“I’m not ready to commit to anyone just yet. I have to be a whole person first before that can happen. I will be ready [to love again] when I can finally say that I don’t need someone else to make me happy,” the 27-year-old actress declared. \nShaina also refused to answer questions on whether or not she was open to reconciling with any of her ex-boyfriends. “I don’t want them to think I’m creating an issue out of nothing, especially now that I’m promoting a show. I’m being careful not to mention names of individuals who aren’t part of this series.” \nIn “The Better Half,” Shaina plays Camille, who is convinced that she lost her husband Marco (Carlo Aquino) to a plane accident. She is already married to Rafael (JC de Vera) when she discovers that Marco is still alive. \nShaina said she has given her “full attention” to playing Camille. “I have embraced her. I can relate to her struggles. She has loved Marco dearly, but when she met Rafael, she was sure that it was time for her to move on,” the actress explained. \n“I especially liked what Camile said, ‘Ayaw kong magpalunod sa lungkot ng nakaraan.’ I appreciate it that, in the script, there are good reasons why Camille says or does things.” \n“The Better Half” is directed by Jeffrey Jeturian and also stars Denise Laurel, Carmi Martin, Epy Quizon, Nadia Montenegro and Rommel Padilla. \nIt replaced “Doble Kara” in the network’s weekday afternoon timeslot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:10:57.104+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
