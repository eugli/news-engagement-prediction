'I was in Gran Canaria with my missus and the phone rang. It was the manager saying, \"Can you come back?\"\n'If the manager calls to say you've done well and he wants you back then it is good, it's a positive sign.\nNathan Ake is in the Chelsea squad and the Blues are nine points clear at the top of the table\nThe young Dutchman has been at Chelsea since 2011 and is enjoying his breakthrough season\nAke was recalled by Antonio Conte after going on loan to Bournemouth earlier this season\n'But I felt a bit nervous to be honest. I hadn't been at Chelsea for a long time. I left two years ago. It felt like a long time and I wasn't sure how it would be.'\nOld friends and a new boss were ready to embrace the 21-year-old on return from his loan spell, however, and he was on the bench against Hull and played for 90 minutes in the FA Cup fourth round against Brentford.\nIt was his first Chelsea start since a League Cup tie at Shrewsbury in October 2014.\n'The manager said he sees me in different positions, as a left wing-back and a left centre back,' said Ake, who can also operate in midfield. 'He told me to train well and wait for my opportunities. The first one in the FA Cup went quite well. It can always be better.\n'Hopefully I can get more chances to express myself and show what I've learned over the last couple of years. That's my main aim. I don't want to look too far ahead.\n'This is the road I took. It was a difficult one because everybody said it would be impossible to break through here. That's why I want to break through. Just to show it is possible.'\nAke is determined to be a mainstay at Chelsea to prove it is possible to break into the team\nAke revealed the manager sees him playing in various positions at the back for the Blues\nAke, who has impressed in the Premier League, sat down with Sportsmail's Matt Barlow\nNATHAN AKE CAREER Chelsea (2012- )\nAppearances: 13 Goals: 0\nReading (2015) - loan\nAppearances: 5 Goals: 0\nWatford (2015-16) - loan\nAppearances: 24 Goals: 1\nBournemouth (2016-17) - loan\nAppearances: 10 Goals: 3\nProgress has been rapid since he made it into the Bournemouth team in November and Chelsea triggered a release clause at the start of last month.\nThat did not stop Eddie Howe trying to re-sign him on a permanent basis. Transfer chatter erupted when Ake was absent from the team-sheet at Liverpool on deadline day, even though he was at Anfield as part of the squad.\nHe had become a man in demand, catching the eye for reasons other than his dreadlocked mop and striking resemblance to Holland and AC Milan legend Ruud Gullit.\n'Everywhere I go people will say: 'Hey look, it's Gullit's son',' said Ake. 'Of course, he is a big character in Holland but not really a player I watched. I'm too young.\n'I've had my hair like this since I was about 12. First it was shorter and my dad used to do it for me every morning. Then it was my first tournament away in another country and he couldn't be there. And he made me dreads so I didn't have to do anything with it.'\nAke admits many people comment on his likeness to former Chelsea player Ruud Gullit\nThe defender met his compatriot and lookalike at the club's training ground on Thursday\nAke and Gullit met for the first time on Thursday when the former Chelsea player-manager visited the training ground to conduct an interview for a Dutch TV channel.\n'He said he'd been watching me and thought I'd done well and hopefully I can maybe make it into the national team as well,' said Ake, a Dutch Under 21 international.\n'There has been some interest from the Ivory Coast but I want to try and progress with Holland. It would be a dream to play for Holland. Hopefully they're watching.'\nAke was born in The Hague, starting out with ADO Den Haag, before moving to Feyenoord at the age of 12. Three years later, he agreed to join Chelsea after playing against them in the Willem II youth tournament.\n'It was a good tournament for me,' he said. 'We made it to the final and played against Chelsea and I scored, playing midfield, box-to-box. We lost on penalties.'\nHe was invited to the club with his family and met Didier Drogba.\n'He was training outside,' said Ake. 'We saw him and he came over to say hello. My Dad is a shy person but he was more shy than usual; a bit intimidated, I think. His family is from the Ivory Coast and Drogba is a big hero. Drogba just said: 'If you want to win trophies and be at a big club then join us'.'\nAke did just that but not because Drogba told him to. He has always been a young man with an independent mind.\n'I'm not really one for following other people,' he said. 'I never really had heroes. I play my own game. I like to take chances. This was what I wanted. I know it's not easy at a big club like this.'\nAke wants to progress with Holland, his country of birth, despite interest from the Ivory Coast\nPremier League title winner Didier Drogba urged Ake to join the Stamford Bridge club\nAke played against Chelsea at the age of 15 for Feyenoord in the Willem II youth tournament\nThere have been three loans spells: a brief one at Reading and a solid season at Watford playing regularly at left back. Then to Bournemouth where it started slowly.\n'The first two months were quite difficult because I wasn't playing,' said Ake. 'There was the mental side of coming through it. I could have said I wanted to come back and go somewhere else.\n'I'd gone there to play and was frustrated but I stayed to fight and wait for my chance. I was trying to work hard and be ready.'\nThe chance came at Stoke in November with Adam Smith suspended. Ake came in at centre half to score the game's only goal. Then he shone at Arsenal and scored a late winner against Liverpool.\n'I got confidence and the trust of the manager and everything was flowing,' said Ake.\n'Every game I was learning more, picking up little things, watching clips and talking to the manager. I felt as if I was growing into a better player.'\nAke made 10 appearances for Bournemouth, scoring three goals, at the start of the season\nThe defender finds the net against Liverpool as Bournemouth came from behind to win 4-3\nThere were calls from Eddie Newton and Paulo Ferreira — coaches responsible for Chelsea's loan players — and supportive messages from captain John Terry.\n'JT texted a couple of times after games when he'd watched on telly to say, 'Good game, well done, keep doing your work',' said Ake. 'It's nice, especially from a big character, a great player who has done everything in the game. It was good to know people were watching and I had that connection.'\nMore importantly, Conte was watching, too, and the Italian liked the look of the versatile left-sided defender. What's more, he would cost the club nothing more than the price of a call to the Canaries.\nNathan Ake is supporting Chelsea Soccer Schools this February half-term for players of all abilities in the south-east and promoting the Chelsea Foundation's values of fair play, respect and discipline.\nFor more information visit: www.chelseafc.com/soccerschools", "external_links": ["http://www.chelseafc.com/soccerschools"], "published": "2017-02-03T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T09:43:57.852+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
