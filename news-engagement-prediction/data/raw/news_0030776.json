But at a time when its rival Under Armour is getting slammed by its own sponsored athletes (including Steph Curry) for praising President Donald Trump, Nike's video could certainly be considered a political statement. \nJames appeared at Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign events and tweeted in support of the Women's March , so it's not hard to see where his politics lie. \n— LeBron James (@KingJames) January 21, 2017 \nEarlier this week, Reebok released a \"Nevertheless She Persisted\" T-shirt, a reference to Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren's silenced speech speech in opposition to Jeff Session's nomination as attorney general. \nIn Trump's America, where refugees and immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries were recently banned, it's going to be more difficult for voices in the sports world to stay inside the lines.
