If correct, this will be one of the clear areas of upgrade compared to the LG G5 which came packing a 2,800 mAh battery. While the official has not reportedly confirmed the exact capacity of the battery, it stands to reason that it will not likely be that much higher than the 3,200 mAh level, due to the wording of the quote being offered. \nThis is generally speaking, the extent to the current information coming out of this latest report with no further details provided. However, the LG G6 has not been short of leaks lately, with a majority of the most recent ones actually coming from teasers from LG itself. For instance, earlier today it was reported that the LG G6 will look to place a deal of its focus on its durability . At the moment it is unclear whether that durability will come in the form of better protection against water or just better protection against drops or bangs, although the consensus is that durability will be one of its selling points. \nAs will be the display, as previous teasers have suggested the LG G6 will make use of a “Full Vision” display which seems to largely be relevant to the amount of screen real estate that will be on offer with the LG G6. Other teasers that have come through have suggested the LG G6 will be ‘more intelligent’ than other smartphones, which has been assumed to mean that the smartphone will come with some form of AI assistant on board – with some suggestions being the inclusion of more than one assistant. Coming back to the battery briefly though, it has also been said in previous reports that the battery will be non-replaceable – unlike the LG G5. So if both rumors are correct, then while LG will be removing the ability to change the battery outright, they are planning to greatly increase the battery, compared to previous LG G series models.
