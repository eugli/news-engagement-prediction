(Carter Family) \nThe Carter family donated $1.25 million to Be The Match Foundation in honor of their son, Jason.  (Carter Family) \nPrevious Next A Minnesota family’s recent $1.25 million donation to the Be The Match Foundation will go toward building a better network for patients and families desperately searching for potentially life-saving clinical trials. Bob and Diana Carter, of Wayzata, Minnesota, recently made the donation to the Minneapolis-based nonprofit run by the National Marrow Donor Program in honor of their son, Jason Carter, who died in May 2016 after battling leukemia for more than four years.\nBob and Diana, both 62, were traveling back from Montana in February 2012 when then 24-year-old Jason called about a bad blood test. Jason had suspected he was suffering from symptoms of mononucleosis, but the test revealed it was actually acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).\n“He had the kid form, ALL, which is very treatable,” Diana, 62, told Fox News. “But he found out about a week later that he had a chromosome mutation which is very difficult to treat.”\nInitially, Jason underwent a month of intensive treatment involving chemotherapy and received a bone marrow transplant from an unrelated donor set up by Be The Match. His cancer went into remission, and for more than a year, he was able to return to traveling with friends and continue his studies.\nBut in January 2014, the cancer returned, and the Carters learned about the complex and difficult world of clinical trials. Bob had read about a treatment being explored at the University of Pennsylvania that targeted Jason’s mutation, but his doctors were unaware of it and directed the family to ClinicalTrials.Gov, the national database for trials and ongoing research across the country.\n“We started searching and trying to find some information that would work for Jason’s type of disease,” Diane said. “Then we talked to about five centers that were offering a program — we ended up going to visit the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda and Memorial Sloan Kettering [Cancer Center in New York].”\nMore on this...
