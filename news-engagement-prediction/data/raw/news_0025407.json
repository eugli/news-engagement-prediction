The dog, which killed 500 sheep in six years, was finally trapped on a property near Scone in New South Wales on Monday, the Singleton Argus reported. 'He was one horrible piece of work,' Hunter Local Land Services Senior Biosecurity Officer Richard Ali said. 'He was a big, strong, wild dog capable of getting the bigger sheep down and surgically removing their kidneys, only their kidneys and then letting them go and the sheep would run off and eventually bleed to death.' The wild dog, which had evaded hunters for six years, was shot dead on Monday Sheep which had been attacked by the 'Hannibal Lecter' dog The wild dog would rip the kidneys from sheep and leave them to die Mr Ali, who described the elusive dog as a 'Hannibal Lecter', said it was uncommon for dogs to attack sheep in that way and leave them to a slow and painful death. The wild dog had terrorised Norm Black's 2100 acre property 'Sofia Hill' since 2011. Mr Black said the dog made his life a 'living hell', killing 500 sheep worth about $50,000. 'He was so cunning and was always a loner never once did we see him with another dog,' Mr Black said.
