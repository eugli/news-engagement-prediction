Kasten on Dodgers' offseason Kasten excited that Dodgers retain Jansen, Turner Dodgers president and CEO Stan Kasten discusses bringing back free agents Kenley Jansen and Justin Turner \nUtility (2): Van Slyke, Chase Utley (pending). However, Kik√©Hernandez , Chris Taylor and (if healthy) Thompson are all in the mix. All but Utley bat right-handed. \nOutfield (5): Joc Pederson , Yasiel Puig , Andrew Toles , Ethier, Franklin Gutierrez (pending). Pederson starts in center against righties and everything else is to be decided. Management loves Toles, while Puig is at a career crossroads. Ethier comes off a broken leg, but he's a gamer. Gutierrez joins Thompson and Van Slyke as specialists against lefties when they are healthy. \nStarting pitchers (5): Clayton Kershaw , Rich Hill , Kenta Maeda , Kazmir, McCarthy The first three are givens. Julio Urias will be the fourth, but maybe not until May as his innings are rationed. Kazmir and McCarthy (with guaranteed contracts) return from injuries and probably get first shots, but Wood, Brock Stewart and Ross Stripling are viable. Initial reports on Ryu are favorable, but he's been shelved for two years. Gurnick on Dodgers star Kershaw Gurnick dicusses Dodgers star for 2017 Kershaw MLB.com Dodgers reporter Ken Gurnick names Clayton Kershaw as the Dodgers star for the 2017 season \nBullpen (7): Kenley Jansen , Romo (pending), Pedro Baez , Grant Dayton , Liberatore, Josh Fields , Josh Ravin Not included initially are Hatcher and Wood, but the former is out of options and the latter could be a starter or reliever. Lefties Luis Avilan and Vidal Nuno have legit shots, as does non-roster invitee Brandon Morrow -- if he's healthy. Ken Gurnick has covered the Dodgers since 1989, and for MLB.com since 2001.
