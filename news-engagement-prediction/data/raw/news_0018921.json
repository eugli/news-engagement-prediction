The mission will be accomplished,\" General Villas Boas, Brazil's army commander, said via Twitter o n Thursday. Wave of muggings \nBrazil's Globo television network quoted the police union in Espirito Santo saying that more than 100 people have now been killed in a wave of muggings, carjackings and looting in the capital city Vitoria and elsewhere. \nRelatives and sympathisers of striking officers are blockading police stations, and officers inside are deliberately making no effort to come out - leaving the city unguarded. \nThe website of the Colnago's office said talks had been held with the police but with no result. \nIt also issued an appeal on Thursday for blood donors, saying stocks \"have been reduced to a minimum in the last few days\". 1,200 troops are struggling to fill the security vacuum in the state [EPA] \nThe police want better conditions and higher salaries. A court declared the action an illegal strike and the state police chief has been replaced. \nMeanwhile, there were continuing fears and rumours in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's second most populous city, that police could start a copycat strike on Friday. \nOfficials have said they are working on paying officers late salaries and that no strike is planned. However, persistent rumors on social media have struck a nerve. \nState Governor Luis Fernando Pezao told Radio Gaucha in an interview early Thursday that he had asked the federal authorities to put the army and elite National Force on standby in case the situation deteriorates, Globo television reported. \nOPINION: The fight for Brazil's future \nRio has recently faced violent protests against austerity reforms, stretching police resources. \nThe crisis reflects nationwide budget crises in Brazil blamed on corruption, which has faced a crippling recession for two years and is struggling to return to growth.The country is also one of the most violent in the world, with heavily armed criminals battling both on the streets and in prisons. \nLast month clashes inside a prison near the northern city of Natal left 26 people dead, prompting the deployment of army troops.
