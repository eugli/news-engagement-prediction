British media reported the cause as heart failure.\nOn “Games of Thrones,” the fearsome Mag was a giant on the northern side of the great ice wall that was guarded by Lord Commander Jon Snow and the black-clad men of the Night’s Watch.\nFingleton was recognized by Guinness World Records in 2007 as the U.K.’s tallest man.\nNeil Fingleton, seen in this Nov. 4, 2013, photo, has died at 36. Geoff Caddick/PA via AP\nBorn in northeast England in 1980, Fingleton told the Guinness records website in 2006, “I have always been taller than everyone since I can remember.”\nHis height made him a basketball natural, and Fingleton played college basketball in the United States for the University of North Carolina and the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts. He went on to a short professional basketball career in the U.S. and Europe before turning to acting.\nBeside “Game of Thrones,” he appeared in films including “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” “47 Ronin and “X-Men: First Class” and in TV shows including “Doctor Who.”\nIan Whyte, who played another giant on “Game of Thrones,” offered his condolences on Twitter, saying: “Very sad to hear of the tragic passing of Neil Fingleton. He followed his dreams.”\nNeil Fingleton scores on a slam dunk during the McDonald’s High School All-American game at the Fleet Center in Boston. | Getty Images file photo\n# game-of-thrones Neil Fingleton", "external_links": ["https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/636237297557460708-72482263.jpg?w=400&h=300", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/92dixd3hsn3xzmi13rwy.jpg?w=174&#038;h=300", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/636237297557460708-72482263.jpg", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/92dixd3hsn3xzmi13rwy.jpg?w=87&h=150", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/636237297557460708-72482263.jpg?w=150&h=113", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/92dixd3hsn3xzmi13rwy.jpg?w=594", "http://wp.me/p7fJAs-2710", "https://twitter.com/Ian_Whyte/status/835782291800616960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/92dixd3hsn3xzmi13rwy.jpg?w=348&h=600", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/92dixd3hsn3xzmi13rwy.jpg?w=174&h=300", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/92dixd3hsn3xzmi13rwy.jpg", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/636237297557460708-72482263.jpg?w=400&#038;h=300", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/636237297557460708-72482263.jpg?w=540"], "published": "2017-02-27T17:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:16:00.106+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
