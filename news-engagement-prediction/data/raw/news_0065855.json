By Marc Parent Wednesday, February 22, 2017, 8:10 am Cun Shi \nThere are worse things that can happen to your child than Osgood-Schlatter disease, but if it’s the only worst thing that’s ever happened, it’s pretty bad. In this condition, which usually develops in athletic children as the result of a sustained growth spurt, the quadriceps pull on the tendon attaching the kneecap to the tibia, causing the tendon to pull away, and producing pain that can last many months. In severe cases, the tendon can separate from the shinbone, requiring surgery for reattachment. The X-rays of my son’s right knee revealed his tendon had begun to do just that. \n“I don’t want to be that guy,” the orthopedic surgeon, Fred Barnes, said to Willem, who sat restlessly on the edge of a paper-covered exam table. “That guy who says you shouldn’t play any sports this year. But I have to be that guy.” Willem glanced at me. He was a four-sport sixth-grader who had constructed his entire identity around physical activity. Advertisement \nQuote of the Day, motivation, and inspiration — every morning rundown \nAdvice on training, nutrition, shoes, and more — every evening Keep this field blank \nPrivacy Policy | About Us \n“All sports?” I asked Dr. Barnes. He closed his eyes and nodded. Then he explained the perils of surgery and how close Willem was to needing it. “Can he run?” I asked. \n“Even if I said yes, I don’t think he’d be able to,” he said, which was true in the end. After dropping out of his teams, he made a last-ditch attempt to stay active with a commitment to maintain a slow mile, but quickly had to give that up as well. For the rest of the year and most of the next, he had difficulty just walking up stairs. \nI’m not sure what it is about watching your kid go through a protracted battle with a disease and come out better on the other end that makes you want to go to Disney. Of course there are less dramatic, happier reasons that might make you want to go there—you could celebrate a graduation or a report card or you could just eat a banana and say, “That’s it—we’re going to Disney World!” But if like me, you’re not a Disney person—if you’ve celebrated graduations and good report cards and eaten dozens of bananas and still not heard the Disney alarm bell, a recovery from a long childhood illness really makes it ring. I had never taken any of our kids to Disney World, but the afternoon I saw Willem walk across the field after a difficult game without limping, I suddenly wanted to put a stake into the heart of the long struggle he’d endured with the ultimate celebration. What better way to celebrate health than with a race, and what better place to hold that celebration than Disney World? \nThis year, runDisney will hold nine themed events with courses ranging from 5K to 26.2 “magical miles,” taking runners past the most iconic landmarks of its California, Florida, and Paris theme parks. The half marathons and marathons usually start before the parks open, allowing runners unfettered passage through the lit-up spectacle of inarguably some of the world’s ultimate playgrounds. If you ever wanted to stand in sweat-soaked awe beneath the giant, hovering, violet and green-lit Spaceship Earth at Epcot, if you ever wanted to glide through the glittering castle gates of the Magic Kingdom with little more than the sound of your feet striking the cobblestones, there is a Disney race for you. If you want to run in a princess dress, a Chewbacca costume, or classic white puffy gloves and mouse ears, there is a Disney race for you. If you want to run and take a selfie with Tinker Bell or the Avengers, C-3PO, Jabba the Hutt, Cinderella, Merida, Ariel, Dopey, Goofy, Donald Duck, or the relentlessly cheerful Mickey Mouse himself, Disney has a race for you. In 2015, more than 250,000 runners ate the banana, heard the alarm, and answered the call. \nWhen I told Willem I wanted to run with him through Disney World, he didn’t jump at it—a reaction that was either a parental triumph or failure. \n“I have school,” he said. \n“It’s on a weekend. You’ll only miss a day. Let’s do it.” \n“Why?” \n“Because your knees don’t hurt anymore. Because you’re finally healthy again and healthy people run and we should celebrate that. Because you were resilient and patient and never complained and sometimes when people want to celebrate a difficult accomplishment that was a long time coming, they go to Disney World.” \n“Resilient.” He raised an eyebrow. \n“Yeah, a little slack, please. Dads acknowledge resilience.” \nI signed us up for the inaugural Star Wars Half Marathon—The Dark Side weekend last April, where we would run the 10K race, a distance cleared by Dr. Barnes. After catching up on our Star Wars movies and two months of easy running, we landed in Orlando and less than an hour later, were shaking the big, white-gloved Mickey hand of a doorman for Disney’s Coronado Springs Resort, who somehow knew our names without us telling him. So the magic began. \nRUNNER’S WORLD VIP: Run with us at the 2018 Walt Disney World Dopey Challenge \nWe made a quick visit to the Health and Fitness Race Expo at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex to sign waivers and pick up race packets. Within moments of stepping onto the grounds, we were met head-on by a marching formation of Stormtroopers, which was, you know, fantastic. It probably goes without saying, but these were not merely people dressed as Stormtroopers—they were actual Stormtroopers, from glossy full-body shine to blasters. “Real Storm-troopers!” I said to Will as they crossed us. \n“No way, where?” he said, and I pushed him from his stride. Cun Shi \nI had been told there was a certain polish to all things Disney, and the race expo was early proof of that. The cavernous arena with rows of exhibitors offering everything but fitness itself was like what you might expect to find in a heaven that favored runners. The well-stocked merchandise section was walled off by giant panels covered with Star Wars artwork that, like nearly everything else, produced anxiety if you passed them without taking a picture. Overwhelmed by the desire for everything, we left with nothing, save for a few Mini Clif bars. \nIn the remaining hours of the day, we made a brief visit to the Animal Kingdom Theme Park, where we approached the massive Tree of Life and began our amazement at the scale of everything—in this case, the “tree trunk” carved with so many animals it would take a day to see them all. There is a built-in, reliable thrill you get from standing in front of something you’ve seen a hundred times in photographs, and a similarly reliable charge in bringing your child with you to do so. At Disney, the effect is magnified to a level that causes a sort of recklessness. “We’re really here!” I said to Willem, indulging the feeling that every past and future childhood deficit was made moot by our presence at the base of this towering plastic tree. \nAfter hitting the major attractions of the park and eating a light dinner, we bussed back to the hotel and returned to the room, where our turned-down beds were decorated with hand towels elaborately folded into various Disney characters, including Mickey. Said Willem: “He’s everywhere.” \nWe woke to our alarms at 3:30 a.m., showered, pinned on numbers, ate the Mini Clif bars with half-watered Gatorade, and stepped out into the night with hundreds of other sleepy racers. \nThe 10K staging area in front of Epcot was a colorful blaze of arcing lights and chrome scaffolding stretching past six starting corrals and more than 12,000 runners. Enormous outdoor screens projected classic Star Wars scenes as the thunder of music and lightsabers and blasters and TIE Fighters seemed to rise straight from the ground. \nAn adjacent lot was filled with hundreds of runners waiting in small lines to get snapshots with Star Wars characters—each scene staged and lit as if ripped straight from the movies. I dragged Willem over to my hero (and the shortest line): the fat, drooling, hookah-smoking Jabba the Hutt and his nasty little monkey-lizard pet. When it was our turn, we stepped into the scene and tried not to have a Star Wars meltdown like the ones we’d seen trembling runners have in the adjacent Darth Maul scene. \nWith a half hour before the start of the race, Willem and I jogged through the happy mayhem to our assigned corral. No sooner had we oriented ourselves than a bright rash of fireworks burst from the arch of the starting gate and the first corral of runners howled with arms raised and took off. We moved forward to the base of an elevated stage where Jedi reenactors battled with noisy, flashing lightsabers. Most of the people around us were dressed as Star Wars characters. I had thought about getting outfits for us and if I ever did this again, I would. You don’t get any seriousness points for running a Star Wars race at Disney just because you’re not in Wookiee boots. The onstage Jedi twirled and crashed their lightsabers furiously and the crowd around us cheered. Then the big screens pulsed with a starry countdown and another rash of overhead sparks released us onto the course. \nFrom the moment it began, the race was a kind of reverse parade, where instead of sitting stationary on a curb as the floats and dancers pass down the middle of the street, you run down the middle of the street as the stationary floats and dancers greet you from the curb. First came the marching band, probably a hundred strong, blaring the original Star Wars theme. Under a night sky, the song, with its up-beat drums and smashing cymbals, rivaled the Rocky theme as an adrenaline pumper. Then came the asteroid field—a projection of some sort that blended seamlessly with the darkness and seemed to engulf us with giant spinning boulders. Cun Shi \nWe rounded a corner at the half mile and rushed straight for the Spaceship Earth at Epcot. We watched it grow large with our approach, filling the sky with colorful shimmering light, then we swung into Epcot and made our way over the charming paths and walkways surrounding the World Showcase, passing the Canada and United Kingdom pavilions—two of the 11 countries elaborately re-created along the loop. \nCrossing a wide bridge, we charged down another causeway along the rim of a smaller lagoon, then straight through the grand entrance of the Hollywood Studios park, which was fully lit and twinkling as if on the busiest holiday weekend. Up ahead, there was a large crowd of runners. We slowed as we approached and bumped fists with every human and nonhuman Star Wars character you can think of and many you couldn’t. Huge crowds formed around Darth Vader, who posed stoically for pictures, and C-3PO, who paced and waved and flashed his yellow eyes. I wanted to loop back, as many runners were, to get a second look at everyone, but Willem tore ahead. \n“How are the knees?” I asked when I caught up to him. He said they were good and asked if we could run a little faster. Despite the digital clocks at every mile marker and the ChronoTrack B-tags attached to our race bibs, I told him our finishing time wasn’t really the point. I offered to sign him up for a 10K back home if he really wanted to see how fast he could go. As if on cue, R2-D2 appeared around the corner, and we detoured from the course and stopped for a closer look. We ran up Sunset Boulevard, stopped again to pose for a course photographer, under the looming shadow of the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, then exited the park on our way to complete the second half of the race. \nJust after the four-and-a-half-mile water stop, we entered a long straightaway that began new mileage for Willem. In our training, I had never taken him past mile five. He asked if he could speed ahead and wait for me at the entrance of the final park. I nodded and he took off down a long line of belching fog machines and low green lights. In the weird and beautiful mash-up of an artificially manufactured landscape populated with hooting, costumed runners, thumping movie music, fictional interplanetary battles, and my own exhaustion, I gave in to a wave of genuine emotion. Willem flew ahead with giant leaping strides—strong and loose and fast as bands of green fog swirled in his wake. Given how different that stride was from the hobbling shuffle he’d had for so long, it would have been moving to watch him run as effortlessly down a simple sidewalk, but add green fog and interstellar orchestral music to the mix and, well, a group of jogging mailmen would draw tears. \nWhen you visit Disney as a first-timer, friends who have been before you raise great expectations about the importance and inevitability of the “Disney moment”—that speck of time that freezes in memory as a happy spot you can return to when you’re back in life and ever needing a lift. There was a medal at the end of the race I was looking forward to that might qualify for that moment, and a promising load of rides and sights in the days to follow, but when I saw Willem run ahead of me and glance back, smiling, I knew I’d experienced the promised Disney moment. \nWe met up again at the entrance to the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex and plowed through the remainder of the course. As a testament to the number of run-stopping sights we’d enjoyed, we crossed the finish line together for a net time of 1:11:16. Under a hail of music and lights and cheering spectators, we cupped each other’s shoulders in an eighth-grade boy’s version of a hug. Then we ducked into fancy TIE Fighter medals and made our way to a large finishers’ area where we ate postrace snacks and posed for pictures with the BB-8 droid, a giant lamprey monster, and two Stormtroopers—real ones. \nJust before heading back to our room, we spotted Darth Vader standing in a blue spaceship. Willem was “okay with not actually meeting him.” \n“We have to,” I said. “I think you have to pay a fine of some sort if you complete this race and skip out on Darth Vader.” We stepped forward. Cun Shi \n“You—over here,” Darth Vader said, jabbing his finger at me and pointing to his right, the lights on his belt and vest blinking, the deep, commanding voice indistinguishable from that in the movies. He turned to Willem and stared motionless at him, breathing his signature, aqua-lung rasp. Suddenly, he opened his folded arms and let them hover at his sides. Willem didn’t flinch but I could tell he was in a way melting. Vader leaned in slightly as if to look at him more closely. The moment seemed to last much longer than it probably did. Slowly, he turned his head and Willem followed along, taking the place to his left side. Then he folded his arms in front of him again and turned to me and said, “The Force is strong with this one.” \nI held up my medal and smiled for the picture, thinking: That. Just. Happened. If there is such a thing as a runDisney moment, we’d both just had one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T15:35:40.937+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
