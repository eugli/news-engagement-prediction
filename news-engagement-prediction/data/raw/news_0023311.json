Is Trump's immigration order legal? Who does travel ban affect? Why did an Iraq veteran give a stranger his Purple Heart medal? Lancaster, Pennsylvania: America's refugee capital A federal judge temporarily blocked Donald Trump's order last week.\nAs a result, people from seven countries - Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen - with valid visas were able to travel to the US again.\nWashington state, Minnesota and other states want the appeals court to permit the temporary restraining order to stand as their lawsuit works its way through the courts.\nA 15-page brief issued by the Justice Department on Monday night argued the executive order was a \"lawful exercise of the president's authority\" and not a ban on Muslims.", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38781302"], "published": "2017-02-08T03:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:07:37.313+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
