Officials who refuse to enforce immigration laws should be defunded, fined, and criminally prosecuted. It is time for Texas to take a stand. It is time for Texas to ban sanctuary cities,” said Governor Abbott. \nIn his speech the governor acknowledged the protesters outside. \nThe governor then recognized those in the audience who had served in the military for preserving the freedom to protest public officials. \n(©2017 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.
