A flight from Germany to Afghanistan in December 2016, when the current phase of the repatriation initiative began, had 16 of 50 passengers disappear. \n\"We sent home 80,000 last year whose asylum applications were rejected – that's a record… And the number will rise again further,” Peter Altmaier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel's chief of staff told Bild in an interview. \n“There were some 700,000 asylum applications in 2016 and nearly 300,000 were rejected. We'll be sending these people home quickly, because if we don't, it'll damage our credibility as a state based on the rule of law,\" he added. \nThere is still strong support for refugees to remain in the country, as evidenced by the 300 protesters at Munich airport on Wednesday. \nREAD MORE: If Afghanistan collapses, 4mn more refugees will flood into Europe – Fallon \nIn addition, the German state of Schleswig-Holstein will not be deporting any refugees to Afghanistan until May 31, at the earliest. This bold move further highlights the complexity of the refugee crisis in Germany as national and state authorities clash on an ongoing basis. \n\"The security situation in Afghanistan may vary from region to region, but one cannot say that the situation anywhere in the country is particularly good,\" Bärbel Kofler, the Bundestag's human rights commissioner told the German Passauer Neue Presse newspaper, as reported by DW .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T04:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T00:41:12.343+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
