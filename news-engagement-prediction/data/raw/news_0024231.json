But we don’t even have the records of those who fought and sacrificed to free their motherland, India from imperial rule,” he told Hindustan Times. \nThe ruling BJP’s ideological mentor, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh describe the concept of Akhand Bharat as a unified India which includes Pakistan and Bangladesh. While the BJP leadership wavers on the issue, the RSS has remained a strong proponent of the idea. Read more RSS backs talks with Pak but its Mahabharta analogy is unhelpful \nTripathi, who has raised the issue in Parliament as well, wants the Centre to construct a new memorial ‘Shahid Gate’ adjacent to India Gate in the national capital. \nThe enormity of exercise, which would include ferreting out names of those who participated in the freedom struggle, starting with the soldiers’ rebellion of 1857, from places, now in Pakistan and Bangladesh does not daunt Tripathi. \n“It is not difficult to collect information if the government gets down to it. For years successive governments had failed to honour heroes such as Bhagat Singh and Rajguru. Modiji (PM Narendra Modi) was the first Prime Minister to visit the birthplace Chandrashekhar Azad (in Madhya Pradesh),” the MP from the eastern UP constituency, named after the poet-saint Kabir, said.
