In his opinion the current situation would not have resulted under a democratic system. \nThe professor also called for a social culture to support democracy. \nThe professor said such a culture would shore up institutions and ensure peaceful transitions of power. \n“We have to build up a strong democratic mentality,” he said. “We need to prepare. We need to begin practising democracy and slowly make it stronger.” \nDuring the event Professor David Hume of Manchester University praised Bangladesh for its climate change alleviation efforts. \nThe work had turned Bangladesh into an international ‘role model’, he said. \nClimate change alleviation is a major challenge, he said and added that Bangladesh must do more to alleviate the damage from flash floods, storm surges and other natural disasters. \nThe conference was led by SANEM Chairman Dr Bajlul Haque Khandker and also featured a speech by Dhaka University Professor Dr Selim Raihan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T23:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T12:10:41.183+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
