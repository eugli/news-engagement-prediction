The Dallas Cowboys lost 34-31. (Jae S. Lee/The   \nHow about coming in to a situation like playing behind the Cowboys' offensive line? \nPrescott: It was beautiful. Those are five guys up front that I wouldn't trade any day of the week. I'm so thankful for them. This was the first time I've finished a season feeling as great as I've felt, and it's just a credit to them - their work. They're not guys that want to be known, but they're going to come each and every day and work hard. \nHow much did they help you? \nPrescott: So much. Travis Frederick - he's the genius. He's up front. He's got all the checks. He's got everything that I'm thinking. \nI get up to the line, maybe I'm teeter-tottering on this check or that check - which one is it? 'Hey Trav, are we good?' Trav says, 'Yeah, we're good' or 'Nah, nah, kill it' or   \nSo, just having a veteran like that just allows me to feel that much more comfortable - I know the checks already, but if it's ever a situation where it's 50-50, I know I've got a guy right there I can just kind of whisper to and he's going to put me in the right situation.   \nIs there a part of who that plays with a chip on your shoulder due to so many QBs being drafted ahead of you? \nPrescott: Yeah, always. I think that's the type of guy I am. That's the guy I've been my whole life is the guy that's been doubted, guy that people told I wouldn't do this, I wouldn't do that, and that's just allowed the chip on my shoulder to grow. Especially this year, 134 guys picked before me, seven other quarterbacks, I'm going to prove to you and I'm going to show you what I'm worth ... It was a long wait, trust me. \nWhat he wants to be even better at in Year 2... \nPrescott: Every aspect of the game. I think that's the only way I can get better. Be an overall better quarterback mentally, physically - just getting away from the center. Taking snaps from under the center. I know that was a big doubt of mine, or whatever, coming into the NFL not having many snaps under center in college or high school ... \n... I spent some time with Drew Brees at the Pro Bowl. You just watch a guy like that explode away from center, feet always in position, and it motivates you. I want to get like that. I want to be like that. I want to be like Matt Ryan under center who's getting back five steps, seven steps, and making all the throws and it looks no different from when they're in the gun. So, I think that's one of the biggest things I'll work on this offseason.
