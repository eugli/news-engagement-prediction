Review finds 'polite parents' breaching security \n\"[That incident] prompted us to look at our own security measures and we brought a security firm in from outside to review everything,\" Mr Thomson told ABC Radio Perth . \nThe centre already had entry-coded gates and had recently added CCTV cameras to all entrances, but he said the security review also recommended parents wear photo identification to pick-up and drop-off their children. \nThe review found many parents were holding the gates open for each other. \n\"Parents are polite and they do let in other people but they may not know who those people are,\" he said. \n\"I'm a middle-aged man, I'm one of the owners of the business, but a lot of parents won't know me but they still hold the gate open for me.\" \n\"Our centres are quite large; there might be 150 parents walking through the gate every day and there can be no expectation that every parent knows every other parent. \n\"Really the only way to deal with that is put identification on everyone.\" \nMr Thomson said most parents had accepted the need to wear the centre's photo ID tags. Overkill or necessary inconvenience? \nSome listeners to ABC Radio Perth said the measure was taking security measures too far. \nStephanie: \"It's overkill because there are times that the primary carers do give permission for a friend or relative to pick up the children.\" \nDwain: \"I am a day care operator. I would not expect that any normal day care operator would embrace photo ID to be worn by parents as we try to make day care more homely ... the most essential part of day care security is that the staff know each of the parents or carers personally. Photo ID isn't needed if the centre staff are doing their job and forming relationships.\" \nOthers were more supportive. \nJasmine: \"I can understand how this is a minefield for childcare centres. While it might be a little inconvenient for me, ultimately the safety of the kids has to come first, and however a centre chooses to manage these situations needs to be supported.\" \nTracey: \"It's polite to hold doors open to people and it happens often that a parent will let in others out of politeness, not knowing if they are another parent whose child is attending the centre.\" Custody battles an increasing challenge \nMr Thomson said the photo ID tags would also help staff manage situations where a child is the subject of a custody dispute between parents. \nParents who attempt to subvert custody arrangements by picking children up from child care are a regular challenge for the centres. \n\"It's becoming increasingly prevalent and court orders can be difficult to enforce â€” we unfortunately become the enforcers in those circumstances,\" Mr Thomson said. \n\"I think the ID tag is going to assist in the process.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T11:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T06:57:50.396+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
