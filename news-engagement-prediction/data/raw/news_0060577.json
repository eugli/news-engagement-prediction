'Ka' (in Hindi) is for Congress, 'Sa' for Samajwadi Party and 'Ba' for BSP,\" Shah had said in Chauri Chaura, a historic town in Uttar Pradesh. \n\nKasab, the only terrorist caught after the 2008 Mumbai terror attack by Pakistani attackers, was hanged in 2012. \n\n\"Until Kasab is laid to rest, development and prosperity will continue to elude UP,\" Shah had said. \n\nMayawati earlier took on Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he used another acronym to describe the three parties. \"SCAM is Samajwadi, Congress, Akhilesh and Mayawati,\" he had said at his first rally in Uttar Pradesh. \n\nThis week, Modi had described the BSP as \"Behenji Sampatti (property) Party\". \n\nIn her riposte, Mayawati called the BJP \"Bharatiya Jumla (rhetoric) Party\" and used PM Modi's initials to call him \"Mr Negative Dalit Man.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T15:34:05.355+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
