Exports of grapes soared 50% to around 2.3 billion yen and those of strawberries jumped 35% to roughly 1.1 billion yen. Fruit House Yano, a grape grower in Yamanashi Prefecture, does business with luxury hotels and began exports to Malaysia in fiscal 2015. \nThe growing popularity of Japanese cuisine served as a tailwind. Green tea exports rose 14% to 11.6 billion yen. Beef shipments grew 23% to 13.5 billion yen, with exports to Hong Kong surging 33% thanks to robust demand among affluent consumers who favor high-grade wagyu beef. \nRice exports hit 2.3 billion yen in the January-November period, already surpassing an annual record reached in 2015. \"Exports are rising, as Japanese food becomes more widespread,\" according to an executive at a major rice wholesaler. \nMeanwhile, poor catches of scallops and bonito weighed on exports of fishery products. \nThe government aims to lift Japan's agricultural exports to 1 trillion yen in 2019, a target that looks difficult to meet at the current pace. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe counted on the Trans-Pacific Partnership on this front, but U.S. President Donald Trump recently announced his country's withdrawal from the trade pact. \n(Nikkei)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T13:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:46:54.377+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
