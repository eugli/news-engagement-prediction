By Zee Media Bureau | Last Updated: Saturday, February 25, 2017 - 10:08 0 Follow @ZeeNewsSports \nNew Delhi: South African ODI skipper AB de Villiers etched his name into record books by becoming the fastest batsman to claim 9000 ODI runs (205 innings), surpassing former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly, who did so in 228 innings. \nDe Villiers reached the landmark with a glorious four on the bowling of Lockie Ferguson during South Africa's third ODI against New Zealand in Wellington on Saturday, February 25th. \nSooner or later, the stylish right-hander was destined to achieve the record. He began the New Zealand tour with just 87 short of 9000 runs. He scored 37-not out and 45, respectively in the previous two matches and finally made the record his own in the third. \nIn total there are 18 batsmen in the '9000 Club' in One-day Internationals and De Villiers boasts the best strike-rate of them all with an incredible 99.94. \nAB achieved the feat in terms of matches or innings taken, but as far as time taken from ODI debut is concerned, he isn't one of the quickests. That record belongs to another Indian, Rahul Dravid, who reached the mark in 9 years and 322 days from his debut. What makes 'The Wall's record more special is that he is till date the only player to have achieved the feat inside a decade. \nHere's the list of top 10 fastest batsmen to have achieved the feat:- No. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T07:24:47.922+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
