For many, just watching the movies that make up DC&apos;s Extended Universe has people not wanting to deal with their product. Judging by the latest rumor about Ben Affleck&apos;s much-discussed solo Batman flick  The Batman , it sounds like  being in  the movies has soured Affleck on their product.\nRelated 'Cloverfield' Director Reportedly Offered 'Batman' Franchise Ben Affleck Says He's Not Directing 'The Batman,' Surprising Nobody Ben Affleck Refuses to Play Batman Again If the Script Is 'Not Good Enough' For those who are unaware,  The Batman  has been in the news off and on for a number of reasons. Last summer, Affleck was the one who tweeted out Deathstroke footage that turned into Joe Managaniello officially joining DC&apos;s Extended Universe as Deathstroke, who would be the villain in the next Batman movie. That following October, Affleck announced that this film,  The Batman , was something that he&apos;d write, produce, and obviously star in. By the end of 2016, although the rumored plan was to start shooting The Batman  in the Spring of 2017 , Affleck told  EW  that he was working on the \"sub par\" script for  The Batman , indicating that he was \"not going to write and direct anything that I don’t think is good enough to be made.\"\n\nAt the top of 2017, Affleck warned fans that he might end up stepping down from directing  The Batman , which became a reality after Matt Reeves, who directed 2008&apos;s  Cloverfield , was reportedly offered the role.\nWhy do we bring up all of that? Primarily to say that this movie has felt like it was plagued early on.\nThe latest rumor about Affleck and  The Batman  comes to us from our friends over at Collider via their  Collider Heroes  show . Host John Compea dropped a scoop that, judging by the above timeline regarding Batfleck and  The Batman , sounds about right. Emphasis is our own.\n\" Take this for what it’s worth. This is from a guy who has been burned twice by scoops, so please take this with a massive, massive grain of salt. Over the past four days, I’ve talked to three separate people, who are connected in some way, to what is going on over at Warner Bros. What all three have told me, nothing about whether the script was thrown out or whether they liked the script, nothing about the direction that Matt Reeves is taking it in, nothing about that. What has come out of the conversation with all three was this. They’re telling me that, Ben Affleck, make no mistake, he does want out. He doesn’t want to be Batman anymore. I have been told that Affleck is talking with Warner Bros. in an attempt to get out of being Batman. If they do not let him out of being Batman, that the stand alone Batman film that ultimately happens, will be the last time we see Affleck as Batman, because he apparently wants out.\"\nWhat could possibly push Affleck to hang up the horns? It could be due to the panning that each of the DC films has been given by everyone who isn&apos;t a diehard DC fan. Maybe Affleck&apos;s the only one who wants to hop off the proverbial sinking ship before he gets in too deep? Maybe the rumblings about bad scripts and whatnot was too much for him?\nThe problem with rumors like this, though, are that he&apos;s already been Batman in a few flicks, and he&apos;s reprising the role for November&apos;s  Justice League  movie. Maybe he doesn&apos;t give a f*ck, but it feels weird to have him jump in to help usher this new phase of the DC Extended Universe only to dip out. That&apos;d be a  major  blow to the franchise he&apos;s helped build (and put star power behind), but maybe he feels it&apos;s time to cut his losses?\nAgain, this should be taken with a grain of salt, but it  is  interesting.\nTags: News , Batman , Ben Affleck , DC Comics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T21:55:56.098+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
