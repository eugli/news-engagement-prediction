But it’s about to get a whole lot harder. Nick Whigham news.com.au @NWWHIGHAM \nJARED lives with his partner and her two children in the remote town of Moonta on the Yorke Peninsula of South Australia. \nThe 28-year-old hasn’t had a traditional job for more than four years but supports his family in a very unconventional way. He is a fulltime online poker player. \nBut his livelihood is about to disappear as the part of an overhaul of Australia’s $20 billion online wagering sector. \nOne of the changes to online gambling laws tabled in Parliament this week will effectively prohibit poker sites based outside of Australia to continue offering services to Australian players. \n“It’s going to be leaving people that use poker to feed their families, pay their bills, and general living expenses, well, they’re just not going to have that option anymore,” Jared said. \nLike many others in the fulltime poker community, Jared (who wanted his last name withheld) lives in a rural area and doesn’t have access to a casino and he is worried about the future. \n“I’ve been out of the workforce for four to five years now. What do people put on their resumé? \n“A lot of people are going to be left without any other choice but to re-enter the job market. It’s going to be like starting your life again.” \nWithout any solid working background, Jared in unsure about what sort of employment he will be able to find. \n“I’ll have to start at the bottom,” he said. “I didn’t have a very good life before I started playing poker, I didn’t really have too much direction. Poker actually gave me something to work towards,” he said. \nWhile some of the top guys will make six figures in a given year, Jared is a “mid-stakes” player and expects to make anywhere between $30,000 and $60,000 a per annum playing online tournaments. \nA GAME OF SKILL ... AND STIGMA \nPoker advocates are calling on the government to change the legislation to allow for player-to-player skill-based games, such as poker. \nFor serious fulltime players this is not a game of chance. They use a raft of tactics, techniques and mathematical reasoning to give them the best chance of winning. \nSome players keep tabs on opponents they regularly come across on high-stakes tables and keep logs on their style of play and tendencies. Others crunch data of every hand played at the table. \nDespite the skills involved, players know there is a stigma attached to the way they earn a crust. \n“When you tell people that you rely on poker for a living, it’s not that they find it confronting, but they don’t really know how to deal with it,” Jared said. “They just see it as gambling.” Poker Stars said it will no longer let Australian players join cash tables. Source: Supplied \nOPENING THE DOOR FOR DODGY PROVIDERS \nThe poker community argues that the only sites that will continue to offer cash tables to Australians will be the smaller and less trustworthy websites that are happy to flout regulations. \nThe changes will force offshore wagering companies to gain a license with the Australian government but given the broad wording of the bill, poker would likely be interpreted as a prohibited game making it tough to get a license. \nBecause the Australian player pool is relatively small, many players believe the big (and trustworthy) operators will not bother to re-enter the market by going through the regulatory hoops. \nPopular poker site 888poker has already pulled up stumps and Poker Stars has confirmed to news.com.au that it will follow suit. \n“If proposed legislation passes into law players located in Australia would likely be blocked from playing on our sites,” the company said. \nThe ones that do stick around could be bad news. \nSydneysider Grant Baker* has supported himself, very handsomely, for the past eight years by playing full time online poker. But along the way he has fallen victim to dodgy operators. \nHe says that after depositing a few thousand dollars on one site in early 2013 he began winning easily. The website was known for being ‘soft’, meaning there was a lot of bad players on there throwing money around loosely, he said. But looking back it could have been the owners of the site deliberately losing to draw players into the site. \nSoon after the site stopped paying players out. \n“(About) five to six months later their cashouts suddenly stopped being sent. Their support staff would lie and use delaying techniques, blaming the cashout delay on third party processors,” he said. \nIt’s believed in total, the company fled with up to $US15 million in player funds. Grant says he was owed $US40,000 and never saw a cent. \nAfter having his first child last year, he too is frustrated by the prospect of losing access to the reliable online poker companies. \n“It leaves Australians who want to play poker online with much riskier options ... whose corporate structures are deliberately hidden and registered in tax havens,” he said. Minister for Human Services, Alan Tudge has been leading the changes to online gambling. Picture: Aaron Francis Source: News Corp Australia \nHuman Services Minister Alan Tudge has spearheaded the changes to the wagering sector. \nMr Tudge has not responded to requests for comment on the bill’s intended impact on poker sites, but in the past has said the amendment is all about “taking tougher action” on predatory offshore wagering providers. \nAs for Jared, he’s not sure exactly what he’ll do if he can no longer rely on the income he generates from playing online poker. \n“Unfortunately, I’m probably just gonna have to go get a job,” he said. “And whatever happens from there I don’t really know.” \n* Name has been changed", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T07:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T02:34:13.087+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
