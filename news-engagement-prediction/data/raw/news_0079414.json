His first one-man show in the United States was at the Staempfli Gallery in Manhattan in 1961. “In such unusual sculptural subjects as racehorses crossing the finish line, or in a majestic modern version of a quadriga, where energy seems to explode from within the mass,” Stuart Preston wrote in The New York Times , “he achieves a concentration of animal power that is most impressive.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Six years later, Mr. Koenig was among five sculptors commissioned by the Port Authority to produce artworks for the World Trade Center, then being planned. The twin towers were to be the tallest buildings in the world, though they were soon surpassed by the Sears Tower in Chicago. Minoru Yamasaki , the chief architect of the trade center, was his real patron, Mr. Koenig said. “Yamasaki kept asking me to make the sculpture bigger and bigger to complement his design, but I wanted to make something in contrast,” Mr. Koenig told The Times in 2001 . \nAdvertisement What resulted was “Sphere” (or “Grosse Kugelkaryatide,” the large spherical caryatid). Its smooth golden surface was sliced by incisions and shattered in some places by Cubist eruptions. Photo “Sphere,” commissioned for the World Trade Center, stood between the twin towers.

But Mr. Koenig described it as “a head, and a Cyclops” and “in some ways a self-portrait.” Some viewers saw the head as wearing a helmet. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “Laughingly, I said to Yamasaki, ‘The helmet is there because when your towers fall, I don’t want my head to be crushed by them,’” Mr. Koenig recalled in 2001. “I was joking, of course, but who knows why I said that?” At Mauthausen, Mr. Koenig created a harrowing tableau to serve as the West German memorial. At the juncture of two broad planes, and dwarfed by them, are what appear to be a sphere and four rods . After a moment’s study, however, a human figure reveals itself, huddled, emaciated, shivering — if it is alive at all. It was finished in 1983. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
