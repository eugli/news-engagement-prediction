Local folklore says that a groundhog – a type of marmot, also known as woodchuck or whistlepig – can predict the weather for the next month and a half. \nIt stems from a Christian holiday, Candlemas Day. Taking place halfway between the winter solstice and spring equinox, priests would bless candles and, if it was a sunny day, it meant there would be a longer winter. If it was cloudy, warm weather was expected. \nA hedgehog was later brought into the mix. When early German settlers in the US carried on the European tradition, they started to use groundhogs instead. \nBack in the 1880s, the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club would also hold a groundhog hunt in the summer, but stopped as Phil’s popularity grew. \nAs many as 30,000 people gather to witness Phil’s prediction and the festivities bring $1 million to the local economy each year. \nThe reason the groundhogs stick their heads out of the ground isn’t just to help us predict the weather. Male groundhogs are on the hunt for mates at this time. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T19:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T14:36:56.331+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
