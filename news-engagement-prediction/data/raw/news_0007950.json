Disneyland's new dining room, 21 Royal, features luxury meals for up to 12 guests at a price tag of $15,000. Disneyland's new dining room, 21 Royal, features luxury meals for up to 12 guests at a price tag of $15,000. (Walt Disney Co.) Hugo Martin \n“They can leverage this to appeal to new people,” he said. “This allows them to grow the luxury market.” \nBrown’s description of 21 Royal as “a new luxury experience” is borne out by the exclusive first look given to the Robb Report, a magazine that touts itself as the “definitive authority on connoisseurship for ultra-affluent consumers.” \nThe dining room is decorated in aqua blue with gold trimming, a fireplace and paintings that depict old New Orleans life. \nThe dining room is connected to a two-bedroom suite, dubbed the Dream Suite. The suite was the brainchild of Walt Disney himself, who had a small apartment built above the fire station on Main Street. \nBut Disney envisioned a larger apartment where he could entertain VIP guests. He died in 1966 before the project was completed. \nFrom 1987 to 2007, the space was turned into the Disney Gallery and used to display Disney Imagineering artwork. In 2008, the gallery was overhauled to realize Disney’s idea of a luxury apartment, which was offered to guests as part of special promotions. \nThe 21 Royal dining room includes a balcony that overlooks Rivers of America, offering a prime spot for watching the “Fantasmic” water and light show. \nThe food, served on gold-trimmed plates, is prepared by two master chefs and accompanied by wine chosen by a dedicated sommelier. \nThe dining room represents only one of several high-priced options at the theme park. \nAlso located in New Orleans Square is Club 33, an exclusive club conceived by Walt Disney as a place to entertain dignitaries, investors and other VIPs at a cost to most members of more than $11,000 a year. Disney officials refuse to divulge how many members are allowed into the club, but Disney experts say the waiting list is probably several years long. \nThe park also offers VIP tours that start at $2,400, plus the price of admission. The deal includes a private tour guide who chaperones up to 10 guests around the park, getting them into more than 30 attractions without waiting in long lines. VIP seating for shows and parades is included.   \nTo read more about the travel and tourism industries, follow @hugomartin on Twitter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:37:00.641+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
