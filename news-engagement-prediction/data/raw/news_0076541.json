'It was very quick,' said Santos. 'I saw a few journalists taking pictures close to the float get injured. 'I can't remember the last time I saw an accident here.' The three conductors of the float will be questioned Monday morning, said police investigator William Lourenco Bezerra. Bezerra added that one driver already had been identified as the main focus of the investigation. 'The last float went into reverse and ended up pressing revelers against the fence on one side. That caused chaos,' Bezerra said. 'Then the conductors made a quick maneuver to the opposite direction and injured more people. 'The main conductor of the float mixed with the rest of the samba school and left. But he has already been identified and will be investigated.' People make a cordon as firefighters assist people run over by a float in Rio on Sunday night Paraiso do Tuiuti was the first of six samba schools parading in the night's extravaganza at the Sambadrome, which was scheduled to run until early Monday. Only revelers at the entrance of the Sambadrome were aware of the incident. Many agreed with the decision to carry on 'It is all very sad, but to stop Carnival would create an even bigger problem,' said Jonas Elias, a tourist from Salvador. 'Of course this spoils the party a bit, but to frustrate all this crowd would make the tragedy even bigger.'
