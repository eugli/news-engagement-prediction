I use it as a way to get stuff out. It's not something I see myself following career-wise,\" she told her interviewer, Lee Daniels , for the issue. \"There are so many amazing artists in my family. If I were to do it as a career, it would change how I feel about music and I don't want that to happen.\" Photos \nMichael Jackson: A Life Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images \nWhile she doesn't plan to rise to the top of the charts like the late king of pop, her father is her constant motivation. \"[He is] all of my inspiration. I would say 99 percent of my inspiration comes from him, because he has always been my world,\" she said. \"He is my roots.\" \nNearly a decade since his untimely death, Michael remains a major influence in his children's lives, including Paris who wishes she had his \"strength\" the most. \n\"He was the strongest person I know and tried to do everything with as much love and kindness as possible,\" she told Daniels. \nAs she returns to the spotlight as an independent adult, Paris, who has nine tattoos dedicated to her father, will always carry him with her, even if she never takes the stage like he did. \n\"He's brought me nothing but joy,\" she previously told Rolling Stone . \"So why not have constant reminders of joy?\" TAGS/ Paris Jackson , Michael Jackson , Music  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:54:41.829+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
