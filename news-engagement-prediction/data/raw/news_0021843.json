Nazar Hussain, from Sajjadabad in Punjab, Pakistan, took his wife Suriya Begum to nearby Naurangabad for spiritual healing, where two fake holy men, known as pirs, told him that his wife required exorcism. The fake spiritual healers, identified as Amaanullah and Abdul Hameed, then set upon Suriya, tying her to a tree and beating her with sticks. The fake spiritual healers tied a woman to a tree and beat her with sticks, refusing to stop even when she screamed in agony (file photo) The men then continued with the fake exorcism by tying her upside-down and throwing smoke at her as she screamed in pain, Geo TV reports. Hussain claims he tried to stop the 'exorcism' after he watched his wife screaming in agony, but both of the fake holy men refused to stop.
