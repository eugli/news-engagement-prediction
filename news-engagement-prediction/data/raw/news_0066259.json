Jungle Creations/MailOnline \nThe superwoman was caught on camera being heckled at a stoplight by workmen in a van while she sat on her bicycle trying to ignore them. \nMoments into the harassment, the men began making offensive remarks, yelling things like, “You on your period?” and “Give me your number.” \nShe was NOT going to have it. Female cyclist gets revenge on cat-calling workmen To view this video please enable JavaScript, and considerupgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nThe entire debacle was caught on camera by a moped rider who luckily had a GoPro camera attached to his helmet. \nHe ended up stopping behind the bicyclist at a red light the moment the men in the truck began catcalling her at the stoplight and followed her throughout the ordeal. \nOnce he pulled up to the scene, he immediately knew something was not right because the woman immediately punched the van’s mirror in as a response to the harassment. Jungle Creations/MailOnline \nThe man in the work van reacts to her anger and says, \nWoah! That’s not very lady-like is it, ay? \nOi, what charm school did you go to, ay? You wanna tell your mum and dad to get their fucking money back? OH NO YOU DIDN’T. \nMoments later, the rude worker asks the woman if she’s on her period and insists she give him her number so they can go out for a drink. LOL, OK. Not happening, creep. Jungle Creations/MailOnline \nAfter making his final remarks, he drives away… but the infuriated woman isn’t quite done with them yet. \nInstead of giving up and biking back home, she peddled fast and followed the van throughout the winding roads — and the moped rider followed. Jungle Creations/MailOnline \nSoon enough, the van stopped and she pulled up right next to the passenger side. These guys obviously had no idea who they were messing with. \nAs revenge for catcalling her at the previous light, she ferociously ripped off the passenger side mirror, slammed it onto the ground and took off. YUP. SHE RIPPED THE MIRROR OFF THE VAN AND RODE AWAY LIKE A GODDAMN HERO. Jungle Creations/MailOnline \nThe man watching from the moped was obviously impressed and proud of the anonymous badass, and pulled up to the van for a final word with the passengers. \nHe said, \nThat’s exactly what you deserve you scum! Jungle Creations/MailOnline \nIt’s true. That’s exactly what they deserved. \nBrava, you anonymous hero on wheels, you. \nHopefully, these guys will think again before they catcall another woman on the street again… that is, unless they want another mirror ripped off the side of their vehicle. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
