West Elm \nHell hath no fury like those scorned by a crappy couch. \nWest Elm removed a couch from its website after a piece titled ‚Äú Why Does This One Couch From West Elm Suck So Much? ‚Äù was published last week at The Awl, generating a lot of buzz. \nThe ‚ÄúPeggy Couch‚Äù is a tufted mid-century modern-style sofa with cloth-covered buttons that reportedly pop off after mild use. @westelm What do I do about buttons coming out of my peggy couch cushions? 3 total now. Beautiful, but seems to lack quality. üòï ‚Äî David Oliva (@daveotv) December 13, 2016 This loose button on my Peggy couch is my number 1 source of stress. @westelm pic.twitter.com/wjLrAlJ4UD ‚Äî Susan M (@_suemar_) January 30, 2017 @westelm just got Peggy couch & a button already fell out. Few others very loose. So frustrating. Can you help? pic.twitter.com/kqdtH8eupu ‚Äî youngna (@youngna) October 17, 2015 \nThe comments reviewing the couch on a photo West Elm posted a year ago, below, are egregiously bad. One says ‚ÄúThis is the absolute WORST piece of furniture I‚Äôve ever purchased!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME!‚Äù while another calls it the ‚Äúworst purchase ever.‚Äù A post shared by west elm (@westelm) on Feb 18, 2016 at 5:05pm PST \nIn her story for The Awl, writer Anna Hezel said she paid $1,200 for the couch, which shortly ‚Äúbegan to disintegrate.‚Äù West Elm‚Äôs customer service sent her a shoddy button-repair kit to fix the couch, she said, and employees assured her that the shelf life of West Elm couches like the Peggy is between ‚Äúone and three years... with light use.‚Äù \nHer story ends when a couch leg snaps off during a party and the whole sofa collapses. \nThe tale served as a rallying cry: Twitter users who own or owned a Peggy began speaking out, saying Hezel‚Äôs piece is an accurate representation of life with the couch. We have a West Elm Peggy couch and we agree with @HezelAnna that it is a disappointing couch https://t.co/DHm3cqDjDj ‚Äî Cogo Labs ‚ö°‚ö°‚ö° (@CogoLabs) February 16, 2017 Hi. I'm Ally. And I, too, hate my @westelm Peggy sofa. https://t.co/NOPLSmcruW ‚Äî allison manning (@allymanning) February 16, 2017 \"If you buy a couch together, either the couch or the relationship will break.\" I don't miss our Peggy: https://t.co/FAk2cLRTrP ‚Äî Andrea Silenzi (@andreasilenzi) February 19, 2017 THIS IS MY LIFE AND MY COUCH. I bought a secondhand Peggy; it came pre-destroyed with zero seat buttons. https://t.co/rzdnDfODFe ‚Äî Jackie Bernstein (@jackieberns) February 20, 2017 \nThe Peggy is now missing from Westelm.com, with no landing page to even indicate it ever existed. \nBuzzFeed spoke to employees at various stores around the country. One store in New York indicated that the couch is ‚Äúout of stock,‚Äù while another in Alabama said there is a ‚Äúquality issue‚Äù with the couches and that staffers were not told when the couch would become available again . \nThe Huffington Post reached out to Williams-Sonoma, the parent company of West Elm, and to West Elm‚Äôs public relations team and West Elm‚Äôs customer service. \nOne West Elm customer service representative told us over the phone that she ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt sure that [the Peggy] will come back‚Äù and that she couldn‚Äôt find it anywhere in the company‚Äôs system. Another representative said via email that the Peggy is ‚Äútemporarily out of stock‚Äù and we should check back mid-March to ‚Äúverify if anymore Peggy sofas are available.‚Äù \nWe‚Äôll keep our eyes peeled for the Peggy‚Äôs reappearance, but perhaps this just is what happens when you name a couch ‚ÄúPeggy.‚Äù ‚ÄúThey never should have bought a couch named after the least favorite Schuyler sister.‚Äù @candyfight to me rn #peggygate ‚Äî Lydia Polgreen (@lpolgreen) February 21, 2017 \nRIP, Peggy.
