(Getty Images) \n(CBS) The Bulls are worth $2.5 billion, Forbes estimated in its newest release of NBA franchise valuations that came out Wednesday. \nThat $2.5 billion figure makes the Bulls the league’s fourth-most valuable franchise, trailing the Knicks ($3.3 billion), Lakers ($3 billion) and Warriors ($2.6 billion). It’s also an uptick in the Bulls’ worth over a year ago, when Forbes valued the franchise at $2.3 billion , which was the third-highest in the NBA. With the help of a 73-win season, the Warriors have since passed the Bulls in estimated worth in the past year. \nThe Celtics check in at fifth in value at $2.2 billion. The average franchise is worth $1.36 billion, per Forbes. \nThe Bulls have led the NBA in attendance in each of the past seven seasons and currently top that list again this year, though there has been a noticeable uptick in no-shows at the United Center as the Bulls are 27-29 and have produced an inconsistent on-court product. \nThe worth of NBA franchises has skyrocketed in recent seasons in large part because of a massive new league television deal that went into effect for the 2016-’17 season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T23:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T06:19:32.199+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
