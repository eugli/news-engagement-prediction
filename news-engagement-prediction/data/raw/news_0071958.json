Yet it is home to the largest collection of Earth-sized planets found in the galaxy so far, the scientists said. They made their find public in the journal Nature Wednesday.\n“The star is so small and cold that the planets are temperate, which means they could have liquid water and possibly life on their surface,” said astronomer Michaël Gillon from the University of Liege in Belgium, who led the discovery team. In all, 30 astronomers from eight countries were involved in verifying the observations last year, working at seven major telescopes, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Spitzer Space Telescope.\nThe discovery adds to mounting evidence that there may be billions of such worlds in the Milky Way galaxy, the researchers said. The new findings “indicate that these planets are even more common than previously thought,” said astronomer Ignas Snellen at the University Leiden, who wasn’t involved in the project.\nAn expanded version of this story is available at WSJ.com\nAlso hot at WSJ.com\nNascar, once an icon, hits the skids\nTrump would reconsider Bannon role if McMaster asks\nMore from MarketWatch Bill Gates supposedly has long way to go to catch the real richest man in the world Apple’s stock surges to another record after Morgan Stanley boosts price target At Trump Presser, a Tale of Two Realities", "external_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/articles/long-in-victory-lane-nascar-hits-the-skids-1487686349?mod=mktw", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/seven-earth-size-worlds-discovered-orbiting-nearby-star-1487786401?mod=mktw", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-would-reconsider-bannons-role-on-national-security-council-if-asked-white-house-says-1487712036?mod=mktw"], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:58:55.138+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
