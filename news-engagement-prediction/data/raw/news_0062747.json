The company did say it will retain its Kendall Square office in Cambridge.\nA person familiar with the deal said Amazon was leasing two floors at the WeWork location, on St. James Avenue between Arlington and Berkeley streets.\nGet Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news, delivered weekdays. The Globe reported in January that Amazon was on the hunt for 100,000 to 200,000 square feet of office space in downtown Boston, enough room for hundreds of employees.\nThe WeWork deal adds to Amazon’s already significant footprint in the Boston area and reflects shifts in the market for high-tech office space around the city.\nAmazon currently leases about 171,000 square feet in Kendall Square, including 1&frac12; floors the company added in August, according to county property records. Amazon’s Cambridge offices include a speech-science division working on the company’s Alexa voice-assistant products, a key part of Amazon’s efforts to sell its own personal technology devices.\nAdvertisement\nBut commercial real estate in Kendall Square has become much more expensive in recent years as biotech and pharmaceutical headquarters have increasingly sprouted up. That has helped push many tech companies across the river into Boston, where rents can be cheaper.\n“We have some technology companies here, but this is one of the world’s five or 10 largest technology companies,” said Brendan Carroll, head of Encompass Real Estate Strategy, which tracks Boston’s office market. “I think it’s an enormous statement for the city of Boston.”\nHaving WeWork as a landlord also could be attractive in its own right for a fast-growing company. WeWork typically offers more flexible terms than traditional corporate real estate managers, giving tenants the ability to add or shrink their footprint as hiring needs change.\nWeWork opened the Back Bay location Feb. 1, part of a local expansion that includes another office in Cambridge’s Central Square, expected to open in a few weeks.\nCurt Woodward can be reached at curt.woodward@globe.com .
