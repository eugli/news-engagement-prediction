The Beauty and the Beast star has been promoting the live-action remake of the 1991 Disney animated classic in a myriad of designers, from Oscar de la Renta to Louis Vuitton . Indeed, Watson’s press junket wardrobe has run the gamut from ladylike to contemporary, though perhaps the common thread between them is the fact that at least one outfit is from a major French fashion house, a nod to the bookish heroine’s place of birth, no doubt. Now it seems that Watson is extending this same principle where her accessories are concerned by toting around Givenchy’s new Horizon bag.

Watson traded an oversize weekender in favor of a sleek rolling suitcase that complemented her compact cross-body bag—equal parts polished and practical. We also saw the structured style on Michelle Obama , though Watson managed to make the add-on all her own. She threw a motorcycle leather jacket over a knit body-skimming dress for a clever pairing that promised to look pulled-together even after a train ride. Lace-up paddock boots lent the ensemble an equestrian element that touched on her on-screen counterpart’s preferred mode of transportation. But the most Belle–worthy pieces of all were the book in her bag and a bouquet of red roses peeking out from underneath her arm.
