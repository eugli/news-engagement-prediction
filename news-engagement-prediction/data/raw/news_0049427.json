Sisters Suki and Immy Waterhouse, both longtime fans of the label, arrived at the evening show wearing crop tops and trademark takes on bohemian bedhead. Suki’s shoulder-sweeping blonde was finished with a bounce of curl and a sideswept bang—calling to mind the slept-in rock ’n’ roll glamour of 1960s-era Anita Pallenberg. Meanwhile, Immy’s waist-length, center-parted style swung loose over her shoulders and was finished with a hint of Glastonbury-ready bend. In addition to a shared shade of golden blonde, the sisters had one more beauty signature in common in the form of twinning brushed-up brows and a palette of cool pink makeup. Proof that while a dramatic haircut or quick-change red lip is worth its weight in shock value, some smartly reworked beauty classics will always turn heads.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T05:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:34:53.351+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
