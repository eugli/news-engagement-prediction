But, the device’s power (good for the size) comes at a price — poor battery life. To compensate for this, the company has announced a new battery pack accessory that extends the Blade Stealth’s battery life to “past 15 hours.” \nThe Razer Power Bank cost $149.99, has a 12,800 mAh capacity, and is made from CNC-milled aluminum. It’s got two regular USB-A ports and a single USB-C port for powering devices (it can handle three simultaneously), and uses Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 technology to top up the Blade Stealth with an extra six hours of battery life in two hours of charging. Razer says the bank is “optimized” to work with the Blade Stealth but is compatible with any laptop powered by USB-C — like, for example, Apple’s 12-inch Macbook . \nRazer first announced the Blade Stealth ultrabook at CES last year , but has since upgraded the device, adding more RAM and a faster Intel CPU last September . As the addition of the Power Bank shows, though, battery life is still an issue. If you’re interested you can grab one of Razer’s new power banks from the company’s website , although it’s worth noting there are cheaper USB-C power banks available, just not with Razer’s branding. \nThe Power Bank is pocketable at least.
