Cassavell / MLB.com | + 0 COMMENTS \nTEMPE, Ariz. -- Infielder Kaleb Cowart 's go-ahead RBI double in the seventh inning lifted the Angels to a 5-3 win over the Padres on Monday at Tempe Diablo Stadium. \nAngels newcomers Danny Espinosa and Cameron Maybin -- acquired in offseason trades to fill holes at second base and left field, respectively -- both chipped in to help Los Angeles improve to 3-0 this spring. Espinosa contributed an RBI single in the fourth, while Maybin drew a walk and scored in the same inning. \nWil Myers went 1-for-2 with an RBI single, walk and stolen base while playing five innings at first base for the Padres, who are still in search of their first victory after three Cactus League games. Infielder Dusty Coleman also slugged a solo home run in the top of the seventh that briefly tied the game at 3-3, before Cowart restored the Angels' lead in the bottom half of the inning. Coleman's game-tying home run SD@LAA: Coleman belts a game-tying solo homer Dusty Coleman drives a solo home run to right field, tying the game at 3 in the top of the 7th inning \nReigning American League Most Valuable Player Mike Trout walked twice in two plate appearances and played five innings in center field in his spring debut for the Angels. \nPadres catcher Austin Hedges opened the scoring with an RBI single in the top of the second, but the Angels evened the game on right fielder Kole Calhoun 's run-scoring single in the bottom of the third. Hedges' RBI single SD@LAA: Hedges opens the scoring with an RBI single Austin Hedges finds a hole and delivers an RBI single to center field to open the scoring for the Padres in the top of the 2nd inning \nTyrell Jenkins , who has an outside shot of winning a spot in San Diego's rotation, threw two scoreless innings with a walk and strikeout in his Cactus League debut. The sinker-baller didn't allow a ball out of the infield and recorded four ground-ball outs. \n\"I'm all for competition,\" Jenkins said. \"I know obviously nothing's going to be handed to us, but when it comes down to it, I see myself being right there in the [rotation] mix with those guys. I'm going to do everything possible to break with the team. In my mind, the only person who can stop me is me. If I can get better and keep putting the ball on the ground and getting outs, that's something that you want, starter or reliever.\" \nAngels right-hander JC Ramirez allowed one run on two hits while walking two and striking out three over 1 2/3 innings. Ramirez has worked exclusively out of the bullpen in his first three Major League seasons, but the Angels are trying him as a starter this spring. He is a candidate for a job in the Halos' rotation or bullpen. \n\"I'm not used to going back to the dugout and coming back inside,\" Ramirez said. \"I think by the third hitter [in the second inning], I was feeling tired a little bit. That's why I was throwing my sinker away. I just have to get used to it. I know I'm strong enough to keep doing it. I have to build my innings, I guess.\" \nPadres Up Next: Jhoulys Chacin is set for his spring debut, when the Padres host the Giants on Tuesday at 12:10 p.m. PT on MLB.TV. The veteran right-hander signed a one-year deal with San Diego in December and is slated to pitch for Team Venezuela in the World Baseball Classic. He starts on Tuesday against Madison Bumgarner . \nAngels Up Next: Left-hander Manny Banuelos , a former top prospect who is among the long list of contenders for the final spot in the Angels rotation, will make his first start of the spring Tuesday, as the Halos face the World Series champion Cubs at Sloan Park. First pitch is set for 12:05 p.m. PT on MLB.TV. \nWatch every out-of-market regular-season game live on MLB.TV . covers the Angels for MLB.com. covers   Follow him on Twitter @ajcassavell  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:41:10.549+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
