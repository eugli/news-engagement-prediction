Clooney did the interview ahead of France’s Cesar Awards on Friday, where he will receive an honorary award. \nAs part of the 13-minute-long interview, Clooney addressed Meryl Streep’s political speech at the Golden Globes that sparked outrage from certain right-wing political factions. Trump reacted by tweeting that she is “one of the most overrated actresses in Hollywood.” \n“There’s a really interesting argument, this is the part that makes you a little crazy,” Clooney said. “When Meryl spoke, everyone on that one side was, ‘Well that’s elitist Hollywood speaking.’ Donald Trump has 22 acting credits in television. He collects $120,000 a year in his Screen Actors Guild pension fund. He is a Hollywood elitist.” \nClooney went on to call out Bannon’s Hollywood ties as well. \n“Steve Bannon is a failed film writer and director,” Clooney said. “That’s the truth, that’s what he’s done. He wrote a Shakespearean rap musical about the L.A. riots that he couldn’t get made. He made a lot of money off of ‘Seinfeld.’ He’s elitist Hollywood, I mean that’s the reality.” \nWatch the video below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:23:45.927+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
