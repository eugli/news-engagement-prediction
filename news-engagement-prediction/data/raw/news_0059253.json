Left-hander Ariel Miranda starts the opener against the Padres. \nMiranda enters camp as Seattle's sixth starter, likely to fill in if anything happens to anyone in the projected rotation. If not, he's ticketed to start the season in the bullpen. \n\"I feel really good, really prepared mentally and physically,\" Miranda said through interpreter Fernando Alcala. \"All that's left to do is go out and do the job.\" Miranda is vital to Mariners Miranda could prove vital in Mariners' 2017 staff MLB.com Mariners reporter Greg Johns looks at where left-hander Ariel Miranda could fit in the club's pitching staff in 2017 \nSan Diego will counter with 29-year-old right-hander Paul Clemens , who was 4-5 with a 4.04 ERA in 18 outings for the Marlins and Padres last year and is one of a big group competing for starting roles in his camp. \nMiranda figures to throw two innings, followed by Ryan Weber , Cody Martin , James Pazos , Shae Simmons and Casey Fien . \nWhile the game is just the first of 36 Cactus League contests for Seattle, Servais said there's some increased intensity among his six Major Leaguers who are ticketed for World Baseball Classic duties: Cano, Cruz, Edwin Diaz , Yovani Gallardo , Drew Smyly and Hernandez. \nGallardo, Hernandez and Smyly will start Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday next week, while Cano and Cruz are ticketed for more at-bats than they'd normally get this early in spring. \n\"They just want to get some timing down and make sure they feel good at the plate,\" Servais said. \"You will see those guys play a little more than every other day going forward.\" \nThe WBC 2017 group -- which also includes non-roster camp invitees Tyler O'Neill , Pat Venditte and Sebastian Valle -- will join their national teams during the first week of March and return to the Mariners once their squads are eliminated. The tournament runs through March 22, and Cano and Cruz could be competing right to the end with the defending champion Dominican Republic team. \nSaturday's Cactus League game will be broadcast on radio only.
