Indians earning less than 250,000 rupees do not pay income tax. \nIndians with larger incomes will also enjoy the tax break, saving 12,500 rupees ($185) each. But they will still face higher rates on income earned above 500,000 rupees. For example, the tax rate on income above 1 million rupees ($14,800) is 30%. \nThe Indian government hopes the concession will convince more people to pay taxes and widen the country's shockingly small tax base. Less than 2% of the country's 1.3 billion citizens pay any income tax at all. \nThe tax cut will be paid for with a 10% surcharge on income between 5 million rupees ($74,000) and 10 million rupees ($148,000). \nRelated: India's tax dodgers still hiding hundreds of billions \n\"We are largely a tax non-compliant society,\" Jaitley said Wednesday. \"The predominance of cash in our economy makes it possible for people to evade taxes.\" \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi launched a dramatic effort last year to reduce India's reliance on cash. In November, he shocked the country by suddenly scrapping all 500 and 1,000 rupee notes. \nThe move instantly made 86% of India's cash worthless and sparked chaos around the country, hitting several key sectors of the economy and dramatically slowing India's stellar growth rate. \nRelated: 50 days of pain after India trashed its cash \nThe government has stuck to its guns, saying the effort will reduce corruption and tax evasion. Jaitley described it as a \"bold and decisive measure\" in his budget speech. \n\"For several decades, tax evasion for many had become a way of life,\" the finance minister said. \"This has bred a parallel economy that is unacceptable in an inclusive society.\" CNNMoney (New Delhi) First published February 1, 2017: 7:10 AM ET ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T19:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T14:25:09.916+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
