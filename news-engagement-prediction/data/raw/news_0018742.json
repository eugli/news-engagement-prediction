The father the son and the Holy Spirit has decided that 3 is the number.” \nBut one level headed doubter hit back: “These are not signs of Jesus return. We have lunar eclipses often. \n“We have a snow moon every February. This comet comes around every five years. A great event to see but not signs of the end of the world.” \nOn Friday, February 10, a lunar eclipse will kick off the 24 hours of celestial beauty, where the sun, Earth and the moon all align. \nBecause the Earth is blocking out the sun’s light, the moon is darkened.
