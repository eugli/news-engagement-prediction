(You know, because at least some head coaches have to do something besides literally kissing the president .) \nAs the Spurs prepared to take on the Sixers on Thursday night, Popovich was asked about the importance of Black History Month—a subject, as you may recall, with which President Trump proved very unfamiliar on Wednesday. Pop responded with an impressively nuanced take on systemic inequality and the role of privilege in American society. Deadspin has the transcript: \nBut more than anything, I think if people take the time to think about it, I think it is our national sin. It always intrigues me when people come out with, ‘I’m tired of talking about that or do we have to talk about race again?’ And the answer is you’re damned right we do . Because it’s always there, and it’s systemic in the sense that when you talk about opportunity it’s not about ‘Well, if you lace up your shoes and you work hard, then you can have the American dream.’ That’s a bunch of hogwash . If you were born white, you automatically have a monstrous advantage educationally, economically, culturally in this society and all the systemic roadblocks that exist, whether it’s in a judicial sense, a neighborhood sense with laws, zoning, education, we have huge problems in that regard that are very complicated, but take leadership, time, and real concern to try to solve. It’s a tough one because people don’t really want to face it. \nHe then pivoted to the racist conspiracy theory on which President Trump built his political reputation: \nWe have a president of the United States who spent four or five years disparaging and trying to illegitimatize our president. And we know that was a big fake, but still felt for some reason it had to be done. I can still remember a paraphrase close to a quote: “Investigators were sent to Hawaii and you cannot believe what they found.” Well, that was a lie. So if it’s being discussed and perpetrated at that level, you’ve got a national problem. \nThis isn't the first time that Pop has offered thoughtful, off-the-cuff responses to non-basketball questions about social issues, or the first time he's called out President Trump in particular . Nonetheless, it sets a powerful example for players, coaches, and fans when one of the league's most revered figures is unafraid of doing something other than Sticking to Sports. \nFor his part, Kerr also sharply criticized Trump in the days immediately following November's election, and of late has not-so-subtly pushed back on the White House's \"alternative facts\" narrative. Check out this burn Kerr landed on befuddled liar Sean Spicer earlier this week: \nhttps://twitter.com/anthonyVslater/status/823252409157898247 \nKerr's words have been most powerful, though, when discussing the president's Muslim ban . Kerr was born in Lebanon, and his father, who served as president of the American University of Beirut, was murdered by members of the Islamic Jihad terrorist group in 1984 when Kerr was just a freshman in college. In other words, Kerr's bona fides on the subject are beyond dispute, and here's what he had to say about the ban earlier this week: \nAs someone whose family member is a victim of terrorism, having lost my father—if we’re trying to combat terrorism by banishing people from coming to this country, we’re really going against the principles of what our country is about, and creating fear. It’s the wrong way to go about it. If anything, we could be breeding anger and terror, so I’m completely against what’s happening. I think it’s shocking. I think it’s a horrible idea and I feel for all the people who are affected, families are being torn apart. \nhttps://twitter.com/ChrisBHaynes/status/825930077359648768 \nThe NBA is almost certainly the most socially conscious of the major sports leagues, and it's empowering to see two of its highest-profile leading men getting in on the act, too. Since Pop and Kerr get along so well anyway, if they get tired of coaching and want to go in on some kind of joint venture in the next few years, I can certainly think of a gig they might want to check out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T10:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T09:16:43.753+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
