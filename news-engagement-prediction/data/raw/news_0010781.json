"highlightText": "", "language": "english", "persons": [], "text": "comments There was plenty for fans of the Premier League to sink their teeth into this weekend as Chelsea overcame London rivals Arsenal with ease. While the Blues look likely to secure the league title, the relegation battle continues to excite with Sunderland thrashing rivals Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park to give their survival hopes a huge boost. As ever, Ralph Ellis has studied all the stats and facts from the latest round of games from the Premier League and beyond to bring you the 10 things we learned from it all... Eden Hazard scored a wonderful goal as Chelsea defeated rivals Arsenal 3-1 at the weekend Sam Allardyce was humiliated by former team Sunderland as Crystal Palace lost 4-0 1. Chelsea's defending begins from the front and Arsenal couldn't cope with the way Antonio Conte's forwards ratted around trying to win the ball back. Between them Pedro (67), Diego Costa (70) and Eden Hazard (57) made 194 sprints during the 3-0 win at Stamford Bridge. That was 49 more than Arsenal's front three of Alex Iwobi (53), Alexis Sanchez (45) and Theo Walcott (47) – a huge difference even allowing for Walcott getting subbed after 70 minutes. Chelsea's Spanish forward Pedro (right) made 67 sprints during the victory over Arsenal 2. David de Gea looked pretty annoyed at getting booked by ref Anthony Taylor near the end of Manchester United's win at Leicester and no wonder. The Spanish goalkeeper has an amazing disciplinary record to protect and why would he waste time with his side 3-0 up and only two minutes left? Since arriving in England at the start of the 2011 season, before Sunday De Gea had been shown only two yellow cards in all competitions for United in 255 appearances. David de Gea, who has an amazing disciplinary record to protect, was booked at Leicester 3. Pep Guardiola has spent all season with limited success encouraging his full backs to move into midfield attacking positions, but he might just have found an answer by using Brazilian Fernandinho. The 31-year-old, named on the bench for the midweek win at West Ham, looked a natural fit after being tried in the right-back berth against Swansea. He hit more accurate forward half passes (61) than any other City player. Manchester City's Brazilian midfielder Fernandinho impressed at right back against Swansea 4. Shane Long must be wondering what he has to do to gain the trust of Southampton manager Claude Puel after getting dropped despite scoring three goals in five games. The Frenchman suggested in his post-match press conference that he didn't think Long and new £14m signing Manolo Gabbiadini could fit in the same side. Yet it was only when Long came off the bench to play alongside the Italian for the final 27 minutes of the 3-1 defeat by West Ham that Saints had any real threat. In that time the dynamic Republic of Ireland striker made 23 sprints, only one less than Sofiane Boufal managed in the 63 minutes before giving way to him. Shane Long was dropped from Southampton line-up despite scoring three goals in five games 5. Tottenham have to hope that Harry Kane stays fit for the rest of the season if they are to have any hope of closing down the nine-point gap behind Chelsea. The striker has now got 14 goals in 16 games since returning from ankle ligament damage, at the rate of one every 98 minutes. Tottenham have taken 2.16 points per game with him in their team, but just 1.8 points without him. Harry Kane has now got 14 goals in 16 games since returning from ankle ligament damage 6. With 16 goals conceded in Bournemouth's last five games, Eddie Howe must also be worried that his transfer market spending has brought such little reward. He paid a club record £15m for Liverpool's Jordon Ibe but the winger, a second half sub in the 6-3 defeat at Everton, has yet to play 90 minutes despite making 18 appearances. And £12m striker Benik Afobe has also spent most of the season on the bench, playing just the final seven minutes at Goodison Park. Jordon Ibe, a second half substitute in 6-3 defeat at Everton, has struggled at Bournemouth 7. One of Marco Silva's earliest decisions was to dump goalkeeper David Marshall and make Eldin Jakupovic his No 1, and it is proving a great call. The 32-year-old former Switzerland international was brilliant in the 2-0 win over Liverpool, with five outstanding saves a few days after he'd also made six at Old Trafford. Hull have picked up seven points in four League matches since Jakupovic has been in the side. Eldin Jakupovic was brilliant in Hull's 2-0 win over Liverpool and made five outstanding saves 8. Swedish defender Pontus Jansson boasted on Twitter about how proud he was for the way Leeds players stood up for each other during the brawl that saw boss Garry Monk and his Huddersfield opposite number David Wagner both sent to the stands. But the 25-year-old might do better to keep out of trouble after getting booked for his part in the fracas that followed Michael Hefele's 89th minute winning goal. That was Jansson's 13th yellow card of the season, with 11 in his last 16 games including one on international duty. Pontus Jansson boasted about how proud he was for way Leeds stars stood up for each other 9. When former Hull boss Phil Brown took over at Southend in March of 2013 most assumed he saw it as a stepping stone to return to the big time. But the 57-year-old has turned down other jobs after winning promotion and the 3-1 win that knocked Scunthorpe off the top of League One was his 200th game in charge. Former West Brom striker Marc-Antoine Fortune, who has just signed a new contract, was among the scorers in a result that put Southend into the play-off places. Former Hull boss Phil Brown is now in charge of League One outfit Southend 10. A season of crisis off the field for Crewe is now lurching towards a crisis on it as well after they got battered 4-0 at Exeter. They are now in severe danger of a second successive relegation, just four points above the safety zone after taking just seven points from the last 14 games. New manager David Artell saw captain Harry Davis and striker Ryan Lowe both leave the club in January and his move to sign Scunthorpe striker Jonathon Margetts collapsed due to red tape. Crewe have been a member of the Football League since 1921.
