I designed my brand for her,” she told bdnews24.com on Wednesday. \n“The jewellery by Ora tie together the east and the west. I have a lot of respect for gold or Kundon that form our tradition, but women are complex and I mean to open up the world to them.” \nMardia said she did not start her brand with fine ornaments because custom jewellery formed a broader concept that allowed more adventure. \n“There is definitely a middle eastern element in Ora which I found in Turkey and their use of a lot of greens and semi-precious stones. Then there is also the connection with Italy and France.” \nBut how Ora will reach out to women will depend on insights of those who visit the exhibition, she said. \n“A lot of it will depend on you… the women who will be there. We are definitely listening to opinions before deciding whether we will sell online or have a store.” \nThe prices of the products that will be quoted on spot at the exhibition were set based on uniqueness and availability, she added. \nAs for the many online outlets selling foreign jewellery through social media, she said, “I have been researching on competition. But fortunately there is nothing similar to what we have. Our products, customer service will set us apart.” \nDespite being a startup, Ora already has an endorsement from Bengali screen legend Kabori Sarwar. \n“It was such a dream-come-true because she is a big icon. I feel so honoured that she was excited about this.” \nOra’s exhibition will be open from 11am to 9pm at Edge Gallery in Bay’s Edgewater on Feb 11 and Feb 12.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T22:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T11:24:56.966+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
