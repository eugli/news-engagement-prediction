PUBLISHED: 00:29, Tue, Feb 28, 2017 | UPDATED: 01:56, Tue, Feb 28, 2017 BBC/GETTY IDS blasted Sir John Major for his anti-Brexit speech which was 'sad' \nThe former Tory leader felt his predecessor – who previously promised to stay out of political debates – sounded “strangely bitter” as he made a series of “unrealistic and angry threats” opposing Brexit during a “rather sad” speech. \nSpeaking to Emily Maitlis on BBC’s Newsnight, a bewildered IDS said: “What I thought when I looked at the speech, was that this was a peculiar speech, in the sense that it looked backwards the whole time the time.

Who voted for Brexit? UK regions which voted leave revealed Mon, February 27, 2017 Much of the North East of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union including Sunderland, Gateshead, Darlington, Durham, Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Stockton, Redcar and Cleveland, North Tyneside and South Tyneside, and Northumberland. Newcastle was the only borough to vote to remain.

To be pessimistic about them I think is the wrong attitude.\" BBC IDS urged Britain to maintain an optimistic outlook on Brexit \nThe former Work and Pensions Secretary has previously denied that people were misinformed during the debate and said that his Government was working to deliver Brexit. \nSpeaking on Sky News last week, Smith said: “The British people made a decision only a matter of months ago after a robust and fairly long debate, asked the question, do you want to stay or do you want to leave the European Union.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:07:59.186+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
