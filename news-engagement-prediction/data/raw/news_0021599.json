We have sent you a verification email. To verify, just follow the link in the message 4 /32 Ranveer asks Bhansali to cut down Shahid's role in 'Padmavati' to a special appearance? That Ranveer Singh is at the top of his game is a given, but the fact that Sanjay Leela Bhansali's two directorials, 'Ram-Leela' and 'Bajirao Mastani' helped Ranveer in cementing his superstar status in Bollywood cannot be denied. Hence, it comes as an unpleasant surprise that the actor, who considers Bhansali as his mentor, is now at loggerheads with him regarding their next collaboration, 'Padmavati'. Reportedly, the actor has put forth a very strong condition and has asked Bhansali to cut down co-star Shahid Kapoor's role and bill him as special / guest appearance, which the director has outright refused to do so, saying it would be unfair to Shahid. The reports further suggest that Bhansali had his own valid reasons for not agreeing to Ranveer's demands; firstly, the director has booked equal number of dates of both Ranveer and Shahid and secondly, Shahid agreed to come on board only after being assured that his role will be as meaty as Ranveer's in the film. Hence, Bhansali argues that if he bills Shahid's role as special / guest appearance then he will leave the film, which is the last thing Bhansali wants to happen at this stage of the film which was supposed to go on floors few days ago. The director has now asked Ranveer's ladylove Deepika to step in and bail him out of the crisis by convincing Ranveer to start shooting. Reports even suggest that Bhansali has decided to not work with Ranveer ever in the future after 'Padmavati'. Sigh!
