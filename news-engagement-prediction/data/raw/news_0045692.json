Outcasts. Scientologists. Why the popular scholar’s new TV show on the world’s religions might end up revealing just as much about the U.S. by Twitter By James Adolphus. Courtesy of CNN. Times are changing, says Reza Aslan . The endless tick-tock of New York Times news alerts and disorienting tweets from the president have reminded Americans that our collective identity as a people and nation is continually being redefined. “It creates more fertile ground for larger conversations about American identity,” Aslan, the religious scholar and public intellectual, said of America’s present political and cultural turmoil. “Instead of dealing with these issues on an issue-by-issue basis, I think it’s easier now to draw larger conclusions.” Enter Aslan’s new CNN show, Believer . Aslan and his production teams embarked on a grueling, worldwide tour of religious rituals. Each episode, filmed over the span of seven to ten days, focuses on a particular religious group and its adherents. Aslan walks the local walk and offers his reflections on the experience. Believer has been described—including by Aslan himself—as something akin to Anthony Bourdain’s Parts Unknown . And Aslan’s show does evoke a few aspects of Bourdain’s epicurean travelogue. Both shows ask the viewer to experience a culture through the host’s eyes and actions. Both hosts explicitly delineate the lessons they learn from each experience; where Bourdain might wax poetic about what tapas reveal about Spanish culture, Aslan divines broader conclusions by examining the purpose and context of each religion or sect. And both Aslan and Bourdain are true believers. Aslan, an Iranian-American, is a devoted scholar of religions. He throws himself into the cultures highlighted on his show with not just a scholarly curiosity, but a spiritual one. It’s clear that he is willing to give the various religions he studies—from Scientology in the United States (and Israel) to a the Aghori Hindu of Varnasi—the benefit of faith, and, in some episodes, he seems to yearn to believe. The show features a range of rituals, and their effects on Aslan, and therefore the audience, are equally diverse. The viewer gets the sense that the Scientology episode, which focuses on devout believers who continue to practice after leaving or being excommunicated from the Church of Scientology, left less of an imprint on Aslan than his visit with a death cult in Haiti, his experience amid the cremation beds of Varanasi, and an episode focused on Santa Muerte, a rapidly growing religion in Mexico. After witnessing a Mexican ritual that brought together the “poor, rich people who were gang members and narco-traffickers, transvestite prostitutes,” Aslan said it was “hard for me not to just start weeping like a baby.” “Death does not play favorites, right?” Aslan said. “Death doesn’t say, ‘Are you rich or poor? Are you gay or straight? Are you a sinner or a saint?’ Death doesn’t care. Death treats everybody the same.” At the end of the day, Aslan hopes the show not only entertains, but also demystifies that which the audience might assume is simply odd. “Look, my entire career has been built upon trying to break down the walls that separate us into different religions, ethnicities, different nationalities, different races and cultures,” Aslan said. “What I wanted to do with this show is to kind of express that in a visual way. I wanted people to come to an episode of Believer , and to see something at first glance looks weird and scary and foreign and exotic and unfamiliar and even frightening. But, throughout the hour as you’re watching me immerse myself in this community, to sort of learn from them, understand them, to experience what they experience.” Landing a CNN show has not cooled Aslan’s fiery progressive politics, which he metes out in ripostes on his Twitter feed, as well as on news programs , where he is often called upon to discuss radical Islam. I asked Aslan if having a broad understanding of religion, and fanaticism, provides him with any tools for understanding America’s current chaos. “We are in the midst of a crisis of identity in which we are trying to figure out who we are as a nation,” Aslan replied, arguing that Americans “who feel as though their privileged position in society had been shaken” are “reacting to the natural progress of human society.” “That's what fundamentalism is: it’s a reactionary phenomenon,” he said. “The problem, however, is that we have an administration that is not just feeding into that reaction, but now deliberately ignoring the most extreme versions of it.” He cites as an example the White House’s apparent unwillingness to comment on the actions of violent, “anti-government, white nationalist groups,” who, even when they plan to kill Americans, are not referred to as terrorists. “What does a white man have to do,” Aslan asks, “in order to be accused of terrorism in this country?” Believer premieres Sunday, March 5, at 10:00 P.M. on CNN.
