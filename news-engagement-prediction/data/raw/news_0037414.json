Article continues below There was something very bizarre about Gent's starting XI vs Tottenham [Tweet] \nAccording to a source close to the player, revealed on Turkish-Football, the 30-year-old has purchased a house in the neighbourhood of Chelsea and it's location is very close to the home of the current Premier League leaders, Stamford Bridge. \nTurkish newspaper Fotomac announced that Turan has began talks with the Blues officials with the idea of joining them next season, and he was photographed in London last week alongside former teammate Diego Costa. Arda's Barca career \nThe classy playmaker moved to the Nou Camp from Atletico in July 2015 but had to wait half a season for the club's transfer ban to be lifted before actually making his debut. \nThis term he's been very productive, scoring 13 goals for Barca (only Messi and Luis Suarez have more) in addition to providing six assists from his 27 appearances. \nTuran, who can play out wide or in the midfield three, had many offers from China to leave Barcelona, but Enrique's desire to keep him in Catalonia has seen him remain up to this point. \nHe's been linked with moves to Chelsea and Arsenal down the years, so only time will tell whether Arda's purchase was merely an investment or something much, much more. \nDo YOU think Arda could leave Barcelona at the end of the season? Would he fit in at either Chelsea or Arsenal? Have YOUR say in the comments box below! \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
