REUTERS/Mike Blake 9/9 By Piya Sinha-Roy | LOS ANGELES \nLOS ANGELES Hollywood's A-list stars flaunted gold and silver gowns on the Oscar red carpet on Sunday, doused with a generous helping of diamonds, feathers, sequins and symbolic blue ribbons on the world's most cinematic runway. \nEmma Stone, nominated for best actress in \"La La Land\" sparkled in a 1920s inspired gold fringed Givenchy gown, as \"Hidden Figures\" supporting actress contender Octavia Spencer opted for a silvery Marchesa adorned with a flounce of feathers. \nResembling a real-life - though much more chic - Oscar award, actress Jessica Biel sported a shimmering gold-copper Kaufman Franco beaded gown accessorized with a bold African-inspired necklace from Tiffany's. \n\"I call it perfection!\" piped in husband Justin Timberlake, wearing Tom Ford. \n\"Lion\" supporting actor nominee Dev Patel and television host Ryan Seacrest shared fashion warnings about the dangers of wearing white tuxedos jackets on a red carpet filled with women in red lipstick as Dakota Johnson floated by in a flowing gold Gucci. \nDiamonds adorned the throat of \"Hidden Figures\" star Taraji P. Henson, poured into a cleavage-bearing midnight blue Alberta Ferretti gown with a daring split at the leg. \nIsabelle Huppert, nominated for best actress for \"Elle\" showed her typically refined style in a long-sleeved silver Armani Prive gown, while Ruth Negga, also nominated in the same category for \"Loving,\" chose a lacy Valentino in the fashion house's signature vibrant red. \nNegga and other attendees like model Karlie Kloss added a blue ribbon to their gowns and tuxedos to show support for the American Civil Liberties Union, an organization that worked to get President Donald Trump's travel ban blocked in courts. \nAlso sporting a blue ribbon was Lin Manuel Miranda, best known for Broadway's \"Hamilton.\" He had his mother on his arm as his date and noted proudly that he bought his tuxedo in Yonkers, New York, at the same shop where he bought his high school prom tux years ago. \n\"Chanel Pharrell!\" proclaimed singer-songwriter Pharrell Williams, decked out in a fitted Chanel tux accessorized with a dramatic black bead necklace that fell down over the lapel. \nTwo stuffed pandas, meanwhile were the arm candy of Jackie Chan, stand-ins for the real pandas the action star adopted at a breeding facility in Chengdu, China. \n\"I am the panda ambassador! They go wherever I go, they take photos with famous people, Stallone, Clinton...,\" Chan said. \n(Writing by Alexandria Sage; Editing by Mary Milliken) Next In Entertainment News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T08:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T03:31:39.959+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
