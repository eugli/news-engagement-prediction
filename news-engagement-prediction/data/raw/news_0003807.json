I’m a vegan. But even for a meat eater, that was just wrong. It might have been lawful but it was morally wrong, cruel and barbaric.” \nThe accounts manager was driving through Trafford Park when she stopped at a roundabout at the junction of Ashburton Road West, Westinghouse Road and Parkway in Trafford Park and says she saw a man ‘hit a rabbit with a spade’.

I pulled onto the roundabout and approached him and asked what the ferrets were doing. It was then I saw the rabbit on the floor. To me it was clearly still alive. Another guy came along and threw it into the back of a 4x4. \n“This is clearly going to continue to happen along that line. It’s crazy.” \nThe new £350m Trafford Centre Metrolink line is scheduled to be operational by 2020. \nTransport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) bosses say they ‘investigated a number of options’ with their contractor, MPact-Thales, about how to remove the rabbits on Parkway.
