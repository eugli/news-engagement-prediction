At least two copies of the video described the incident as a gas plant explosion in China, and one stated it took place in Zhejiang. \nThe video has also been uploaded several times on YouTube and described as footage of a blast in Dombivali, India. \nIt was also passed off as an explosion at the Flamanville nuclear plant in France on Feb 9 this year, according to Franceinfo TV. \nThe Tuas fire took 200 firefighters four hours to put out. An eyewitness shared video of the fire with Channel NewsAsia, saying that the blaze was \"so big, like a volcano\" and that he felt tremors after the explosions. - CNA/dl", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:06:44.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
