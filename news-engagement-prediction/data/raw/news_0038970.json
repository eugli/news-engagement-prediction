She has been provided with just a fan, a pillow, a blanket and a bedsheet in Parappana Agrahara Central Jail. \nShe was also issued three saris and blouses on entering prison. Sasikala will have to make candles or incense sticks during her stay in prison and will be paid Rs 50 a day for her labour. She won't get any day off. \nShe began a four-year prison term yesterday after being convicted of corruption by the Supreme Court. \nIt has emerged that Sasikala is sharing her cell with sister-in-law Elavarasi, but there is no confirmation regarding the same as yet. \nA decision on providing her a cot to sleep on will reportedly be taken by doctors today. \nThis morning, Sasikala had tamarind rice with chutney from the breakfast menu, the officials said. \nShe also \"meditated for a few minutes\". \nMoments after walking into the Parappana Agrahara Central Jail in a rust sari last evening, Sasikala had asked a judge for a Class 1 cell citing health problems like diabetes. \nSuch a cell comes with privileges like a private television, home-cooked food and non-vegetarian meals twice a week. The request was denied. She had also asked for space to meditate and round-the-clock medical help if needed. \nSasikala had spent three weeks in the same prison in 2014 along with former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa, after both were held guilty of making a fortune beyond their known sources of income in the 1990s. \nBefore going to jail, Sasikala took some vital decisions in Chennai to secure her grip over the ruling party. She picked loyalist E Palaniswamy as Chief Ministerial candidate and brought back two nephews who had been expelled by Jayalalithaa in 2011. \nPrison sources said that Sasikala is keen to know about latest political developments in Chennai, where Governor C Vidyasagar Rao may soon announce his decision on Chief Minister. Her lawyers may again press for a TV for her.
