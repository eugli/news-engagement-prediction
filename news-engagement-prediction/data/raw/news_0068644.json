it is a pro-Union unionist organisation based in Great Britain,” DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said.\n“It has been involved in Scotland, for example supporting unionism in Scotland, and it approached the DUP to support our campaign during the referendum because it supports unionist causes in the United Kingdom.”\nThe CRC is a group of pro-Union business figures chaired by former vice chairman of the Scottish Conservative Party Richard Cook.\nIts donation enabled the DUP to promote its Leave message on a UK-wide basis, including in an expensive four-page advertisement in the Metro newspaper - not circulated in Northern Ireland.\nWe were delighted we were able to raise that amount of money.\n– Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, DUP The names of donors in Northern Ireland are automatically withheld due to Troubles-era rules which sought to protect their security.\nThat had prompted speculation that prominent Leave campaigners were using the DUP to support the Leave campaign without the need to publish their names.\nSir Jeffrey rejected that suggestion.\nThe Lagan Valley MP said the CRC had donated to the DUP because the main Leave campaign had already reached the limit of its spend.\nHe outlined the details ahead of the Electoral Commission publishing details of campaign spending on the EU referendum.\nThe watchdog found that the Brexit battle was the most expensive referendum ever fought in British political history.\nMore than £32m was spent on the campaign, with the Leave side funded by donations totalling £16.4m ahead of the Remain side's £15.1m.\nIt is disappointing that some campaigners, including both lead campaigners, appear to have not fully reported all their spending as they should have.\n– Bob Posner, Electorial Commission's director of political finance Investigations have been launched into the spending returns of both lead campaigns, Stronger In and Vote Leave.\nAfter its initial inspection of spending returns from both sides, the Commission found that neither Stronger In nor Vote Leave had submitted all the necessary invoices and receipts to back up their accounts.\nThe watchdog also said details of suppliers were missing for some payments.\nAn investigation has also been opened into missing details of suppliers, invoices and receipts in the Liberal Democrats' return, as well as into individual campaigner Peter Harris, who delivered his spending report late and without the required audit form.\n Politics Northern Ireland Belfast", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:44:07.961+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
