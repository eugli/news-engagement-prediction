The legal drama had a weak debut, and after its second episode, CBS pulled it entirely from its schedule. Things are also not looking promising for another of CBS's underperforming new dramas, \"Training Day,\" after the unexpected death of its star Bill Paxton.\nUltimately, there is only one real reason a show is considered for cancellation by a network: low ratings. This season there are at least 18 series that are in danger of being cancelled for underperforming. And of those series, 8, including \"Doubt,\" are all but officially cancelled.\nPERFECT TRIBUTE: Storm chasers honor Bill Paxton\nIn contrast, there are many reasons a network will renew a series: high ratings is an obvious one, but networks will sometimes bless a low-rated series with a renewal if there is enough critical praise or a deep degree of fan devotion. So far this year, 24 primetime network series have already been renewed for the 2017-2018 television season. Some shows, like \"This is Us,\" were such break-out hits that renewal was all but inevitable; but others, like \"Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,\" the lowest-rated show on network television, were given another season thanks to their creativity and the buzz they generate with critics and during awards season.\n(Story continues below.)\nHollywood star Bill Paxton has died after suffering complications from surgery.\nMedia: Cover Media But the vast majority of series fall somewhere in between certain cancellation and renewal: they perform well enough that they are not obviously about to be cancelled, but they don't perform quite well enough to be given an automatic renewal before May when the networks reveal their fall television schedule.\nIn the gallery above, you will find the 18 series we think are in most danger of being cancelled, the 24 series that are safe for another season, and all of the shows that fall somewhere in between.", "external_links":
