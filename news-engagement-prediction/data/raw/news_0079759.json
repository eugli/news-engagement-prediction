Some of us will stay home, work, intern, or maybe just chill. But you don’t have to waste the week. Here, 7 ways to make your spring break memorable, at little to no cost. Got Netflix? \nYou, my friend, are already in a position to make this one for the books. While some frown upon binge watching, if you have a few favorite shows you want to catch up on, spring break would be the time to do it. And you don’t have to do it alone! Choose your shows (or movies), call up some friends, get some food, and enjoy. Add to the fun: Make it a themed day/night. Take an outdoor adventure \nFind a state park in your area and take in the great outdoors. Most parks have free admission or only charge for parking, and some even offer the opportunity to do outdoor activities like hiking, kayaking, fishing and cycling. And if it’s a historical park, you may even learn something new. Dare to do something different \nSecretly have a hobby you love, but haven’t really had time for? Spring break is the time to go all in! Whatever it is, set a goal for yourself and work towards it. Practice your craft, and record or document your journey. Add to the fun: Make plans to present it to the world! Volunteer \nThis may not be a popular option, but it’s an option nonetheless, and it’ll cost you nothing. Find a cause that’s important to you go out and offer your time. You’ll be well appreciated, and you can say you spent your spring break lending a helping hand. Don’t you feel all warm and fuzzy already? Add to the fun: Convince a friend or two to join you. Explore your city \nYou might be amazed by the stuff you find out about the city you live in. Jump in the car and take a drive. Or get on your bike and roam. Break away from your normal hangouts and get to know your city better. Look for abandoned buildings, historical areas, or areas rich with culture. You might even make a new discovery. Add to the fun: Don’t forget your camera (or phone) to document your exploration. Create your own documentary and post it on YouTube. Arts and crafts/DIY project \nWhether it’s accessories, adding a little something extra to your clothing, home décor, or one big book to compile a bunch of memories in, spring break is your chance to get creative and jazz things up a bit. There may not be much you can master in just a week, but you can spend your spring break giving things a try. Start small — it’s all about life hacks right now. Might I suggest starting with the food hacks. It’s college, I think we can all appreciate any advice we can get on how to make cooking fun, quick, and super easy. Add to the fun: Invite some friends over to learn together or show them how you’ve become a life hack master this spring break. Couples Therapy \nFinally, this one is for the couples. Valentine’s Day might be over, but that doesn’t mean the romance has to end. Take a few days this week to just relax with your significant other. Get to know each other better. Rekindle the romance, or find a way to keep the fire burning even stronger. And if by some chance you attend different colleges and you can’t take spring break at the same time, you can take turns being the romantic during your week off. Add to the fun: Celebrate your relationship in some way everyday this week. Whether the gestures are big or small they’ll be appreciated.
