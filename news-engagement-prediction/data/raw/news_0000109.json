It is understood that the socialist group is also sending a letter, but a spokesman declined to comment.\nMalloch, a businessman, who stridently supported Brexit ahead of the vote in June, is said to have been interviewed for the post by Trump.\nWhen recently asked by the BBC why he was interested in moving to Brussels, Malloch replied: “I had in a previous career a diplomatic post where I helped bring down the Soviet Union. So maybe there’s another union that needs a little taming.” \nHe also said that Donald Trump was not a fan of the EU, described it as “supranational and unelected” and attacked the European commission’s president, Jean-Claude Juncker. “Mr Juncker was a very adequate mayor I think of some city in Luxembourg, and maybe he should go back and do that again,” he said.\nTrump's focus on UK trade could sideline EU, Democrats fear Read more \nManfred Weber, leader of the centre-right EPP and an ally of the German chancellor Angela Merkel, and Guy Verhofstadt, who leads the liberal ALDE group, accuse Malloch of “outrageous malevolence” towards “the values that define this European Union”.\nIn a letter seen by the Guardian, Weber and Verhofstadt address the president of the European commission and the president of the European council, Donald Tusk: “In the past weeks, Ted R. Malloch, the likely nominee by US President Trump to become the new US ambassador to the European Union , made a series of public statements denigrating the EU.\n“In these statements, the prospective nominee expressed his ambition to ‘tame the bloc like he brought down the Soviet Union’, eloquently supported dissolution of the European Union and explicitly bet on the demise of the common currency within months. \n“These statements reveal outrageous malevolence regarding the values that define this European Union and, if pronounced by an official representative of the United States, they would have the potential to undermine seriously the transatlantic relationship that has, for the past 70 years, essentially contributed to peace, stability and prosperity on our continent.”\nIt is understood that a letter drafted by the socialist leader Gianni Pittella, to be sent to the European council and European commission, is equally hard-hitting.\nFor a nominated ambassador to the EU to receive accreditation as head of a mission in Brussels, that person requires the approval of the Commission and the European council along with the member state and the European External Action Service, which is akin to a foreign office.\nThe leaders, who make up a significant majority in the European parliament, add: “We are strongly convinced that persons seeing as their mission to disrupt or dissolve the European Union, should not be accredited as official representatives to the EU.\n“On behalf of our political groups in the European parliament, we urge you not to accept the accreditation credentials of Mr Malloch, should he be proposed as US Ambassador to the EU.”\nCommenting on the letter, Verhofstadt, who is also the European parliament’s chief Brexit negotiator, said: “Mr Malloch has made a series of public statements denigrating the EU, which threaten to undermine our traditionally strong relationship with the United States. The last thing we need in Europe is more nationalism, exported by the Trump administration . We demand that his accreditation is rejected.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T23:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T19:02:30.427+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
