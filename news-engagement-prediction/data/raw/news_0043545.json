It was McCall’s fifth fight in a row to be canceled and eight in the last three years. McCall was transported to the hospital to be treated for gastrointestinal issues and ended up remaining in New York for medical reasons. Since then, McCall hasn’t spoke much about what transpired in the hours between weigh-ins and fight time, but this weekend he went on Joe Rogan’s podcast where he detailed the event and his illness, saying the weight cut was the best of his career, until it wasn’t. “I’ve never made weight that easy in my entire career. You ask anybody, usually you stop drinking water 24 hours out from weigh-ins. I cut weight Thursday night and it was going so well that I had five glasses of ice water throughout the night. So then I figured I could eat a little bit. So I tried to eat a little bit of salad and I threw that up. But I figured that was just the dressing or something messing my stomach up. So I had at least a cup of almonds, about five cups of water, I cut the rest in the morning and then when I was trying to gain weight back my body wouldn’t. I couldn’t hold on to anything. I kept throwing up everything... “By the next morning, I had still only gained five pounds. Everything I tried to eat, I threw up. And I was throwing up in front of all the other fighters. Every single chance we ended up having to be in a group in public, I ended up f**king throwing up.” But despite the fact that he was obviously very ill, McCall still intended to fight on Saturday until UFC officials told him it was off. Instead, McCall was transported to the hospital where, for a moment, it looked like he was in serious danger though it ultimately turned out alright. “I asked them, I’m like. ‘Listen, just let me fight...’ And they looked at me like, ‘No dude, you need to go to the hospital.’ Then they were gonna do emergency gallbladder surgery which they didn’t have to do thank god. This whole thing scared the s**t out of me. When the doctor says, ‘Oh well you could die, you never know,’ I’m like, what the f**k do you mean you never know?” As for what was actually the issue, McCall still doesn’t have any answers. He believes it may be related to the weight cut or to the illness which removed him from his UFC Fight Night 99 bout with Neil Seery but the doctors are still running tests. But at the end day, McCall says it was just his body failing him. “[My gallbladder] was super shrunk - contracted. I guess [from the dehydration]. And then they saw shadowing and some other stuff [on the tests] and they thought I had gall stones... Then they did a more advanced version of the ultrasound and they didn’t see anything so they didn’t have to do [surgery]. So basically we’re just running tests, been running tests all week. “I’m still skinny. I went home a day later than I was supposed to go home and I was still under 135 pounds - 132 pounds. I wasn’t able to hold food down until Tuesday. My body just f**kin’ failed me.” MUST-READ STORIES", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:13:41.765+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
