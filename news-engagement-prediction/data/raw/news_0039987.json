(Photo: MICHAEL REYNOLDS, EPA) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nSAN FRANCISCO — This week an estimated 40,000 attendees are crowding RSA, one of the nation's largest computer security conferences. But one group has stayed away — officials from the Trump administration. \n\"There's been a noticeable absence of government security officials at RSA this year,\" said J.J. Thompson, CEO of Rook Security in Indianapolis, Indiana. \nIn past years, the Obama administration was very engaged at RSA, in keynotes and panels. High- and low-ranking staff put out its views on cybersecurity, called for experts in the field to come work for the government to protect the homeland and were outspoken about the issues raised by encryption and the dangers of terrorists going dark through its use. \nWhile there were 41 government speakers at RSA this year, there are no senior level speakers from the Trump administration. \n“It’s disappointing not to see a greater administration presence here,” said Bruce McConnell, vice president of the EastWest Institute and former Department of Homeland Security deputy undersecretary for cybersecurity. \nRSA said that at the time its program was finalized, many of the new administration’s appointments were not selected. Invitations were extended to several of the new appointments, but based on schedules and event timing, they were unable to speak at this year’s conference, RSA said in a statement to USA TODAY. \nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment. \nOne reason the lack of participation has been noted is that the Trump administration was widely expected to release its executive order on cybersecurity during RSA. \n\"Everybody was holding their breath for the White House executive order, and they were cautiously optimistic that it would be good news for cybersecurity,\" said Thompson. \nWith no indication the executive order will be released this week, that expectation is waning. \nWhile the absence of administration representatives contrasts with last year, it's difficult to judge how it compares to the situation the last time the White House changed occupants. \nIn 2009, the RSA conference itself and computer security in general, were smaller and less of national interest and therefore less well attended by staff from all branches of government. \n\"To be honest, I wasn't expecting anyone to be here. People are still getting up to speed and you could have problems if someone was on a panel and got a question they didn't know the policy answer to,\" said Ryan O'Leary, a security researcher with WhiteHat Security who has attended multiple RSA conferences. \nThis year the highest government voice was from the legislative branch, House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Texas), who gave one of the opening day keynote talks on Tuesday. \nHe called the state of the nation’s cybersecurity bleak. \n“I’m going to be brutally honest. We are in the fight of our digital lives and we are not winning,” he said. \nHe told the audience “there’s no doubt in my mind” that the Russian government tried to undermine the 2016 presidential election, and he said the country does not have the infrastructure to combat cyber threats. \n“Our laws have not kept up with this new digital age,” he said. “Today the United States government is fighting 21st-century threats with 20th-century technology and a 19th-century bureaucracy.” CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2lbbvVw NEVER MISS OUT Tech Be the earliest adopter.
