And when she performed at the Academy Awards last year, she surrounded herself with young people identified as survivors of sexual assault. \nNow she’s preparing for a gig — and a platform — bigger than any other: the halftime show at Sunday’s Super Bowl , which she’ll headline before an estimated television audience of more than 100 million viewers. \nBut how to make use of this closely watched moment? \nLady Gaga certainly has things to say about LGBT rights and the plight of the marginalized. And she’s certainly known for saying them — albeit in settings (like a Hollywood awards show) generally sympathetic to progressive causes. \nYet the Super Bowl is a different proposition, as Beyoncé found out last year when her halftime performance of the black-pride anthem “Formation” inspired a conservative backlash. \nFor some, America’s highest-profile football game — a locus of so-called traditional values — wasn’t the place to express such an idea. \nThat view is sure to be even more widely held this year. The U.S. seems particularly polarized in the wake of Donald Trump ’s election and his tumultuous first two weeks as president. \nRead the full story:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T07:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T02:33:39.195+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
