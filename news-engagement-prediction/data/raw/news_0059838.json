He was in Bathinda a day after Vipin, a ground staffer with the IAF at the Bhisiana station here, was found to have been murdered allegedly by his paramour, her husband and her brother, and his body cut up and stuffed into 16 polythene bags. \nWhile police says it’s a case of an extra-marital affair gone wrong, the family allege “foul play”. Vipin, who has two kids with his wife, is a native of Beninagar village of Gonda district of Uttar Pradesh. He had joined the IAF in 2009 and was posted at Bhisiana station in May 2014. \nAlso read | Air force sergeant murders colleague, hides chopped-up body in polythene bags \nHe was missing since February 8, after which a search by police and the IAF led to the living quarters of accused Sulesh Kumar, an IAF sergeant, his wife Anuradha, and her brother Shashi Bhushan.

She, in turn, has said he was forcing her to continue with the affair despite her unwillingness. Police say that Anuradha hatched the conspiracy, and Sulesh called Vipin to their quarters on the pretext of help in packing some household articles on February 8 evening. That is when the murder was committed with an axe, and the body hacked with a meat cleaver for discreet disposal. \nMeanwhile, based on a complaint by his wife Kumkum, a case for kidnapping was registered against unknown persons at Nathana police station on February 15. Superintendent of police (SP) Gurmeet Singh said a team of the police and station officials were conducting a search on Tuesday when foul smell emanating from the quarters of Sulesh was observed.

However, the doctors shifted the body to Government Medical College and Hospital at Faridkot. \nSulesh and Anuradha have already been arrested while Shashi is on the run. \nTwo-day remand \nMeanwhile, the Bathinda police got two-day remand of the two arrested accused, to recover the weapon used in the murder besides collecting other clues. \nDeputy superintendent of police Kuldeep Singh Sohi said the police had sought seven-day custody. “We are yet to recover the weapon used in crime, while teams have been dispatched to Uttar Pradesh to nab the third accused, Shashi Bhushan,” Sohi added. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:14:55.821+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
