Those decisions would instead be left up to state and local officials under the Trump administration's directive. \nThe Obama administration said Title IX, the civil rights law that protects students from sex discrimination in schools that receive federal funding, guarantees those protections to transgender students. \nTrump administration overturns Obama-era transgender bathroom guidance \nBut despite the change, Kaplan said provisions included in the Obama administration guidance aren't dead just yet. \nHe pointed to an upcoming U.S. Supreme Court case where a transgender student in Virginia sued his school district for refusing to let him use the boy's bathroom. Whether Title IX extends to transgender students is a central question in that case, which is scheduled to come before the court next month, Kaplan said. \n\"Even with revoking the guidance, it doesn't undo legal protections for trans students,\" he said. \"Trans students are clearly protected by the Constitution, and there's a line of case law showing that Title IX ... protects trans students.\" \nThe Trump administration's decision was announced Wednesday night by U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. She said the guidance has \"given rise to several legal questions,\" and has not been enforced since a federal judge in August temporarily blocked the guidance. The Obama administration's appeal of that ruling was later dropped by the Trump administration. \nStephanie White, executive director of Equality Michigan, an LGBTQ advocacy group, said overturning the Obama administration guidance sends a signal that the Trump administration doesn't support equality for the transgender community. \n\"It's a callous move that doesn't actually change the law,\" she said. \"If they repeal the guidance, Title IX still exists. We still have the U.S. Constitution. We still have civil rights protections under Title IX.\" \nReport: Betsy DeVos squares off with Jeff Sessions over transgender bathroom directive \nA letter from the U.S. Department of Education outlining the change said dropping the Obama administration guidance \"does not leave students without protections from discrimination, bullying, or harassment. All schools must ensure that all students, including LGBT students, are able to learn and thrive in a safe environment.\" \n\"We are encouraged that she was able to include that passage,\" White said, \"and we're interested to see what that means in practice.\" \nThe issue of transgender student access to restrooms and locker rooms has been a heavily debated throughout the U.S. in recent years. The topic generated significant controversy in Michigan last year when the State Board of Education approved voluntary guidelines similar to those established by the Obama administration. \nThe legal basis for the State Board guidelines pertaining to transgender bathroom use were grounded in the Obama administration's legal interpretation of Title IX, the guidelines say. \nBut just because the Obama administration's legal interpretation of the law has been dropped doesn't mean the State Board will alter its guidelines, said Casandra Ulbrich, co-president of the board. \n\"At this time, I don't see a majority of the board supporting turning back,\" said Ulbrich, speaking prior to the Trump administration's official announcement but after news reports made clear the administration was moving in that direction. \nShe added: \"I think there was support on the board to move in this direction, to provide the guidance that the local districts were asking for, and I don't necessarily see a reason at this point to revisit that.\" \nRichard Zeile, the board's other co-president, who voted against the guidelines, could not immediately be reached for comment Wednesday. \nMichigan joins federal lawsuit over transgender bathroom directive \nOne educator contacted Wednesday by MLive.com said rescinding the Obama administration guidance was a \"common sense\" move. \nRockford Public Schools Superintendent Michael Shibler said his district provides gender neutral bathrooms at its high school and will work with students and families to provide alternative locker room accommodations for transgender students. \nBut Shibler said he does not permit transgender students to use a group restroom or locker room that doesn't match the sex the student was assigned at birth. \n\"I have an absolute responsibility to protect the safety and wellbeing of all of our students,\" said Shibler, whose district is north of Grand Rapids. \nState Rep. Gary Glenn, R-Midland, who was a vocal critic of the State Board's decision to adopt the LGBT guidance, said he's pleased to \"see our federal government return to a reality based policy.\" \n\"I think the obvious and compassionate solution to these types of situations, especially in a public schools setting, is to provide a private changing room or restroom for any child who suffers from an obvious psychological disorder of this type rather than force the 99 percent of students who don't suffer this type of disorder to be confronted with it in a way that violates their privacy,\" he said.
