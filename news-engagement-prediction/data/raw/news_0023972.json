In two early mock drafts put together by NFLDraftScout.com analysts Rob Rang and Dane Brugler, Garrett was projected to go to the Browns. \nAlthough the top pick has skipped the draft before, it doesn't happen often. If Garrett does go No. 1 overall, he would be following in the footsteps of Jameis Winston (2015). However, before that, a top pick skipping out on the draft hadn't happened since 1994 when Ohio State's Dan Wilkinson went No. 1 overall to the Bengals . \nDuring his interview with the Chronicle , Garret did say that at least one person is still trying to talk him into attending, so there's an outside shot that he could change his mind over the next two months. However, as things stand now, Goodell will likely be spending the first few minutes of the draft all alone on stage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T05:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:30:37.482+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
