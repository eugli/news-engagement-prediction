Stephanie Davis and Jeremy McConnell (Photo: Ian West/PA Wire) \nThey fell in love on the show, despite Steph having a boyfriend at the time, and they continued dating on the outside world until things turned sour a few months later. \nSteph soon found out she was pregnant but at the time, Jeremy said it wasn’t true.

Baby Caben-Albi (Photo: Stephanie Davis/Instagram) \nIt comes after Stephanie Davis deleted any trace of the statement she put out after her ex took the DNA test. \nFollowing the This Morning segment, during which Jeremy opened up about not being there for Steph throughout her pregnancy, the ex-Hollyoaks star had tweeted a statement about Jez’s treatment of her. \nShe said she felt “humiliated” by the way in which Jeremy demanded to know whether he was the father of her newborn baby, Caben-Albi, and said he had ruined her pregnancy. \n“Stephanie has felt humiliated by Jeremy denying his own son and foolishly announcing publicly his request for a DNA test,” the statement read. \n“Jeremy has caused Stephanie massive amounts of stress, pressure and upset throughout her pregnancy, ruining what for most women is one of the most special time[s] of their lives.” Stephanie Davis and her baby boy Caben-Albi George (Photo: OK! magazine) \nIt went on: “Jeremy has at no point throughout the pregnancy or birth been in contact directly with Stephanie. Jeremy was categorically not banned from the birth, nor did he ever ask to attend. \n“Jeremy has been given the option at all times to take part in a DNA test, because of past behaviour Stephanie has requested that this is handled via the correct channels and managed by her solicitor. \nThe statement also brought up Jeremy’s “audacity” at turning the situation “into a media circus” and accused him of trying to handle it “on his terms only”. \nBut Steph has since taken down the statement, plus screengrabs of a previous tweet posted by Jeremy that denied it was his baby. \nShe is yet to comment on Jeremy’s public statements about the tot.
