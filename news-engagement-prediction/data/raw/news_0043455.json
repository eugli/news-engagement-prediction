It’s a significant moment as Kolisi becomes the first black African to lead the Cape Town-based franchise in the 20th year of its existence‚ marking a milestone for the union. \nIt’s also a significant shift from the co-captaincy between Juan de Jongh and Frans Malherbe that coach Robbie Fleck attempted in 2016. \nThere is clearly a plan in place to mould a team around the personalities of Kolisi‚ Fleck and Etzebeth. Kolisi has earned 76 caps for the Stormers since making his debut in 2012 and will be ably assisted by his good friend Etzebeth. \nBoth players have come through the structures of Western Province Rugby since attending the Western Province Rugby Institute in 2010‚ along with the likes of Frans Malherbe‚ Nizaam Carr and Scarra Ntubeni who are all still their teammates. \nStormers Head Coach Robbie Fleck said that Kolisi would be well supported by a strong core of senior players within the squad as they tackle a demanding 2017 Super Rugby campaign. \n\"We have developed a number of strong leaders in this group‚ so Siya will certainly not be shouldering the responsibility on his own‚ but we felt it important to appoint someone who the team can rally around‚” Fleck said. \n\"Although still quite young‚ Siya is already an experienced player who has matured both on and off the field and is one of the most popular and respected players in our squad.” \"There have been some great players who have led the Stormers out at Newlands‚ so for me to be amongst them is both a great privilege and a great responsibility‚” Kolisi said. \n\"With the support of Eben and the rest of the senior players in the squad I am confident that we can create something special that our fans can be proud of.” \n- TMG Digital", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:49:40.581+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
