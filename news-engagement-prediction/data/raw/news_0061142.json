They discussed Kasich's ideas for overhauling President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, a pressing priority for Trump and the U.S. Congress.\nAsked if he had buried the hatchet with Trump, Kasich told reporters after the meeting that he wanted Trump to succeed and would agree with him on some occasions and would speak out when he does not.\n\"The man is the president of the United States. It's sort of like being on an airplane. You want to root for the pilot. If you’re on the airplane with the pilot, you don’t want the pilot to screw up,\" Kasich said.\nKasich said he stressed with Trump the importance of his administration speaking with one voice, saying he had attended the Munich Security Conference in Germany recently and heard concerns about Trump's policies despite reassurances given by Vice President Mike Pence.\n(Reporting By Steve Holland; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:04:17.586+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
