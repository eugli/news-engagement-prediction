For Monday’s segment, the host didn’t have to do anything so radical, considering he found a way to touch on a plethora of Trump topics, including a recent visit by Chris Christie, the hunt for a new national security adviser after Michael Flynn’s resignation, and a confusing comment about Sweden during a rally in Florida on Saturday. After listing several European cities that have been attacked by terrorists, Trump mentioned Sweden, where in reality, no terrorist attack occurred Friday night. “We’ve got to keep our country safe,” Trump said. “You look at what’s happening in Germany, you look at what’s happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this?” \nMeyers played a clip from the rally and said, “As he does so often, Trump transitioned seamlessly from claiming the media makes up fake stories to making up his own fake stories. … Who would believe this? The answer is no one because, as fact checkers pointed out, no incident occurred in Sweden on Friday night.” \nTrump later said he was referring to a debunked report he had seen on Fox News about violence allegedly perpetrated by refugees in Sweden. But his comments, which spurred comparisons to Kellyanne Conway’s repeated references to the fictitious Bowling Green Massacre , were mocked on Twitter, including by the Swedish government. \n“That’s how bad things have gotten under Trump; we’re getting roasted by Swedes now,” added Meyers. “The Swedish Chef is like, ‘Dude, even I don’t understand a word you’re saying.’” \nLate Night airs on NBC at 12:35 a.m. ET.
