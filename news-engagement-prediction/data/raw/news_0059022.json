Abrams and reigning master of horror Stephen King . It's called Castle Rock and it will be spooky as hell, and that's about all they're telling us for now. Here's the trailer: \nFor laymen, this is an unspectacular video. No casting announcements, no footage. For those a little familiar with King's canon, though, there's already a lot here to get excited about. EDITORâ€™S PICK The Welcome Return of James Franco the Actor \nCastle Rock, Maine, is a fictional town featured in many of King's books and short stories. Sometimes as the setting, sometimes just in passing. Almost his entire career, King has been laying connections and through-lines between his stories. Castle Rock is a natural response, and evolution to that. It will be an anthology show, borrowing characters and plots from some of King's most famous books, but will be entirely its own originally written beast, not beholden to any one adaptation or narrative. \nCastle Rock, the town, is perhaps best known as the setting for Needful Things , Kings' terrifying (naturally) story about a sinister, mysterious antiques shop and its proprietor. It's also the setting for Cujo , everyone's favorite, irredeemably evil literary puppy. Birth.Movies.Death., the gold standard for nerd movie content, has a full rundown of every King reference in the teaser, if you're so inclined . \nIt seems like Castle Rock is being formed as almost a Stephen King sandbox anthology series. Maybe Needful Things will be the main thrust of a season, but that won't mean Danny Torrance or Pennywise not dropping in for some reason. If executed well, this could be an exciting extension of King's writing and world-building, rather than a cynical perversion of it. \nAn Abrams/King/Hulu collaboration isn't without precedent. The three were responsible for 11/22/63 last year, based on King's novel. The show itself was good but hampered by timid performances and an unwillingness to follow through on some of King's more interesting ideas from the book. It's hard now not to see the series (itself featuring a passing Castle Rock reference or two) as almost a backdoor tester pilot for this new project. \nAs of right now there's no news on who'll be actually making this show, nor any casting announcements. Production is set to begin sometime this year. Until then, I dunno, go read some Stephen King books. You've got the time.
