He can’t have any type of recording devices like a camera or video recorder. He must not attend any area where children under 16 could be present like parks, schools, swinging pools, playgrounds or a daycare. \nSchnell has hired defence lawyer Greg White. \nHe will be back in court for his next appearance March 24. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T06:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T02:20:24.996+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
