Our guess is that the new season picks up right where Season 4 left off, with Daya Diaz ( Dascha Polanco ) pointing a loaded gun at two of the prison guards during a riot following the death of Poussey ( Samira Wiley ). \nNetflix also released a short teaser for the new season, though aside from highlighting several of the main characters, including Piper ( Taylor Schilling ), Nicky ( Natasha Lyonne ) and Daya with that gun in hand, it doesn't give fans much to go on. Look for a more fleshed-out trailer to be released in the coming weeks. \nPer usual, all 13 episodes of Season 5 will be released simultaneously on June 9.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T21:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T17:55:22.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
