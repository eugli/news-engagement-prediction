An operation to force Daesh from the west of the city began days ago. © AP Photo/ Matt Dunham 'Overreacting': What's Wrong With 'Mad Dog' Mattis' 'Position of Strength' Remark on Russia \nSenior US commander in Iraq Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend joined Mattis for his remarks. He commented that he did not expect US troops to be asked to leave the country after the battle for Mosul was over. \n\"I think that the government of Iraq realizes their very complex fight, and they're going to need the assistance of the coalition even beyond Mosul.\" \nTownsend also confirmed that US forces are moving closer to the battlefront as the operation to retake western Mosul kicks off. \"It is true that we're operating closer and deeper into Iraqi formations,\" Townsend said, acknowledging a shift approved in November, during the end of the Obama administration. \nUS military personnel had largely maintained positions well behind the front lines since returning to Iraq in 2014, but after the battle to retake Mosul launched in October, the administration moved to allow US trainers and advisers to move closer to the battlefield for the operation, the New York Times reports. \nLieutenant General Jeff Harrigian, the top Air Force commander in the Middle East, told AP that US troops responsible for calling in airstrikes are now closer to the battle and are able to advance with Iraqi units. They can now speak directly to pilots in the aircraft they're directing, making airstrikes quicker, he said. \nMattis's trip was the first by a senior Trump administration official to Iraq. One of Trump's first acts as president was to order a 30-day review of the state of the fight against Daesh. There is one more week left in the review period, after which Mattis will have to give the president a plan to speed up the fight against the group. © AFP 2016/ Dimitar DILKOFF Asked in a news conference if the country was worried the US would indeed come for its oil, spokesman for Iraq's counter-terrorism services Sabeh Al Noman said, \"We will trust your government, so we won't worry about that.\" \nThere are more than 5,000 US military personnel in Iraq. ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T05:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:43:14.825+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
