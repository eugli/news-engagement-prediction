We believe there is a need to bring the events in Quebec City into the conversation as we all – schools and the community – reflect and act on shaping a better tomorrow.” \nFortunately, or in some ways unfortunately, Powers-Dunlop said, teachers are getting good at talking to students about terrible news. \n“After a while, you see the same key message: listen, be empathetic, show sympathy, use it as a teachable moment, limit exposure to media if people are really upset and use it to teach about inclusivity and respect for different people.” \nOren Amitay, a family psychologist, said the worst thing parents and teachers can do is avoid discussing tragedies. \n“From around seven years old, there’s a good chance the child will be hearing something about this,” Amitay said. \n“What parents and teachers have to realize when a child has an inkling of something, they can spin it into some narrative a parent would never expect. Because they’re kids, the narrative is usually self focused – I’m next to die.” \nREAD MORE: Quebec City mosque shooting: Alexandre Bissonnette charged with 6 counts of 1st degree murder \nAmitay suggests teaching children and teens “to focus on the here and now.” \nIf your children are worried about anti-Muslim rhetoric, and there’s a Muslim kid in their school, tell them ‘don’t be a social justice warrior, just be cool with them,’ Amitay suggested. \n“Tell them to act a certain way, like they would with their friends.” \nJudy Wiener, a clinical psychologist and a professor at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, said teachers and parents have a responsibility to talk to children about the issues of race, bigotry and intolerance. \n“This attack can be used in a positive way to expand horizons and help kids understand, but at the same time also acknowledging that this is really serious and distressing,” Wiener said. \n“I’m really worried about the student, parent or teacher who won’t talk about this. Of course it’s difficult, but they ought to be aware of this and grappling with it.” © 2017 The Canadian Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T00:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:01:29.526+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
