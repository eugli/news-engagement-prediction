(PTI image) Deepa Jayakumar, the niece of J Jayalalithaa, is likely to launch her political party today even as people and politicos across Tamil Nadu on Friday led the nation in paying rich tributes to late Chief Minister of the state on her 69th birth anniversary. According to media reports, Deepa is eager to launch her political outfit and has decided not to go with former Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam. A few days ago, however, she had said that she was ready to work with Panneerselvam in the future. When asked if it was her official entry into politics, Jayakumar said,” Yes, it is.” It will be interesting to see what eventually spans out.\nChief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami will launch a massive 69 lakh seedling planting initiative today. He will launch the initiative at the Tamil Nadu Government Multi Super Speciality Hospital Campus in Chennai, according to a report. He will also launch a ‘Massive Greening Programme’ in the cyclone Vardah affected areas. In the past too, massive tree plantation drives had been taken up by the state government on Jayalalithaa’s birth anniversary. She had passed away on December 5, 2016.
