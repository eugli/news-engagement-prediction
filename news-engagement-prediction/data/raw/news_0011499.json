His father was a merchant captain, and at age 14 Raffles entered the service of the East India Company as a clerk.\nHe educated himself in science and languages, and aged 25 was appointed Assistant Secretary to the government of Penang â€“ an island in the Malacca Strait off Malaya.\nAfter coming to the attention of Lord Minto, and helping to weaken Franco-Dutch influence in the region, Raffles was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Java.\nThroughout his time in the east, he studied the natural history, peoples, and languages of the places he spent time, amassing large collections of artefacts. However, his work for the benefit of the Javanese people earned him the disapproval of the East India Company, and he was recalled when Lord Minto died.\nRaffles landed on a largely barren island off southern Malaya. It was controlled by the Shah of Johor, who was friendly to the Dutch. B ack in London, Raffles was made a fellow of the Royal Society and knighted, before setting out east again.\nKeen to supplant the Dutch as the dominant western regional power, he convinced Lord Hastings, Governor General of India, that Britain needed a fortified post further east.\nOn 29 January 1819 Raffles landed on a largely barren island off southern Malaya. It was controlled by the Shah of Johor, who was friendly to the Dutch.\nAfter replacing the Shah with his older brother, Raffles signed a treaty with the new Shah on 6 February 1819. It permitted the British to found a colonial trading port on the island. Modern Singapore was born.\nRaffles returned to London, where he won respect as an expert in Malayan civilisation. He set up the Zoological Society of London, and was appointed its first president. He died in July 1826.\nIn 1963 Singapore joined the Federation of Malaysia, and on 9 August 1965 it seceded to become an independent state. It is now the largest port in southeast Asia, with thriving financial and industrial sectors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T17:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T12:37:10.136+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
