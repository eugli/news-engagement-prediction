The other color that I was surprised to see was the number of rich browns.” \n  \nThe unsettled mood of today’s world also affects our color choices. Right now, earth tones are popular as stress relievers. \nBut the top color for 2018 is violet verbena, better known as purple. Well, kind of a grayish purple. But color styling manager Allison Heape says cell phone owners are almost impossible to predict. \n“Somebody that’s going to buy a silver cell phone, or a black cell phone, or that default basic cell phone, they might fit into a certain trend category. But there’s going to be another person who aligns with the pink cell phone, or the rose telephone,” she said. \nIt’s probably best to play it safe it safe – with violet verbena. \nSchlotter says they can’t reveal what next year’s color trends will be, but she admitted to the “KDKA Morning News” they’ll be “less edgy.” \n“I can tell you that the colors for next year will be more faded than this year and that’s all from our need to get in spaces that make us relaxed and get away from a lot of the chatter of the outside world,” says Schlotter. \nSchlotter adds the color experts visiting are “loving the city,” and that they are impressed by the food choices Pittsburgh has to offer.
