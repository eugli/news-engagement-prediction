Previously, under Barack Obama 's administration, students were allowed to use whichever restroom corresponded to their identified sex. \nOn Thursday, the I Am Cait star — who supported Trump over opponent Hillary Clinton in the last election — took to Instagram to reveal her thoughts about the new provisions… and she is PISSED! \nRelated: Caitlyn Gets Some Birthday Love From Her Famous Family \nThe athlete begins by offering encouraging words to transgender youth everywhere, saying: \n\"I have a message for the trans kids of America. You are winning. I know it doesn't feel that way today or every day, but you _ are _ winning. You are going to keep on winning so much you're going to get sick of winning. Very soon, we'll win full freedom nationwide, and it's going to happen with bipartisan support. For all our friends out there, If you want to be part of this winning side, you can help by checking out the National Center for Trans Equality and letting Washington hear how you feel loud and clear.\" \nHowever, the reality TV personality also has a VERY strong message for the haters, including some not-so-subtle shade thrown at Jeff Sessions : \n\"Now…I also have a message for the bullies. You suck. You're losers and you're going to keep on losing. Because you're weak, you pick on kids or you pick on women or anyone you think is vulnerable. Apparently even becoming the Attorney General isn't enough to cure some of you of your insecurity. As proof that you can't stop our progress, the Supreme Court will soon hear an important Title Nine case thanks to the courage of a brave young man named Gavin Grimm . See you in court!\" \nOn March 28, the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear Gavin's case, where he is suing his school for barring him from using the boys' restroom. \nTo hear Caitlyn's personal message to Donald, ch-ch-check out the clip (below)!
