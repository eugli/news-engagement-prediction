The Daily Mail has a swath of exclusive pictures, but you should only need one, maybe two to see that Vikander is off to a running, jumping, climbing start on her role as Lara Croft: \nIt's been said by cast and crew that the new Tomb Raider film would follow in the steps of the 2013 reboot game , but this is downright uncanny. If nothing else, this may end up being one of the most faithful video game to film adaptations yet. \nDirected by Roar Uthaug and starring Alicia Vikander, Walton Goggins, Daniel Wu, and Dominic West, Tomb Raider will open in cinemas on March 16, 2018. \nSeen something newsworthy? ! \nImages: Warner Bros / Noble & Draper ABOUT THE AUTHOR Sam has a soft spot for MOBAs, MMOs, and emo music.
