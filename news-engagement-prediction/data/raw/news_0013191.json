But of course. screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET \nA warning: The images in this article are graphic. \nToday in \"What Would You Have Done?\" we look at the case of a teenager who befell a tragedy. \nEighteen-year-old Julia Pechar has a messy room. She wanted the world to know what can happen if your room is so messy that you can't see where you're stepping. \nThis she did shortly after impaling herself on an iPhone charger. \nShe took to Twitter on Tuesday with three pictures. One showed her messy room. The other two showed the charger impaled in her foot. \nYou might be glad that the latter two images are smaller than the first. You might wish that she hadn't posted the latter two at all. \nThe modern world, though, is all about gruesome self-exposure. \nPechar didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about her current medical condition. Your mind, though, might have its own medical issue when I offer you the sequence of events here. \nThe Nebraska teen told BuzzFeed News that she was lying in bed watching Netflix when the microwave went off. \n\"I got so excited that I literally jumped off of my bed. I landed right on the charger,\" she said. \nThat is a hard landing. It's the next part, though, that's most moving. Her first instinct wasn't to cry for help.
