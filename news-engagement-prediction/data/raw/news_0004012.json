(Facebook/Canadian Press) \nJonathan Montpetit Quebec's growing far-right fringe faces scrutiny after the mosque attack \nAlexandre Bissonnette expressed fears during a Facebook exchange that the white race would be marginalized by immigration, the day before he was arrested in connection with the massacre at a Quebec City mosque, says a friend of the shooting suspect. \nCrown prosecutors charged Bissonnette with six counts of first-degree murder and five counts of attempted murder on Monday, but neither the Crown nor police have released any information about the suspect's motives. \nSuspect in mosque shooting called a moderate conservative turned extremist \nFormer classmates and friends have described Bissonnette as gradually developing far-right views, though many say they lost contact with him in the months before the shooting. \nHowever, Martin Robin, who met Bissonnette in 2014 at Laval University, said they interacted frequently on Facebook, including on the night before the shooting. \nDuring their online conversation that Saturday, Robin recalled asking his friend what he thought about U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to temporarily ban entry to travellers from seven predominantly Muslim countries. \nInside Quebec's far right: full coverage \n\"He told me he just wanted white immigration to Canada and Quebec, exclusively,\" Robin told CBC News on Friday. \n\"He told me that in the long run, this non-white, non-European immigration may perhaps lead to the marginalization of whites. That's pretty much what struck me and what keeps popping up in my mind.\" Martin Robin says he had a Facebook conversation with Bissonnette the night before the shooting. (Jonathan Montpetit/CBC) \nRobin showed CBC News his Facebook account and an exchange with someone called Alexandre Bissonnette. Only Robin's side of the conversation is visible. \nBissonnette's side reads: \"This message has been temporarily suppressed because the account of the sender requires verification.\" \nA Facebook account that is believed to have belonged to Bissonnette was removed from the social networking site just hours before he was formally charged on Monday. \nIn response to Bissonnette's alleged comments, Robin said he told his friend that he was \"crazy.\" Met police investigators \nSince Sunday's shooting, Robin has met with investigators from the Quebec provincial police and RCMP. He said they were seeking to find out if the suspect had received any support carrying out the attack. \n\"He had no help of any organization. Of that, I'm 100 per cent certain,\" Robin said of Bissonnette's alleged involvement. \nLegal observers have speculated that ties to an organization are a necessary condition for laying terrorism-related charges, which Bissonnette is not facing, so far. \nRobin also said he is good friends with Bissonnette's twin brother, Mathieu. The twins lived together in a Sainte-Foy apartment not far from the mosque Alexandre is accused of attacking. \nRobin said he also had a Facebook exchange with Mathieu Bissonnette on the weekend of the shooting. This image from Robin's Facebook account is part of his exchange with Bissonnette. The text highlighted in yellow reads, in French: 'This message has been temporarily suppressed because the account of the sender requires verification.' (Jonathan Montpetit) \nThey, too, discussed Trump's travel ban. Their exchange took place on Sunday night. \nAs the news began to circulate, Robin asked Mathieu if he had heard about the shooting, given the proximity of the mosque to his apartment. \nRead more about the victims of Quebec City mosque attack \n\"Yes, I saw it on the news,\" Mathieu Bissonnette replied. \"But it's not in front of my place. It's all quiet here.\" \nLater that night, Mathieu asked Robin if police knew \"who committed the crime.\" When it emerged the following day that Mathieu's brother had been arrested, Robin wrote to offer his support. \nMathieu did not reply. Robin said he has not heard from him since Sunday night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T08:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T04:20:22.595+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
