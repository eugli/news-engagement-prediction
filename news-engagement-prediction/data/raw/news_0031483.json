Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine was clearly second banana Friday (February 10) during his Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony after his 4-month-old daughter, Dusty Rose , made her first public appearance ‚Äî and owned it. \nWhile Levine was clearly stoked for his star , Dusty was too infatuated with all the cameras to take much notice. \"My tiny little cabbage patch kid found the camera today LOL,\" Levine's wife, model Behati Prinsloo , captioned on Instagram. \nBaby Dusty also had a blast stepping all over her dad's brand spankin' new star, because we all know she is the true star. Prinsloo 'grammed a similar pic and wrote, \"A very surreal and amazing day for our family. I'm so proud of all your accomplishments, but mostly I'm proud of the amazing person you are.
