This is a great deal for a phone of this capacity: the Honor 8 features a 5.2-inch display, the golden mean in smartphone screen sizes, it rocks a killer design with an innovative 15-layer glass back that looks stunning, and it sports a dual camera system on the back that captures very good looking pictures. The phone runs on a custom, HiSilicon chip that does well, but is not on the same level as flagship processors, and it features 32 GB of internal storage that can be expanded via microSD cards. And its battery life is also excellent. This particular V-Day promo for the Honor 8 includes a free 'clear TPU' plastic case and an accessories gift set, all for that $320 price. Honor will ship it for free and has a 15-day return policy in case you (or the person you are buying this for) don't like the phone. The phone also comes with a 1-year manufacturer warranty. Keep in mind that the Honor 8 only works on GSM carriers like AT&T and T-Mobile in the United States, but will not work on CDMA carriers like Verizon Wireless or Sprint.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T14:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T10:09:01.765+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
