Shane Battier (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 5:59 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 5:59 p.m. ET \nThe Miami Heat just got smarter. \nThursday, the team announced it's hired former NBA forward Shane Battier as Director of Basketball Development and Analytics. \nThe move reunites the Duke product with the franchise he spent the final three seasons of his 13-year career with. It also reconnects him with Heat lifer Erik Spoelstra, the film junkie head coach who began his career in the pro ranks as the team's film coordinator more than 20 years ago. Battier was a key member of Miami's back-to-back championship teams in the 2011-12 and 2012-13 seasons, as a rare '3 and D' guy who could be utilized as a \"stretch 4\" in Spoelstra's brand of positionless basketball. His 18 point-performance, on 6-for-8 shooting from behind the 3-point line, helped catapult the Heat to a Game 7 victory against the Spurs in the 2013 Finals. \nA two-time second-team selection to the NBA's All-Defensive team, Battier was tapped as the league's Teammate of the Year in 2014. \nMORE: Ranking every player in the 2017 NBA All-Star Game \nDuring his playing days, Battier used advanced statistics to shade opposing players to areas of the court where their shooting percentages were lowest, and, along with basketball savant LeBron James, devoured the coaches' version of the scouting report before games. \n\"Moneyball\" author Michael Lewis detailed Battier's unique value on the court, in a 2009 New York Times piece, \"The No-Stats All-Star.\" \nBattier’s game is a weird combination of obvious weaknesses and nearly invisible strengths. When he is on the court, his teammates get better, often a lot better, and his opponents get worse — often a lot worse. He may not grab huge numbers of rebounds, but he has an uncanny ability to improve his teammates’ rebounding. He doesn’t shoot much, but when he does, he takes only the most efficient shots. He also has a knack for getting the ball to teammates who are in a position to do the same, and he commits few turnovers. On defense, although he routinely guards the N.B.A.’s most prolific scorers, he significantly ­reduces their shooting percentages. At the same time he somehow improves the defensive efficiency of his teammates — probably, Morey surmises, by helping them out in all sorts of subtle ways. “I call him Lego,” Morey says. “When he’s on the court, all the pieces start to fit together. And everything that leads to winning that you can get to through intellect instead of innate ability, Shane excels in. I’ll bet he’s in the hundredth percentile of every category.” \n\nNBA trade rumors: Are the 76ers reconsidering getting rid of Jahlil Okafor? \nWatch his Big Think talk from 2015, \"How Analytics Made Me a Better Basketball Player.\" \n\"The way I look at it,\" Battier said. \"It's just another way, like honing your jump shot or honing your jump hook, to gain a competitive advantage on the basketball court.\" \nThe hire couldn't have come at a better time for the Heat (25-32), who started this season 11-30 before going on a league-best 13-game winning streak. Currently 10th in the Eastern Conference standings, Miami looks poised to make a strong push for the playoffs once the regular season reconvenes after the All-Star break. \nPlayers had better be ready to study up.
