STUDENT FOUND UNCONSCIOUS IN SCHOOL PASSED AWAY   Thu, 16/02/2017 - 5:19pm Advertisement \nFor the family of 15 year-old Bryan Chee, it seemed like a normal weekday. The boy had gone to school as per his usual routine and nothing seemed amiss. \nTragically, Chee was found unconscious at Loyang Secondary School in the afternoon on that fateful Wednesday, 15 February. \nThe Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) confirmed that it was alerted to a call for an ambulance at about 4.40PM that day, where they rushed an unconscious teenager to Changi General Hospital. He was later pronounced dead at the hospital. \nBryan Chee was an active student who loved basketball. However, according to Chee's father, the boy had a congenital heart defect and went for regular check ups. Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
