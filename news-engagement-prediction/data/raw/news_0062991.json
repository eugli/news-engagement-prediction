He took pictures with fans and talked to WXYZ and WJBK . \nWahlberg told FOX 2's Taryn Asher the plans are to open a restaurant somewhere in Taylor and one at 13 Mile and Woodward in Royal Oak . Asher says Wahlberg will be back in Detroit in a few weeks to make an official announcement. \n\"I've had wonderful experiences working here,\" Wahlberg told Asher. \"Such great hard working people. To be able to share my family experience with all of the people in Detroit and their families, it's a blessing.\" \nWahlberg also praised his work with Dan Gilbert and Gilbert's commitment to the city. \"I really have to give my friend Dan Gilbert, who's our landlord here, a lot of credit.
