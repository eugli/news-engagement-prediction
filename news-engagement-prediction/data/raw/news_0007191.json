Vince Ellis Detroit Free Press \nDetroit today became one of a dozen cities to submit an expansion application to join Major League Soccer. The league had set a Tuesday deadline for bid submissions as it seeks to add two expansion teams in 2020 and two more in 2022. \nMLS is seeking an expansion fee of $150 million for each of the teams selected for 2020. The league hasn't yet announced the expansion fee it will seek for 2022, but it's expected to be more than $150 million. \nDetroit’s bid is a joint venture between NBA owners Tom Gores and Dan Gilbert, who announced in April their plans for a $1-billion development at the downtown Wayne County Jail site that would include a 25,000-seat soccer-specific stadium. \n“I’m energized about what this opportunity means for the city and the region,” Gores said in a statement. “Detroit is rising, reinventing itself. I’m excited to partner with Dan and continue to play a role in Detroit’s resurgence.” \nRelated: Detroit to bid for Major League Soccer expansion team \n“Detroit sports fans are some of the most passionate in the world. No where else can you find as many major league teams in the urban core than in Detroit,” Gilbert said in the statement. “Since soccer is the most popular global sport, we also hope having an MLS team will put Detroit on the map with new audiences, attracting more visitors and more residents to the city.” \nOn Friday, the county announced it will try to restart the long-stalled jail project at Gratiot and St. Antoine, near Greektown. But on Monday, a statement attributed to Matt Cullen, head of Gilbert's Rock Ventures, says the Gilbert team is working to develop an offer for the jail site. \nMLS commissioner Don Garber has previously stated the jail site is the preferred location for a potential MLS stadium should Detroit be awarded an expansion team. \nThe applications were supposed to include details about plans for ownership, stadium and corporate and community support. \n“From pick-up to club to high school to the World Cup, I have been shaped by Detroit soccer,\" said Fox soccer analyst Alexi Lalas. \"I’m excited about the possibility of Major League Soccer coming to Detroit. There’s a vibrant and unique soccer culture and history in metro Detroit and Michigan. I think professional soccer, as a sport and business, fits in perfectly with the rebirth and growth of a city and area I know and love. This impressive and committed ownership group believes in the city and the sport, and the bright future of both.\" \nWhile the Detroit Sports Commission isn’t involved in the Gilbert/Gores project, it does support the idea of MLS coming to the region. The Detroit Sports Commission is a subsidiary of the Detroit Metro Convention & Visitors Bureau and tries to attract amateur, international and professional sporting events in metro Detroit. \n“Any time you can add another world-class venue to the downtown core and everything that’s already going on in the city, it provides a great opportunity to sell another event in another venue,” said Dave Beachnau, executive director of the Detroit Sports Commission. “I see it as definitely a positive. \n\"We're about promoting tourism and driving visitors through athletic and sports games that take place in the city.\" CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T05:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:48:19.659+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
