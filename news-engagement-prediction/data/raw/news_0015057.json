More than 1,500 were caged at Denbigh Asylum in north Wales (Photo: mediadrumworld.com) Read More Haunting photos capture decaying Amazonian-themed water park days before it is demolished \nThe 21-year-old, from Cockermouth, Cumbria, said: \"I try to capture the history and emotion of each place that I go to. I like to show the decay of a building which was once filled with life and how it has just been forgotten. \n\"I had heard many good things about this beautiful building and how I needed to see it before it comes crumbling to the ground.\" \nThe student's incredible footage captures a breathtaking bird's eye view of Denbigh.
