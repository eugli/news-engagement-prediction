Thanks to 400 times (!) the normal amount of estrogen coursing through your body, things that would never have bothered you pre-pregnancy are now enough to send you into a full-blown meltdown. On one level, you know it's crazy to cry over those Johnson & Johnson baby bath commercials. But on the other hand… babies! In baths! Making baby noises! And smiling at mommies! And puppies! Pass the tissues! Hormones are the worst.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below If you've ever found yourself in the midst of a pregnancy-induced irrational crying fit, know that you are so not alone.

I had all my groceries on the belt, but when it comes to my turn the checker looks at me and says, 'I'm going on my break, get in a different line.' I responded that her light was on when I got in line. She said, 'I don't care!' I told her I wanted to talk to a manager, and she said, 'I don't care!' I put all my stuff back in my cart and went into the next line. The other checker apologized profusely and called the manager.

One day, my husband texted that he was thinking of grabbing our family dinner from this place and asked what I wanted. I knew I had to have my milkshake and then added a couple sides and an entree so as to not look so desperate. He came home with everything but the milkshake because he didn't have enough hands to carry in the order and the milkshake. He didn't think it'd be a big deal until I had a full-blown temper tantrum.
