We do what is best for the people,” said Najib.\nHe added that a former leader had committed many mistakes in the handling of Proton. \n“I do not want to talk about it, but we want to fix it,” Najib said at the opening of the Negaraku: Komuniti 1Malaysia programme yesterday.\nIn his speech, he said fake news was a great threat to society and an all-out war must be waged against false information, propaganda and slander.\nHe said the Government had done many good things and yet these were always twisted into controversial issues through fake news.\nHe said this fake news was being spread through social media and by certain leaders with the political purpose of toppling the Govern­ment.\nNajib said that as proposed by Communications and Multimedia Minister Datuk Seri Dr Salleh Said Keruak, the war cry for this would be “Siap! (Ready!)”.\n“It means ready to receive orders from leaders. Orders must be obeyed.\n“Don’t let orders enter your right ear only to exit the left,” he reminded the crowd during the programme held at Taman Tasik Sultan Abu Bakar here.\nNajib also took potshots at a former leader, saying that the leader had opposed, supported then opposed the 1Malaysia People’s Aid (BR1M) again in the span of three months.\n“When you are not consistent, have different intentions and is not guided by truth, then this is just playing politics with the motive of toppling the Government. In the end, the people will see through your bluff.\n“He said we are giving citizenship to mainland Chinese who purchase homes in Johor when we have never even discussed this in the Cabinet,” he said.\nNajib added that he had been accused of selling away the sove­reignty of Malaysia to China when he had merely wanted to get more investments for the country.\n“King Salman is visiting us. What are they going to say? That we are selling our sovereignty to Saudi Arabia now? \n“People are here to invest so our economy can grow and more jobs can be created for Malaysians,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:39:00.965+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
