A police officer testified that after being detained Buck laughed and said, \"The bitch got what she deserved.\" \nClinical psychologist Walter Quijano, testifying as a defense witness on the likelihood of Buck committing future offenses, said black and Hispanic people are more likely to be dangerous because they are \"over-represented\" among violent offenders. \nWriting for the court, conservative Chief Justice John Roberts said the testimony was clearly prejudicial to Buck, even if it was only a small part of the proceeding. \n\"Some toxins are deadly in small doses,\" Roberts wrote. \nRoberts said the lower court's refusal to allow Buck to challenge his sentence was \"a disturbing departure from a basic premise of our criminal justice system: Our law punishes people for what they do, not who they are.\" \n\"Dispensing punishment on the basis of an immutable characteristic flatly contravenes this guiding principle,\" Roberts added. \nConservative justices Clarence Thomas, the court's only black member, and Samuel Alito dissented. \nDeath penalty opponents have pointed to statistics that show black defendants to be far more likely than white defendants to be sentenced to die, and argue that racial bias endures in the American criminal justice system and in death penalty cases in particular. \nBuck was seeking reversal of a 2015 ruling by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denying his request for an appeal. \nTexas in 2002 allowed six other death row inmates convicted in trials in which Quijano had given similar testimony to get new sentencing hearings but objected in Buck's case. \nAll six of the prisoners were again sentenced to death. \nThe office of the Texas Attorney General was not immediately available for comment. \n(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham) Next In U.S. Showdown looms for protesters near site of Dakota Access pipeline \nCANNON BALL, N.D.
