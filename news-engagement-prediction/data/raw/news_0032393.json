All I had to do was finish that training and I would be a firefighter today.” \nFDNY welcomes three more women to its ranks \nAdams, an Army and Air Force reservist, returned from a 2003 tour in Iraq determined to join the Bravest. When the FDNY gave an entrace exam in 2007, test number 6019, he signed up. \nWith his five military bonus points, Adams scored exceptionally well — landing at number 241 on the hiring list. \n“I showed my list number to a buddy of mine and he said, ‘Dude, you’re in.’ I remember thinking, ‘This is going to happen,’” the young father said. \nIndeed, it did happen — until he ripped a meniscus in his knee while training at the FDNY academy on Randalls Island. On the advice of his officers, Adams took a deferment to give himself time to heal. \nFirst woman picked to lead Vulcan Society \n“They told me I could come back in the very next class. They even kept all my stuff for me,” he said. “I never imagined that I’d never get back there again.” \nAdams was unaware that the city was embroiled in a long-running and antagonistic legal fight with the Vulcan Society, the FDNY’s fraternal association of black firefighters. The group had filed a federal complaint alleging disparate hiring practices — and the Department of Justice found compelling evidence of the Vulcans’ claims. \nUnder former Mayor Bloomberg, the city and the FDNY refused to negotiate with the DOJ and the Vulcans, and so a federal discrimination lawsuit followed.

Then the judge hearing the DOJ and the Vulcans’ case froze all department hiring until the suit was resolved — throwing the lives of the 6019 test-takers into chaos. \nEx-leader of Vulcans wants to sue NYC for slander \nEventually, Brooklyn federal Judge Nicholas Garaufis offered the city and the FDNY three ways to accept the results of 6019 without repeating its pattern of disparate hiring — but all three were rejected by the agencies. \nThe entire test was tossed out and its results invalidated — crushing the hopes of Adams and thousands of others. \nAdams said he entered a “spiral of hopelessness” when he got the news. But he dusted himself off and went back to Iraq for a second deployment. \n“Later I found out that a lawyer was able to get some of the 6019 guys who were deployed at the time onto the job — if I had just deployed a few months earlier, I might have made it, too,” he said. \nBy the time he came back, the FDNY had partially settled the Vulcans’ lawsuit and resumed hiring. \nAdams sat for the next test in 2011 — but this time, he only got a 98. It was far above the minimum pass of a 70 — but nowhere near high enough to guarantee he’d get hired amoung the roughly 40,000 people competing for about 3,000 spots. \n“My rank on the list is 6,488,” Adams said. “I scored well, but a 98 is like failing in the FDNY.” \nTo make matters worse, 1,700 other people got his exact same score, he said. \nThe FDNY breaks such ties with the last digit of the applicants’ Social Security numbers.

Once a new test has been given, the city will toss out the hiring list that Adams is on. He’s also too old to take the test again. \nThe FDNY, currently running a multi-million dollar ad campaign to encourage a diverse pool of applicants for the upcoming test, said there’s nothing it can do to help Adams. \n“Unfortunately, the department’s hands are tied. The test he originally took was thrown out as part of a court case and our hiring practices must follow state civil service law and court decisions,” said spokesman Frank Dwyer. \nAdams, who for the past 11 years has been a court officer in Brooklyn Supreme Court, said he’s mostly made his peace with his fate. \n“I have a beautiful 6-year-old daughter, a good job... but I felt that being a firefighter was my calling,” he said. “Every once in a while a fire truck goes by and it hurts. But, you gotta move on.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T06:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:51:13.485+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
