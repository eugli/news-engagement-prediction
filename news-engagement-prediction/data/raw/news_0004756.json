Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. JUST WATCHED Burned toddler's future waits on Trump's ban 03:36 Story highlights Two-year-old Dilbireen came to the US with a charity group for medical treatment The boy's parents, still in Iraq, want to be by his side, but the travel ban has them worried The parents have named their second child Trump to show appreciation for the US's care for their son (CNN) Severe burns disfigured the toddler's face. Scars are scattered under little Dilbireen Muhsin's chin. In Kurdish, the young Yazidi boy's name means \"wounded heart .\" Yet 2-year-old Dilbireen, affectionately called Dili, remains cheerful and self-sufficient. He enjoys cuddling with his blanket and playing peek-a-boo, and he exhibits more independence than many other children his age -- from feeding himself to brushing his own teeth . This might be because he has been without his mother for so long, said Dilbireen's caretaker, Adlay Kejjan, in an exclusive interview with CNN's chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Dilbireen arrived in the United States last year to receive medical treatment for severe burns after a fire in his home in a refugee camp. While he now lives with a family in Lansing, Michigan,his parents and baby brother are in their native country, Iraq. They're making efforts to be by Dilbireen's side in the United States, but their travel visas were revoked in early January. President Donald Trump's travel ban now has them concerned that they won't be able to get back to Dilbireenand that he might return to Iraq without additional surgeries to improve the function of his face. JUST WATCHED Trump on travel ban: Call it what you want 01:22 Read More Outside of a video-chat screen, Dilbireen hasn't seen his family in about four months, and he misses them, said Kejjan, director of the Yazidi American Women Organization. \"He feels abandoned by them. Because when they call, I can see, like, he doesn't want to interact with them, but sometimes when they're talking to me, he just looks at them like over my shoulder,\"she said from her home in Michigan this week. \"It's heart-breaking for all of us when we watch that. He definitely recognizes his dad, and I'm not sure about his mom. He's very confused, because he thinks I'm his mom.\" 'It's almost like he is the face of the Yazidis' Terror struck Dilbireen's family while he was still in his mother's womb. In 2014, when Dilbireen's mother, Flosa Khalaf, was pregnant with him, ISIS attacked their village . They're Yazidis, part of a small community living around Mount Sinjar in Iraq. The United States declared last year that ISIS committed genocide against the Yazidis. Dilbireen's family fled their home to escape the bloodshed. The young family found shelter among other displaced Yazidis in a refugee camp, where Dilbireen was born on January 4, 2015. A year later, around Dilbireen's first birthday, a fire sparked by a malfunctioning gas heater set his crib ablaze. Flosa was baking bread outside when her baby's crib went up in flames, and people nearby rushed to his aid. Dilbireen was severely burned on his face and feet, but a blanket protected the rest of his body from harm. JUST WATCHED MUST WATCH They survived ISIS, but may not survive the winter 02:47 Iraqi doctors advised the parents to get him treated outside the country, Dilbireen's father, Ajeel Muhsin, said. The UK-based charity Road to Peace made arrangements for Dilbireen to receive urgent medical care in Boston, where Shriners Hospitals for Children agreed to treat him and other injured refugee children at no cost. Road to Peace works with organizations around the world to help build alliances between communities in conflict and facilitate specialized medical care for refugee children. The family had a plan: With the charity's assistance, Dilbireen and Ajeel would go to the US for the boy's first round of reconstructive surgeries in October. Flosa, who was pregnant, would remain in Iraq. As Dilbireen recovered in the United States, Ajeel returned to Iraq for the baby's birth and then planned to accompany Flosa and their newborn to the United States so the family could reunite for the rest of Dilbireen's surgeries. After his treatment, the family would return to Iraq together. Dr. Shirzad Khaleel, medical coordinator for Road to Peace, and Sally Becker, who founded the charity, accompanied Dilbireen and Ajeel on their journey to the United States. \"This little boy, with everything he has been through, it's almost like he is the face of the Yazidis,\" Becker said. \"He is a symbol of their suffering. A symbol of everything they have been going through.\" Dilbireen's first treatments went well. But the family's travel plans didn't unfold so smoothly. A turn of events As planned, Ajeel traveled back to Iraq, and Dilbireen, who was still recovering, moved to Michigan to stay with Kejjan until his next round of surgeries. Flosa gave birth to their second child on November 9. When it came time to name their new son, the family thought of the country caring for their first baby boy. \"America is helping us to do surgery on our boy,\" Ajeel said in an interview from Iraq. His comments were translated from Kurdish. \"We want to show our appreciation to America for what they are doing for our boy.\" They named the newborn Trump. Ajeel and Flosa planned to join Dilbireen for his next surgery. Though they already had visas to travel to the United States, they submitted an application last month, before Trump took office, for a passport and visa for their newborn. Their application was denied , and then the visas they already had were revoked.

We want to finish our son's treatment and return back home. If that was our intention, we all would have gone there originally, when we had visas.\" Ajeel now has regrets about their travel plans and how long they've been apart. \"I wish we had all gone there together and the baby was born there,\" he said. \"But my plan was to return back.\" Dilbireen has yet to meet his baby brother. A desperate child in limbo Trump signed an executive order last week to keep refugees from entering the country for 120 days. Immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim nations -- Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia -- are unable to enter the country for at least the next 90 days. Dilbireen and his family, who count as refugees, might be among those impacted.
