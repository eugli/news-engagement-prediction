Ashiesh started his career in New York , but came back to India since he felt that the industry had saturated back in the States. From designing Ranbir Kapoor to Jacqueline Fernandez 's home, he has instantly become a hit among Bollywood actors. A compulsive art collector, he believes in the aesthetics of a beauty that is imperfect and incomplete. We caught up with the design maestro to know more about the his world of wizardry. Your approach towards design has made you a hit. What is the 'approach' all about? My practice has evolved over the years and with it, my philosophy on aesthetics. What has remained constant however, is my belief in aesthetic philosophy of Wabi Sabi , which implies the aesthetics of a beauty that is imperfect and incomplete. The Japanese concept is derived from Buddhist teachings. Thus, asymmetry and asperity play a major role in my practice. I appreciate spaces that incorporate natural objects and processes and I try to maintain this principle in my own practice. Nothing is permanent, nothing is finished and nothing is perfect. Tell us about your most challenging project till now and what made it challenging? It's really hard to choose one defining project, but if I had to, it would be my home. It is an expression of what I do and who I am. I feel like it was mine from start to finish. I have worked on some very exciting projects, with clients who were keen to experiment, but when you're designing your own home, you experience an artistic freedom. But as a designer, I found it quite challenging to design something for myself. I wanted to create a space that would evolve with me and my practice. I wanted to create a space that was versatile and a constant work in progress. (Image: Ashiesh Shah's 'Daga residence' Mumbai penthouse) What factors did you determine while doing up Hrithik Roshan's house? Today's celebrity home owners have a discerning eye for all things chic and sophisticated. As per my experience of working with several young celebrities including Ranbir Kapoor, Hrithik Roshan, Katrina Kaif and Jaqueline Fernandez, I've noticed that most young actors today have a traveller's eye and their homes often reflect a cultivated sense of art, design and the latest trends. I think one of the key elements to remember when working on a celebrity home is keeping in mind features like privacy, security and entertainment spaces as well as comfortable areas for the family to be together and enjoy relaxation. Which is that one thing that remains constant in your designs, always? Incorporating art! Art is inextricable from its surroundings and therefore intrinsically linked to architecture. In many ways, they are the two sides of the same coin. You started your career in New York. What made you come back to Mumbai? I was in New York for several years and wanted a change. The New York design industry felt quite saturated, I felt like there was so much more to do back home in Mumbai. Collecting art is another obsession you have. Tell us about your collection. I initially collected Indian moderns. Having grown up in Mumbai, I easily related to artists like FN Souza and the Progressives. But gradually, I began collecting contemporary art, in terms of its concerns, I felt like they were relevant and ultimately reflected those of my generation. My collection is an eclectic one, it includes works by established international artists; a drawing by Tracey Emin, Ai Weiwei's crystal hanger and photo documentation of Marina Abramovich's early performances. It also includes influential Indian artists like Subodh Gupta, Sudarshan Shetty and Bharti Kher, young contemporary artists like Sahej Rahal and Ayesha Sultana.
