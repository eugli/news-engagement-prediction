The friends of Romero paid $1,050 to clear the warrants about 3 a.m. Romero, originally from Mexico, was released Wednesday afternoon from the Richardson jail. But Romero was held overnight under a detainer issued by Immigration and Custom Enforcement, or ICE. \n“He is the best of our country,” said Michelle Pareja, an attorney with the Dallas legal nonprofit that represents Romero, the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services. \nPareja said the Romero case illustrates why collaboration with ICE should end. \nRomero, a student at the University of Texas at Dallas, said at a hastily called news conference that he was \"super-happy\" to be free. \"I couldn't believe it when they pretty much told me, 'You are free to go,'\" he said Wednesday evening. \nRomero is in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program. DACA provides two-year work permits and a reprieve from potential deportations for certain people brought illegally to the U.S. by their parents. \nDuring the presidential campaign, Trump slammed DACA as an “executive amnesty.” More recently, his attitude softened on DACA even as his administration has maintained a hard line on deporting other immigrants. This week, in a memo with implementing instructions for Trump’s tough interior executive order on immigration, those with DACA were provided an exception. There are about 752,000 immigrants nationally with DACA protections. \n“DACA is a very, very difficult subject for me, I will tell you,” Trump said. “To me, it's one of the most difficult subjects I have because you have these incredible kids.” \n“It's a very difficult thing for me because you know, I love these kids, I love kids, I have kids and grandkids. And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do and you know, the law is rough.” Edwin Romero, a Mexican immigrant with DACA, gets a hug from his friend Roy Ferretiz at a news conference. (Tom Fox/The Dallas Morning News) \nAn ICE official in Dallas didn’t respond to emails and phone calls on the Romero case. \nUnder the older Obama-era policy, traffic warrants would not typically be enough to prompt the immediate detention and subsequent deportation proceedings for an unauthorized immigrant, said a law enforcement official. In new rules under Trump which widen the power of ICE to detain and more quickly deport unauthorized immigrants. \nRomero was 6 years old when he was brought to the U.S. from Morelia in the central Mexican state of Michoacan by his single mother. He is currently studying accounting at UTD. \nRomero has been a key organizer in the North Texas Dream Team. The local Dream Team is part of a larger national coalition of young immigrants fighting for legalization of most of the unauthorized population in the United States. Some Dreamers now want Trump to explicitly renew the DACA program. \n\"He is very unassuming and very selfless,\" said his friend Kristian Hernandez. \"He never wants to showcase the great work he has done.\" \nRomero on Wednesday urged DACA beneficiaries to pay their outstanding tickets. He said he was saving money to do so, but also supports his mother. \nA social media campaign erupted on Wednesday for Romero after his friends learned he’d been detained. Hernandez wrote in a post: “I need your help. Last night, my dear friend Edwin Romero was arrested. He is a DACA beneficiary and yet they have placed an ICE hold on him... Please call Richardson City Jail... let them know this is UNACCEPTABLE.” \nDefiant hashtags followed: #HereToStay and #Not1More. \nFree again, Romero effusively thanked his friends and the community for mobilizing. \"There is an army of community people behind us,\" Romero said. \"Don't have fear. Be informed.\" \n**", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T09:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:35:58.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
