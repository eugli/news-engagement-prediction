Slot to Georgia Links \nKirby Smart seemed pretty excited at Georgia's indoor practice facility dedication on Tuesday and who could blame him? His program recently gained use of a $30.2 million practice facility, making it the final program in the SEC to gain that advantage. \nEarlier in the day $63 million was approved to build a brand new locker room and recruiting lounge in the west end zone of Sanford Stadium. Big things are happening at Georgia and Smart hopes it's always that way. \n\"I think most of the places I’ve been at stadiums have had a recruiting room or a place to host recruits,\" Smart said of the Sanford Stadium project. \"So we want to catch up to that. But we also want to go beyond that. We want to do a better job and have a nice place for our players – a game-day locker room.\" \n' (Photo: UGA Athletics: Jon Paul Van Wert) \nThe benefits of an indoor facility are well-documented at this point. The Bulldogs were losing valuable practice time when the weather was poor and had no way to hide from the brutal August heat. But the new facilities at the stadium will be useful for much more than just game days. \nAccording to Smart the Bulldogs like to use the facilities at Sanford Stadium to serve meals to recruits. For unofficial visits, those groups can be quite big. Now Smart will have a 500-person recruiting lounge at his disposal on the second level of the west end zone. Not a member?

A lot of teams in the (SEC) West, obviously, have had these venues.\" \n(What's next for the Bulldogs?
