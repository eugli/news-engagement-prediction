I just want to throw it away and focus on baseball right now. It gave me a little bit of stress. This case has been out there for a little bit. It was a tough process for me and my family. I hope this gets over real soon.\" Outlook: Martin, OF, SEA Outlook: Martin brings blend of speed, pop After setting career bests in homers and runs scored in 2016, Leoyns Martin will look to sustain his newfound pop to offset his modest OBP \nThe rest of life is far happier now for the 28-year-old, who solidified Seattle's outfield defense last year and hit .247 with a career-best 15 homers and also led the Mariners with 24 stolen bases after being acquired from the Rangers in a trade. \nMartin missed the first three days of full-squad workouts, but arrived in time to take his physical and be on the field for most of Wednesday's session. It didn't take long for his presence to be felt. \n\"He's a big part of what we do here,\"   said. \"The personality and life he brings to the clubhouse, he's already yelling and screaming at guys, and guys are screaming back at him. Everybody is back in their comfort zone.\" \nMartin says he lost 10 pounds this offseason and is looking to be part of Seattle's improved running game with the addition of Jarrod Dyson and Jean Segura . Martin spent some time in the Dominican hitting with Robinson Cano as well. \n\"I want to get better,\" he said. \"Last year was good. I hit 15 homers, but that's not part of my game. I want to stay focused on my part. I have to know what kind of player I am and stay in my game, get my on-base a little bit higher and try to steal 30-40 bases. \n\"I don't go to bat thinking about hitting three homers. I try to create situations for my team and the big boys behind me. That's what I am going to be focused on this year.\" \nWith Martin's arrival, the Mariners now have all 62 players in camp. has covered the Mariners since 1997, and for MLB.com since 2011.
