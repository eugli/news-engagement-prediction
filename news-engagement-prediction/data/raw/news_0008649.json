They argued the proposals protected the rights of sexual offenders at the expense of their victims \nMPs James Nyikal (Seme), Wanjiku Muhia (Nyandarua County) Florence Kajuju (Meru County), Tom Kajwang (Ruaraka) Joseph M'eruaki (Igembe North) and Ken Okoth (Kibra) termed the proposed amendments as backward. \nALSO READ: Rogue lawyers, greedy telcos in MPsâ€™ last agenda \n\"It is known very well that 18 years is the right age of maturity and thus lowering the age to 16 exposes children to abuse,\" said Muhia. \nHer Igembe North counterpart termed the amendments 'dangerous.'\"The Bill is very dangerous. It is common knowledge that children under 16 years are still under the care of their parents,\" said M'eruaki. \nMeru MP described the amendments illegal. \n\"We cannot as a nation agree to be parties to an illegality by allowing this amendment to go through,\" said Kajuju. \nA former Health PS, Dr Nyikal said reducing the age of consent to 16 goes against laws of child development, arguing that biological maturity does not mean social maturity. \n\"Biological and social maturity are not the same. These young adults cannot take responsibility,\" he said. \nLawyer Tom Kajwang accused the act's drafters of trying to sneak in mischievous and unconstitutional amendments. \nThe MPs proposed that the act be referred the Justice and Legal affairs committee. Duale bowed to pressure and promised to withdraw amendments.
