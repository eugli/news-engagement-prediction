Reed, a mayoral candidate, is a sponsor of legislation that would give city money for Scottrade Center upgrades. David Steward (left) and Lewis Reed Steward in 2016 donated another $65,000 to Reed’s committee, Missouri Ethics Commission records show. Tom Shepherd , Reed’s chief of staff, said Reed and Steward have never had a conversation about Scottrade Center. “We only learned of his minority interest from the media,” Shepherd said. “From what we understand, it is probably a very small item in regards to his overall holdings.” Shepherd also said Reed has sacrificed about $80,000 per year in foregone earnings from a previous career to be board president. The president’s salary is about $80,000, and each alderman is allowed a taxable $4,200 expense fund. Reed and Steward “developed a relationship some years ago and Mr. Steward’s support reflects his confidence that President Reed will make a good mayor for the city of St. Louis,” Shepherd said. Through a World Wide Technology spokesperson, Steward declined to comment. A Blues spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
