I always said when I turn 30, that will be the defining moment of what I want to do,” Lindsay said on Good Morning Britain. “I found a lot of solace. I reached inside and what my intentions were in the world. Taking control of my life,” she added. \nLindsay , who began her acting career at the age of 10, when she appeared on soap opera Another World , says she believes living in Los Angeles as a teenager contributed to her troubled past as she “surrounded” herself with “the wrong people.” \nLindsay Lohan reveals her ‘Muslim’ side \nWhen asked if she thinks the city was the problem, she said, “I think so. It moves so fast there, it’s easier to surround yourself with any person than it is to be alone.” \nLindsay continued, “I don’t think it was ever turning to anything. It (drink) was very accessible when I was 16, 17, 18, 19. I had been working so much and surrounded myself with the wrong people going out drinking was the wrong thing to do. I didn’t listen to anyone.” \nHave something to add to the story?
