According to one British aid worker, who had previously worked in the refugee camps in Afghanistan, conditions in Greece are worse.\nFrom the summer of 2015, Greece had become a gateway to Europe for thousands of Syrians fleeing the war in their homeland. Finally, after months of wrangling and confusion, and as countries around Greece closed their borders to refugees, the EU signed a deal with Turkey on 20 March 2016 which shut the doors of Europe and decreed that refugees arriving in Greece would now be sent back to Turkey if their asylum claims were rejected.\nThe result has been confusion. Overcrowding is the biggest single issue for many camps. Moria reception centre on the Greek island of Lesbos has a capacity of 1,500 people, for example. But recent estimates suggest it is housing more than 4,000 people because of huge bottlenecks in the asylum process. Samos centre has a capacity of 700-800 people. In December it was housing 1,400, according to one Samos-based aid worker.\n\nA man sits by a fire in a refugee camp on Samos island, Greece Photograph: Photo by refugee \nMany refugees in these camps and others continue to endure below freezing temperatures in thin summer tents, despite the fact that nearly €90m has been disbursed by the EU to help during the winter months. \n“[Six months ago] people were saying it was a waste of money to change all these tents to containers because the refugees wouldn’t be staying here for long [before being returned to Turkey or relocated to another country] but now they really need them,” said Edith Chazelle, a former camp management coordinator for the Norwegian Refugee Council, describing how the tents flood when it rains and offer little privacy or security. \nThe camps also often lack basic amenities and are in unsuitable sites. Natasha Sim from the International Rescue Committee said the camps are more overcrowded than ones she’s worked in in other countries but are also situated in worse places – former army bases and disused warehouses. “We have come across water sources contaminated with high rates of nitrate in some warehouse sites” she said.\nSteve Moore is a British builder who volunteered in a camp on the island of Thessaloniki and was shocked by the conditions. “A woman asked if I could stop the excess waste water from the portable toilets running into her tent. I couldn’t believe nothing had been done about it as soon as it was seen – this was raw sewage running into a tent in which a family was expected to live. Then I was asked to fill up all the holes in the women’s bathroom because it was possible for snakes to get in – they killed a snake nearly every other day I was there.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Migrants block the entrance of the Hellinikon camp in Athens during a protest over poor living conditions.

A fire left an eight-year-old boy in a life-threatening condition in Oreokastro camp in October. The boy’s mother had left a hotplate on in an attempt to heat her tent and keep the family warm, according to the International Organisation of Migration. A fire also killed an adult and a child in Moria camp in November. Police found that a gas canister, used for cooking or heating inside the tent, started the fire.\nFlorian Horsch, from volunteer group Soup and Socks, is not surprised by these incidents. He said current camp conditions are accidents waiting to happen. “In October at Kastikas, we had strong winds that caused concrete pillars to collapse on to tents, smashing a buggy with a young baby in it. The baby boy was catapulted out of his carriage.”\nTensions are high among refugees over the conditions. “We’ve had some really shocking incidents, all the administrative containers being burnt down in Helios, some really violent protests, and a guy set himself alight in a hotspot in Samos in protest at the conditions,” said one Samos-based NGO worker. There are growing anxieties about safety, as Moore discovered, after locks that he had installed on the toilets were taken by refugee women who were too scared to sleep without a lock on their door.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Syrian refugee Elan Darwish, 14 months, sleeps inside his family’s tent in Kalochori refugee camp on the outskirts of Thessaloniki. Photograph: Muhammed Muheisen/AP \nFor Pru Waldorf, a long-term volunteer with Calais Action in Samos, it’s the things she can’t see that worry her most, describing how there is no NGO presence in her camp after 8pm. “No one’s really keeping track of the children and women going missing and people smuggling.”\nFunding is available \nThe situation has been worsened by the impact of the EU-Turkey deal, an agreement signed in March 2016 that stated for every Syrian refugee on the Greek islands who is returned to Turkey, a Syrian asylum seeker in Turkey will be resettled in Europe. \n\nThe Greek authorities have struggled to implement the deal on the ground though, meaning many migrants who arrived on the islands after 19 March have ended up being detained for months, rather than days. Thus, camps which had initially been designed for short-term use and set up haphazardly in often remote locations without electricity, sewage and water access, suddenly had long-term residents.\n“Overnight 38 or so random sites popped up and we’ve now got to retrospectively improve the quality of those sites, so it’s been more difficult than in other places,” said the British aid worker who had previously worked in Afghanistan.\nThe funding would appear to be more than adequate. Greece has received $334,893,372 (£268bn) through the UN’s 2016 Inter-Agency Appeal. For the 62,711 people currently considered persons of concern, that breaks down to $5,340 (£4,273) per head per year; meanwhile Lebanon, housing roughly 954,000 more refugees, has received $1,051,948,838 (just $1,034, or £827, per person).\nEgypt is catering for almost twice as many refugees as Greece with 10 times less funding per head. Costs in Europe are higher, but a growing number of aid workers believe that the greater costs of operating in Greece also stem from the Greek government’s indecisiveness, and through the long chain of organisations through which the funding must pass before it reaches the camps. \n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A refugee stands next to a pool of mud at Moria refugee camp in Lesbos.

Greek politicians themselves admit there is a lack of political will to bring change. “We want to help but it’s like turning a gun to your head because if you improve the situation, more refugees will come,” a local government worker in Samos told the Guardian.\nIn theory, refugees who arrived after the EU-Turkey deal are supposed to be detained no more than 25 days before either being sent back to Turkey or being relocated elsewhere. The reality is refugees are now spending on average eight months to a year in camps.\nMaria Stavropoulou, director of the Greek asylum service, acknowledged that the application processing time is too long, but said with 41,000 applications and another 15,000 pending, “six times our 2015 workload”, her agency is simply overwhelmed.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Riot police stand guard as tents burn during a large fire inside the Moria refugee camp last September. Photograph: Michael Schwarz/AP \nFurthermore, the EU is simply not offering enough support to the Greek government. “The rest of the EU wants to outsource its moral responsibility,” said one aid worker, describing how the EU relocation scheme for Syrian refugees could have really helped Greece but EU countries have so far only relocated 5% of the total number they promised to take from overstretched Greece and Italy by September 2017. \n\nWith Germany recently announcing plans to send refugees back to Greece, there will only be more pressure on these camps and the asylum office. Refugees, aid workers, politicians and the public are now being forced to readjust their expectations of wealthy nations’ abilities to protect and provide for the world’s most vulnerable people.\n“This is Greece where British tourists go on holiday, people expected a better response than they would see in a developing country” explains Rowbotham. “Imagine if it was the UK, would you be comfortable with 50,000 refugees living in tents?,” she said. “It would be a national shame. We are from countries where you don’t put refugees in tents, that’s the bottom line.”\nJoin our community of development professionals and humanitarians.
