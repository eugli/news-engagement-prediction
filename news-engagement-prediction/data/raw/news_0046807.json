Chicago-based Girls Supporting Girls is a small but powerful organization that teaches girls (and boys, despite the name) how to raise money to build schools in countries where girls are often left out of education. (webphotographeer / E+) Heidi Stevens a documentary about nine girls living in Haiti, Nepal, Ethiopia, India, Egypt, Peru, Cambodia, Sierra Leone and Afghanistan and fighting mightily for their right to go to school.\nThen she heard a radio interview with John Wood, the founder of Room to Read , an international nonprofit that works to increase literacy and gender equality in education around the world. \n\"I knew I wanted to do something to get my own kids more involved and aware,\" Taylor said. \"And I also wanted to help on a more global level.\" \nRELATED: TRENDING LIFE & STYLE NEWS THIS HOUR \nShe huddled with a couple of friends and established Girls Supporting Girls , a small nonprofit that offers after-school programs to teach kids about the barriers that girls, particularly, face when trying to receive an education in many developing countries. The group is in just three schools so far, but Taylor is hoping to expand across the city if she can attract more volunteers and funding. \nStudents learn about the state of education in developing countries and brainstorm ways to make it more accessible. They host bake sales and lemonade stands and sell T-shirts and buttons at school events to raise money for schools in Asia and Africa. \n\"They're learning that it's not so easy for a lot of kids to just walk down the block to a school that's willing and able to accept them,\" Taylor said. \nEven better, they're learning to do something about it. \nGirls Supporting Girls partners with Room to Read, which has an established infrastructure to build schools and libraries around the world. Taylor said her group helped raise $35,000 to build a school in northwest Cambodia in 2015, which serves around 155 middle schoolers. And now it's trying to raise $55,000 to build a school in Sri Lanka. \nDespite the name, Girls Supporting Girls programs are all coed. \nTaylor has twin eighth-graders — a boy and a girl — and knows firsthand that the work of improving the world isn't limited to a single gender. But girls are disproportionately left out of school in far too many countries, which is one of the things Taylor's group tries to remedy. \n\"Our primary goal is to help girls because there are roughly 33 million fewer girls than boys in primary schools around the world,\" Taylor said. (United Nations statistics concur.) \"And educating girls betters the chances that entire families are lifted out of poverty.\" \nI admire so much about Taylor's story. How many of us have thought — watching a documentary, riding in our cars, reading an article — I should do something about this ? But life intervenes. Or the problems feel too large. Or progress seems too elusive. \nGirls Supporting Girls remind kids — and all of us — the wisdom of that lovely Margaret Mead quote: \n\"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.\" \nTwitter @heidistevens13 \nGirls Supporting Girls will hold its annual fundraiser 6 -9 p.m. Thursday night at City Winery, 1200 W. Randolph St . It's open to the public, and the money raised will go toward funding the Sri Lanka school, Taylor said.
