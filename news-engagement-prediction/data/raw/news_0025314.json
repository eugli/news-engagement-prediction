It's the second such incident in three days, after a massive Tembusu tree toppled at the Singapore Botanic Gardens on Saturday, killing one person and injuring four others. \nMonday's incident happened at the carpark of Block 134D Yuan Ching Road, outside a block of student apartments. The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said that it received a call for assistance at about 2.30pm. \nThe injured woman, Janet Cher, was in a lorry with her brother and a friend's daughter when the tree fell on the vehicle. Her brother, Adam Cher, said his sister was hit on the head but the lorry's door helped to shield her from further impact. \n\"But I think that her skull might be fractured,\" Mr Cher said in Mandarin. He and the girl were not injured. Ms Cher was taken to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital. \nThe area where the tree fell is managed by the Singapore Land Authority (SLA). \nIn a statement on Monday, an SLA spokesperson said the incident is under investigation. \"Trees and greenery in state properties are maintained on a regular basis. Our priority now is to provide assistance to the family of the affected party whom we are in touch with,\" SLA added. - CNA/gs", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T19:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T15:24:45.449+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
