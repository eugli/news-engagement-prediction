Eight-month-old Gabriel was in a baby sled and got completely soaked.\nNeedless to say, Pelletier wasn't impressed.\n\"Initially, I was quite upset,\" he said. \"I was kind of hoping [my wife] had gotten some identifying information for the vehicle that we could pass along to police, but obviously the first concern was making sure my son was fine.\"\nHe had salty, dirty water in his face and eyes because someone couldn't be troubled to obey the law @ctvregina @SGItweets @reginapolice pic.twitter.com/C9i43RBV6q\n— @_Reynard_ In Saskatoon and Regina, it's illegal for drivers to splash pedestrians.\nSplashed in Saskatchewan? Police might be able to help Regina police will pursue complaints against drivers, but those splashed need to note the time, date and location, and write down the vehicle's licence plate number.\nIn Saskatoon, the penalty for splashing a pedestrian can be $90. In Regina, it can be as high as $200.\nOn social media, police weren't very happy about the incident either.\nDrivers, please do NOT splash pedestrians of ANY age. We should not need to teach common courtesy. #yqrtraffic #yqr https://t.co/uVsxiw59PN\n— @reginapolice Pelletier still isn't entirely sure whether the driver intentionally splashed his son. At the end of the day, he just wants drivers to be more observant.\n\"I would just say please be careful of what you're doing and where you're driving,\" he said. \"This is a relatively harmless incident, but anything could have happened.\"\nNow, baby Gabriel is doing alright.\nHe's doing much better.
