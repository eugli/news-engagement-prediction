We played peekaboo with him through the window to calm him down. \n“He eventually stopped crying. We used some tools to pry open the door a little, and then slid in a wire through the gap. \n“We hooked the wire onto the keys and fished them out. The process took about 20 minutes,” Noor Fazida said. \nShe said the child was still shaken when he was taken out of the car. \n“I took his pulse after we had rescued him. \n“His heart was beating fast because he had been crying for a long time. \n“But the little boy was okay otherwise. \n“I advised his mother to take him to a clinic if he developed a fever,” she added. \nNoor Fazida said the firefighters had been involved in 10 or 11 similar cases over the past two years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:21:11.556+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
