Making movies is great but if you ask me at 3am what I really want to do, it’s put on my whites and play cricket. I don’t want to waste any more of my cricketing years.’ Sree is a cricketer turned heartthrob film star, married to royalty and with a millionaire lifestyle But he has said that what he misses at 3am is donning his cricket whites, and he doesn't want to waste any more time Just three years ago, the former fast bowler was still at the top of his game but was given a lifetime ban for his alleged role in a match-fixing scandal in the 2013 Indian Premier League. The charges were later dropped and he was exonerated by a Delhi court but the ban imposed still remains and there is no formal appeals process, meaning he is unable to play cricket anywhere. Now Glenrothes Cricket Club want to give the 34-year-old the chance to resurrect his cricketing career by offering him a place on their team for a season. He has never been to Fife before but the club, which plays in Scotland’s Eastern Premier league, hope that if he can persuade the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) within the next couple of weeks to reconsider their ban, he will be playing for them by the summer. He added: ‘I haven’t played for three years and if I can get the ban lifted, I will be on the next flight to Scotland. I would love to play for the club and work with the youngsters to share some of my skills.’ Cricket Scotland will not allow him to be registered as a Glenrothes player until the BCCI issue a ‘No Objection Certificate’, which permits him to play competitive cricket without breaching International Cricket Council (ICC) regulations. If the Indian authorities refuse, the Fife club intends to take the fight to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland. He is widely considered to be one of the top three bowlers in the world Yesterday, Glenrothes Cricket Club president Eddie Gibbs, who is in almost daily contact with the player he befriended after meeting him for the first time at a sporting event in London a few years ago, said the team were keen to right what they saw as an injustice towards a ‘hero of the game’. He said: ‘He is genuinely innocent and this is a miscarriage of justice. ‘The BCCI are the only ones who can make this all go away as there is no system for appeal or natural justice. But they refuse to talk to the player or his representatives.’ Sreesanth, whose wife Bhuvneshwari Kumari is a member of the Diwanpura royal family from Rajasthan, said: ‘I’m not asking for the BCCI to let me back into the Indian team but if they would just lift the ban I could start again at club level. Eddie has become like family to me. He’s given me a great opportunity at Glenrothes.’ The cricketer, who is widely considered to be one of the top three best bowlers in the world, is hoping a current reshuffle of management at the BCCI could lead to a positive outcome for him, now that the officials who imposed the ban have departed. Sreesanth was arrested in June 2013 by Delhi Police and remanded in custody along with two other players, Ankeet Chavan and Ajit Chandila, and 16 other people - including 14 alleged bookies – as part of a huge anti-corruption investigation. It’s not clear whether his young family would join him in Fife for his stint at the club. The couple have a 20-month-old daughter and a three-month-old baby son, Currently the cricketer splits his time between his hometown in the southern Indian state of Kerala and Mumbai, where his Bollywood film career is based. He has appeared in the Indian TV version of Dancing with the Stars and made his film debut in the 2015 hit Big Picture. He keeps fit nowadays by using a private cricket ground he paid to have built himself, so he can practice his bowling skills without breaching guidelines. ‘It’s my ground, so no one can stop me,’ he says defiantly. ‘I’ve been very badly treated for a two-time World Cup winner. I will never give up trying to get back to play cricket.’ The player, who was part of India’s 2007 and 2011 World Cup winning teams and, added: ‘I’m looking fit and bowling much better than the way I used to play. With age comes maturity, now I’m able to control my aggression on the field better and focus on my performance. I’m ready for Scotland.’ He could be making his big return to the sport at a small club in Scotland, pictured above A BCCI spokesman said: ‘Mr Sreesanth faces a life ban by BCCI and this has been communicated to the ICC also.’ The Scottish season starts in April and the Glenrothes club are keeping a space open for him indefinitely. The player is so keen to play for the team that he has offered his services on a voluntary basis and waived the £5000 to £8000 fee he would normally expect for his time assisting at the club. Mr Gibbs admitted the idea of an international star playing at their club had caused quite a stir. Laughing, he said: ‘When I first mentioned it at the club, the reaction was shock. We are just a small club and people had to pinch themselves. If this comes off, and we’re confident it will, there won’t have been a story like this in Scottish cricket ever before.’ Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T08:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T04:36:26.795+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
