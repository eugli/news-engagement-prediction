February 21, 2017 10:09 PM by Ariel Feldman Katherine Holmgren and Erik Serrano Berntsen’s Wedding Photo: Richard Stow With weddings becoming days-long social media events and guest lists growing longer and longer, etiquette begs the question: When hosting a rehearsal dinner, do you have to invite everyone who is on the list for the main event? ”The rehearsal dinner was once a formal affair hosted by the groom’s parents and limited to the bridal party and the bride’s parents,” says celebrity wedding planner Mindy Weiss . “Nowadays, the guest list typically includes out-of-town guests, extended family, and close friends. As the celebration has grown larger, the rehearsal dinner has become a creative event that is either a lovely dinner or a fun casual celebration. Think of the rehearsal dinner as the kickoff to the wedding festivities, the event that introduces two families and friends to each other,” Weiss says. Conventional wisdom says if you’re having a local wedding, it’s not necessary to play host to hundreds at the rehearsal dinner, but if you’re planning a destination wedding most sources recommend inviting the whole gang. However, Connecticut based wedding planner Sarah True of True Event suggests this convention doesn't always have to be the case. “Keeping the rehearsal dinner to just bridal party and family allows for it to be a really special time, preventing the evening from turning into a duplicate wedding. A good way to get around inviting everyone to the rehearsal dinner is to host a small rehearsal dinner and then invite all guests that are in town the night before the wedding to a welcome reception after dinner,” True says. True suggests starting the rehearsal dinner around 6 p.m., leaving enough time for an 8:30 – 11 p.m. welcome reception with passed hors d'oeuvres, desserts, and cocktails. For weddings with a large out-of-town list, Jennifer Stiebel of Soco Events also suggests a welcome cocktail party after the rehearsal dinner for all guests to attend as a perfect alternative. “Host at a location that suits the couple’s history, a favorite place, or a point of interest in the city of the wedding. This is a great opportunity to welcome those who have traveled to celebrate and kick off the weekend,” Stiebel says. International wedding planner Colin Cowie says that bucking tradition on the locale can sometimes be more fun. “Typically, the rehearsal dinner is more casual in nature compared to the wedding—at a venue like the parents’s home, a country club, or local restaurant,” Cowie explains. But if the list is getting crazy and you’d prefer not to host the entire crew two nights in a row, Cowie suggests having an intimate rehearsal dinner with family, then heading over to a “small, fun bar to meet the entire group after dinner. This way, the long speeches are only meant for those closest to you,” he suggests. Whatever you decide, remember not to stay out too late at your own rehearsal dinner—you’ve got a big day ahead of you!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:52:06.232+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
