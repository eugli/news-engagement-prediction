We are honored to pay tribute to the 25th anniversary of ‘Homer at the Bat,’ ” Jeff Idelson, president of the National Baseball Hall of Fame, said in a press release.\n“ ‘The Simpsons’ has left an impressive imprint on our culture as the longest-running American sitcom, and ‘Homer at the Bat’ remains as popular today as when the episode aired in 1992. Baseball is recognized as our National Pastime due to its wide intersection with American culture over the last two centuries, evident in literature, theater, language, art, music, film and television. ‘The Simpsons’ is a perfect example of that connection to Americana.”\nThe event will include a roundtable discussion with Boggs, Smith, executive producers Al Jean and Mike Reiss, director Jim Reardon, executive story editor Jeff Martin and casting director Bonnie Pietila. (AP) The event will include a roundtable discussion with Boggs, Smith, executive producers Al Jean and Mike Reiss, director Jim Reardon, executive story editor Jeff Martin and casting director Bonnie Pietila.\n“When I struck out in tee-ball, I never dreamed I'd make it to the Hall of Fame,” Jean said. “It shows what not following your dreams can do.”\nThe roundtable discussion will run from 9:30 a.m. to 11 a.m. on May 27 outside the Library entrance to the Hall of Fame in Cooper Park, followed by a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the “Simpsons”-themed display exhibit in the museum.\nThe Home Run Derby begins at noon at Doubleday Field, followed by the Hall of Fame classic game with six Hall of Famers and recently retired players.\nSend a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:07:22.200+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
