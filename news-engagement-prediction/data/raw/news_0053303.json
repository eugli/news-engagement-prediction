More importantly, he wants to see the contamination be prevented in the first place, by way of proper maintenance and upgrades to municipal water treatment facilities. \n“The priorities need to be slightly changed in order to make sure these problems are stopped and they don’t recur in the future,” said Holley. “Because it will recur if we don’t make the proper investment in the systems to prevent discharge of sewage into water systems.” \nSamadhin agreed these situations can provide learning opportunities. \n“Any sort of foodborne outbreak, any sort of safety challenge or issue that we deal with I think is a good vehicle for prompting change,” said Samadhin. Consumer caution \nConsumers should always take caution when it comes to consuming any raw shellfish, Holley said, as risks certainly exist. But you don’t necessarily need to ban it from your diet. \n“I certainly don’t want to make people paranoid.” \n“When you take a look at the number of folks that consume raw oysters in North America and the number of cases [of illness] that occur in proportion is not all that large,” said Holley. \nBoth experts said cooking oysters will greatly reduce the risk of illness, along with proper food handling. \nHolley said those with underlying medical conditions should think twice before consuming raw shellfish. \n“For other healthy individuals, you are increasing your risk of getting ill somewhat, but I think that for someone who really likes raw oysters it shouldn’t really stop you from eating them.” \nHolley said people are taking just as much of a risk when eating pre-cut bagged salads. \nFood contaminated with noroviruses often look, smell and taste normal. Norovirus rarely results in death, Holley said, but it is very “uncomfortable” and spreads rapidly. \nTypical symptoms include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and stomach cramps; symptoms can also include low-grade fever, chills, muscle aches, headache and fatigue. Illness usually last for one to three days. \nYou are contagious while sick, and for as long as a few days to two weeks after recovery. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:32:25.752+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
