More by Suzette Parmley Arrow icon \nAlbert Boscov, 87, chairman of the family-owned department store chain founded by his father, died Friday in Reading of pancreatic cancer. \nMr. Boscov had revealed in a Feb. 1 letter to his 7,500 employees in 45 stores in seven states that he had end-stage cancer. \nThe company announced his death Friday night in a statement that described Mr. Boscov as a dynamic retailer and philanthropist who believed in hard work, honesty, and treating his employees like family, and his customers fairly and with respect. \n\"Albert Boscov was truly one of the giants in the retail industry, \" said his nephew Jim Boscov, 67, the company's chief executive officer and vice chairman. \"He was a man of vision and passion and he had a profound influence on the retail business community and the community at large. We are committed to continue on the strong foundation he has created and to carry on in the spirit and philosophy he’s instilled. Building on his legacy we will remain the largest family-owned department store in the country.\" \nBoscov said he made a promise to his beloved Uncle Albert as recently as a week ago. \n\"I promised him that I would maintain our commitment to not only excellence and taking care of our customers, but also caring for our co-workers and maintaining strong relationships with our vendors so our customers ultimately benefit,\" Boscov said in an interview late Friday night. \n\n\n\nMr. Boscov took over the company from his father, Solomon, in 1950. After Mr. Boscov retired, the company took a fall and filed for bankruptcy in 2008. But in an extraordinary turnaround, Mr. Boscov rescued the company the following year by buying it lifting it out of bankruptcy. \nBoscov's is now the largest family-owned department store chain in the country with sales of more than $1 billion from locations spanning from Ohio to Connecticut to Maryland. \nMr. Boscov was the youngest of four children born to a Russian immigrant. \nIn a 2009 interview with the Inquirer, he told about he learned a valuable life lesson while performing one of his first jobs for his father: killing flies. \nHe had to kill 30 flies to earn a dime. It took a lot of effort, but then he came up with a shortcut. \n\"I realized that dead flies looked the same the next week,\" he said. \nMr. Boscov's father didn't fall for the ruse. \n\"He gave me a lecture on integrity,\" he said. \"That week, I didn't get a dime.\" \nIn 1914, his father opened the first store in Reading. The firm later expanded into the Philadelphia suburbs. \nAfter the chain re-emerged from bankruptcy, Mr. Boscov again expanded its reach. \n\nJim Boscov, who became CEO two years ago, said he worked with and for Mr. Boscov for nearly 30 years. The last two years they worked side by side \"preparing for a smooth transition,\" he said. \n\n\"He had such an energy and spirit that he brought to the job everyday,\" Jim Boscov said. \"It's so sad to lose such a dynamic person. I learned so much from him — from what it takes to run a successful business to being a really good person who truly cared about his employees and customers. That's what our company is built on. \n\"That's becoming a rarity in our industry,\" he added. \nIndeed, in an era where brick and mortar department stores are closing by droves and laying off thousands of workers due to online competition, Boscov's stood out as unique. For the last several years it had been average one new store every year. \nBoscov's stores target middle America with deep discounts on brand items and value is king . Each has a retro feel like they're from a bygone era — such as having a fudge counter and furniture section still. \n\"To the very end he showed his respect and love for his employees,\" Jim Boscov said. \nThe family will hold a private funeral, and a memorial service for Boscov's employees and everyone else at a later date. \nOn Friday, Mr. Boscov posted a note on the company's Facebook page to thank people for their support and good wishes. It read: \nMy friends on Facebook, \nI've been amazed at the amount of wonderful notes that you've sent and I know I don't deserve them, but I certainly enjoyed them. You're a wonderful group of people that have been part of my family for 87 years and I'm most proud of all of you. \nLove,", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T11:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T08:53:48.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
