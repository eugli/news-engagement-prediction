He has been charged with first-degree murder and first-degree attempted murder. According to witnesses, Purinton yelled \"get out of my country\" at two 32-year-old Indian men, Srinivas Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani, before he opened fire at Austin's Bar and Grill in the Kansas City suburb on Wednesday evening.\nRelated:\nLatest wave of threats, vandalism rocks Jewish communities\nPhilly vandals damage Jewish gravesites\nMuslim groups raise thousands to repair vandalized Jewish cemetery\nKuchibhotla was killed and Madasani injured. The two had come to the U.S. from India to study, and they worked as engineers at GPS-maker Garmin. A third patron, Ian Grillot, 24, was wounded when he tried to intervene.\nAfter the shooting, Purinton, who is white, drove 70 miles east to an Applebee's restaurant in Clinton, Missouri, where he made the shocking admission to the bartender.\nIn the 911 call, the bartender, Sam Suida, told the dispatcher a man had come into the bar and said he'd done something \"really bad\" and was on the run from the police.\n\"He asked if he could stay with me and my husband, and he wouldn't tell me what he did. I kept asking him, and he said that he would tell me if I agreed to let him stay with me,\" the bartender said. \"Well, I finally got him to tell me and he said, like, that he shot and killed two Iranian people in Olathe....\"\nAuthorities have declined to discuss a possible motive for the attack or to say if they are investigating it as a hate crime. But the incident has raised concern about the treatment of immigrants, who feel targeted by President Donald Trump's promises to ban certain travelers, build a wall along the Mexico border and put \"America first.\"\nDuring Monday's court appearance lasting less than two minutes, Purinton was seen wearing what was described by a sheriff's department spokesman as a \"safety smock,\" assigned to suspects who said something during jail processing that suggested they might do harm to themselves.\nJohnson County sheriff's Master Deputy Rick Howell would not disclose the comment by Purinton that raised concern, but said the suspect would wear the smock until mental health professionals say otherwise.\nAndy Berthelsen, a neighbor of Purinton's for the past 15 years, told the AP that Purinton had become \"a drunken mess\" after his father's death about 18 months ago. He said he doesn't believe the shooting stemmed from hatred, and that it likely resulted from Purinton's physical and mental deterioration.\nThe University of Kansas Health System released a video Sunday of an interview with Grillot, of Grandview, Missouri, who is recovering after a bullet went through his right hand and into his chest.\nGrillot said he had to do something because there were families and children in the bar when the gunfire erupted. Grillot said he is grateful that the attack is bringing the community together and that it is \"awesome honestly to be able to give people a hope that not everybody hates everybody.\"\nAlok Madasani, left, and his wife Reepthi Gangula hold candles during a vigil Sunday, Feb. 26, 2017, at the Ball Conference Center in Olathe, Kan., held in response to the deadly shooting Wednesday. Adam Purinton was arrested hours after the attack and accused of shooting two Indian immigrants and a third man at a bar, in what some believe was a hate crime. Alok Madasani was injured during the attack. (Photo: Allison Long, AP)\nMadasani addressed a crowd of hundreds during a vigil Sunday night at the Ball Conference Center in Olathe, Kansas.\nHe described the killing of Kuchibhotla, his friend and co-worker, as \"a senseless crime,\" the Kansas City Star reported .\n\"The main reason why I am here is that's what my best friend, Srinivas, would have done,\" Madasani said. \"He would have been here for me.\"\n\"I wish it was a dream,\" Madasani said.\nStill walking on crutches, Madasani drew applause when he called the shooting \"an isolated incident that doesn't reflect the true spirit of Kansas, the Midwest and the United States.\"\nAt the vigil, Madasani recalled how Kuchibhotla never complained about picking him up and driving him to work for six months.\n\"He waited till I bought a car. That's the kind of guy he was — is,\" Madasani said.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/02/27/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/636238226723171538-AP-Bar-Shooting-Kansas-MOKAS.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fea99f25c3e460c0f1e77214e65795cd3db796b4/c=0-326-2880-2491&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2017/02/27/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/636238226723171538-AP-Bar-Shooting-Kansas-MOKAS.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/50117b4bfe181f32492ec4d414638d7c08e560e6/r=500x400/local/-/media/2017/02/27/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/636238226723171538-AP-Bar-Shooting-Kansas-MOKAS.jpg", "http://bit.ly/2mkJVIS"], "published": "2017-02-28T09:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:00:17.952+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
