Police would later delete the image.\nHigh hopes dashed: Buschick, an honor student in high school, majored in special education at Miami University and aspired to work with people with intellectual disabilities\nTight-knit bunch: Erica, pictured far left, was the youngest of three sisters. The image above shows Donna and Eric Buschick with their three daughters\nWhen the roommate woke up the next morning, she found Buschick cold to the touch and still lying on the chair in the same position as the night before, which prompted her to call 911.\nPolice officers were summoned to the dormitory just before 9am on January 20, and Buschick was pronounced dead a short time later.\nThe Butler County Coroner’s office has not released a toxicology report as of Friday morning, but investigators have suggested that 'high-risk alcohol consumption' most likely contributed to Erica Buschick’s death.\nThe student’s father, Eric Buschick, told Chicago Tribune he was on his way home from an out-of-state business trip when he got the worst phone call of his life.\n‘She was my baby girl,’ the devastated father-of-three said or Erica, adding that while he does not blame anyone for her death, he would like Miami University to take steps in order to make sure that what happened to his daughter would not happen to anyone else.\nMiami University President Gregory Crawford said in a statement that he will undertake a ‘holistic assessment’ of the school's effort to curtail binge-drinking among students.\nThe youngest of three daughters, Erica dreamed of becoming a special education teacher.\nDaddy's little girl: Eric Buschick, pictured here next to his youngest daughter, Erica, back in 2013, said he wants her university to take steps in order to curb drinking among students\nAccording to her father, helping people with developmental disables had been her passion from the time she was a student at Warren Township High School, from which she graduated as a member of the National Honor Society.\nWhen she entered Miami University last fall, she declared special education as her major and joined a local chapter of Best Buddies - a volunteer organization helping people with intellectual disabilities.\nErica is survived by her parents, Eric and Donna, and two older sisters, Loren and Danielle.\nTwo days after Erica's death, Loren Buschick posted an impassioned tribute to her 'extraordinary' baby sister.\n‘Erica was not just my little sister, she was my best friend, my other half, my everything,’ she wrote. ‘My world revolved around her. Making her laugh, making her happy and making sure she was succeeding.'", "external_links": ["http://miamistudent.net/mupd-releases-incident-report-on-student-death/", "http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/lake-county-news-sun/news/ct-lns-gurnee-student-death-report-st-0210-20170209-story.html"], "published": "2017-02-10T18:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T02:07:52.912+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
