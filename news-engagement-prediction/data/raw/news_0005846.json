I told them I was determined to see Danny beat Anthony Mundine and be part of the victory and I’m sure that’s what made me well again. media_camera Angelo Hyder is convinced Danny Green will win on Friday night. \n“Danny might say he’s prepared to win on points over 10 rounds but, mate, he’s going in there against Mundine to score a knockout. Mundine has been stopped by lighter punches than Danny before. \n“Danny couldn’t catch him cleanly in their first fight (at Sydney Football Stadium in 2006) but I think this time it will be different. If Danny lands the big one Mundine knows it’s all over.” \nIt was almost all over for Hyder on November 22 when a tree fell on him during land clearing on a property at Kingscliff on the NSW north coast. \n“Lucky my wife Leanne was with me and she had medic training years ago in the army,” he said. \n“I was rushed to the Gold Coast Hospital but I had shocking injuries. \n“The tree had crushed me, it had almost pierced my brain and cut the nerves to my eye. It broke my jaw and busted my cheekbone and forehead and fractured my leg. \n“I’ve got seven plates in my head now and I’ll be on crutches for a fair while. My energy levels are very low and I will need a good sleep before Friday night’s fight to make sure I’m on the ball when the first bell goes.” \nHyder said he was still able to supervise Green’s training as former amateur champion David Birchell did most of the pad work and conditioning coach Ray Franklin looked after Green’s strength and fitness routines. media_camera Angelo Hyder reflected on a near-death experience. \n“In some ways I preferred to sit back and watch Greeny working out from a distance to spot any flaws,” Hyder said. \n“I’m very happy with where he is at physically and mentally. \n“It’s been 11 years since their first fight and Danny has had a lot of time to think about ways to improve his performance against Mundine. I think he’ll settle the score on Friday night.” \nMundine said he suspected Green would try and “jump” him early and score a quick KO as he did against all-time great Roy Jones Jr in 2009 in a fight that ended in the first round. \n“I have to be ready for everything,” Mundine said. \n“I was on my A-game when I beat him the first time and I have to bring my A-game on Friday night. Green can fight, man, and he can punch.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T15:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T06:01:58.130+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
