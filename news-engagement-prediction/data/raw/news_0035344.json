Elijah E. Cummings canceled a scheduled meeting with him. \nRelated: All The Craziness From Drumpf's Presser \nDuring the presser, Trump said: \n\"I was all set to have that meeting. We called him and called him. Very nice guy. He wanted it, but we called, called, called, called. They can't make a meeting with him. Every day I walk in I say, 'I would like to meet with him, because I do want to solve the problem.' But he probably was told by [Sen. Chuck] Schumer [of New York] or somebody like that — some other lightweight — he was probably told, 'Don't meet with Trump. It's bad politics.' And that's part of the problem with this country.\" \nWell, the truth is that shit never happened. \nCummings himself addressed the issue after the press conference, posting a letter online that read in part: \n\"I have no idea why President Trump would make up a story about me like he did today. Of course, Senator Schumer never told me to skip a meeting with the President.\" \nWe have no idea why Drumpf would make this up either. Perhaps it's because he's a compulsive liar with a very short memory? Or because he's self-aggrandizing to the point of being delusional? Or maybe because he has no ethical principals, just a lust for power? \nJust some possibilities. \nVideo: Seth Meyers Finds Trump's Losing Streak HILARIOUS! \nCummings further stated: \n\"I was actually looking forward to meeting with the President about the skyrocketing price of prescription drugs. What I have been doing for the past several weeks is working closely with my partner on these efforts, Senator Bernie Sanders. My goal was to finalize our proposal to allow HHS to negotiate lower drug prices so I could present it to the President. The President has said many times that he supports this proposal, so I wanted to have our bill ready to get his support.\" \nHmm, if 45 supports the proposal, why would he make it so difficult to meet with him by making up all these lies? \nNothing makes sense about this lunatic!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T06:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:59:44.483+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
