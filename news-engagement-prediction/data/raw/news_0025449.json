City Councilman Jose Huizar , taught middle school as part of the Teach for America program between 2005 and 2008. She most recently served as executive director for Coro Southern California, a public affairs training institute. \nThe 30-second ad, which began running on TV and cable channels Monday, ends by urging voters to elect Hernandez and \"take Trump back to school.\" \nHernandez is one of 23 candidates vying for the congressional seat left empty when Xavier Becerra was sworn in as attorney general. \nWith seven weeks to go before the April 4 primary, it's relatively early for expensive broadcast ads to be on air, even with the compressed timeline of the special election. \nBut Hernandez likely has money to burn: in the last three weeks of December, Hernandez raised more than $200,000, second in place behind Assemblyman Jimmy Gomez, who raised more than $300,000.
