For years we've have 5.1 and 7.1 surround sound systems, but now that's all set to change with the mainstream arrival of Dolby Atmos. \nDolby Atmos has the potential to make as significant a change to the audio aspect of home cinema that Blu-ray did to the visuals when it was introduced, and subsequently 4K Ultra HD when that arrived to succeed it. It could even become something synonymously associated with general home cinema, not just in the mid- to high-end. \nBut what is Dolby Atmos? And why is it getting audiophiles and cinephiles excited? What is Dolby Atmos? \nDolby Atmos takes the longstanding 5.1 surround sound but adds extra height channels to provide a more enveloping sound effect in your room. Rather than have sounds of raindrops, or a helicopter moving around the same height as your ears with 5.1 for example, with Atmos you'll be able to hear rain falling from above or a helicopter moving from over your head and over into the distance. At least, that's the theory. \nIt introduces new speaker configurations, such as 5.1.4, where there are five speakers around the room, one subwoofer and four height channel speakers. You could also have 5.1.2, 7.1.2 or 7.1.4. If you want some extra low-end grunt, you can also add an extra subwoofer into the mix. \nBecause Dolby Atmos is an object-based sound format, when creating a soundtrack to a film, sound mixers are able to specify the exact place they want the sounds to be, as opposed to 'left-channel' or 'right rear-channel' of 5.1 surround soundtracks. \nIn select cinemas around the world that have a full Dolby Atmos speaker setup, speakers are placed along the walls, in the ceiling and even behind the screen to push sound out towards the audience. What do I need to get Dolby Atmos? \nFor the best possible Atmos experience, in-ceiling speakers are the way to go. But not everyone is able to facilitate them, so as a workaround, you can get upward firing Atmos speaker modules to bounce the sound up to the ceiling and back down to the listening positions. Dolby \nOnkyo, for example, has the SKH-410 speakers and KEF has the R50s, that you place on top of your existing left and right floorstanders, or nearby on an AV stand. These are dedicated to Dolby Atmos and are angled slightly to bounce the sound off the ceiling and back down to a sitting position comfortably back from the screen or TV. \nAnd don't worry if you don't have Onkyo or KEF speakers for your main setup at the moment, as the modules will play nice with anything you already have. \nIn order to drive your speakers, whether they're upward firing modules or built-in to the ceiling, you'll need a compatible AV receiver. When Atmos first launched around 2014, only a select few models could support the sound format, and it was usually the high-end and most expensive ones at that. \nFortunately, as the format has increased in popularity, the majority of major AV brands have now added Atmos support the main bulk of their ranges, and all at different price points to suit different budgets. \nOnkyo, Sony, Pioneer, Marantz, Denon, Yamaha all have Dolby Atmos AV receivers, so if you wish to remain loyal to a particular brand when upgrading your home system, you can. What Dolby Atmos soundbars are available? \nBut we've been talking as if we're assuming you have space for a full Atmos surround sound setup. What if you want the added height effect but space is at a premium? With a Dolby Atmos soundbar, that's how. \nYamaha was first out the gates with the YSP-5600, but since then, Samsung, Onkyo, Philips and Sony have all produced models. While they won't be able to completely emulate a proper Atmos speaker configuration, they're certainly not far behind and are a real step up from conventional soundbars. \nLG announced at CES 2017 that Dolby Atmos support would be coming to all of its OLED TVs this year. If you watch some content on any of the new OLED screens that has an Atmos soundtrack attached to it, the TV will be able to send the information to a compatible AV receiver or soundbar. The company's ultra-thin Signature OLED W meanwhile comes with its own Dolby Atmos soundbar as standard. It's based on the SJ9 model , also unveiled at CES, but also acts as a media box for connecting various sources. \nSony used CES 2017 to introduce the HT-ST5000 Dolby Atmos soundbar that also comes with Google Home voice-controlled support.
