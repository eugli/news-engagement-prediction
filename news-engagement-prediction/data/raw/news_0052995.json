Here's everything we know so far. \nEditor's Note: This story was updated on Feb. 22 with more details. \nThe Samsung Galaxy S8 is going to be one of the hottest phones of the year, and it's a critical one for Samsung. With the Galaxy Note 7 being pulled from the market (and many people confusing the Note 7 with the non-exploding Galaxy S7), Samsung needs the Galaxy S8 to bring back its sales and cement its position. \nRumors are flying, and sometimes they contradict each other. The Galaxy S8 will obviously be a large, slab-style Android 7.0 Nougat phone. But beyond that, everything's up for grabs. Here's what we've been hearing around the Web about the Galaxy S8 so far. When Is the Galaxy S8's Release Date? \nSamsung exec DJ Koh confirmed to Reuters that the Galaxy S8 will not be announced at the Mobile World Congress trade show at the end of February. However, Korean press reports say that the official launch date may be teased at the end of Samsung's press conference on February 26. \nEvan Blass at VentureBeat says the phone will be announced on March 29 and go on sale April 21. What Are its Price and Carriers? \nWe don't anticipate any surprises with pricing and carrier options for the Galaxy S8. It'll probably cost the same as the Galaxy S7 did, around $650-700 for the base model, and $750-800 if there is a larger model. It will initially be announced in locked versions for each US carrier, with an unlocked version to follow. \nA report from SamMobile says that the prices in Ukraine will be $950 and $1050 . However, phones are somewhat more expensive in Ukraine than they are in the U.S. For instance, the 32GB iPhone 7 costs $869 there, while it costs $649 here. So that $950/$1050 in Ukraine could easily be $750/$850 in the U.S. What Are its Specs and Features? \nWell, for one thing, it won't explode. Samsung posted a YouTube video (above) emphasizing how heavily they're testing this phone. The Wall Street Journal also reports that Samsung may be going to Sony batteries , although the battery manufacturer probably won't matter from a consumer perspective. \nThe most recent round of rumors comes from Android Police : Rear-mounted fingerprint sensor, to the left of the camera lens No physical home button Lots of sensors across the top A \"Dex\" dock which turns the phone into an Android-powered desktop computer \nBefore that, we heard from Evan Blass at VentureBeat : A \"force touch\" screen able to differentiate between keypress strengths A rear 12-megapixel camera and a front 8-megapixel camera 5.8- and 6.2-inch screens with a tall, narrow 18.5:9 aspect ratio 3000 and 3500mAh batteries ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T11:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T07:26:08.760+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
