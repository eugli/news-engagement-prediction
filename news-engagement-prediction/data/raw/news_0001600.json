Parliament backs Government's Article 50 bill \nMr Corbyn seemingly struggled to contain his party’s revolt after Dawn Butler quit as shadow equalities minister and Rachael Maskell resigned as shadow environment secretary just hours before the crucial vote. \nAnd 10 Labour junior shadow ministers and three whips, who are supposed to enforce party discipline, voted against triggering Article 50. \nThe frontbenchers were shadow sport minister Rosena Allin-Khan, shadow culture minister Kevin Brennan, shadow police minister Lyn Brown, shadow housing minister Karen Buck, shadow crime minister Rupa Huq, shadow Northern Ireland minister Stephen Pound, shadow housing minister Andy Slaughter, shadow foreign office minister Catherine West, shadow energy minister Alan Whitehead and shadow transport minister Daniel Zeichner. Ken Clarke: The former chancellor was the only Conservative MP to vote against the bill (PA) \nThe whips were Thangam Debbonaire, Vicky Foxcroft and Jeff Smith. \nBut Theresa May’s Bill was still passed with an overwhelming majority of 384. \nIt will be scrutinised during its committee stage next week – during which the Labour party is set to demand changes to existing legislation.
