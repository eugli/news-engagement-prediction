He had been disciplined previously for having alcohol on the job, and for unauthorized leave.\nOn Nov. 11, 2015, he hit a sign on a highway off-ramp, and left the scene.\nHe says he told a co-worker Nov. 12 about a court appearance the following day, and joked if he didn't show up for work \"it will be because I'm in jail.\"\nHe never returned to work.\nHe pleaded guilty the next day to having care and control of a vehicle while impaired. Because of his prior convictions, he was remanded pending sentencing, and later sentenced to six months in jail.\nLynch said he never had a chance to use a phone to contact his employer, and that no one came to his hearing who could have made the call for him.\nIn his absence, the hospital sent him two registered letters -- one asking for an explanation, and the second a month later firing him.\n\"The employer has failed to prove just cause for termination,\" McEvoy said in his ruling. \"It would have been relatively easy for the employer to communicate with Lynch once the rumours of his arrest were known.\"\nMcEvoy ordered Lynch reinstated, and noted the hospital must give him an \"appropriate orientation period to familiarize himself once again with his duties.\"\nMcEvoy said inmates should have the right to contact their employers when held in custody.\n\"No one who is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for a limited term in New Brunswick should face the Kafka-like situation faced by Lynch in respect of his inability to contact his employer. Here, citizens taken into custody by police and Corrections staff do not seemingly 'disappear' as did Lynch,\" said McEvoy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:11:21.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
