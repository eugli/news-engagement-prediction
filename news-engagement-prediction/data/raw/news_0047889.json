It lasted less than three weeks. Violent, politically-charged clashes at the installation resulted in police monitoring the location 24 hours a day, seven days a week. A clash between LaBeouf and a man who said \" Hitler did nothing wrong \" while pretending to take a selfie with LaBeouf ended in the 30-year old actor's arrest. \nThe Museum of the Moving Image eventually decided to shut down the exhibit and in a statement deemed it a \"flashpoint for violence.\" \nLaBeouf and his partners addressed both the installation's move and the reasons behind its abrupt end at its NYC location in a statement over the weekend. The artists blame the Museum of the Moving Image for \"bowing down to political pressure.\" \"On February 10, 2017, The Museum of the Moving Image abandoned HEWILLNOTDIVIDE.US . Their evident lack of commitment to the project is damning.From the outset, the museum failed to address our concerns about the misleading framing of our piece as a political rally, rather than as a participatory performance artwork resisting the normalisation of division.In fact, the museum demonstrated a spectacular lack of judgement‚Äîand courtesy to us as artists‚Äîby neglecting to consult us when they staged a political rally at the site of our artwork on January 29, 2017.On numerous occasions, we voiced serious concerns to the museum about hate speech occurring at the site of our project, and requested that the museum act responsibly in moderating this and providing the public a means of reporting such incidents. Our requests were not even acknowledged, let alone acted upon.Nonetheless, there had been no incidents of physical violence at the site of our project that we are aware of, nor that we had been informed of at any stage by the museum.It is our understanding that the museum bowed to political pressure in ceasing their involvement with our project. We were only informed of the museum's capitulation in an email from their attorney, Brendan O'Rourke‚Äîa lawyer who we note also represents the current president.It is clear, therefore, that the Museum of the Moving Image is not fit to speak of our intent as artists.As of February 18, 2017, we are proud to be continuing HEWILLNOTDIVIDE.US at the El Rey Theater, Albuquerque.\" \nLaBeouf and an array of artists and supporters tweeted photos and video of the installation's new launch at its New Mexico location: Thank you @thecampaignbook for bringing so many people together in Abq today, and the rest of the days to come. üñ§üå© pic.twitter.com/0MkjKTXhyy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T20:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T17:45:37.677+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
