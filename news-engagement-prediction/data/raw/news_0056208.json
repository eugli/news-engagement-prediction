Incidentally, the member who defected on Wednesday , Mr. Emmanuel Ukoette, is from Akwa Ibom State, a PDP stronghold. The lawmaker said the PDP was in factions to a point he no longer knew whether there was still a political party. “I have decided to join the APC, where there is focus”, he told the session, which was presided over by the Speaker, Mr. Yakubu Dogara. But, his former PDP colleagues did not take kindly to the reason he gave for defecting. They shouted him down and accused him of being a “disappointment” to the PDP. There was more drama when APC lawmakers promptly came to the defence of Ukoette, saying that he had taken the right decision. The Majority Leader of the House, Mr. Femi Gbajabiamila, and the Minority Leader, Mr. Leo Ogor, also exchanged words over the decision of Ukoette. As Ogor raised a point of order and rose to oppose the defection, Dogara took sides with Ukoette and Gbajabiamila. The speaker said, “Before the minority leader speaks, he must first tell us which PDP he belongs to. “Are you in the (Ahmed) Makarfi group or the Sheriff group? Tell us.” But, Ogor, who looked furious, ignored Dogara’s jibes and went on to berate Ukoette for dumping the PDP. He threatened that the party would declare his seat vacant, but Ogor did not say how this would be done. The minority leader spoke more, “The PDP has its internal challenges but we have…“Democracy is not about jumping ship at the slightest opportunity. “This our colleague knows that we are going to declare his seat vacant. “Also, in Akwa Ibom, he knows he can’t win any election in APC.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:31:16.476+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
