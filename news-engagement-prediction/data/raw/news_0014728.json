I am very sad because she was very close to me, she will come to my house everyday to play. \n\"They should have taken matters more seriously because they were mining for bauxite close to a residential area. I will be seeking legal advice before I make my next move,\" he told Bernama when met at his home yesterday. \nAidil, a retired soldier, said that he hoped that his action would serve as a lesson to those out to make a quick profit but were negligent where it comes to people's safety. \nHe also urged the relevant authorities to fill up the pool with earth to prevent a recurrence of such a tragedy. \nRecounting the child's last hours, Aidil said Nureen Ain had lunch with him before asking his wife Wan Zauwiyah Wan Omar, 78, for some pocket money to buy a few things at a nearby shop at 2.30pm (Saturday). \n\"Later I received the shocking news that she had drowned,\" he sobbed. \nIn the incident at 5pm Saturday, Nureen Ain and siblings Salsabila Zuhairi, 12, and Mahathir Mohamad Zuhairi, seven, drowned while playing near the pool. \nDad joins refill protest \nMeanwhile Nureen Ain's father joined the residents in a gimmick to 'refill' the pool yesterday afternoon. \nMohd Sharif Awang Ngah,50, was among 20 residents who carried out the gimmick at 6pm for about 15 minutes to protest against the authorities for taking their safety lightly by leaving the former mines open. \nHe said the action was also to represent all the villagers in the area who are angry with the mine operator for not closing the former mining pool. \n\"I hope the relevant parties, including the state government take immediate steps to refill the pool in the vicinity of the abandoned mine before more bad things happen,\" he told reporters yesterday. \n- Bernama \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T08:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T05:10:41.198+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
