Dog owners are more sexually attractive than people who own cats \nHe also found that it was easy to make the bees whoop – you just had to knock gently on the hive’s wooden wall. \nTo find out more, the scientists placed cameras inside the hive – which is when they discovered that the bees made the noise when they bumped into each other. \n‘We suggest that, in the majority of cases, it is bees being startled that produces the signal,’ Bencsik added.
