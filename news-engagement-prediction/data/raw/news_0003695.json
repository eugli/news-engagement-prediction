But what were the top 10 transfers of this window? \nThis January the rumour mill was turning as frantically as it ever has with the money coming from China making the phrase \"Person X is the latest player linked with a move to China\" the most typed thing on the internet. \nCheck out our video on the transfers that never were XI: \nHowever the Far East wasn't the only place to have all the transfer fun. As is always the case it was a mad scramble all around England today. \nAs men and women in Sky Sports jackets stood in the cold and wet outside of football grounds and training grounds Premier League chairmen were busy in the warmth of their offices sorting out deals. \nBut who were the top 10 most expensive signings of the window? Here's the list according to Transfermarkt : \n1. Oscar, £51 million; Chelsea - Shanghai SIPG : \nThe Chelsea midfielder had previously been linked with a big money move to Juventus but after finding himself out of Antonio Conte's plans he moved to the CSL. He briefly became the highest paid player in the world before Carlos Tevez overtook him. \n2. Julian Draxler, £34 million; Wolfsburg - PSG: \nThe World Cup winner told his team he no longer wanted to play for them and they duly sold him to PSG for a lot of money. The exciting winger has been linked with Arsenal a lot over the years and the French champions have made a top signing. \n3. Gabriel Jesus, £27.2 million; Palmeiras - Manchester City: \nA deal we knew was happening in the summer but only went through at the beginning of the month. Lots is expected of the exciting teenager. Many would argue a forward isn't exactly what Pep Guardiola's team needs but one for the future. \n4. Gonçalo Guedes , £25.5 million; Benfica - PSG: Newly-signed Gonçalo Guedes gives his first interview as a PSG player!! :flag_pt: - PSG English (@PSG_English) January 26, 2017 \nA Benfica player will never move to Manchester United no matter how much you link one to Old Trafford. Guedes was thought to be England bound but it never happened and the forward ended up in France instead. \n5. Dimitri Payet, £25 million; West Ham United - Marseilles: \nHow much West Ham must wish they'd cashed in on Payet in the summer. The Frenchman went on strike at the beginning of the month and finally got his move home at the end of the window, took a pay cut to move but still very much a snake. \n6. Odion Ighalo, £ 19.8 million; Watford - Changchun Yatai : Ighalo (Watford)1 goals in 18 games20 mill pounds to ChinaIt's a funny old game/market/ - Jan Aage Fjortoft (@JanAageFjortoft) January 31, 2017 \nChinese clubs were after Ighalo in the summer for more money but the player didn't want to leave. However the lure of the CSL, or its money anyway, has been too much to turn down. Has suffered from second season syndrome this season. \n7. Morgan Schneiderlin, £19.5 million; Manchester United - Everton: \nNever made it at Old Trafford but could be a very good move for the Toffees. The Frenchman has been reunited with his former Southampton manager Ronald Koeman. Possibly one of the best deals of the window for all involved. \n8. Chengdong Zhang , £17.4 million; Beijing Sinobo Guoan - Hebei China Fortune : Welcome Chengdong Zhang. pic.twitter.com/h07qemzq1I - Hebei CF上河北华夏幸福足球俱乐部 (@HebeiCFFF) January 14, 2017 \nAnother deal for China but this time an underrated one because it's for a Chinese player. Fortune have spent an actual fortune for a right winger who didn't score in the Super League last season so who knows if it's a good deal. \n9. Axel Witsel, £17 million; Zenit St Petersburg - Tianjin Quanjian : \nNot only was the 28 linked with a move to Juventus last summer he was actually on the verge of signing until Zenit pulled out last minute. Would have been expected to sign with the Old Lady in the summer but decided to follow the cash in the East instead. \n10. Leonardo Pavoletti, £15.3 million; Genoa - Napoli: \nWith striker Manolo Gabbiadini moving to Southampton it's not surprise that Napoli brought in a replacement, although surprisingly they ended up spending more on Pavoletti than they made from selling their forward. Has three goals in seven games for Genoa this season. \nSo there you go, it's all over for another few months and we can get back to the actual football! \nWho did you want your team to sign?
