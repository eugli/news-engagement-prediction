But who cares when we have this many movies we need to see in 2017?\nLike the halftime show and the coin toss, Super Bowl trailers are an annual part of the game. This year's crop of spots was not a disappointment. You can watch the trailers below, which range from the ordinary (sorry Transformers ) to the inventive (cheers to you, A Cure for Wellness and John Wick: Chapter 2 ).\nA Cure for Wellness The upcoming horror movie was the best trailer to debut during the game, hands down. It actually had two trailers, one a pretty straightforward affair, but the second is where it shined. The first few seconds of the spot trick you into thinking it's a pharmaceutical ad (complete with stock footage and a soothing voice-over) until it slowly reveals the world of terror the Gore Verbinski-directed movie promises. \"Side effects\" from \"the cure\" include \"self-mutilation, murderous rage and addiction to pain.\" No big deal.\nA Cure For Wellness opens Feb. 17.\nBaywatch We didn't learn anything new about the action-comedy Baywatch reboot , but we're not sorry about it. The short trailer gave us more of what we're already excited about: puns, abs and an American flag speedo. It also has plenty of The Rock plus Zack Efron's abs and even a glance at villain Priyanka Chopra, looking downright stunning.\nBaywatch opens May 26.\nThe Fate of the Furious Do you know what all the other trailers that aired during the game don't have? They don't have The Rock catching a grenade . The trailer for the eighth installment in the Fast and Furious franchise promises just what we want out of one of these films: cars, crazy stunts with cars and lots of Vin Diesel. He may be bad this time, but it looks so good.\nThe Fate of the Furious opens April 14.\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 \"That was awesome.\" Drax (Dave Bautista) is very excited in the ad for the Marvel sequel, and fans should be, too. We know that the movie is going bigger in its second installment, and the trailer teases that, but also the classic rock and humor we loved about the first one. Plus, of course, Baby Groot remains the cutest thing in sci-fi since Wall-E .\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 opens May 5.\nLogan The first trailer for the latest Wolverine flick used Johnny Cash's cover of Hurt to great effect. The Super Bowl spot chose another classic to score it's dystopian imagery: Amazing Grace . The fast-paced trailer gives us lots of moody Hugh Jackman, distressed Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier, and the young girl who appears to be comic book character X-23, a mutant who's quite a bit like Wolverine.\nLogan opens March 3.\nJohn Wick: Chapter 2 The sequel to Keanu Reeves' cult hit about a deadly assassin is squaring off against Fifty Shades Darker at the Valentine's Day weekend box office, and its pre-game ad really leans into the, er, mild differences between the two films. What starts off looking a little like a sultry Fifty Shades spot replaces the sex with quite a bit of violence. Yes, this is definitely something a little \"darker.\"\nJohn Wick: Chapter 2 opens Feb. 10.\nLife This is the rare 30-second spot that gets the whole plot of the movie across simply. Ryan Reynolds and Jake Gyllenhaal go to space . Bad things happen involving some kind of alien life-form. It gets very scary and sweaty. What else do we need to know?\nLife opens March 24.\nPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales Yup, there's another Pirates movie coming , and it's still starring Johnny Depp . The fifth installment in the franchise looks like the rest of the films, except Javier Bardem's villain has a vaguely Edward Scissorhands vibe. It's a very Depp film.\nPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales opens May 26.\nTransformers: The Last Knight Like those pesky pirates, the Transformers just keep coming back to Earth and messing things up. The latest installment in Michael Bay's franchise starts out dark and looks like it will get darker. But, like the rest, there are explosions and robots and special effects and some humans, too.\nTransformers: The Last Knight opens June 23.\nGhost in the Shell Robots are so in right now. Scarlett Johansson stars in the somewhat controversial adaptation of the popular Japanese manga as a butt-kicking cyborg. The quick-cut trailer may not enlighten non-fans, but it contains the action and Asian imagery that the first trailer highlighted.\nGhost in the Shell opens March 31.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/mHxTamHu5yI?feature=oembed", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/IYrdoQAjcww?feature=oembed", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/usatoday/usat-web-static-2817.0/images/social-icons/oval-1-copy-3-email@2x.png", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/usatoday/usat-web-static-2817.0/images/social-icons/oval-1-facebook@2x.png", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/hsiLYJMsiLw?feature=oembed", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/usatoday/usat-web-static-2817.0/images/social-icons/oval-1-copy-3-email.png", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/usatoday/usat-web-static-2817.0/images/social-icons/oval-1-facebook@3x.png", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/-9FU7Ia-BKg?feature=oembed", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/i3wJjLXjySg?feature=oembed", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/2kdONuN&text=The%20best%20Super%20Bowl%20trailers%20from%20%27Baywatch%27%20to%20%27Furious%27%20to%20%27Guardians%27&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/usatoday/usat-web-static-2817.0/images/social-icons/oval-1-facebook.png", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/B4LC8GOdfSE?feature=oembed", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/C29czmGuoNI?feature=oembed", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/usatoday/usat-web-static-2817.0/images/social-icons/oval-1-copy-twitter.png", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/bQN5U7DbJdk?feature=oembed", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/usatoday/usat-web-static-2817.0/images/social-icons/oval-1-copy-twitter@2x.png", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/usatoday/usat-web-static-2817.0/images/social-icons/oval-1-copy-twitter@3x.png", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/CaLNiC-bKHQ?feature=oembed", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/fDnXUq2uV6c?feature=oembed", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/usatoday/usat-web-static-2817.0/images/social-icons/oval-1-copy-3-email@3x.png"], "published": "2017-02-06T23:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T20:02:37.384+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
