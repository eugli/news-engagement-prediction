Science Picture Co, Getty Images By Anne Marie Helmenstine, Ph.D. Updated October 18, 2016 . \nFluorine (F) is an element you encounter daily, most often as fluoride in water and toothpaste. Here are 10 interesting facts about this important element. You can get more detailed information about chemical and physical properties on the fluorine facts page . Fluorine is the most reactive and most electronegative of all the chemical elements. The only elements it doesn't vigorously react with are oxygen, helium, neon, and argon. It is one of the few elements that will form compounds with noble gases xenon, krypton, and radon. Fluorine is the lightest halogen , with atomic number 9. The pure non-metallic element is a gas at room temperature and pressure. George Gore managed to isolate fluorine using an electrolytic process in 1869, but the experiment ended in disaster when fluorine reacted explosively with hydrogen gas. Henri Moisson was awarded the 1906 Nobel Prize for Chemistry for isolating fluorine in 1886. He also used electrolysis to obtain the element, but kept the fluorine gas separate from the hydrogen gas. Although he was the first to successfully obtain pure fluorine, Moisson's work was interrupted multiple times when he was poisoned by the reactive element. Moisson was also the first person to make artificial diamonds, by compressing charcoal. \ncontinue reading below our video 4 Tips for Improving Test Performance The 13th most abundant element in the Earth's crust is fluorine. It is so reactive that it is not found naturally in pure form, but only in compounds. The element is found in minerals, including fluorite, topaz, and feldspar. Fluorine has many uses. It is found as fluoride in toothpaste and drinking water, in Teflon (polytetrafluoroethylene), drugs including the chemotherapeutic drug 5-fluorouracil, and etchant hydrofluoric acid. It is used in refrigerants (chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs), propellants, and for enrichment of uranium by UF 6 gas. Because it is so reactive, fluorine is difficult to store. Hydrofluoric acid (HF), for example, is so corrosive it will dissolve glass. Even so, HF is safer and easier to transport and handle than pure fluorine. Although fluorine is relatively common on Earth, it is rare in the universe, believed to be found at concentrations of about 400 parts per billion. While fluorine forms in stars, nuclear fusion with hydrogen produces helium and oxygen or fusion with helium makes neon and hydrogen. Fluorine is one of the few elements that can attack diamond. Fluorine changes from an extremely pale yellow diatomic gas (F 2 ) into a bright yellow liquid at -188 °C (-307 °F). Light fluorine resembles another liquid halogen, chlorine. There is only one stable isotope of fluorine, F-19.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:50:00.326+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
