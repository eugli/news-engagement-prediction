In time, it may kill them. \nGlenarm Wood outside the County Antrim village of the same name has probably the best oak wood in Northern Ireland. Image caption Haloing entails the cutting away of other trees around the oaks to give them space \nIt has between 400 and 500 specimen oaks considered \"ancient or veteran\". 'The armpits' \nAncient oaks are those considered to be at least 500-years-old. \nUlster Wildlife leases the wood from the Glenarm Estate. \nReserves manager Andrew Crory says the younger trees are \"basically growing up through the armpits\" of the oaks. Image caption Oaks are sensitive to crowding \n\"You can imagine if someone kept poking you again and again, you would start getting a bit annoyed,\" he said. \nEventually the trees start to retreat, with lower branches dying off, until the entire tree dies. \nMr Crory explained that it is not only the trees that are at risk, but the scores of species of plant, insect and animal life that live within each one. \n\"If an oak dies, where do all the invertebrates, the fungi, the beetles, the mosses and the lichens go? \n\"They need that tree at a certain stage of growth. \n\"So the whole ecology of those oak trees will be lost as well.\" Image caption Conservationists use the haloing technique to protect the trees", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T13:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T05:06:52.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
