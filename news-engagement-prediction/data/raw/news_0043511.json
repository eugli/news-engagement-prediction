The National Pension Scheme (NPS), a retirement saving scheme launched by the government, has drawn many investors as it allows an additional tax deduction of Rs 50,000 under Section 80CCD (1b). The fund under this voluntary scheme is invested in a mix of equity and debt securities depending on the investorsâ€™ choice or his/her age in case of no preference.\nAlthough, there is no upper limit to the amount you can invest with NPS, the minimum is Rs. 6,000 per year.\nRecent Developments: Taxation of NPS & Tax Savings\nAccording to developments in the Union Budget 2017, no tax would be imposed on partial withdrawals amounting to less than 25% of the investment made towards your NPS fund. For example, if you have contributed Rs 3 lakh towards NPS and the fund value stands at Rs 4 lakh at present, you are exempted from tax on withdrawal of Rs 75,000.\nAccording to the new government proposal, the corporate-employed and self-employed are taxed equally. While earlier the self-employed were allowed deduction on the 10% of the income contributed towards NPS, they are now exempted up to 20% of their income. In case of corporate employees, 10% is contributed by the employee and 10% is provided by the employer. However, the employee enjoys tax deduction on the joint contribution.\nYou may also watch:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T21:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T16:14:34.872+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
