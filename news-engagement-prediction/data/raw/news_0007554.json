In the Czech Republic, the man to beat is Andrej Babis, a media mogul and billionaire who is also the country’s finance minister. His ANO (“Yes”) party is far ahead in the polls, and he is favoured to win national elections in October. On January 11th the rest of the Czech political establishment teamed up against Mr Babis, passing a law that would ban cabinet ministers from owning media firms or more than a quarter of any company pursuing state contracts or European Union subsidies. The law received an overwhelming 72% of the vote in parliament. \nIf the aim was to drive Mr Babis out of politics, it does not appear to have worked. On January 29th he confirmed he would comply with the law by placing his business holdings in a trust. “I am really excited about the moment when neither you nor any other journalist can ask me about my companies because they won’t be mine anymore,” Mr Babis wrote in an e-mail. The law may in fact have strengthened his position, by helping him to portray himself as a political outsider. Related topics Andrej Babis \nThere was never any doubt about the law’s target: even its supporters refer to it as “Lex Babis”. “[Mr Babis] is the one and only person who would really be impacted,” says Petr Leyer, a lawyer with the Czech branch of Transparency International. Mr Babis’s conglomerate, Agrofert, employs 33,000 people in 250 separate firms, including two newspapers, a radio station and a music-television channel. Opponents started discussing the legislation over a year ago, worried that Mr Babis could use his media empire to make his political position impregnable. \nYet Mr Babis does not owe his popularity entirely to fawning coverage from his own papers. He is a deft campaigner, and his record in office has been good. The Czech Republic ran a budget surplus last year. Its unemployment rate of 3.7% is the lowest in the EU, and GDP grew by an estimated 2.5% in 2016, well above the European average. Mr Babis’s trademark legislative achievement, mandating electronic cash registers to combat VAT fraud, is no populist pablum; indeed it agitated small-business entrepreneurs such as bar and restaurant owners. Mr Babis took care to blunt the political impact. As the law went into effect last December, he appeared at a local tavern, cameras in tow, calming nerves by ordering a round of shots for the house. \nSo far, other politicians’ attacks on Mr Babis’s business dealings and potential conflicts of interest have missed the mark. ANO finished second in the 2013 election, and recent polls put its support at about 30%, nearly double that of its closest competitor and coalition partner, the Social Democrats, led by Bohuslav Sobotka, the current prime minister. \nThe Lex Babis will come into effect on February 9th, an unusually rapid implementation in the Czech system. Mr Babis has a team of lawyers restructuring Agrofert to ensure that he can run in the October election and that the firm remains eligible for EU subsidies and government contracts. “Unlike President Trump, I will not appoint family members” to manage the new trust, he said in a television interview. He has also vowed to file a complaint with the European Commission, arguing that his right to do business in the common market has been violated. He has an ally in Milos Zeman, the Czech president, who tried to block the Lex Babis (parliament overrode his veto). Many of Mr Zeman’s own advisers have potential conflict-of-interest problems, and he intends to challenge the law in the constitutional court. \nMr Babis’s pledge to place his holdings in a trust does not guarantee transparency. Among other things, Czech trust law dates from just 2014. Some of the rules are lax; they include a bizarre provision allowing a single person to act as a trust’s settlor, trustee and beneficiary—perhaps even Mr Babis himself. In the end, voters will probably have to take his word that he has cut ties to Agrofert. In the meantime, the Lex Babis helps its target to argue that he is an upstart challenging the system, and that the old guard is united against him.
