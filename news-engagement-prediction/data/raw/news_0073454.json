The amount of tuition help will decrease as a student's family income increases, until it reaches a maximum income cut-off point.\nTuition at New Brunswick post-secondary institutions averages about $6,200 a year.\nFree tuition for low-income students squeezes middle class, critics say Students launch complaint against province over bursary program \"This new program make post-secondary education more accessible â€¦ for New Brunswick students,\" said Gallant.\nFamilies that fall under the program include:\nA family of one or two making up to $75,000 a year. A family of three making $90,000 a year a year. A family of four making up to $100,000 a year. A family of five making up to $108,500 a year. A family of six making up to $116,500 a year. A family of seven earning up to $123,500 a year.\nThe program will be available starting Aug. 1 to New Brunswick students who meet the criteria. Applications for financial aid are expected to be available by June 1.\nUnder examples provided by the government, a student from a family of three with an income of $61,000 would be eligible for a bursary of $3,614. The bursary and a Canada student grant of $2,461 would cover 98 per cent of tuition, the province said.\nA student from a family of five with an income of $105,000 would be eligible for $379 from the province. The bursary and a $945 Canada student grant would cover 21 per cent of tuition.\nThe new program is an addition to financial assistance programs already offered to New Brunswick students, including the tuition access bursary, which was announced in 2016 to help students from families earning less than $60,000 attend a publicly funded college or university.\nIn 2015, the Gallant government received backlash from the public for cutting New Brunswick's tuition rebate program, which could reach a maximum of $20,000 for graduates who stayed in the province and worked after graduation.\nTwo student groups welcomed the new bursary program as a step forward.\n\"We are pleased to hear that the Department of Post-Secondary Education, Training and Labour is listening to students and increasing financial accessibility,\" UNB Student Union president Travis Daley said in a statement.\nThe head of the New Brunswick Student Alliance predicted students would be celebrating the program.\n\"We have been pushing the government for almost a year now to include a progressive income threshold for their up-front grants program,\" Robert Burroughs, the executive director, said in a news release.\nGallant also announced the province will provide health-care coverage to international students at New Brunswick universities and community colleges to help with out-of-pocket expenses.\nBurroughs said the move would help New Brunswick recruit international students and would \"play a big part in supporting the retention and post-graduation transition of these students.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T05:29:42.966+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
