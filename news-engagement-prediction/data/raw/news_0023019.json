When I was the chief minister, I got it done.” \nMs. Bharti, who is Union Water Resources Minister, provided graphic details on how rapists should be tortured. “Rapists should be hung upside down. They should be beaten till their skin comes off. Also, salt and chilly should be rubbed on their skin, especially on their wounds, till they scream and beg for forgiveness. This is what I had done when I was the CM,” she said. Ms. Bharti, who is in the news for her intemperate remarks, was the CM of Madhya Pradesh from 2003 to 2004. \nShe went on to say how, when a police officer objected to the torture of rapists on grounds of violation of human rights, she had said that rapists have no human rights. “I told the police officer that people who behave like danav (demons) do not deserve human rights. Their heads should be cut off like Ravana’s,” she told the gathering in Agra.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T04:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T02:13:24.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
