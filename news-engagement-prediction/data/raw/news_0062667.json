South Korea’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Friday expressing “shock” at the use of a chemical weapon and vowed to work with the international society to deal “strongly” with the violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention. The deadly use of a chemical weapon banned by international conventions in a such a public manner could strengthen calls for the United States to put North Korea back on a list of terrorism-sponsoring countries, analysts said. The North was first put on the terrorist list after its bombing of a South Korean airliner near Myanmar in 1987, killing all 115 people onboard. But the United States delisted the country in 2008 as part of an agreement aimed at ending North Korea’s nuclear programs — a deal that has since disintegrated with the North’s subsequent missile and nuclear weapons tests.

Credit Fuji TV, via Reuters After his announcement that Mr. Kim had been killed by VX nerve agent , Khalid Abu Bakar, the inspector general of the Malaysian police, said on Friday that small amounts of the poison could have been brought into the country without being discovered. “If the amount of the chemical brought in was small, it would be difficult for us to detect,” Mr. Khalid told reporters. The airport terminal, which handles more than two million passengers a month, will be decontaminated despite the passage of time since the killing, he said. Two women have been arrested in the killing, one from Indonesia and the other from Vietnam. Their defenders say they were duped into carrying out the attack and thought it was a prank, but Mr. Khalid said they had trained for the attack and practiced it at two major shopping malls. The women used their bare hands to apply the poison on Mr. Kim’s face and washed them immediately afterward, he said. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story One drop of VX, or about 10 milligrams, can be fatal. But the attackers could have used a safety-enhancing battlefield form of the agent. Known as VX2, it is divided into two compounds that are harmless individually but become lethal when mixed together. Each component also could have been made in slow-release form, as is done with many drugs. If Mr. Kim’s two assassins had each applied one component of VX, this would explain why two assassins were needed, how they survived the attack, and perhaps why it took 15 minutes or more for Mr. Kim to die.
