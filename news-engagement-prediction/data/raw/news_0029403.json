He is one of 14 attackers who were detained in Sittwe township,\" the officer said, naming the man as Mamahdnu Aka Aula.\nThe other 13 people also appeared in court but have yet to be sentenced, he added.\nThan Tun, the leader of an aid organisation operating in northern Rakhine, confirmed the sentence, adding: \"He is the first one to face such action since the attack.\"\nMyanmar's government said hundreds of Rohingya militants carried out raids on three posts on the Bangladesh border on Oct 9, killing nine police in a series of coordinated attacks.\nThe International Crisis Group think-tank has said the attackers were a Saudi-backed group called Harakah al-Yaqin, which it said had spent years recruiting and training fighters in Bangladesh and northern Rakhine.\nThe sentencing comes days after a blistering report from the UN accused Myanmar's troops and police of carrying out a campaign of rape, torture and mass killings of Rohingya.\nBased on interviews with hundreds of escapees in Bangladesh, investigators said the military's \"calculated policy of terror\" very likely amounted to ethnic cleansing.\nSeveral hundred Rohingya have also been detained, the UN report said, describing how they were stripped, beaten, tortured and deprived of food and water.\nMyanmar's government has pledged to investigate the allegations after spending months dismissing similar reports from international media and rights groups as \"fake news\".\nThe 1.1 million Rohingya are loathed by many from the Buddhist majority, who insist they are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh even though many have lived in the country for generations.\nThe recent violence has sparked criticism that Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi has done little to help them since taking office almost a year ago.\n- AFP/ek\nEmail More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T03:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T14:35:41.513+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
