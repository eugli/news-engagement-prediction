Seven Earth-sized worlds orbiting a cool dwarf star known as TRAPPIST-1 (Photo: PA) \nNo other star system known contains such a large number of Earth-sized and probably rocky planets. \n\"The discovery of multiple rocky planets with surface temperatures which allow for liquid water make this amazing system an exciting future target in the search for life,\" said British astronomer Dr Chris Copperwheat, from Liverpool John Moores University, who co-led the international team.

Liverpool John Moores University's robotic telescope (Photo: PA) \nIt was one of a number of ground-based instruments that supported observations made by American space agency Nasa's orbiting Spitzer telescope. \nThe Liverpool telescope helped detect the planets as they passed in front of their star.
