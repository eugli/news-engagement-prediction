The show's organizer Arjun Jain, director of White Fox India, says, \" Justin Bieber is the biggest mainstream artiste of our time and attracts fans across all ages. This tour is one of the most successful in the world at the moment and will further enhance India's current repertoire on the global map. We envisage one of the biggest live events of the year.\" \n\nApart from India, the Asia leg of the tour includes Tel Aviv in Israel and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates before Bieber arrives in India. Opening acts are likely to feature Sean Paul, Martin Garrix and Sean Kingston. \n\nTickets for Bieber's Mumbai jaunt, in support of his fourth album 'Purpose' that was critically acclaimed and marked his move from bubble-gum pop to a mature zone, will go on sale from February 22.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T11:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T03:13:35.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
