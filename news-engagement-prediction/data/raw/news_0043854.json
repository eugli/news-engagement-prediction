Audio: Kelpie breeder Julie Turner gives Lara Webster a crash course in genetic selection (ABC News) \nMs Turner owns 20 dogs, and they are the main farm hands. \nThe family relies only on those dogs and bikes for all of their cattle work on Hillview Station at Clermont. \n\"They have got to have traceable ancestry,\" Ms Turner said. \n\"You have got to be able to go back and find a line, whether it be three, four or five [generations back] … as far as you can go back to get that good line. \n\"I love the bigger type of dogs, the bigger frames, the bigger bones, bigger head and a dog has to have presence … that is something you really need to have.\" \nThe term presence refers to a certain aura the dog gives off when working cattle. \n\"You send a dog around a mob and they just send off a vibe that the cattle know they are fair dinkum [and] move it,\" Ms Turner explained. Good genetics a valuable business \nJust like cattle, horses or sheep, good breeding in the dog world comes with a price tag. \n\"Some dogs will be fetching $12,000–$14,000 but if the dog is a beautiful dog — which it would have to be for that amount of money — the genetics are all there and you can get a litter of pups or breed that dog [and] breed that genetic base on,\" Ms Turner said. \n\"The amount of work that dog will do over a lifetime is immeasurable money-wise.\" \nHowever, breeding alone may not determine value because colour can also play a big part in how much money a person is willing to part with for their kelpie pup. \nYellow kelpies are often sought-after because they are fairly uncommon. \n\"To get the yellow, both of the parents have to carry the yellow gene, so when you join both parents they will throw yellow pups,\" Ms Turner said. \n\"Usually one in about 20 pups are born yellow.\" \nTheir red counterparts are also popular, particularly following the Red Dog films . \n\"Red dogs are very high in demand. Everyone wants a plain red dog or a plain black dog and if they cannot get that, well, they just want a kelpie,\" Ms Turner said. \nThe Clermont-bred kelpies have been sent to almost every state in Australia. \n\"I don't think I've sent any to Western Australia, but I have sent a couple to the Northern Territory and a couple down to Victoria just before Christmas,\" Ms Turner said. \n\"These seven puppies I have now are all sold and a couple of them are going to Victoria and a few will go to the Sydney area, all on farms.\" \nThe kelpies are bred to work, and they do that very well. \n\"Any of us here can go out and do a job on our own … it just makes life so much easier,\" Ms Turner said. \n\"There is no running horses in, no saddling horses or feeding horses. You just have a bike to maintain and the dogs to look after.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T04:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T05:15:29.202+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
