Thaipusam draws visitors from all over the world and we should not portray this condemned symbol as part of our culture,\" he said in a statement today. \nHe said the role of the police during Thaipusam was to maintain law and order and to ensure that devotees and visitors alike were ensured of their safety and well-being. \n\"This is our utmost priority and we cannot allow a group of youths to put fear in devotees and visitors,\" he added. \nMior Faridalathrash said police arrested a group of 20 youths during the Thaipusam celebration in George Town for various criminal offences, including robbery and drug use. \n\"Since the arrests, some of them including three students were released on police bail,\" he said. \nHe issued the statement in response to Penang PKR Youth vice-head A Kumaresan who said that the wing regretted the actions of the police in arresting the 20 individuals in relation to the kavadi bearing the Nazi symbol. \nKumaresan had said that the police should have first referred the matter to the Hindu authorities before taking such action. \n- Bernama \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T17:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T13:08:36.062+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
