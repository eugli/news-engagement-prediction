Emma Wore Organic Wool Trousers For The First Public Screening Of Beauty And The Beast \nFor the debut public screening of Beauty and the Beast Emma decided to rock a unique look while in Paris, Belle's birthplace.

Her shoes were (naturally) handmade in Italy with organic silk for Burberry. Emma Wore A Dress Made From Recycled Plastic Bottles On The Second Day Of Her Press Tour \nMoving away from natural materials, Emma managed to sneak out of the Beauty and the Beast press junket to pose for some photos in her custom Louis Vuitton dress.
