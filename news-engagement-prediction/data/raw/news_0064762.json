The recommendation for formation of the Bundelkhand state was sent to the central government but no action was taken by the previous UPA government and the current NDA government led by BJP,” she said. \nDinkar, who is contesting from Naraini in Banda, also echoed his leader, “A decade of drought, failure of the state government to provide relief to people, neglect of Bundelkhand by the SP government in UP as well as NDA government at the Centre has disillusioned the people and they are willing to support BSP again. The promise of statehood has rekindled their hope in the BSP.” \nIn 2012, BSP bagged only seven assembly seats, while SP took five, Congress four and BJP three. In 2007, BSP had won 14 seats in the region which played an important role in formation of a majority government in the state after 18 years. \nAnd that is why it is relying on Dalit-Muslim combination to stage a comeback in the region.

Daddu Prasad, a former minister and close aide of BSP founder Kanshi Ram, has floated Bahujan Mukti Party, fielding candidates in a majority of the seats. \nBabu Singh Kushwaha, a former aide of Mayawati, has floated Jan Adhikar Party and urged his community to defeat the BSP. Former BSP zonal coordinator Brij Lal Khabari is contesting on Congress ticket. Senior BSP leader RK Singh Patel, who is popular among the backward castes, joined the BJP before the polls. Rajnarayan Budhauliya, BSP MLA from Mahoba, has also distanced himself from the party activities. \nDespite these developments, Dinkar said the rebels have limited influence and will not be able to dent the BSP votebank. \n“We will win a majority of the seats as people want change and know that the BSP government (2007-12) had launched several development projects,” he said. \nParty general secretary SC Mishra has addressed meetings in the region to woo upper caste voters, particularly Brahmins. \nThe BSP is also working to regain lost ground in neighbouring Fatehpur district. Mayawati, Mishra, Siddiqui, Dinkar and Indrajit Saroj have addressed meetings here. \nIn 2012, the party won three out of six seats in Fatehpur, the SP bagged two seats and one seat went to the BJP.
