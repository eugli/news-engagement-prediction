I was left thinking 'What am I doing on here?'. There were such strange people.\n'I'm not being awful but he looked like a pastry.\n'There were all sorts of odd people on there, with odd interests.\n'Online dating is not something I would normally do. But I was bored and thought it would be a laugh.\n'I'd only been on there an hour or two when I came across this guy.\n'It was his main photo.

I've had that a million times. I've even had it from people I know.\n'But it seems that's dating in this day and age.

But probably the way to my heart is with pizza.\n'If there are any men thinking of getting in touch then pizza is probably the best option - certainly not a d*** pic.'\nAfter taking a screenshot of the mystery man and positioning it next to an image of a croissant that looked strikingly similar, Katie shared it with friends.\nShe wrote on her post: 'IM F*", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T12:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T13:27:47.190+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
