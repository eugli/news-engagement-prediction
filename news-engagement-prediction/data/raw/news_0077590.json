I’ve got options, but do I really want to settle down with a 25-year-old?” she asks the group passionately.\nThis is not well received:\nShe has OPTIONS, okay Anthony? Source: Channel 9 \nOn the other side of the country, twins Michelle and Sharon are really cracking the whip with their dates.\nThat’s not an analogy.\nThe girls take their husbands — Jesse and Nathan — to meet their dad in a paddock, and he makes the guys recreate the Lady and the Tramp pasta thing, except with a piece of hay and a terrifying threat of a whip cracking over them.\nThe dad’s enjoying it too much. Source: Channel 9 \nStrangely enough, the whipping thing really does something to Nathan, so I think it’s safe to say he and Sharon had a saucy night.\n“I want to try new things with Sharon. I want to participate, I want to show her that I do care,” he says.\n“I want to do things with her.”\nLike I said, saucy times later.\nThe girls’ dad is so impressed with Nathan that he could probably get a job as one of his farmhands, but Jesse is simply told he has “good persistence”, which is a real hark back to the many purple ‘participation’ ribbons I received in primary school.\nThe silver lining for Jesse is that he and Michelle are getting along a lot better ever since she forced him to strip down to a G-string and get a fake tan, so as long as he can get a good deal on a 10-visit pack, I reckon they might work out.\nThe other couples aren’t getting a look in here because they’re being quite sweet to each other (read: boring) and as such are being punished because DON’T THEY KNOW THIS IS REALITY TV?\nI’m going to need more drama from you guys. Source: Channel 9 \nBack at MAFS HQ, it appears Andrew can’t stomach the idea of going for round two with the angry Scotsman and has begun to extricate himself from Cheryl’s clutches by moving to another unit right before the weekly dinner party.\nHe admits his feelings toward her have changed, and that there have been a few “alarm bells”.\n“There’s another unit available, so I’m thinking I’ll go stay there for a bit to give each of us some space,” Andrew tells Cheryl.\nCheryl looks very unhappy with this information, as it slowly dawns on her that her marriage track record is starting to make Britney Spears’ look impressive.\nThe face when you realise there are no more spare grooms. Source: Channel 9 \nOnce they arrive at the party, we’re all relieved to discover Anthony has finally stepped up to the plate and started giving his own personal analysis of the other couples’ relationships, just like the experts.\nAfter Andrew reveals to the guys that he and Cheryl are sleeping apart, Anthony delivers his take.\n“I’m not surprised to hear that. From day one, I really questioned that match,” he explains earnestly to the camera.\n“If that’s not a sign a relationship is doomed, I don’t know what is.”\nThe actual relationship psychologists then say some stuff, but let’s go back to the expert:\nThe newest MAFS ‘expert’. Source: Channel 9 \n“Cheryl dug her own grave. She’s there physically, but mentally and emotionally, she’s just not present,” Anthony tells us.\n\nPrivately, Andrew gets fairly emotional talking to Sharon about his disastrous union, telling her she was “spot on” about Cheryl.\n“Things haven’t been good — it’s been horrible,” he tells them.\n“I haven’t felt that low in a number of years ... I haven’t cried for years and I was basically welling up.”\nLet’s just call this one dead in the water and move on to a new topic.\nMeanwhile, Susan is attempting to smooth things over with Michelle and Sharon after calling them bullies for ganging up on Cheryl at the last dinner party, where she re-entered the experiment with Andrew.\nOnly problem is, they didn’t know she’d called them bullies.\nThis new information is taken about as well as that moment Deb found out her new hubby wasn’t Polynesian.\nShazza is unimpressed. Source: Channel 9 \nAnyway, Susan is still confusing everyone with her and Sean’s relationship status.\nThey’re being all cutesy, but didn’t she break up with him last week?! The whole thing reeks of Regina George and Aaron Samuels and I don’t know what to think.\nSo let’s check in with Anthony:\n“I identified early on with Sean and Susan that they’re both wonderful people individually — but together, they don’t work. Sean’s a horseman” he explains.\n“Suze wants someone who will make her a priority. Sean needs a horsewoman, and Suze is not a horsewoman. End of story. Game over.”\nThe original horsewomen.
