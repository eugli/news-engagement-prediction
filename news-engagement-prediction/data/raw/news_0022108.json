Under the final rules package adopted on Jan. 3, the speaker and minority leader no longer have to agree on their respective appointments to the board -- each leader merely has to notify the other before proceeding with their own selections.\n[ Day of chaos as House Republicans back down on ethics charge ] \nThis subtle change -- requiring the two parties to “consult” on new board members instead of “concur” -- is raising concerns among accountability and ethics organizations that believe it could make the OCE more vulnerable to partisanship and in the process, weaken its investigations of misconduct by lawmakers.\n“Ethics in Congress has been done with an intentionally bipartisan approach,” said Meredith McGehee, policy chief at campaign-finance reform group Issue One and a leading expert on congressional ethics. “This is a stark reversal of that approach ... It upsets the fundamental balance that has been key to fighting against the tendency for ethics issues to become partisan.”\nLisa Gilbert, director of Public Citizen’s Congress Watch division, said the appearance of partisanship within the OCE would threaten its credibility. “How people view an ethics body like this matters,” she said.\nGOP aides said Ryan decided to pursue the rules change after Democrats rejected two of their proposed board members, including former congressman Doc Hastings (R-Wash.), who Ryan made Republican chairman of the board last month under the new rules. \nHastings chaired the Ethics Committee in 2005 and 2006, drawing criticism from accountability groups for the panel’s lack of activity. “It’s a national embarassment,” then-executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) Melanie Sloan told the Washington Post one year into his tenure. \nDemocratic aides said Hastings and another candidate disqualified themselves by engaging in hyper-partisan behavior while serving on the Ethics Committee. \nA spokeswoman for Ryan defended the rules change as a necessary move in the face of Democratic defiance to GOP attempts to fill a vacancy on the board. \n“After inexplicable continued obstruction of multiple highly qualified candidates, we were left with no other option to make a rule change in order for the OCE board to operate as intended,” AshLee Strong wrote in an email.\nHouse Democrats created the OCE in 2008 in response to the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal, designing it as an independent, politically neutral body intended to be more aggressive than the House Ethics Committee, which has been criticized for a tendency to protect lawmakers by punishing only the severest cases of rule-breaking.\nThe office’s board must authorize each stage of an OCE investigation, including any decision to refer a probe to the House Ethics Committee for further proceedings. Even if the Ethics Committee does not take further action, the OCE is permitted to release a public report of its findings. \nThe board has six members and two alternates, with each party choosing three members and one alternate. Members are not term-limited, and new members are selected only when a departure creates a vacancy. \nIn the past, the speaker and minority leader would trade lists of candidates and veto picks by the other they considered unacceptable. \nPelosi, who oversaw the creation of the OCE in 2008 as then-speaker of the House, defended the original appointment process through a spokesman.\n“Since the OCE began its deliberations in 2008, this process has achieved its purpose -- there has been little, if any, criticism that OCE was conducting partisan investigations,” deputy chief of staff Drew Hammill wrote in an email. “Leader Pelosi is concerned that the new method chosen by the Republican majority to make these important appointments will lead to the perception that non-partisanship, essential to the mission of the OCE, is no longer important.”\nA spokeswoman for the OCE, Kelly Brewington, declined to comment for this story.\nWatchdog groups said Hastings’s approach as chair will provide the first clue as to whether the OCE is changing.\n“We are hopeful that he will be just as committed to an effective OCE as past members and chairs have been,” said CREW executive director Noah Bookbinder. “We are watching very closely and will be very vocal if we see signs that is not happening.”\nMembers of both parties have criticized and sought to weaken the OCE since its creation.\nOn Jan. 2, House Republicans approved a measure from Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) making major changes to the office, including putting it under the oversight of the Ethics Committee, depriving it of a public spokesperson and preventing it from investigating anonymous tips.\n[ House GOP votes to rein in independent ethics office ] \nThe vote provoked a national backlash -- a tweet from Trump helped prompt the GOP to reverse course -- and Republicans abandoned Goodlatte’s plan the next day. This was celebrated as a victory for ethics enforcement, but accountability groups now view the final result as a mixed blessing.\nSources familiar with prior drafts of the rules package said the change to the OCE board appointments process was included prior to Goodlatte’s broader plan to weaken the office.\n“Thousands of Americans mobilized when they saw what was being done to the Office of Congressional Ethics, and while we were collectively able to reverse some of the key changes, this one was kind of under-the-radar,” said Aaron Scherb, director of legislative affairs for Common Cause.\nThe first-ever head of the OCE, Leo Wise, said it is crucial to preserve the spirit of non-partisanship that has defined the board since its inception.\n“There has to be a sort of wait-and-see if that changes,” he said. “I don’t know how much the rule requiring the two leaders to agree on their appointments fostered that, or if it was the commitment of the board members to act in a bipartisan way. That, to me, was the most important thing.”\nRead more at PowerPost", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:58:31.358+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
