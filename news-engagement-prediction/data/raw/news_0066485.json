And supporting agriculture is the key to both. \n“Besides reducing hunger and boosting nutrition, investing in farmers also provides much needed job opportunities that reduce migration and limit the potential for radicalisation of unemployed youth.” \nFAO collaborates with the World Food Programme, WFP, to ensure vulnerable families, mainly IDPs and host communities receive food assistance, and at the same time agriculture-based livelihood support in the form of provision of seeds, tools and fertiliser. \nThe Oslo Humanitarian Conference targets mobilisation of international funding for the crisis-struck region, where 80 to 90 percent of people rely on farming, fishing and herding for their livelihoods, where now 515, 000 children are suffering from severe acute malnutrition, which poses a dangerous condition which if untreated can lead to permanent damage to a child’s development and even death. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T08:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T03:15:04.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
