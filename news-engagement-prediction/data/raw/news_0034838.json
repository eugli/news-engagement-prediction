Their choice of transport — a white Rolls-Royce belonging to Sir Tom — also seems deliberately ostentatious. And, of course, they arrived and left together. A friend of Priscilla’s told me: ‘The Facebook post is confirmation from her that something is going on. We are all thrilled for her as she has been looking for love for a while now. ‘She doesn’t want a walker, that does not interest her. She wants to find a man and have a proper romance. She is very youthful in looks and attitude. ‘She has had her share of chancers and people who were after the fame or the money. (Two former boyfriends sold stories about their time together after the romances ended.) ‘Tom is perfect because he is none of these things and he is the kind of man who will treat her as a princess, and that is the way she likes it. I think they are made for each other.’ Indeed, there are striking parallels between their lives. Well, for a start, the association is hardly new. They first met in early 1968 — a full 49 years ago — and were firm friends while Elvis was alive. After his death in 1977, they kept in touch, and in 2010, Priscilla was among those cheering in the audience for Sir Tom when he was given a lifetime contribution gong by the Music Industry Trusts at a ceremony in London. Rock n' roll king Elvis Presley with his wife Priscilla Presley and singer Tom Jones, 1967 Only now, ten months after the death of Tom’s wife, Linda, it seems that a spark has finally ignited between them. A friend said: ‘Tom has had a difficult year with Linda’s death and Priscilla has been an amazing support. ‘Tom and Priscilla are courting. There is a spark between them but they are taking it slowly. It really is early days but they get on so well.’ The Welsh singer, a judge on ITV’s The Voice, said: ‘We have been friends for a long time. She’s a lovely lady. We do enjoy our nights out together.’ Priscilla has struggled to find a man to live up to Elvis. Only last year she bemoaned that, having dated crooner Julio Iglesias among others, nobody measured up. ‘[Former President] Bill Clinton has a charisma that commands your attention. It’s the only time other than with Elvis that I’ve felt someone has had that,’ she said. But veteran knicker-magnet Sir Tom, surely, must fit the bill. So what do they actually have in common? ALISON BOSHOFF reports. THE CLOSEST OF TIES TO THE KING Elvis always loved Tom Jones, admiring his voice and his stagecraft. Indeed, out of all the British singers of that era, Jones was perhaps the closest to Elvis. One of their earliest meetings was at the Ilikai Hotel in Hawaii in 1968. Priscilla — who had married Elvis the previous year — astonished Tom by requesting his autograph. She later said that the men were ‘like a couple of schoolboys together’. Elvis later that year took Priscilla to see Tom playing at the Flamingo in Las Vegas — they flew in by private jet. The two men chatted afterwards backstage and Tom’s PR, Chris Hutchins, who was there, said Elvis told Tom how much he loved The Green, Green Grass Of Home and declared: ‘Man, that was terrific. After seeing you, I want to get back up on stage myself.’ Elvis always loved Tom Jones, admiring his voice and his stagecraft. Indeed, out of all the British singers of that era, Jones was perhaps the closest to Elvis Hutchins added: ‘Off stage, Tom and Elvis enjoyed a close friendship, even exchanging rings. ‘Elvis gave Tom a magnificent black sapphire (it later disappeared, along with a young lady, from his hotel bathroom), while Tom reciprocated with a tiger’s-eye ring that Elvis had admired. ‘Another Presley gift was a small Bible, on the flyleaf of which he had written a message. The words certainly looked sincere, but no one was able to decipher his handwriting.’ Elvis was, however, jealous of Tom Jones, often remarking on his tight trousers and saying: ‘He sticks a damn sock down his pants.’ Tom tried to console Elvis over the loss of Priscilla, who had walked out on him in 1972 over his drug use and their virtually sexless post-baby marriage. They didn’t see each other for the last two, sad drug-addled years of Presley’s life. Sir Tom said: ‘I didn’t know Elvis was sick. I thought he was just getting lazy — he was getting heavy and pushed people away from him. The first thing that hit me after he died was I should have gone and seen him.’ Priscilla has repeatedly said that — despite their divorce — she always loved Elvis. She said: ‘We were really good friends. We never stopped loving each other.’ In an interview last year, she said that having Elvis as a former husband probably meant that she was impossible to date: ‘Being with the most gorgeous man ever and not just gorgeous but a good human being too, I realised this could be difficult, so I never threw it in their faces. I hope I was respectful of everyone. ‘But Elvis was absolutely the love of my life, and there’s no sadness about it because I have my memories, and they’re delicious and they’re all mine.’ SETTLING DOWN AS TEENAGERS Tommy Woodward fell in love with Melinda Trenchard when they were both 15, and youngsters in Treforest, South Glamorgan. Linda fell pregnant and married him shortly after her 16th birthday, in March 1957. Their love story was complicated by Sir Tom’s habit of having liaisons with other women, including singer Mary Wilson of The Supremes, and a long affair with a former Miss World, Marjorie Wallace. He was heartbroken when Linda died in April last year and said he thought he might never sing again because of the grief. Elvis famously fell for Priscilla (pictured in 2002) when he first set eyes on her — she was 14 at the time and he was 25 and posted to Germany during national service with the army Elvis famously fell for Priscilla when he first set eyes on her — she was 14 at the time and he was 25 and posted to Germany during national service with the army. They were married when she was 21. Priscilla has always said that, even though she had been living in a wing of Graceland for five years, she was still a virgin on their wedding night. Some Elvis associates have claimed that he didn’t want to go through with the wedding but was put under pressure by her family, with her father threatening to go to the Press about their romance and have him charged under the Mann Act for taking a minor across state lines for sexual purposes. He had a passionate affair with actress Ann-Margret before the wedding and was unfaithful after it too, apparently declining to sleep with his young bride after she fell pregnant, which happened within weeks of the wedding. Priscilla Presley, meanwhile, has endured some disastrous plastic tweaks of her own UNWISE DEVOTION TO PLASTIC SURGERY Sir Tom started with plastic surgery with a nose job back in the Sixties and is widely thought to have had a facelift decades ago as well. He has admitted to having his teeth capped, the ‘heaviness’ taken out of his eyelids and the fat sucked out from underneath his chin — this last procedure spurring him to grow a goatee beard to hide the scarring. He said his plastic surgeon had warned that enough was enough. ‘He advised me against having anything else done. ‘He told me: “You’ve got to be careful with your lower eyes. Your eyes will be bloody popping.” He said I should try to look as natural as I can.’ Priscilla Presley, meanwhile, has endured some disastrous plastic tweaks of her own. She has confirmed that she was among the victims of Daniel Serrano, a bogus doctor who injected his patients with facial fillers made of industrial low-grade silicone similar to that used by mechanics to grease car parts. That was back in 2003. She also appears to have had a facelift, a brow lift and extensive mid-face fillers. FALLOW YEARS AND MONEY TROUBLES Both have struggled at times. Priscilla has run a clothes boutique, launched her own fragrances and bed linen. Her big gamble came after Elvis’s death when she was faced with huge costs for Graceland, and vast taxes. An executor of the will, she opted to open the house to the public rather than sell it, and it paid off spectacularly. Sir Tom also went through wilderness years — no musical release by him charted between 1973 and 1986. His comeback came with A Boy From Nowhere in 1987, followed by the cover of Prince’s Kiss a year later. He’s now worth around £200 million. LAWSUITS AND INFIDELITY Priscilla has been plagued by Lisa Johansen, who has claimed for decades that she is Elvis’s real daughter, Lisa Marie, and was secretly swapped for a decoy child aged nine. She authored a book, I Lisa Marie, to this effect in 1988 and in 2011 launched a civil lawsuit claiming £110 million in damages from the Presley family for defamation and emotional distress. The case was thrown out. In 2015 she resurfaced and said she was thinking of appealing the ruling. Sir Tom’s son, Jonathan, gave an interview in 2013 in which he blamed the lack of a father figure for going off the rails as a young man In 1988, New York model Katherine Berkery had Sir Tom’s child after a three-day fling. He denied paternity but had to make a settlement. Sir Tom’s son, Jonathan, gave an interview in 2013 in which he blamed the lack of a father figure for going off the rails as a young man. He said that he had slept rough, dealt drugs and carried a gun because he had been abandoned by the singer. He claimed that although his mother was sent child support after taking Sir Tom to court, he never received a phone call or birthday card. MAKE MINE A DOUBLE PLEASE… They are divided on food — Sir Tom loves a steak and Priscilla abhors red meat. However both Priscilla and Sir Tom love a tipple. Priscilla said she once had ten pints of Guinness on St Patrick’s Day — holding a race against daughter Lisa Marie. Meanwhile DJ and TV presenter Toby Anstis said they had tequila slammers at midnight on their date in 2012. Sir Tom loves brandy and is a great aficionado. He is also a fan of English pubs. In an interview with Uncut magazine he said: ‘It’s very simple. I like to drink — I’m not a bloody alcoholic but I love good wine and beer and British pubs. ‘But I won’t drink to the point where I hurt my instrument, my voice.’ Sir Tom has also tried his hand as a thespian, starring in the film King Of The Teds in 2012 and also appearing as himself in Tim Burton’s 1996 comedy Mars Attacks! FORAYS ON TO THE BIG SCREEN Priscilla ventured into acting in the Naked Gun films and also starred as Jenna Wade in Dallas. She said that the late Leslie Nielsen helped her: ‘I wasn’t a comedian but he held my hand and told me not to worry.’ Sir Tom has also tried his hand as a thespian, starring in the film King Of The Teds in 2012 and also appearing as himself in Tim Burton’s 1996 comedy Mars Attacks! He said of King Of The Teds: ‘I have always wanted to try to act, but nothing ever came my way, and anyway, singing has always been the most important thing, so I’ve never really gone after a role.’ TWIN MANSIONS IN LA LA LAND Sir Tom has lived in Los Angeles since 1974; Priscilla since 1972, when her marriage ended. Their houses, in Bel Air, are around the corner from each other and surprisingly similar — painted white, mid-century, with lush gardens and large pools. Both have dogs and household staff — neither of them can cook at all. Despite work running the Elvis estate in Memphis, Tennessee, Priscilla stayed in LA, and built an acting career in the late Eighties in Hollywood. Sir Tom talked about returning to the UK in 2009 — but has yet to do so. A PASSION FOR ALL THINGS EQUINE Both have an equestrian streak, although it has to be said neither has been seen on a horse in years. Sir Tom was persuaded to buy a racehorse in 1967 when he picked a horse named Walk On By from stables in Epsom, Surrey. Priscilla is active in animal welfare issues, particularly horse welfare.
