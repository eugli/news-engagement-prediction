While Skip Bayless is among those who believe the veteran QB will be back with the Dallas Cowboys , others expect Romo to continue his career as a starter somewhere else. \nThe same thing that makes Bayless believe Romo will remain a Cowboy — owner Jerry Jones’ loyalty to him — has Colin Cowherd convinced that the team will give Romo a say in which team he plays for next. \nBut while that might be the most player-friendly move possible, guess what? The players say NO WAY. \nCris Carter, Greg Jennings and Minnesota’s Stefon Diggs all agree that teams can’t let players dictate the business. \n\nJennings, the former Packers receiver, saw a similar situation unfold when Brett Favre retired and then unretired, and Green Bay wasn’t willing to give him his job back. The Packers ended up trading him to the Jets for a fourth-round pick. \n“They knew if they allowed Brett to choose where he wanted to go, he would’ve went over to the Vikings RIGHT NOW,” Jennings said on “Speak For Yourself” on Friday. “Why? To get back at this organization.” \nCarter said the Cowboys MUST get something for Romo; preferably a pick. \n“One thing Dallas has gotten right in the last several years is that draft. I would get some type of pick for him,” Carter said. “They have not been wasting picks. They have gotten great value out of their draft picks. If you get a third-rounder, fourth-rounder for him … \n“Last year Teddy (Bridgewater) got hurt. Minnesota is a great example: They gave up a 1 and a 4 for (Sam Bradford). So I ain’t just giving him up. I don’t care how much money I done made with him,” Carter continued. “Players are a commodity, all right? I’m not giving him up until I get something worth value.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T08:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T03:49:09.066+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
