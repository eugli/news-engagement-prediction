Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nLife here in the United States can be strange, can’t it? Transgender restroom access had probably never crossed the minds of most Americans when suddenly the issue became headline news and a national priority. President Obama eventually laid down the law, in 2016 issuing a directive to school districts requiring them to allow students to use whichever restroom and locker room matches their gender identity. \nThe fight for equal rights for transgender people led to a high-profile boycott of North Carolina by businesses, entertainers , and even other cities and states . The issue even had international implications, with North Carolina, Mississippi, and the more rural areas of the United States mentioned by name in an addendum to the U.K.’s travel advisory . \nNow, in 2017, members of the same press are wondering what the Trump administration’s rush is to address the same issue. Here's what Press Secretary Spicer had to say when a reporter asked why the Trump administration was focusing on transgender bathrooms. pic.twitter.com/Zoem9KBogq \n— CBS News (@CBSNews) February 22, 2017 \nWhy the sudden focus on transgender bathrooms? Well, the issue did become kind of a big deal, didn’t it? So where’s the surprise in a new administration trying to roll back the federal government’s role? BREAKING: AP source: Trump administration set to lift federal transgender bathroom guidelines. \n— The Associated Press (@AP) February 22, 2017 \nNew Yorkers — more than 8 million people who apparently share one set of values — can rest easy in the knowledge they’ll always be able to pee freely under Mayor Bill de Blasio’s close watch, no matter who’s president. We affirm the right of every New Yorker to use the bathroom that fits their identity. A new president will not change our values. https://t.co/Ckr1yA5P0P \n— Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) February 22, 2017 Last year, we ensured access to restrooms that align with a person's gender identity. That's not changing. https://t.co/vJHyyD6XvG \n— Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) February 22, 2017 Trending UH-OH! Video surfaces of Bill Maher condoning sex between an adult and a 14-year-old \nIt must be something to be represented by a mayor who articulates your values for you one at a time, as circumstances dictate. De Blasio, for example, let New Yorkers know that he certainly wouldn’t be patronizing the new Chick-fil-A franchise in the city, nor would he urge any other New Yorker to eat there. (Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel also made it perfectly clear in 2012 that “Chick-fil-A values are not Chicago values .”) @NYCMayor Please keep up the resistance, Mayor de Blasio! #NotMyPresident \n— Petty Draper (@PettyDraper) February 22, 2017 \nBy all means, keep up the resistance. @NYCMayor @JMDarhower I thought Trump was leaving this to be a state decision. Am I wrong? \n— Dana Hook (@danahook713) February 22, 2017 @NYCMayor @GeorgeTakei The point was that he was putting it at the state level…Didn't you pay attention? \n— Lindsey Whiteside (@stylistdizzy) February 22, 2017 @NYCMayor @farahbrook Thank POTUS. He wants to leave that decision to the states so you can do what you want with it. \n— Barbara Towle (@BarbaraTowle) February 22, 2017 @NYCMayor That's great. But having this devolve into a local issue is EXACTLY what Sessions & Trump wanted. @GeorgeTakei \n— Sean Smith (@protanope) February 22, 2017 @NYCMayor the president doesn't care where you crap \n— Longisland Howie (@longislandhowie) February 22, 2017 @NYCMayor @NYCMayorsOffice good, I'll just piss in the street then.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:05:24.421+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
