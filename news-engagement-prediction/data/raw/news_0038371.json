A ‘G’ doesn’t have many symmetrical notions,” Brereton said. \n“Sorry, not for mine.” \nBut Fox Footy caller Dwayne Russell, who played 50 VFL games in the blue and white hoops, was in Johnson’s corner. \n“If you’re a 45-year-old, you’re not going to be walking the streets in a footy jumper. But you might wear a T-shirt,” Russell said. \n“I like it, you can wear it around the streets and it’s not too crazy.” \nLive stream EVERY game of the JLT Community Series on FOX SPORTS.
