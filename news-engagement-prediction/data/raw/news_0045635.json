An extra nine minutes of work would account for a 2 per cent increase in productivity, management said, but a pay rise was capped at 1.5 per cent by former employment minister Eric Abetz. Documents said the agreement would have been 'highly contentions, especially if there is not financial compensation'. In a statement provided to Daily Mail Australia, a spokesperson said the ATO is seeking feedback from staff. The documents obtained by the ABC acknowledge many workers, particularly those in senior roles, already work past 4.51pm (stock image) 'We are currently seeking feedback from staff to inform the Enterprise Agreement process and ensure our engagement and communication approaches meet our employee's needs. 'We remain committed to reaching an agreement that provides a good outcome for staff, the ATO, the Government and the Australian taxpayer. This includes ensuring that we can meet our service commitments to the community,' the spokesperson said. The ATO enterprise agreement expired in June 2014, with standard hours from 8.30am to 12.30pm and 1.30 to 4.51pm - or seven hours and 21 minutes of work. 'However, many staff work outside of these hours,' the spokesperson said. National Secretary of the CPSU (Community and Public Service Union) Nadine Flood said the idea ATO staff go home at 4.51pm is 'ludicrous'. 'Our members are working longer hours than ever, including unpaid overtime, because of over 4,000 jobs that have been slashed from the ATO in recent years. Ms Flood said staff were voting against dozens of cuts on the table, and the additional nine minutes of work 'was never the only issue for our members'. 'They were understandably upset at a cut to their hourly pay rate via changing working hours at the same time as they were being told to accept a measly pay offer at that stage of 0.8% a year,' Ms Flood told Daily Mail Australia in a statement.
