The reality is much more sinister, with Nathan preparing the youngster to be sexually exploited in a harrowing story that seeks to raise awareness of the prevalent abuse young people face. \nSpeaking about the scene ahead, Lucy said that it was ‘uncomfortable to film’ but also spoke out about the importance of not shying away from such grim scenes: ‘It’s so important for it to be on, especially at this time, because we’re targeting young viewers watching before watershed – it’s so important to target those people.’ (Picture: ITV) \nLucy added that she hasn’t felt able to watch the scenes herself but Coronation Street has been praised by charities for taking on the difficult subject matter and raising awareness of it to millions of TV viewers. \nIn upcoming scenes, Sarah will grow concerned about her daughter’s boyfriend and will arrange to meet him – but will Nathan manage to talk Sarah round and persuade her that he is no danger to Bethany?
