Andy Silver \nPublished on Jan. 31, 2017 \nJan. 31, 2017 \nBen Barba says he might never play in the NRL again after news broke overnight that he had signed a deal to play rugby union for French powerhouse Toulon. \nThe Sharks' premiership winning fullback was suspended by the NRL after failing a drugs test and has signed a short-term contract with Toulon. \nThe 27-year-old was re-signed by Cronulla, but the contract hasn’t been ratified by the NRL. \nThe situation has led Barba to confirm that he may not return to the 13-man game. \n“I’m not too sure, the NRL haven’t given me much, so it’s probably the first time we’ve talked,” Barba said when approached by TV journos outside his house on Wednesday morning. \n“I’ve gotta look after my kids and my family and they’re my first option. Nothing’s been final yet, so at the moment I’m just listening to the people who take care of me and I’ll go from there. \n“The NRL hasn’t given me much and if it comes to that, I might never play the game again, so I’ll just go from there and listen to the guys who take care of me. \n“We’ll make the decision at the end of the day. \n“They’ve had quite a while to sort my stuff out but it’s taken them three months and nothing’s been sorted out.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T02:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T12:09:45.538+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
