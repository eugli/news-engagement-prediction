Like, her set was amazing, but with Beyoncé that&apos;s expected. If you&apos;re like us and still replaying the performance days later, we have a special treat today: a video of Bey&apos;s performance with the vocals isolated.\nThe result is a beautiful rendition of \"Love Drought\" and \"Sandcastles\" that&apos;s somehow even better than the original set. The stunning vocals are truly breathtaking and might actually make you stop what you&apos;re doing and take a moment. Praise to Beyoncé for always delivering. \n  Slay, Bey. \n\nRelated Adele Praises Beyoncé in Acceptance Speech for Album of the Year: 'My Artist of My Life Is Beyoncé' Solange Co-Signs Frank Ocean's Grammy Diss After Adele Beats Beyoncé Tags: News , Videos , Beyoncé , Grammys", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T20:22:17.652+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
