Townshend denies two counts of perjury and making a false record in relation to lying, but admits negligently performing a duty in relation to causing the camera to collide with the side-stick. The court today heard he deleted photos he took in the cockpit after the incident. Townshend took 28 photos after his co-pilot left the cockpit to make a cup of tea. During the nosedive, Flt Lt Townshend said 'f g hell, s**t, Jesus Christ' and afterwards announced to passengers he 'was not sure' what caused it, Bulford Military Court, Wiltshire, heard. Pictured, how the Voyager fell into the steep nosedive After diverting to an airbase in Turkey, 49 year old Townshend lied when filing a tech-log in which he attributed the cause of the incident to a mechanical fault. He allegedly then lied days later while under oath at a service inquiry, by insisting the incident was a result of a technical error. File picture, an RAF Voyager Opening the trial, Mr Lickley QC said: 'The plane left with 187 military personnel on board, the flight was in essence no different from a passenger flight. 'The pilots operate the plane with a side stick which is similar to a gaming joy stick and they fly in auto-pilot soon after taking off. 'When auto-pilot is engaged the side stick stays in the middle - it can be disengaged when the stick is pushed forward. A reconstruction of the situation shows how the DSLR camera got stuck between the arm rest and the side stick, similar to a gaming joy stick. The plane fell into the nosedive when autopilot was disengaged 'This is exactly what happened during the flight and there was a rapid descent of 4,400ft in a matter of seconds. 'The descent was unannounced so passengers experienced weightlessness, they were thrown to the ceiling and thought they were going to die. 'This all happened while he was alone in the cockpit, the co-pilot managed to get back to his seat and was in fact on the ceiling while trying to gain control with Townshend. The board of seven military personnel was shown a simulation video of a replica camera being wedged into a plane's controls and it was demonstrated how difficult it was to release the camera. Pictured, a reconstruction 'Fortunately they managed to gain control of the plane.' Mr Lickley said checks carried out when they landed in Turkey revealed there were no technical issues with the plane and said Flt Lt Townshend had caused the side stick to move forward. He added 'bored' Flt Lt Townshend, based at RAF Northolt, had taken a series of 'blurred photos' in the minutes before the nosedive suggesting he was practicing long-exposure photography. Townshend denies two counts of perjury and making a false record in relation to lying, but admits negligently performing a duty in relation to causing the camera to collide with the side-stick He said: 'He was seen during the flight taking photos of passing aircraft. Examination of his camera revealed other photos a few minutes before the incident. 'The camera photos were blurred and suggest he was practicing long exposure photography. 'Flt Lt Townshend was not concentrating while flying and was bored. The camera and side stick have damage to them which is consistent with them coming into contact like they did. 'His camera was next to his arm rest which for some reason was not in the right position recommended for pilots. 'The arm rest was pointing downwards and he moved his seat forward, causing it to jam into the side stick and disengage auto-pilot. 'He disputes putting the camera next to him and knowing the camera was in the position it was while jammed. He says it had fallen from a shelf. 'In a tech-log after they landed he said it was a mechanical issue and suggested there was a very serious issue with the aircraft. 'Days later at two service inquiries, while answering questions under oath, he did not tell the truth. He said the reason for the incident was a technical malfunction.' Mr Lickley QC added: 'He chose for some reason to have his arm rest in an odd position, he knew he had put the camera there and he knew it was was there when he moved his seat forward. 'He knew the camera was there during the descent as he was trying to move the side stick to free the camera and he knew he had caused the incident. 'After the incident, 14 personnel were unable to fly back to the UK because of their injuries. The court today heard he deleted photos he took in the cockpit after the incident 'Flt Lt Jones noticed Flt Lt Townshend taking photos on the flight of other aircraft and was shown them. 'Flt Lt Jones said at first there was a rumble and he was thrown into the ceiling and was looking at the sea below him. 'When he asked Flt Lt Townshend what happened he told him 'nothing I was just looking out the window at the stars'.' Flt Lt Jones suffered a cut to the head, a fractured back, a prolapsed disc and nerve damage. The court heard accounts from other passengers. Mr Lickley said: 'Sergeant Ian Burke was pinned up on the ceiling and couldn't move. Sergeant Humphries thought he was going to die and was also pinned on the ceiling. 'Natalie Thornhill, a cabin crew member, was thrown to the ceiling and then thrown to the floor.' Mr Lickley also told the court: 'After the incident a number of images had appeared to go missing and he admitted deleting some. Later he produced a memory stick with the images on.' The board of seven military personnel was shown a simulation video of a replica camera being wedged into a plane's controls and it was demonstrated how difficult it was to release the camera. The trial, expected to last two weeks, continues.
