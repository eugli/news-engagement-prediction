Go f--k yourself, Ryan Gosling.”\nHis co-star, Emma Stone, read a message from a “fan” who said she looked like a “crack w---e in every role she plays.”\nRyan Gosling was subjected to a mean tweet that insulted his good looks during the Oscars Sunday. (ABC) Miles Teller laughed off his insult as someone who “requests ‘Gangam Style’ at a wedding where he doesn’t know the bride or groom.”\nLin-Manuel Miranda was accused of looking like “he’s getting a 1996 NBC sitcom with his haircut,” while Casey Affleck was compared to “the real-life version of Billy Bob Thorton’s character in ‘Sling Blade.’”\nJeff Bridges confirmed a tweet that said he “wears pants a lot less than we think he does,” while Robert DeNiro fought back against some ageism.\nAnother mean tweet compared Tilda Swinton to a dog. (ABC) “Robert DeNiro is too old to be making gangsta movies still...dude needs to start playing grandfather roles,” he read.\n“I am playing grandfather roles. Pretty soon I'll be playing great-grandfather roles. F--k you,” he responded.\nSend a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T06:48:14.835+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
