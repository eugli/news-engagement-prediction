(Photo: Hiverlab) A \nSINGAPORE: Marine biology students and conservation volunteers can look forward to exploring coral reefs at Sisters' Islands Marine Park without actually having to go underwater with a new interactive Virtual Reality (VR) underwater simulation. \nEyes on Habitat: Coral Reefs is a collaboration between local startup Hiverlab, the Info-comm Media Development Authority (IMDA)â€™s PIXEL Labs and DHI Water and Environment. \nIn a joint press release on Wednesday (Feb 15), the developers said the training tool will enhance the training of marine biologists and reef monitoring volunteers as they learn methods in the assessment and monitoring of coral reefs, orientate themselves on monitoring protocols and practice their identification skills in a virtual setting before they embark on actual dives.

This will allow it to cover more coral reefs around the world and create educational programs or workshops based on the data, it explained. \nA standalone prototype of Eyes on Habitat: Coral Reefs will be made available to the public at PIXEL Labs at National Design Centre and Jurong Regional Library in March. - CNA/mz", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T14:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T09:21:04.344+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
