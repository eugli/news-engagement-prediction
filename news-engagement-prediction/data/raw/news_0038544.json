(Kevin Tanaka / Pioneer Press) Gary Larsen Pioneer Press \nThe dismount off of the uneven bars that Maine South junior Jessie Saul does is difficult and rarely done in gymnastics at the high school level. \nIn the parlance of the sport, it's a Higgins to a front flip with a full twist, and it includes a blind landing. And when Saul is twisting and flying through the air, headed for her landing, she's never entirely sure how that landing is going to turn out. \n\"Sometimes I can tell when it's going to be bad, but I can never tell if I'm going to land it or not,\" Saul said. \nThe uneven bars were the final event at the Fremd Sectional on Feb. 7, and Saul's routine was the last one scheduled. After waiting three hours, she performed her routine well and finally arrived at her dismount. \nShe landed at state. \n\"She had one little step on her landing and then her teammates just jumped on her and hugged her,\" Maine South coach Tessa Robinson said. \"It was one of the best dismounts she's done. I'm so proud of her.\" \nSaul scored a 9.250, placed fifth and earned an automatic spot at this weekend's state finals at Palatine. It's an accomplishment that was particularly satisfying for Saul in light of the multiple injuries she has fought through this season. \nSaul's shoulder, wrist and knees have taken a beating over the years. \n\"It's just from the years of working in the sport,\" Saul said. \"It's frustrating. If I hurt too much, I have to stop, but otherwise I'll just ice whatever it is and deal with it.\" \nSaul entered high school as an all-around performer and she tried to compete in the vault and floor exercise at the beginning of this season. Injuries forced her to focus solely on the bars. \n\"I'm not happy that I've had to give up other events, but my knees hurt so bad that I had no choice and I had to stick with just bars. I want to try to do all-around again next year but at this point I don't know.\" \nFor now, she's content to compete in her favorite event starting Friday at the state finals. Prior to her sectional routine, she wasn't sure she'd survive and advance. \n\"During warmups at the sectional, I hadn't landed any and I was really nervous for my dismount. So I was super excited when I landed it,\" she said. \n\"When I did it, my teammates got really happy because it's a blind landing and they know how hard it is to land it.\" \nHawks sophomore Caleigh Pistorius will join Saul at the state finals, and will compete in the all-around, floor, balance beam, and vault. \nRobinson is happy for both of her state qualifiers. \n\"The best reward is when you know the hours they've put in, and they're actually able to do what they've set out to do. For a coach, that's very rewarding,\" Robinson said. \n\"(Saul) is definitely not a whiner or complainer and that's part of the maturity I've seen from her. Despite dealing with those injuries, she has that internal motivation and drive to do the skills that she set out to get. She really pushed through this year.\" \nGary Larsen is a freelance reporter for Pioneer Press. \nTwitter @Pioneer_Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:11:38.199+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
