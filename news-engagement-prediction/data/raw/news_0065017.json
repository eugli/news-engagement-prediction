It’s different from any thing else you do,” she said.\nIn 2017, she’s eyeing off the double mini trampoline title at the World Games, followed by a return to the world champions and hopefully a place on the Olympics teams in 2020 and 2024.\nWard also dedicates what little spare time she has to training up the next generation of gymnastics champions at C2k Fitness and Aquatic Centre Castle Hill, saying her average day consists of “school, training, coaching, dinner and bed”.\n“It’s great giving back to them and seeing them develop their skills and goals,” she said.\nThe other three finalists in the category were Capri Vidler (all rounder), Jayde Oakley (gymnastics) and Liam Christie (trampoline).\nThe Junior Sports Star awards are proudly sponsored by Rebel.\nmedia_camera Olivia Lawne won the Hills Shire Times Young Sporting Spirit Award.\nOlivia Lawne, of Northmead, lives and breathes rugby league, playing and refereeing five times per week.\nShe referees for both the Parramatta district referees and the Catholic rugby league competition and plays for the Hills Bulls all-girls team.\nmedia_camera Olivia Lawne in her referee uniform.\nHer dedication to her sport far beyond just her playing team saw her named the Hills Shire Times 2016 Young Sporting Spirit winner.\nOlivia, who also plays AFL, touch football and OzTag, said her passion to be involved in rugby league after she outgrew the mixed competitions saw her pick up the refereees whistle.\n“I started at nine playing with the boys, but when I could no longer play I started refereeing,” she said.\n“I love being out there on the park and teaching the kids to play safe.\n“(Being a full-time referee) is one of ony dreams and it would make me really proud of myself if I could do that.”\nShe said the greatest challenge she faces on the field is not from the players but from overzealous parents.\n“Sometimes I have felt like giving up, when I cop it from the sidelines, but my parents have always pushed me to not give up,” she said.\nThe finalists in the Young Sporting Spirit category included Kyra Wheatley (skiing), Lachlan Compton (football) and Hunter Hosking (rugby union).\nThe Young Sporting Spirit award was sponsored by Simonds Homes.\nmedia_camera The Hills Little League under-12 team at the Little League Australia Championships in 2016.\nThe Hills Little League under 12s team beat out 17 other strong contenders from across Sydney and the Central Coast to be crowned the 2016 Team Spirit winners.\nmedia_camera Executive officer Louise Riddell and assistant coach Scott Wright accept the Team Spirit Award on behalf of the Hills Little League U12 Team.\nThe representative squad, made up of under-12s players from Quakers Hill, Rouse Hill, Castle Hill and Winston Hills, was selected to play in the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, last year, after being crowned champions at the Australian Little League championships.\nThere they beat sides representing Europe and Africa. They finished in the top 8 in the world.\nReceiving the award, assistant coach Scott Wright said: “This is an awesome thing four our club, considering baseball isn’t as big as other sports here tonight.”\nHe said the trip to Williamsport was an amazing experience for the team and their coaching staff, and was a huge result for Australia baseball as they were only the fourth team ever from Australia to make it to the World Series.\nThe Team Spirit category is proudly sponsored by SportsTG.", "external_links": ["https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-metro/templates/components/header/dist/header.css?m=1484889074h", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/13417aec7f2241f07880d82954dc1a8c?width=1024", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fhills-shire-times%2Fnews-story%2F9abaf781be1fc213bfdd3dd46630086f", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/chronicle/ap/latest/assets/img/news-plus.svg", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f4af872cd25480847aede020e44c3dd9?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a171975d1715a1fe94fe2ad707534ef5?width=650", "http://www.homeimprovementpages.com.au/find_local_tradies", "https://s2.wp.com/_static/??-eJytjcEKAjEMRH/IblgU1z2I31K6wbY0aW1Sl/17C64XD56EgQzDmwysxQR2qS0oELseDeu2nyHKAX4BhsK9WsWBAn9gl1mRFdQj9cozFGBcxeVabDOEWjMoUkm9J+AylcydF/BoF6ywBNHd/+WtZZs2DU6MoK3Ovwe+033qRtfxNM3jfJzOl/gC4F5rlQ==", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/resource/networksales/exoduscampaigns/campaigns.json?t_product=DailyTelegraph&t_template=s3/networksales-loader/index&td_domain=dailytelegraph.com.au&td_pagetype=articlepage_v2&esi=true&td_channel=desktop&td_section=newslocal/hills-shire-times", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=135086289853833&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fhills-shire-times%2Fnews-story%2F9abaf781be1fc213bfdd3dd46630086f&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fhills-shire-times%2Fnews-story%2F9abaf781be1fc213bfdd3dd46630086f", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/606e241a6d091ca974b354db546b153a?width=316", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/02b4ba4dfae2fa4010e13a3c90f3202f?width=316", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/spp-api/v1/template?path=components.header.header&exclude-css=false&exclude-js=false&t_product=DailyTelegraph&t_domain=dailytelegraph.com.au&device-channel=desktop&is_front_page=0&show_idaas_login_placeholder=1&v2=1&is_local_news_section=1", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/d995be510923a47db69323137b35ac6d?width=316", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Hills%2C%20meet%20your%20sport%20star%20winners&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fhills-shire-times%2Fnews-story%2F9abaf781be1fc213bfdd3dd46630086f", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/networksales/loader/latest/assets/js/exodus_loader-client.js"], "published": "2017-02-22T17:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T10:38:46.053+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
