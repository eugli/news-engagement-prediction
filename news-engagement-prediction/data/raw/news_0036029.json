All signs point to splitsville. by Soraya Joseph 1m ago \nSorry team Chyro, but apparently it’s a wrap for Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna – again. According to various sources , that spoke to US Magazine the parents to three-month-old Dream Kardashian have decided to call it quits for another time. \n“Rob thinks it’s the right decision. Chyna has disappeared for days at a time without communicating or providing any updates. This won’t end well. [It’s the same issues] with her yelling and screaming about how his family doesn’t like or support her, and his insecurities.” \nWe guess we shouldn’t be too surprised considering that the two broke up just days before Christmas, following allegations that Chyna put the claws on Rob . It’s just unfortunate because I think fans were really rooting for this reality couple to make it to their wedding day this year. \nWe’re hoping the pair can work it out for the sake of their family. \nRuns in the family! Rob’s baby sister, Kylie Jenner, and Chyna’s ex and baby father, Tyga, have a history of breakups and makeups too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:21:50.390+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
