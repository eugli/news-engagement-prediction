Attacks on the press by Donald Trump [are] more treacherous than Nixon’s.”\nApparently questioning Trump’s mental stability , Bernstein added: “Real news (not fake) is that Donald Trump is trying to make conduct of the press the issue instead of egregious (and unhinged) conduct of POTUS [President of the United States].”\nThe most dangerous 'enemy of the people' is presidential lying--always.

Set up a meeting.”\nThe FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes , @NBCNews , @ABC , @CBS , @CNN ) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017 While the President’s press conference performance was widely mocked, his enemies of the people comment drew comparisons with despots like Stalin and Mao Zedong who had a habit of using the phrase about opponents shortly before they died or “disappeared”.\nTrump is far from being the first US President to attack the media. As far back as 1807 President Thomas Jefferson was complaining: “Nothing can now be believed which is seen in a newspaper. Truth itself becomes suspicious by being put into that polluted vehicle.”\nNixon was also notorious for his hatred of the press . He publicly raged against “distorted” and “hysterical” reporting, and in December 1972, while being pursued by journalists including Bernstein over Watergate, he privately told Henry Kissinger that the press was the “enemy”.\nNo US Presidents before Trump, however, are thought to have gone as far as publicly declaring sections of the media “enemies of the people”, and Bernstein has repeatedly alleged that Trump’s paranoia, attacks on the press and “factless madness” are worse than Nixon’s.\nDonald Trump is more 'ignorant of fact' than Richard Nixon, says Watergate reporter In December, after Trump had been elected but before he took office, Bernstein said: “No president, including Nixon, [is] so ignorant of fact and disdains fact in [the] way Donald Trump does. [He] creates/thrives in truth-free zone.”\nThis factless madness shows @realDonaldTrump to be unhinged. If PresNixon had a Twitter account it would not reflect this much paranoia.\n— Carl Bernstein (@carlbernstein) November 28, 2016 No president, including Nixon, so ignorant of fact and disdains fact in way @realDonaldTrump does.
