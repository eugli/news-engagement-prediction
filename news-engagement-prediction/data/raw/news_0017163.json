Verlinde's new theory of gravity passes first test December 16, 2016 \nA team led by astronomer Margot Brouwer (Leiden Observatory, The Netherlands) has tested the new theory of theoretical physicist Erik Verlinde (University of Amsterdam) for the first time through the lensing effect of gravity. ... Team simulates the expansion of the Universe March 7, 2016 \nThe Universe is constantly expanding. It changes, creating new structures that merge. But how does our Universe evolve? Physicists at the University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland, have developed a new code of numerical simulations ... How Einstein could help unlock the mysteries of space travel August 21, 2015 \nWarp drives might be the stuff of science fiction, but they could be a step closer to reality if we look to Einstein's theory of gravity, according to a University of Sydney researcher. Researcher finds hint of dark energy discussion in letters between Einstein and Schrodinger December 11, 2012 \n(Phys.org)—Alex Harvey, a physics professor at the City University of New York has uploaded a paper to the preprint server arXiv, in which he claims Albert Einstein and Erwin Schrödinger were writing letters back and forth ... New test by deepest galaxy map finds Einstein's theory stands true May 11, 2016 \nBy using Fiber Multi-Object Spectrograph on the Subaru Telescope, an international team led by Japanese researchers has made a 3D map of 3000 galaxies 13 billion light years from Earth (Figure 1).
