Analysts are looking for the company to lose $1.04 per share on revenue of $2.12 billion. Options markets are pricing in an expected move of about 6% in shares following the results, according to data from Bloomberg. Tesla is expected to report after the market close. Earnings \nEarnings season is almost over. \nEarnings are on track to rise about 8% over the prior year . And as for the market’s performance, this has been the best earnings period for stocks since the fourth quarter of 2014 as the S&P 500 is up about 3% during the six-week period that typically covers earnings, according to Bespoke Investment Group . \nBut as Yahoo Finance’s Sam Ro noted on Tuesday , analyst outlooks for stocks are growing increasingly cautious, earnings estimates are coming down, but the stock market seems unperturbed. Additionally, forward 12-month P/E ratios are now at their highest since 2004 , perhaps giving some skeptics pause. Source: FactSet \nBespoke notes that such a positive performance from markets during earnings could lend credence to the idea that recent gains have “borrowed” from future returns. The data, however, simply to not back this up. \nDuring this current bull market, the average return for stocks during earnings season has been 1.85%. The median return in 1.99%. The rest of the quarter outside of typical reporting weeks, stocks are up on average 2.07% with median returns at 2.1%. And during earnings periods where the S&P 500 was up more than 3%, average returns during non-reporting weeks were 1.86% and median returns were 2.1%. \nIn other words, stocks perform almost identically following earnings periods where stocks go up by a lot and during periods when stocks go up just a little. \nWe’ve written recently that markets and politics are clearly moving in different directions . Markets see Trump and the possibilities presented by his administration as reasons to be bullish stocks. Politics see the apparent chaos of the White House as reasons to be nervous about the state of the US government. \nAnd while a lot of lip service is often paid to the idea of “political risk” in investing, well-functioning governments are not a pre-requisite for buying stocks, and the inverse is not an adequate premise for selling. \n— Myles Udland is a writer at Yahoo Finance.
