The runaway Rookie of the Year pick has missed the Sixers' last eight games due to concern over his hyperextended knee. To some, that means he should sit inside and stare at his knee until it heals. \nWell, Embiid doesn't care if dancing on stage at the Meek concert was a good decision in your eyes or not. He only cares about one thing. \n\"I don't think it was a good and I don't think it was a bad decision,\" Embiid said, according to CSN's Jessica Camerato . \"I just thought about having fun ... I saw people said I'm not playing and they expect me not to do that type of stuff. But I mean I'm 22 years old. I'm having fun.\" \nWow, what a bad dude. He wants to have fun and not spend every waking minute thinking about his job. \nEmbiid also said he enjoys reading bad stuff about himself online. So go ahead, it won't phase him. Does Embiid care about what ppl think of him? \"Honestly I don't bc I like reading stuff. I like seeing when ppl say bad stuff about me.\" â€” Jessica Camerato (@JCameratoCSN) February 11, 2017 \nJoel Embiid is real and living his life.
