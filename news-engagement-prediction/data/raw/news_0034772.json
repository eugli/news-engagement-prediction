Not to mention the fact that the soulful songstress looked stunning in an elegant olive green dress by Givenchy. And hitting the headlines this week for the emotional speech that she made in support of Beyonce's album Lemonade, there is more than one reason that we wish this powerhouse singer was our celebrity BFF. But if she was our BFF – where would we work out together? Adele famously works out at London's swankiest gym, the KX gym in Kensington. And Adele is a celebrity that has made an incredible fitness transformation. Tranformation: Adele has made an incredible fitness transformation with Pete Geracimo, who has been a personal trainer for 20 years. Pictured: in 2008 (left) and at this year's Grammy's 'My girl': Geracimo posted this on Instagram after Adele's big night at the Grammy's In an interview with Rolling Stone, she revealed that she wanted to 'get in shape for myself, but not to be a size zero or anything like that'. For her this meant cutting back on sugar, giving up smoking and hitting the gym. 'I'm not, like, skipping to the fucking gym. I don't enjoy it. I do like doing weights', she continued. And she hasn't given up carbs completely explaining that she's not 'that crazy' – we're with you on that one, Adele. Adele worked with her trainer, Pete Geracimo, who has been a personal trainer for over 20 years. Geracimo has not only trained celebs but also a few royals as well. The personal trainer is also a former competitive triathlete and a registered deep tissue and sports massage therapist. When it comes to his philosophy on keeping fit, Geracimo's message is simple. Take time to take care of yourself. 'We all live hectic busy lives. There are not enough hours in the day to get everything done. We need to find that balance where we take care of our responsibilities to our work, family and friends. We also need to make more of a conscious effort to take care of ourselves.' We grilled him a little bit more and he revealed the best keep-fit workouts, his top diet tips plus the mistakes we're all making when we struggle to see our bodies change. The good news? Geracimo explains that you don't have to go to the gym to keep fit. 'The most reliable type of exercise, for me, would be bodyweight training. You do not need to go to the gym to do it, no equipment required and your body weight provides more than enough resistance to get in a great workout. It leaves no room for any excuses not to train. 'A challenging circuit of body squats, lunges, push-ups, pull-ups, dips, chin-ups and plank work will stress every body part and give you a great overall workout.' In an interview with Rolling Stone years ago, Adele revealed that she wanted to 'get in shape for myself, but not to be a size zero or anything like that'. Pictured in 2008 Her weight loss involved cutting back on sugar, giving up smoking and hitting the gym. Pictured: at the Mercury Awards in 2008 (left) and at the Grammy's in 2009 (right) Adele's favorite kind of training is doing weights. Pictured: last year (left) and this year (right) Q. What is your favorite fat-busting exercise and why? 'HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) workouts are the best form of fat burning exercise in my opinion. It takes you out of your comfort zone. Makes you work extremely hard. Sessions are 30 minutes or less. And the key reason is that your fat burning potential continues long after you have finished the session.' Q. What ratio of cardio-weights do you advise? 'It all depends on what your training goal is and what kind of training you respond to. Generally, I would recommend 3-4 weight-training sessions a week and 2-3 cardio sessions a week. Always be as active as possible during your daily routine.' Q. What is your philosophy when it comes to keeping fit? 'You don't have to go to the gym to be fit. The more active we are in our daily activities, the better off we will be. 'Try walking or cycling instead of using the car or bus. Take the stairs instead of the lifts. Go for walks or a run instead of sitting on the sofa watching TV. The secret is to move yourself and not let something or someone move for you.' Q. What would be the one tip you use to keep clients, or yourself, motivated to continue a workout? 'Have a goal that is deeply personal to you that you WANT to achieve. It has to be realistic yet powerful enough to make you go to the gym or go for that run when you really do not want to. Plus in my training sessions, we always have a good laugh and I mix up training styles so there is never a chance for boredom.' Q. What diet do you follow/advise your clients to follow? 'I am a huge follower and advocate of the Sirtfood Diet. (The Sirtfood diet is a plan that promotes eating foods high in the protein sirtuin. This includes foods such as apples, citrus fruits, parsley, capers, blueberries, green tea, soy, strawberries, tumeric, olive oil, red onion, rocket and of course every health-lovers must-have, kale). 'It's not so much a diet but more of an eating lifestyle. It focuses on the positivity of food and not the negative. It is all about inclusion and not deprivation. 'It's easy, accessible and you get to have red wine and dark chocolate! The clients that I have introduced this food plan to have all reaped massive benefits from it.' Q. What is the best diet tip you can give people? 'Understanding which foods work best for your body type and avoid processed foods. Whole and raw foods are better choices. Take the time to make meals from scratch. You will have more control of what you're eating.' A post shared by YouTube: Pete Geracimo (@petegeracimo) on Feb 17, 2017 at 5:35am PST Q. Are there any foods you limit or eat more of? 'I believe everything in moderation and not about depriving myself of anything. I am more partial to eating lots of fish and vegetables but do love a good juicy steak from time to time.' Q. If you have a cheat meal, what is it and how often? 'My view on cheat meals is that it is a treat or reward for working hard. I usually let my clients have a cheat meal every seven days as long as they have earned it. I do not do cheat meals personally because if I really want to eat something unhealthy, I'll make sure that I have worked out hard beforehand so I can indulge without any guilt.' Q. What do most of us get wrong when we aren't seeing results? 'Lack of results is usually due to a poor diet and/or inconsistent training. If you are not fuelling your body properly with the right kinds of food or not keeping to a regular training schedule, results can be hard to come by. To see results, follow my health equation: 80 percent Diet, 10 percent Exercise and 10 percent Rest. Get your diet right, exercise hard and allow your body to recover, you will see amazing results.'
