He was the U.S. ambassador to this country, a Barack Obama appointee who resigned his position following U.S. President Donald Trump’s inauguration. Traditionally ambassadors pink-slip themselves at the start of a new administration, though Trump took the unusual step of outright firing the lot of them upon taking office, with no roster of envoys to assume their place.\nWe have been ambassador-less for nearly a month and yet neighbour-to-neighbour diplomacy has churned on seamlessly, arguably because Prime Minister Justin Trudeau — who’ll be paying a hi-ho visit to the White House Monday — has chosen not to poke the orange bear, remaining frustratingly mute (save for one pro-refugee tweet) as the neophyte administration has rocked and reeled from one self-inflicted crisis to another.\nBut 99.99 per cent of adult Canadians might very well be familiar with Sarah Palin, the lipstick-on-a-pig loose cannon who helped sink Sen. John McCain’s presidential campaign as his vice — and I do mean vice — running mate in the 2008 election. Of all McCain’s strategic missteps , selecting the former Alaska governor as his arm-around for the Republic ticket was widely perceived as his worst decision, a bungle galore.\nPalin is now being bruited about as poised to crash — and I do mean crash — the diplomatic corps, possibly dispatched to Ottawa by Trump as Heyman’s successor. Just rumour as yet, but gaining momentum with no denial from beleaguered press secretary Sean Spicer to stanch the gossip. And just the thing for a novice president who thrives on seeding chaos. Palin is certainly his type: mouthy, inept and unsuitable.\n The Tea Party heroine and her reality-TV brood would certainly put Canada on the map, however, and turn genteel diplomacy on its head. And as a shotgun-toting, moose-hunting, skidoo-driving, “DRILL-BABY-DRILL!” pipeline-boosting, self-declared hockey mom, Palin might actually have a great deal in common with a whole lot of Canadians for whom Ottawa is a foreign country.\nAt least she can find Canada without consulting an atlas. Russia, not so much. “I can see Russia from my house!” was her most memorable phrase. Except Palin never actually said that. It was Tiny Fey, doing her spot-on Palin impression on Saturday Night Live , riffing off a comment the then vice-presidential candidate made in an interview, noting it was possible to see Russia from an Alaskan island. Which is true; the U.S. island sits in the Bering Strait.\nFake news, as Trump would doubtless trumpet of a gerrymandered Quote: from the pre-alternate-fact era.\nWhen covering the 2008 Republican convention, I was rather surprised by Palin’s ability to deliver a speech, for all the VP nominee’s shucks-and-jibe colloquialisms. But of course that just meant reading off a teleprompter, the words written for her. Left to her own unscripted devices Palin was a disaster, as demonstrated in jaw-dropping maladroitness during a bombing TV interview with Katie Couric (couldn’t name a single newspaper or magazine she reads) and ignorance-exposing vice-presidential debate with Joe Biden. Open mouth, insert exploding cigar.\nBy the time the McCain-Palin ticket imploded, Alaskans had already had a bellyful of their governor’s formerly populist appeal. She departed the governor’s mansion trailing plunging favourability ratings, legislative investigations and notorious family dysfunction.\nStill, what are the actual duties of an ambassador and could Palin fulfil them?\nEssentially, the Chief of Mission heads the “country team” of government personnel. The U.S. Embassy & Consulates website lists the gig’s responsibilities. They include:\nSpeaking with one voice on U.S. policy — and ensuring mission staff do likewise — while providing the president and secretary of state “expert guidance and frank counsel.” Does anybody expect an Ambassador Palin to be un -frank?\nCo-operating with the U.S. legislative and judicial branches so that “U.S. foreign policy goals are advanced.” Not sure what Trump’s foreign policy goals with respect to Canada might be beyond advancing his daughter’s droopy clothing and ugly shoes product line, a matter that has recently seized the president’s attention. He’s barely mentioned us except for 1) signing an executive order that could potentially revive the Keystone XL pipeline, albeit renegotiated with terms more favourable to the U.S.; and 2) not a tweet-peep about the Quebec City mosque shooting, though he did phone his condolences to Trudeau whilst Spicer somehow backwards-spun that tragedy into a defence of Trump’s travel ban (since judicially thwarted) against seven Muslim-majority countries when the victims up here were all Muslims and the accused perpetrator purportedly a Trump fan.\n“Taking direct responsibility for the security of the mission.” Palin’s got a gun. (Since 1968, eight U.S. ambassadors have been slain abroad.)\nNot specifically mentioned, although addressed on other diplomatic websites: Organizing state dinners for the president and other American VIPs, and directing the socializing-schmoozing dimension of diplomacy. Oh dear. There was that 2014 birthday party in Anchorage where a whole passel of Palins were involved in a knock-down drag-out brawl. We simply can’t have that at Lornado, the Rockcliffe Park official residence of the U.S. ambassador to Canada.\nI could find no evidence that a host nation has ever rejected a U.S. ambassadorial appointee.\nPalin has dipped her toe into Canada in the past, when it served her needs. Despite demonizing “socialized” health care, she admitted in 2010 that her family had obtained medical treatment under our universal health-care system. “We used to hustle over the border for health care we received in Canada. And I think now, isn’t that ironic?”\nThe irony of an Ambassador Palin is killing me, you betcha.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T04:21:40.652+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
