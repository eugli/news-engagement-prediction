The subpoena, which was issued by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara's office, included \"alleged violations of criminal law by Fox,\" Burstein said. \nOn Wednesday afternoon, a Fox News spokesperson acknowledged that Fox News had been in communication with the U.S. Attorney's office but did not specify if the network was the subject of the investigation. \n\"Neither FOX News nor 21CF has received a subpoena, but we have been in communication with the U.S. Attorney's office for months â€” we have and will continue to cooperate on all inquiries with any interested authorities,\" the spokesperson said. \nOn Wednesday night, however, a source with knowledge of the matter confirmed that Fox News was the subject of the investigation. The settlements in question date back several years, the source said. \nBurstein's remarks were first reported by The New York Daily News and The Hollywood Reporter . He did not respond to requests for further comment. \nBurstein was in court representing former Fox News host Andrea Tantaros on sexual harassment claims she has made against Ailes and Fox News. Burstein did not identify which one of his clients received the subpoena, but said he believed Tantaros would receive one as well. \nIn a court motion filed last August seeking to compel arbitration of Tantaros' claim, Fox News alleged that she \"is not a victim; she is an opportunist.\" \nResponding to Burstein's comments on Wednesday, the Fox News spokesperson noted that Tantaros' case had been moved to arbitration, and accused Burstein of \"histrionics.\" \n\"The court granted Fox News' motion to send Andrea Tantaros' case to arbitration, where it always belonged, and rejected her counsel Judd Burstein's histrionics,\" the spokesperson said. \nFox News has settled sexual harassment complaints by several women, including a reported $20 million settlement with former Fox anchorwoman Gretchen Carlson.
