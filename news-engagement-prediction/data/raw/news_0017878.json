Getty/Chip Somodevilla \nUnder Armour is speaking out about President Donald Trump's travel ban days after the CEO publicly praised the president. \n\"We are against a travel ban and believe that immigration is a source of strength, diversity and innovation for global companies based in America like Under Armour,\" the company said in a statement on its website . \nThe statement came a day after a federal appeals court unanimously ruled against Trump, refusing to reinstate his temporary travel ban against seven Muslim-majority countries. \nUnder Armour CEO Kevin Plank didn't hold back his praise for Trump in an interview with CNBC's \"Fast Money Halftime Report\" on Tuesday. \n\"To have such a pro-business president is something that is a real asset for the country,\" Plank said. \"People can really grab that opportunity.\" \nHe was responding to a question from CNBC anchor Scott Wapner about the CEO's involvement in Trump's Manufacturing Jobs Initiative. \nTrump has gained a reputation as a business-friendly president in his short tenure in the Oval Office. He signed an executive order directing departments and agencies to identify two regulations to repeal for every new regulation proposed, and he met with a council of business leaders, including Plank, to discuss roadblocks to business growth. Trump is also expected to roll back Wall Street regulations , including Dodd-Frank. \n\"He wants to build things. He wants to make bold decisions and be really decisive,\" Plank said in the interview. \nIn response to Plank's statement, a ngry customers called for a boycott of the brand on social media. Athletes with endorsement contract with Under Armour such as Steph Curry and Misty Copeland stated their disagreement with Plank's remarks. \nHere's Under Armour's full statement made Friday: At Under Armour, our culture has always been about optimism, teamwork, and unity. We have engaged with both the prior and the current administrations in advocating on business issues that we believe are in the best interests of our consumers, teammates, and shareholders. Kevin Plank was recently invited at the request of the President of the United States, to join the American Manufacturing Council as part of a distinguished group of business leaders. He joined CEOs from companies such as Dow Chemical, Dell, Ford, GE and Tesla, among others to begin an important dialogue around creating jobs in America. We believe it is important for Under Armour to be a part of that discussion. We have always been committed to developing innovative ways to support and invest in American jobs and manufacturing. For years, Under Armour has had a long-term strategy for domestic manufacturing and we recently launched our first womenâ€™s collection made in our hometown of Baltimore, MD. We are incredibly proud of this important first step in the evolution of creating more jobs at home. We engage in policy, not politics. We believe in advocating for fair trade, an inclusive immigration policy that welcomes the best and the brightest and those seeking opportunity in the great tradition of our country, and tax reform that drives hiring to help create new jobs globally, across America and in Baltimore. We have teammates from different religions, races, nationalities, genders and sexual orientations; different ages, life experiences and opinions. This is the core of our company. At Under Armour, our diversity is our strength, and we will continue to advocate for policies that Protect Our House, our business, our team, and our community. These are not new or revised values. This is what we believe. Under Armour and Kevin Plank are for job creation and American manufacturing capability. We believe building should be focused on much needed education, transportation, technology and urban infrastructure investment. We are against a travel ban and believe that immigration is a source of strength, diversity and innovation for global companies based in America like Under Armour.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T21:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T16:57:18.231+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
