Videos in the Engage section are dedicated to a particular issue, which evokes a strong response in the audience. Popular 360 videos include migrant evictions in France, military drills between Russia and China, and a festive Orthodox service at Russia’s most important cathedral, Christ the Savior, in Moscow. \nThe third category, Feel, is about the pure thrill of seeing life through 360. Clicking on it will let you fly a plane – or sky dive from one – become an urban explorer atop a skyscraper, or ride through a wintry Siberian road on a snowmobile. Of course, traditional categories and search options are still available, and the number of tags has been expanded, meaning that it is easier to search through the hundreds of videos that RT has uploaded to its app since launching it in 2015. Whatever the user decides to do, the interface itself has been remodeled as a panoramic experience, making each menu a circle to be cycled through, and providing screen-filling previews of the clips. \n“Everything was designed so that the user would enjoy a unique experience,” says Chudnovskaya. \nRT was one of the earliest media companies to adopt the 360 format, and plans to continue rapidly expanding its library, as well as the types of stories for which panoramic video is used. RT360 has been downloaded tens of thousands of times, and has been nominated as the Best Video & Photo App at the Shortys. If you have already downloaded it, and like it, you can vote for it here . If you want to try RT360, it is available through both the App Store for iPhones and iPads [LINK: ], and from Google Play for owners of Android devices.
