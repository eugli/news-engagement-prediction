That is definitely a very good rational to halt the immigration process temporarily. I am hoping it is going to be temporary.”\nIssued late Friday afternoon, the president’s order bars people from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the U.S. for three months: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The order also bars any refugees from resettling in the U.S. for four months and it indefinitely blocks Syrian refugees from resettling here.\nTrump’s decree has sparked federal lawsuits and created massive confusion at airports across the nation. Thousands of demonstrators gathered at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport to protest Sunday.\nHomeland Security Secretary John Kelly defended Trump’s order during a news conference Tuesday, saying it is not a “ban on Muslims.”\n“By preventing terrorists from entering our country, we can stop terror attacks from striking the homeland,” he said. “We cannot gamble with American lives. I will not gamble with American lives. These orders are a matter of national security, and it is my sworn responsibility as Secretary of Homeland Security to protect and defend the American people.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T14:03:06.433+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
