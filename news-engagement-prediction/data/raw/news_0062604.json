Very soon we will win full freedom nationwide, and it's going to be with bipartisan support.\" \nShe then turned her attention to her fellow Republicans. \n\"Now I have a message for the bullies: You're sick. And because you're weak, you pick on kids, you pick on women or anyone else you think is vulnerable. Apparently even becoming the attorney general isn't enough to cure some people of their insecurities,\" she said. \nThe last line appeared to be a pointed reference to new attorney general Jeff Sessions. He was reportedly behind this move , one that reversed the Obama-era policies by which public schools had to allow transgender students to use the bathroom of their gender identity. \nFinally, Jenner addressed the president himself.
