ALSO READ: Real Madrid to rival Arsenal for Porto sensation Andre Silva \nArsenal trail Chelsea by nine points and sit in third place, below Tottenham Hotspur on goal difference. \nArsenal will look to shrug off recurring doubts about their mental fortitude and the weight of recent history when they visit runaway Premier League leaders Chelsea on Saturday. \nChelsea dropped points for only the second time in 17 matches in Tuesday's 1-1 draw at Liverpool, but Arsenal could not take advantage as they crashed to a 2-1 home defeat by Watford. \nIt means the gap between the teams remains nine points and should Arsenal fall to defeat again at Stamford Bridge, it is likely to spell yet another premature end to a title challenge.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T03:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:52:36.101+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
