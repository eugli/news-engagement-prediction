Share via Twitter Kate Upton might be on the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue cover for a third year in a row , but that doesn’t mean she's the only star of the 2017 mag. Another model we're loving: Hunter McGrady. She's a stunning, curvy model, and she wears a hand-painted swimsuit in the new issue. The 23-year-old California native is one of SI ’s four Rookies of the Year. “This is a surreal moment for me,” McGrady wrote on Instagram when sharing the news. “Beauty is not a number. It has no limits. I have never felt sexier than I did in this shoot.” What’s especially powerful about McGrady’s story is that she began her career as a straight-size model, before eventually embracing her natural curves. She shared a little bit about her experience transitioning from straight- to plus-size modeling in an interview with SI . She told the mag: “I didn’t work very much as a straight sized model because I am a very hippy person.…When I was about 19, I learned about plus size modeling. It was actually Robyn Lawley, Tara Lynn, and Candice Huffine on the Vogue Italia cover. I saw that and thought, ‘Oh my gosh, these women are so beautiful and they are my size.’ By that time, I had gained some weight and I was about a size 10–12. And that’s what kind of opened my eyes to the plus-size world. I went into Wilhelmina and I got signed and from there, it was like one job after another.” On Instagram, McGrady dedicated her SI photo shoot to women who’ve ever felt insecure due to “rolls, or stretch marks, or cellulite, or acne.\" Check out her whole post below. And if McGrady's giving you life, vote for her to appear in next year's SI swimsuit issue. Because we all need a little more Hunter McGrady in our lives.
