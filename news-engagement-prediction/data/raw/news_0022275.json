There were different views with no consensus reached,\" Lu said. \n\"As for the submission once again by relevant countries to list him in the sanctions list, I would say the conditions are not yet met for the Committee to reach a decision,\" he said. \n\"China has put the request on technical hold, to allow the relevant parties more time to consult with each other. This is also in line with rules of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the rules of the discussion of the committee,\" he said. \nAbout the significance of US pushing for the ban against the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief this time unlike the last year when India pressed for his listing as terrorist, Lu said, \"I would like to point out that the committee has its own set of discussion rules.\" \n\"So, whoever submitted the request we believe all the members of the committee will act in line with regulations of the Security Council and its affiliations,\" he said. \nTo a question whether it will have an impact on China-India relations, he said Beijing and New Delhi \"have exchanged views\" on the issue. \n(With PTI inputs) ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T12:56:22.102+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
