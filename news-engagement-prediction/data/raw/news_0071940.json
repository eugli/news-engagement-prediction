Air Force (Atlantic Hockey) 15. Boston College (Hockey East) 16. Bemidji State (WCHA) \nNo. 1 seeds: Denver, Minnesota Duluth, Harvard, Minnesota No. 2 seeds: Western Michigan, Boston University, Union, UMass-Lowell No. 3 seeds: Providence, Cornell, Penn State, St. Cloud State No. 4 seeds: Ohio State, Air Force, Boston College, Bemidji State \nStep 2: Placing hosts \nNormally, we would be placing the host teams, but for the first time since we started bracketology this season, the University of North Dakota – hosting in Fargo – didn’t make our top 16. They’re currently ranked 14th in the Pairwise, but get bounced by our mock Hockey East champions Boston College, who are currently ranked tied for 17th in the Pairwise. \nStep 3: Placing the teams \nThis was a really difficult bracket to put together this week. Using Boston College as a stand-in for the Hockey East tournament champion makes it trickier to avoid first-round in-conference matchups. On top of that, there is quite a challenge with three western-based top seeds. There are so many different directions that this could go, but I gave a fair amount of consideration to attendance concerns while still trying to do right by the top seeds. NCAA Hockey: Top Five Plays Here is what I came up with:\nWest - Fargo \n1. Denver vs. 16. Bemidji State 8 UMass Lowell vs. 10. Cornell \nRationale: Losing North Dakota from this field opens up a lot of possibilities. I do think the committee would do everything they can to get Minnesota Duluth in this regional, especially if North Dakota is out. That said, attendance is less of a concern at this regional than it would be at others. On top of that, Denver should have a chance to play at its closest available regional (it’s still pretty far) and this is as close as we could adhere to bracket integrity based on the combinations available within the selection committee’s criteria. \nMidwest - Cincinnati \n2. Minnesota Duluth vs. 13. Ohio State 5. Western Michigan vs. 11 Penn State \nRationale: As I mentioned before, I could see the committee putting UMD in Fargo, but this is the next closest regional. With Ohio State being among the four-seeds, I think the committee would prefer to keep them closer to home. Western gets to play in its closest regional and then Penn State should be able to have a decent traveling party for their national tournament debut if they make it. \nEast - Providence \n3 Harvard vs. 14 Air Force 7. Union vs. 9. Providence \nRationale: With the abundance of western-based teams in the bracket, there was more of an emphasis on keeping Providence in Providence despite the Friars not technically being the regional hosts (Brown is). Harvard, meanwhile, fits well in either Manchester or Providence based on distance. Also, flipping UMass-Lowell and Union away from their natural opponents based on seeding allows each to avoid in-conference opponents in the first round. \nNortheast - Manchester \n4 Minnesota vs. 15 Boston College 6 Boston University vs. 12 St. Cloud State \nRationale: Minnesota won’t love having to travel, but since they’re the lowest of the three western-based top seeds, it’s essentially unavoidable, especially with the committee’s preference to avoid in-conference matchups in the first round. That knocks Minnesota out of Cincinnati. Having both Boston teams on this side with a pair of teams out of Minnesota should help the attendance situation in Manchester as well.
