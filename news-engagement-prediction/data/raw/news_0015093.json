What it might or might not be tomorrow, and who issued it, according to Donald Trump, is anyone’s guess. \nWhatever Trump wants us to believe it is or was (hint: it’s Executive Order 13769 and the notice of appeal calls it an “executive order”), it will now go before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to be decided there. Perhaps the court will clarify for us all whether or not it is a ban that is being appealed and let us know who issued it, Trump or Homeland Security. \nIt seems clear that the suggestion by Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) made today that Trump, whom he referred to as our “so-called president,” get a “mental health exam” is well-warranted: Last 24 hrs on Twitter, @realDonaldTrump went on rant about \"death & destruction,\"\"FAKE NEWS,\"&\"evil.\" Should he get mental health exam? \n— Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) February 4, 2017 \nThe White House called Judge Robart’s action an “outrageous order” but what seems to be outrageous is the administration’s inability to keep up with its wave of lies. \nThe case will almost certainly end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. Until then, we can expect a continued series of changing stories out of the White House. Trump, meanwhile, is still ranting about Judge Robart, tweeting that, The judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart. Bad people are very happy! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017 \nIn truth, the bad people are probably as confused as the rest of us. And that includes Donald Trump.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T08:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T03:45:03.760+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
