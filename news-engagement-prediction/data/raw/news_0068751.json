Picture: Timothy Clapin Macarthur Alfie’s HSC year on show in My Year 12 Life Andriana Simos, Macarthur Chronicle Campbelltown February 21, 2017 2:37pm\nBOW Bowing resident Alfie Laga has documented the ups and downs of completing his HSC studies in ABC TV’s unprecedented television experiment My Year 12 Life.\nMr Laga is one of 14 students from across Australia who documented their Year 12 experiences last year and the resulting vlogumentary (video-blog) is packed with emotion, hilarity, heartbreak and suspense.\n“If I had to describe my experience I would say it was full of partying, stress and drama. I am a very social person and my social life was a big part of my Year 12 experience,” Mr Laga said.\n“My 18th birthday was even filmed for the series and that was a big deal for me because I had been planning it for two years.”\nAfter his successful application to be included in the series, Mr Laga said the only thing he had to remember was to film himself because there was no film crew or producers on the ground following him.\n“It wasn’t very hard to remember to film myself. I actually had two main times when I would do it, sitting in my room at night or when I was going out to a party,” he said.\n“Self-documenting my HSC motivated me to study more because I kept thinking about how everyone would see how I studied.”\nHow Mr Laga went in the HSC and what he is doing now will be revealed in the series, which premiered on ABC ME last night.\nYou can also watch the weekly series on the ABC from Sunday at 6.30pm.", "external_links": ["http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/chronicle/ap/latest/assets/img/news-plus.svg", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0429de0c786bf2ccf5d3887d4fc47774?width=1024", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/3b423bf00b5054583a67a9ce27e306ff?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storyheader/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=135086289853833&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fmacarthur%2Fnews-story%2F3b423bf00b5054583a67a9ce27e306ff&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fmacarthur%2Fnews-story%2F3b423bf00b5054583a67a9ce27e306ff", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/3b423bf00b5054583a67a9ce27e306ff?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storybody/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fmacarthur%2Fnews-story%2F3b423bf00b5054583a67a9ce27e306ff", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/resource/networksales/exoduscampaigns/campaigns.json?t_product=DailyTelegraph&t_template=s3/networksales-loader/index&td_domain=dailytelegraph.com.au&td_pagetype=articlepage_v2&esi=true&td_channel=desktop&td_section=newslocal/macarthur", "http://www.homeimprovementpages.com.au/find_local_tradies", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-metro/templates/components/header/dist/header.css?m=1484889074h", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/spp-api/v1/template?path=components.header.header&exclude-css=false&exclude-js=false&t_product=DailyTelegraph&t_domain=dailytelegraph.com.au&device-channel=desktop&is_front_page=0&show_idaas_login_placeholder=1&v2=1&is_local_news_section=1", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Alfie%E2%80%99s%20HSC%20year%20on%20show&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fmacarthur%2Fnews-story%2F3b423bf00b5054583a67a9ce27e306ff", "https://s2.wp.com/_static/??-eJytjcEKAjEMRH/IblgU1z2I31K6wbY0aW1Sl/17C64XD56EgQzDmwysxQR2qS0oELseDeu2nyHKAX4BhsK9WsWBAn9gl1mRFdQj9cozFGBcxeVabDOEWjMoUkm9J+AylcydF/BoF6ywBNHd/+WtZZs2DU6MoK3Ovwe+033qRtfxNM3jfJzOl/gC4F5rlQ==", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/3b423bf00b5054583a67a9ce27e306ff?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storymeta/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/networksales/loader/latest/assets/js/exodus_loader-client.js"], "published": "2017-02-20T19:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:41:19.388+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
