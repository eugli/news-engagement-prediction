It’s unclear where the weirdo Birdman or Being John Malkovich -style magical realism twist will come in, but there pretty much has to be one if those are the two movies The Price Of Admission is being compared to. \nThe project comes from writer/director Peter Glanz, who previously wrote and directed that Jason Bateman-starring Longest Week from 2014. \nSubmit your Newswire tips here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:12:48.588+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
