When the first poster came out showcasing Kunal‚Äôs astonishing transformation, our jaws dropped because the lanky, lean hottie we knew was gone and was replaced by this warrior whose chiseled physique could intimidate you big time. But little did we know, this was the tip of the iceberg. Because the trailer of this movie is finally out and we are speechless. Kunal Kapoor as Chandu Chekavar the rebellious warrior of the 13th century cuts an impressive figure right from the word go. His malevolent smile, his Kalaripayattu skills, the evil glint in his eye, all these characteristics create quite the impression. It‚Äôs hard to believe it‚Äôs the same actor who played the carefree producer Raghuvendra in Dear Zindagi. If Kunal Kapoor impressed us, Jayaraj the director has left us rubbing our eyes in awe. The cinematography is mind blowing and we aren‚Äôt exaggerating. Each frame is a visual treat. The focus on the minute details makes this movie even more enriching. The background score perfectly complements the storyline. It‚Äôs the modern version of macbeth that touches upon elements of greed, anger, guilt, love and war. The film is all set to release in Malayalam on 24th February. The Hindi version will release sometime later in March. After this breathtaking trailer, we won‚Äôt‚Äô be surprised if goes viral in the coming days. \nIn an interview Kunal Kapoor revealed how difficult it was to shoot for the film in Malayalam,‚Äù ‚ÄúIt is a very difficult language. Now that I‚Äôve done a film in Malayalam, I think I can do it in any language. We had a really hard time. It was a big challenge for me.‚Äù The actor further went on to say how it was dream come true for him to work with the award winning filmmaker. Here goes! The trailer of #Veeram Let me know what you think guys üôÇ https://t.co/fBiQGSv302 \n‚Äî kunal kapoor (@kapoorkkunal) February 14, 2017 \nClearly the film has pushed the actor to limits, not known before. We see before us a complex character whose layers will unfold along the journey. Meanwhile, do tell us how did you like the trailer in the comment box below.
