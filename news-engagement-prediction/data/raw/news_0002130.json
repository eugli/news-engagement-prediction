File photo.\nImage by: Esa Alexander The African National Congress in the Western Cape believes Patricia de Lille's resignation as provincial DA leader shows the hold which a white clique around premier Helen Zille has on true power within the party. In a lengthy statement on Monday‚ acting ANC Western Cape chairman Khaya Magaxa said that despite De Lille's success in taking the DA to a new record in capturing two thirds of the Cape Town vote in 2016‚ the fact that she was black and a woman meant she was going to be pushed out by Zille and her acolytes just like former DA parliamentary leader Lindiwe Mazibuko was.\nMagaxa said De Lille was a good mayor but there was a group‚ centred on Zille‚ who was committed not to let the true control of the DA slip from white hands‚ especially not in its Western Cape base.\nDe Lille has resigned as DA Western Cape leader‚ effective Wednesday. She will stay on as Cape Town mayor.\nPatricia de Lille resigns as DA Western Cape leader Western Cape DA deputy leader Bonginkosi Madikizela will act as leader until the next meeting of the DA Western Cape provincial council‚ a large body of public representatives‚ which will elect a new provincial leader. The next provincial council is scheduled to take place at the end of next month.\nDe Lille said in her resignation letter that she wanted to focus on her role as mayor - implementing a transformation plan to \"modernise and reform the government to improve service delivery\".\n- TMG Digital/Parliamentary Team", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?app_id=162804257120529&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.timeslive.co.za%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2F01%2F30%2FANC-says-Zille-clique-pushed-out-De-Lille&send=false&layout=box_count&width=95&show_faces=true&action=recommend&colorscheme=light&font&height=65", "http://twitter.com/share", "http://www.reddit.com/static/button/button3.js", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js"], "published": "2017-01-30T12:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T05:35:40.353+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
