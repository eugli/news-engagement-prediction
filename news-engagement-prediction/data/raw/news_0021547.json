Also sacked were employees of the state-owned television, the appeals court and the elections board.\nTurkey declared a state of emergency following the July 15 coup attempt and embarked on a clampdown on Fethullah Gulen’s movement, purging from government positions more than 100,000 of his followers who are accused of infiltrating the military, police and civil service.\nGulen denies involvement in the coup.\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.
