Ian McCafferty said both events could be counted as \"unusual shocks\" (Photo: PA) \n“At those specific periods, over the very short term, business surveys can give you somewhat misleading signals.” \nSenior Bank officials were repeatedly quizzed by MPs over their failure to foresee the 2007/8 financial crash. \nBut MPC member Gertjan Vlieghe warned “unrealistic expectations” were placed on economics and forecasting models. \nHe gloomily admitted: “We are probably not going to forecast the next financial crisis nor are we going to forecast the next recession. \n“Models are just not that good.” The Bank of England expert compared the impact of Brexit to that of 9/11 (Photo: Getty) \nChief economist Andy Haldane previously described the 2007/8 crash as the Bank’s “Michael Fish” moment. \nThe BBC weatherman’s infamous October 1987 forecast saw him wrongly deny claims a hurricane was going to hit Britain, adding: “But it will be very windy in Spain.” \nHours later, the Great Storm battered the UK, wreaking devastation that claimed 18 lives. \nMr Haldane again admitted the Bank made a “very significant forecasting error,” but added it was important officials learned from mistakes. \nBut committee chairman Andrew Tyrie said: “If there’s one view I have about forecasts is that it’s going to be wrong in economics, and usually very wrong. \n“I’m a deep sceptic about the scope for long-running improvements.” Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie said predictions were \"usually wrong\" (Photo: Rex) \nBank Governor Mark Carney tried to defend the Bank’s predictions over Brexit , insisting: “Do we have a perfect model of the British household? No. \n“We might understand that no forecast as a prediction is perfect, that there’s probabilities around that, but that’s not what people hear, and we need to do a better job of explaining.” \nHe believed the Bank had not received enough credit for its emergency actions in the aftermath of the referendum. \nFollowing the bombshell result, interest rates were slashed to their lowest ever level of 0.25% and £60billion was pumped into the economy. \n“If we hadn’t done that there would have been macro-economic consequences. It was important we did it and we just have to accept we are never going to get any credit for it, but I’m glad we did it,” he said.
