The matchup is almost always a good one, and historically the series hasn't disappointed. \nIn fact, over the last 96 meetings, each team has won 48 times. And each team has scored exactly 7,437 points. So fans on both sides of the fence take this very seriously in the state of North Carolina. \nAhead of Thursday night's game, one North Carolina fan and student, Joe Nail, took the rivalry to a new level by trolling a Blue Devils beloved star. Nail dressed up as Grayson Allen , the polarizing Duke player who has a history of tripping opposing players. So naturally, Nail did the same, tripping random students across the Chapel Hill campus. \nWe know one thing: Nail likely doesn't have a career in acting. But the video, which is very much staged and fake as part of the comedy, is pretty hilarious in itself. He gets a B+ for effort, and a solid A- for the trolling efforts.
