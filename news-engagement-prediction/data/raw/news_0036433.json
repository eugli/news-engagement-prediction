There were a total of 917 hate groups operating in the United States in 2016, an increase from 892 in 2015 and 784 in 2014, the centre said in its annual report. \nThe number of organized anti-government groups, like armed militias, dropped by almost 40 per cent, however, to 623 in 2016 from 998 in 2015. That decline was a consequence of the increasingly mainstream presence of policy ideas and conspiracy theories about Islam and immigrants that originated on the political fringe, researchers said. \nMark Potok, a senior fellow at the centre, said Trump’s election had been “absolutely electrifying to the radical right.” \nThe Trump phenomenon has really unleashed right-wing hate in this country in a way that is difficult to remember \n“Trump has co-opted many of the issues of the radical right, and that has prevented or at least slowed the growth of these groups,” Potok said. He added, “The Trump phenomenon has really unleashed right-wing hate in this country in a way that is difficult to remember.” \nTrump began his presidential campaign with a series of divisive claims, including a June 2015 speech that referred to Mexican immigrants as “rapists” and “criminals.” That December, he proposed fighting terrorism with a Muslim ban, a sharp departure from past presidents, including George W. Bush and Barack Obama, who said jihadi groups did not represent all Muslims. \nBoth as a candidate and as president, Trump has used Twitter and speeches to attack an ever-growing list of targets that number in the hundreds. He has sometimes posted images and messages of support on Twitter that appeared to be anti-Semitic or the work of white nationalists, as have his advisers. \nNevertheless, Trump has consistently rejected the notion that his rhetoric or policy proposals have been divisive or extreme. He has often pointed out that his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, are Orthodox Jews, and when asked about his support among white nationalist groups in an interview with The New York Times last November, he said, “I disavow and condemn” them. \nThe Southern Poverty Law Center said its report tracked only groups that engage in activities in the real world, like passing out leaflets, holding rallies or distributing membership cards. But it warned that such an approach could play down the true reach of extremism because many extremists operate primarily on social media and other online forums. \n“We make a mighty effort to separate out what is really just some guy with a web page or a web forum or tweeting,” Potok said in an interview. “They have to do something that happens in the real world as opposed to online.” Related ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T22:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T05:40:37.366+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
