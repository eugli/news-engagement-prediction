Two of the bullets struck him in his torso.\nThough he was rushed to hospital, Du succumbed to his injuries during surgery the same evening.\nB.C.'s police watchdog, the Independent Investigations Office, spent nearly two years probing the deadly confrontation and forwarded a report to Crown for potential charges last September.\nThough prosecutors have decided not to pursue a case against police, a legal advocacy group said it plans to file a wrongful death lawsuit on behalf of Du's family.\n\"The IIO investigation revealed Tony Du was shot by an officer between 18 – 25 seconds after police arrived,\" Douglas King, a lawyer for Pivot Legal Society , said in a news release.\n“The investigation leaves us with a lot of questions on why officers so quickly resorted to deadly force on a man in mental health crisis, who witnesses reported was not presenting as a threat.”\nThe Criminal Justice Branch’s summary does not indicate how long it took for officers to open fire, but cites dispatch records showing police arrived at the scene just before 4:51 p.m. and called in the shooting just after 4:52.\nPivot noted the report lacks a description or photograph of the 2x4 Du was carrying, information that could be relevant in determining how much of a potential threat he posed.\nIt’s also missing a description of the de-escalation training the officers involved in the incident had received, and whether it was followed the night of the shooting, according to the advocacy group.\nDu's history of mental illness dates back to the late 1980s, and he was diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in 1999.\nHis family said he was never violent, however, despite sometimes being known to yell.\nPivot said the deceased's sister, Lien Chan, was distraught after learning of the Crown's decision not to charge either officer.  \nRelated Stories Man carrying 2x4 fatally shot by Vancouver police", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T04:44:01.537+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
