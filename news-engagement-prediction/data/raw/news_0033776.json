(Photo: WZZM-TV via YouTube) 290 CONNECT 18 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nBANGOR, Mich. — A video showing a group of Bangor teachers and staff making inappropriate comments about students prompted a school secretary to resign. \nThe commentary, heard in a six-minute video posted Monday to YouTube, shows a group of adults sitting around a table at the Bangor Tavern Bar and Grill. Such comments from seven involved Bangor Public Schools faculty include ratings of who they'd have sex with, marry, or kill. \nBangor Police Chief Tommy Simpson told WZZM 13 he watched the video and while he does not see anything in which to issue charges, it's something the school is looking into internally. \nRelated: Morale low among Michigan teachers, survey shows \n\"There was a member of the school staff that filed a complaint because she felt threatened by the video,\" Simpson said. \nThe school board had its regularly scheduled meeting Monday evening with many outraged parents in attendance. A secretary reportedly seen on the video resigned. \nIn addition to the secretary and their resignation, the school attorney said six teachers were involved — two were given written reprimands and four were given verbal reprimands. Many parents at the meeting said they all should resign given the comments. 290 CONNECT 18 COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T23:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T08:38:06.545+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
