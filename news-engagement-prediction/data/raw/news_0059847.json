Most buildings were completely levelled. \nUS forces \nThe regional command said elite forces from the Counter-Terrorism Service were simultaneously attacking the neighbouring Ghazlani military base, where some of them were stationed before IS seized Mosul in June 2014. \nControl of the base and airport would set government forces up to enter Mosul neighbourhoods on the west bank of the Tigris, a month after declaring full control of the east bank. \nAll of the city's bridges across the river have been blown up. \nThe US-led coalition has played a key role in supporting Iraqi forces with air strikes and advisers on the ground, and on Thursday US forces were seen on the front lines. \nThe American troops are not supposed to be doing the actual fighting but in recent weeks have got so close to the front that they have come under attack, coalition spokesman Colonel John Dorrian said. \n\"They have come under fire at different times, they have returned fire at different times, in and around Mosul,\" Dorrian told reporters on Wednesday. \nHe declined to say if there had been any US casualties in the attacks, but an unnamed official later told CNN that several personnel had been evacuated from the battlefield. \nThe latest push to retake Mosul, the second city and the last stronghold of the jihadists in Iraq, was launched on Sunday and involves thousands of security personnel. \nThey started closing in on the airport four days ago. It is unclear how many jihadists are defending the airport but US officials said Monday that only around 2,000 remain in Mosul. \nThere are an estimated 750,000 civilians trapped on the city's west bank, which is a bit smaller than the east side but more densely populated. \nIt is home to the Old City and its narrow streets, which will make for a difficult terrain when Iraqi forces reach it because they will be impassable for some military vehicles. \nLetters from the east \nThe noose has for months now been tightening around Mosul and the living conditions for civilians are fast deteriorating. \nResidents AFP has reached by phone spoke of dwindling food supplies forcing many families to survive on just one meal a day. \nMedical workers say the weakest are beginning to die of the combined effect of malnutrition and the lack of medicines, which IS fighters are keeping for themselves. \nAn army plane late Wednesday dropped thousands of letters written by residents of the retaken east bank to their fellow citizens across the river. \n\"Be patient and help each other... the end of injustice is near,\" read one of them which was signed \"People from the east side.\" \n\"Stay in your homes and cooperate with the security forces. They are your brothers, they came to liberate you,\" read another. \nA smaller than expected proportion of the east side's population fled when Iraqi forces stormed it nearly four months ago but the United Nations is bracing for a bigger exodus from the west. \nIt had said 250,000 people or more could flee their homes on the west bank and has scrambled to set up new displacement camps around the city. \n(AFP) ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T13:32:21.810+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
