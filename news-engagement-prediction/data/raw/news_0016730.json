He found out Saturday. And if he's pissed, he's also trying to rise above the stupidity.\nWhen you align expectations with reality you will never be disappointed. To my family,fans & friends I'm a Hall Of Famer. #FlawedProcess \n— Terrell Owens (@terrellowens) February 4, 2017 That's pretty much the exact right attitude. Owens' credentials are pretty obvious, and the Pro Football Hall of Fame committee has no one to blame but themselves if they don't get why T.O. and his fans are mad.\nUnfortunately I DID NOT MAKE IT again this year. Thanks to ALL my fans & supporters. #FlawedProcess \n— Terrell Owens (@terrellowens) February 4, 2017 But let's recap them to really make this point obvious:\n\nOnly three players in NFL history have more than 130 receiving touchdowns: Jerry Rice (197), Randy Moss (156) and Terrell Owens (152). Owens is fifth in total touchdowns scored, behind Rice, Moss, Emmitt Smith and LaDanian Tomlinson. He is second - to Rice, of course - with 15,934 receiving yards. He had eight 10-touchdown seasons and nine 1,000-yard seasons. He was a first-team All-Pro five times. His nine-catch, 122-yard performance while injured in Super Bowl XXXIX is a truly legendary showing that would have made him Super Bowl MVP had the Eagles pulled it out vs. the Patriots. Unlike Monk and Reed, all those all-time ranks have held up from the time he retired until the time he became eligible for the Hall. His combination of size and strength had a massive impact on the position. Look at Julio Jones or Dez Bryant or DeAndre Hopkins. They're the new T.O. prototypes. This is an NFL legend. Yes, he was a hothead and sometimes total jerk and distraction. Yes, he had some crucial drops at times late in his career. But on the field, he was a fiery competitor and had one of the five greatest wide receiving careers in NFL history.\nTerrell Owens is a Hall of Famer, with or without the Hall of Fame's help.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T05:37:02.781+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
