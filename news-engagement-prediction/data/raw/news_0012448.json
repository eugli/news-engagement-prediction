Mr Shiner previously admitted nine allegations of acting without integrity and recklessly, including that he made ‘unsolicited direct approaches’ to potential clients. He was ordered to pay interim costs of £250,000, with a full means test to determine further costs to follow. The case is thought to be one of the most expensive ever brought by the SRA, with costs expected to exceed the £475,000 reached before the trial. The review comes as a photograph emerged of Mr Shiner and Labour’s Baroness Chakrabarti, the shadow attorney general. Shiner was made a honourary Doctor of Law from Kent University in 2012. The case is thought to be one of the most expensive ever brought by the SRA, with costs expected to exceed the £475,000 reached before the trial The pair were said to have collaborated extensively while she was director at Liberty as they worked together on cases of Iraq abuse allegations. In 2008, Shami Chakrabarti lavished praised on Mr Shiner, saying: ‘His relentless work on behalf of the families of British soldiers and Iraqi civilians demonstrates the even-handedness of human rights.’ In 2011, at the conclusion of the Baha Mousa inquiry, Shami said that Shiner and his team of lawyers had ‘brought honour to their profession’. In 2015, she suggested Shiner was the victim of a witch hunt by the government. She said: ‘I know the dangers of governments threatening human rights lawyers for their work. It happens in dark parts of the world and is not good for the rule of law.’ Her office did not respond for comment last night.
