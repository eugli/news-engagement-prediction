It’s a long overdue tribute,” co-curator Ian Dejardin said. \nThe exhibition covers her long career as an artist, from student works in 1905 to her last self portraits before her death in 1961, and brings many pictures out of decades in storage, and others that have always been in private collections. \n“Of the many works we have borrowed from the Tate, only the one of Studland beach is regularly on the walls, the rest were all in storage,” Dejardin said. “We had lots of the family in for an early look – there are scores of them, all ravishingly beautiful, it’s in the genes – and they were running from wall to wall remarking on how many of the pictures they’d never seen before.” On the Steps of Santa Maria Salute, Venice, painted in 1948, has been in a private collection.

One shows the artist Duncan Grant reflected in a mirror: he said he realised she was in love with him when he noticed her staring at him as he shaved. They shared Charleston farmhouse in East Sussex happily for decades, and had a child even though he was gay – and a former lover of Bell’s brother Adrian. Their child, Angelica, went on to marry David Garnett, another of Grant’s lovers. Detail from a portrait of Virginia Woolf.

Dejardin has worked there for 19 years and has run it for 12. He is leaving on Friday, with his partner Eric Pearson who designed the exhibition, and takes over in April as director of the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Ontario. \n“It’s a week of very mixed emotions,” he said. “I’m looking forward very much to the new job, but it will be almost unbearable to leave here – Dulwich is an extraordinary place.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T18:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T13:21:28.703+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
