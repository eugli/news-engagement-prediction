He walked up to the stage and sat with PAS leaders behind the invited speakers, who included Kelantan PAS information chief and exco member Datuk Nasurudin Daud and Keterah PAS chief Wan Ismail Wan Jusoh. \nWhile Nasurudin was speaking, a member of the audience appeared at the side of the stage and challenged Husam to debate on the issue. \nThe situation quickly turned into a shouting match between Parti Amanah Negara supporters of Husam and those from PAS. \nIt was only after security guards urged Husam to leave the stage that the situation returned to normal. \nHusam, who saw the tense situation, left the stage but mingled with the crowd while Nasurudin continued with his attacks. \nNasurudin claimed that Husam had sent him three letters to debate on the baiáh issue since November last year but nothing materialised. \nHusam then proceeded to a shop in front of Kota Darul Naim (the state government complex) where he explained that he was invited to the ceramah by a member of the organising committee. \n\"I was invited to the ceramah and that was why I came in the hope of debating with Nasurudin. \n\"When I sat on the stage I asked PAS Youth information chief Nazman Che Ibrahim if I could be given five minutes to speak. \n\"Nazman told me that Nasurudin denied my request,\" he told the Amanah supporters. \nHusam said Kelantan PAS, especially Nasurudin, was unprofessional and should apologise to him for using his name in a contentious issue. \nThe baiáh issue is a matter of debate among PAS leaders who had defected. \nThey had sworn that if they were to violate the oath, it will result in divorce from their wives. \nKuala Krai MP Dr Mohd Hatta Ramli and Tumpat MP Datuk Kamaruddin Jaafar, who won on PAS tickets in the last general election, are said to have violated the oath, which was introduced by the late Kelantan Mentri Besar Datuk Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat in 2004 to stop defections.
