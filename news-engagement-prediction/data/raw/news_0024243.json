If you don’t break another one, I’m losing money,” he joked to De Niro. \nColbert wanted to give his guest something special to remember his appearance on the show, and De Niro ended up with a backpack filled with a Big Apple clock, a t-shirt with a kitten scaling the Empire State Building, a fake Oscar statuette, and a stack of Trump candy. \nHe did, however, politely decline the Trump magnet, bobblehead, and condom. “Give it your wife, put it on the refrigerator,” Colbert joked of the magnet. “They’re really nice. They’ll stick to anything, even if they’re not metal.” \nAs the pair surveyed the fake Statue of Liberty figurines and “I Love NYC” t-shirts, the host said, “For a real New Yorker like you, this is like being home, everywhere you look. Let’s everyone know that you’re from New York.” \nWatch their shopping excursion in the clip above.
