Mixed opinions. 2/19/2017, 7:52:15 PM The slick interplay between Neymar, Suarez and Messi for the goal was not ever-present in the first half, though. Leganes caused Barca a number of problems and Ter Stegen saved on three occasions from Nabil El Zhar. The German goalkeeper initially stayed big after El Zhar had beaten the offside trap before keeping out the Moroccan's effort from the rebound, and then Ter Stegen showed excellent reflexes in keeping out his deflected effort from the edge of the box. The other moment of true quality in the first half involved a neat exchange between Suarez and Messi, and the Argentinian would have made it 2-0 with his left-footed flick had it not been for Iago Herrerin's fine stop. Squawka provided the key stats from the first 45 minutes: Squawka Football @Squawka Barcelona 1-0 Leganes HT: Shots: 8-4 Pass accuracy: 88%-77% Chances created: 5-2 Possession: 64%-36% Messi's early goal the difference. https://t.co/qbBKqzwxGW 2/19/2017, 8:35:54 PM In the 55th minute Barca were again exposed at the back as a long ball from the Leganes goalkeeper was headed on to put Miguel Angel Guerrero through on goal. Ter Stegen made another fine stop to keep Barca ahead but it was a further warning sign for Barcelona. Rafinha almost put the game to bed as he skipped through on goal in the 68th minute but his effort was cleared off the line. And three minutes later Leganes tied the game up at 1-1, Lopez side-footing home from the edge of the box after a cut-back from Darwin Machis. After all his earlier heroics Ter Stegen should arguably have done better to keep out a shot that was very close to him, per Sport : SPORT English @Sport_EN After so many good saves, Ter Stegen messes up for the goal, Unai Lopez's low strike should have been kept out 2/19/2017, 9:15:00 PM The hosts pushed forward in search of a winner but Leganes barely gave up a chance. That was until Martin Mantovani fouled Neymar in the box in the final minute and Messi blasted a brilliant finish into the top corner to snatch victory.
