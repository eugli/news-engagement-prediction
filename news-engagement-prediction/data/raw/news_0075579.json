'She has no reason why she can't move on with her life as well. Some days she sends 50 to 60 messages. She keeps changing her number but I know it's her because she sends me pictures of herself. 'I've never seen or been to visit her at all since the court case, I can't understand why she's so obsessed with me. I'm worried what Jade will do, she obviously knows where I live.' At Blackburn Magistrates Court, Morgan, from Accrington, who is now engaged to another man wept as she pleaded guilty to harassment. Magistrates said the case was so serious it had to be sent to crown court for sentencing.

Prepare yourself, you could quite easily be sent to prison for this. I don't know how you feel but saying that anybody committed rape - I'm a man and I find that disgusting.

You need to keep away from electronic devices, that might be the best thing.'
