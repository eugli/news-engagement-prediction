Those who consumed the most protein had the most muscle mass and stronger quadriceps, the muscle in front of the thigh were stronger. The most protein was the equivalent of 4oz (126g) for a 70kg - while the lowest was around 2oz (52g). Scientists have discovered that so long as someone eats legumes, nuts and kale, they will have the same strength as a meat-eater But the results didn't change based on someone's dietary pattern, the study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found. THE BENEFITS OF GOING VEGAN Going vegan could keep prostate cancer away. Men who avoided eating all animal products, including eggs and dairy, were a third less likely than others to develop the disease, scientists found. In the first study of its kind, researchers from Loma Linda University in California tracked the health of more than 26,000 men aged 30-plus for five years. Someone getting a large amount of protein from red meat was benefiting as much as a person eating just legumes. Study author Dr Kelsey Mangano said: 'High protein diets do benefit most individuals. 'It can be beneficial to maintaining muscle mass and strength – particularly as we age.' This comes after a study in August suggested swapping meat and eggs for lentils and nuts could add years to someone's life. Scientists found eating less protein from animal sources such as red meat and dairy products, and increasing plant proteins from cereals, beans and soya, substantially reduced death rates. Mortality from heart disease fell 12 per cent, and deaths from all causes fell by 10 per cent, Massachusetts General Hospital researchers found.
