It ain't going to go down like that, it'd be too easy.\" \nOf course, Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal teamed up to beat Iverson and the 76ers in the little man's only NBA Finals appearance in 2001. \nIt's a longshot, but maybe one day Iverson will have that chance, as he's among the former players who will compete in the Big3 3-on-3 league that is being developed by Ice Cube, Iverson and others. \nChauncey Billups, Charles Oakley and Kenyon Martin are among the players who have committed to play. \nOur money is on Oak's team, especially if he's asking.
