We’ll be honest, Amendola looks like a natural. And Culpo’s reaction and caption suggest she’s impressed, which counts for something given that she’s made a living off doing modeling work. A post shared by Olivia Culpo (@oliviaculpo) on Feb 13, 2017 at 10:13pm PST \nTMZ Sports also posted footage from the event, which reportedly was attended by celebrities such as Madonna, Kylie Jenner, Sofia Richie, Paris Hilton and Nicky Hilton.
