North point guard Tariq Deere was more focused than usual Tuesday against Lemont. \nHe had good reason. \nThe Meteors had a chance to claim the South Suburban Blue title outright with a victory. A loss would have meant sharing the title with Hillcrest. \nDeere and his teammates weren't in the sharing mood. T.F. North used a 16-4 spurt in the second quarter to take control and ease to a 67-44 SSC Blue win in Calumet City. \nThe win put the icing on an undefeated conference championship for the Meteors (22-3, 13-0). It also snapped Hillcrest's streak of 28 seasons of at least sharing a conference title. \nDeere, a 5-foot-11 senior, led the way with 16 points. Terrell Porter followed 13 and Michael Williams had 10. \n\"It feels really good not to share it,\" Deere said. \"We wanted to be greedy. It's an exciting moment. We're undisputed conference champions.\" \nDespite returning most of its nucleus from a 23-7 team last season, the Meteors flew under the radar until the midway point of the season. \nDeere confirmed the lack of attention provided motivation. \n\"It made us even hungrier,\" Deere said. \"Sometimes it's good to fly under the radar. We're not surprised at what we've accomplished.\" \nThe Meteors allowed a 15-4 lead shrink to 21-15 after Lemont's P.J. Pipes knocked down a pair of free throws at 6:37 of the second quarter. \nFrom that point, T.F. North dominated. The Meteors used full-court pressure defense to ignite their transition game, which led to easy layups. \nLemont (14-11, 9-3) never had an answer and trailed 39-21 at halftime. Pipes led the Indians with 18 points and Paul O'Leary added eight. \nWhile T.F. North has had a tendency this season to take its foot off the gas in the early stages of the third quarter, that wouldn't be the case against the Indians. \nMeteors coach Tim Blankston made sure of it during a halftime pep talk. \n\"We played at Rantoul on Saturday and we had a bad third quarter,\" Blankson said. \"We were lackadaisical. I made sure to remind them of that (Tuesday).\" \nThe message resonated with the Meteors, who started the third quarter with a 10-2 spurt to take a commanding 49-23 lead as Porter contributed six points of the 10 points. \n\"Coach told us not to mess around,\" Porter said. \"We had to keep up the pressure and stay focused.\" \nThat's the same message Blankston has for his team in the Class 4A playoffs. The fourth-seeded Meteors open up play in the T.F. South Regional at 6 p.m. Tuesday against the winner of Hubbard and Bremen. \n\"It's great to get one of the goals we set for the season,\" Blankston said. \"But we want to keep this momentum going into the playoffs.\" \nLincoln-Way West 56, Plainfield South 12 : Joey Schloegel (145) and Jake Dudeck (220) contributed first-period pins for West (18-3) in the 3A team sectional at Oak Forest. \nLockport 40, Edwardsville 19: Trevell Timmons (160) won by technical fall and Payton Fernandes (195) added a pin for Lockport (26-0) in the 3A Mahomet-Seymour Team Sectional. \nLemont 43, Brother Rice 33 : Kyle Schickel (106) and Egan Berta (145) recorded pins for Lemont (18-4) in the 2A Oak Forest Team Sectional. \nOak Forest 55, De La Salle 15 : Brandon Muselman (126) won by major decision and Eric Brenner (195) via fall for host Oak Forest (15-5) in the 2A team sectional. \nBoys Basketball \nChicago Christian 77, Clifton Central 21 : Jack Ellison scored 18 points for Chicago Christian (20-7) in the 2A Momence Regional semifinals. \nAndrew 53, Bradley-Bourbonnais 49 (2 OT): Mike DeHaan had 12 points and 12 rebounds and Joey Krutilla added 12 points, seven rebounds and six assists for Andrew (13-12, 5-6 SWSC Red). \nBrother Rice 74, Tinley Park 50 : Mike Shepski had 19 points and Jack O'Connor added 17 for Rice (23-5). \nDe La Salle 92, Urban Prep-Bronzeville 57 : Will Norman's 18 points lifted De La Salle (16-10). \nLincoln-Way East 61, Lockport 50 : Sam Shafer scored 17 points and Dorian Aluyi added 16 for East (19-10, 6-4 SWSC Blue). \nSt. Rita 85, East Chicago (Ind.) 77: Jordan Matthews finished with a team-high 15 points for St. Rita (16-10). \nT.F.
