These are the swankiest. There’ll be 81 apartments (with set-ups of one, two and three bedrooms) and rents ranging from $1,855 to $3,830 per month.\nThe picture below shows a two-bedroom, two-bathroom unit.

The entire three-building complex was built so you couldn’t see the game.\nBut that’s mostly fine for the 55 folks who’ve already signed leases, as a significant number are either season-ticket holders or connected to the Braves or a retail business in The Battery, said Oates.\nFor the season-ticket holders, he said, these apartments are $3,800 crash pads for after the game.\nCheck an exclusive sneak-peek from inside 1,272 square feet of premium living at The Battery less than 1,000 feet from the Braves' new SunTrust Park.

Rents there are between $1,225 and $4,305 a month and include one-, two- and three-bedroom units.\nIf Residences is for the seasoned executive, think about Parkside as being for their kid who joined the family business.\nOn the tour, workers were installing the baseball-evoking turf by the empty pool. There’ll be an entertainment center featuring walls lined with Braves swag where residents can play billiards and shuffleboard.\nFlats, with options of one and two bedrooms, is set to open in June. The monthly cost ranges from $1,355 to $3,030 for its 239 apartments.\nThat wasn’t a part of the tour since they’re not fully constructed.\nBut considering the Flats was originally a pond and none of The Battery had sidewalks a week ago, nothing looked too bad.\nAnd of all the units, 65 percent have one bedroom, 34 percent have two bedrooms and 1 percent have three bedrooms. That 1 percent equates to eight or nine apartments.\nSunTrust Park: The rules of open-container tailgating at Braves games\nIn all, between 800 and 1,000 residents could call The Battery home.\nAll who call The Battery home will use key fobs to get into their buildings.\nAs for where all those residents park, there are garages throughout The Battery.\nBattery dwellers will be allotted one parking spot per bedroom.\nStrife explained that an app named “ Sequr ” will make it so residents won’t need to fumble for any button to open the parking gate.
