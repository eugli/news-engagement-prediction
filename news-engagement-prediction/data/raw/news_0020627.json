Image caption The bridge was rebuilt at a cost of £5m \nA barge was wedged against Elland bridge with several others left stranded on the towpath when high water receded. \nGraham Ramsden, of the Canal and River Trust, said: \"It's been the most complicated bridge build I've worked on. \n\"We have put it back pretty much as it looked before, but stronger and flood resilient. Every bit of stone in the new bridge came from the old bridge.\" \nCold weather and ice at the end of January had slightly delayed work and the reopening. \nIt comes just days after the reopening of Tadcaster bridge in North Yorkshire. \nA third bridge, in Linton, West Yorkshire, has yet to reopen.
