An image showing a President Trump welcome mat on the floor of a Starbucks was doctored. 0 CLAIM A photograph shows a Starbucks with an welcome mat featuring a picture of President Trump on its floor. FALSE FALSE   the @TrumpThe45th Twitter account shared an image purportedly showing an outlet of the giant Starbucks coffee chain that was using an image of President Trump as their welcome mat: \nThis image was doctored, as the original does not feature a floor mat with President Donald Trump’s picture on it. \nThe original photograph was taken in March 2014 (nearly three years before Trump became president) at a Starbucks in California’s Disneyland Resort: \nExecutives with Starbucks open the doors for the first time at the newest coffee shop in Downtown Disney at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim. \nThe @TrumpThe45th Twitter account, a shill account for the Departed Media fake news site, has previously peddled false stories about President Obama’s raising the retirement age, Vladimir Putin criticizing President Obama, and President Obama’s saying that even terrorists have rights.
