TERESA RAMSEY/FAIRFAX NZ \nRe-cycle members, from left: Garry Leather, Eric Comer, Arthur Harsant and Chris Dale with some of the bikes left after the most recent burglary this week. \nRe-cycle group member Arthur Harsant said when members meet each week to up-cycle the bikes, they are met with another theft and more destruction of property. \nREAD MORE: Karangahake school community devastated by theft of 22 Chromebooks \nThieves have repeatedly cut through the wire fence, ransacked the property and on one occasion lit a fire. \nIn the past few weeks, more than 50 up-cycled bikes have been taken, along with bike parts such as chains, wheels and cables that were needed to fix more bikes. \n\"Literally pretty much all the bikes we've done up ready to give away in the last few weeks,\" he said. \n\"We thought because of what we were doing, we'd be immune to this.\" \nMember Chris Dale said the last lot of stolen bikes were bound for children at Moanataiari School in Thames. Ad Feedback \n\"The sad part is that if they want something, they just have to ask, we'll even help them build it,\" he said. \nThe Re-cycle group was the legacy of late Thames Lawyer Bruce Oliver, who died shortly after setting it up. \n\"He wanted to see everybody on a bike,\" Dale said. \nBikes are donated from members of the public and Smart Environmental Refuse Transfer Stations around the Coromandel Peninsula. \nOnce up-cycled, the bikes are donated to children whose parents can't afford to buy them a bike. \nSome are donated to adults who have just found employment but need transport to get to work. \nGroup members also spend time in schools helping children rebuild bikes, which they get to take home. \n\"The people that are stealing from here are actually stealing from the neediest section of the community, they are not stealing from the rich.\" \nDale said attempts to report the thefts to police had been futile. \nHowever, group members were \"down but not out\", with plans to re-establish the group at the more secure Seagull Centre sometime this year. \nMembers of the public can still donate old bikes to the group: Chris Dale, phone 07 868 2690, or Arthur Harsant, phone 07 868 9257. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:04:11.298+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
