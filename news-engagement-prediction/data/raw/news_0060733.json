However, as Mayor Gary McCullough said Friday, if the owner of the building obtained a permit, there would be nothing he could do to stop the sign from being posted. \n\" If it meets the requirements, we can't regulate what it says, \" McCullough told the Dahlonega Nugget . \" The US Supreme Court says so. \" \nREAD MORE: Feds sue company that fired black man complaining of intimidation from KKK hood-wearing coworkers \nThe City of Dahlonega says the sign falls under free speech laws, but they hope that “ those who wish to tarnish our community's reputation will ultimately rethink their tactics, ” the city said in a statement updated Wednesday. \nOn Wednesday, the mayor confirmed one of Green-Garrett’s employees had picked up an application to put the sign back up on the building. On Friday, the Historic Preservation Commission of Dahlonega posted a picture of the permit application and said that the new sign would be a 70- by 18-inch wooden sign that could become a “ permanent fixture ” of the building if the city council allows the permit to go through. \nAfter the sign was placed, the local church organized a “ unity march ” to protest the sign, with hundreds of angry locals gathering in front of the building on Thursday and Friday.

They also say that the Board of Zoning Appeals denied Green-Garrett’s plans for construction on another building in town, saying she had not completed the applications. \nCity Council member Mitch Ridley says that he hopes the city will do anything they can to block the sign from going back up. \n“ I think it’s irresponsible of a business owner to damage the Dahlonega brand for their selfish personal gains. It is totally a lack of community spirit, ” Ridley said. “ I don’t think it will go up legally again. ” \nIn a Facebook post by Neva Garrett, who claims to be the owner’s sister-in-law, she says the sign is justified and that it was posted in response to her family being attacked in the past. \n“ Indeed, some of the people posting ‘no hate in my town’ and carrying ‘no hate’ signs have bullied, or tolerated the bullying, of my own family... as well as others in this town, ” Neva said. “ Keep casting stones, hypocrites. ” Infamous #KKK 'imperial wizard' found dead in suspicious circumstances, autopsy ordered https://t.co/RbNxNgQlws", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T09:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:12:31.313+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
