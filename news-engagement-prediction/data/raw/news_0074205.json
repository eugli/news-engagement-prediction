Spicer is the man, incidentally, whom the Washington Post noted, called open media access “what makes a democracy a democracy versus a dictatorship.” \nWelcome to the new dictatorship. \nTrump’s CPAC speech made it very clear that the greatest-ever lover of the First Amendment thinks it’s a one-way street, saying, “(The media) say that we can’t criticize their dishonest coverage because of the First Amendment.” \nNo, what we say is that the President can’t falsely claim that we report fake news when our stories are vetted as necessary by lawyers to assure accuracy. \nLawmakers, Constitution experts protest Trump's attack on press \nMeantime, Fox News was allowed into the briefing even though Sean Hannity had retweeted a fake news story just last week, labeling true American hero Sen. John McCain a “globalist war criminal” — for which he later apologized. \nThe President also raged that reporters shouldn’t be allowed to use anonymous sources even though HE does. In fact, hours earlier the White House held another briefing, insisting the press not name the speakers! \nIt’s Kafka without the laughs — just the cockroach. \nThe press may keep a source’s identity anonymous for his/her safety. But why does the White House do it? \nTrump demands no more anonymous 'sources' after W.H. briefing \nThe real question, however, is whether the recurring Friday Trump hate-fests are a smokescreen to keep us from focusing on the, ahem, real news. \nSuch as? Trump slipping this in at CPAC: “You wouldn’t have said it a year ago and nobody would have liked it and now everybody likes it. You may have to have some boots on the ground ’til you get rid of the cancer.” Not everybody liked it. He was booed. \nThere is a cancer all right, but it’s the one invading the American body politic. And that’s not fake news. Muhammad Ali’s son, 44-year old Muhammad Ali Jr., was detained at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood airport after returning from a trip to Jamaica with his family. (Ken Carl/Coleman-Rayner/Ken Carl/Coleman-Rayner) POLICY’S NOT THE GREATEST \nIt’s not a Muslim ban, it’s a ban on, well, Muslims. As part of President Trump’s extreme vetting policy on Muslims,or make that Muslim countries, Muhammad Ali’s son, 44-year old Muhammad Ali Jr., was detained at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood airport earlier this month and held after returning from a trip to Jamaica with his family. \nMuhammad Ali’s son detained at Fort Lauderdale airport: report \nWhen did Jamaica become one of the Muslim nations Trump wants banned from entering the U.S.? When did American citizens get restrained from entering the U.S. — especially when those held are U.S. citizens holding U.S. passports? \nGranted, the Fort Lauderdale airport had been the site of a horrific shooting spree by a mad veteran, which ended in the deaths of five people a month earlier, but this man, the son of an American icon, was traveling with his mother, Khalila Muhammad. The mother, and former wife of the champ, was allowed to enter after showing the agents a photo of her with her ex-husband. \nIf immigration officials allow a policy of holding American residents returning from trips to the Caribbean, maybe they should start with Trump’s son, Eric. He traveled at great security expense to the taxpayers last month to the Cap Cana resort in the Dominican Republic, which the Trump Organization had once invested in but which failed miserably. TRULY ILLEGAL ‘ALIENS’ \nUndocumented Earthlings: What if we get to the newly discovered Trappist-1 planets to escape Trump’s immigration policies only to find out the new planets won’t let us in because we’re undocumented aliens? ... \nBull Market: Bloomberg News declared “Trump Is on the Verge of His Own Bull Market.” As in what? The bulls--- market? Hell, Trump cornered that market decades ago ... Amal Clooney, wife of George, has it all. (THOMAS SAMSON/AFP/Getty Images) \nKim Jong Ooops: Speaking of the dictator of North Korea, turns out that Kim Jong Un’s half-brother, Kim Jong Nam, was assassinated by two women. The assassins rubbed him out by rubbing the most toxic chemical on the face of the earth onto the face of the brother. North Korean’s leader, un-beloved leader Kim Jong Un is suspected as a culprit behind the deadly poisoning. Who does he think he is? Putin? ... \nAll Amal All The Time: Amal Clooney must have been Mother Teresa in a former life to get that face, that body, that brain and George Clooney AND his babies in this one. TRUMP’S LOGIC IS COMPLETELY FULL OF LEAKS. SAD! \nIn October, candidate Trump told supporters, “I love WikiLeaks!” Why? Because they had leaked hacked emails of Hillary Clinton’s former campaign chair John Podesta and the DNC. Will Meryl Streep's Oscars dress distract from celebs who show up nearly naked? (Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images for Women In Film) \nPresident Trump, however, hates leakers, tweeting (of course), “Classified information is being given to the media that could have devastating effect on U.S. ... STOP NOW.” Wait, he’s asking us to stop the leakers? Love you today, hate you tomorrow. Now we know how his pack of ex-wives and girlfriends felt. AND THE WINNER IS... \nThe Oscars! Another Sunday, another awards show in which some of the richest working people on the planet get dressed up in free bazillion-bucks outfits to show they are one with the rest of us working stiffs. \nThey will laud one another as though they survived war instead of just playing war victims, they will give annoying political speeches, unfunny scripted dialogue and idiotic unscripted vulgarity. Some will only be remembered for their outfits. This year, Meryl Streep’s dress (Did she get paid to wear it? Seriously?) may take the spotlight off whichever desperate celebrity shows up nearly naked in a million-dollar outfit. It’s the emperor’s new clothes on a global scale. \nOscar is a phony mess, and I wouldn’t miss it for the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T08:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T03:41:05.208+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
