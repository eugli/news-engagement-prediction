However, following a wave of terror across the country this week, franchise owners are reluctant to host the final in the Punjab capital. \nTeam owners will meet Sethi on Monday to decide the venue for the final, The Express Tribune has learnt. \nArmy will support hosting of PSL final in Lahore, says Bajwa \n“A meeting will be on Monday to decide if the final will be held in Lahore or somewhere else,” a source privy to the matter told The Express Tribune . “Franchise owners will voice their concerns in the meeting.” \n“It is not a good idea to hold the final in Lahore, especially after the terror attacks last week,” one of the franchise owners told this scribe. “God forbid if even there is one death during the match or a blast near the venue…not only Pakistan cricket will suffer, it can also put the future of PSL in danger.” \nAnother owner said Pakistanis should wait for one more year to welcome PSL back home. “It is a huge risk in taking these players back to Pakistan.” \nMeanwhile, it is also believed that some international players may not get the NOC from their respective boards to play the fixture in Lahore.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T00:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T19:44:16.044+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
