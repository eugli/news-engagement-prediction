She further said that Mayawati has been the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh before and people are aware of the administration condition of that time. “Such reactions show their frustration as they are aware of the fact that they are going to lose the election,” Lekhi said.\nYou May Also Like To Watch This:\nShe, however, said that personal attacks are a part of politics, but should not take place as per the norms. Earlier, launching a scathing attack at Amit Shah over his ‘Kasab’ remark, Mayawati said, “there is no bigger ‘Kasab’ (terrorist) than the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president.” The former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh further said Amit Shah’s Kasab statement shows the cheapness of the saffron party.\nThe BJP president drew flak from the opposition for devising ‘KASAB’ as an acronym for describing Congress , Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP).”In the last fifteen years, the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) governments have ruined Uttar Pradesh. The two were enough for destruction, however, a third one has also arrived. The population of UP must get rid of this KASAB, and by this I mean – ‘Ka’ for Congress, ‘S’ for SP and ‘B’ for…,” Shah said while addressing a rally in Chauri Chaura. While he didn’t clearly mention the BSP, there was no denial from his side when the audience shouted ‘BSP’.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T14:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T08:41:52.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
