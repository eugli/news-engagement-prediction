See below for some of their helpful advice and make sure you drive safely. Driving in snow and ice Wear comfortable, dry shoes for driving. Cumbersome, snow-covered boots will slip on the pedals. Pull away in second gear, easing your foot off the clutch gently to avoid wheel-spin. Up hill - avoid having to stop part way up by waiting until it is clear of other cars or by leaving plenty of room to the car in front. Keep a constant speed, choosing the most suitable gear well in advance to avoid having to change down on the hill. Down hill - reduce your speed before the hill, use a low gear and try to avoid using the brakes. Leave as much room as possible between you and the car in front. If you have to use brakes then apply them gently. \nTop tip: If you get stuck, straighten the steering and clear the snow from the wheels. \nPut a sack or old rug in front of the driving wheels to give the tyres some grip. \nOnce on the move again, try not to stop until you reach firmer ground. Before you go... Get up at least 10 minutes early to give you time to prepare the car. Don't drive off with a tiny hole cleared in the windscreen. Clear all windows using a scraper and de-icer. Use a cigarette lighter to warm a key for a frozen lock. Don't breathe on the lock, as the moisture will condense and freeze. Plan routes to favour major roads which are more likely to have been cleared and gritted. Put safety before punctuality when the bad weather closes in. Allow extra time for winter journeys but be prepared for the inevitability of being late for work due to unexpected delay. Check your tyres (Photo: Flickr/Julie Blaustein) We recommend at least 3mm of tread for winter motoring, and certainly no less than 2mm. DON'T reduce tyre pressures to get more grip - it doesn't work and reduces stability. Consider changing to winter or all season tyres - these have a higher silica content in the tread which prevents it hardening at lower temperatures, and therefore gives better grip in cold, wet conditions. What's wrong with your car? A continuous squealing noise as soon as the engine is started is a sign the water pump is frozen - it's the fan belt slipping on the pulley. The cylinder block could be frozen too. What do you do? Stop the engine immediately and allow it to thaw out. This may take several days unless the car can be moved to a heated garage. If the car begins to overheat a few miles from home it's likely that the radiator has frozen, preventing coolant from circulating. Stop straight away to avoid serious damage and allow the radiator to thaw. Conserve your power Use antifreeze Antifreeze costs only a few pounds, but a frozen and cracked engine block will cost hundreds to repair. Most modern cars use long-life antifreeze. It's important to use the right type and avoid mixing different types. Check the handbook or ask a dealer for advice. Some types of antifreeze may need to be changed after only two years. Check the manufacturer's service schedule. You need a 50-50 mix of antifreeze and water in the cooling system for winter. This gives maximum protection down to -34 degrees centigrade and without it severe engine damage costing hundreds of pounds can occur. Make sure your vision isn't impaired (Photo: Flickr/Sigfrid Lundberg) Keep the windscreen and other windows clear â€“ if your vision is obscured through dirt, snow or even sticker-infested car windows you could face a hefty fine. Clear snow from the roof as well as from windows as this can fall onto the windscreen obscuring your view. It can be a hazard to other road users as well. Dazzle from a low winter sun can be a particular problem. Use air conditioning for faster demisting and to reduce condensation on cold windows. Check windscreen wipers and replace if necessary. Make sure that wipers are switched off in the park position when leaving the car, when there's risk of freezing. If you don't and the blades freeze to the screen, you could damage the blades or wiper motor when you turn the ignition on. Top up Windscreen washer fluid and treat with a suitable additive to reduce the chance of freezing. Don't use ordinary engine antifreeze as it will damage paintwork.
