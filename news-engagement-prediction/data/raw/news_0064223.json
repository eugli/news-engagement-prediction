Leona Chin and Maxman.tv pull a prank on unaware driving instructors on the first day of their job By: FE Online | Published: February 24, 2017 11:33 AM Leona Chin is a Malaysian Motorsport Professional and currently works with Kuraz Motorsports \nDrifting is fun! But, if the car is in the hands of a novice driver, it can prove to be lethal. And if the driver is a learner who is being instructed in a driving school who 'mistakably' drifts their car, the instructors will scream their lungs out. A driving school in Malaysia wanted to prank their instructors on the first day of their job and roped in Maxman.tv. \nThe prank involves a number of cameras and a closed environment where Leona Chin, a Malaysian motorsport professional currently with Kuraz Motorsports poses as a 'nerdy driver' in her brother's car which has learner-plates. After repeated stalls, dodgy gear shifts and wrong turns, the instructors lose all hope of approving Leona for a license to drive. Little did they know that the girl posing as a first-time driver has one of the best motorsport skills. She asks for one more try in a closed parking lot where she does hard acceleration and the instructors think Leona is losing control. The car in question is her own motorsport car which has been stripped away off the motorsport livery and the rear spoiler. To keep the prank legit, a large teddy bear is also placed in the rear seat. \nVideo: Fast & Furious Nerd Shocks Instructors (Video Courtesy: Maxman.tv Youtube Channel) \nThis is not the first time Leona and Maxman.tv have been asked to pull a prank on unaware people. In another prank, Mitsubishi asked them to showcase the actual capabilities of their Triton Phantom pickup truck where Leona poses as a sales girl on her first day of the job. A test drive vehicle with off-road modifications is available to which the unaware potential customers ask if they can take a test drive. Mid-way Leona asks to swap and once she's in the driver's seat, the prank is on! \nLeona's relationship with fast cars started at the age of 16 when she met a couple of car enthusiasts. According to her official website, Leona credits them 'as the catalysts for the current passion.' Whoever thought girls can't drive must watch this video.
