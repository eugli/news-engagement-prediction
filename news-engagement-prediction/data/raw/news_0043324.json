The Coast Guard has set up security zones around Palm Beach to restrict boat traffic on the Intracoastal Waterway near Mar-A-Lago and on the ocean side of the Barrier Island. That zone when into effect around 2 p.m. Friday and will remain in effect until about midnight on Tuesday. \nAs local and federal efforts are underway to protect the president, the Washington Post reported about the high cost of guarding the president and his family as well as the cost of their living arrangements across the country and their trips across the globe. They reported that this effort is straining the Secret Service and security officials and might wind up costing hundreds of millions of dollars during President Trump’s 4-year-term. \nEarlier, the president stopped into South Carolina in his first visit to the state since he won the GOP primary last year. \nPresident Trump touted his jobs promises while in North Charleston where Boeing is rolled out the first 787-10 Dreamliner aircraft from its assembly line. The trip came just two days after Boeing workers voted overwhelmingly to turn back an effort to unionize the plant. \nOn Saturday, Trump will hold a rally in the AeroMod International Hangar at the Orlando-Melbourne International Airport as part of a tour to thank his supporters for electing him. The hanger is familiar ground for the president. Last September, an estimated crowd of 8,500 packed it, with thousands more outside, to hear Trump speak during a campaign stop. \nLast weekend, Trump hosted Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Mar-a-Lago. The two played a round of golf and “had great conversations on a wide range of subjects,” according to a White House statement. \n(TM and © Copyright 2017 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
