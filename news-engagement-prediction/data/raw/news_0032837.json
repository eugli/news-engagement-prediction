Gang members, drug dealers & others are being removed! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 12, 2017 \nBut other Twitter users jumped on Trump's attention to Cuban: Really, @realDonaldTrump , do you wake up each morning and think \"Who is talking trash about me? I'll get 'em!\" — David G. McAfee (@DavidGMcAfee) February 12, 2017 . @realDonaldTrump So you have time to tweet about Mark Cuban but still have yet to comment on the Quebec mosque shooting? — Aléx Young​ (@AlexYoung) February 12, 2017 . @realDonaldTrump I know it's hard for you, but a President doesn't obsess over which billionaire TV personality insulted him that day. — Bess Kalb (@bessbell) February 12, 2017 @realDonaldTrump narcissism at its finest — Mikaela Hoover (@mikaelahoover) February 12, 2017 What's funny here is Trump, who is only wealthy because of his dad, is bashing @mcuban who is entirely self-made. Sad! — Jordan Uhl (@JordanUhl) February 12, 2017 \nCuban has said he feels free to be critical of the president because he doesn’t run a public company anymore, but it can be tough for executives who do. \n“You want to make nice with the president because you’re a public company and you have shareholders, and it’s hard to balance doing the right financial thing versus doing what they think is the right thing, whatever your political beliefs are,” Cuban told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram . “It’s not an easy position to be in.” \nTrump started battling with Nordstrom last week when the company decided to drop Ivanka Trump’s product line, citing poor sales. My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom . She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 \nTJ Maxx and Marshall’s followed suit and told employees to dispose of signs and stop displays for Ivanka Trump products. Neiman Marcus got rid of her accessories and jewelry line on its website. \nAt a White House press conference last Wednesday , spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump was responding to an “attack on his daughter.” \n“For people to take out their concern about his actions or executive orders on members of his family, he has every right to stand up for his family and applaud their business activities, their success,” Spicer said. \nSome Twitter users were concerned the president was using his position unethically. Surely @realDonaldTrump using his office to make money for his family is an ethics violation https://t.co/kvWP0C4OQ7 — Tim Guinee (@TimGuinee) February 8, 2017 . @JosephBoctor @realDonaldTrump He's upset that they dropped his daughter's line.Trivia: this man holds the codes to 4000 nuclear bombs. — AlyaaGad AfhamTVأفهم (@AlyaaGad) February 9, 2017 View Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T21:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T18:02:27.131+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
