But dogged police work looks to have gotten cops a huge step closer to justice in the murder of the Queens jogger. \nA month ago, the case seemed to have gone cold. That’s when Lt. John Russo — a 19-year NYPD veteran who, like the Vetranos, lives in Howard Beach — recalled a young man he’d found lurking around parked cars near Spring Creek Park, the scene of the crime, months before the killing. Another witness had seen the same man the next day, in an incident for which he had received a summons. \nConnecting the dots, Russo pored through records and found the name of the man who would become the suspect, Chanel Lewis.
