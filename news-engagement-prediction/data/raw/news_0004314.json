(Photo: Robert Deutsch/USA TODAY; Gilbert Carrasquillo/FilmMagic) \nBig Sean pulled out all the stops for his latest album. \nOn I Decided. , out now, the Bounce Back rapper recruited Eminem, Migos, Jeremih, The-Dream, and girlfriend Jhené Aiko for a slew of titillating, tempestuous bangers. But one collaboration he left on the cutting-room floor was a new song with Coldplay's Chris Martin, which Sean is \"kind of mad\" about axing. Q&A: Big Sean on new album, 'romance' with Jhené Aiko \n\"The only reason that song didn't make the album was I didn't know if it fit,\" Sean told USA TODAY. \"I wanted to keep it real cohesive; I didn't want to have stuff that kind of didn't fit or kind of did fit. The song is super-tight. So I'm going to put that out soon or it might be for the next album — I don't know. \n\"But Chris Martin is definitely one of the features that we had done for the album but I didn't put it on there, only because the album is so precise. I'm sure that'll be coming soon.\" \nSean wouldn't be the only young artist that Martin has teamed up with recently. Last fall, EDM duo The Chainsmokers teased a still-unreleased collaboration with the Hymn for the Weekend singer, which could potentially pop up on their upcoming debut album .
