Learn the Symptoms to Help You Decide Whether You Need Treatment By Laurel Delp, Special to Lifescript Published February 08, 2017 W ondering if your blue moods could be more than a temporary case of “the sads”? Find out if you have a serious disorder that requires treatment… Have you been a little sad lately? In a bad mood? Feeling “blah”? An occasional, temporary case of the blues is a normal response to life’s ups and downs. But if these feelings persist, it could be depression – a serious condition that calls for professional treatment. “Depression isn’t [when you think] I feel sad right now or I’m having a sad week ,” says Gail Saltz, MD, clinical associate psychiatry professor at the New York Presbyterian Hospital Weill-Cornell School of Medicine. “It’s having a constellation of symptoms for more than two weeks.” Of the approximately 20 million U.S. adults who suffer from bouts of major depression, 70% are women, according to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). The good news: Most people who receive appropriate help – therapy, antidepressant medication, or often both – see their symptoms improve, the NIMH says. If you think you could be depressed, the first step is to consult a physician to rule out other causes. Then quickly seek professional treatment . The longer you wait, the more serious your depression can become, the NIMH warns. What are the most common signs of depression? These telltale symptoms set the condition apart from an everyday blue mood: W ondering if your blue moods could be more than a temporary case of “the sads”? Find out if you have a serious disorder that requires treatment… 1. You can’t sleep – or you sleep way too much - lately. Have you been suffering from insomnia? Sleep disturbance is one of the major signs of depression. It could be that you have trouble falling asleep at night. But waking in the early morning hours, and finding it impossible to fall back to sleep, is also common among people who are depressed. “Once someone has trouble maintaining sleep, they often decline further into depression,” says Kirsten Thompson, MD, staff associate psychiatrist at the University of California-Los Angeles. Although less common, oversleeping is another depression symptom. “Sleep can go up or down,” says Sarah Vinson, MD, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Morehouse School of Medicine and Emory University in Atlanta. “[For people with depression], sleep can be a way to escape.” W ondering if your blue moods could be more than a temporary case of “the sads”? Find out if you have a serious disorder that requires treatment… Whether you’re lying awake at night or sleeping as much as 12 to 14 hours per day, you’re probably waking up exhausted, Dr. Vinson adds. 2. You’ve noticed a change in appetite or weight. Have you been overeating, or drawn to unhealthy foods because you think they’ll make you feel better? Or, conversely, have you lost interest in food altogether? Both can be symptoms of depression, especially if they represent a change in your usual eating patterns. Weight loss or weight gain may also be signs. “Appetite, like sleep, can go either way,” Dr. Vinson says. W ondering if your blue moods could be more than a temporary case of “the sads”? Find out if you have a serious disorder that requires treatment… 3. You feel hopeless. A persistent low mood – and feelings of hopelessness, guilt, worthlessness or self-loathing – are common warning signals of depression, Dr. Saltz says. “That’s especially true if you have these feelings for a good chunk of the day,” she notes. Women are especially vulnerable to sinking moods. That’s because hormone fluctuations can affect brain chemistry, according to the NIMH. Hormonal changes during PMS, perimenopause or after a pregnancy can sometimes lead to a fleeting case of the blues or serious depression, the institute says.

You used to love spinning class, meeting friends for after-work drinks, or taking the kids to the park. Now, none of it brings you joy. The inability to feel pleasure, known as anhedonia, is a common sign of depression. So is a loss of libido, Dr. Saltz says. While everyone experiences an off night or two, women with depression often have no desire for intimacy. Lack of pleasure makes it harder to motivate yourself to participate in activities or spend time with others, Dr. Vinson adds. That, in turn, can result in further isolation and loneliness – which may worsen depression, she says. W ondering if your blue moods could be more than a temporary case of “the sads”? Find out if you have a serious disorder that requires treatment… 5. You have no energy. You’re frequently exhausted. You may even feel as though you’re moving underwater. “Lethargy is quite common in depression,” Dr. Thompson says. “It translates into people not wanting to get out of bed, go out or do anything.“ That can lead to a deeper problem. “Major depression can [cause] what’s called psychomotor retardation, which means you actually move and think more slowly,” Dr. Saltz says. And that makes getting through the day even more difficult, Dr. Vinson adds. W ondering if your blue moods could be more than a temporary case of “the sads”? Find out if you have a serious disorder that requires treatment… 6. You can’t concentrate. You’re easily distracted, and sometimes even blank out on the names of people close to you. “People who’ve been really stressed for a long period of time start to have memory difficulties and problems thinking,” Dr. Saltz says. In fact, some women with depression may think they’ve developed ADHD. Older women can be mistakenly diagnosed with dementia, Dr. Vinson says. But when depression is successfully treated, memory and the ability to focus return, she adds. W ondering if your blue moods could be more than a temporary case of “the sads”? Find out if you have a serious disorder that requires treatment… 7. You have trouble accomplishing simple tasks. Exhaustion, lethargy, lack of motivation and a poor diet can all conspire against you when you’re depressed. Suddenly, everyday endeavors seem impossible to complete. “With depression, there can be a decline in functioning,” Dr. Vinson says. “What used to be easy can now seem like a herculean task.” Someone with mild depression may make a mountain out of a molehill, imagining that a job is bigger and more difficult than it really is. You may find yourself procrastinating more often. But if you have major depression, you may be too paralyzed even to try to accomplish those tasks, Dr. Vinson says.

Your body hurts. “Pain without a physical cause can be a symptom of depression,” says Jared Heathman, MD, a Houston-based psychiatrist. “And depression can worsen pain [due to other causes].” That could be because depression and pain follow similar mind-body pathways, so one can affect the other, according to a 2014 study conducted in the Netherlands. Depression-related pain can occur anywhere on the body, but often includes unexplained headaches and back aches, Dr. Heathman says. 9. You’re often in a “bad mood.” You’re snapping at your loved ones, short-tempered and impatient with everyone and everything, or bursting into tears for no good reason. “Crying when you’re not ordinarily a crier would be a sign,” says Dr. Saltz. These mood shifts are common with depression, especially if they happen frequently. Want to learn more? Read A Woman’s Guide to Depression and visit Lifescript’s Depression Health Center .
