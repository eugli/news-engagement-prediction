(ABC News: Penny McLintock) \nThey also used statistical adjustments to \"take out\" the effects of variable lifestyle factors including education level, sex, number of comorbidities (such as angina, heart attack, asthma), number of medications, smoking status and alcohol consumption. \nThe results showed that the more active people who walked an extra 4,300 steps per day — about three kilometres — needed one third of a day less in hospital for every year of follow up. \n\"Considering that a day in hospital costs about $1,800 or $2,000, that is a very sizeable health care saving if we can get people to be more active,\" Dr Ewald said. \nThe study also found that higher step counts were associated with fewer bed days for cancer and diabetes. \n\"There were less hospital admissions for cancer in the more active group,\" Dr Ewald said. \n\"Being more active protects you from all types of diseases including cancer.\" How to get your steps up \nThe average person walks about 6,000 steps per day, according to Dr Ewald. \nTo achieve a higher step count, he recommended people try to increase their incidental activity. \n\"It doesn't have to be done as one big trip, it can be broken up across the day,\" he said. \n\"Walk the kids to school instead of driving them ... walk to the shops instead of driving. \n\"Often people meet up for coffee, well it's really better for you to meet up for a walk and go for a bit of a stroll while you're having a chat.\" \nWhile the researchers did not measure how vigorously the participants were walking, Dr Ewald said there were extra benefits in upping the energy output. \n\"In terms of fitness, you do get something extra for running rather than walking,\" he said. \n\"High intensity is great if you can do it, but if you don't like that sort of thing just walking still has benefits. \n\"People should be aiming for 10,000 [steps] which would be better, but 8,000 is a good start.\" \nThe researchers also recommended in the report that health coaching, restricted parking availability and better urban design could help in increasing the physical activity levels of the community.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T09:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T05:33:25.886+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
