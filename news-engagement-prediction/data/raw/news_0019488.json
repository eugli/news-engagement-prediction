The child was trapped and secured by the seatbelt and the ATV’s safety netting. \n\"Within two minutes, Acadian Ambulance Services arrived and assisted in freeing the child from the cold waters.” Like us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T02:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T22:00:08.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
