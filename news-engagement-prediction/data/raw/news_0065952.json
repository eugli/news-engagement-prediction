A + A - A poster of the show Fatmagul. Picture courtesy: YouTube \nTurkish show Fatmagul has been adapted for Indian television. In fact, popular TV and film actor Rajesh Khattar and his wife Vandana Sajnani have already been roped in to play pivotal parts in the show. \nHere are five foreign TV shows we hope are remade for the Indian audience: \nZindagi A still from the show. Picture courtesy: YouTube \nStarring Fawad Khan and Sanam Saeed as protagonists, this Pakistani show's plot revolves around a couple of college students, who end up marrying each other, despite their vastly different backgrounds. \nFawad's Zaroon, a young and conventional Pakistani man and Sanam's portrayal of Kashaf, a fiercely independent and career-driven woman, are both believable and admirable. \nThe Office (UK version) Ricky Gervais in The Office. Picture courtesy: YouTube \nWritten by the brilliant Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, The Office has also been remade as an American series. \nThe show is a mockumentary that follows the lives of a group of office-goers, and their hilarious misadventures. Relatable and funny, The Office needs to be remade for the Indian television right now. \nWe can already see Satish Shah as David Brent and Sumeet Raghavan as Tim Canterbury (originally played by Ricky Gervais and Martin Freeman). \nHealer \nHealer is a South Korean drama that revolves around the lives of a famous reporter, a not-so-famous journalist, and a corrupt man called Healer who happens to possess great fighting skills. Together the three of them try and uncover a decade old mystery about a group of friends who used to run an illegal media company. \nIt has all the masala and content that we want to see in a decent TV series. \nSupernatural \nYes, you guys can stop rolling your eyes, we know we have enough supernatural to last us a lifetime on Indian TV right now. But they are all so sad, not to mention, bad. \nThe American show Supernatural however is neither bad, nor sad. \nIn fact, it is scary, funny, and emotional. Yes, all of the three. Supernatural's basic storyline follows a pair of brothers---Dean (Jensen Ackles) and Sam (Jared Padalecki)---as they go on a mission to find the whereabouts of their missing father. In this exciting journey, they are interrupted by a bunch of ghosts, demons and angels. \nAsk Laftan Anlamaz The lead actors of the show Ask Laftan Anlamaz. Picture courtesy: YouTube \nThis Turkish show falls in the office-romance category. Hayat wants a job desperately so that she can convince her father that she can take care of herself without having to marry anyone. She lands up in Murat's office, and even manages to get a job as his assistant. \nBut here is the twist, the company had hired someone else to be Murat's assistant, but some papers get exchanged and Hayat 'steals' the job, without informing the company that they had a mistake. \nHande Ercel and Burak Deniz were both gorgeous and believable as Hayat and Murat.
