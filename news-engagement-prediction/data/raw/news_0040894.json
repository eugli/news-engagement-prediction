Article continues below EA Sports announce Premier League winter upgrades on FIFA 17 Ultimate Team \nOusmane Dembele played a precise through ball to Aubameyang in the 10th minute, but the Dortmund forward squandered the glorious chance by skying his effort high over the bar. \nAnd the former Saint-Etienne man went agonisingly close 27 minutes later; failing to connect with a ball across the open goal mouth that would have given the German outfit the lead. Out of luck \nBut if Aubameyang thought his luck would improve as the game wore on, with his side now a goal behind, he was wrong. \nThe forward cut a frustrated figure after blazing over yet another golden opportunity, before seeing his tame penalty saved by Ederson as the Portuguese held on for a vital 1-0 first-leg home win. \nAnd Dortmund boss Thomas Tuchel replaced Aubameyang after 62 minutes, before cutting a frustrated figure on the bench. \nAubameyang's poor form at the Estádio da Luz came as a surprise, considering the forward had netted five goals in six appearances for BVB before heading to the Africa Cup of Nations with Gabon. AFCON fatigue \nBut it was that international tournament, Aubameyang claims, has led to his dip in form since his return to the Dortmund side at the end of January. \n\"I missed the preparation [for the second half of the season] through the Africa Cup of Nations,\" Aubameyang told Bild, per Goal. \n\"I have to admit, I'm a bit tired.\" \nThe Bundesliga's current top scorer netted twice in the first two of The Panthers' three AFCON fixtures, but a trio of draws against Guinea-Bissau, Burkina Faso and Cameroon was not enough to secure the host's progression to the knockout stages. \nAubameyang's focus will now be to ensure they overturn their 1-0 deficit against Benfica when the Portuguese outfit head to the Westfalenstadion on March 8. And the Gabonese forward will be desperate to make amends for his poor showing on Tuesday night. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
