It’s a remarkable admission by Republicans that their unqualified, rich fuck nominees can’t stand public scrutiny. The key line: \nVery few people at that level don’t have skeletons in their closet so you [need to] get confirmations done lickety-split.” \nSo much admitted in a single, simple sentence. \nFirst of all, the only thing that could protect these nominees from having their “skeletons” exposed is lightning-fast confirmations. Anything less than that, and these nominees can be properly exposed as the frauds that they are. \nAnd yes, they are frauds. Take this sentence: “Very few people at that level don’t have skeletons in their closet.” Now what exactly does that mean? It means that these assholes have used their positions of power and wealth to hurt, use, or abuse people, and to break the rules they expect everyone else to follow. And of course they have! They are not just billionaires (which in itself is not disqualifying), but conservative billionaires who have no problem associating themselves with the popular vote loser. That’s the part that is disqualifying. \nSenate Democrats have slowed the confirmation process to a crawl, and it’s working. Keep exposing these assholes. And if they don’t like it, they can always quit and go back to their lives of wealth and privilege.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:30:59.894+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
