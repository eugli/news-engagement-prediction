If they didn’t, you wouldn’t have customers or see the numbers growing. Sales on board have been well in excess of what we expected.\n'It’s a greater, better choice of food.’\nConsumers value what they get from BA. If they didn’t, you wouldn’t have customers or see the numbers growing BA announced it was going to scrap free food on short-haul flights in September last year.\nIt replaced them with a selection of sandwiches from M&S, with the service being introduced from January.\nAt the time, a Ryanair spokesman joked: ‘We welcome BA’s conversion to the Ryanair way.’\nThe changes come as BA faces the prospect of an inter-continental fares war with trans-Atlantic rivals such as American Airlines promising to reduce fares, and newer carriers such as Norweigian offering to fly travellers to the US for as little as £69.\nSO, WHO'S THE CHEAPEST?\nA price comparison of all the airlines showed that gin and tonics were the cheapest on EasyJet, while BA offered the best value cup of coffee.\nIAG reported higher profits in the year to December 31, up more than 30 per cent to £2 billion.\nBut revenue slid 1.3 per cent to £16.8 billion, and it warned the fall in the pound since Britain’s Brexit vote had delivered a £389 million hit.\nYOU'LL PAY MORE IN DUTY FREE TOO... Sandwiches available on BA flights are more expensive than on the High Street.\nThe same Marks & Spencer sandwich could have three different prices – one on the flight, one in the airport terminal and one in supermarkets.\nA bacon roll costs £4.75 on BA flights, but if travellers were to pick it up at the airport terminal before boarding the plane they could get it for £4. If they were to buy it in a supermarket it would cost just £3.25.\nA cheese ploughman’s is £3 on flights, £2.60 in the terminal and £2.25 in stores. Crisps cost £1 on flights, 85p in the airport and 70p on the High Street.\nWalsh insisted he was ‘relaxed’ about Brexit. ‘People talk about this in the context of the UK and Europe but BA flies all around the world,’ he said.\nIAG has benefited from reduced cost thanks to the low oil price.\nWalsh, who is due to be paid £2.4 million for 2016, said: ‘It was a good performance in a challenging environment. In 2016, we carried more than 100 million passengers – double the number British Airways and Iberia carried in 2010, a year before IAG was created.’\nThe group has been under pressure to offer low prices to compete with budget rivals and amid economic uncertainty. Revenue per passenger fell 5.4 per cent over the year.\nGeorge Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ‘Despite holding a premium position in the sector, IAG has been caught up in the trend for lower fares as increasing supply squeezes prices.\n‘However, with much of the supply coming in to the bottom of the pricing scale, there is an argument to say the group has a degree of insulation that more value-focused rivals lack.’\nIt announced a full year dividend of 23.5 euro cents per share, up 17.5 per cent on last year.\nIAG shares rose yesterday 4.5 per cent or 22.5p to 527p.\nDeals Of The Week Top rate: 5% on up to £2.500 FlexDirect 1.1% easy access rate Top savings deal Spend £10, get £15 bonus in ANY store New members only Best buy low rate card 5.85% APR £7+ in monthly rewards Blue Rewards", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=", "http://www.moneysupermarket.com/credit-cards/details/?productCode=CC_AA_TRANSFER_PLUS_CARD&index=3&count=106&selectedProductId=CC_AA_TRANSFER_PLUS_CARD&gid=CC_ALLCARDS&page=&source=THISMO1", "http://www.moneysupermarket.com/current-accounts/details/?productCode=CUR_barclaybnk_BankAcc_BlueRewards_tier_01_0_0&index=2&count=11&selectedProductId=CUR_barclaybnk_BankAcc_BlueRewards_tier_01_0_0&gid=CUR_OVERDRAFT&page=&source=THISMO1", "http://www.quidco.com/ref?cid=4831&utm_source=ThisisMoney&utm_campaign=ThisisMoney_AffiliateArticle&utm_medium=AffiliateArticle", "http://www.nationwide.co.uk/", "http://www.moneysupermarket.com/shop/third-party-promotion-click/?product_sku=SAV_RCIBANK_48F18975BBD543A59694F181F61CBE1C&source=TM1&channel_id=116"], "published": "2017-02-24T23:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T04:28:28.997+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
