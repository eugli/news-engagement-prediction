Puerto Vallarta presented a site near the shore. This week’s host, Club de Golf Chapultepec, is located in mountain terrain west of Mexico City. It’s a par 35-36=71 tipping at 7,330 yards, but at an elevation of approximately 7,500 feet, the field will be calculating an additional 10 percent or so on measurements. Compared to sea level, it means that the course could play at a translated length of 6,600-6,700 yards. This is why many of the golfers above have results referencing the 2014 BMW Championship contested at Cherry Hills in Colorado, the Barracuda Championship held in Reno, Nevada, and the European Masters in the Swiss Alps. \nClub de Golf Chapultepec opened in 1928 and hosted the Mexican Open from 1944-1960. Since, it’s been in a rotation, returning as the site for the national championship in 1974, 1981, 1991 and 2014. In its last spin three years ago, it played as a par 72 when the eighth hole was a 526-yard par 5. (It’s now a 525-yard par 4.) Oscar Alvarez prevailed by one at 17-under 271. The only golfer in this week’s field who competed here in 2014 was Roberto Diaz of Mexico; he placed T36. Current PGA TOUR rookie Julian Etulain finished T14, while PGA TOUR winner Ted Purdy missed the cut. Former member Alexandre Rocha tied for third. \nRough has been limited to two inches, and with a short track and so many opportunities to score, red numbers should be plentiful. Two of the three par 5s are longer than 620 yards – Nos. 6 and 11 – but six of the par 4s check up short of 410 yards. Undulating greens consisting of a blend of bentgrass and Poa are prepped to run 11.5 on the Stimpmeter. That’s a fair compromise for golfers traveling from all corners of the globe who are not accustomed to speedy surfaces. \nWhat’s more, unfamiliar greens benefit average putters. With a seven-year agreement through 2023 at Club de Golf Chapultepec, those who qualify can record and save data for future editions. With no cut in World Golf Championships, all who are in attendance will get four rounds to compile information on top of the experience. \nAfter a sun-splashed opening round on Thursday when the daytime high will be in the upper 70s, warmest of the tournament, the threat for rain enters the picture, albeit moderate at worst. Winds are expected to be light throughout, leaving math to determine projected distance as the primary challenge tee to green.
