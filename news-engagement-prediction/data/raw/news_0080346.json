But becoming a 'sanctuary city,' one that offers services to undocumented residents seeking asylum, is a provincial decision, not a municipal one.\n\"Because they're looking for health care, and education, and social services, and the city offers none of those. None of those services are even there to offer, that's why it's really not a municipality issue, but it could be if someone asked us to,\" says O'Brien.\nFredericton MP Matt DeCourcey says everybody deserves a fair shake.\n\"Canadians are telling us that they want a country that is open and accepting of people who come from challenging situations, and everybody who arrives here in Canada deserves a fair opportunity to seek asylum in our country,\" says DeCourcey.\n23 asylum seekers sought refuge after crossing the New Brunswick border last year. Halifax-based immigration lawyer Lee Cohen says that's just the beginning.\n\"The next question is, should we be doing something about it? The answer, in my opinion is yes, we should welcome these people,” says Cohen. “We should start getting organized now in order to be prepared to facilitate the numbers of people coming into our country, that I anticipate will start happening within the next month or two.”\nBut whether cities should become 'sanctuaries' isn't on the table just yet.\nWith files from CTV Atlantic's Laura Brown. \nPhotos Fredericton’s Mayor says he hasn’t decided which option is best for Fredericton, after a spike in asylum seekers crossing the border into Canada.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:53:39.713+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
