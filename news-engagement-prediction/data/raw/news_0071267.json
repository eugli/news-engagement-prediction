(Picture: David M. Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images ) \nViewers of the 37th Brit Awards thought something had gone terribly Awry during The 1975â€™s performance. Artist of the day 23/02: Baskery \nIt appeared that some little scoundrel had hacked the ITVâ€™s digital displays as while the band performed The Sound, behind them appeared some rather disparaging comments. \nComments like â€˜Theyâ€™re essentially making robitic Huey Lewis tunesâ€™ and â€˜this band thinks it has a charismatic singer.â€™ \nOUCH! \nJeez, those hackers appeared to have a real dislike for the band who won Best British Group. \nâ€” natalie (@crajoon) February 22, 2017 \nWell no, there was no hack, as fans of The 1975 will know. Theyâ€™re actually signs that flash up during the video for The Sound with a pretty poignant message behind them. \nSo nope, no hacking here, and ITV were not trolling their own act, as some viewers also thought. \nIt was the band gently mocking themselves, and giving a giant middle finger to the haters. @the1975 genius ðŸ˜‚ only band to hack their own performance and take the piss out of themselves ðŸ˜‚ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T16:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T11:27:47.845+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
