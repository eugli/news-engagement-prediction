We've seen very little footage from Iron Fist , but even though there's a big question mark still hovering over it, we do know one thing: it's going to kick ass -- at least as far as fighting is concerned. You don't make a show about a magical kung-fu warrior and not make the fight choreography as amazing as possible. Case in point: check out this pick of Danny Rand about to kick some guy in the head. â€” Iron Fist (@MarvelIronFist) February 3, 2017 \nThe official Iron Fist Twitter account shared a new picture that features Finn Jones ' Danny Rand locked in combat with an unnamed henchman (we assume there's going to be a LOT of those). It looks like the fight is taking place in a nondescript warehouse of some sort. Judging by the weapons rack full of katana's and other medieval blades in the corner of the tweet, we're going to assume this is a hideout for ninjas. From the looks of it, Iron Fist's jacket sleeve has been ripped clean off, so is he having trouble against this one guy or is he in the middle of fighting multiple guys? The caption on the post reads, \"Focus. Breath. Strike.\" \nDaredevil may be the king of combat right now, but Iron Fist is a real contender for that crown. The original Marvel/Netflix series has had two seasons of great stunt choreography, but if anyone can usurp the champ, it's Iron Fist . Fighting is sort of Iron Fist's whole deal and it'd be a shame if the show fell flat in that area. Plus, Iron Fist has the benefit of superpowers to add a level of fantasy to his fight scenes that should help set him apart from the competition. \nFor more of Iron Fist in action, check out the trailer from the highly anticipated series. \nIron Fist stars Finn Jones as the title character, a.k.a. Danny Rand, who, after a tragic accident causes the death of his parents, finds himself taken into the mythical city of K'un-Lun, where he is raised and taught martial arts by the locals. Now possessing the power of the Immortal Iron Fist, he returns home after fifteen years to reclaim his family company and fight a bunch of ninjas. The series also stars Jessica Henwick , David Wenham, Jessica Stroup, Tom Pelphrey, and Rosario Dawson . \nIron Fist is set to hit Netflix on March 17, 2017.
