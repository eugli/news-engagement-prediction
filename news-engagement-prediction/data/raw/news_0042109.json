The resolution, however, gives authority to Humaid Al Qutami, Director General of Dubai Health Authority , to extend this deadline if required.\nThe resolution defines the implementation phases for beneficiaries, entities responsible for providing the service and the deadlines for implementation. It states that the Government of Dubai is responsible for providing health insurance coverage for UAE nationals from 1 June 2015 and employers are responsible for providing health insurance coverage for expatriate employees from January 1, 2014.\nThe resolution also obligates sponsors and guardians to provide health insurance coverage for their families and domestic workers from January 1, 2014.\nThe Resolution stipulates that the health insurance requirements should include the provision of an essential health insurance plan approved by the DHA. The health insurance card must be issued by an approved entity and the insurance policy must adhere to the relevant bylaws.\nThe Mandatory Health Insurance Law No (11) came into effect in 2014 to be implemented in phases. Deadline for Phase I that covered companies with 1,000 or more employees, ended on October 31, 2014. Similarly, deadline for Phase 2 covering all companies with 100-999 employees ended on July 31, 2015. Phase 3 that was covering companies with 100 or less employees and includes every resident, including domestic workers and dependents of employees, ended on June 30, 2016. However, owing to delays and massive number of applications, the deadline was extended up to December 2016. On Sunday, the new deadline issued by the Executive Council Resolution stipulates that all residents must have health insurance cover by March 31, 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T16:26:14.773+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
