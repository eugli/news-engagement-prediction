AFGC, said it rejected the report's findings as it \"deliberately fudged\" the concepts of advertising that targets children and food advertising generally. \nHe said the Cancer Council's report measured all food advertising, which is almost entirely directed at adults. \n\"The advertising to children codes are what the name suggests: They're about advertising directed at children because adults are well able to make their own choices and take responsibility for themselves, just as parents are best placed to make decisions for their children,\" he said. \n\"The codes deliberately target programs when children are likely to be viewing TV on their own, without parental supervision, which is the rationale for removing promotion of non-core foods during these programs.\" \nIn regards to calls for government intervention, he said overseas experience showed it didn't reduce childhood obesity rates. \nAt least one-quarter of Australian children are overweight or obese, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and this figure is increasing. \nMs Watson held her ground, saying the codes had \"loopholes\", including the requirement that a third of the audience had to be children for an ad to be considered targeting children. \n\"We observed that in Sydney alone there were 40,000 children watching the rugby league and 30,000 watching Masterchef, but they only made up about 10 per cent of the audience, so a junk food ad in those shows would still technically comply,\" she continued. \nOn the point about the overseas experience, she said in Quebec in Canada, where there were advertising restrictions, children were eating less junk and fast food. \nMichael Moore, chief executive of Public Health Association of Australia, said, as a starting point, junk food ads heavily associated with sport targeting children should be restricted. \n\"This junk food industry, like the alcohol industry has particularly targeted sport, because they're trying to associate a healthy activity with an unhealthy product and benefit from the halo effect,\" he said. \nA McDonald's spokeswoman said as a QSRI signatory, the chain took its responsibility as an advertiser seriously. \n\"Advertising to children represents less than 2 per cent of our total media budget and we only promote healthier options when communicating to children,\" she said. \n\"Today over a third of all Happy Meals sold in Australia include either a seared chicken wrap, apple slices, low-fat flavoured milk, fruit juice or water.\"", "external_links": [], "published":
