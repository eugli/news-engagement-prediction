Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA woman with a rare condition that causes her to suddenly faint has revealed it even occurs during sex . \nLaura Crow, 28, was diagnosed with debilitating postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) in 2011, after the condition was triggered by her first pregnancy. \nThe rare condition means Laura's resting heart rate is a whopping 110 beats per minute – around 40 beats higher than the average person. \nBut triggers including adrenaline and excitement can cause Laura's heart rate to peak to as high as 180 beats per minute – causing her to pass out. Laura Crow with her husband Ben (Photo: Caters News Agency) \nIt's led to some tricky situations – and Laura has even passed out while getting steamy with her husband Ben, 28. \nMum-of-three Laura, from Southend-on-Sea, Essex, said: \"Whenever I have sex, there's a 50/50 chance I'll faint. \n\"The fainting can happen anywhere, any time – but with PoTS it's usually a case of gravity taking over, so the best way for us to do it is missionary, with me lying down. \n\"The first time it happened it was a massive shock for both of us. \n\"Ben gets very upset – when I wake up he is very distressed, even though he never continues after I've passed out. \n\"Once I faint I don't know what's going on, but it's very traumatic and worrying for him. \n\"But luckily it doesn't affect our relationship. \n\"He's the strongest rock I could ever ask for.\" Laura with her husband Ben and three children (L-R) Ralph, 3, Dylan, 6 and Faith, 1 (Photo: Caters News Agency) \nBut it's not just sex that makes Laura pass out – other triggers include not getting enough sleep, temperature, laughing, exercise and anything that causes her heart rate to increase, like watching a horror movie. \nLaura, who has been with Ben for eight years and married for nearly five, had been perfectly healthy up until she fell pregnant with her son Dylan in late 2009 - but out of the blue she started fainting, sometimes several times a day. \nAfter numerous tests, she was finally diagnosed with PoTS in 2011. \nShe said: \"When I was around four weeks' pregnant, I passed out and went to the doctors. \n\"I'd never fainted in my life until then. \n\"The first doctor I saw said it was just part and parcel of pregnancy, but another doctor sent me for tests. \n\"I think I had had the PoTS before then, but it just took the pregnancy and the 'trauma' to my body to trigger it.\" \nAt one point, Laura was passing out up to seven times a day. \nBut after having her second two children – Ralph, three, and one-year-old Faith – her symptoms started to ease. \nLaura still has to be careful to try and avoid situations that can lead to fainting – but with a husband and three young children, it's not always possible. Laura Crow with her husband Ben (Photo: Caters News Agency) \nLaura said: \"We did think twice about having more children – but at the time they didn't know if it was a hormone problem that had triggered the PoTS, so it potentially could've gone away with another pregnancy. \n\"It did get better – I used to pass out seven or eight times a day, but after my second and third pregnancy it's only once or twice a day. \n\"Laughing is also tricky - Ben is a tickler every time he tickles me I laugh myself to a faint! \n\"Even when playing with my children - we could be running around, joking and laughing, and the next minute I'm on the floor. \n\"But I'm not going to stop laughing or having sex in the name of PoTS.\" Read More Heartbreaking pictures show how young mum was ravaged by the \"cruellest disease known to man\" \nNow, Laura generally only faints once a day, but she has to have a carer with her 24 hours a day just in case she passes out. \nShe also struggles with other conditions linked to PoTS, including Elhers-Danlos Syndrome, inappropriate tachycardia syndrome and dis-associative seizures. \nLaura is now looking into applying for a support dog, which will be able to alert her when she's about to faint, so she can get some of her independence back. \nShe said: \"Even when I don't pass out, the symptoms are debilitating in themselves – I also have to be careful about doing things which will trigger fainting, which could be anything! \n\"I can't be the mum I want to be – I dreamed of being a 'normal' mum who could do the school run by myself, do sensory classes with my babies without falling unconscious, who can stand on the playground every day without any assistance or pop out with the kids and get an ice cream. \n\"The children are amazing though – my six- and three-year-old are registered as young carers.
