Lee Gi Kwang challenged Son Dongwoon, saying, “No matter what you do, you can’t beat me,” and Son Dongwoon answered, “I was like an athlete at this when I was young.” \nThe first win went to Son Dongwoon, to Lee Gi Kwang’s disbelief. Naturally, the two had to have another round, with Lee Gi Kwang arguing the first was just a dress rehearsal. With Lee Gi Kwang’s second loss, however, he had to take the punishment of a flick to the head from his younger groupmate. \nYou can watch the episode with subtitles on Naver V Live .
