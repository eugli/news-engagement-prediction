(Andrew Sampson/CBC)\nThe sport can be a magnet for injuries too.\nDowden listed many side-effects that have more in common with contact sports like football and hockey than swimming.\n\"I'm actually not swimming because I just got a concussion at the last meet,\" she said.\n\"A lot of times you get kicked in the face. We also do our throws where someone jumps off and does back flips and stuff like that, and that's very easy for people to land on you, so it's really easy to get concussions and broken bones.\"\nSome athletes competing nationally While the sport's popularity has ebbed and flowed over the years in Newfoundland, there are now four teams, in St. John's, Mount Pearl, Conception Bay South and Corner Brook, that compete on the provincial circuit.\nOlympic-sized dream: St. John's teen picked for national synchronized swimming team\nAthletes are also beginning to participate at the national level too, said St. John's Sea Stars coach Jackie Hiscock .\n\"We're slowly working our way up the grids. We have a couple athletes this year that we're hoping to make top 35 this year in Canada and when they do that they will have an invitation to try out for the national team.\"\nBut with growth comes tempered expectations: many pools in St. John's aren't equipped to provide the training needed for athletes who want to compete against teams from better equipped provinces, said Hiscock .\n\"But we're certainly doing our best to promote the sport, and encourage the girls we have, and encourage any newcomers who want to give it a try.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T01:45:12.189+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
