Among these is the 30% increase in water prices had was just announced today in Parliament by Heng Swee Keat, which is supported by PAP MPs such as the area cleaning queen Lee Bee Wah who said that the hike is meant to stress the importance of water among S'poreans. Advertisement \nNow, if the PAP is convinced that what it is doing is right and for the good of the people, why doesn't it implement these price increases during the election year? \nWhy wait until after the elections to raise all the fees? Surely the 69.9% can appreciate the good that their Party is doing for them, right? \nSadly, we think the real reason why the PAP can keep doing this is because the majority of S'poreans either stupid, have short memory or are just plain complacent place their blind trust in a Party that has run out of ideas other than to use fee hikes to squeeze the people and collect more revenue. \nOr maybe they are as LKY calls them - sheep; happy to be led by the sheep dog. To the slaughterhouse. Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
