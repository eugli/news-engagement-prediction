While the No Doubt songstress tells Extra! she has “absolutely no” plans to go country, she admits she’s learning so much about the genre.“I don’t have a country album, no. I have a country playlist that I’m learning,” she says. “It’s interesting, I’ve learned a lot about country music in the last couple of years.
