The rest of the airline's fleet of domestic Boeing 737 and Airbus A330 aircraft will follow from mid-2017 onwards. \nThe airline said the new services would give passengers \"no shortage of entertainment\". \n“We know that email, online shopping and general web browsing will be popular uses when we switch on Wi-Fi, but what a lot of people relish about flying is being able to catch up on their favourite TV shows or watch movies they didn’t get to see at the cinema,” said Qantas Group Executive of Brand, Marketing and Corporate Affairs, Olivia Wirth. \n“Foxtel and Netflix both have huge catalogues that are expanding all the time, so there will be no shortage of entertainment on board,\" she added. \n“The usage data from the collection of albums we already have on our aircraft shows that music is a great way for passengers to relax as they watch the world fly by. Spotify will open this up so you can listen to virtually any song you like.\" \nQantas added in its statement that it is also currently in talks with suppliers to extend Wi-Fi services onto its international and regional (QantasLink) fleets to \"develop a product that can overcome a number of technical, performance and coverage challenges, including options for Wi-Fi over large stretches over water\". - CNA/nc", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T20:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T15:56:16.943+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
