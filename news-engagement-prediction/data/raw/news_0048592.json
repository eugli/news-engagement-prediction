It’s not going to work on Trump. He doesn’t fit that mold. They’re trying to every day. It’s kind of comical to watch.”\nHe added, “Trump won the election, on substance. Trump did more interviews. He explained his agenda more than any political presidential candidate ever has in my memory. And he has tried to stick to it.”\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN\n Rush Limbaugh", "external_links": ["http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/facebook/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fvideo%2F2017%2F02%2F19%2Frush-limbaugh-the-media-did-not-make-donald-trump-and-they-cant-destroy-him%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Rush+Limbaugh%3A+%E2%80%98The+Media+Did+Not+Make+Donald+Trump+and+They+Can%E2%80%99t+Destroy+Him%E2%80%99", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/WucIdPYGrCw", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/google_plusone_share/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fvideo%2F2017%2F02%2F19%2Frush-limbaugh-the-media-did-not-make-donald-trump-and-they-cant-destroy-him%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Rush+Limbaugh%3A+%E2%80%98The+Media+Did+Not+Make+Donald+Trump+and+They+Can%E2%80%99t+Destroy+Him%E2%80%99", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/twitter/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fvideo%2F2017%2F02%2F19%2Frush-limbaugh-the-media-did-not-make-donald-trump-and-they-cant-destroy-him%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Rush+Limbaugh%3A+%E2%80%98The+Media+Did+Not+Make+Donald+Trump+and+They+Can%E2%80%99t+Destroy+Him%E2%80%99&shortener=bitly", "https://twitter.com/pamkeyNEN"], "published": "2017-02-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T17:31:55.202+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
