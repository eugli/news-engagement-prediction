Four-hour target \nHealth Secretary Jeremy Hunt has previously said performance in elements of the NHS in England was \"completely unacceptable\" . \nHis comments came as record numbers of patients spent more than four hours in accident and emergency units in England in January, according to figures leaked to the BBC . \nFigures showed that 82% of patients in A&E - rather than the target 95% - were transferred, admitted or discharged within four hours during January. \nThe number of operations cancelled by the NHS in England also hit a 15-year high last year. \nA total of 82,730 planned operations were cancelled at the last minute for non-clinical reasons - a third higher than in 2010.
