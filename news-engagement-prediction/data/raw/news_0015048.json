After Australia had won the trophy by thrashing New Zealand 3-0 in the series in Australia, the Kiwis have extracted revenge and wrested the trophy back in their hands by clinching the series 2-0 in New Zealand. \nAfter a narrow six-run win in Auckland and a wash-out in Napier, New Zealand secured a thrilling 24-run win in Hamilton to clinch the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy 2-0. The architects of the win were Ross Taylor, who smashed his 16th century and Trent Boult, who picked up 6/33, his career-best haul in ODIs to complete their eighth consecutive home bilateral ODI series win. \nDespite some resistance from the lower-middle order, Australia once again came up short as they lost a series in New Zealand for the second consecutive time. Travis Head notched up his fifth fifty and Marcus Stoinis, the hero of Auckland, threatened a repeat with 42 off 48 balls but in the end, Boult’s spell towards the end proved to be the difference. Ross Taylor joined Nathan Astle on top of the list for most centuries by a New Zealand batsman with 16 (Getty Images) \nDuring the course of the ODI, both Taylor and Boult notched up some individual records. \nTaylor smashed his 16th century and his second against Australia to help New Zealand reach 281/9. He joined Nathan Astle on top of the charts for the highest number of ODI centuries by a New Zealand batsman. Astle, in 223 ODIs, also has 16 and Taylor has a chance to go past that record when New Zealand play five ODIs against South Africa towards the end of February. Ross Taylor has the joint-most number of ODI hundreds for New Zealand with 16. (Hindustan Times) \nTaylor also a chance to join his mentor, Martin Crowe, on top of the list for centuries in Test cricket. Currently, he has 16 tons in 80 Tests while Crowe holds the long-standing record with 17. The right-hander can achieve it in the upcoming three-Test series against South Africa. \nHis 16th century also gave him another record. Taylor, who bats at No.4 in ODIs, smashed his 14th century from that position, putting him level with South Africa’s AB de Villiers, who also has 14 tons but from only 118 matches. Trent Boult picked up his second five-wicket haul in ODIs as he notched up the fifth-best figures by a New Zealand bowler in ODIs. (Getty Images) \nBoult strikes Australia again \nThere is a saying that a lightning bolt never strikes twice in the same place. However, no one told that to Australia as they were once again struck down, this time by a ‘Boult’ of lightning from the New Zealand pacer. \nThe left-arm pacer had wrecked Australia with his first five-wicket haul of 5/27 during the 2015 World Cup clash in Auckland. In Hamilton, he produced a decisive spell of bowling to finish with 6/33, his best figures in ODIs. The haul of 6/33 by Boult is the fifth-best haul by a New Zealand player in ODIs. Trent Boult is only the second New Zealand bowler to take a six-wicket haul against Australia in ODIs. (Hindustan Times) \nTim Southee’s 7/33 against England in Wellington in 2015 tops the list, followed by Shane Bond’s 6/19 against India in Bulawayo in 2005 and his haul of 6/23 against Australia in the 2003 World Cup encounter in Port Elizabeth. Scott Styris is fourth on the list with 6/25 against West Indies in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad 2002. \nHowever, Boult is only the second New Zealand player ever to take a six-wicket haul in an ODI against Australia. Once again, Bond tops the list with 6/23 which he achieved in the 2003 World Cup. \nWith this win, New Zealand have displaced India and moved to third in the ODI rankings. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T19:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T13:34:03.568+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
