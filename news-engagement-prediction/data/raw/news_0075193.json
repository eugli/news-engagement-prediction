(Photo: Getty) Share   \nThere's nothing more embarrassing than bumping into someone who is wearing the same outfit as you. \nSo when the entire world is watching, it makes it far worse. \nAt Sunday's 89th annual Academy Awards, Michelle Williams and Emma Roberts wore near-identical dresses. \nManchester By The Sea star Michelle, who was up for Best Supporting Actress, was sporting a plunging Louis Vuitton gown to the annual bash, while Emma stunned in an Armani ensemble. \nWhile they were not exact matches, the floaty skirt and deep-v necklines were very similar.
