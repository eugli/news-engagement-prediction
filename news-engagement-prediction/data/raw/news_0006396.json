He said Iranian actions “undermine security, prosperity, and stability throughout and beyond the Middle East and place American lives at risk”. \nFlynn did not specify how the new administration would respond. Asked for clarification, the White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, said that the president wanted to make sure the Iranians “understood we are not going to sit by and not act on their actions”. \nAli Vaez, an Iran expert at the International Crisis Group in Washington, said: “It’s either an empty threat or a clear statement of intent to go to war with Iran. Both are reckless and dangerous ... In an attempt to look strong, the administration could stumble into a war that would make the Afghan and Iraqi conflicts look like a walk in the park.” \nThe Trump team repeatedly signalled during the election campaign that it would take a much tougher line towards Tehran. Both Flynn and the new defence secretary, James Mattis, have long portrayed Iran as a serious strategic threat to US interests. \nEarlier on Wednesday, the Pentagon confirmed that Mattis had spoken by phone to his Saudi counterpart, Prince Mohammed bin Salman. \nAccording to the defence department account, the conversation “reaffirmed the importance of the US-Saudi Arabia strategic relationship, particularly to countering new and emerging security challenges in the Middle East”. \nAccording to the Saudi version, the discussion was more pointedly aimed at Iran, and both men expressed “their full rejection of the suspicious activities and interventions by the Iranian regime and its agents”. \nFlynn used his appearance at the daily White House press briefing to criticise the Obama administration, which he claimed had “failed to respond adequately to Tehran’s malign actions – including weapons transfers, support for terrorism, and other violations of international norms. \nHe noted that Donald Trump had “severely criticised the various agreements” the previous administration and the UN made with Iran as being “weak and ineffective”. It was an apparent reference to the nuclear deal the US and five other major powers made in July 2015 , which was then formalised in a UN security council resolution, under which Iran drastically reduced its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief.

As of today, we are officially putting Iran on notice.” \nDuring his tenure as the head of the Defence Intelligence Agency, Flynn was reported by the New York Times to have told his subordinates he had concluded that Iran was behind the 2012 terrorist attack on the US diplomatic compound in Benghazi in Libya , and ordered them to find evidence to prove it. \nThe DIA found no evidence of any Iranian connection to the attack, which was carried out by a Sunni extremist group, Ansar al-Sharia. \nIran is a Shia-run state, which sees Sunni militancy as a serious threat. \nThe threat, along with the administration’s refugee ban, represent major departures from previous US foreign policy, and came from the White House before the administration’s designated secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, had been confirmed. \nTillerson was confirmed in the Senate just over an hour after Flynn’s threat but he will inherit a state department in turmoil, with a growing wave of internal resistance against the executive order suspending arrivals from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The state department has also been the main institutional backer of the Iran nuclear deal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T03:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T22:45:36.333+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
