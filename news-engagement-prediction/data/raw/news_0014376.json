Are they really on the verge of breaking up? I texted Gretchen for the real score. Her reply: “Sorry, I’m not ready to talk yet. Hope you understand.” \nWhatever it is they’re going through, hopefully it’s just a cool-off period. Since Valentine is in the air, Cupid ought to come to their rescue. \nVina in trouble ADVERTISEMENT \nMy heart goes out to my “Sis,” Vina Morales. Avi Siwa, the former live-in partner of her French boyfriend, Marc Lambert, has filed multiple complaints versus Vina. Avi and Marc have a love child. \nAvi reportedly claimed that Vina picked a fight with her and threatened her in a bar last December. I have not yet talked to Vina about the issue. But knowing how sweet and mild-mannered she is, I don’t think she’s capable of hurting a fly. Marc better stand by Vina. \nOgie’s ‘hugot’ songs \nFor every stage of love, there’s an Ogie Alcasid song to go with it. His music has kept us company every heartbeat and heartache of the way. \nLet Ogie serenade you, along with Erik Santos and Ai-Ai delas Alas, on V-Day in “#Hugot Playlist” at the Kia Theatre on Feb. 14 at 8 p.m. (call 911-5555). ’Tis the season to be cheesy and mushy. Hugoteros and Emoteras, unite! Ogie Alcasid (right) and daughter Leila \nHere’s my chat with Ogie: \nWhat do you remember most about your Miss Universe 1994 experience? Playing Manolo of Manila was my biggest exposure during the early days of my career. I met my ex-wife (former Miss Australia) Michelle van Eimeren during the prepageant festivities. I was able to visit Dakak and Pearl Farm for the first time. \nWhat are your Top 5 hugot songs? “Kailangan Kita,” “For the First Time,” “Ikaw Lamang,” “Nandito Ako” and “Sa Kanya.” \nTell us about your daughter Leila’s blog. Her blogsite is leilaalcasid.com. She’s a gifted writer. Her teachers in Australia have always told us how much they appreciated her work. In her blogs, she relates to her readers the details of how she prepared for her return to Manila and our Christmas holiday last year. Since then, she has posted two more entries. \nWhat makes you proud as a dad? I am most proud that I’m close to all three of them. Under the difficult circumstances, I made sure that the necessary sacrifices must be made so that my relationship with them would never be affected. God has provided opportunities for those things to happen. He is amazing! \nWhat’s your advice to the future boyfriends of your daughters? My daughters are very good children, but they will not tolerate boys/men who take advantage of them. My prayer is that they fall in love with a knight, because they’re our princesses. \nHow does it feel to be back in ABS-CBN after working with GMA 7 and TV5? I feel so blessed to have worked with all three networks. Now that I am back in ABS-CBN, where my career began, I can only thank the Lord for his goodness. I cannot even remember being in conflict with anyone in my entire TV career. I’m still trying to “find my way back” as a Kapamilya but, so far, everyone has been welcoming.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T23:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T08:32:59.568+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
