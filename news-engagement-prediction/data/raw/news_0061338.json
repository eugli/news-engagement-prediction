Google blamed an issue with its Google Accounts engine for the problem, which forced OnHub owners offline in the middle of the US day, erasing their saved settings and forcing them to re-enter their network information. \nFrustrated customers took to Google’s forums, Twitter, and other social networks to complain that their routers had been disabled. Some worried that their routers had been bricked entirely, having tried — and failed — to connect to their own networks after unplugging and power cycling the devices. Google itself offered advice on how to connect devices to its routers once they were back up and running, but admitted that in some cases, they “may not be a perfect workaround.”\nCustomers reported that Google was slow to provide advice on the problem. The company initially said just that it was looking into the issue, while confusion led to hour-long hold times for tech support phone lines. A few hours after later, Google offered a solution: the devices would need — and would now respond to — a hard reset. The company also sent an apology to OnHub and Google Wifi customers, stating that although performance and software would not be compromised, customers would need to set up their home networks all over again after the factory wipe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T06:27:31.759+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
