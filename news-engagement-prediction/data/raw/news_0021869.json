It was ostentatiously exhibited for Valentine's Day. \nValentino Donna opens as if it has lots of red fruits in it, which you would not find in the pyramid, but there's definitely something that smells sour and fruity. It's the kind of note I usually try to avoid in lux fragrances, because its lack of endurance is usually reimbursed with cloying lollipop sweetness, so I prepared to get disappointed ... but it did not happen. \nThey mention a leather note in its base, but in my perception, leather was actually the first thing I smelled, which is how I came to a description of this fruity sourness along with some cheeky dirtiness. For a moment I thought of Narciso Rodriguez and his ultra modern clean and dirty musks. Sometimes tiny nuances distract your attention (and very often enchant you) from the main accord, and that would be rose in Valentino Donna. Perfumy sweet rose in a nice powdery environment. It has a big trail and a young feeling of artificial, or in nicer words girly (like a girls' dream of the smell of flowers using their passionate imagination, but limited experience) floralcy. \nLeather subsides in a little while and the berry-like feeling yields to sweet and warm pink vanilla, although it never fades away, providing a refined lining to the delicate rosy perfume. \nThe commercial starts as an old Italian movie and strangely suggests (in French) the recollection of somebody or something you already have known before. It is surprising for such a young perfume to bring a memory at all, but having started remembering and following the heroine down narrow streets and in the round squares of an old Italian city, I could not stop, and went all the way to a heartbreaking finale of Cinema Paradiso, when Salvatore meets the daughter of the love of his youth (you find this plot addition only in the 2002 director's cut, otherwise you can still get your portion of emotions from these 3 minutes of the final scene here): \nOf course, it would be too much for a simple and careless Valentino Donna , but the refined lining I mentioned before prompts a bold heritage: old squares and narrow streets will always be trodden by heels of young girls. Elena Knezhevich founded Fragrantica together with Zoran Knezevic in 2007. Since then Elena has taken care of its design and content as the Editor-in-Chief. Elena was born in Russia, studied Slavic languages and literature in Moscow, and lived in Sarajevo and Belgrade, where the idea of Fragrantica was born. Now she resides in California. \"I have had a nomadic life style since I was born, changing homes, cities and countries. I love having this island on the Internet that I built myself, to reach from everywhere and feel at home. \nAdvertisement Add Your Review Become a member of this online perfume community and you will be able to add your own reviews.
