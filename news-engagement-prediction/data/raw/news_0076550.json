I just want to thank her for being such a soldier through this process.\" \nAli had previously spoken about his Muslim faith when he won the Screen Actors Guild Award for best supporting actor last month. \nHe said his mother \"didn't do back flips\" when he converted to Islam 17 years ago but they quickly realised \"that stuff is minutiae, it's not that important\". \n\"We see what happens when you persecute people - they fold into themselves,\" he said at the SAG Awards. Moonlight wins Best Picture as La La Land mistakenly announced \n\"I'm so grateful to have the opportunity to play Juan who saw a young man folding into himself as a result of persecution in his community and took the opportunity to tell him that he matters, that it was OK and he was accepted. \n\"I hope we do a better job of that.\" \nAfter his Oscar win was announced, Ali embraced Moonlight director Barry Jenkins and buttoned his tuxedo jacket on his way to the stage. \n\"My grandma would want me to button up,\" he said. \n\"I want to thank my teacher and my professors, they told me is that it's not about you, it's about the characters, you are in service to your character and your stories, I'm so blessed to have had this opportunity.\" \nAdditional reporting by the Press Association More about: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T19:53:32.849+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
