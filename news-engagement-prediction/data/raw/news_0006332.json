This is part of our family tradition,” said Ziaul Huq Zia, the Upazila Krishak League joint convenor who hosted the feast.\nLocal police made security arrangements for the party while some 1,500 volunteers worked for seven days in the lead-up to the event. \nMostly disposable plates were used in two separate sitting arrangements – chair-table for the distinguished guests and mat on the floor for the less privileged ones. Besides the sumptuous meal, village sports and folk song competition were also arranged on the occasion.\nJoypurhat Deputy Commissioner Abdur Rahim told bdnews24.com that he heard about the programme but did not have any details. \n“The local tax department should be informed before arranging this kind of programme,” he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T10:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:20:17.130+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
