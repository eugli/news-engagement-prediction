This is a very short video teaser which confirms that both the Huawei P10 and Huawei P10 Plus will be announced on February 26, which is the day after tomorrow. Both devices will be announced during the company’s press conference at MWC 2017, which is something a lot of people assumed will happen, but this teaser confirms it. \nBoth of these two devices have been leaking for quite some time now, though the Huawei P10 leaks were far more frequent lately, which brought up the question whether the company plans to introduce both smartphones during MWC 2017, or just the Huawei P10. Well, now we know the answer to that question, and thanks to a number of leaks that surfaced in the past couple of weeks, we more or less know what to expect out of these two devices. What seems to be an official render of the Huawei P10 leaked quite recently, and the device also surfaced on GFXBench not long ago. Both the Huawei P10 and Huawei P10 Plus are expected to sport a metallic design, and two camera sensors on the back. The Huawei P10 and Huawei P10 Plus will probably sport 20-megapixel and 12-megapixel shooters on the back, same sensors the Huawei Mate 9 ships with. Leica’s lenses will be placed on top of those camera sensors, and the dual-LED, dual tone flash will be located next to those two sensors. \nThese two phones will almost certainly ship with the Kirin 960 64-bit octa-core SoC, which is Huawei’s very own processor. This is the company’s most powerful chip at the moment, and it is fueling the Huawei Mate 9. Android 7.0 Nougat or Android 7.1 Nougat will come pre-installed on the Huawei P10 and Huawei P10 Plus, and Huawei already confirmed that the Emotion UI (EMUI) 5.1 will be pre-installed on the two devices, which is a new version of the company’s Android skin. Huawei’s MWC 2017 event kicks off at 2PM (CET) on Sunday, so stay tuned, we’ll get far more information in only a couple of days. Until then, feel free to check out Huawei’s official teaser, it’s embedded down below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T22:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T18:43:39.935+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
