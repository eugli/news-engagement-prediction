There is no evidence to back up that assertion.\nBy Friday evening, Ellen L. Weintraub, a federal election commissioner, released a statement calling on him to “share his evidence with the public and with the appropriate law enforcement authorities so that his allegations may be investigated promptly and thoroughly.”\nGet Ground Game in your inbox: Daily updates and analysis on national politics from James Pindell.
