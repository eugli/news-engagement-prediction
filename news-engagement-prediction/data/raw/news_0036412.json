Korte, CEO of LMI Aerospace. From his LinkedIn page. Handout \nLMI manufactures components for aerospace customers. Handout \nLMI manufactures components for aerospace customers. Handout \nLMI's headquarters in St. Charles \nLMI Aerospace, a St. Charles-based aerospace components manufacturer, will be sold to Sonaca Group of Belgium for about $191 million, the companies announced late Thursday. \nThe merger is not expected to reduce employment in the St. Louis area, said Dan Korte, LMI’s CEO. “We see no change in our footprint here in the St. Louis metro area,” he said in an interview Friday. \nUnder the agreement, LMI shareholders will receive $14 per share in an all-cash transaction, the company said. The offer represents a 52 percent premium over LMI’s closing share price Thursday of $9.19. \nLMI’s stock rose nearly 49 percent Friday to close at $13.66 a share. \nAfter the deal closes, LMI will operate as LMI Aerospace — a member of Sonaca Group, with headquarters remaining in St. Charles. Korte will continue to serve as LMI Aerospace’s CEO. \n“Sonaca committed to letting us continue to run the business as we’ve been running it,” said Korte. \nIn the St. Louis area, LMI has operations in St. Charles, Washington and Cuba. The expansion at the Washington plant will continue, Korte said. \nLMI employs 385 people in St. Charles, 140 in Washington and 125 in Cuba. \nSonaca and LMI are both aerospace parts makers, and LMI has an engineering unit. The two companies make “very similar” products but serve different customers, Korte said. \nLMI’s biggest customers are Boeing, Spirit AeroSystems and Gulfstream. About 9 percent of LMI revenue comes from defense contracts. Sonaca’s biggest customers are Airbus and Embraer. \nSonaca sees the purchase as an entree to Boeing, while LMI wants to do more business with Sonaca’s customers. The merger was about market expansion, not cost savings, Korte said. \n“We are now the largest company in the world at what we do,” Korte said. \nThe Washington plant is expanding to fill a contract involving the Boeing 737. \nSonaca paid “a fair price for a valuable asset,” said Mark Jordan, analyst at Noble Financial. \nLMI showed losses from 2012 through 2015, and lost $31.5 million in the first nine months of last year. But its future looked much brighter, according to Jordan. \n“There was very significant and visible growth expected over the next three years,” said Jordan. \nLMI had landed much larger contracts for the next version of the Boeing 737 airliner. The 737 now accounts for about 30 percent of LMI revenue and “you could see that doubling,” said Jordan. \nLMI also had a “very strong and growing relationship” with Gulfstream, winning contracts on its next generation corporate jets, he said. \nLMI’s stock had been concentrated in the hands of a few large institutional holders, Jordan noted. Those holders can get impatient and pressure management. \nThe $14 buyout price is nearly double the share price as of last fall, and allows the big shareholders to cash out without waiting for the profit turnaround to be apparent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T18:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T03:32:22.906+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
