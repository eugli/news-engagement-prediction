The deal includes an invite to Major League camp, and it will pay Garcia a $2.5 million bonus, according to MLB.com's Jesse Sanchez. \n• Spring Training : Info | Tickets | Schedule | Gear \nGarcia, who will be 24 next week, has been a free agent since December. He is a right-handed hitter capable of playing all three outfield positions. \nGarcia slashed .315/.395/.517 while playing for the Tigres de Ciego de Avila in Cuba in 2016.
