In a December 2016 blog post to fans, he said the treatment had not been totally successful.\nThe Vinyl Cafe, a weekly CBC show broadcast in both Canada and the United States, started in 1994 and focused on the life and misadventures of Dave, owner of a small record store, and his wife Morley.\nMcLean, who began his career as a journalist making CBC radio documentaries, wrote a series of best-selling books based on the show. He started taking The Vinyl Cafe on the road in 2008, traveling to both Canada and the UInitd States.\n\"Stuart was an exceptional storyteller who has left an indelible mark on CBC Radio and countless communities across Canada,\" Susan Marjetti, executive director of CBC Radio, said in a statement.\nMcLean was awarded the Order of Canada in 2011 \"for his contributions to Canadian culture as a storyteller and broadcaster\". He won Canada's Leacock medal for humor three times, most recently in 2007.\n(Reporting by David Ljunggren; Editing by David Gregorio)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T01:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:14:06.365+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
