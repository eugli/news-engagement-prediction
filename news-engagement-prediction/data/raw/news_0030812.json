It was the perfect match and we are delighted with the result,\" Di Maria told beIN Sports. \n\n\"To go through we will need to produce another performance like this. We scored four goals but they are capable of doing the same thing.\" \n\nPSG had twice been eliminated from the Champions League at the hands of Barcelona in the previous four seasons, and the Catalans also had a fearsome record in games against sides coached by Emery, losing just one of 23 before this. \n\nBut Luis Enrique's team, for all the brilliance of Lionel Messi , have recently looked more fragile than in a long time and the French champions showed no fear. \n\nThey were without injured captain Thiago Silva and the suspended Thiago Motta, meaning a start for Adrien Rabiot in midfield and a Champions League debut in defence for 21-year-old Presnel Kimpembe. \n\nDraxler also made his European debut for the club and the German was superb as PSG pressed Barcelona high right from the off -- the home side had already worked Marc-Andre ter Stegen in the Barca goal before they got the opener. \n\nThe menacing Draxler was fouled just outside the area and Di Maria bent the resulting free-kick over the wall and in for his third goal in the Champions League this season. \n\nCrocked following an early foul by Rabiot, Neymar was off the field receiving treatment as the Parc des Princes crowd erupted. \n\nHe was able to continue, but the visitors were lacklustre, Luis Suarez starved of service, Messi quiet and skipper Andres Iniesta struggling to cope. \n\nOne Neymar acceleration did lead to an Andre Gomes shot that was turned behind by Kevin Trapp, yet otherwise the chances were at the other end. \n\nTer Stegen saved from Draxler after a counterattack, but there was nothing he could do as the German made it 2-0 five minutes from half-time, exchanging passes with Marco Verratti and rifling a shot past the goalkeeper from the right side of the area. \n\nThe expectation was that Barcelona would come out fighting after the restart but instead they fell further behind in the 55th minute to a piece of brilliance from Di Maria. \n\nThe move started with Trapp rolling a goal-kick out to Rabiot on the edge of his own box and the midfielder turning away under pressure from Messi. It ended with Di Maria curling a left-foot shot high into the top-left corner of the net from the edge of the other area. \n\nDi Maria then came off to a standing ovation, but Paris were not finished. Thomas Meunier surged forward from right-back and set up Cavani, who thumped home his 34th goal of the season in all competitions. \n\nA miserable night for Barcelona was compounded when Samuel Umtiti hit the post late on.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T16:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T07:04:39.345+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
