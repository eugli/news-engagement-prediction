Share this video Get daily   \nAlien life may have evolved on at least three of the worlds orbiting a cool dwarf star known as TRAPPIST-1, located in the constellation Aquarius. \nTo celebrate the discovery, Google has a special Doodle by artist Nate Swinehart. \nThree of these planets lie within the star's \"habitable zone\" where surface temperatures range from nought to 100 degrees centigrade. \nAll seven planets could have liquid water – key to life as we know it – under the right atmospheric conditions, but the chances are highest with the three in the habitable zone.

NASA discovers Earth-like planets Share this video Watch Next \nThe findings were published on Wednesday in the journal Nature , and announced at a news briefing at NASA Headquarters in Washington . \nIn contrast to our sun, the TRAPPIST-1 star, classified as an ultra-cool dwarf, is so cool that liquid water could survive on planets orbiting very close to it - closer than is possible on planets in our own solar system.

The TRAPPIST-1 star, an ultra-cool dwarf, has seven Earth-size planets orbiting it. This artist's concept appeared on the cover of the journal Nature on February 23, 2017. \nBased on their densities, all of the TRAPPIST-1 planets are likely to be rocky. Further observations will help determine whether they could have liquid water on their surfaces. \nThe mass of the seventh and farthest exoplanet has not yet been estimated – scientists believe it could be an icy, \"snowball-like\" world, but further observations are needed. \nThe planetary system was identified by NASA's orbiting Spitzer telescope, with help from several ground-based telescopes - including the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope and a robotic telescope operated by Liverpool John Moores University. Liverpool John Moores University's robotic telescope (Photo: PA) \nSpitzer, an infrared telescope that trails Earth as it orbits the sun, was well-suited for studying TRAPPIST-1 because the star glows brightest in infrared light. \nMeanwhile, the Liverpool telescope, located on La Palma in the Canary Islands, helped detect the planets as they passed in front of their star.
