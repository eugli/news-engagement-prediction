I have even had some moms tell me they’ve already been following my routine for years unknowingly.” \nFollowing the success of her blog post, Ethington posted a video breaking down the method on her Facebook page. \nEthington, who has a 10-year-old, 8-year-old and 5-year-old, said she hopes her “real” guide comforts her fellow parents dealing with an unending series of kid messes. \n“My biggest goal with my blog has always been to take away the unrealistic expectations we often see on social media, and help moms realize that they don’t have to be perfect at everything to be good parents,” she told HuffPost. \n“So often we see the pretty side of people’s lives on social media, and often, that pretty side sets us up for feeling like we are failing because we are trying to live up to unrealistic expectations,” she added. “I just hope it makes a mom feel less alone and like she is doing a good job even if her house doesn’t look like a magazine.” \nShout-out to all the parents who haven’t seen their bare floors in years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T03:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:39:21.171+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
