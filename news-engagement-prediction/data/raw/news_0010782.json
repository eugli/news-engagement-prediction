Without presenting any evidence, Trump tweeted “many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country.” (See the tweets below.)\nShortly before that one, the president tweeted: “What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.?”\nLast night, federal Judge James Robart issued the TRO, prompting Trump to call him a “so-called judge” e arlier today. The White House has said the Department of Justice will defend the president’s executive order.\nTrump’s reference to “a Homeland Security travel ban” comes just hours after the Department of Homeland Security itself suspended all actions pertaining to the president’s travel ban order, and the State Department resumed accepting the visas of people arriving from the seven majority-Muslim named in Trump’s executive order.\nWhat is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.?\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017\nBecause the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. A terrible decision\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017\nThe latest presidential tweets come on an afternoon when MSNBC and CNN were featuring heavy coverage of the nation’s third consecutive weekend of anti-Trump protests. Today’s rallies in New York City, Washington D.C., Los Angeles, Houston, Philadelphia, Miami and West Palm Beach (heading to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Florida resort, or at least as close as possible) erupted in response to a week of legal back-and-forth over the president’s exec-ordered travel ban.\nWorldwide, rallies were held today in Paris, London and Tel Aviv.\nWhile not given the non-stop coverage of the Women’s March on January 21 or last weekend’s airport rallies, today’s significantly smaller protests, along with the Trump tweets, dominated MSNBC and CNN airtime.\nEven Fox News interrupted its Houston-based pre-Super Bowl coverage with an exasperated Shepard Smith briefly debating Fox News legal analyst Mercedes Colwin who said the travel ban “was not against a religion.” Said Smith, after assuring viewers that he and Colwin were good friends, “it’s just another name on the same thing. That’s the complaint from those who think this is ridiculous.”\nOn CNN and MSNBC, coverage shifted from the various protests that included large showings of LGBTQ protesters. In New York, the crowds gathered near the Stonewall Inn, the historic West Village bar that’s become a symbol of gay rights.\nThe afternoon rally was organized to show LGBTQ solidarity with immigrants and refugees targeted in Trump’s executive order. At one point, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer led the NYC crowd in a “Dump Trump!” chant.\nRelated stories\nDonald Trump Compares Iraq War Political Advocates To Vladimir Putin In Super Bowl Interview With Bill O'Reilly\nPresident Donald Trump Tweet-Blames Judge, Plugs Fox Interview\nTrump Vows To \"Win\" Travel Ban; Circuit Court Denies Immediate Reinstatement - Update\nGet more from Deadline.com : Follow us on Twitter , Facebook , Newsletter", "external_links": ["http://deadline.com/2017/02/donald-trump-bill-oreilly-super-bowl-interview-1201902265/", "https://bit.ly/1BdD1TM", "http://on.fb.me/MifyrT", "http://deadline.com/tag/travel-ban/", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/827996357252243456", "http://on.fb.me/MifyrT&quot;", "http://deadline.com/2017/02/donald-trump-tweets-homeland-security-fox-news-1201902966/&quot;", "http://deadline.com/2017/02/donald-trump-blasts-travel-ban-restraining-order-twitter-1201902504/&quot;", "http://deadline.com/2017/02/donald-trump-bill-oreilly-super-bowl-interview-1201902265/&quot;", "http://deadline.com/tag/msnbc/&quot;", "https://bit.ly/1BdD1TM&quot;", "https://bitly.com/1fz7Oji&quot;", "http://deadline.com/2017/02/justice-department-appeal-judges-travel-ban-1201902687/", "http://deadline.com/tag/protests/", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/827981079042805761", "http://deadline.com/tag/cnn/&quot;", "http://deadline.com/tag/fox-news/", "http://deadline.com/tag/cnn/", "http://deadline.com/2017/02/donald-trump-tweets-homeland-security-fox-news-1201902966/", "http://deadline.com/2017/02/donald-trump-blasts-travel-ban-restraining-order-twitter-1201902504/", "http://deadline.com/tag/fox-news/&quot;", "http://deadline.com/2017/02/justice-department-appeal-judges-travel-ban-1201902687/&quot;", "https://bitly.com/1fz7Oji", "http://deadline.com/tag/msnbc/"], "published": "2017-02-05T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T16:17:26.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
