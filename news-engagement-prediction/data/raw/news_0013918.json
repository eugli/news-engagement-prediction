Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images By Jacob Lauing 2017-02-06 04:18:16 UTC \nDonald Trump — whose ties to the New England Patriots were a major headline heading into this weekend — picked the Patriots to win Super Bowl LI, . But as the game unfolded, his support for the eventual champions wavered. SEE ALSO: Julio Jones is basically Michael Jackson with this unreal catch \nThe Atlanta Falcons jumped ahead to a 21-0 lead, and Trump soon left his own Super Bowl watch party, according to reports . New England fell behind by 19 points heading into the fourth quarter, making it look to many like Atlanta had this in the bag. And Trump seems to have felt the same. It's 28-3 in the third quarter and the president has left his Super Bowl party \n— Jennifer Epstein (@jeneps) February 6, 2017 \nThe Patriots' slow start brought out many to accuse Trump for jinxing the New England team. The #trumpjinx in full effect \n— BLACK PHANTOM (@BLACKPHTM) February 6, 2017 I blame Trump for this #SuperBowl #TrumpJinx \nAnd then, after the president left his watch party, the Patriots surged, tying the game in the game's final minute, sparking the first overtime in Super Bowl history. Hey @TheFix , notice that the game turned around as soon as Trump tweeted it was boring? \n— Braun Film & Video (@BraunFilm) February 6, 2017 If the Patriots come back, Trump never left his party. \n— Will Leitch (@williamfleitch) February 6, 2017 \nThat's exactly what happened. The Patriots pulled out an insane comeback, scoring 19 points in the fourth quarter and a touchdown in overtime to win the Super Bowl. \nAnd there was Trump, ready to congratulate his team on Twitter, as if he had been watching the whole time. What an amazing comeback and win by the Patriots. Tom Brady, Bob Kraft and Coach B are total winners. Wow! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2017 \nSo, to recap, Trump picked the Patriots to win, stopped watching when they fell behind, and rejoiced when New England came back. \nFair-weather fandom at its finest.
