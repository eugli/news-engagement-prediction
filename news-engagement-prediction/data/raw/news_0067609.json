For English, like most languages, has expanded over the years through assimilation of words from other tongues. As people of different languages intermingle, inevitably some of the words of one language become words of the other. \nIt doesn't take someone who studies etymology to look at a Spanish-language Web site (or the Web sites in nearly any other language) to see how English vocabulary, particularly as it relates to technical subjects, is spreading. And while English now may be giving more words to other languages than it is absorbing, that wasn't always true.

The third major source is the names of foods whose names have no English equivalent, as the intermingling of cultures has expanded our diets as well as our vocabulary. As you can see, many of the words changed meaning upon entering English, often by adopting a narrower meaning than in the original language. \nFollowing is a list, by no means complete, of Spanish loanwords that have assimilated themselves into the English vocabulary. As noted, some of them were adopted into the Spanish language from elsewhere before they were passed on to English.
