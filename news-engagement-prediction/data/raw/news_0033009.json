Fantasyland had been closed until late in the day.  AP Photo Fullscreen Walt Disney sits on a rock in front of the Sleeping Beauty Castle in the Fantasyland section of Disneyland on opening day of the amusement theme park in Anaheim, California on July 17, 1955. A year earlier, Disney made his move. He succumbed to the lure of television and arranged to tie in the TV show (he hosted) with a Disneyland park.  AP Photo Fullscreen One of Disneyland's original attractions from opening day and arguably Walt Disney's personal favorite, the trains of the Disneyland Railroad have covered enough track in 50 years to circle the earth more than 200 times. The trains provide guests an overall view of the park as well as the Grand Canyon and Primeval World dioramas.  Disney Fullscreen After ground was broken in a former orange grove in Anaheim on July 21, 1954, Disneyland opened its gates a year (and $17 million) later. Finishing touches were still required, yet to open in a year was a remarkable accomplishment, especially considering it took today’s Imagineers 18 months to design and install a new fireworks show for the 60th anniversary.  Disney Fullscreen Three people walk hand-in-hand in front of a castle at Fantasyland in Disneyland in Anaheim, California on July 5, 1955. The park opened to visitors on July 17, 1955.  AP Photo Fullscreen One of Disneyland’s largest revamps occurred in 1983 with the complete renovation of Fantasyland. The flat fantasy faire facades were replaced with a detailed medieval design that extended the look of Sleeping Beauty’s Castle. The spinning cups of the Mad Tea Party were moved closer to the Matterhorn.  Disney Fullscreen Gov. Goodwin J. Knight, left, Walt Disney, right, and Virginia Knight, wife of the governor, back seat, take a ride in an antique-styled automobile at Disneyland near Anaheim, Calif., at the premiere opening on July 17, 1955. Twenty-two thousand guests, including many notables, were invited.  AP Photo Fullscreen In front of an early rendering by Disney legend Peter Ellenshaw, Walt Disney unveils his plans for Disneyland to a national television audience during the premiere of \"Disneyland\" the television show, October 27, 1954.  Disney Fullscreen At one point, singing birds were the height of animatronic technology. When Walt Disney (shown here in 1963) unveiled the Tiki Room, it featured the most sophisticated machinery devised by Imagineers. Though the mechanical movements now seem quaint, the Tiki Room remains open and features more than 200 birds, tikis and flowers.  Disneyland Resort Fullscreen When the Disneyland Hotel first greeted guests in October 1955, rooms were $15 and visitors rode trams to the park entrance. In 1961 the monorail line was extended to the hotel, providing even more convenient access to Disneyland.  Disney Fullscreen Despite a rocky opening day with unexpected crowds and some unfinished attractions, Disneyland drew more than a million visitors in just seven weeks, surpassing expectations. Admission was $1, and attractions were 10-35 cents. According to a first-year news release from Disneyland, guests spent an average of $2.37 per visit. Today it’s likely a hundred times that.  Disney Fullscreen Sleeping Beauty’s Castle was inspired by Neuschwanstein Castle in Germany. Thanks to forced perspective, where higher levels of a building are built on a smaller scale to suggest greater height, the 56-foot-tall iconic Disneyland castle appears to be much taller. Operators lowered the drawbridge on opening day (and did so again in 1983 to reveal the new Fantasyland). The drawbridge has since been immobilized.  Disney Fullscreen When Disneyland opened July 17, 1955, its area dedicated to the future could have been called “We’ll have it finished by Tomorrowland.” Though the TWA Rocket to the Moon was ready in time, the land was bereft of Disney-quality exhibits. Highlights included the Hall of Chemistry as well as the Clock of the World, which told time around the globe (and older kids probably still met up with their parents later than promised).  Disney Fullscreen Originally covered with orange groves and made up of parcels of land owned by 17 different people, Walt Disney purchased 160 acres in Anaheim to build his dream of a place where parents and children could have fun together.  Disney Fullscreen In 1957 the future was plastics, and so the Monsanto House of the Future was aptly named. For 10 years, visitors to Tomorrowland were amazed by a house with the latest tech, including adjustable lighting, a microwave oven and a wall-mounted (non-operational) TV. Floors, walls and most of the furniture were plastic, making it easy to clean and hard to tear down (legend has it that after a wrecking ball bounced off its walls, the house had to be sawed apart).  Disney Fullscreen Walt Disney \"meets\" some residents of the 'it's a small world' attraction at Disneyland in California, during construction in May, 1966. One of the most popular Disney attractions of all time, the show is a fun-filled and whimsical salute to the children of the world that conveys its message of peace and harmony through the international language of music.  Disney Fullscreen Former child star and future diplomat Shirley Temple joins Walt Disney at the opening of the Sleeping Beauty Castle walkthrough at Disneyland on April 29, 1957. The walkthrough, located inside the iconic castle, featured the story of Disney's 'Sleeping Beauty' told through a series of dioramas.  Disney Fullscreen Walt Disney reviews a model for the Matterhorn Bobsleds which opened in 1959 at a height of 147 feet.  Disney Fullscreen Hundreds of children run through Sleeping Beauty Castle after the long-awaited lowering of the drawbridge into Fantasyland.
