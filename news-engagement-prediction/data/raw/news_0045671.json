Woman turned away by doctors 14 times died from undiagnosed tumour \nBecky Aspinall, 28, used to be the ‘life and soul of the party’ but was diagnosed with the disease which causes rapid physical and mental deterioration, at just 20 years old. \nHuntington’s, which is a genetic condition, usually starts displaying symptoms when the carrier is in their 40s or 50s. \nBut sadly Becky inherited the condition from her father who was diagnosed when she was only four-years-old and later died in care. Becky has lost the ability to walk, talk and live on her own and needs 24-hour care. (Picture: Mirrorpix) \nNow, she has lost the ability to walk, talk and live on her own and needs 24-hour care. \nHer mother, Lisa Kelly, told The Mirror : ‘This disease takes everything away slowly – firstly your behaviour is affected then physical things start to go. What is Huntington's Disease? Huntington’s disease is an inherited condition that damages certain nerve cells in the brain. It can affect movement, cognition and behaviour It is caused by an inherited faulty gene Symptoms include personality changes, mood swings and irritability There is no cure for the condition \nSource: www.nhs.uk \n‘I once heard someone say if the devil had made a disease, Huntington’s would be it. And that’s how I would describe it.’ \nShe added that her daughter, who used to enjoy holidaying in Magaluf and Amsterdam, no longer looks like herself, having been left thin and with broken teeth because she can no longer clean them. \nTo make things even more difficult, Becky’s condition began to show after she fell pregnant with her son and doctors asked about genetic conditions in the family. \nSoon after, Becky began suffering the early symptoms, including a twitching leg and slurred speech. \nAt 20 weeks pregnant, she was then given the agonising decision of whether to terminate her pregnancy or not. \nShe refused after having already chosen her son’s name. Now Lisa cares for her grandson Alfie as well as still looking after her Becky, who says she doesn’t want to be fed by a tube once she loses the ability to swallow.
