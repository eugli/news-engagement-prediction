A date for the end of its run hasn’t been announced. \nAfter two years of testing, the chalupa made its national debut on Jan. 26. The shell of the sandwich looks a lot like a taco and is made with all-white chicken. It’s packed with lettuce, tomatoes, cheddar cheese and avocado ranch sauce. \nPoetsch says Taco Bell is “confident it will be returning to the menu in the future.” Previously from Chicago News ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:43:22.962+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
