According to the charge sheet, he faces multiple changes of child porn, rape, sexual assault and producing porn.\nSeveral laptops, external hard drives, cellphones, memory cards, a DVD, PlayStation console and a mini spy-camera, believed to belong to Knoop, were seized during the raid.\nAccording to Women and Men Against Child Abuse, Knoop preyed on single mothers and their children.\nThe anti-abuse group claimed Knoop had attempted to distribute these images internationally.\nHe was apprehended after an alert was raised by the United States' Homeland Security unit.\nHe is expected to appear in court again on Friday.", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/News24/SouthAfrica/Articles&sz=600x50&c=2133253752&t=artid%3d3c2d5619-b441-4f73-a757-3309eea61ae9%26Places%3djohannesburg%26Topics%3dcrime%26accreditation%3dnews24%26posno%3d1", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/News24/SouthAfrica/Articles&sz=600x50&c=2133253752&t=artid%3d3c2d5619-b441-4f73-a757-3309eea61ae9%26Places%3djohannesburg%26Topics%3dcrime%26accreditation%3dnews24%26posno%3d1"], "published": "2017-02-08T13:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T14:12:53.120+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
