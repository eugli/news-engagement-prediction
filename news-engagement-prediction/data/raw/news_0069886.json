Her customer interactions help families find solutions that protect what’s important to them. \nHusband Tommy is a Deputy with the Gwinnett County Sheriff’s Department in the DUI, Drug, and Veteran’s Treatment Courts. He protects the public by helping people better themselves rather than re-offend. His job is not without risks and Brande recognizes that. \n“When people are angry about being in jail they have nothing but time to think of ways to hurt him,” she said. “There have been a couple of instances where I wanted him to change jobs.\" \nTo help provide peace of mind to first responder families like the Maloys, State Farm teamed up with the home security company Canary to launch Protect the Protectors . The program donates Canary devices to first responders so they can watch activity in their homes through a smartphone. “ We want to acknowledge first responders for the work they do and dangers they face,” said John Carter, head of communication for Canary. “There’s a person behind the badge and they have families.” \nBrande proudly joined 29 State Farm Agents at a September event where home monitoring devices were provided to Gwinnett County sheriff deputies. \n“As the wife of a law enforcement officer, I have a heightened awareness of the high risks police face on the job. The donation of the Canary devices was gracious and falls in line with our (State Farm) focus on helping life go right.” \nTommy also praised the program. \n“Being able to check my phone and see my home and family while I am at work is great,” he said. “The kids may not like it, but I do.” \nExtending the Protection \nDuring the very first Protect the Protectors event in December 2015, 400 home monitoring devices were donated to Allentown, PA first responders. Protect the Protectors has since donated more than 5,000 home monitoring devices to police and fire departments. \nState Farm employee Josh Boyd volunteered to help distribute devices to more than 300 Irving, TX police officers. It was a special honor for Josh, his dad, Larry, served the citizens of Irving for 12 years as police chief before retiring in 2016. \n“At one point my dad stopped being a police officer because my mom was too scared,” Josh said. “But he went back because that’s what he’s passionate about. Officers face risk every day and I am pleased the company I work for has chosen to appreciate them.” \nLearn more \nTo learn more about a Canary special offer for State Farm customers, visit the State Farm Home Protection & Automation website.
