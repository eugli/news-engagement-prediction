We want to be as prepared as we can to meet all of the challenges along the way.\"\nLeft-handed pitcher JC Cloney will get the opening day start, and Tylor Megill, a transfer from Cypress College, will start Saturday's game.\nCloney went 8-4 last year with a 2.45 era in 18 games pitched for Dave Lawn’s staff. In last season's opening game against Rice, Cloney pitched 7 innings giving up only a run and four hits.\nThe senior from Castaic, California will face off against Eastern Kentucky's Jack Piekos. A transfer from Florida Southwestern State College, Piekos had a 4.76 era in 75 and 2/3 innings last season.\nIt's not clear yet what the Cats' starting lineup will be, but Johnson spoke highly of freshmen Matt Frazier, Cameron Cannon and Nicholas Quintana. Las Vegas native Quintana is expected to get the start at third base to start his first season.\nThe incoming recruiting class was ranked No. 4 in the country by Collegiate Baseball and No. 10 by Baseball America.\n\"I think all three of them will have a learning curve but I think they're well positioned to be real good players here for a long time,\" Johnson said this week.\nCesar Salazar (12), JC Cloney and Nick Quintana will all be big parts of Arizona's 2017 season Jesus Barrera/GOAZCATS.com Arizona has a number of returning players expected to be in the starting lineup. Second baseman JJ Matijevic looks to build off a season where he hit .287 with 17 doubles and 37 RBI. Meanwhile, catcher Cesar Salazar hit .276 in his freshman season with 9 doubles and 28 RBI. Sophomore Alfonso Rivas will be transitioning from the outfield to first base.\nCenter fielder Jared Oliva is expected to make a bigger impact this season. Oliva hit just .240 last season, but he says he has made a number of adjustments to his hitting approach since then.\n\"We made a couple of simple adjustments hitting wise, making sure my eyes stay locked in on the pitcher and not to turn my shoulders when I load,\" Oliva said. \"It's helped me see the ball and that's the biggest thing hitting. It's developed more consistent at bats.\"\nEven with a number of new freshman and transfer students, Oliva said everyone has acclimated and that the team chemistry has been solid - something that helped the 2016 Wildcats throughout their run to Omaha.\n\"I've been really impressed with all the junior college transfers coming in, the freshman who college transfers coming in, the freshman who come in, everyone got pretty acclimated really fast,\" Oliva said. \"The freshman, they don't play like freshman. They come in they just move right along with everything. Quintana, Frazier, Cannon, I could go on and on.\"\nArizona’s season opener is set to begin at 6 p.m. MST Friday night while Saturday’s first pitch has been moved up to 1 p.m. because of potential inclement weather. Sunday’s game is also set for a 1 p.m. start while the four-game series will wrap up Monday morning with a 10 a.m. start.\nRELATED: Jay Johnson discusses Friday's season opener Edit", "external_links": ["https://res-5.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/lxanriufh8ljilswre2i", "https://res-5.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/lxanriufh8ljilswre2i)"], "published": "2017-02-17T20:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T05:35:28.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
