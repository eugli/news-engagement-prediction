There is a human cost.” \nHe went on to compare the situation at the embassy to “something out of a John le Carré novel”. Guillermo Lasso participates in a televised debate in Quito Credit: Rodrigo Buendia/AFP/Getty Images \nH owever, it appears unlikely that Lasso will have the opportunity to fulfill his pledge, as he is trailing seven points behind Lenín Moreno, the ruling Country Alliance party's candidate. \nThe first round of voting is due to take place on February 19, and candidates require at least 40 per cent of the vote, with a 10 per cent margin to win at the first round. \nJulian Assange first entered the Ecuadorian embassy in June 2012 when he sought and was granted asylum as he faced extradition to Sweden to be questioned over allegations of rape - which he denies. \nHe was on bail at the time, having been held and then freed by police, meaning he breached his bail conditions and cannot now leave without being arrested. \nMr Assange has maintained that if he travels to Sweden to defend himself, he will risk being extradited to the US to face trial over the Iraq war leaks.
