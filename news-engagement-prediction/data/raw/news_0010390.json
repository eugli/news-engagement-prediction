Born out of the many turbulent times in Turkey, the band's third album promises its fusion of post-rock, jazz, and psychedelia that the band is so well-known for. \nOne of the new songs off this set, called “ Vertigo ,” is a wild ride that is as pleasantly unsettling as it is entertaining. The band creates an escape from traditional jazz and rock, and mixes it with fusion and a flavor of folk. No matter which song they serve up, no matter what style, Gevende’s music transports the listener to another time and place. It is basically a different journey with each song they perform. \nOut of Eskisehir, Turkey Gevende is composed of Ahmet Kenan Bilgiç on guitar and vocals, Okan Kaya on bass, Gökçe Gürçay on Drums, Ömer Öztüyen on viola, and Serkan Emre Çiftçi on the trumpet. The band's music was also featured on the soundtrack of the computer game Monochroma that was released on X-Box One last year. \nColleen Bement: Please share with your fans the inspiration behind your new album Kırınardı. \nAhmet K. Bilgiç: If the happiness of a whole town depended on one child being tortured every day, what would the town people do? Would we leave or stay if where we live were Omelas of Ursula le Guin? Kırınardı is an attempt to have space for hope among worries, to salute the place where the first daylight hits. \nOkan Kaya: The faith of not being separated by being caught in the storm of political or humanitarian facts in this geography. A sentence that was spread us from our dearest friends; Çıplak Ayaklar Kumpanyası. “Do not get used to hopelessness!” \nCB: How does creating your beautiful music in these difficult times affect you all? Does it give you hope? Does it give you encouragement? \nAKB: The human doesn’t take action for hope or courage or being able to take action doesn’t solve all the problems. Going on your own path has a priority. We are living the repetition of the history. In this repetition, we are able to breathe just going on what we really want to do. Life still goes on. \nOK: Music brings me closer to the life itself. On the other hand, the effort that we are spending, to be together, gives strength not just to us, to the audience as well. At the end, this becomes a big cycle and gives a positive perception for the future to everyone. \nCB: Let’s help fans get to know you all better. What inspired each of you to become a musician? \nAKB: “Back to the Future” movie! I met rock n Roll with the cheese which Michael J. Fox plays \"Johnny B Goode.\" \nOK: Learning, practicing, getting lost, finding, expressing; but at the first step folk songs.
