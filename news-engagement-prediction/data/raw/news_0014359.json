Its expansion into the so-called interbank bond market, which is restricted to institutional investors and accounts for 90% of the country's total bond market, takes advantage of the Chinese central bank's decision last year to loosen entry restrictions.\nBond financing accounted for only 12% of China's corporate debt at the end of 2015, compared with well over 20% in emerging markets such as Mexico and Korea, according to a report from Deutsche Bank.\nJPMorgan's revenue from debt-underwriting was little changed last year, at $3.16 billion, accounting for about half of its investment banking fees. The company's shares slipped 0.2% to $87.03 in New York on Monday, paring their gain so far this month to 2.8%.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T19:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:11:24.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
