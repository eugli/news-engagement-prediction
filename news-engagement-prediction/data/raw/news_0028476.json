Spurrier left Florida for the NFL at the conclusion of the 2001 season. \n“We finished third in the nation that year and didn’t win anything,” Spurrier said. “That Tennessee loss was so crucial, because I really thought we had a team that could go all the way. Losing that game hurt a lot. I don’t know if you ever completely get over a loss like that.” \nIt was the regular-season finale for both teams, as the game was postponed to Dec. 1 after the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States forced the matchup to be moved from its customary third week in September date. Florida and Tennessee both entered as top-five teams with 9-1 records, but the Gators were 17-point favorites. A trip to the SEC title game was on the line, and another win there would have meant a trip to the national championship game in the Rose Bowl. \nThe Vols pulled off a 34-32 upset behind a Herculean effort from running back Travis Stephens, who rushed for 226 yards and two touchdowns. It was the first time that season an opponent scored more than 23 points against Florida. Auburn beat the Gators 23-20, but no other team even eclipsed 17 points on Florida's defense until Tennessee's victory. \n“We had such a super, super team that year,” Spurrier said. “That’s why the loss was so hard to take. Tennessee ran it right down our throats.” \nNeither team ended up playing for the national championship that season — Miami defeated Nebraska — as Tennessee was on the wrong end of an upset to LSU in the 2001 SEC Championship Game. But Tennessee's upset of Florida will likely always hang in the back of Spurrier's mind.
