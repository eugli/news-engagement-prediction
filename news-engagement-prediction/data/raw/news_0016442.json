Image copyright Amnesty International Image caption Former detainee Omar al-Shogre before his arrest and shortly after his release from Saydnaya \nBefore their execution, detainees were brought before a \"military field court\" in the capital's Qaboun district for \"trials\" lasting between one and three minutes, the report says. \nA former military court judge quoted by Amnesty said detainees would be asked if they had committed crimes alleged to have taken place. \"Whether the answer is 'yes' or 'no', he will be convicted... This court has no relation with the rule of law,\" he said. \nAccording to the report, detainees were told on the day of the hangings that they would be transferred to a civilian prison then taken to a basement cell and beaten over the course of two or three hours. \nThen in the middle of the night they were blindfolded and moved to another part of the prison, where they were taken into a room in the basement and told they had been sentenced to death just minutes before nooses were placed around their necks, the report adds. \nThe bodies of those killed were allegedly then loaded onto lorries, and transferred to Tishreen military hospital in Damascus for registration and burial in mass graves located on military land. \nOn the basis of evidence of the testimony of its witnesses, Amnesty estimates that between 5,000 and 13,000 people were executed at Saydnaya over five years. Witness accounts \nA former judge who saw the hangings: \n\"They kept them [hanging] there for 10 to 15 minutes. Some didn't die because they are light. For the young ones, their weight wouldn't kill them. The officers' assistants would pull them down and break their necks.\" \n'Hamid', a former military officer who was detained at Saydnaya: \n\"If you put your ears on the floor, you could hear the sound of a kind of gurgling. This would last around 10 minutesâ€¦ We were sleeping on top of the sound of people choking to death. This was normal for me then.\" \nFormer detainee 'Sameer' describes alleged abuse: \n\"The beating was so intense. It was as if you had a nail, and you were trying again and again to beat it into a rock. It was impossible, but they just kept going. I was wishing they would just cut off my legs instead of beating them any more.\" \nSource: Amnesty International \nAlthough it does not have evidence of executions taking place since December 2015, the group says it has no reason to believe they have stopped and that thousands more were likely to have died. \nAmnesty says these practices amounted to war crimes and crimes against humanity. \nIt also notes that death sentences have to be approved by the grand mufti and by either the defence minister or the army's chief of staff, who are deputised to act on behalf of President Bashar al-Assad. \nThe human rights group says it contacted the Syrian authorities about the allegations in early January but has received no response. \nLast August, Amnesty reported that an estimated 17,723 people had died in custody as a result of torture and the deprivation of food, water and medical care between March 2011 - when the uprising against President Assad began - and December 2015. That figure did not include those allegedly hanged at Saydnaya.
