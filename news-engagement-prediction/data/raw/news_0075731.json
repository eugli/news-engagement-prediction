Trump immediately counterattacked the actress as being \"overrated.\" \n“Of all the great actors here in Hollywood, one in particular has stood the test of time for her many uninspiring and overrated performances,” Kimmel said. “From her mediocre early work in The Deer Hunter and Out of Africa to her underwhelming performances in Kramer vs Kramer and Sophie’s Choice , Meryl Streep has phoned it in in over 50 films.” \nStreep, noticeably embarrassed from Kimmel's comical jabs, hid behind her husband. \nAlthough Kimmel told everyone to give the Florence Foster Jenkins actress an \"underserved round of applause,\" the elite actress received a standing ovation instead. Concluding his banter with Streep, Kimmel complimented her dress, by saying \"Nice dress by the way, is that an Ivanka?\" referring to Trump's designer daughter. \nDuring a fun moment in the ceremony, Kimmel surprised visitors on a tour bus unaware that they were entering the ceremony live on television. Starstruck with the crowd filled with Hollywood stars, Kimmel jokingly pointed out the actress: \"There's Meryl Streep... overrated.\" \nIn another one of his comments, Kimmel mentioned to the audience that Trump had failed to tweet anything about the ceremony. Trying to spark a tweet from the president, Kimmel tweeted \"#merylsayshi,\" with an approving Streep. — Jimmy Kimmel (@jimmykimmel) February 27, 2017 \nThis year's Academy Awards marked Streep's 20th Oscar nomination, breaking her own record for most nominations of all time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T10:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T07:44:56.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
