Search the full dataset. \nMr Turnbull also spoke on the need for donation reform, signalling the potential for change in the rules governing foreign contributions. \n\"Overseas events, as well as those here in Australia, have shown us that the Australian people must be confident that our electoral process is free from foreign intervention or interference,\" he said. \n\"The joint standing committee on electoral matters is examining this complex issue, but I believe Australians expect us to ensure that only Australians, and Australian businesses, can seek to influence Australian elections.\" \nChinese donors have contributed millions to both major political parties since 2013, including $715,000 to the Liberal Party in the past financial year from Hong Kong Kingston Investment Co. Ltd, headed by Chau Chak Wing. \nMr Chau is linked to a partly state-backed newspaper, the Australian New Express Daily, launched by then NSW premier Bob Carr in 2004. \nHe is also president of the Association of Australia China Friendship and Exchange. \nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten also called for reform today, saying he does not want foreign donations \"distorting Australian politics\". Australia's political donation system has been likened to the operation of criminal money laundering with one key difference — the political donation system is entirely legal. \nMr Shorten also criticised the Prime Minister for the delay in publicising any potential donations. \n\"I don't understand why Malcolm Turnbull thinks it should be a secret how much he gave to the Liberal Party,\" he said. \n\"He's going to have to tell someone, at some pint it's going to be public... It sounds tricky, it looks shifty.\" \nMr Shorten added that Labor politicians paid a proportion of their salary to the party. \nThe latest AEC figures show that the Liberal Party received almost $15 million in donations throughout 2015-16, up from about $10.3 million the previous year. \nThe Labor Party received more than $10.3 million in donations, up from $7.3 million in 2014-15.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T10:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T05:36:36.206+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
