Most Popular By Avery Thompson Feb 27, 2017 Scientists from the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid have built a printer that can print fully functional human skin . Bioprinting is rapidly becoming a hot new technology in the world of medicine. The core idea is to build machines that can custom-print body parts, primarily to transplant them into patients. Printing custom tissues using a patient's own cells would prevent rejection and eliminate the need for wait lists and organ donors.   But bioprinting is still in its infancy , and while the tools to print small tissue samples do exist , it will be a long time before whole organs can be manufactured. Now, though, one group of scientists in Spain have built a machine that can print human skin , a major step forward for this nascent technology. Most Popular The printer works like an ordinary office laser printer, except instead of colored ink cartridges it uses \"bio-ink\" with components like proteins and fats. These components are controlled by a computer that prints them in the correct order and proportions to create the skin. The bioprinter can print about 30 square inches of skin per hour, much faster than the few weeks typical of current skin-growing techniques. This technology could be used in the near future to rapidly grow skin grafts for burn victims or cancer patients. The researchers are also trying to adapt their bioprinter to print other organs as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T01:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:52:42.864+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
