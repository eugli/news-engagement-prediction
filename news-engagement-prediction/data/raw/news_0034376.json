Has Kushal Tandon put ex-Gauhar Khan in legal trouble? Kushal Tandon recently posted a picture of Gauhar Khan which has put her into trouble. By Maggie Davis | Published: February 15, 2017 9:08 AM IST Comments Kushal Tandon and Gauhar Khan The love saga of Bigg Boss season 7 contestants Gauhar Khan and Kushal Tandon is known to everyone. But their mushy affair didn’t last for long. While being on the show they’ve had some ugly fights. Even after stepping out their romance continued but it wasn’t a sweet one. They have had bitter moments and finally they called off their relationship. There have been times when the two have argued even on social media platform. But very recently Kushal posted a picture of his ex-flame Gauhar in which she was seen on a cover of a popular magazine. The picture of Gauhar Khan caught everyone’s attention because Kushal Tandon had shared it with a caption that left many stunned. It was never expected that he would ever speak about the leggy lass such amazing stuff. While sharing the picture he wrote, “@haiderkhanhaider saw this picture … click by my brother Haider khan ….. could not risisset my self to share this picture of this stunner …. @gauaharkhan lady with grace , panache, ooomp and style with a golden heart ……” Take a look at the picture below: A post shared by Kushal Tandon (@therealkushaltandon) on Feb 12, 2017 at 10:13am PST \nThe problem wasn’t with the caption but with the name of the magazine which was on the cover, Stardust. As per the photo, Gauhar Khan has been featured on the cover of the popular film magazine and the picture has been shot by Haider Khan. The happy woman replied to Kushal on Instagram, “I l ve this pic !!! @haiderkhanhaider youve always captured me amazingly…. Thank you!!!! N thank you @therealkushaltandon for not just posting this pic but for the kind words !!! You shine on !!!! #gratitude @stardustmagz”. (ALSO READ: WHOA! Kushal Tandon is majorly CRUSHING on Gauahar Khan’s latest picture ) \nBut the reality is, Gauhar Khan has never shot for the cover picture. As soon as Stardust Magazine saw this, they released an official statement, reports ABP. \nDear Media, \nStardust would like to clarify that the post of Gauahar Khan on Instagram with the Stardust masthead has nothing to do with us. AJAY DEVGN is gracing the cover of Stardust February issue. We have come across a few articles which state that Gauahar is on the cover, so we would like to clear the air by saying that the news is false. \nGauahar was also contacted for the same by us and unfortunately she cannot delete the post as she thinks the media will make news of the same and again question her reconciliation with Kushal Tandon. \nAnd Legal action will be taken against the one who has used the masthead without our permission, thus defying our Company Policy. \nRegards, \nTeam Stardust \nOops! Now that’s a big time trouble for Gauhar Khan. But TellyChakkar quoted a source saying, “Gauahar did shoot for the magazine and gave an interview. However, it was not for the cover. Some fan of hers designed the picture and Kushal shared it. This is a matter of miscommunication and we feel it should be talked out not discussed in the media.” Here is one of the picture from the photo shoot: (ALSO READ: CONFIRMED!
