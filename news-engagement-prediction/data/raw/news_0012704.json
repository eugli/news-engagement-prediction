The performance was arranged by “Hamilton” arranger and musical director Alex Lacamoire. “America the Beautiful” was penned in the 1890s by Samuel Ward. AND THAT'S @LacketyLac on the arrangement, y'all. #AndSisterhood \n— Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) February 5, 2017 Thanks papa! \n— Alex Lacamoire (@LacketyLac) February 5, 2017 \nGoldsberry won a Tony for her performance as Angelica Schuyler in the show. Soo played the pivotal character of Eliza Schuyler, Alexander Hamilton’s faithful wife. Jones played the third Schuyler sister, Peggy.
