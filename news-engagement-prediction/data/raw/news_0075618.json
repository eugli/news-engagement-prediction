This beach cleanup programme is one of our corporate social responsibility projects,” he said on Saturday. \nThemed ‘Less Pollution is The Best Solution’, the programme was aimed at raising awareness on environmental conservation and waste segregation. \nAfter the cleanup, the team took over the now spotless beach and played games. This was followed by a talk on waste segregation by the Penang Green Council. \n“We hope the participants can learn something through this event and bring back good values of caring for the environment to share with their families and friends,” said Shafiq. \nInari Technology specialises in making multi-chips and multi-die hybrids as well as packaging of radio frequency products.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T03:32:02.239+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
