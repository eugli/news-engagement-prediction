I will be doing injustice to her if I form an image of her already. It will get complicated. The only thing that will matter is love. As long as she loves me and I love her, all will be fine.” \nIn recent times, web series have gained popularity amongst the younger generation. Youngsters prefer binge watching a web series over a long-running daily soap. In such a scenario does he feel web series are a threat to television shows? “Web series are a way forward.

It might not overpower television, but yes it will be a very big market in the near future,” replied Siddharth. \nCheck out the pictures from Dil Se Dil Tak’s Delhi promotions. \nAlso read | I apologised to Siddharth Shukla on first day of Dil Se Dil Tak: Rashami Desai \nTalking about Badrinath Ki Dulhania which happens to be the second in the Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania franchise, in which Siddharth played a pivotal role, the actor says, “I wish the film does really well.
