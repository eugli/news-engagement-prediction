The Women’s League had been one of the structures guilty of defying the ANC leadership on the matter. Its president, Bathabile Dlamini, did so yet again. \n“The NWC said we shouldn’t discuss this until the succession debate has been opened, but here we are supporting a very humble person,” said Dlamini. \nShe also compared Dlamini-Zuma to Jesus \n“She is also a lion and a lamb,” said the ANCWL president. \nThe marathon church service was held under the theme women in power, but for the most part it resembled a rally with the pastor at the church Pastor Velaphi Ndebende throwing his weight behind Dlamini-Zuma to take over the reigns as ANC president. \nPresident Jacob Zuma, who is set to step down after finishing off two terms at the helm in December, has also publicly supported calls for a woman to take over from him. \n“I am taking this women in leadership [talk] across the country and by December it will be boiling,” Ndebende told cheering crowds. \nThe Women’s League has already made a pronouncement that Dlamini-Zuma is its preferred candidate for the ANC presidency, and it’s believed some of the guests at the event shared a similar stance. \nMinister Des Van Rooyen, chairperson of the Umkhonto Wesizwe Military Veterans Association Kebby Mapatsoe and MP Humphrey Memezi were among the crowd who sat through several hours of the service in honour of women. \nAlthough Dlamini-Zuma did not say she was ready for the role personally, she shared stories on how women were born to lead and examples of her own approach to leadership. \n“Women are practical, they want to see things done. I always say to people that I worked with, I will never punish you if you make a mistake working,” she said. \nCorruption can’t tolerated \nDlamini-Zuma said corruption was not only robbing people, but also eroding the trust they had in the government. \n‘You can’t use government money or church money to enrich yourself,” she said. \nShe said it was also corrupt to earn a salary but not do the work one is mandated to do. \nThe former AU Commission chair who’s hardly said much on the state of South Africa and its politics over the years, said South Africans were looking for a responsive government. \n“You can’t be responsive if you don’t want to work,” she said. \nDlamini-Zuma also shared her thoughts on a long-standing debate about the future of the country as far as energy is concerned. \n“We mustn’t listen to those who say we must only use renewable energy,” said Dlamini Zuma. \nNo developed country uses only renewable energy, there must be a mix she said.
