We’ve followed up on the trend and we scorn at the gimmicks that celebrate “the day of love.” Only too often have I heard individuals say it’s bullshit and yet others prepare for it like a birthday, or festival. But, what does it really mean to us, in the deepest core of our being? © Unsplash \nI decided to take the question to the masses and got these individuals to tell me what they really think. So, what does Valentine’s Day really mean to us? \n1. Nivedita Sharma, Journalist, IANS \n“To me, it’s basically an off day I spend at home, alone with my partner. It means alone time with the one person I really want to \nbe alone with.” \n2. Somak Adhikari, Senior Officer, Indiatimes \n“A day just like any other, ‘cause if you’re single it makes no difference and if you’re not, then no one day is needed to remind you of that.” \n3. Faizan Patel, Blogger & Photographer \n“It’s a marketing gimmick by Archies and Cadbury’s… and mothers-in-law!” \n4. Varun Pratap, PR & Marketing Professional \n“… And Hallmarks…” \n5. Pallavi Chaturvedi, Blogger \n“I got introduced to Valentine's Day through Archies, the comics. And as a tiny 5-year-old I made my Mom a card for it. Since then, the day has always been about love for me. But, all kinds of love. I remember each and every person I love and connect with them, reminding myself about exactly why they matter. Oh, and a day to bake something for my family; no gifts, store-bought cards, dinners or anything commercial though. Now, as a blogger, it's also about curating lists of things you can do without spending a bomb. :)” \n6. Dhatri Bhatt, Head of Communications, H&M \n“It’s the day I wear pink, simple.” © Unsplash \n7. Chandni Mahajan, PR Professional \n“Honestly, it is just another day. If I want to do something special, then I will do it, no matter what, but it need not be Valentine's day. It shouldn't be a forced celebration, is my point. As kids, my brother and I used to go out to check out love birds and make fun of them… hehehe…” \n8. Aakanksha Bhutani, PR & Marketing Head \n“Valentine's Day gives me a reason to spread my creative wings and step ahead of the cliché heart and flower game and create something more personalized; maybe a customized illustrated chocolate bar, or a scarf with initials.” \n9. Sakshi Gandhi, Brand Consultant \n“For me, every day is a day of love. I feel we should make our partner feel special every day and it should not be confined to just one day. It has now become a festival in Delhi; the restaurants run special promotions, brands launch special collection, etc. So, I like to revel in the celebrations as it feels good to go with the flow.” \n10. Vishal Bhalla, PR Professional \n“For me, it’s just a regular day. If you love someone, there is no specific day, or time to express your feelings to your partner; whether it’s valentine, or rose, or chocolate day. It can be celebrated any day and anytime if you really mean it.” \n11. Varun Ravindranath Rana, Editor, Luxpresso \n“Valentine's Day to me is a fond childhood memory...exciting because it was a little clandestine, slightly forbidden. It's sad that today everything has taken on a political flavour, robbing the innocent joy out of a harmless idea like a special day to celebrate love (any kind of love, as Valentine's is not restricted to girlfriends and boyfriends). Of course, I know that it's a huge commercial gimmick perpetrated by the Capitalists! But in celebrating St. Valentine's Day, we needn't fall into that trap. Neither do we have to keep proving our nationalism or Hinduism by actively shunning it. For my part, I feel any day can be Valentine's Day. Ascribing a date to it just makes it a little special for people who don't think like I do, which I can respect. And hey, setting aside the commercial angle which everyone should be wary of anyway, what's wrong with celebrating love for a day in a world that seems increasingly fueled by hate?” \nThat, right there, is literally all my thoughts and emotions rolled into 11 individual viewpoints! And, on that note, wish you all a very Happy Valentine’s Day. I’m going to go buy the street dogs some presents, now. \nPhoto: © Unsplash (Main Image)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T16:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T06:20:18.316+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
