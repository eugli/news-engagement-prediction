(Doreen Christensen/SunSentinel) Doreen Christensen ranks No. 3 in reputation rankings of the top 100 most visible companies in a new consumer survey by the Harris Poll.\nThe Lakeland-based grocer comes in with an 82.78, ranking out of 100, just below Amazon and Wegmans grocery chain.

Forbes and Fortune magazines sing its praises year after year, listing Publix in multiple most-admired and best-of lists. J.D. Power & Associates has ranked Publix pharmacy tops for five consecutive years, too. \nConversely, on the back end of Most Visible list were Comcast at No. 90, Volkswagen at 91, Sears at 94, Bank of America at 95, Wells Fargo at 99 and Takata at 100. \nThat was the case last year when I got a bunch of $10 Publix gift cards by using the supermarket chain's year-long Stocking Spree loyalty program. \nIt's back again, and I can't wait to play my little game to see how many freebies... \nI get a little thrill each time something free arrives in my mailbox. \nThat was the case last year when I got a bunch of $10 Publix gift cards by using the supermarket chain's year-long Stocking Spree loyalty program. \nIt's back again, and I can't wait to play my little game to see how many freebies...

A positive reputation can provide competitive advantages and help your company achieve its objectives while a poor one can obstruct your ability to execute against your business plan.\" \nPublix celebrated its 85th anniversary in 2015. Ever since founder George Jenkins opened his first grocery store in Winter Haven in 1930, it's been a love fest. Great customer service, BOGO sales, competitor coupons, free cookies and oral antibiotics are just a few reasons customers take pleasure in shopping at Publix. \n(Doreen Christensen) \nAccording to Harris, the biggest risks to corporate reputation include lying, misrepresenting facts about a product or service, illegal actions or intentional wrongdoing by corporate leaders, according to Harris. These findings are reflected in the rankings, where embarrassing scandals by airbag-maker Takata, German automaker Volkswagon and banking giant Well Fargo forced those companies to the bottom of the list. \nMeanwhile, Amazon is celebrating its No. 1 status with a86.2 ranking by offering $8.62 off orders of $50 or more on Feb. 22 with coupon code BIGTHANKS.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:32:03.347+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
