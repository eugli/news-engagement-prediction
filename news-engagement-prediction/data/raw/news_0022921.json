The Atlanta office, which covers three states, arrested 200 people, Bryan Cox, a spokesman for the office, said. The 161 arrests in the Los Angeles area were made in a region that included seven highly populated counties, Marin said. \nMarin called the five-day operation an “enforcement surge.” \nIn a conference call with reporters, he said that such actions were routine, pointing to one last summer in Los Angeles under former President Barack Obama. \n“The rash of these recent reports about ICE checkpoints and random sweeps, that’s all false and that’s dangerous and irresponsible,” Marin said. “Reports like that create a panic.” \nHe said that of the people arrested in Southern California, only 10 did not have criminal records. Of those, five had prior deportation orders. \nREAD MORE: Are Donald Trump’s policies fuelling racism in Canada? \nWATCH: Calgarians demonstrate against Trump immigration ban Saturday \nMichael Kagan, a professor of immigration law at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, said immigration advocates are concerned that the arrests could signal the beginning of more aggressive enforcement and increased deportations under Trump. \n“It sounds as if the majority are people who would have been priorities under Obama as well,” Kagan said in a telephone interview. “But the others may indicate the first edge of a new wave of arrests and deportations.” \nTrump recently broadened the categories of people who could be targeted for immigration enforcement to anyone who had been charged with a crime, removing an Obama-era exception for people convicted of traffic misdemeanors, Kagan said. © 2017 Thomson Reuters ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T04:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T09:11:23.438+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
