But since being given a recumbent tricycle in 2014, he has devoted much of his spare time in the saddle.\nWhen he is not on the road, training for a long-distance ride, Justin can usually be found pedalling his bike in the foyer of a supermarket or a Moto service station somewhere in the North East, with a collecting bucket for donations by his side.\nWhen he's not in the saddle, the father of two works as a part-time receptionist at Help for Heroes northern Recovery Centre, Phoenix House in Catterick.\nIt was there that the Charity’s Director of Fundraising, Alistair Lockhart, surprised Justin with a certificate to mark his dedication to the cause in front of a gathering of staff, who showed their admiration of his efforts with a rousing round of applause.\nMr Lockhart said that, as a keen user of Twitter, he had followed Justin’s fundraising exploits since the start.\nI am a big Justin fan so I was honoured to meet and thank him personally.\nI also wanted to acknowledge his family and friends who support him and enable him to do such a huge amount of fundraising.\nJustin is not just a fundraiser though, he is a beneficiary who has chosen to do this for the charity in recognition of the support he received - and that is the ultimate endorsement of everything we do!”\n– Alistair Lockhart, Charity’s Director of Fundraising Justin Henderson, seen here on the left, admits to having hated cycling when he was in the army. Credit: Help for Heroes 6 days As part of a cycling tour of regional war memorials, Justing cycled from Seaham to Ripon in 6 days. Justin, who comes from York but now lives in Colburn, was given a recumbent trike in 2014 by a fellow beneficiary to enable him to take part in a cycling tour of regional war memorials – from Seaham to Ripon in six days.\nHe has hardly stopped cycling since.\nIn 2015, he took part in the Catterick to Windsor Hero Ride; the following year he was given a place on the Help for Heroes Big Battlefield Bike Ride, for which the Charity grant-funded him a new, specially-measured, trike.\nThat was the greatest gift anyone could have given me and being able to take part in the BBBR the biggest honour.\nYet when I had to cycle six miles every day as a Royal Logistics Corps postal courier, I hated every inch of it!”\n– Justin Henderson, North Yorkshire veteran A freak accident while stationed in Germany left Justin with a broken back and limited mobility and he was medically discharged. His fractured L5 vertebra was been replaced with a prosthetic vertebra and has to manage constant pain.\nI struggled to imagine what life beyond the military would entail but Help for Heroes opened many doors for me and that’s why I do what I do.\nThe recognition from the Charity came out of the blue and means a lot, but I don’t fundraise for recognition: I do it because I want to.\n– Justin Henderson, North Yorkshire veteran The modest 41-year- old praised his wife Sam for her constant support.\nWe say that Help for Heroes is about the blokes but it is also about the unsung heroes. Those who support us, help us and stick by us.\nSam is my rock and my best friend.\nMy hero!”\n– Justin Henderson, North Yorkshire veteran Justin is set to return to the battlefields of France, Belgium and the Netherlands for this year’s 350-mile Hero Ride from Lille to Arnhem.
