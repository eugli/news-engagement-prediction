Pin \nAt Spectra Fashions, Sally wears a leopard print dress and hugs Shirley in anticipation of their preview. Shirley worries they’ll sink or swim based on one man’s review. Sally says all they have to do is impress Jarrett. They go over the plan to show the designs simply in the office since they don’t have the money to fix up the showroom. Sally is certain everyone is going to take notice, including Queen Steffy. As the models get ready, Sally gives her team a pep talk. \nRelated: Soap alum Jesse Metcalfe’s Chesapeake Shores renewed on Hallmark Channel \nIn Bill’s office, Jarrett resists attending the Spectra preview.

She assures him being his sister will always be most important to her. Talk turns to it being a big day for Thomas’ favorite redhead. Steffy’s sure it will be a hot mess. They debate about whether Sally will achieve any success. Thomas argues that Sally’s dedicated, and Steffy muses that’s no good if there’s no talent to back it up. Thomas thinks the talent will come to her. Steffy laughs at the idea that Sally could become competition, and argues the point that Sally is just like her aunt given the stunts she’s pulled. \nRelated: OLTL alum David Gregory’s Happy Anniversary project \nJarrett arrives at Spectra Fashions, where Sally fawns over him – her aunt said he was the best of the best. Jarrett is surprised given their history. Sally introduces him to her team and says the exclusive preview will be held in the office so as to be ‘up close and personal’. When the models are ready, Sally has Darlita cue the music and the show begins with a bold red gown followed by two other quirky designs and a bright yellow showstopper. Jarrett pronounces the designs unique in a good way. Sally hopes to see that opinion reflected in his review. Jarrett sighs deeply as she tells him they need a push from someone as esteemed as he is in the industry. Jarrett downplays his influence and exits hastily. Sally looks perturbed, but delivers another pep talk. Thomas calls and she tells him the preview went fabulous – she’ll be making headlines tomorrow. \nIn Bill’s office, Jarrett reveals that the preview wasn’t that terrible – much to his surprise, Sally’s designs were interesting. Bill won’t have him writing a fair, honest review – it must be scathing and career-ending. “We are putting Spectra out of business.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:39:45.152+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
