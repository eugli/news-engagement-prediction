Slot to Green Bay Packers Newsletter Newsletter \nMelvin Ingram had a rough start to his NFL career. \nIn his rookie season, he played in all 16 games and recorded only one sack in two starts. The following season, Ingram only played in four games because he tore his ACL. \nIt wasn't until 2015 when Ingram really started to get attention from the NFL. He started in all 16 games and recorded 65 tackles, 10.5 sacks and three forced fumbles. He was able to comeback in 2016 to start in all 16 games and record eight sacks for the Chargers. \nThe Packers are now in the offseason and there’s a lot of work to be done to get ready for next season.

Here's a closer look at Ingram. \n2016 stats : 60 tackles, eight sacks, five passes defended, five forced fumbles \nThis play might make Melvin Ingram my top free agent target for the Dolphins. Only rare athletes can manhandle a LT like this. pic.twitter.com/Hn9FduML6M — Omar Kelly (@OmarKelly) February 21, 2017 \nPro Football Focus named Ingram as it's best free agent edge rusher . Here's what PFF had to say about Ingram. \nOver the first few years of his career, Ingram was not a game-changer that the Chargers had hoped he would be after selecting him in the first round of the 2012 draft. It’s taken him a while but the last two years he has significantly improved his game as a full-time player. Ingram was tied for the third-most total pressures among edge defenders in 2016 with 72, the same amount he tallied in his first three seasons combined. The biggest area of improvement this past year was his run defense, where he had a career-high 19 run stops after previously grading as marginally above-average during his first four seasons. That combination led to him earning the sixth-highest overall grade among edge defenders in 2016. He’s primarily played at outside linebacker for the Chargers and would fit best in a similar system. Ingram will be age 28 when the 2017 season kicks off. His relatively young age and performance trending upward the past two years give him the edge for the top spot in this year’s free agent class. \nIf the Packers re-sign Nick Perry, then the team will have their two starting outside linebackers in Perry and Clay Matthews . However, Ingram is too good of a free agent to pass up and if the Packers want him, they could sign him and move Matthews to inside linebacker. \nThat might not what the Packers want to do with Matthews, but Ingram and Perry would make a formidable pass rush duo and that is something the defense needs if the Packers want to improve.
