Photo: Ray Tamarra \nLike leggings before them, sweatpants have infiltrated the wardrobe rotation and Instagram accounts of a new generation of influencers, like Kendall Jenner , thanks, in part, to fashion house Vetements that has made its mark by repurposing streetwear and loungewear into luxury items. \nJenner was spotted in a white Champion tracksuit last month by the Paris-based collective team that cost about $2000. The look, usually seen on amateur footballers on their annual footy trip to Shepparton, has since sold out. \nVetements is also partly responsible for the rebirth of Juicy Couture, a Californian label made famous by Paris Hilton in her heyday for terry towelling twin-sets. The company closed its stores in 2014. Now thanks to a Vetements collaboration it's back like herpes and available at Urban Outfitters . \nVogue cautions of this development: \"Please invest wisely this February.\" \nBut considering everything Noughties is back, albeit with an expensive, celebrity endorsed twist, try the trackie trend with sneakers, with heels and even with fishnet tights underneath, because, you may find, as Hilton once sang, \"the stars are blind...but maybe I'm perfect for you\".
