(Vogue Theatre/Facebook)\nThe 320-seat theatre now hosts popular musical acts, local theatre, Theatre New Brunswick productions, documentaries, comedy shows and more.\nA recently formed board of directors will help promote the venue. Somers admits it's taken time to make some realize the theatre can operate as both a church and theatre.\n\"We really are here to promote the city and to help Miramichi be a healthy community and a vibrant community as well with lots of culture.\"\nSomers says there were times during the renovation when he questioned if he'd made the right choice to buy it and pull the project off.\nGiving back A small group worked to keep the 1950s feel but had to completely refurbish the 4,000-square foot auditorium with new flooring, new seating, a fresh coat of paint and more. Somers said all the work was done by volunteers and donations.\nSomers deliberately left some things untouched and says he enjoys seeing the reactions when people visit the Vogue again for the first time.\n\"They notice it is very much like the way they remember it,\" said Somers.\nThat includes a broken clock on the wall the previous owner had never fixed.\nVictor Somers is not only a pastor, but does many jobs for his church including being a barista in the Creative Grounds Café. (Creative Grounds Cafe/Faceboook)\n\"I didn't touch it, I left it there. It's still stuck at quarter to seven,\" said Somers.\nAcross the street, they've opened the Creative Grounds Café in the front section of a sprawling 19,000-square foot building.\nOther parts of the building are being used by a community arts school, dance school, mixed martial arts school and more.\nSomers has more ideas to make use of the remaining space and ways to continue to include the community.\n\"I am taking what I know and what I do to help build the community back up,\" he said.\nEastSide Church has given life to two vacant buildings on Miramichi's east side of the city in the former town of Chatham.
