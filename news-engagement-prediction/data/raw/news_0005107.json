Story continues below \nThe new partnership will allow the VPD to have access to MedicAlert’s client information and provide valuable health-related details to first responders in Vancouver, which includes photos, possible medical conditions, and any triggers the person may have. \n“Information provided to the officers will potentially speed up the process of locating people who are lost,” Palmer said. ” We can return them to their families as quickly as possible.” \nMedicAlert CEO Robert Ridge echoed Palmer’s comments saying he finds it important to give police 24/7 access to information that will help officers and the bracelets add an extra layer of protection. \n“[This] benefits citizens who are prone to walking away from their environment,” Ridge said. “Our MedicAlert subscribers will have an extra layer of protection.” \nPalmer also announced the VPD will sponsor the first 100 new MedicAlert subscribers, which includes their first-year service plan and MedicAlert ID bracelet for free, at the Pacific Autism Family Centre on Feb. 1 and Oakridge Mall on Feb. 2. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
