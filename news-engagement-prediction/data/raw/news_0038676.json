Adam Sacasa Privacy Policy \nThe violent crash that killed Broward Sheriff ’s deputy Ryan Seguin remains seared in the memory of his partner. \nIt happened during a traffic stop in 2006, 11 years to the day Wednesday when Seguin and his partner, deputy Kari Pallotto, had pulled a car over on Interstate 595 in Davie. \nAs they worked, a driver swerved to avoid a stopped car and instead hit Seguin and Palloto. Palloto was briefly knocked unconscious, but Seguin, a four time deputy of the month in Weston and recipient of a life-saving award for rescuing a child from drowning, died instantly. He was 23. \nIt’s a tragedy first responders and others who work along Florida’s roadways are trying to prevent by highlighting the state’s Move-Over Law. They held a news conference Wednesday at the Deerfield Beach Fire Rescue Station #102. \n“I look back on that every day of my life, and I can see that image. I don’t wish that upon anybody,” Palloto said of the crash. “That’s why we’re here, encouraging and educating the citizens to please move over, slow down, and yield to any vehicles, not just the emergency vehicles on the side of the road.” \nThe law requires drivers to move over a lane from where first responders, tow trucks or garbage trucks are stopped. If a driver can’t move over, drivers have to drop 20 mph below the speed limit or go 5 mph in areas with a 20 mph or less speed limit. \nThe law is particularly important in Broward and Palm Beach counties, which rank one and two respectively in the number of move-over related injuries across the state in 2016, according to Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles records. \nThe records show the number of crashes across the state have been steadily increasing over the past several years from 136 crashes in 2013 to 204 in 2016. \nFlorida Highway Patrol Trooper Mac Mickens said that distracted drivers are a reason for the rise and that the flashing lights on his car aren’t hard to see. \n“You see people and they say, ‘Well, I didn’t see your car. Well I didn’t have time to move over.’ You can see that car anywhere from one and a half to two miles before you get to it,” Mickens said. “If you can’t change lanes in one and a half to two miles, you probably shouldn’t be driving in the first place.” \nA driver following the law would have stopped Mickens from being hit after pulling over a car on Oct. 18, 2015, around 3 a.m. for driving 101 mph. \nAfter getting the driver’s license and registration, he was walking back to his car when he was caught in the path of headlights. \n“I threw both hands in the air and said, ‘This is it,’” Mickens said. “Next thing I knew, I was getting up from in front of my car.” \nHe tried to stand using his left leg but when he tried to use the other, he crumbled to the ground with a fractured bones in his right knee and pelvis, he said. \n“The guy that hit me, his blood alcohol level was a 0.182,” well above the legal limit of 0.08. “He had no license and he had been deported twice and had gotten back into the U.S,” Mickens said. \nThe driver would serve a five-year prison sentence. For Mickens, it took 11 months of rehab before he was working again. \n“For me to be here, I can’t even describe how I feel to be here,” he said. “In 30 years, you get comfortable but you still know the danger.” \nAlong with first responders, service vehicles like tow trucks or garbage trucks apply to the law, too. \nIt’s something Jim Jennings, owner of Emerald towing, wishes more people knew. One of Jennings’ drivers, Joseph Ricciardelli, died Jan. 2, 2012, while towing a car from a crime scene. \nA driver slammed on his brakes for stopped traffic and drifted into Ricciardelli. \n“People just don’t realize. They move over for police officers and fire trucks, but they don’t realize towing and road rangers are also part of the same law,” Jennings said. \nDrivers violating the law will face a $165 dollar fine in Broward County and $166 fine in Palm Beach County.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:57:21.371+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
