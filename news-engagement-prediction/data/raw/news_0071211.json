Today payments company Square announced earnings, beating the street with a narrower loss than expected — $0.04 per share — on revenues of $452 million for the fourth quarter 2016. \nThose results were a vast improvement over last year’s fourth quarter, when the company lost $0.34 per share on revenues of $374.4 million. It was also better than Wall Street’s forecast a $0.09 loss per share on revenues of $450 million for the quarter. \nThose earnings come off of gross payment volume of $13.7 billion, which was up 34 percent from the prior year. Its business loan business also continues to grow, as Square faciliated more than 40,000 business loans totaling $248 million, an increase of 68 percent over the year-ago quarter. Hardware sales, which are the smallest portion of its revenue mix, grew to $8.9 million as more vendors continue to upgrade to contactless and chip-card readers. \n(Updating…) Featured Image: Scott Olson/Getty Images 0 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:18:21.830+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
