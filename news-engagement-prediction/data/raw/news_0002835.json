We are disappointed that she has chosen to leave, but we wish her all the best.\" The news comes less than a week after sources at NBC told ET that Megyn Kelly's new daytime show would take over either Today's 9 a.m. or 10 a.m. hour, and that the NBC morning show decided to get rid of Al Roker and Hall's \"Today's Take\" hour -- which currently airs at 9 a.m. -- in the process. Hall joined MSNBC and NBC in 2007, and joined the Today team in 2014. \"She has also worked passionately to bring awareness to domestic violence, highlighting the issue on her show 'Deadline Crime, with Tamron Hall,'\" the statement continued. \"She earned an Edward R. Murrow Award for a story that aired on NBC News, and an Emmy in 2010 as a member of NBC News’ live inauguration coverage.\" \nWATCH: WATCH: Megyn Kelly Congratulates Tucker Carlson on Replacing Her At Fox News -- 'I Will Be Cheering Him On' \nDespite Hall's exit, NBC News confirmed that Roker will continue to host \"Today’s Take\" until a new morning lineup begins in the fall of 2017. The network also released the following statement on behalf of Hall, \"The last ten years have been beyond anything I could have imagined, and I’m grateful. I’m also very excited about the next chapter. To all my great colleagues, I will miss you and I will be rooting for you.\" -- Additional reporting by Amy Purnell RELATED SLIDESHOW", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T04:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:14:27.272+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
