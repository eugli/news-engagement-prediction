(AMA/Getty Images) \nArsene Wenger has hit back after being accused of needlessly risking Alexis Sanchez in Arsenal’s victory over Sutton United in the FA Cup. \nWenger opted to bring the Chilean on as a second-half substitute with just 16 minutes remaining, despite the Gunners having a two-goal lead through Lucas Perez and Theo Walcott. \nBefore the match, Danny Welbeck had already pulled out of the game due to the plastic surface, but Wenger insists Sanchez was able to cope with the demands of the pitch. \n‘He is a guy who has a strong body,’ said Wenger. Sanchez replaced Alex Iwobi with 16 minutes to go. (Getty Images) Sanchez didn’t suffer an injury against the non-league club.
