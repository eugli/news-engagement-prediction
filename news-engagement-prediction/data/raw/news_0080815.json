(I have win 10 64 bit pro) I ask because I keep getting an automatic driver downloaded which causes problems with my computer. I have deleted this new driver 16 times and reinstalled the old video driver and for a day or two my computer works perfectly bur despite having taken all actions to stop automatic downloads up it pops again. Sorry for burdening you with this sob story but I am beginning to lose the will to live. LOL Does this software give us a chance to stop automatic downloads.

They cannot be upgraded without purchasing new license most of the software does have option to check for updates. So what actually the software is useful for? why would someone want to have spying software? the manufacturer of the software knows what software you are using. most of the software from GAOTD if updated/upgraded it may not work.

Reply | Comment by infi – Last hour – Did you find this comment useful? yes | no (-1) #5 This is actually wonderful software that I've been using for years for keeping all my application software up-to-date. In my case, it examines 146 programs on my Windows 10 PC and lets me know when there is an updated version of each. I was amazed, for example, when it told me that my installed TurboTax needed updating (this is tax season). Sometimes (as when it's a Giveaway of the Day program) I don't want to update it. For these situations it gives me the option to skip this update \"For ever\", \"For 1 day\", \"For 1 week\", \"For 1 month\". Since I've been using the free version, I do NOT have the capability of using their installs for updated versions. I assume this version is the paid version and you would have that capability. I then have to update the software on my own. I've been doing that by typically using the sometimes builtin update capability (i.e. TurboTax) of each application needing an update or by downloading the program at the author's website. I've never found ANY application update software anywhere near as complete as Sumo and I've tried many such as Ninite, Milouz Market, and FileHippo App Manager.

Reply | Comment by Rolo – 2 hours ago – Did you find this comment useful? yes | no (-3) #3 Sorry! Seems the basic idea with SUMo was born dead. This crappy thing takes you to do the downloads to do all the work yourself, instead of handling the process for you. This is just a \"let me tell you what to do and how to spend your time\" -program, very unnecessary as such and a VERY big disappointment. An example: SUMo says my Shockwave for Internet Explorer is outdated. When the download link is clicked, it takes you to the BASE -page of Adobe - www.adobe.com (this is an outrage!) and just steals your time (read \"life\") here too. How could anyone in their right mind recommend this to anyone, and lose their own credibility for trusting \"this\"? Yack. At least it should know exactly what browser it is looking to update the plugin/addon for and go directly to that file, but even that would only be second best - when quietly managing the whole process would be the feature to look for. There are better solutions even free now and then here on GAOTD. Sorry! Seems the basic idea with SUMo was born dead.
