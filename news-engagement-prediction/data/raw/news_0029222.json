He’s the point of contact for many of these foreign visits. If you look at the schedule, we had the prime minister of Canada Justin Trudeau here. Obviously for bilateral meetings. On Wednesday, we’re welcoming Benjamin Netanyahu here. Behind the scenes, where they’re talking about trade, they’re talking about terrorism, security, the fact that Canada and the U.S. are very important, neighbors to each other and will continue to be. And obviously, the national security advisor is a very important point person in those discussions. General Flynn has said he can’t recall. And that he had about 30 phone calls with, I guess leaders at the time. And since then, 70 I’m told, with different leaders, and I’ll just leave his comments at that.”\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor\n KellyAnne Conway , mike flynn , MSNBC , Steve Kornaki", "external_links": ["http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/facebook/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fvideo%2F2017%2F02%2F13%2Fkellyanne-conway-general-flynn-enjoys-full-confidence-president%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Kellyanne+Conway%3A+General+Flynn+Enjoys+the+%E2%80%98Full+Confidence+of+the+President%E2%80%99", "http://twitter.com/jeff_poor", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/google_plusone_share/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fvideo%2F2017%2F02%2F13%2Fkellyanne-conway-general-flynn-enjoys-full-confidence-president%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Kellyanne+Conway%3A+General+Flynn+Enjoys+the+%E2%80%98Full+Confidence+of+the+President%E2%80%99", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/twitter/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fvideo%2F2017%2F02%2F13%2Fkellyanne-conway-general-flynn-enjoys-full-confidence-president%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Kellyanne+Conway%3A+General+Flynn+Enjoys+the+%E2%80%98Full+Confidence+of+the+President%E2%80%99&shortener=bitly"], "published": "2017-02-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:23:41.525+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
