Share Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Get daily   \nManchester United 's EFL Cup final at Wembley against Southampton a week on Sunday could bring home the volatile career graphs of Luke Shaw and Marcus Rashford . \nFor left back Shaw, unless there is a quick turnaround in his fortunes with Reds' boss Jose Mourinho , he is more likely to watch the encounter against his former side in a United club suit in the Wembley stands. \nThe final will be almost three years to the day since he made his full England debut as an 18-year-old as a half-time substitute for Ashley Cole at the stadium in a friendly against Denmark. \nIt would lead to him being in Roy Hodgson's World Cup squad in Brazil. \nFor Rashford the final will be a year and a day since he sensationally marked his United senior breakthrough with two goals in the Europa League win against Midtjylland at Old Trafford as an 18-year-old. Read More Manchester United player Henrikh Mkhitaryan challenged by Jose Mourinho claims Gary Neville \nIt would lead to him being in Hodgson's Euro 2016 squad last summer in France. \nHaving been demoted by Mourinho to enable Anthony Martial to gain some confidence, which prompted a goal for the Frenchman against Watford last Saturday, it is conceivable that the Mancunian striker might not make the starting XI against the Saints. \nHaving been in the FA Cup final line up last May for United against Crystal Palace it would be a body blow for Rashford who has yet to reach the 18 starts this season he managed to cram in from February onwards last term for Louis van Gaal.. \nFor both Shaw and Rashford this is the flip side of the senior coin. Mourinho has rationed Rashford's starts for United this season \nBut they could not have any better examples that Mourinho's tough love produces results than those sitting in their own dressing room. \nHenrikh Mkhitaryan is more senior in years but a Premier League novice who discovered reputation and a Â£26.3m price tag doesn't wash with Mourinho if you are not initially suited for the job in hand. \nHe's emerged from his early season treatment as the influential midfielder United fans thought they'd bought from Borussia Dortmund last summer. \nMartial has also discovered that cost and previous achievements are no guarantee when you have to prove yourself a fit in the United manager's system. Read More \nJust like Mkhitaryan did, Martial could now be emerging from the fog of his personal campaign. \nHe's nailed his colours to the Old Trafford mast and he's answered Mourinho's challenge. \nWembley a week on Sunday might hurt for Shaw and Rashford but if they follow Mkhitaryan and Martial's examples they will come through the pain. \nGet all the latest Manchester United news first with our new app. Download it here now.
