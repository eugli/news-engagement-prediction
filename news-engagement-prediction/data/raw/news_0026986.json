They told me there was no heartbeat.”\nTressa with her daughter, who she gave up for adoption two years after giving birth.

I am so excited about what the future holds and I already love my baby.\n“I cannot wait to meet him or her but when both lines on that pregnancy test showed up, although I was happy, I was desperately sad as well. I had a little cry.”\nTressa said that if she had the opportunity, she would get her baby girl back in a heartbeat.\n“I am so grateful I am finally going to be the mother I have longed to be all these years,” she said.\n“But I don’t ever want my first child to think I abandoned her, or that I am replacing her with this new baby.\n“I’d welcome her back tomorrow with open arms if I could and I hope she knows she will always be a part of our family.\n“But this is the future for me and I can’t keep looking back. The past has made me even more determined to keep this child and give him or her the best possible life.”\nFollowing her daughter’s adoption, Tressa spent the following three years in and out of care homes, and fell into a life of alcohol and drug abuse.\nTressa and her partner Darren are expecting their first child together, following a miscarriage in 2012.

She’ll be 11 in the summer almost the same age I was when I fell pregnant,” she said.\n“It has made me realise just how young I was when all that happened. At the time I didn’t feel like I was that young because I had already been through so much but now, it makes me feel sick. No child should have that happen.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T21:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T05:13:58.280+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
