Picture: Rob Pozo The Express Restaurant reimagines way we enjoy Japanese food with 72-hour ramen and Moreton Bay bug sushi Danielle Buckley, Canterbury-Bankstown Express February 21, 2017 12:40pm Sydney's luckiest puppy 11 year old creates 'domuts' for dogs\nTHE neighbourhood of Kagurazaka, known for its charming cobblestoned roads, preserved geisha houses and fine restaurants, is in central Tokyo.\nIt’s where Takumi Marui spent seven years acquiring the skills to be a counter sushi chef, or itamae.\nIt’s these skills that would later serve thousands of happy customers at Merivale’s Sushi-e in Sydney CBD and later at Katsu Yachiyo in Surry Hills.\nNow these skills have landed on Canterbury Rd.\nTogether with his wife Miki, Mr Marui has opened Bon Japanese in Canter­bury and just quietly it’s putting the Western practice of sushi trains to shame.\nmedia_camera Spider Roll sushi with soft shell crab. Picture: Rob Pozo\nSmall plates like the Moreton Bay bug tempura roll, or the spider roll with soft shell crab roasted green chilli mayo, avocado, cucumber and sesame seed are what keep Bon Japanese ahead of the pack.\nBut it would be a mistake to just come for the sushi.\nThe menu changes seasonally, but some choice picks are the caramelised miso cod, snapper carpaccio or kingfish sashimi.\nmedia_camera Chicken karaage with home made tartare sauce. Picture: Rob Pozo\nAustralian ingredients are fused when it makes sense, and coriander is integrated into the menu, almost unheard of at most Japanese restaurants.\nUnlike sushi trains, everything is made with thought and precision.\n“We don’t do shortcuts,” Ms Marui said.\n“If it gets busy, we can’t just speed up by pressing a button like at McDonald’s.\n“We take the same process.”\nmedia_camera This Torigara Soy Ramen takes two days to make. Picture: Rob Pozo\nThe pork ramen, for example, takes an incredible 72 hours of preparation.\nThe broth is made two days before from scratch while Mr Marui rolls the pork belly and marinates it.\nThe egg is marinated in soy sauce and even the bamboo shoots, called menma, are soaked in water for two days to extract the salt.\nThe chicken karaage also receives a lot of love – marinated in the couple’s own soy seasoning and served with homemade tartare sauce.\nIt’s a lengthy process, but one that pays off for us hungry diners.\nmedia_camera Dishes pictured are Torigara Soy Ramen, Chicken Karaage with home made tartare sauce and Spider Roll.
