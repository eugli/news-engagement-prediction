If the coaches want to go down that way, it’s a good combination.” \nTogether, the duo combined for 45 hit-outs — limiting Hawthorn’s big men to only 19 between them — while their impact in numerous positions around the ground was influential. \n“Braydon’s been great this pre-season and he’s carrying that confidence forward,” Goldstein said. \n“I’ve seen him develop and grow for the last three or four years and he’s worked so hard. For someone of his size, he’s going to be very hard to move. \n“I’ve seen him work very hard and it’s no surprise, he deserves all of the credit he’s getting at the moment.” \nPreuss’ breakout display on Sunday came off the back of a promising showing as the sole ruckman in last week’s victory over Sydney. \nIn Coffs Harbour, the 21-year-old collected 29 hit-outs in the absence of Goldstein, establishing himself as a genuine contender for an early season senior debut. Preuss' hitout win % is the 2nd highest of any ruckman to play in the #JLTSeries so far. Gawn's is the 3rd lowest. #SuperCoach #AFLFantasy — Fantasy Freako (@FantasyFreako) February 26, 2017 \n“He was really strong last week taking the No. 1 ruck mantle and today he and Goldy chopped and changed and he played up forward,” North’s stand-in coach Josh Drummond said. \n“It’s a great problem to have — it’s what you want. That’s what the pre-season is for, to give those young guys a chance and he’s one who has certainly stepped up. \n“They’re both probably No.1 ruck types, in terms of them being genuine ruckmen, but he gave us something to think about with the way he played up forward.” \nBut while North Melbourne has favoured a one-ruck system in recent years, Preuss’ ability to have an impact up forward gives the coaching staff something to think about. \nHis three goals on Sunday were the result of two strong marks inside 50, as well as a clean pick-up and snap below his knees. \n“It’s a challenge for all of our guys budding for those ruck spots,” Drummond said. \n“The way the game is now with the limited interchange, you need guys to be flexible. \n“We haven’t had too much of a look at him up forward, so it was great for him to get that opportunity today. He took a couple of nice marks and looked dangerous. \n“They don’t go on trees, those big fellas, so it’s good to have a couple up and going and give us something to think about.” \nBut if Preuss’ form on the field is a plus, his development into a newly established fan favourite is a bonus — with supporters at Arden Street loving his attack on the footy. \n“This bloke has been one of the finds of the JLT Community Series,” Gerard Healy said on Fox Footy’s coverage. \n“It’s great when you see new talent coming in and new talent having a physical impact. \n“He looks like he is a woodchopper for fun.” View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
