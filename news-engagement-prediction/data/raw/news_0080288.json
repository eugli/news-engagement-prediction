It was a slick move.\" \nAfter what might be the biggest Oscars snafu in history, Jimmy Kimmel took to his show on Monday night to give his take on what happened when Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway mistakenly presented the best picture award to La La Land over Moonlight . \n\"What Warren did is he was confused so he handed it to Faye and let her read the winner,\" said Kimmel. \"In other words, Clyde through Bonnie under the bus. It was a slick move.\" \nKimmel said that during the mix-up he was seated in the audience preparing to end the Oscars next to Matt Damon, whom Kimmel jokingly had a back and forth with throughout the ceremony, extending their ongoing \"feud.\" \n\"We noticed some commotion going on and Matt says I think I heard the stage manager say they got the winner wrong,\" said Kimmel on his show. \"The stage manager is never on camera. It’s very unusual.\" \nKimmel said that when he joined the commotion onstage, Denzel Washington was trying to catch his attention to have him let Moonlight director Barry Jenkins give his acceptance speech he expressed after the La La Land producers handed over their statuettes to the correct winners. \n\"People around me said, 'oh did you pull a prank of some kind,'\" Kimmel added. \"If I had pulled a prank I wouldn’t just have the wrong winner’s name on the envelope. when they opened it there would be like a Bed Bath and Beyond coupon at the end of it.\" \nAfter the show, Kimmel said he spoke with Warren Beatty in the green room. Beatty told him the card he was given had Emma Stone's name on it, resulting in the fact that both Stone and Beatty held the two copies of the best actress card that PricewaterhouseCoopers made instead of Beatty holding the best picture card. \nKimmel, however, joked that Dunaway made a \"getaway\" before having to give an explanation. \n\"Faye Dunaway made quite a getaway. she got the hell out of there. She read the wrong name and she split. She wanted no part of it.\" \nWatch Kimmel's full monologue below.
