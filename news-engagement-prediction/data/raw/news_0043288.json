Yet, for SPLC purposes there are more groups to hype. \nIn fact, SPLC’s hate-hype machine is so lucrative that the group now boasts an incredible $250 million in the bank, in addition to raising $40 million per year. \nWalker also detailed how the SPLC exaggerates the problem by counting every affiliate group as a separate hate group, writing that last year’s “list of anti-government groups, for example, includes 44 chapters of Phyllis Schlafly’s Eagle Forum, 24 chapters of the John Birch Society, a separate listing for ‘the John Birch Society Shop,’ and the paleolibertarian website LewRockwell.com.” \nSurprised that groups such as Eagle Forum receive listing as “hate groups”? Wonder how a website such as LewRockwell.com — featuring a variety of opinion pieces — can possibly be a “hate group”? \nThey have plenty of company. Any religious organization (or newsletter) holding that homosexuality is a sin or that heterosexual parents are better for children may be listed as a “hate group.” Groups such as the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), which don’t favor open borders and amnesty for immigrants in the country illegally, are “hate groups.” \nIn the course of highlighting the rise of anti-Muslim groups, in its latest report, the SPLC attacks a number of Islamic scholars and reformers, including Maajid Nawaz, who now fears that the SPLC label will become his death sentence at the hands of Muslim extremists. \n“I am a brown, liberal, reform Muslim. I have survived violent neo-Nazi racism and served as a former War on Terror political prisoner in Egypt, witnessing torture,” he told The Daily Beast . “Yet, in a trip that takes us through the looking glass, the largely white American non-Muslim ‘progressive’ leadership at the pro-civil liberties group Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) has just published a ‘journalist’s field list’ naming me as an ‘anti-Muslim’ extremist.” \nOf course, the SPLC list of hate groups actually doesn’t have anything whatsoever to do with violent extremism. “Let me say for starters that when we name groups ‘hate groups,’ that has nothing to do with any allegation of criminality or some kind of measure of expected violence,” SPLC mouthpiece Mark Potok admitted on MSNBC. “It’s purely about ideology.” \nThe whole SPLC scam is to lump political opponents — conservatives and libertarians — in with Nazis and the KKK, in order to smear them. \nAnd with disastrous consequences, as the folks at the Family Research Council (FRC) can attest. Just over four years ago, Floyd Corkins walked into the group’s headquarters, which he found using SPLC’s “Hate Map.” Armed with a semi-automatic pistol, his intent, as he admitted in open court, was to “kill as many as possible and smear the Chick-Fil-A sandwiches in victims’ faces.” He ended up only severely injuring the security guard. \nWhy did Corkins try to murder people with the FRC? He told FBI interrogators that, “Southern Poverty Law lists anti-gay groups. I found them online, did a little research, went to the website, stuff like that.” \nLet’s stipulate that the SPLC isn’t responsible for the acts of that violent man. But that doesn’t stop the SPLC hypocrites from blaming President Trump for “many” of “the wave of post-election hate incidents . . . that . . . appear to have been inspired by him and feature references to his name .” \nNor does the SPLC accept any blame for mislabeling people and groups as “hateful” and “extremist,” even when those labels are increasingly being used as an excuse for violence. At UC Berkeley and elsewhere, we now hear left-wing groups and activists claiming a license to “shut down” or beat down people they claim are “fascists.” \nThe recent headline in National Review best sums up the SPLC worldview: “Everyone Who Disagrees with the SPLC Is Hitler.” \nIt’s time the mainstream media got a clue and covered the SPLC accordingly. “Many news organizations, from wire services to TV networks, covered the new [SPLC] figures uncritically,” a Foreign Policy piece argued, adding that “their research needs to be weighed more carefully by media outlets that cover their pronouncements.” \nThis country needs an anti-hate group that isn’t itself a hate group .
