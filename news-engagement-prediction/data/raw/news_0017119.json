Velazquez claims the man has a work visa for the United States. She said the ICE officer claimed to have a warrant and tried to detain him, so he ran. At some point, the man and the officer ended up on the ground wrestling. \nAccording to Velazquez, the officer reported the man punched him during the scuffle. \nThere were originally conflicting reports about who was taken to a medical facility for evaluation. ICE now confirms one of their officers was checked out at a free-standing ER and released. \nFollowing the arrest, Austin City Council Member Greg Casar spoke out against “large amounts” of ICE sweeps he says have been taking place in North Austin in the past day. \n“ICE actions like these are beyond reprehensible. They instill fear in the community, and they make everyday people fear for their lives,” Casar said. \nCasar is the same city council member who last week put out an infographic telling illegal immigrants not to comply with federal immigration officials and urging them to “fight back.” \nICE claims they are not conducting sweeps of illegal aliens. \nThe arrest arrives as the annual “Texas warrant roundup” kicks off, with several state and local law enforcement agencies targeting locals who are wanted for arrest. \nMore on this as it develops… NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew.
