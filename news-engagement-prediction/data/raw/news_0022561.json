By Maggie Finn Ryan For Prevention February 10, 2017 image point fr/shutterstock \nPsst, there's a muscle you're probably missing in your workouts. Odds are, you've never heard of it, but if it's weak, it can wreak havoc on your body, causing shoulder and neck pain . \nThe serratus anterior is a knifelike, jagged muscle that originates on the underside of the shoulder blade—near the inner border—and attaches to the ribs. Its job is to offer stability during the upward rotation of the shoulder blade, which happens when you lift your arms above your head.

Also, it can yank and crank on the neck. \nFortunately, you may actually be able to prevent neck and shoulder pain by strengthening the serratus anterior. In order to target this muscle, you can perform subtle movements that draw the shoulder blades (or scapulae) together and apart, which is called retraction and protraction. \nHere are three different variations of the \" scapular push-up ,\" which strengthens the serratus anterior and improves overall shoulder mobility. \nRelated: 6 Moves To Shrug Off Shoulder Pain \n\"The exercises below increase in difficulty as you are supporting more of your own body weight with each progression, which requires more strength in your core , shoulders, and upper back to maintain the correct positioning,\" says Emily Cook Harris, a certified personal trainer who is founder/head trainer of EMPOWERED and creator of NYC FITWeek. \nHold the retracted position in each variation for a few seconds, and perform 10 reps with good form. Beginner: Wall Scapular Push-Up \nPlace your hands on a wall in front of you with fully extended arms. Engage your core , and keep your body and arms straight as you squeeze your shoulder blades together. (During this action, the shoulder blades draw together toward the midline of your back, and your chest moves a few inches closer to the wall.) Then, press into the hands as you draw the shoulder blades apart, and slightly round out the upper back. This is a slow and controlled movement. Hold the retracted position—with the shoulder blades drawing together—for 2 or 3 seconds. Perform 10 reps. Intermediate: Scapular Push-Up on the Knees \nBegin on all fours with your hands directly underneath your shoulders. Keeping arms straight, squeeze shoulder blades together toward the center of your back, and hold for 2 or 3 seconds. Do your best to keep the core engaged and back flat. Then press the upper back toward the ceiling as you return to the starting position. Advanced: High Plank Scapular Push-Up \nBegin in a high plank position with straight arms and hands directly underneath your shoulders. Draw the shoulder blades together on your back. Notice your chest drop toward the floor a few inches, and draw both sides of your navel in toward your spine. Hold for 2 or 3 seconds. Then press into your hands as you lift back up to the starting position.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T22:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T02:55:05.142+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
