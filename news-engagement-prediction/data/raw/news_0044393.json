Well, as pointed out by several astute Câ€™s followers, including MassLive.comâ€™s Jay King, Thomas sent out the same tweet just before Boston signed Al Horford over the offseason. Not saying it means anything, butâ€¦ \nAnother time Isaiah Thomas tweeted the eyes emoji: right before the Al Horford signing. pic.twitter.com/MNmZ2qFRbR \nâ€” Jay King (@ByJayKing) February 21, 2017 \nThe question thus shifted: If the Celtics are about to make a trade, who could they be getting? Jimmy Butler ? Paul George ? Andrew Bogut ? \nHmm â€¦ how about Drummond? \nDrummond not only retweeted Thomasâ€™ eyeball tweet. He also tweeted the emojis himself Tuesday morning, adding additional fuel to the Celtics trade speculation. ðŸ‘€ \nâ€” Andre Drummond (@AndreDrummond) February 21, 2017 \nIf that wasnâ€™t enough, Drummond apparently did some work to his Twitter profile, removing any references to the Pistons and changing his profile photo. Ok so Andre Drummond RT'd IT's ðŸ‘€ and tweeted ðŸ‘€ himself. Removed Pistons from his bio. And changed his profile pic to this. pic.twitter.com/0UPaFiHR8n \nâ€” AJBZ4 (@AjaxBeatz4) February 21, 2017 \nMaybe Drummond wanted to mess with peopleâ€™s heads. Maybe he just wants to be like I.T. Hell, maybe heâ€™s a big fan of eyeballs and sight is his favorite of the senses. \nIt doesnâ€™t really matter. Because even though not a single word was said or tweeted by Thomas or Drummond, the internet started going crazy, which really speaks to the unpredictability surrounding this yearâ€™s trade deadline, especially as it relates to the Celtics.
