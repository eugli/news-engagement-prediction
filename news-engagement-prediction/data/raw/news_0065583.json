AP Originally Published By: \nHumanity’s life insurance policy just got upgraded. \nThe Svalbard Global Seed Vault, tucked away in the Arctic Circle between Norway and the North Pole, has received a new intake of 50,000 seeds from all over the world. \nThe building houses an immense number of plant seeds to ensure Earth’s ongoing food security, and as such holds the key to human survival in a potentially post-apocalyptic world. \nThe incredible building is buried 425 feet inside a mountain and is designed to protect crop seeds such as beans, rice, and wheat from nuclear war or disease. \nFor obvious reasons, the underground concrete structure is popularly known as the Doomsday Vault.

Seeds for these Peruvian potatoes and sweet potatoes were brought to the vault in 2008.

Each variety will contain on average of 500 seeds, so a maximum of 2.5 billion seeds may be stored,” the Crop Trust website says. \nIn order to prevent contamination, seed samples are shipped to the island in large boxes, where they are scanned with X-rays to ensure the contents are safe. \nTo protect its assets, the vault comes equipped with five doors with coded locks, which are accessible by only a few people in the world. \nTo further ensure security, the vault is only unlocked for deposits three or four times a year. \nFor optimal storage, the seeds are sealed in custom-made three-ply foil packages and are kept near zero degrees Fahrenheit. \nThankfully, the location of the vault works as a failsafe for these conditions. \n“Permafrost and thick rock ensure that the seed samples will remain frozen even without power,” the website reads.
