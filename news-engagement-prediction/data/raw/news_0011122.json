GETTY IMAGES \nRoss Taylor was all aggression during his knock. \nNew Zealand lead the series 1-0 after a win in Auckland and an abandoned match in Napier but have to win the final encounter to take the trophy back from the holders. \nThe hosts were poised for a huge score when they reached 162-2 off 30 overs but the Australian quick bowlers pegged back the scoring rate and took regular wickets as Taylor became little more than a frustrated spectator. New Zealand lost 5-43 in a 13-over spell that swung the match back in Australia's favour. GETTY IMAGES \nDean Brownlie made a half-century on his return to the New Zealand one-day side. \nTaylor, who made a century in his previous international appearance in his home town in the second test against Pakistan in November before undergoing eye surgery, struck 13 fours in his 101-ball knock. \nThe right-hander had a life on 38 in the 25th over when he top-edged a cut off James Faulkner and part-time wicket-keeper Peter Handscomb dived full-length to his right but could only get the end of his glove to the ball as it passed for boundary. \nDean Brownlie, given the opening job in place of an injured Martin Guptill, contributed a composed and creditable 63 of 78 deliveries - his first ODI half-century - and added 100 in a third-wicket stand dominated by Taylor. GETTY IMAGES \nHamilton turned on a stunner for the Chappell-Hadlee finale. \nAfter the early exit of Tom Latham, skipper Kane Williamson and Brownlie got the innings moving. Ad Feedback \nOnce testing spells from Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood ended, the duo rapidly flourished against Marcus Stoinis and Pat Cummins. \nWilliamson's class was illustrated by two gorgeous cuts behind point in Stoinis's first over and an effortless pick off his pads from Cummins for another boundary at the start of the next over. \nHowever, the introduction of leg-spinner Adam Zampa slowed NZ's charge and ultimately played a part in Williamson's dismissal for 37 off 42 balls. The captain had lost his early flow and perished when he got a thin edge to a delivery from Cummins which moved late and cramped NZ's key batsman. \nAfter Brownlie fell, NZ's middle-order crumbled around Taylor but Mitchell Santner's 38 not out off 34 balls could prove invaluable as the hosts plundered an unexpected 30 off the last two overs. \nNew Zealand surprisingly omitted leg-spinner Ish Sodhi from their XI after he had been drafted into the squad specifically for the final ODI in Hamilton, opting to stick with raw speedster Lockie Ferguson. \nIt seemed there was enough from Zampa - who doesn't appear to have as many weapons in his arsenal as Sodhi - to suggest the hosts may have missed a trick in their selection. \nHazlewood took 2-44 off his 10 overs for the visitors while left-armer Starc took two wickets in the final over to end with 3-63 and Faulkner took 3-59 off nine. \nNew Zealand: Dean Brownlie, Tom Latham (wk), Kane Williamson (captain), Ross Taylor, Neil Broom, Colin Munro, James Neesham, Mitchell Santner, Tim Southee, Lockie Ferguson, Trent Boult. \nAustralia: Aaron Finch (captain), Travis Head, Shaun Marsh, Peter Handscomb (wk), Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, James Faulkner, Pat Cummins, Adam Zampa, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T09:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T04:32:02.204+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
