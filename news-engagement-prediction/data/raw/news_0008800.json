USA: Iranian man makes triumphant return to LA after challenging 'Muslim ban' 1:12 \nEmotions ran high as Iranian national Ali Vayeghan was welcomed by family members at Los Angeles International Airport, Thursday. Vayeghan was initially turned away from the airport last Friday under US President Donald Trump executive order barring immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries. Vayeghan's family had been waiting to welcome him at the same terminal when he was detained for several hours by immigration officials, who then sent back him back to Iran. Vayeghan was only allowed to return to the US after the American Civil Liberties Union successfully filed a legal action against the federal government. On Sunday, US District Judge Dolly M. Gee ruled in favour of Vayeghan, stating that he had a legal travel visa and had been approved for a green card. The Judge added that not allowing his return was unconstitutional and would do him grave harm. Trump's executive order blocks citizens from 'countries of concern,' namely Syria, Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Yemen, Sudan and Libya from entering the US for 90 days. The order, which includes a blanket ban on Syrian refugees as well as nationals, which initially included US green card holders, has caused havoc at US and international airports and around the world. Many Middle Eastern travelers have been held at customs and refused travel as a result. Trump has since stated that he wants to give priority to Christians over Muslims who are trying to escape the Syrian conflict.
