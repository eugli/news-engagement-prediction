There is a spark between them but they are taking it slowly. It really is early days but they get on so well,\" a source close to the pair told the British newspaper. \nJones, 76, told the Sun in an interview that he and Presley, 71, have been friends for some time, and have been savoring their time together. \nFan theory suggests Elvis had a surprise cameo in 'Home Alone' \n\"She's a lovely lady. We do enjoy our nights out together,\" he said. \nThe American actress and businesswoman married The King of Rock 'n' Roll in a 1967 Las Vegas wedding.
