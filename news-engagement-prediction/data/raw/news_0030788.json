Jared Leto, the actor and singer-songwriter, who is a friend of the couple, became a Universal Life minister for the occasion to officiate. The bride, 34, who is keeping her name, is a producer at Paradox, a production company founded by Mr. Leto in Los Angeles. She graduated from New York University. The bride is the daughter of Judith A. Whitworth of Sydney, Australia, and John Ludbrook of Melbourne, Australia. The groom, 44, based in Los Angeles, was the president of the Windish Agency, an independent music agency that he founded in Chicago in 2004 and sold in January to the Paradigm Talent Agency, where he is now a senior executive, responsible for booking tours for bands and D.J.s. The groom is a son of Mary Ellen Windish and Thomas J. Windish of Schenectady, N.Y. When a mutual friend introduced the couple in January 2015 at a bus stop during the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, Ms. Ludbrook mentioned that she would be going to a Creative Artists Agency party that evening. \n  “I tried to get on the guest list,” said Mr. Windish, who ended up being turned away because he was a rival to the entertainment and talent agency. He figured out another way in when he went with a friend. “I was his plus one,” he said. But, that evening, he did not even exchange as much as a perfunctory hello with her. “It was really crowded, and every time I went to check on her, she was surrounded,” said Mr. Windish, who was coming to grips with a serious relationship about to end. Ms. Ludbrook, dating casually and not looking for a boyfriend, was intrigued by Mr. Windish after their first chat. “I knew his name because I knew his company,” she said, and soon found, “we had been at the same parties and events many, many times.” During the festival they found themselves at several of the same events. At one of them they had a chance to talk more, mostly industry chatter, and they exchanged contact information. A couple of weeks later, they connected to meet for sushi in Los Angeles.
