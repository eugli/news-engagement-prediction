Close White House to revise federal directive on transgender bathroom use in public schools UP NEXT VIDEO White House to revise federal directive on transgender bathroom use in public schools \nThe draft reverses former Democratic President Barack Obama's signature initiative on transgender rights, which instructed public schools to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms matching their gender identity. \n\"I would expect further guidance to come out on that today,\" White House spokesman Sean Spicer told a news briefing on Thursday. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said President Donald Trump \"has made it clear throughout the campaign that he is a firm believer in states' rights.\" Source: Yahoo \nThe draft document, a joint effort of the Justice and Education departments, could be subject to change before it is sent to schools across the country. \nIts issuance was delayed by a disagreement between two members of Trump's Cabinet, with Attorney General Jeff Sessions pushing for a repeal of the Obama guidance and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos resisting, according to advocacy groups that have been in contact with administration officials. \nSpicer, however, denied any serious division, saying, \"There is no daylight between anybody, between the president, between any of the secretaries\" and that DeVos was in agreement \"100 percent.\" \nThe document states that its purpose is to withdraw the guidance of May 13, 2016, while Trump's Justice and Education departments \"further consider the legal issues involved.\" Trump expected to revoke rules on transgender bathrooms. Source: 7News \nLast year's guidance, issued by Obama's Justice and Education departments, threatened to withhold federal funding if schools forced transgender students to use bathrooms corresponding to their gender assigned at birth against their will. \nConservatives have raised fears about men or boys claiming to be transgender in order to spy or prey on women or girls in public restrooms. \nUnder the new guidelines, public schools could set their own rules without fear of losing federal funds or a lawsuit from the Justice Department. \nDuring the election campaign, Trump at first said transgender people should be able to use the bathroom they feel is appropriate, but changed tack after coming under criticism from fellow Republicans, saying it should be a matter for states to decide. States that have considered legislation in 2016 that would restrict access to sex-segregated facilities on the basis of biological sex. Most recent data available as of January 5, 2017. Source: Yahoo \nOn Tuesday, that \"states' rights\" position was repeated by White House spokesman Spicer. His comments were immediately criticized by transgender legal advocates, who say federal law and civil rights are matters for the federal government to enforce, not the states. \nThe federal law in question, known as Title IX, bans sex discrimination in education. But it remains unsettled whether Title IX protections extend to a person's gender identity. The US Supreme Court could settle the issue in a case due to be argued in March. \nThe draft document challenges the Obama interpretation that Title IX protects gender identity, saying it has \"given rise to significant litigation\" and has confused educators who have \"struggled to understand and apply\" the previous guidance. Classifications are derived from state-wide employment non-discrimination laws.
