It has been raining since the day before yesterday [Saturday]. It hasn't even stopped once,\" Mr Quail said. \n\"The river at the moment is six foot [1.8 metres] from the door, but I would say it will be through here in another couple of hours.

(Facebook: Mikey Cunningham) Rain good for fishing \nDespite damaging property, Mr Quail said the flood would be good for fishing and mud crabbing in the region, which had seen poor catches over the past few years. \n\"This river needed a flush, it was dead,\" he said. \n\"It was the worst fishing, over the last couple of years, that I have ever seen here. \n\"The fish like the fresh water, they will come in. Usually this time of year we get the snapper come into the river to breed, so they will be here.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T10:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T05:56:30.917+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
