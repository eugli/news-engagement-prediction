The NBA issued a rule clarification less than two hours after the completion of the game in which Howard was ejected for a second technical foul in the third quarter.\nAccording to release by the league: “The second technical foul called tonight on Atlanta’s Dwight Howard for hanging on the rim (4:03 remaining in the third quarter at Boston) should have been deemed non-sportsmanlike and should not have resulted in his ejection.”\nHoward received a technical foul with 9:31 left in the third quarter for shoving the Celtics’ Al Horford after a foul. The second technical foul, called by referee James Williams, came 5:28 later and sent Howard to the locker room. The technical fouls were the 10 th and 11 th of the season for Howard.\nAccording to NBA rules, non-sportsmanlike technical fouls that don’t count toward ejection are excessive timeouits, delay of game, having an untucked jersey and hanging on the rim.\nHoward said after the game he should have been ejected.\n“That should be more of a warning,” Howard said. “I did the same thing in the first half and nothing happened.”\nTurns out Howard was right.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T08:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T09:11:22.322+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
