(Photo: Tirami Su Ristorante Italiano) 169 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThe proprietor of Tirami Su Ristorante Italiano in Northville is set to open a second location Downriver in late April or early May. To be located in Riverview at 17780 Fort Street, the restaurant will occupy the building that formerly housed La Dolce Vita restaurant, which closed several years ago. \nOwner and chef Frank Grippi, 56, says the restaurant will seat about 125-130 and will also have bar seating. It will offer a similar menu and pricing as the Northville location but with a concentration on Sicilian fare. \nBased on the Northville menu, expect a plenty of pasta dishes, salads and entrees including chicken and veal dishes. Grippi says their signature dish is Veal Michelangelo, which is described on the menu as “as sautéed veal with jumbo shrimp and sea scallops in a lightly spiced tomato cream sauce flavored with crabmeat and just a touch of brandy.” \nThe interior and exterior are being completely renovated, says Grippi, who does not own the building. He expects to employ 25 to 30 full- and part-timers. \nGrippi says with the exception of a few stuffed pastas that he buys fresh, all other pasta at Tirami Su is made from scratch. \nContact Susan Selasky at 313-222-6872 or sselasky@freepress.com.
