Article continues below \nThose plans, though, will upset Manchester United, who had to quickly get over the Spaniard's failed transfer deadline day move to the Santiago Bernabeu back in September 2015. Real returning for De Gea \nReal's no.1, Keylor Navas, was set to head to Old Trafford as part of the Â£29 million deal that would have taken De Gea to Real Madrid, but Los Blancos' failure to submit the required paperwork to La Liga on time resulted in the transfer being rejected. \nHowever, Real clearly still rate their chances of luring the Spain international away from Manchester, but they will face a fight to agree on a deal with the Red Devils, as Jose Mourinho has put together a plan to keep his key asset. \nAs per Marca , Mourinho reportedly believes the club's goalkeeping coach, Emilo Alvarez, can be influential in convincing De Gea to remain in the Premier League. \nAlvarez was De Gea's goalkeeping coach during his days at Atletico, which ultimately helped him produce the performances which earned him a move to Old Trafford in the first place. Alvarez influential in goalkeeper's future \nUnited's goalkeeping coach convinced then Atletico boss Quique Sanchez Flores to select the young and inexperienced Atletico academy graduate over both Sergio Asenjo and now Everton goalkeeper Joel Robles. \nAnd that is in part why Mourinho believes his colleague can tempt De Gea to stay put - given how influential Alvarez has been on his career so far. \nBut De Gea's future at United will not simply be in Mourinho's hands, and the Spaniard's future could hinge on whether the Red Devils are in the Champions League next season. \nMourinho's men have had to settle for Europa League football this season, and De Gea will be important to their chances of success. But it's unlikely the Spaniard will settle for such a level of European football for a second consecutive campaign. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
