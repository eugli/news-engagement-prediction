So if a tornado rips through your state or a hurricane breaches your jetties or an earthquake cripples your town, the federal government won't necessarily be there to help rebuild, writes Nathalie Baptiste. \nTheproposal to cut disaster aid was part of a lengthy report released last year by the Heritage Foundation. Dubbed a Blueprint for Balance , the document argued that the federal government can save $10.5 trillion over the next decade by slashing funds for some programs and eliminating others. [...] \nThe Heritage Foundation is extremely influential in the world of conservative politics, and the Trump administration appears ready to lean on the think tank for policy ideas. Donald Trump's transition team was stacked with advisers from Heritage, and the organization helped the president compile a list of potential Supreme Court picks. The Hill reported in January that a series of massive budget cuts being considered by the Trump administration \"hew closely\" to the Heritage budget blueprint. \nEmergency or disaster declarations by a president currently prompt FEMA to help locales rebuild and provide immediate public health relief for up 75 percent of the costs. \nBut if the Heritage budget is implemented, state and local governments would have to pony up 75 percent of the costs, up to $5 billion. If the cost of an individual disaster tops $5 billion, the federal government's share would gradually increase, reaching 75 percent only if the damage exceeds $20 billion. The proposal would also completely eliminate FEMA's fire grants, which subsidize local fire departments. \nThis scheme stands to completely strap many states with bills they cannot afford, especially in situations where they experience more than one disaster within the span of several years. \nIn Georgia, officials estimate at least $100 million of damage so far from last month's tornadoes. The same part of the state was hit with tornadoes earlier in January, so local resources are all but exhausted. In Mississippi, officials predict insurers could be on the hook for $200 million in the city of Hattiesburg alone. As with most natural disasters, one of the most pressing needs was emergency housing. In Forrest County, Mississippi, more than 1,000 homes were damaged, and 239 were destroyed completely. \n\"One of the most common features of a declared disaster is you have a lot of suddenly homeless people,\" says Becker, who worked with New York City residents in the aftermath of Sandy. Without FEMA assistance in these types of disasters, she says, there would be much more homelessness, as displaced people rack up hotel bills and fall behind on mortgage payments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T08:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T03:16:42.397+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
