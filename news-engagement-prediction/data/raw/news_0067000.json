But it is affecting my mother the most. \n“Friends suggested that she seeks some form of trauma counselling here (in Singapore). They told us that counselling will provide some form of relief,” he said. \nHe was uncertain as to when they would be returning, but said they looked forward to coming home. \nOn the response to the family’s reward of up to RM100,000 for the safe recovery of his father, Jonathan said there had been “nothing concrete” so far. \nThose who messaged, he said, might claim to have seen a car, but could not provide more details. \n“So neither the police nor us can follow up on the information provided,” Jonathan said. \nHe also thanked everyone who had been sending his family well wishes and encouragement on the dedicated number (011-3973-2670) set up by the family for information. \nHowever, he said that number was only for information, which could help find his father. \n“It is not meant to be for anything else,” said Jonathan. \nKoh, 62, was abducted on Feb 13 by a group of masked men at Jalan SS4B/10, Petaling Jaya, less than 100m from a police housing complex. \nHe was driving a silver Honda Accord bearing the licence plate ST 5515 D and wearing a beige polo shirt and dark grey pants. \nHis abduction was confirmed by Selangor CID chief Senior Asst Comm Fadzil Ahmat. \nSAC Fadzil, who is also leading the special task force in the investigation, said the police were currently “looking into several leads”. \nSix years ago, Koh had received a bullet that was sent to his home, a close friend had revealed. \nKoh lodged a police report about the death threat that had come after the Selangor Islamic Religious Depart­ment conducted a raid on a thanksgiving and fund-rising dinner organised by Harapan Komuniti. \nThe community centre in Taman Sri Manja was set up by Koh in 2004 to help single mothers, drug addicts and those with HIV/AIDS, and also served as a place for children to learn English, have free tuition or do their homework.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T02:43:56.625+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
