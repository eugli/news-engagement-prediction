TMZ reports that Nicki's house was \"totally trashed\" while the rapper was out of town sometime between November and January, and that the suspect or suspects flipped over furniture and knocked over multiple items throughout the house as though looking for something in particular. Sources close to the case also told TMZ that the damage looked \"personal,\" and that the burglars had \"destroyed picture frames, perfume bottles, [and] furniture,\" and had also cut up some of Nicki's clothing.\n According to E! News , police have not yet named any suspects in the case and the investigation is still ongoing. Since Nicki's home is reportedly \"equipped with security systems and closed circuit cameras,\" police are hoping to find video footage of the burglary in order to help with their investigation.\nAt this time, Nicki has not released a statement on the matter.\nFrom: Cosmopolitan", "external_links": ["http://www.tmz.com/2017/02/02/nicki-minaj-house-burglary/", "http://www.eonline.com/news/826396/nicki-minaj-s-home-burglarized-175-000-worth-of-property-stolen", "http://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a8666492/drake-nicki-minaj-friends-again/", "http://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a8671376/nicki-minaj-home-robbery/"], "published": "2017-02-03T21:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T16:22:09.450+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
