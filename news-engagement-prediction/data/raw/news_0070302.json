It's like he and his guests are bromancing and sitting in our living rooms with us, and we're all laughing our butts off together. And some of the most hilarious moments on Fallon's show take place during the crazy games he makes his guest play — but those games are so outrageous, we shouldn't dare play the same ones at home, right? Wrong! \nFallon's game-time hijinks on The Tonight Show would make for one amazing party, especially if you get a few cocktails involved. We've gathered up some of Fallon's best games that you should totally try for yourself. \nMore: Jimmy Fallon's 2017 Golden Globes Opening Number Was So Meme-able 1. Would You Rather \nThis game has always been the worst because it normally takes a dark, dirty or gross turn, and still we ask, why aren't we playing it more often? Asking acquaintances, \"Would you rather have a clone of yourself or have a pet dog who can talk?\" is guaranteed to break the ice at any party. 2. The Whisper Challenge \nThis is the kind of game where you spend the majority of the time trying not to pee your pants laughing because it's just so ridiculous. As Blake Shelton and Fallon demonstrate, the Whisper Challenge involves wearing noise-canceling headphones and attempting to guess random words and phrases. May the best (wo)man win. 3. Best Friends Challenge \nNow, this one is kind of adorable and perfect for a more intimate gathering, aka a girls' night in. How well do you know your bestie? You can each take turns drawing questions from the Best Friends Box to see if you can guess each other's answers. At the very least, you'll get to know each other better — by figuring out her most hated food and her first celebrity crush. 4. Slapjack \nThe premise here is simple. You square off against a friend (or foe?) in a game of blackjack. The person who loses each hand gets, well, a hand — to the face. And, really, what's more fun than slapping someone with giant prosthetic digits? OK, so you may have to substitute the monster hand with a foam finger from a sporting event or with a pillow. 5. Wheel of Impressions \nDisclaimer: There's no way in hell you or any of your loved ones could rival Kevin Spacey when it comes to Wheel of Impressions. He's just too good. Did you catch his Johnny Carson? Still, it will be pretty hilarious to watch your friends attempt to impersonate people like Samuel L. Jackson talking about, oh, you know, something like bubble wrap. To adapt for your home, simply write a bunch of celeb names down and toss them into one basket, and write down a bunch of random topics and toss them in another. Voilà! 6. Random Phrase Carols 'Random Phrase Carols' with Reese Witherspoon by bangla-media \nTo be honest, this is kind of what it sounds like when I get to the second verse of most Christmas carols (do you know the second verse to \"Away in a Manger\"?). You'll need someone who isn't playing to be the penner of the random lyrics and you'll need an instrumental Christmas music CD. \nMore: Jimmy Fallon's #WhyImSingle Went From Funny to Feminist Real Quick 7. Box of Lies \nSorry, ladies... this game doesn't come with Channing Tatum , as super as that would be. The gist is this: You stick about nine random things in shoe boxes. You create a makeshift partition between you and your non-Channing-Tatum-like competitor, and then you take turns trying to determine whether you each are telling the truth about what's in your chosen box or whether you're flat-out lying. \nOriginally published December 2014.
