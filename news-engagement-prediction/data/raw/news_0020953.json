Monitor sales before and after placement Give unique URL / phone number to measure traffic Impressions (for TV / Billboard) Survey – ask people how they heard of you or the campaign \nNow, I'm clearly biased, I admit, however, if I came to sell you on two campaigns, with one having eight different measurable data points and the other having four, which would you choose on trackability alone? \nIts time to challenge the status quo and stop relying on 'guesstimate' data. \nThere’s a reason digital advertising dollars surpassed TV in 2016. 3. Quick-Win vs. Long-Term \nI like to make the comparison that traditional advertising is rooted in the quick win, while digital is focused on long term growth. \nIt might sound weird given the fast-paced nature of digital, however through storytelling, community building and audience nurturing we can start to develop tangible brand equity with digital advertising. \nSince competition is higher than ever, and consumers need more nurturing to make a purchasing decision, does it really make sense to dump a ton of dollars into a quick-win effort? \nIf someone doesn’t covert after watching your TV ad, you have no way of tactically getting back in front of that consumer, however through retargeting on search engines, display and social media advertising, you can. \nBy the way, did you know that users who are retargeted are 70% more likely to convert? \nMarketers in all industries need to think long and hard about whether they want to beat last month or beat last year. Digital advertising has way more potential to build on itself compared to traditional advertising. 4. Cost \nNow, the elephant in the room. Let’s talk cost of advertising. \nI took the bold stance earlier that social media advertising was the most cost effective way to reach a targeted group of consumers. I stand by that statement. \nUsing our own research and data, we typically see the following results in our social advertising campaigns: Facebook Cost per Click: $0.23 - $0.75 Facebook Cost per 1000 Impressions: $5.11 - $10.99 Instagram Cost per 1000 Impression: $20 \nResults will vary for industries, budgets and targeting. I won’t spoil the fun for you, I encourage you to research typical CPCs and CPMs for traditional advertising. I'm fairly confident you'll find that it's nowhere as affordable as social media. \nI love this quote: \n\"Digital advertising is not only pulling dollars from traditional media, but it's also creating new opportunities at the local and national level\". \n- eMarketer forecasting analyst Martin Utreras \nThere's no way in hell your local donut shop would have the budget to run a local TV and radio spot on a measurable and consistant basis. However, with digital advertising they could reach thousands of targeted consumers for a few hundred dollars. 5. Collaboration, Not Competition \nAt the end of the day, all campaigns should have a multi-channel approach. \nTraditional advertising absolutely has its place (despite not being overly trackable or affordable). If we once again think about the ping-pong example, we need to give consumers multiple ways to interact with brands, not simply dump money into one channel. \nA colleague of mine put it this way: \n“First and foremost, we all need to keep in mind that customers see us as a brand entity first. Their expectation is that we will be available and responsive on every channel we use. So, if we want to see the greatest return on the investment in traditional media buys, we will need to put resources into the places our customers go after they've heard our radio spot or watched our TV commercial. There are lots of great studies on how both social media engagement and mobile search queries spike by both location and time of day to coincide with a TV or radio placement. If we want to close the loop on communication opened by traditional spend, we need to be ready to track online engagement in response to those ads.\" \n- Michelle Stinson Ross \nMichelle makes an incredible point. TV commercials get talked about on social media. They get shared, supported and even leaked ahead of time on YouTube. But traditional really works best when it also has a digital component. \nWe need to get away from the idea that your brand can be competitive with vanity campaigns and limping onto the field where their target consumer is spending the most time. \nMain image via Pexels", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T16:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T08:29:42.912+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
