Francis Pangilinan said that its members have postponed the decision of leaving the supermajority of the House of Representative due to pending death penalty vote. Philstar.comFile photo/Geremy Pintolo MANILA, Philippines — The Liberal Party (LP) members at the House of Representatives supermajority postponed their decision on whether to stay or leave until voting on the death penalty bill, Sen. Francis Pangilinan said on Tuesday. In a televised interview, Pangilinan, the LP president said that the party wanted to focus first on the death penalty bill, which is pending for vote on second reading this week. \"As a matter of timing, unahin dapat yung debate sa death penalty para matiyak na mailabas yung pinakamaayos na boto tungkol dito,\" Pangilinan said. \"After which, we will convene again and finalize our decision on the matter of whether or not the House contingent will now join the minority,\" he added. The party had a meeting a day after its members at the Senate were kicked out of the majority bloc. On Monday, the Senate majority with Sen. Manny Pacquiao’s making his motions on the floor, agreed to declare the position of Sen. Franklin Drilon, who was Senate president pro-tempore, vacant. Sens. Pangilinan, Benigno Aquino IV and Risa Hontiveros, were also ousted from committees they held as part of the Upper House's majority.

We have to discuss, we have to debate, we have to hear. In fact, dito tatlong oras ang pagpupulong dahil nga pinoproseso ng maayos,\" the LP senator said. \"We have to manage the decision making process from the death penalty and then the matter of leaving the supermajority,\" he added.
