Rusting still remain on the abandoned ships in Landevennec, France, formerly used during the war years. The intriguing images show the derelict, cramped quarters where soldiers would have spent many secluded months living in their own floating villages.\nOne of the most famous ships resting in the docks is the French cruiser Colbert, an anti-aircraft ship that was deployed during the Cold War and later turned into a museum.\nThe ship, which has awaited scrapping since 2007, is fitted with replica missiles and memorabilia from its years of service.
