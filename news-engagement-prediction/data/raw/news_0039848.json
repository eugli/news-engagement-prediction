State would do well to choose its next men's basketball coach from this group, which includes successful mid-major coaches and a high-major coach who may need a change of scenery. From left: Tom Crean, Archie Miller, Kevin Keatts  45  45 p.m. ET \nMark Gottfried is out as N.C. State’s basketball coach. \nWell, he’ll be out soon. The school announced Thursday that Gottfried will finish out the regular season and ACC Tournament as the team’s head coach, but he won’t return next year. \nDeCOURCY: With big opportunity ahead, State must identify right guy \nSo … who’s next? Even before the official announcement, it was reported that the school was already reaching out to prospective replacements. Here are 10 guys who could potentially be named the next N.C. State coach within the next month or so: Archie Miller, Dayton head coach \nWhy Miller? He’s the guy at the top of the list for most Wolfpack fans, and he’s already had to deny reports that N.C. State reached out to him before the news about Gottfried was official. His connection to N.C. State is strong, of course. Miller played for the Wolfpack from 1997-2002 — he averaged 9.9 points and 2.9 assists per game as a senior and shot 42.9 percent from 3-point range for his career — and then was an assistant to head coach Herb Sendek at State from 2004-06. He was an assistant to Sendek at Arizona State in 2006-07, to Thad Matta at Ohio State in 2007-09 and to his brother, Sean Miller, at Arizona from 2009-11 before taking over as Dayton’s head coach for the 2011-12 season. \nMiller has done a brilliant job at Dayton, keeping the Flyers at or near the top of the Atlantic 10 the past couple seasons despite injuries and other potential roadblocks. Dayton has made the past three NCAA Tournaments and is essentially a lock to make it four in a row this March. The Flyers made the Elite Eight as an 11th seed in 2014 and the Sweet 16 as an 11 seed in 2015. Miller responded to questions about N.C. State on Thursday afternoon. Chris Holtmann, Butler head coach \nWhy Holtmann? He’s a coaching star on the rise who has ties to the state of North Carolina. Before he moved to Indiana to become an assistant to Butler’s Brandon Miller, he was the head coach at Gardner-Webb, where he had the Big South program in Boiling Springs, N.C., heading in the right direction (from eight wins the year before he arrived to 21 in his third and final year). Granted, it’s not like Boiling Springs is very near Raleigh, but we’re talking relative proximity here. Holtmann took over the Butler head coaching job when Miller took a medical leave after the 2014 season and earned the head job permanently when Miller didn’t return. Butler made the NCAA Tournament each of Holtmann’s first two years as head coach, and the Bulldogs are a lock to make him 3 for 3. \nFAGAN: Adjusting the Field of 68 after sneak peek at Top 16 Kevin Keatts, UNC Wilmington head coach \nWhy Keatts? He has been wildly successful at Wilmington. He took over a team that won just eight games the year before he arrived and won 18 in his first season (he was named Colonial Athletic Association Coach of the Year), then won 25 last season — including the CAA Tournament title and the accompanying automatic NCAA Tournament berth. This year, the Seahawks are 22-5 and could make a case as an at-large team should they stumble in the CAA tourney. Keatts also was a big part of Rick Pitino’s staff when the Louisville won the 2013 NCAA championship. He’ll be a star at a bigger school, probably sooner than later. King Rice, Monmouth head coach \nWhy Rice? Rice has been a hot name on the coaching carousel for a couple years now, for good reason. Monmouth hadn’t won more than 12 games in the five years before Rice took over for the 2011-12 season, his first as a Division I head coach. After a couple seasons to establish itself, Monmouth won 28 games last year and is 22-5 this season; the Hawks are 31-5 in Metro Atlantic play the past two seasons. Like Keatts, Rice will be a coaching star at a bigger school at some point, probably sooner than later. What makes Rice intriguing is his connection to the Tar Heel State, specifically, the Tar Heels basketball program. Rice was the point guard for UNC from 1987-91 under legendary coach Dean Smith. Rice is still sixth on the school’s all-time assist list with 629. Would State hire a Tar Heel? Would a Tar Heel coach at State? Pat Kelsey, Winthrop head coach \nWhy Kelsey? Not to be a broken record, but Kelsey is going to be a coaching star at a bigger school at some point, probably sooner than later. His basketball mentor was the brilliant Skip Prosser; Kelsey played for him at Xavier and was his assistant at Wake Forest. Kelsey is in his fifth season at Winthrop, and his Eagles are 20-6, marking the fourth year in a row they’ve won at least 19 games. Before he arrived, they’d won more than 13 just once in the previous four seasons. And remember the last time N.C. State passed on an established coach from Winthrop? Yep, that’s when it opted to hire Sidney Lowe instead of giving the job to Gregg Marshall, who has transformed Wichita State into one of the most consistently excellent teams in the country. Gregg Marshall, Wichita State head coach \nWhy Marshall? Realistically, this probably isn’t happening. As we just mentioned, State had its chance. Now, Marshall is making $3.5 million a year as the Shockers’ head coach and, if/when he leaves, it almost certainly won’t be for State, unless the Pack give him a raise and the lure of competing directly against Duke and UNC is too much to resist. He can have his pick of jobs. Tom Crean, Indiana head coach \nWhy Crean? It’s not that N.C. State is a better job than Indiana, but Crean’s coaching seat at IU is rather hot right about now. Lots of Hoosiers fans are calling for him to be fired, and it’s feasible to think Crean is looking for a soft landing to leave Bloomington. And, let’s be honest. This year has been super disappointing, but it’s not like Crean’s time at IU has been a disaster. Far from it. He took over a program that was decimated in the wake of Kelvin Sampson’s time there, and it only took a couple years to get the Hoosiers back in contention. His teams have a couple Big Ten regular-season titles and four NCAA Tournament berths, including a No. 1 seed in 2013. This is his ninth season in Bloomington, and maybe it’s just time for the sides to part ways. He could be an excellent addition for the Wolfpack. \nDeCOURCY: Crean risks losing locker room by publicly blasting IU players Will Wade, VCU head coach \nWhy Wade? It’s reasonable to think Wade is very happy in his current situation. He was an assistant at VCU for a couple seasons before leaving for the head coaching job at Chattanooga, where he won 40 games in his two seasons with the Mocs. When Shaka Smart left VCU for Texas, though, the chance to coach the Rams proved irresistible for Wade. VCU won 25 games in his first year, and the Rams have 21 victories already this season. Wade has ACC ties; he graduated from Clemson and got his start for the Tigers as a grad assistant and then director of basketball operations. VCU’s a great job, but the lure of taking over an ACC program with a storied history could prove very tempting. Wade was rumored to be on Vanderbilt’s list of replacements for Kevin Stallings last year. LeVelle Moton, North Carolina Central head coach \nWhy Moton? His track record of success at Central is really impressive; his teams went 46-2 in the MEAC from 2013-15, and Central is 10-1 in conference play this season. He has an outstanding reputation in the sport, and he obviously knows the area — North Carolina Central’s campus in Durham is only about a half-hour from N.C. State’s campus. On the other hand, going from the MEAC to the ACC would be a giant, huge, massive jump and State is almost certainly looking to hire a bigger name. \nBIRDSONG: Moton tells his New Edition story Mick Cronin, Cincinnati head coach \nWhy Cronin? Before State hired Gottfried, Cronin was the guy many Wolfpack fans wanted to replace Sidney Lowe after the 2011 season. And State reportedly offered the job to Cronin, but he turned down the offer, which was rumored to be for less money than expected. Since then, Cronin has been connected to several other openings, and his price has only gone up — Cincinnati has made the NCAA Tournament six years in a row and won at least 22 games in each of those seasons. This year will be no different; the Bearcats are 23-3 overall and a lock to earn an at-large bid. Maybe this time around the two sides work something out.
