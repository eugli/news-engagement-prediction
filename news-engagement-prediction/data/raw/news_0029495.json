My mates say I blacked out for about 15 minutes,‚Äù added Mr Smith, who required hospital treatment. \nJD Wetherspoon said it had \"never encountered\" fighting on such a scale. \nTommy Arkle, 21, a friend of Mr Smith, captured a video of the violence on his phone, saying it started as a \"one vs one\" but escalated wildly.
