It’s startling to get a clear view of its gables and chapel tower, until now hidden behind a chequerboard flint wall, a fig tree and a hedge. Secret London: 14 odd attractions you never knew were there \nThe museum’s exhibition starts in the present and works its way back in time, the lights dimming as the artefacts become rarer and more fragile. The layout is simple: you walk up one side, which focuses on the charity, and back down the other, to its 14th-century roots. \nThe first object on show is a diminutive, frail-looking chair – its arms once gripped by the bony hands of a Carthusian prior, perhaps, or maybe Lord North, who built a sprawling estate here in the 1500s. Charterhouse School was located here until 1872, when it moved to Surrey \n“We call it the Tudor Chair,” says Dominic Tickell, who is in charge of the £4 million-plus redevelopment. “Except it’s not Tudor,” adds Cathy Ross, the curator, explaining that the chair is bodged: a composite made up of work from many different periods – just like the Charterhouse itself. \nVideo screens show the daily lives of the 40 Brothers who live here, as retired chaps have done since 1611 (women too, soon; the vote to accept them was passed last year). There are Fifties menus – Scotch broth and tapioca pudding – and an ominous list recording attendance at church: no pinprick on the page meant you were absent and consequently fined. The Charterhouse School's 'flog blog' recorded misdemeanours that merited 'swishing', such as 'outrageous cheek to monitors' (or prefects) \nThe punishment theme continued in the section on Charterhouse School, whose scholars also lived here until it moved to Surrey in 1872. A facsimile of the Black Book, the “flog blog”, recorded misdemeanours that merited “swishing”, such as “outrageous cheek to monitors” (or prefects), and there’s a laconic description of a “14-cutter” lashing from one schoolboy observer; perhaps that’s why the names of hated monitors are scratched out on the graffiti-covered school desk. \nThis half of the museum ends with displays about the sensationally wealthy, and childless, commoner Thomas Sutton, who in 1611 bought the Charterhouse and established a foundation to provide a home for up to 80 brothers and 40 poor scholars. He left the modern equivalent of hundreds of millions of pounds in his will. No wonder they managed to wangle him a coat of arms, despite his modest social status. It’s repeated everywhere. A new Charterhouse museum opens on Friday \nA neat device takes you around the corner into the second half: a glass cabinet, visible from both sides, shows first a Protestant Bible, printed in 1620, and a plain silver communion cup. As you turn into the display on the Tudor period, the far side shows an ornate, pre-Reformation Catholic chalice and an alabaster altar carving. \nThe Charterhouse survived the Dissolution for longer than many monasteries before succumbing, then was Puritan for 10 years in the mid-17th century before settling into the Anglican tradition. I loved this side: partly because of the polychrome wood statues, still vivid, hidden during the Reformation and Puritanism, but mainly for the three-yard-long 1341 diagram of the monastic water system, on sheets of vellum, which survived simply because it was needed. \nTo see bright, 600-year-old paint is something. To find that White Conduit Street in Islington, source of the fresh water piped south, is named after white-clad Carthusian monks is really something. \nThe display ends dramatically with the skeleton of a young man found during Crossrail’s engineering excavations. He is lying on a bed of gravel, surrounded by flickering lamps. Science tells us he came from East Anglia, had a bad back and rotting teeth – and in them were traces of Yersinia pestis, the Black Death that killed him in 1348. \"The Charterhouse is the only remnant we have of the old City, a part of London once packed with more than 100 parish churches\" \nAfter the museum you can visit the panelled Jacobean chapel and Thomas Sutton’s tomb, featuring, among grim reminders of mortality, a cherub blowing golden bubbles in a nod to the vagaries of life and luck. Look for the 1627 alabaster statues of Moses and Aaron and tiny carvings of American Indian faces, reflecting the first English colonies set up in the reign of King James I, when the chapel was extended. \nDo add on a tour of the Charterhouse, led by museum guides and running daily for the first time. The Brothers also do their own tours three times a week and both include the Great Hall, the Great Chamber with its plaster ceiling, and lovely outdoor courtyards with mulberry trees and lawns. \nTodd Longstaffe-Gowan’s planting in Charterhouse Square will burst forth this spring, a new café opens in February and Eric Parry’s new entrance will be completed for the opening on January 27.

For maximum atmosphere, go late (last admission 4.45pm) and stay for the evening service. \nNow that would be truly special.
