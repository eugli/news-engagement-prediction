its inspectors have unfairly pursued pet owners and hunts over allegations of cruelty.\nLast week it emerged that the Government ignored a recommendation by a cross-party committee of MPs that RSPCA stop prosecuting animal welfare cases.\nWatch | RSCPA Chief Executive admits the charity has made mistakes 01:19 H owever ministers have told The Telegraph that the RSPCA has been put on “probation” over its prosecutions policy.\nThe Government wants to ensure the charity beds in reforms recommended by the former Crown Prosecution Service inspector Stephen Wooler.\nOne source said ministers said they would “let Wooler’s recommendations settle down – the door is not closed”.\nThe source pointed out that the Government had deliberately said in its response to the committee there was no need to take away the powers “at this time”.\nRSPCA staff with a puppy T he Government said: “[We] do not consider, at this time, that the RSPCA should be made a specialist reporting authority. \n“Instead we believe that the RSPCA should be given the opportunity to implement the recommendations of the Wooler Review and demonstrate its commitment to responding to the concerns that have been raised by the Committee.”\nWatch | Always here for animals: RSPCA vet David Mills 02:21 T he RSPCA spends nearly £8million a year on prosecutions, a cost which would fall to taxpayers if its powers were stripped away. \nGovernment sources have made clear that the CPS would be able to take on this work load if asked to do so.\nTim Bonner, the chief executive of the Countryside Alliance, said: “We do not believe that the RSPCA can ever escape the conflicts of interest created by acting as investigator, prosecutor, political campaigning organisation and fundraiser. \nThe RSPCA rescues a gull in Newport Credit: RSPCA “That is why it specifically excluded the question of 'whether' it should continue as a prosecutor of first resort from its review of 'how' it prosecutes. \n“The Government has made it quite clear that the CPS will always prosecute where there is sufficient evidence so the RSPCA could close down this unnecessary debate by accepting the recommendation of the EFRA committee and withdrawing from its outdated role as aquatic-statutory prosecutor.”\nJ eremy Cooper, chief executive of the RSPCA, said: “We are extremely pleased that the Government continues to recognise the exceptional role carried out by the RSPCA in investigating and prosecuting those accused of the worst cases of animal cruelty and neglect.\nWatch | RSPCA seek man seen punching 'petrified' dog 00:38 “The Society has a proud history of nearly 200 years investigating and prosecuting animal welfare offences. \n“We know that the public overwhelmingly wants us to undertake this role, and we welcome the support we have to carry out our prosecutions work from vets, local authorities and other animal welfare organisations.”\nL ast February the RSPCA unveiled a major overhaul of how the charity investigates animal cruelty after years of criticism about the behaviour of one of the world’s oldest animal welfare charities. \nRSPCA inspectors were banned from rehoming animals unless vets have personally seen evidence of suffering, a new complaints line for members of the public to report allegations about RSPCA officers was set up and the charity was banned from appealing for funds in press releases announcing the outcome of court cases. \nDecisions to prosecute so-called “red coat” hunting cases were also to be made by lawyers at the Crown Prosecution Service, rather than the charity – although it reserved the right to prosecute if the CPS decides not to do so.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T00:14:16.386+02:00",
