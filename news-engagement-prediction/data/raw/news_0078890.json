Origin \nAt the 2017 Academy Awards, Jimmy Kimmel did a segment where he brought in actual Los Angeles tourists into the Oscars. He brought several to the front of the stage and introduced them to the actors. One of them, identified as Vickie from Chicago, seemed very excited to meet Ryan Gosling. When Gosling shook her hand, he leaned in and said something, and Vickie looked shocked. Spread \nImmediately after the moment, a screenshot of Gosling whispering in Vickieâ€™s ear began to circulate around Twitter with jokes that made it appear as though Gosling were delivering some bombshell information. Jokes included references to Hail Hydra , Is a Hotdog a Sandwich , The Warriors Blew a 3-1 Lead , and many more. The jokes were covered in Twitter Moments [1] and Polygon [2] the following day.
