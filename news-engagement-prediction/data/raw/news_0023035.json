The crime-fighters are right on this one. New York’s Commission on Forensic Science should authorize the use of familial DNA searching in criminal investigations. \nDNA analysis is a fixture of investigations, as it has been for decades. Though conventional police work solves most crimes, in others, especially rapes and homicides, blood, skin cells, semen or other genetic material left behind by perpetrators, when sent to a lab, can prove instrumental. \nThat’s because New York, like every other state, sees if a sample matches anyone in its state database, where the genetic profiles of 581,000 people who have been convicted of crimes are stored. \nThe miraculous innovation has put thousands of people behind bars and exonerated hundreds more. \nNow comes the question: What if police find blood, skin cells, semen or other materials — but get no match? Can they run another search to see whether someone in the database is a relative of the person they’re looking for, then use that information to get their man or woman through interviews and shoe-leather techniques? \nThe answer should be yes. \nIn California, one of 10 states that allows familial DNA analysis, the process has been in place since 2008. It led to the capture of Lonnie David Franklin Jr., who killed at least 10 young women and girls between 1985 and 2007. \nAfter evading police for years, Franklin was partly identified through the DNA of his son, who was in the state’s database. \nNYPD Deputy Chief of Forensic Science Emanuel Katranakis believes as many as 30 murders last year might have been solved if the familial DNA search had been permitted. \nCritics, including the New York Civil Liberties Union, claim that a justice system already tilted against minorities will implicate otherwise innocent people of color, simply because they are “linked” to a violent criminal. \nIt’s an overblown fear. In the small number of cases in question, a familial DNA link simply gives cops a lead worth pursuing. \nPeople implicated will be interviewed; they won’t be drawn into the net unless other evidence points in their direction. \nIt’s not dissimilar to what happens when an eyewitness identifies someone fitting a particular description in a particular place — prompting cops to interview various people who may or may not be connected with the crime. \nSecurity and privacy are not absolutes; they are values to be balanced. Bringing justice to families, and getting murderers or rapists off the street, is the higher value here.
