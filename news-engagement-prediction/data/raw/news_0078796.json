We are keenly watching it \nHyperloop is working on a technology that would use magnetic levitation in low-pressure tubes to transport people and goods at airplane-like speeds. Currently the company is involved to operationalise its product in Nevada in the US. \nTerming the Hyperloop technolgy \"very exciting\", Prabhu said \nThink of travelling to Mumbai-Delhi in just 60 minutes and Mumbai to Chennai in 30 minutes. We will closely watch it how it is happening. \nHe said Indian Railways has undertaken a massive exercise of modernisation of infrastructure and also increasing speed. \nSpeed is also our focus.
