Sport understands Mourinho was impressed by the Frenchman's versatility. \nMourinho is believed to have 'raved' about Malcuit's speed and admired the 6ft defender's presence in the St Etienne backline. Malcuit kept up with speed merchants Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Marcus Rashford last week. \nUnited are expected to sign a full-back in the summer transfer window after Matteo Darmian's and Luke Shaw's futures were plunged in further doubt. \nRight-back Darmian and left-back Shaw were both excluded from United's EFL Cup final squad against Southampton as Mourinho rewarded auxiliary full-back Ashley Young for his recent performances. Read More Mourinho has restored United's standards \nShaw, 21, has played once in the last three months and Darmian lost his place in the first-team after a struggling display against Liverpool last month. \nMalcuit has started all but six St Etienne matches at right-back this campaign and Darmian nor Timothy Fosu-Mensah have provided dependable back-up for the untouchable Antonio Valencia. \nValencia, 31, had his contract extended until summer 2018 last month and only Paul Pogba, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, David de Gea and Ander Herrera have lined-up more often than the Ecuadorian this season. \nUnited could also reinforce up front, in midfield and at centre-back ahead of next season. The club retains an interest in Atletico Madrid goalscorer Antoine Griezmann and Monaco enforcer Tiemoué Bakayoko. They have also been linked with Benfica's Victor Lindelof - although United sources distanced themselves from reports linking them with him in January. \nGet all the latest Manchester United news first with our new app. Download it here now.
