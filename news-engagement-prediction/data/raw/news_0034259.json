By Dan Gigler / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nMore than a year in the making, Union Standard by chef Derek Stevens will open to the public tomorrow. \nIt is the first major new restaurant to open in Downtown Pittsburgh in 2017 and is a centerpiece attraction to the $100 million refurbishment and modernization of the opulent Union Trust Building by the Boston-based The Davis Companies., which owns the building. \nMr. Stevens helped open Strip District restaurant Eleven and rose to be executive chef there before leaving to develop Union Standard. The menu at Union Standard focuses on whole roasted meats and vegetables, local heirloom crops and foraged native foods, with a wood-fired grill and rotisserie key components of the kitchen. There also will be a raw bar featuring oysters and chilled shellfish.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T04:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:07:55.296+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
