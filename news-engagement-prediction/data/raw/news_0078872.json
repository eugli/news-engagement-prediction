He had criticized the regime of his family and his half-brother Kim Jong Un in the past and had been living in exile, under Beijing’s protection, in the Chinese territory of Macau. \nWhile Malaysian police arrested Doan Thi Huong, the Vietnamese, and Indonesian Siti Aishah in the days after the attack, they are also holding one North Korean man and have identified seven other North Koreans wanted in connection with the sensational case. \nAttorney general Mohamed Apandi Ali said the North Korean in custody will not be charged yet. His remand period ends on Friday. \nThe security camera footage, which has been released in the media, showed two women assaulting Kim Jong Nam in the departure hall of Kuala Lumpur International Airport, and the victim stumbling into a medical clinic. He died within 20 minutes of the assault. \nBoth women have told diplomats from their countries that they had been paid to take part in what they believed was a prank for a reality TV show. \nThe attorney general said the women will be formally charged on Wednesday under section 302 of the penal code, which carries the death penalty. \n“I can confirm that,” he told Reuters in a text message. \n(Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T13:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T10:41:15.538+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
