I believe a lot of the sources are pure fiction. They just pull it out of thin air.”\nThe White House has been plagued by a deluge of leaks leading to a series of politically embarrassing stories, and it was reported that Press Secretary Sean Spicer, in an attempt to stem the flow, called a meeting with dozens of aides and searched their electronic devices. While Trump is eager to find the source – or sources – of the leaks, he disagreed with Spicer’s controversial methodology.\n“Sean Spicer is a fine human being. He’s a fine person. I would have done it differently,” Trump said. “I would have done it one-on-one.”\nHe added: “Sean handles it his way and I’m okay with it.”\nTrump said the administration had “sort of ideas” who had been leaking information.\n“We have people from other campaigns, we have people from [previous] governments,” Trump said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T14:19:25.743+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
