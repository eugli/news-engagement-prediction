Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email Sunday Brunch fans got an early morning stomach-churning surprise when one of the show’s guests licked his fingers after touching raw chicken.\nLegendary England cricket captain David Gower was helping chef Simon Rimmer make a beetroot chicken, potato and mustard salad on the Channel 4 show when he was asked to help marinade some chicken breasts.\nDavid got stuck in, slathering the chicken in the marinade, but then LICKED his fingers when he’d finished. Which is not only gross but potentially disastrous. Food prep 101: wash your hands after you touch raw meat. Especially chicken.\nDavid Gower was helping marinade a chicken breast (Photo: Channel 4) David Gower really getting stuck in there with that chicken (Photo: Channel 4) HIS HAND IS IN HIS MOUTH (Photo: Channel 4) AND NOW THE OTHER ONE (Photo: Channel 4) David, everyone saw you licking your raw chickeny fingers (Photo: Channel 4) Read More Richard Blackwood doesn't know how to zest a lemon and the internet thinks it's hilarious After David had enthusiastically licked several fingers from BOTH hands, he looked furtively to the side, presumably for something to wipe them but the damage was already done.\n“My Sunday morning has been ruined by the man on Sunday Brunch who just handled raw chicken then licked his fingers,” said one grossed-out Twitter user.\nOthers warned Dave of his impending diarrhoea, salmonella and/or a pretty dodgy stomach.\nLater in the show, chef Marianne Lumb cut her finger on a mandolin - although the official Sunday Brunch Twitter account claimed she was okay.\n“Just to reassure you guys @Marianna Lumb didn’t break her skiing when she cut herself, she’s okay! There was no blood”\nAlthough viewers insisted otherwise...\nIt's a cautionary tale for everyone.
