HC seeks govt’s opinion india Updated: Feb 27, 2017 20:05 IST PTI New Delhi A swap transplant involves an exchange of organs between two families, who cannot donate the organ to their own family member because of a blood group mismatch. (HT File Photo) \nCan a person who has no family donor be allowed to advertise to get a volunteer for a kidney transplant? \nThis is a question on which the Delhi high court on Monday sought the views of the government. \nThe issue was raised by a patient who drew the attention of the court that in case of celebrities, media attention makes it easy for them to get volunteer donors, but common citizens do not have a right to avail the benefit of advertisements. \nJustice Sanjeev Sachdeva, who is seized with the matter, asked the ministry for family health and welfare to look into various aspects of the transplantation of kidney raised by the petitioner. \nRead more: Heart covers 23km in 17 minutes for Mumbai’s 40th transplant \nThe judge also sought the views of the National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO), the apex centre for registry, procurement and distribution of organs and tissues and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on the plea of the patient who has narrated his ordeal of 15 long years. \nThe response of NOTTO was sought as the patient has prayed for scrapping of the body which maintains a registry of donations and transplantation of organs and tissues. \nThe patient, Vinod Kumar Anand, lost his kidneys and the one donated by his wife due to renal problems. \nDuring the hearing, the court asked the patient’s advocate, Ashok Aggarwal, to explore the possibility of kidney exchange between his family and that of someone else who also required the organ. \nRead more: Liver retransplant surgery saves life of alcohol addict in Noida \nKidney exchange or ‘swap’ is a simple barter system in which a swap pair consists of a recipient (patient) and a donor (a family member). \nA swap transplant involves an exchange of organs between two families, who cannot donate the organ to their own family member because of a blood group mismatch. \nThe patient, who is also a lawyer, has said in his plea The patient, who is also a lawyer, has said in his plea that he was diagnosed with renal problems in 2001 and inspite of best efforts, he lost both his kidneys. \nThereafter in 2013, his wife donated one kidney to him, but some months later he suffered acute graft dysfunction and cellular rejection which caused an urinary tract infection. \nAccording to Anand’s plea, he suffered acute graft dysfunction several times and finally in January 2016 the kidney which was donated also became non-functional and he had to depend on hemodialysis thrice a week for survival. \nHe has claimed that his efforts to find a volunteer donor have not yielded results and has sought directions to the government to amend the Transplant of Human Organs and Tissues Act 1994 to allow advertisements to find volunteer donors. \nHe has sought directions to AIIMS to issue a letter to him for finding volunteer donors through newspaper ads. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T08:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T03:40:20.396+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
