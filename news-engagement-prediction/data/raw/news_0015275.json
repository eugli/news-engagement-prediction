Many came with signs asking for a halt to the ban and a stop to hatred and racism. \nJeremiah Blanchard, 36, said his three children were the reason they came to protest. \nHis kids, who range in age from 5 to 10, made signs the Friday night, one reading \"please don't break up our family.\" \nBlanchard and his wife, who is originally from Japan, met while he studied in Japan. \n\"We've never done anything like this with protesting or anything, but the way I view it, this could have been our family,\" he said. \n\"[Our kids] wanted to come out because they know their mother isn't originally from here and they see others not being allowed to enter the country not because they did something wrong, but because of the country on their passport,\" Blanchard said. \nThe event's organizer, Paul Mifsud Jr., 20, said the event is about spreading the message of love and diversity. \n\"I've seen a lot of protests recently that had a counterproductive message,\" he said. \"We don't want that. We want this to be about uniting our community no matter what race or what religion or what skin color you have because after all, that's what our county was founded on: diversity.\" \nA federal judge in Seattle ruled late Friday that the order was unconstitutional, allowing people overseas to board flights coming to the United States. \nAfterward, the White House issued a statement calling the ruling “outrageous,” adding that they would file a stay of the ruling to counteract it. \nThis is the third weekend of protests across the country since Trump took office in January. \nchayes@orlandosentinel.com, 407-420-5493 or Twitter: @journo_christal  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T06:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:24:53.589+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
