The Tampa Bay Lightning captain paid $3.85 million in late January for a mansion on the Davis Islands waterfront, according to Hillsborough County property records. Tampa Bay Lightning's Steven Stamkos stands for a portrait at the Tampa Bay Times Forum… more Scott Audette The sellers, Constance and Michael Solomon , paid $2.05 million for the home in 2002. The home, built in 1970, is 4,851 square feet. It was listed for sale at $4.29 million, according to the Multiple Listing Service. It was recently renovated, according to the listing, and has a 60-foot dock. The listing describes the home as \"U-shaped,\" allowing for views of the bay, pool and sunsets from most rooms. It has five bedrooms and four full bathrooms. Stamkos signed an eight-year contract worth a reported $8.5 million per season with the Lightning in mid-2016. He owns another home in the Westshore Yacht Club, which does not appear to be listed for sale. Stamkos paid $750,000 for that residence in 2010, according to property records. A Lightning spokesman declined comment. Davis Islands is a popular neighborhood for Lightning players. Victor Hedman bought a house there in 2016, and Ryan Callahan bought one in 2014.
