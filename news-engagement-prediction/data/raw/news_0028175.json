Kevin Durant returns to face Oklahoma City Thunder (Getty Images) Tom Webber \nUpdated at 7:25 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 7:25 a.m. ET \nKevin Durant got a frosty reception on his return to Oklahoma City with the Golden State Warriors, but claimed he was expecting the boos to be louder. \nDurant left the Thunder in free agency after last season and made his first appearance at Chesapeake Arena since then in the Warriors' resounding 130-114 victory, scoring an impressive 34 points. \nThe 28-year-old was jeered throughout the match and faced chants of \"cupcake\" — an insult former Thunder center Kendrick Perkins frequently aimed at players who lacked toughness. \nHowever, Durant was not fazed by his reception and enjoyed being the target of hostility from fans who used to cheer him. \nWhen asked what he made of the boos by ESPN in an on-court interview, Durant said: \"I actually thought it would be a little louder, but it was fun. \n\"I was on the other side of it. To become one of these guys where now they boo you is kind of fun, so I've just got to embrace it. \n\"That's all I can do and keep playing my game and preparing the way I prepare and keep enjoying every game.\" Final: @warriors top @okcthunder 130-114. #KevinDurant : 34 PTS & 9 REB #RussellWestbrook : 47 PTS, 11 REB, & 8 AST pic.twitter.com/cIyt8GEkME — NBA (@NBA) February 12, 2017 \nDurant was involved in a fiery exchange of words with former team-mate and friend Russell Westbrook in the third quarter, before squaring up to Andre Roberson and receiving a technical foul following a review by the officials. \n\"It's part of the game and I respect that. We should have just kept playing, I don't think they should have reviewed anything. Hard fouls, s*** talking, all that stuff is part of the game and that's what makes it fun for us,\" Durant later told reporters. \n\"Basketball is fun in general especially when you play in an environment like this. The crowd was amazing tonight, as loud as I ever heard them here.\" \nWhen asked if he was surprised by Durant's reception, Westbrook said: \"No, I wasn't.\" \nThe Thunder star, who ended the match two assists shy of a 47-point triple-double, believes too much is made of his relationship with Durant, which dominated the build-up. \n\"It doesn't make any sense, it's over with,\" Westbrook said. \"He plays for his team, I play for my team. Let him do his thing, I do my thing, that's it, plain and simple.\" Watch This", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T19:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T14:43:03.873+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
