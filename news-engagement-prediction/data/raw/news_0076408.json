RICKY WILSON/FAIRFAX NZ \nKaikoura Labour candidate Janette Walker, left, and Labour deputy leader Annette King on the banks of the Taylor River. \nEnvironment Minister Nick Smith announced on Thursday a plan to make 90 per cent of rivers and lakes around New Zealand 'swimmable' by 2040. \nREAD MORE: * Decision time for dirty river \nHowever, the proposal has been slammed by environmental groups, who have accused the Government of shifting the goal posts around what 'swimmable' means. \nAt present, the 'A Grade' for rivers is 260 E coli per 100 millimetres of water or less. \nBut to qualify as 'swimmable' under the new guidelines, they have to meet the threshold of 540 E coli per 100ml of water at least 80 per cent of the time. \nMinistry of Health guidelines state if you swim somewhere with an E coli level of 550 per 100ml, there is a one in 20 chance of contracting campylobacter. \nMarlborough District Council figures show the Taylor River exceeded that limit five times between November and March last year, and three times this summer. Ad Feedback \nBut its water quality was still rated 'fair' - the lowest 'swimmable' grading - on a new map released by the Ministry for the Environment to coincide with the policy announcement. \nKaikoura Labour candidate Janette Walker accused Smith of shifting the goal posts, describing the Taylor River as a perfect example of the contradictions of the new policy. \n\"According to the local council it's not swimmable, it's full of duck s*** and dog s*** - anyone who wants to go for a swim in the Taylor River is taking their life into their own hands,\" she said. \nCouncil senior environmental scientist Peter Hamill said out of the nine rivers council monitored for recreational use, the Taylor River had the worst water quality. \n\"The Taylor River is clearly the one that has the most issues with recreational use, and that's hardly surprising - urban waters are always at risk due to human activities,\" he said. \nThis was down to a combination of factors, including earthquake damage to sewer pipes, which leached into storm water feeding into the river. \nAssets and services staff were examining the sewerage network using cameras to check for cracks, which would be fixed to stop any future leaching, Hamill said. \nFecal matter from ducks and other animals was also behind the levels of E coli in the river, which was usually higher during periods of low water flow. \nHowever, aside from the Taylor River, Hamill said rivers in the region were largely in good shape, and the council would not have to change much to comply with the new policy. \nA Ministry for the Environment report released on the proposal said 94 per cent of rivers and lakes in Marlborough were already considered 'swimmable'. \nThis was the third highest in the country, behind Nelson on 96 per cent, and the West Coast with 99 per cent. Northland was the lowest, with only 29 per cent rated 'swimmable'. \n\"We're in a great position, we just have to continue with our monitoring programme which is about ensuring our water quality is as good as possible,\" Hamill said. \nThe council was also adopting more stringent rules around water quality through its proposed Marlborough Environment Plan. \nOne of the objectives in the plan was to make sure recreational swimming spots in rivers were under the E coli threshold of 540 per 100ml of water 95 per cent of the time. - The Marlborough Express ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T08:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T03:59:22.511+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
