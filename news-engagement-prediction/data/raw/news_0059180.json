If it had survived, it could have helped make even faster computers and create more efficient cars and other electronic devices. It would have also saved much of the power that is lost in transmission, making the world more energy efficient. \nSo what happened to the new metal? \nScientists claim it may have been lost in the machinery or that it could have eventually melted at room temperature. But others are not so convinced, and some physicists say that the team never actually turned hydrogen into metal. \nReports say that the sample was kept wedged between two tiny diamonds at -460°F and at a pressure equivalent to that of the center of the Earth. \nProfessor Isaac Silvera of Harvard University stated that one of the diamonds was crushed into a fine powder while he was trying to monitor the metallic hydrogen using a low-intensity laser. He heard a click as it disintegrated. \nOddly enough, there is no trace of the metallic hydrogen ever having been there in the first place. \nSome skeptics say that the scientists may believe they created the matter, but actually did not. But Silvera remains firm in his claim that his team did actually turn metal into hydrogen, it has simply been lost. \nHe told The Independent: \n“The sample is in the wreckage some place or it’s not meta-stable and it disappeared, it turned into a gas. If it was meta-stable and if it could withstand the shock of a catastrophic failure, it would still be in the gasket.” \nIf the hydrogen did turn into gas, this would be a major setback in the creation of the matter, as it would prove that what the scientists created could not withstand the Earth’s atmosphere and therefore would not revolutionize electricity as they had originally hoped.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:42:35.419+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
