The Sussan Ley expenses scandal has reignited calls for tougher restrictions on politicians' entitlements â€” but what are they? \n\"I think that is [self] serving.\" \nHe also argued the \"revolving door of prime ministers\" had not served the country well and his amendment would go some way towards \"cleaning up Canberra\". \n\"The respect for the office of prime minister has been trashed,\" he said. \n\"I do not know why anybody who serves for less than four years in the job of prime minister should receive access to a gold pass. \n\"It will stop the Hunger Games, if you will, for people who say, 'look at me, I managed to become prime minister', for 12 months or whatever, before they are turfed out by their own side.\" \nUnder the current rules, former prime ministers are entitled to a lifetime of free travel in retirement as well as other expenses including car costs, staff, an office and telecommunications. \nThe opaque and confusing parliamentary entitlements system was once again in the spotlight earlier this year after Sussan Ley was forced to resign as health minister following a travel expenses scandal. \nIt prompted the Prime Minister to promise an overhaul of the existing system and set up an independent body to monitor and adjudicate on MPs expenses. \nSenator Bernardi said if the Government were serious about bringing the system into line with public expectations, then it should do \"the full job\" and include former prime ministers in its crackdown.
