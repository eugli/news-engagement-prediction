Now, a number of publications have came to the conclusion that Rooney will leave the club in the coming days. \nThe Mirror have gone with a the back page splash 'Goodbye Rooney Tuesday', because the Chinese Super League closes on, you guessed it, Tuesday. \nThe above states that Rooney will become the world's best player, with a weekly salary in the region of Â£750,000-a-week being thrown around. \nWhile The Telegraph report that Wayne Rooney's record breaking move will depend on whether he plays in the EFL final on Sunday. Wayne Rooney's move to the Chinese Super League could hinge on whether he's picked for the #EFLCupFinal https://t.co/ltn4tTcfO8 - Telegraph Football (@TeleFootball) February 21, 2017 \nHowever, of all the Chinese Super League clubs Rooney could potentially end up at, we can rule out Fabio Cannavaro's Tianjin Quanjin. \nThe legendary Italian defender, who has assembled a squad that contains familiar names such as Gervinho, Alexandre Pato and Axel Witsel, confirmed that the club had made an enquiry about Rooney but doesn't feel as though United's all-time top scorer would fit their style of play. \nHe's yet to reveal whether or not Rooney's Twitter presence has played a part in his decision. \nHere are some of the best tweets the England skipper has conjured up: \nHe says Tianjin have spoke more regularly with the representatives of Borussia Dortmund striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. \nSpeaking to TianjinTV , the 2006 Ballon d'Or winner said: \n\"We did make an approach for Rooney, but it was just a chat because he simply doesn't suit our style of play. \n\"No further discussion was necessary. The truth is we had more frequent contact with Aubameyang.\" \nThe Chinese Super League transfer window closes next Tuesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T13:13:47.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
