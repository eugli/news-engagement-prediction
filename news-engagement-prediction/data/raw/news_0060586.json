I won’t give you the already-exhausted Trump-era culture argument, that we need this writer now more than ever. Instead, I’ll give you this one: Reading Wright is a steep, stinging pleasure, and pleasure will be the guiding principle behind the undersung American books I’ll be speaking about twice a month in this new column. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story It’s an apt moment to talk about Wright, as well, because of the deserved success of Paul Beatty’s breakthrough novel, “The Sellout” (2015). It’s possible to draw a crooked line between Wright’s insolent and melancholy novels and Beatty’s own. Indeed, Beatty is a fan of Wright’s work. The comedy, in each of these writers’ novels, comes backloaded with pain. The laughter each writer provokes catches in your throat. Their African-American characters confront America’s shattered promises regarding race and progress and, as often as not, end up grinning and shaking their heads in disbelief. Life for them is, to borrow a phrase from the critic Albert Murray, “one hog ass thing after the other.” Wright’s books — they were republished by HarperCollins in 1993 in an omnibus edition under the title “Absolutely Nothing to Get Alarmed About” — will not be for everyone. They are essentially plotless. They bristle with pimps and drug dealers and all-American hustlers of every variety. They were composed before the era of political correctness, and their social targets are free-range and multiform. They’re each about a lonely young man, a fan of Billie Holiday and Langston Hughes and F. Scott Fitzgerald, adrift in the big melancholy city. He has dreams of becoming a writer, but for now he’s holed up in cheap apartments or cockroach-filled hotels, working as a bike messenger or a dishwasher or, though he doesn’t identify as gay, allowing older gay men to pay him for sex. Photo Credit Sonny Figueroa/The New York Times In “The Messenger,” he gives this account of one moment in his workday: “As I walked through the concourse of the RCA building, sneezing and reading Lawrence Durrell, dead drunk from the explosion of his words, I suddenly looked up and encountered the long face of Steven Rockefeller. He seemed startled. Doesn’t he think poor people read?” The primal subject of Wright’s novels is loneliness. As a light-skinned black man, his narrator feels like a minority tucked inside a minority. But his solitary nature was baked in at birth. About certain Sunday mornings in Manhattan, the author reports: “The shameful, envious, eyes-lowered glances at passing couples. You recognize other solitary fellow travelers. Both of you go separate ways, moving with the knowledge of Sunday papers, endless cigarettes, tap water, the hoarded half-pint, and the feeling of having missed out on Saturday night’s jackpot prize.” The jackpot prize among Wright’s novels is probably “The Wig.” It’s his most fully realized book, a frazzled picaresque about a young black man who, sensing he needs a gimmick to make it in the white world, employs an economy-size jar of hair relaxer (“the red, white, and gold label guarantees that the user can go deep-sea diving, emerge from the water, and shake his head triumphantly like any white boy”) to achieve what he calls “the wig.” Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
