And by all-time, we mean modern era, from 1970-2017. There were greats in this state before 1970, such as Lincoln’s Wade Halbrook, but there aren’t many people who have witnessed both eras, so it’s not fair to compare. \nWe don’t think there is a player among the current crop worthy of top 25 consideration, but perhaps you disagree. Here is a list we developed a year ago, after talking to a dozen long-time coaches, of the state’s all-time top 25, after current Oregon Duck Payton Pritchard led West Linn to its fourth consecutive state title. Randy Rasmussen 25. RAY BLUME, PARKROSE \nIt was a different era back in the mid-1970s, when the 6-foot-4 Blume played center for Parkrose, earning all-state honors in 1977. Yet Blume went on to college and played guard at Oregon State, where he paired with Grant's Mark Radford to form an elite backcourt tandem and eventually had a brief NBA career. Blume played at Parkrose during a time when the Broncos were one of the state's elite programs. File 24. A.D. SMITH, CHURCHILL \nChurchill is one of the state's most unsung basketball programs of the past 20 years. But the Lancers have played in state championship games four times since 1995, the year the 6-8 Smith led Churchill to the 4A state title, then Oregon's big-school classification. Smith, a three-time all-leaguer, was player of the year in 1995, and didn't have to go far for college, as he had a storied career at Oregon. File 24. A.D. SMITH, CHURCHILL 23. DAVE IMMEL, GLENCOE \nLike Smith, Immel was instrumental in leading Glencoe to a 24-1 record and the 1983 AAA state title, the Crimson Tide's only appearance in a boys basketball state final. The 6-foot-4 Immel was the state's player of the year, and ended up with a solid college career at UCLA. Immel's college choice at that time was a bit controversial, as most, if not all of Oregon's top players stayed at home, with Oregon State cooking during the early 1980s.
