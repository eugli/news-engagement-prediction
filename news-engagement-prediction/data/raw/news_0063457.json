Clemson QB Deshaun Watson   9:27 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 9:27 p.m. ET \nMyles Garrett isn’t the only NFL draft prospect pleading the Cowboys to draft him. \nFormer Clemson quarterback Deshaun Watson was in Fort Worth, Texas, to accept an award at the Davey O’Brien awards ceremony on Monday, and during his speech, Watson jokingly begged the Cowboys to draft him. \nMORE: Mock Draft | NFL Combine 2017 \n“I like being back in Fort Worth, Texas. I told you I would be back here. I told coach Garrett if I’m back here, you have to draft me,” Watson told the audience, via the Star-Telegram . “I know there are a lot of Dallas Cowboys fans. Tony Romo is healthy. Dak, I’m a huge fan. Love that man. Had the privilege to get to know him this year.

They need two.” \nSorry, Deshaun. Not a chance in hell. \nWatch Watson's humorous plea below.
