Some allies, including in Europe, provide crucial intelligence to the United States and have sought assurances that their collaboration will not result in prisoners’ being sent to Guantánamo. The naval prison and the documented abuses that occurred there in the early years of the Bush administration have led to international condemnation and are recruiting symbols for terrorist groups. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Little is publicly known about Mr. Khaybar, who is believed to be Sudanese. Former intelligence officials say he has longstanding ties to Al Qaeda and was affiliated with the terrorist organization when he lived in Sudan. At some point, he made his way to Somalia and then Yemen around 2015, officials said. Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists. Learn More After his capture, Mr. Khaybar’s identity was not immediately established. But eventually intelligence officials determined his name and F.B.I. agents pushed to prosecute him in New York. Some officials said they hoped to transfer him before the end of the Obama administration, but the complexity of the case and the review process made it impossible. Along with Mr. Trump, the case will be a test for Mr. Sessions, who has inherited a Justice Department that has become accustomed to winning important cases against foreign terrorists in federal court. The F.B.I. has been working alongside commandos from the military’s Joint Special Operations Command to collect evidence, a partnership that prosecutors say gives the United States options. And prosecutors have won cooperation from admitted terrorists, such as Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, then used that information to prosecute others and launch drone strikes. “Given the varied nature of the threats we face today, our military needs every reliable tool we can provide them,” said Brendan R. McGuire, the former chief of the terrorism unit at the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan and now a partner at WilmerHale. Under the Obama administration, the Justice Department successfully prosecuted Osama bin Laden’s son-in-law and a Pakistani-born Qaeda member who planned to carry out a bombing in Manchester, England. In 2014, a Russian jihadist fighting for the Taliban was sentenced to life in prison in the first example of a foreign combatant captured on the battlefield in Afghanistan being prosecuted in federal court. As a senator, Mr. Sessions criticized that strategy because it gave terrorism suspects the right to lawyers, the right to remain silent and the right to a speedy trial. All of those make it harder for interrogators to extract intelligence, he said. But Mr. Sessions has some wiggle room in the Khaybar case. He has said that foreign terrorists should be treated as prisoners of war “at least initially” and then a decision could be made later “as to whether to move them in federal court.” Mr. Khaybar has been held for months in Yemen, where he is likely subject to questioning by local authorities. The extent of such questioning is unclear. A third option, beside Guantánamo or criminal court, would be to not seek his transfer and allow another government to handle his case. That would be an unusual move for a case involving charges in American courts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T09:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:43:59.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
