The report of a redraft comes from Joe Scarborough of MSNBC, who cited unnamed sources, so, as always, the information must be taken with a grain of salt. Here is what Scarborough told viewers earlier this morning: \n“I’ve heard from several sources that the White House is right now working on redrafting an executive order but want to make sure that it is tight enough to pass.” \nMeanwhile, Trump once again blasted the 9th Circuit's \"disgraceful decision\" over Twitter early this morning: LAWFARE: \"Remarkably, in the entire opinion, the panel did not bother even to cite this (the) statute.\" A disgraceful decision! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 10, 2017 \n\nThe President's tweet references the following excerpt from a blog post on Lawfare which criticizes the 9th Circuit's 29-page opinion that didn't even bother to cite the statute granting the President fairly broad and unilateral authority to restrict immigration at his own discretion. \nThis case is about two big questions, only one of which the panel’s per curiam today even mentions. The first question is how broad the president’s authority is to limit admissions from the relevant seven countries—and to what extent that authority is limited by constitutional law—under a statute that gives him the sweeping power to do this: \n(f) Suspension of entry or imposition of restrictions by President Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate. \n\nRemarkably, in the entire opinion, the panel did not bother even to cite this statute, which forms the principal statutory basis for the executive order (see Sections 3(c), 5(c), and 5(d) of the order). That’s a pretty big omission over 29 pages, including several pages devoted to determining the government’s likelihood of success on the merits of the case. \nScarborough's reporting this morning came after he released a tweet storm last night calling for a redraft of the controversial executive order while also blasting the 9th Circuit's decision. This immigration EO was a disaster from the start. The president should start over, have agencies draft it more narrowly, and sign it. \n— Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) February 9, 2017 Yep. This is Miller and Bannon's handy work. The White House should redraft the order relying the interagency process this time. https://t.co/IGHquzdQcK \n— Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) February 10, 2017 Regardless of what you think of Trump, Bannon, or this order, the Ninth's decision is constitutionally weak. Trump needs to draft a new EO. \n— Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) February 10, 2017 I hate the White House EO. But this court order is ridiculous. \n— Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) February 10, 2017 I've read the Ninth's decision. They're lucky they won't have to read Justice Scalia's reversal of their opinion. It would be brutal. \n— Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) February 10, 2017 \n\nOf course, Trump seemed to be ready for an immediate fight last night tweeting in all caps: \"SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!\" SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017 \n\nFor those interested, we wrote a very thorough review of the 9th Circuit's decision last night (see \" Court Of Appeals Unanimously Rejects Trump's Travel Ban: Full Ruling \"). Here is the summary of the court's decision: \n\"We hold that the government has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits of its appeal , nor has it shown that failure to enter a stay would cause irreparable injury, and we therefore deny its emergency motion for a stay.\" \n\nThe three-judge panel hearing the case included Judges William C. Canby Jr., a Jimmy Carter appointee; Richard R. Clifton, a George W. Bush appointee; and Michelle T. Friedland, a Barack Obama appointee. \n\n\"Rather than present evidence to explain the need for the Executive Order, the Government has taken the position that we must not review its decision at all. We disagree,\" they wrote. \n\n\"In short, although courts owe considerable deference to the President's policy determinations with respect to immigration and national security, it is beyond question that the federal judiciary retains the authority to adjudicate constitutional challenges to executive action.\" \nThat Gorsuch confirmation can't come soon enough for the Trump administration.
