When challenged over the discrepancy, Tesco staff honoured the shelf price offer, however trading standards say that was not good enough. Martin Fisher, from the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, said: ‘If customer A has come back and complained and been refunded that doesn’t mean there weren’t 20 other customers who didn’t spot it and didn’t complain.’ One member of staff captured on film said there were not enough people to remove offer labels that are out of date. She said: ‘It’s called short staffed. They’ve cut the department in half.’ Jars of Chicken Tonight sauce marked £1 on the shelf were also charged at £1.79 In some cases, staff failed to remove out-of-date labels from the shelves even after being warned that the offer prices were wrong. At a Tesco Express in Birmingham, one out-of-date offer price was still on display a month after the error was first pointed out. Mr Fisher said: ‘That is very bad. It’s pretty basic that if one customer has shown something wrong then it’s put right to stop other customers being misled. ‘The longer the offer is wrong the bigger the failure of diligence and the more worried I am frankly.’ At a Tesco Express in Birmingham, one out-of-date offer price was still on display a month after the error was first pointed out He said customers were being misled so alarm bells should be ringing. ‘If there are too many offers changing too frequently so store staff cannot understand them and comply with all the changes that is something Tesco head office needs to think about,’ he added. Tesco has promised to double-check the accuracy of the price labels at all its 3,500 stores as a result of the investigation. A spokesman said: ‘We take great care to deliver clear and accurate price labels for our customers so they can make informed decisions on the products they buy. ‘We are disappointed that errors occurred and will be working with the stores involved to reinforce our responsibilities to our customers.’ Share or comment on this article 18", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T10:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T07:15:21.667+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
