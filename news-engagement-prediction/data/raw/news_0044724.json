For 200 years, only members of the royal family and the Hereditary Grand Falconer were allowed to ride alongside the Aviary in carriages. Until 1828, all others had to walk (hence the name). \nTaken from National Geographic London Book of Lists: The City's Best, Worst, Oldest, Greatest, and Quirkiest (National Geographic Books; ISBN 978-1-4262-1382-3; $19.95) by Tim Jepson and Larry Porges.
