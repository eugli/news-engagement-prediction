He was 64. \nIn a statement released Monday, Vaughn Broadnax, Starfish's board chair, called Kizer an \"inspired leader with a relentless drive to help others.\" \nWhile saddened by Kizer's death, Broadnax said the organization will honor him by continuing to work to change the lives of of Indianapolis youth. \n\"His vision for a better community was rooted in the belief that education was key,\" Broadnax said in the statement. \"He put every ounce of his being into the Starfish mission to inspire, encourage and prepare economically disadvantaged students for college and career success.\" Facebook | @Starfish Initiative It is with a heavy heart that we announce the ... \nFour years ago, Kizer began mentoring a Starfish Scholar named DeShawn, who last month accepted a full-ride scholarship to the University of Chicago, according to the organization. \nRobin Elmerick, the organization's corporate relations director, will serve as interim president and CEO. \n\"To say that Bob left big shoes to fill would be an understatement,\" Elmerick told IndyStar Monday. \"During his time as acting CEO, Starfish Initiative was fortunate to have his guidance and leadership, but more importantly, his vision. Bob saw firsthand the power that the Starfish program had to shape the lives of those that we serve.\" \nElmerick said she doesn't know when the search will begin for a new president and CEO, but a search committee has been put into place. \nShe said she considered Kizer a mentor. \n\"The lessons I learned from him, both directly and from watching him in action will serve me well as I work diligently to carry on his legacy,\" she said. \nA memorial service will be held at 4 p.m. Feb. 25 at Emmanuel Methodist Church, 16000 Cumberland Road in Noblesville. \nIn lieu of flowers, Kizer's family asks that donations be made in his honor to Starfish Initiative.
