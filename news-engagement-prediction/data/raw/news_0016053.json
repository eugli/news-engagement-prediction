The two new Technics turntables sit below the SL-1200G , which went on sale last year for £2999, and is only available in silver. \nThe 1200GR and 1210GR share the same specifications, with the only difference being the choice of finish. \nThe Technics SL-1200GR (left) and the Technics SL-1210GR (right) \nThe Technics GR turntables sport a high-rigidity, two-layer design chassis, with an aluminium platter and BMC base. By contrast, the more expensive SL-1200G has a brass platter. \nThere's a coreless direct-drive, single rotor motor, as opposed to the twin rotor found on the more expensive model. The platter weighs in at 2.5kg which, along with its aluminium-and-rubber construction, is designed to eliminate resonance. The turntables claim a torque of 3.3kg/cm and come with a low-mass, high-rigidity aluminium tonearm that's assembled, fitted and balanced by hand. MORE: Technics explains what's so good about the £3000 SL-1200G turntable More after the break \nThere are detachable cables on the SL-1200GR and SL-1210GR, a first for a Technics deck, plus gold-plated phono- and grounding terminals. The familiar +/-8 pitch controls (with a 2x option) are of course present and correct. The SL-1200GR weighs 11.2kg, while the platter is 2.5kg (including the rubber mat) – 0.8kg heavier than that of the previous SL-1200MK5 . This compares to 18kg and 3.6kg for the reference SL-1200G.

But will you be queueing up for the new £1299 SL-1210GR? Or indeed the SL-1200GR? Black or silver?
