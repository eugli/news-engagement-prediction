Photo: Vanity Fair Mexico \nFollowing the news that upmarket department store Nordstrom are ghosting the Ivanka Trump brand , Mrs Trump, or her lawyers, have invoked the age-old adage: When life hands you lemons, litigate. Or: If you can't beat 'em or be a brand ambassador, sue 'em. @shannoncoulter Yes, we still have inventory on hand, so customers will continue to see product until it sells through. â€” Nordstrom (@Nordstrom) February 4, 2017 \nEthics pundits were shocked to learn of her ambitions considering the role of wife to the President has traditionally been one of public service. However, if his two other marriages are any indication, the role of Mrs Trump is \"tycoon in training\". \nIvana Trump was essential to the aspiring real estate mogul in the 1980s and worked as an interior design consultant on several projects including the family's compound and most famous asset, Trump Tower in New York. She also held executive positions on a number of other hotels in his portfolio before she won a $20 million divorce settlement as Trump was teetering on bankruptcy in the early 1990s. She then went on to publish a best-selling separation manual that encouraged divorcees to \"take his wallet to the cleaners\". \nMistress turned wife No.2, Marla Maples , was an aspiring actor and pageant queen who released a Jane Fonda-inspired work out video titled Journey to Fitness that \"combines stretching, muscle shaping, and mental conditioning\". She was offered about $2 million to pose for Playboy , something Trump encouraged, however she declined. Fast forward to January 2017 and reports began surfacing that Maples and her daughter, Tiffany Trump, were scouting for hair and make-up artists to tend to them for free for inauguration events in exchange for \"exposure\" . \nSince Trump decided to apply for the position of leader of the free world, his third wife Melania has remained tight-lipped about, well, anything, which has turned the 46-year-old former model and mother into a human projection screen. \nThe #FreeMelania meme is widely popular, gifs of her steely expression when her husband turns his back are more popular than cat videos on the internet and countless op-eds have been dedicated to her and what she'll do next. This is despite the fact that all she's publicly pledged so far is saying her husband \"will win\" at the Liberty Ball , that she'll tackle cyber bullying at some stage during her term and, way back in 2000, she mused that being first lady is something every woman aspires to be. \"Why not?,\" she told GQ . \nFormer first ladies haven't helped with this pile on. \nMichelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, Jacqueline Kennedy and Eleanor Roosevelt were considered the Wonder Woman to their husband's Superman by using the East Wing as a vehicle to promote social causes and awareness of important issues like women's rights, education, childhood obesity and pill box hats. \nWhile eminent commentators such as The New York Times' Maureen Dowd were opining that Mrs Trump is shaking up the FLOTUS role by not \"playing by the rules\" , it appears, in light of this new lawsuit, the subject was doing just that by sitting in the first family's gilded penthouse apartment in New York plotting her business empire instead of planning the White House's annual Easter Egg roll. \nIf the vote went the other way would Bill Clinton be planning elaborate White House events that DC insiders say \"are among the heaviest tasks for first ladies\"?
