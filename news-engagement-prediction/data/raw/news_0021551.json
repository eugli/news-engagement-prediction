Suárez was shown a harsh second yellow card late on for what was deemed an elbow on Atlético’s Koke but the visitors could not force extra-time, with the game finishing 1-1 on the night.\nLionel Messi gives Barcelona edge over Atlético Madrid in Copa del Rey Read more \nEarlier Antoine Griezmann had a goal wrongly disallowed for offside when Atlético had the extra man and Lionel Messi hit the bar with a free-kick during a dramatic second half.\nBarcelona will now meet either Alaves or Celta Vigo in the final, with those sides playing the second leg of their semi-final tie on Wednesday. Suárez and Roberto will both miss the final.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:54:56.459+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
