Andrew Kelly / Reuters \n(Reuters) - A Powerball ticket sold in Indiana matched the winning numbers of a drawing on Wednesday for the game’s $435 million jackpot, one of the largest in the lottery’s history. \nThe numbers drawn were 52, 10, 61, 28, and 13. The Powerball was 2. The winning ticket in Indiana is worth $435 million, the seventh-largest jackpot in the game’s history, according to the lottery’s website. \nBefore Wednesday, the last time a winning ticket in the jackpot was sold was on Dec. 17. The odds of winning the jackpot were 1 in 292,201,338. \nPowerball’s jackpot swelled to a record $1.6 billion in January 2016, when three winning tickets were sold in Florida, California, and Tennessee. The game and a second major U.S. lottery, Mega Millions, have exceeded $400 million only a few other times. \nPowerball tickets are sold in 44 states, as well as Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Players can buy the $2 tickets with their own numbers or have the numbers randomly generated by a computer. \nHalf of Powerball sales goes to prizes, 40 percent to state governments for items such as education and 10 percent to retailers who sell the tickets and for other administrative costs.
