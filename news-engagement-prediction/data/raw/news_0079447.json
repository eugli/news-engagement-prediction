Ma O Rañada Aplasca, the former director of the PNP Aviation Security Group, has been assigned as the new police director of the Calabarzon (Cavite-Laguna-Batangas-Rizal-Quezon) region. \nIn a press statement on Sunday, Supt. Chitadel Gaoiran, public information officer of the Police Regional Office 4 PRO 4, said Aplasca, a member of PMA “Hinirang” Class of 1987, replaced Chief Supt. Valfrie Tabian who retired on Feb. 24. \nPRO 4 is based in Camp Vicente Lim in Canlubang town in Laguna province. ADVERTISEMENT \nAfter his assumption into office on Friday, Gaoiran said Aplasca issued three marching orders to Calabarzon policemen and officers: “inspire and provide guidance and direction to all the units and personnel”; “encourage the performers and give reminders and redirection to the laggards and non-conformists” and “impose disciplinary actions to those who continue and insist not to conform.” \n“To my fellow police officers, I enjoin all of you to aspire for what is noble, to aim for the higher calling of our profession and to render reputable and decent public service. Let us remember our sworn duty to serve and protect,” Gaoiran quoted Aplasca. \nTabian served as PRO-4 director for more than eight months and was acknowledged for his numerous accomplishments particularly in the government’s war on illegal drugs.
