Just run, run, run,\" the same member says, seeing a man flee the house with the large bag. \n\"Oh, it’s all going down, oh s---!\" \nA police officer notices the man and gives chase, with the squatter subsequently dropping the drugs so he could make a getaway. \nThe police officer picks up the bag, then pulls out his truncheon and a can of pepper spray, apparently fearing he may be attacked – and rightly so. One of the anarchist squatters dropped the bag of drugs he was attempting to steal (Image: SWNS) \nSadly, his fears come to fruition when he was punched in the face by one of the anarchists. \n\"An officer posted at the scene chased the suspect who subsequently dropped the bag and made off,\" Scotland Yard said in a statement. \n\"The officer recovered the evidence bag but was surrounded by a group of people and was assaulted sustaining a facial injury.\" \n\"Fortunately the officer did not require hospital treatment.\" \nThree people were arrested attempting to flee the property on Friday and were charged with cultivating cannabis.' \nThe vision filmed indicates they were members of an anarchist group who were occupying a squat across the road. \nThe Autonomous Nation of Anarchist Libertarians had been evicted from another squat in Eaton Square earlier this month. \n\"There has been no arrest regarding the theft of evidence or the assault on police,\" Scotland Yard said. \nMore than 600 cannabis plants were found on the property. © Nine Digital Pty Ltd 2017 TRENDING VIDEO 9RAW: Ice wall collapses next to climber February 20, 2017: A climber has filmed an ice wall which he was ascending collapse next to him, narrowly escaping from falling debris.
