(Amy Davis, Baltimore Sun video) \nA rally for education funding takes place at Lawyer's Mall. (Amy Davis, Baltimore Sun video) \nUnder Lawrence, St. Vincent has been devoted to service to the poor, allowing the homeless to sleep in the church's adjacent park, orchestrating giant Friday night dinners for the hungry and helping people transition out of poverty and homelessness. He told church members that his legacy will depend on their continued service work after he leaves. \nLawrence hasn't shied away from controversy, taking a stand in support of Maryland's 2012 ballot referendum that eventually legalized same-sex marriage, despite the Baltimore Archdiocese's strong opposition to the law. At the time, the pastor read Archbishop William E. Lori 's letter against the referendum to his congregation, then told his parishioners he hoped one day the church \"could come to recognize the total, exclusive and permanent union of gay and lesbian couples as part of the sacrament of matrimony.\" \nThe archbishop recognized Lawrence's service to the homeless with the permanent placement of a sculpture known as Homeless Jesus at the church and a letter to the priest and his church on Sunday. \n\"Long before the election of Pope Francis, Father Lawrence spoke of accompaniment, and he lived it out daily in his priestly ministry, as seen most publicly by his care for the homeless and hungry of Baltimore,\" Lori wrote. \"In his priestly service, he made it a priority to serve others in the image and example of Jesus.\" \nLori called it \"a rare gift\" for a priest to have such a long history with his parish. \nAn aide delivered another congratulatory letter to Lawrence, this one from retired Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski, praising the priest's work as a \"powerful example of the necessity of mercy in our lives.\" \n\"You are a Baltimore original, a national treasure and brought the Beatitudes to us every day,\" Mikulski wrote in a handwritten note at the bottom of the typed letter. \nJim Casey, 64, of Charles Village said Lawrence had a talent for delivering \"phenomenal sermons.\" \nCasey, a 30-year St. Vincent parishioner, said he had studied to be a priest himself before leaving the seminary. He said he found what he'd been looking for with Lawrence. \n\"He's the best preacher I've ever heard,\" he said. \nAnother parishioner, Harold \"Howdy\" Burns, 67, of Lutherville, said he'd been raised Catholic but had stopped attending church, except for the sacraments. That all changed 35 years ago, when he first heard Lawrence preach. \n\"I wouldn't be Catholic without Dick,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T01:50:43.320+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
