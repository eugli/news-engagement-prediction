Additionally, Baylor police were alleged to have concealed files and failed to properly investigate cases that were reported. Baylor president Ken Starr was first reassigned before resigning, and athletic director Ian McCaw left the program as well. \nIn a separate Title IX lawsuit filed in January, additional claims were made that there had been 52 acts of rape committed by 31 different Baylor football players between 2011 and 2014. \nGutierrez plans to hold a press conference on Monday to discuss the resolution.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T08:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T03:26:26.207+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
