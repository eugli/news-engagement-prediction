She endured years of rape in prison and won a lawsuit against the state. Pruitt is one of about 350 Michigan prisoners who will be resentenced. CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nJennifer Pruitt, a teenager convicted of murder who later endured years of rape in prison while serving a life sentence, will learn next month when she will be eligible for parole. \nOakland County Circuit Judge Martha Anderson listened to more than an hour of pleadings this afternoon but didn't issue a new sentence, instead saying she wanted to take it under advisement and release her decision March 2. \nRelated: Michigan courts wrestle with resentencings \nOakland County prosecutors requested a 40-60 year sentence, meaning Pruitt would be eligible for parole in 15 years. Pruitt's lawyer, Robyn Frankel, asked for 25 years, which would make Pruitt eligible for parole later this year because of the 24 years she's already served. \nPruitt is entitled to a new sentence under a pair of U.S. Supreme Court rulings that made life sentences without parole unconstitutional when they are applied to people who committed their crimes as juveniles. \nAnderson's courtroom was packed with family members of Elmer Heichel, the 75-year-old Pontiac man who was stabbed to death in 1992. Pruitt and a friend went to his home late one night to rob him and he let them in because he knew her. Pruitt later said she walked out of the bathroom to find her accomplice, Donnell Miracle, stabbing him, but she didn't stop the attack. \nHeichel's granddaughter, Kimberly Gaynett, said the family was disappointed by the sentencing delay because they've been anguished over the possible release of woman they were told years ago would never be released. \n\"It's just really hard,\" Gaynett said. \"We were told years ago, life without parole, and now we have to live through this again.\" Buy Photo \nKimberly Gaynett, of Clarkston speaks on behalf of her family during a re-sentencing hearing for Jennifer Pruitt, 41, of Pontiac in front of Oakland County Circuit Judge Martha Anderson for her role in a 1992 robbery gone bad that led to the murder of Gaynett's 75-year-old grandfather, Elmer Heichel, on Thurs., Feb. 9, 2017 at the Oakland County Courthouse in Pontiac. (Photo: Ryan Garza, Detroit Free Press) \nGaynett said her mother, who was rolled into the courtroom in a wheelchair, is in hospice care in Florida and struggled to make the trip for this resentencing. Her health won't allow her to make the trip again next month, Gaynett said. \nGaynett pleaded with Anderson to issue the maximum sentence, noting that her grandfather had been kind to Pruitt, paying her to do odd jobs around his home and even welcoming her at his 75th birthday party just weeks before he was killed. \n\"She called him grandpa,\" Gaynett said, adding that as he was being killed, Heichel called out to Pruitt for help and she refused. \nEarlier: \n\"Not only did my grandfather have to suffer a painful death, but he also looked into your eyes, Jennifer Pruitt,\" Gaynett said. \"Did he die knowing that Jennifer Pruitt was the one who betrayed him.\" \nGaynett said whatever progress Pruitt has made in prison, she's never apologized to the Heichel family. \nPruitt tried to remedy that by apologizing as part of her statement to the court. \n\"I am so, so sorry that I caused the death of an innocent man,\" Pruitt said. \"I'm deeply ashamed of what I've done and the harm I've inflicted on Mr. Heichel and his family. I pray that the Heichel family can have peace and serenity in their hearts and that Mr. Heichel can rest in peace.\" Buy Photo \nOakland County Circuit Judge Martha Anderson speaks to the court during the re-sentencing hearing for Jennifer Pruitt, 41, for her role in a 1992 robbery gone bad that led to the murder of a 75-year-old grandfather, Elmer Heichel, on Thursday February 9, 2017 at the Oakland County Courthouse in Pontiac. (Photo: Ryan Garza, Detroit Free Press) \nTricia Dare of the Oakland County Prosecutor Office asked for the 40-60 year sentence. \n\"She was just shy of 17, she knew right from wrong,\" Dare said. \"Although many people hold the defendant out to be a victim of circumstance, and this crime to be an unfortunate thing that happened in the defendant's life, there is nothing that can excuse what happened on that date in August 1992. \n\"Elmer would have given Jennifer the shirt off his back if she'd asked for it,\" Dare said. \"He cried out to Jennifer and she said 'I can't.'\" \nFrankel argued that the state law sets a minimum of 25 years murder and that Pruitt has done everything courts and the prison system have asked her to do. \nPruitt helps other prisoners overcome substance abuse problems, mediates disputes between inmates and mentors young people on the dangers of getting involved in crime. The warden at the prison where she's housed has recommended her release, as did retired Oakland County Circuit Judge Fred Mester, who sentenced Pruitt to life without parole in 1993. Mester attending the hearing today but didn't address the court. \nFrankel noted Pruitt's abuse in prison and said the court shouldn't discount it. \n\"Don't pretend as if 25 years is zero,\" Frankel said. \"Her 25 years was probably about 125 years. We're asking the court to do what is right. She's ready to be free.\" \nPruitt, is one of about 350 Michigan prisoners serving life sentences for murder who are entitled to a new sentence. Two U.S. Supreme Court rulings, the most recent coming last year, said that life sentences for juveniles are unconstitutionally cruel and unusual and the prisoners must be resentenced. \nProsecutors still are allowed to seek life in prison for some of the cases, but the Supreme Court ruling said that should be rare. The minimum for murder is 25 years. Oakland County Prosecutor Jessica Cooper, acknowledged that Pruitt has made progress while in prison, but sought 40-60 years, in her case. \nPruitt's lawyer, Robyn Frankel, argued that 25 years was enough, noting that Pruitt wasn't the actual killer, though she did target the 75-year-old Heichel for an easy robbery. A co-defendant, Donnell Miracle, was convicted of actually stabbing Heichel 27 times at his Pontiac home in 1992. \nHeichel-Gaynett told the judge that Miracle didn't know her grandfather and if Pruitt hadn't identified him as an easy target for a robbery, he would never have been killed. \nPruitt's prison life has become famous for the brutality she endured. Within days of arriving at Scott Correction Facility in 1992, a guard pulled Pruitt from her cell and forced her to perform oral sex. Another guard began raping her in a utility closet at night. The abuse continued for years.

(Photo: Ryan Garza, Detroit Free Press) \nIn 1996, Pruitt and nine other female prisoners sued the State of Michigan over the attacks. A federal jury awarded them $15.5 million. Pruitt's share was $3.5 million, before legal fees and taxes. Other lawsuits brought by other female prisoners forced the state to pay millions more. \nGaynett noted that the family sought restitution from Pruitt at the time of her sentencing, but they were told not to bother because she would never be released and she had no assets. The statute of limitations has run out to file a suit now, though Dare requested about $9,000 for Heichel's family for burial expenses. \n\"Now she's going to walk out of there a millionaire,\" Gaynett said after the hearing. \nContact John Wisely: 313-222-6825 or jwisely@freepress.com.
