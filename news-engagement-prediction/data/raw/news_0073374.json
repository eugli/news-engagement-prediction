He hit the tree head first on his left-hand side,\" Venis said. \n\"They managed to get him on the boat pretty quickly. He coughed up some stuff and was swearing a little bit, and then he went unconscious.\" \nA series of infections, which have now spread to his lungs, had caused him serious setbacks. A team of over 20 doctors at a Melbourne hospital had been working to nurse him back to health. \"He has multiple skull fractures and multiple brian bleeds,\" Venis said. \n\"He has also got several fractures in his neck, and his T5 vertebrae. He is very heavily sedated.\" \nThe outlook for Demmocks was unknown, his sister said. The possibility of paralysis, or worse, was very real.

He had booked flights home to surprise her.\" \nInstead, his mother was keeping a vigil by his bedside. His siblings had also been with him, hoping he would pull through. \n\"Leaving him yesterday was the hardest part. I just don't know what is going to happen. I have come home to see my husband and daughter for a few days. \n\"I want us all to be there when he wakes up.
