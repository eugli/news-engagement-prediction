(AAP: Healesville Sanctuary) \nShe said the jobs could be created in a range of areas to manage the forest and support tourism. \n\"If the park is being managed properly there will be a lot of jobs in managing pests and weeds, which are a huge problem, and also in managing the ecosystem services. \n\"These are people [timber industry workers] who work in these forests, they have the machinery, they have the expertise and they have the skills. What we need to do is transition them onto a sustainable footing so that they can have jobs for the long term that are supported by all Victorians.\" Proposal will 'spell disaster' for timber mills, forestry group says \nThe State Government established the Forest Industry Taskforce to consider the region's economic and environmental future, including that of the Leadbeater's Possum. \nBut Tim Johnston from the Victorian Association of Forestry Industries said the proposal would spell disaster for timber mills in the region, and cost thousands of jobs. \n\"The industry wouldn't be viable if the Great Forest National Park, as proposed, was to get up,\" he said. \n\"The proposal would have extreme and disastrous impacts for the mill at Hayfield, but also for a number of other small family owned mills throughout the Yarra Ranges and beyond.\" \nThe Great Forest National Park would include the Yarra Ranges, Kinglake, Lake Eildon and Baw Baw national parks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T06:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T01:47:14.219+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
