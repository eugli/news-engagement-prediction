For example, don’t take your girlfriend to a Golden Corral to see an Elvis impersonator perform. Don’t do the dishes and say, “Happy Valentine’s, babe!” Also, be sure not to propose to a girl you’ve been dating for four weeks on Valentine’s. These are hypothetical of course, and definitely not things that have actually happened to me. \nWhen it comes to makeup, women know that you have absolutely no clue—which is exactly why it makes such a great Valentine’s Day gift Because women expect you to know nothing about shopping for it, makeup can be a wonderful surprise on this day celebrating love and consumerism. I’m here to help you make sure you don’t mess it up. Every girl is different, so here are some options based on what kind of girl you’re dating, and options for every kind of budget. Your Vegan Girlfriend \nYour girlfriend cooks food for you that you never would have eaten on your own. (Quinoa is pronounced keen-wa , for the record.) The vegan girlfriend demands makeup that is cruelty-free and includes zero animal products. \nOur drugstore choice: e.l.f. Little Black Beauty Book Set This eyeshadow collection is never tested on animals, vegan, and the brushes included are made of synthetic hair rather than the squirrel hair (yes, squirrel hair) that many brands use. The company signed PETA’s cruelty-free pledge, and the palette includes almost any color she could want to put on her face. Products are available at Target, Walgreens, and Kmart, so you won’t have to go far to have her appreciate your thoughtfulness. ($10) \nOur high-end choice: Ellis Faas Lights collection Ellis Faas is the biggest name in vegan makeup, and these eyeshadow markers are lovely. They’re high-quality—the colors last a long time and will bring out her beautiful eyes, whether she’s volunteering at the local organic food co-op or making her own candles in your kitchen. ($210) Your Artist Girlfriend \nYour girlfriend takes you to a gallery show every weekend, sharing new art and complimentary wine with you. Help her express herself with these bright colors. She creates something every day, be it music, paintings, or pottery, and makeup is like arts and crafts for your face. \nOur drugstore choice: NYX Ultimate Shadow Palette Sixteen colors you probably don’t understand the appeal of that she’ll love to use, and you can buy it at Target. She can make her eyeshadow look like a sunset from The Lion King if she wants. Or a coral reef, or outer space—her creativity knows no bounds, and this gift will enable her to express herself further. ($18) \nOur high-end choice: Sephora + Pantone Universe Collection Pantone is the universal standard for color. She’ll most likely recognize the branding from her work, and if she doesn’t, she’ll appreciate the hues: Rose Quartz and Serenity. The collection includes lip glosses, eyeshadows and more. The colors in the palette are varied, but not garish—perfect for your Valentine’s date at the Whitney Museum. ($110) Your Outdoorsy Girlfriend \nYour girlfriend loves adventures any time of the year, and that can be hard on her skin. Whether her face is getting dried out on a snowshoeing trip or burnt by the sun during a long day at the beach, it needs help to stay bright and soft. These products will let her know you care while protecting that face that you love so much. \nOur drugstore choice: Acure Brightening Facial Scrub This scrub is like a hot yoga class and ginger-kale-carrot juice for her face. The French clay will get the dirt and oil out of her pores, while the pomegranate, acai, and blueberry will cleanse and brighten her skin. Plus, she’ll smell great when you go in for a kiss. $10) \nOur high-end choice: Tom Ford 'Intensive Infusion' Ultra-Rich Moisturizer Honestly it doesn’t matter what this product does. You’re paying $330 for 1.7 ounces of something that says “Tom Ford” on it. That would be enough for me. But if you care to know, the site ambiguously states that it “prompts cells to replenish their natural energy.” Oh, okay. ($330) Your Girlfriend Who Works Too Much \nShe’s serious, business-minded, and stays late at the office so much that your only dates occur on her lunch breaks. You don’t see her enough, but these gifts will ensure that when you do, she’s relaxed and rejuvenated. \nOur drugstore choice: Aveeno Soothing Bath Treatment Your girlfriend will appreciate this bath treatment for several reasons: It’s natural, soothing, and kind to skin. If she’s like me, and works so hard that she gets stress hives, the oatmeal in this recipe will calm them and she’ll leave the bath feeling like a new woman, one who’s not so focused on getting that promotion that she forgets to eat. ($7) \nOur high-end choice: Chanel No 5 Bath Oil You probably don’t know that Marilyn Monroe wore this scent, but your girlfriend does. Rose and jasmine will fill the tub and your bathroom as she relaxes after a 14-hour day at the office. There’s a “hair mist,” lotion, perfume, and soap in the same scent if you’re feeling generous. You should be, it’s Valentine’s Day. ($85) A final tip \nConcealer is makeup designed to neutralize the red color of pimples and cover them up. Never buy your girlfriend concealer , unless you want to spend an hour or so apologizing to her and possibly get dumped. She will assume that you’re telling her she has bad skin, and what a terrible way to let her know you care. Try not to point out your girlfriend’s acne on Valentine’s Day. Bad move.
