Above, a center in Minnesota. (WCCO) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Monday, February 20, 2017, 5:55 PM \nJewish community centers across the country received bomb threats on Monday, the fourth wave of what has become a troubling trend in 2017. \nCenters in Chicago, Houston, Tampa and Buffalo were among 11 centers that were called Monday, though no explosives were found and no one was injured. \nThe latest hoaxes have brought the total number of threats to 69 threats called into 54 JCCs in 27 states and one Canadian province since the beginning of the year, according to the JCC Association of North America. \nLocations in Manhattan, Long Island and New Jersey were called during three waves of calls in January. \nVP Pence visits former Nazi concentration camp in Germany \nThe FBI told the Daily News last month that it and the Department of Justice are investigating possible civil rights violations in the calls, and repeated the same statement Monday \n“We will not be cowed by threats intended to disrupt people’s lives or the vital role Jewish community centers play as gathering places, schools, camps, and fitness and recreation centers,” the JCC Association said in a statement. \nSome centers such as one in Minnesota evacuated, though different locations have different policies on how to respond to the hoaxes. \nThe Anti-Defamation League said that it is “deeply disturbed” by the hoaxes, but that the fact that threats are being made is “alarming, disruptive, and must always been taken seriously.” \nBomb threats have come amid recent reports of anti-Semitism across the country, such as swastikas being painted in Adam Yauch Park in Brooklyn or scratched onto the subway. \nDozens of headstones at a historic Jewish cemetery in St. Louis were found damaged on Monday. \nA Jewish reporter asked President Trump about what he called rising anti-Semitism at a press conference last week, and the President responded by saying that he is the “least anti-Semitic person that you’ve ever seen in your entire life.” Join the Conversation:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T05:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:10:11.778+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
