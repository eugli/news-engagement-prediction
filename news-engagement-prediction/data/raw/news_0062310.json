Steve Smith, R-Maricopa, the bill's sponsor, said Senate Bill 1367 isn't about abortion. It's about what should happen when a baby is born alive as opposed to current \"barbaric\" practices.\nThe Senate approved the measure on an 18-12 vote Wednesday, with all Republicans and Democratic Sen. Catherine Miranda of Phoenix in support. It now moves to the House.\nThe bill would require hospitals and clinics providing abortions at 20 weeks or beyond to have medical equipment on site to care for a fetus delivered alive. If a delivered baby is breathing, has a heartbeat and is moving, doctors must use all available means and medical skills to save its life.\nSupporters have focused their arguments on two cases in Arizona over the past decade in which a fetus may have been born alive during an abortion procedure. They said in one case, a baby lay on a table for 20 minutes before dying. In the other, a clinic staff member called 911 after she believed she may have seen a fetus move or breathe.\nThe baby was taken to the hospital with no vital signs and pronounced dead. The incident was investigated by the Arizona Attorney General's Office, which found no wrongdoing.\n\"Does it sound compassionate to you that they're going to let a baby die in front of them?\" Smith said.\nBut opponents argue the bill is anything but compassionate. It isn't about abortion and would require doctors to take unnecessary medical steps for a wanted child born too early to live or with a fatal defect that assures its death, they said.\nCurrent law gives doctors more flexibility, requiring them to do everything possible to save the life of the fetus only if they believe it has a chance of surviving outside the uterus.\n\"This is a really hard bill to talk about,\" said Senate Minority Leader Katie Hobbs, D-Phoenix. \"There's not a distinction in the bill for a delivery at 20 weeks that is from an abortion or just a preterm delivery.\"\nAs someone who has had a miscarriage, Hobbs said, she wished that she had the opportunity to hold her child even for just a few minutes, as is standard practice now with a baby born with a fatal defect.\n\"Let the mother hold the baby and grieve,\" she said. \"When you know the infant will not survive, it is cruel and against medical ethics to administer that kind of resuscitative care that can actually harm the infant.\"\nThe conservative Center for Arizona Policy is behind the bill. Organization President Cathi Herrod confirmed that the bill was written to apply to all births, and not just elective abortions.\n\"That is a termination. That is an abortion,\" she told The Arizona Republic when asked whether the bill applied to more than scheduled abortions. \"The baby might live. Neither doctors nor parents can play God.\"\nSen. Kate Brophy McGee, R-Phoenix, voted for the bill but said she has reservations.\n\n\"I am pro-life and I think the aspects of this legislation that require equipment to be present (are) absolutely appropriate,\" she said, but added that she is concerned about the bill also applying to \"women who wanted those babies and planned for those babies and there was something wrong.\"\nRELATED: \nArizona abortion bill may affect other births", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T09:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T11:44:27.221+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
