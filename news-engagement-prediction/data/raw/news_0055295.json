The parents lugged their youngest of three children around Walmart, filling their shopping cart to the brim with groceries while crossing their fingers that they'd be able to afford the total cost of it all. What happened next will warm your heart, and Ashley shared the whole story in a touching social media post to spread the word. \nIn the post, Ashley described why she and her husband dislike grocery shopping for their family of five. \"We literally dread going to Walmart and buying groceries, period, because my husband's whole check goes to food for our family,\" she wrote. \nOn this visit to the superstore, Ashley encountered a sweet cashier, Sharnique Dasant, who commented on the large amount of groceries on the belt, which led Ashley to explain that they have a big family. While rummaging in her purse for the money to pay, Ashley said the Walmart cashier smiled at her and said, \"You guys look like you need a blessing tonight.\" ADVERTISEMENT \nAfter Sharnique entered something in on the keypad, Ashley looked down to see quite the pleasant surprise: Sharnique had paid for half of the family's groceries! The parents couldn't believe their eyes. \"I was in complete shock because I never expected anything like that to ever happen,\" Ashley wrote. \"Me and my husband were just staring at each other like is she serious? Did she really just do this?\" \nShe went on to describe how she truly had trouble finding the right words to say to thank the kind cashier. \"How could this woman who didn't even know me, know our situation, know us, why would she do this?\" she asked in the post. But it looks like Ashley ended up finding the perfect way to show her thanks, and ended her post saying, \"Thank you so much Sharnique Dasant â€” you truly are a blessing and you will never realize how much you helped us out and how much faith you have put back into our hearts.\" If this story doesn't restore your faith in humanity, we're not quite sure what will.
