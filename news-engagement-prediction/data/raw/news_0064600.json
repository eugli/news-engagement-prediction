The annual Coachella running joke - that the beloved Daft Punk will make a surprise appearance - is being taken a little bit more seriously this year with the gaping slot. Shocker: While the news the heavily pregnant superstar had reneged on doctors advice was upsetting for most, it hardly came as a big shock, seeing as she would be almost ready to deliver her twins by the time the two-weekend music festival kicked off in April Call her, maybe? Some called for a Beyonce hologram, a la 2 Pac on on the same stage five years earlier, while others suggested replacements like Carly Rae Jepsen One tweeter posted a picture of the robotic Thomas Bangalter reading the news with great interest. Some fans were extra upset they would miss Queen Bey's performance, AND the chance to see her give birth during the concert. Others called for a Beyonce hologram, a la 2 Pac on on the same stage five years earlier. What to do: The annual Coachella running joke - that the beloved Daft Punk will make a surprise appearance - is being taken a little bit more seriously this year with the gaping slot. Some pointed out refunds are a no-go, since the Coachella small print states line-ups are subject to change One fan - possibly sarcastically - declared he was 'bummed I won't get to see Beyonce perform sitting down at Coachella now'. Another cynically pointed out that the small print on Coachella tickets covers the organisers for line-up changes, so not to bother asking for refunds. A third announced she would gladly take all the tickets from anyone who was going 'purely for Beyonce'. Jumping in: Some fans were extra upset they would miss Queen Bey's performance, AND the chance to see her give birth during the concert; Lady Gaga was another replacement suggestion Meanwhile, many of the Beyhive were more upset Beyonce appeared to have a secret Snapchat account without telling anybody, as her filtered picture seemed to suggest. The 35-year-old was unveiled as the headline act on January 3, a day before tickets went on sale. She revealed her pregnancy to the public a month later. Coachella organizers were said to be unaware of the news until she posted the now iconic announcement on Instagram. Obviously: Some joked that the festival organizers were the only ones taken by surprise A statement released by her team and festival producer Goldenvoice on Thursday read: 'Following the advice of her doctors to keep a less rigorous schedule in the coming months, Beyonce has made the decision to forgo performing at the 2017 Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival.' 'However, Goldenvoice and Parkwood are pleased to confirm that she will be a headliner at the 2018 festival. Thank you for your understanding.' Radiohead and Kendrick Lamar will also headline the two-weekend festival in Indio, California. Radiohead will perform on April 14 and 21, and Lamar on April 16 and 23.
