(PTI Photo) \nUttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav may have emerged as a popular and a promising Chief Minister, yet all the people who praise him are not ready to vote for him in the crucial Uttar Pradesh Assembly Elections 2017. Reasons are many. Some Akhilesh fans say the CM is good, but his partymen are goons. Some say SP is inherently biased towards the Yadavs and Muslims, hence they can’t vote for Akhilesh even as he is promising. \nIn the last 2.5 years, Akhilesh has tried to break away from the conventional image of SP and brand himself as a development-oriented politician who can take on even his family members for the sake of the state. However, Akhilesh’s efforts have not convinced all voters, even as most of the people in the state are impressed. Even opinion polls recently had confirmed Akhilesh’s popularity across the state. \nA report in the Indian Express has tried to capture the voters’ dilemma vis-a-vis Akhilesh. \nHere are how some of Akhilesh fans responded when asked if they would vote for the CM again. \nIn Kanpur, Ishan Bajpayee, 26, says he admires the work done by Akhilesh and is impressed by his dynamism. he doesn’t like the SP-BSP’s “consistent Muslim pitch.” He says he will vote for the BJP . \nIn Mahoba, Ashish Tiwari, 23, however, is all for SP and Akhilesh’s leadership. He says, “Of the 100 ponds in this region, 52 are in Mahoba. This is all because of Akhilesh. All the people are voting for him.” \nIn Mahoba, Jageshwar Chaurasia says “The BSP candidate has not worked for the people otherwise he would have been in a good position. There are a lot of Jatavs in this area. The fight is between SP and BJP.” \nIn Panchphera village of Mahoba, Bhagwandas Rajput, 60, says that all non-Yadav OBCs are going with the BJP. \nIn Etawah, a Lodh Rajput voter says it used to take more than three hours to reach Kanpur but now it takes just over two due to the roads built by Akhilesh. Jeetendra Yadav says that’s why all are voting for SP and despite the family feud the party will win. But when Yadav leaves, Rajput says that his community has decided to vote for the BJP. \nIn Bareilly’s Khempura village, Mausam Khan is very happy with Akhilesh but will vote for BSP as the SP MLA in the constituency does not listen to the villagers. \nIn Jhansi, Mohd Sadiq says, “Jitna kaam abhi hua utna to pehle kabhi nahi hua.” But he will vote for BSP as he feels the SP candidate is weak and voting for him will be a waste. \nBhola Singh Rajput in Etawah says, “In this region, all contracts, employment and benefits go to Yadavs. Earlier, we had no option so we would keep voting for them. But now we see the BJP as a real challenger.” \nIn Bundelkhand’s Babina, Suraj Singh Rajput says, “Wherever they are, they keep bullying others. Akhilesh is good and shows promise. But he is not here. He is in Lucknow while his partymen go on the rampage here. He can’t control every small local leader.” Please Wait while comments are loading...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T20:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T09:36:03.131+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
