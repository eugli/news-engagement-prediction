Instead, Perez was welcomed into his new job on Saturday by jeering progressive activists , who for the second time in a year, saw their preferred pick to lead the party defeated after a protracted and unexpectedly feisty campaign. Supporters of Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, the choice of Sen. Bernie Sanders, painted Perez's election as another victory for an establishment they blame for ceding the White House to Donald Trump by alienating young and working class voters.

Across the ballroom, one young and frustrated Ellison supporter, Alexa Vaca, put it simply: \"This shows that the Democratic Party didn't learn their lesson.\" Read More While Democrats clawed at each other in Atlanta, the festivities at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Maryland, were beginning to wind down. Over the previous 48 hours, the annual conservative gathering had welcomed its first sitting Republican president in his first year in office since Ronald Reagan. \"I wouldn't miss a chance to talk to my friends,\" Trump said between roars of approval during his Friday address . \"These are my friends. And we'll see you again next year and the year after that, and I'll be doing this with CPAC whenever I can, and I'll make sure that we're here a lot.\" A year before, Trump skipped the conference, backing out the day before his scheduled appearance. The American Conservative Union, which organizes the gathering, bit back in response, saying Trump's decision \"comes at a critical time in our movement's history. His decision sends a clear message to grassroots conservatives.\" That was then. Now, Trump is in the White House and supporters wearing his signature red hats dotted the conference's halls and ballrooms. Asked if they considered the President a true conservative, attendees who affirmed his credentials -- as eager to vouch for Trump as anti-Perez Democrats had been to highlight where the party's establishment had failed them -- employed an assortment of rhetorical contortions .
