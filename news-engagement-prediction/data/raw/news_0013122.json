That's how Barnes chose to describe it. \nHis Tennessee basketball team lived out the analogy a little over 24 hours later against Mississippi State. \nThe Vols led by as many as 19 points in the first half, then watched as that lead got smaller and smaller over the course of the second half. It disappeared entirely with four minutes, 22 seconds left, when Xavian Stapleton hit a go-ahead 3-pointer, as Mississippi State rallied to stun Tennessee 64-59 in front of 7,581 at Humphrey Coliseum. \nThe loss snapped the Vols' Southeastern Conference-best four-game win streak. \nFreshman point guard Jordan Bone had 13 points for Tennessee (13-10, 5-5 SEC) and freshman forward Grant Williams scored 11 before fouling out. Robert Hubbs was held to four points in 32 minutes. \nMississippi State (14-8, 5-5) got 16 points from Mario Kegler and 14 from Xavian Stapleton. Schnider Herard had 12, scoring eight at the free-throw line. \nJordan Bowden's layup with 1:05 left cut the Mississippi State lead to 60-59, but Herard scored after an offensive board to put the Bulldogs back up by three on the other end. Tennessee couldn't answer from there. \nState tied the game on a Weatherspoon transition layup with 6:10 left, before Stapleton's trey put the Bulldogs ahead for good with 4:22 left. \nTennessee led 50-39 with 10:04 to go, but went over five minutes without a made field goal, while Mississippi State went on a 18-3 run to take a 57-53 lead with 3:46 left. \n  \nTennessee led by as man as 19 in the first half and took a 33-21 lead into the locker room at halftime. \nMississippi State shot just 20.0 percent (7 of 35) from the floor in the first half, 21.1 percent (4 of 19) from the 3-point line and 33.3 percent (3 of 9) from the free-throw line in the first half. \nKegler scored nine's of State's 21 first-half points. \nKyle Alexander and Grant Williams, with six points each, led a balanced Tennessee attack in the first half. Of 10 Vols that played in the first half, nine scored. The lead could have been bigger had Tennessee not gone 6-for-14 from the free-throw line in the first half. \nThe Vols 29-10 with 4:50 left before halftime, but the Bulldogs used an 11-2 run to trim the lead. \nTennessee is back at Thompson-Boling Arena on Wednesday (TV: SEC Network, 6:30 p.m.), hosting Ole Miss (13-9, 4-5). The Vols led 52-39 with 15 minutes to play in Oxford, Miss., on Jan. 17, but the Rebels closed the game on a 41-17 run to win 80-69. \n(Buy one month of GoVols247 VIP access and GET TWO MONTHS FREE .)
