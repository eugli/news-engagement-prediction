Some of the finds recovered from the Viking's grave are pictured here. From top left clockwise is a broad-bladed axe, shield boss, ringed pin and the hammer and tongs\nFEMALE VIKINGS A ‘Shieldmaiden’ is a mythical female Viking who has chosen to fight as a warrior.\nThey appear in Viking folklore, and may have been the basis for the mythical ‘valkyries.’\nThe existence of female Viking warriors is heavily debated.\nWhile there are many tales of individual women fighting in battles in Viking folklore, almost none speak of a community of trained female warriors like the Shieldmaiden myth.\nMany historians argue that there isn’t enough hard evidence of the training and battling of female Vikings to conclude that they existed.\nThe research has found that the warrior was Scandinavian, meaning their burial at western Scotland's Swordle Bay laid them to rest a long way from home.\nThe report, in the journal Antiquity, says the sword and other grave goods might 'traditionally suggest' it was the burial of a man.\nHowever, it also says: 'Any reading remains highly interpretive.'\nDr Oliver Harris, from the University of Leicester's School of Archaeology and Ancient History and co-director of the Ardnamurchan Transitions Project (ATP), said told Herald Scotland : 'The teeth themselves don't gender the person at all.\n'So at the moment, we are left looking at the artefacts.\nHe said that a sword, axe and spear discovered in the grave suggest that a male warrior is buried in the grave.\n'There are more Viking burials with swords that are men than women – if you want to play a statistical game, you would say it is probably a man,' he said.\n'But you might choose to look at other grave goods, like the ladle or pan or sickle that don't necessarily send the same kind of message.'\nThey were placed in the boat with their shield on top of them, then the grave was filled to the top with stones.\nViking woman were known to be warriors, said Harris.\nThe warrior, of whom only two teeth and some fragments of bone are left, would have been buried in a Pagan ritual.\nA set of strange isotopes in the warrior's teeth are also similar to a female found buried at Cnip on the Isle of Lewis, the report said.\nThe Viking's sword (top); was buried alongside them along with mineralised textile remains (right). Detail of the decoration after conservation can be seen to the left of the image\nTHE VIKINGS IN IRELAND The first attack by Vikings on Ireland was recorded around 795AD by Irish monks in the Annals of Ulster.\nThe first Vikings to arrive on Irish soil were from Scandinavia, they had set out to find and settle on new lands.\nThey had already settled in Scotland and, like Ireland, they began to settle within the local population.\nThe Vikings would remain in Ireland until the early 1,000's when they were driven out by an Irish rebellion.\nBut they left their mark on the island, helping the Irish to progress technologically with warships, weapons, and battle tactics.\nThey also helped to build Ireland's first towns such as Dublin, Cork and Waterford.\nShe was alive around the same time during the 10th Century.\nFemale Viking warriors could have fought as 'Shieldmaidens'.\nThey appear in Viking folklore, and may have been the basis for the mythical valkyries.\nBut the existence of female Viking warriors is heavily debated.\nWhile there are many tales of individual women fighting in battles in Viking folklore, almost none speak of a community of trained female warriors like the Shieldmaiden myth.\nBut the artefacts found in the soldier's grave are a mix of Scandinavian and Irish goods, the research found.\nThe University of Leicester archaeologists who studied the site suggest that the warrior was an extensive traveller.\nThe burial site was originally discovered in 2011 at western Scotland's Swordle Bay. The burial represents the first excavation of an intact Viking boat burial by archaeologists on the UK\n'The findings suggest a connection between Scandinavia and Ireland in the objects found, as well as information about the history of diet of the person buried here and their connections away from Swordle Bay,' archaeologist Dr Oliver Harris said.\nObjects found at the site – including a sword, spearhead and 213 of the burial boat's rivets - indicate that the warrior was likely of a high status.\nOther objects found at the site are connected to daily life such as cooking, work, farming and food production.\nThe archaeologists claim that the burial site is rich in symbolism due to its closeness to a Neolithic burial cairn - a human-made stack of stones.\nSome of the cairn's stones may have been incorporated into the Viking's grave.\nOther findings at the site include a single copper alloy ringed pin, thought to have been used to fasten a burial cloak or shroud.\nMineralised textile and wood remains were also discovered at the grave.\nAnd archaeologists found a whetstone, used to cut and sharpen tools, made from Norwegian rock.\n'The burial represents the first excavation of an intact Viking boat burial by archaeologists on the UK mainland and provides a significant addition to our knowledge of burial practices from this period,' Dr Harris said.\nThe research team added: 'Critically, when considering a burial like this, it is essential to remember that each of these objects, and each of these actions, was never isolated, but rather they emerge out of, and help to form, an assemblage that knits together multiple places, people and moments in time.'\nThe Viking warrior's body was first discovered in 2011.\nThe grave is thought to date from around 1,000AD at the height of the 'Second Viking Age'.\nPictured is a sketch of how the boat burial would have looked. Ships were a Viking's most prized possessions. If a high-born Viking did not die at sea he would be buried in a ship on land\nArchaeologist Helena Gray with the sword and other artefacts found in the grave. The Viking vessel the warrior was buried in has almost completely rotted away\nA sword, axe head and a bronze ring pin found at the burial site. The warrior, of whom only two teeth and some fragments of bone are left, would have been laid to rest in a Pagan ritual\nFor almost 200 years, from the end of the eighth century until the reign of Alfred the Great, Danish and Norwegian pirates had harassed and looted the British coast at will, and towards the end of that period moved further inland in a war of conquest.\nBut in the 870s, Alfred – and later his descendants – united England against the Viking invaders, driving them out of their English strongholds and back to Scandinavia.\nThey did not return for more than a century, and when they did, peace was shattered.\nDr Oliver Harris examines a sword with another archaeologist at the burial site\nDr Hannah Cobb, co-director of the Ardnamurchan Transitions Project, studies a viking sword\nThe Anglo-Saxons, by now ruled by the hapless Aethelred the Unready, were once again put to the sword, and huge amounts of money and goods were extorted from the native population in the form of Danegeld – a tax raised by the Vikings.\nBy 1016, the conquest was completed when Canute became the first Danish king of all England.\nIt is from this period that the tomb dates, and its elaborate contents show how wealthy the Vikings had become.\nMany were converting to Christianity at the time, but from the artefacts laid to rest alongside him, it is clear this nobleman had been firmly committed to the old Norse religion.\nHelena Gray, also a co-director of The Ardnamurchan Transitions Project, with an axe head found at the site\nThis viking's tooth was one of the many fascinating finds\nThe Viking vessel the warrior was buried in has almost completely rotted away.\nOnly some 200 metal rivets used to hold the boat together remain, with tiny splinters of wood attached.\nThe bronze drinking horn and weapons would have equipped the raider for Valhalla, the giant heavenly hall where the bravest Viking warriors believed they would spend eternity.\nA bronze ring pin found at the site that was likely used to fasten a burial cape or shaw\nDr Hannah Cobb from Manchester University, who co-directed the 2011 excavation project, said: 'People have been fascinated by these boats for a long time but it is extremely rare to find a burial site intact, so it is of international importance.\n'The artefacts and preservation also make this one of the most important Norse graves ever excavated in Britain.'\nViking boat burials were very rare because they were reserved for important figures, and many took place in coastal areas which have eroded away over the years, she added.\nBritain's most famous ship burial, Sutton Hoo, is not Viking, but Anglo Saxon, and dates from centuries after the Vikings left the mainland.\nTHE VIKINGS Ships were a Viking's most prized possessions. If a high-born Viking did not die at sea he would be buried in a ship on land.\nVikings did not want to die in bed as this would mean thy would end up in a foggy underworld called Niflheim.\nBut if they died in battle they would go to glorious Valhalla.\nVikings believed that the world was flat, surrounded by sea and help up by a giant ash tree called Yggdrasil.\nThey would only bathe once a week.\nViking women were highly respected in Norse culture. They were free to choose their spouse and free to divorce.", "external_links": ["http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/15071194.The_Viking___39_chieftain__39__who_may_have_been_a_woman___and_other_secrets_of_the_rare_boat_burial_discovered_in_Scotland/", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-08T21:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:35:05.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
