But if he is innocent, they owe us an apology,” the father said at the family home in the Nile Delta city of Mansoura. \n“He is a very respectable man who never had a problem with anybody, he never had any sort of political views,” he said. “His main concern in his life was his work in the United Arab Emirates,” he said, adding that his son had gone to France on a “work assignment.” \nAbdullah has lived in Dubai for the past five years, employed by what his father said was a law firm. \nThe Paris prosecutor’s office says the attacker was shot after lightly wounding a soldier patrolling an underground mall near the famous Paris museum, but that the injuries are no longer life-threatening. \nREAD MORE: French soldier shoots knife-wielding attacker at Louvre museum in Paris \nIbrahim Youssry, a close friend of Abdullah al-Hamahmy, said his behaviour on the day of the attack did not betray any intention to commit an act of violence. \n“Before the attack, he commented on one of our friends’ pictures on Instagram and liked some (other) pictures. He also called his father and asked him what to bring for him from France. All this contradicts the French story,” said Youssry. \nTwo Egyptian officials said Sunday that local security agencies were continuing to gather information on Abdullah al-Hamahmy to help establish if he was a member of any militant groups or had been radicalized. \nWATCH: Attacker at Paris’ Louvre cried out ‘Allahu Akbar’: police \n\n“We are trying to determine whether he was a lone wolf, worked with a group or he is innocent,” said one of the two officials, who is employed by the Interior Ministry. Investigators were examining his social media accounts, he added. \n“His tweets show a radicalized person. He supports the Daesh and other extremists in Syria,” said the official, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State group. \nOne recent tweet by Abdullah al-Hamahmy defended the Islamic State. \n“Why are they sacred of the Islamic State? Because the Islamic State defends its resources, territory, the honour and dignity of Muslims,” he wrote. \nThe information gathered on Abdullah al-Hamahmy will be shared with French authorities, according to the second official, who is with the Foreign Ministry. \nBoth officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. © 2017 The Canadian Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T00:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T05:11:12.283+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
