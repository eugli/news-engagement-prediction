Recording Academy president and CEO Neil Portnow said the event, which raises funds for the Grammy Foundation, set attendance and revenue records. \nELI Service Award recipient Elliot Groffman -- a partner at Carroll, Guido & Groffman, whose clients include the Dave Matthews Band , Pearl Jam, Patti Smith, Arcade Fire and Andre 3000 -- received two standing ovations and a whole lotta love for remarks that spanned business and social policy. \n\"In the overheated political environment that we live in today, we need to aggressively use our role as artist representatives and partners to encourage the artist community to find its individual and collective voice and support the social and political causes that are important to them -- and us -- in the face of political opposition,\" Groffman said, garnering applause. \nRead more: Tom Petty Joined by Foo Fighters, Stevie Nicks & Many More at Epic MusiCares Tribute Show \nGroffman's activism also extended to artist-label relations. He drew murmurs of assent when he suggested the time is right to reconsider the nature of \"360 deals,\" which he characterized as \"the key challenge\" for artists' lawyers. \n\"If the future is so bright, can we get there together? Can both the labels and artists thrive?\" Groffman noted he was \"not here to debate whether the labels should be asking for these rights, although, he added after a beat, \"I'm happy to do so over cocktails with anyone who wants to join me later.\" \nIn achieving a proper balance between the needs of the artist and a proper return on investment for the label, Groffman urged reasonableness and a sense of perspective. “Let's say it's been years since tour support or other extraordinary marketing expenditures are required for maintenance of that career. We need to be able to flip these deals and start to phase out these participations. Otherwise, what might arguably be a helpful inducement to a label to spend properly or even enthusiastically in the early days can turn into a windfall, which will hurt the artist. We need a balanced and healthy ecosystem to nurture talent and provide returns so when we get to that bright, bundled future, we have a sustainable and balanced business model.\" p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px 'Lucida Grande'} National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences President Neil Portnow, attorney Henry W. Root, honoree Elliot Groffman, musician Dave Matthews, and music manager Coran Capshaw attend the Entertainment Law Initiative on Feb. 10, 2017 in Los Angeles. Michael Kovac/WireImage \nGroffman was introduced by Dave Matthews, who proved to be quite the crowd pleaser, drawing laughter throughout his remarks, but never so much as when he took a jab at President Donald Trump. Alluding to the boom times predicted in the business keynote by William Morris Endeavor head of music Marc Geiger, who preceded him to the stage, Matthews made the point that when times are good it’s important to remember those who’ve helped on the way up, and suggested it’s not bad practice to likewise take note of who maybe wasn’t so nice. \n“That terrible Civil War image that [Marc Geiger] put up. That thing was hardcore. Bloated corpses! That’s not fake, that’s real dead people! Huh. Kind of reminded me of the president.” \nGeiger took the audience through a five-point look at the road ahead, emphasizing a future in which stand-alone music subscriptions would be going the way of the Edsel insofar as driving revenue. \n\"In the age of Google Play, Amazon Prime and soon to be Apple TV Music Media or whatever,\" bundled content services that include music, photo storage, movies and games will replace the existing cable TV subscriptions, Geiger predicted. \"People are complaining about paying $10 today, this is going to cost $99, and the question for everybody in this room is how much of that $99 will go towards music?\" \nAs per Geiger's projection, there's gold in them hills. “This new business is going to be much, much bigger than the old business,\" he asserted. \"Publishers, labels and digital companies are soon to be flush with cash. Return of the private jet.\" \nThe program was well-received by attendees. \"Elliot was so inspiring, talking about advocating for the artist, and how the labels need to look for balance and need not be so aggressive when it comes to our clients' income stream,\" LaPolt Law PC's Dina LaPolt observed afterward. \"He went through the trajectory of his career, but made that final point to the labels.” \nGreenberg Traurig's Todd Cooper cited as a high point the comedic stylings of Dave Matthews. \"Who knew he had such mad stand-up skills?\" \nRead more: Grammys 2017: The Complete Party Guide (Updating) \nThe ceremony is designed in part to recognize law school student winners of the ELI writing competition.
