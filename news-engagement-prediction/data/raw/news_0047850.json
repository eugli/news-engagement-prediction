Kingsley Amis imagined that the Reformation had never happened and made Protestant theologist Martin Luther a Pope. \nJohn Banville had Mary Queen of Scots execute her cousin Elizabeth. Ben Elton prevented the assassination of Franz Ferdinand. But the most popular “what if…?” is “ what if those scary Nazis had won the war? ” \nPhilip K Dick, Philip Roth, Robert Harris, Harry Turteldove, Owen Sheers and plenty more have all come at the nightmare from their own angle (female authors, it seems, are not that into what-iffery). \nNo book, however, has brought the scenario home to roost quite like Len Deighton’s SS-GB , now a five-part drama on BBC One. In it, the Luftwaffe have won the Battle of Britain, England is occupied and Churchill is said to have flicked two fingers at the firing squad. \nDeighton’s novel is nearly 40 years old, but this feels like a good time for it to pop up. At the ballot box, plucky little England has only just repelled the might of a Teutonic EU. \nMeanwhile, America seems to living out its own alt-history for real, in which a tangerine with a comb-over implausibly storms the White House. At a glance | “Pax Germanica” fiction \nS S-GB laid out the alternative facts in the opening sequence with almost sadistic relish. An air-rolling Spitfire, one of the very last left, came in to land on the Mall in front of a blockaded Buckingham Palace. The Germans were showing it off to their visiting Soviet ally, Marshal Zhukov. \nNazi flags and banners were all over: hanging down the façade of Parliament and, more shockingly still, draped around the otherwise naked girlfriend of Chief Superintendant Douglas Archer when we first met him. \nAt the heart of SS-GB is the question of collaboration or resistance. Archer (Sam Riley) is a Scotland Yard detective charged with holding up the law, but whose law? Britain’s or the Reich’s? \nHe could just about hold his nose and have his picture taken with his police superior, SS Gruppenführer Kellerman (Rainer Bock). Kellerman has the civility to wear mufti, even if it’s a suit of garish check that’s hardly appropriate for the office. \nBut after Archer went to investigate a fishy-looking murder that seemed to involve the resistance, everything changed. SS Standartenführer Doktor Huth (Lars Eidinger), a petrifying acolyte of Himmler’s, was on the next plane from Berlin to take charge of the investigation. Huth ticks all the stereotypical boxes: ascetic, pitiless, austerely clean-shaven, not keen on sightseeing.

Whenever he does open his mouth, Riley has a booming, gravelly larynx that he often softened to a whisper. It must play merry hell with the sound department. \nBut he commanded the centre of this promising opener with manly vigour. It helps that, aside from his German superiors and James Cosmo’s wheezing old police sidekick, his sparring partners are all women. Each hails from a different point on the archetypal spectrum. \nBarbara Barga from The New York Times (Kate Bosworth) is a vampy icemaiden in frosted pink. Archer’s secretary/girlfriend Sylvia (Maeve Dermody) is an impulsive wildcat who’s off to join the resistance. And then back at his lodgings, looking after his son, is tragic mumsy landlady Mrs Sheehan (Christina Cole).

The adaptation is by Robert Wade and Neil Purvis , who co-wrote several James Bond scripts, including Casino Royale, Skyfall and Spectre, and seem to know their way around Archer’s conflicted conscience and Deighton’s clipped dialogue. The Dorchester, said Miss Barga, “is not what it was.” \n“Nothing is,” retorted Archer. SS-GB looks and sounds a lot more convincing than Close to the Enemy, the last BBC drama to visit London in the Forties. Director Philipp Kadelbach has a feel for barren morgues and echoing corridors, and has meticulously filtered almost all the cheerful hues out of stately London. This is a black and white film in brown, khaki and Nazi scarlet. \nNevertheless, the key question, as we watch SS-GB, is how we Brits would have responded to the swastika on our doorstep. \nEverywhere else in Europe, the countries whose peace-conferring union we’ve voted to abandon, had to put up with all this for real.
