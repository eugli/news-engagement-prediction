If you'd like to learn more... - \nA snowfall warning remains in effect Friday for Vancouver, the Fraser Valley, Greater Victoria, the Sunshine Coast and east and west Vancouver Island. \nSignificant accumulation is expected after the snow arrived early Friday morning. \nThe snow has resulted in some problems on the roads. Highway 1 in North Vancouver is very slow and heavy in both directions due to the falling and sticking snow. \nThere are also some transit delays, including HandyDart, which is running essential service only in Vancouver, Richmond, North and West Vancouver. \nSnow will fall for the majority of the day in the Lower Mainland. Five to 10 cm is likely by the end of the day as temperatures hover near the freezing point. \nWATCH: BC Morning Weather Forecast: Feb 3 Story continues below \nThe next band of precipitation coming in tonight may be mixed with rain, but local additional snowfall amounts of 5 to 15 cm are possible especially at higher levels of Metro Vancouver, including the Fraser Valley and over other South Coastal sections. \nAlthough rain will be more dominant on Saturday and Sunday in Metro Vancouver, colder air coming in again Sunday night and on Monday will likely result in more snow. Rare snowfall \nMetro Vancouver hasnâ€™t seen this much snowfall in the winter since 2008-2009. Global BC meteorologist Mark Madryga says a snowfall event like this occurs every 10 years or so. Last time it snowed in February was on Feb. 24, 2014 14.4 cm falling at the Vancouver Airport. \nMetro Vancouver has not seen snow on Valentineâ€™s Day since 1990 and 1995. Preparing the bridges \nCrews with the Ministry of Transportation have already been preparing the Alex Fraser Bridge and the Port Mann Bridge ahead of todayâ€™s anticipated snowfall. \nBridge crews will be on site Friday, working to clear and closely monitor both bridges to keep the two bridges safe for travel during winter conditions. \nCrew members will perform precautionary safety measures as necessary, such as spraying de-icing agent on the cross-beams of the Alex Fraser, and snow-clearing cable drops on the Port Mann. There may be single-lane closures on the Port Mann for crew safety while they work. \nA helicopter is also on stand-by if it is needed to clear snow from the cables of the Alex Fraser Bridge. \nIf snow and ice accumulates on the Alex Fraser, crews will temporarily close the bridge for two to three hours. \nWATCH: Timelapse of snow falling over downtown Vancouver Friday morning Snow on Friday \nThe snow is falling and accumulating on southern Vancouver Island, in areas such as Lantzville, Port Alberni, Qualicum Beach, Nanaimo and Victoria. \nâ€” Steven W POPE (@88pope) February 3, 2017 @GlobalBC North Nanaimo.
