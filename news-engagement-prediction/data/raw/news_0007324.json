His administration did slow down the processing for Iraqis seeking Special Immigrant Visas, which are given to translators and interpreters who worked with the U.S. in that country.\nThe slowdown was prompted by the May 2011 arrest of two men in Kentucky charged with plotting to send weapons and money to al-Qaida operatives abroad. Waad Ramadan Alwan and Mohanad Shareef Hammadi, were mistakenly admitted to the U.S. as Iraqi refugees in 2009 and resettled in Bowling Green, Kentucky.\nAlwan and Hammadi are in prison after pleading guilty. They were never accused of plotting to launch attacks inside the U.S.\nAccording to State Department data, 9,388 Iraqi refugees were admitted to the United States during the 2011 budget year. The data also show that Iraqi refugees were admitted every month during the 2011 calendar year.\nIn addition, more than 7,800 Iraqis were allowed into the United States on nonimmigrant visas, including tourists, during the 2011 budget year, government data show.\nRelated Stories Kellyanne Conway says she 'misspoke' about 'Bowling Green massacre' Trump travel ban sows chaos at airports, outrage at protests White House: Immigration order 'small price' for safety In new White House, a look at Trump's inner circle Trump sets 5-year and lifetime lobbying ban for officials", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T18:36:42.238+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
