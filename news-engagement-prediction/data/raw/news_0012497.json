But two Republican senators have also said they will not back her, leaving the vote tied at 50-50.\nIf it stays that way, Vice-President Mike Pence would cast the deciding vote - but one more Republican defector would mean Mrs DeVos not getting nominated (last week, the New York Times even went as far as appealing to \" one Republican with dignity \" to vote against her).\nLabour unions, rights groups and teaching organisations have also spoken out against her nomination.\nSo just why has she proven so unpopular?\nMrs DeVos, 59, is a wealthy Republican Party donor and a former Michigan Republican Party chairwoman who has long campaigned for education reform in the state.\nHer husband Dick DeVos was a CEO of the beauty and nutrition giant Amway and her brother is Erik Prince , the founder of the controversial private security company Blackwater.\nIt is not clear how much the DeVos family support Mr Trump or his agenda - in 2015, they gave money towards the campaigns of Jeb Bush and Wisconsin governor Scott Walker. And, in an interview last March, she described Mr Trump as \"an interloper\" who did not represent the Republican Party.\nTrump's second week: No let-up\nThe people around Donald Trump\nMrs DeVos has faced plenty of opposition, including by Eric Heins, the California Teachers Association president Much of the controversy around Mrs DeVos focuses on her support of charter schools, which are publicly funded and set up by teachers, parents, or community groups, outside the state school system.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said her work in Michigan involved \"elevating for-profit schools with no consideration of the severe harm done to traditional public schools\" despite \"overwhelming evidence\" that charter schools were no more successful than their traditional counterparts.\nShe and her family have also campaigned, albeit unsuccessfully, for a loosening of the oversight of charter schools in Michigan but it is unclear if this is a policy she would pursue further as education secretary.\nLess oversight of charter schools, critics say, would allow them to pursue a creationist, evangelical agenda. The New York Times reported that she had told a meeting of Christian philanthropists in 2001 that education reform was a way to \" advance God's kingdom \". Fusion reported that secularists in the US school system faced a \" fierce battle \" with Mrs DeVos at the helm.\nHow did Trump nominees' hearings go?\nAn editorial in the Detroit Free Press in December highlighted concerns in Michigan over her appointment.\n\"DeVos isn't an educator, or an education leader,\" it read . \"She's not an expert in pedagogy or curriculum or school governance. In fact, she has no relevant credentials or experience for a job setting standards and guiding dollars for the nation's public schools.\n\"She is, in essence, a lobbyist - someone who has used her extraordinary wealth to influence the conversation about education reform, and to bend that conversation to her ideological convictions despite the dearth of evidence supporting them.\"\nOne of the two Republican senators who said they could not support Mrs DeVos, Susan Collins of Maine, said she was \"concerned that Mrs DeVos' lack of experience with public schools will make it difficult for her to fully understand, identify and assist\" challenges facing rural schools in particular.\nThe concerns over her qualifications rose to the fore last month after a performance at her confirmation hearing that our reporter gave a polite C minus .\nIn perhaps the most uncomfortable moment, she struggled to show she was familiar with the Individuals With Disabilities in Education Act (Idea), a federal law that requires public schools to make accommodations for disabled students.\nThe American Association of People with Disabilities said it was \"very concerned\" that she seemed \"unfamiliar with the Idea and the protections it provides to students with disabilities\".\nIt was not the most striking moment of the session though - that was when Mrs DeVos, discussing whether to allow firearms in schools, noted that Wyoming classrooms might need guns to defend against bears.", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7807/production/_93972703_mediaitem93972702.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/29E7/production/_93972701_mediaitem93972700.jpg", "http://fusion.net/story/384152/trump-devos-falwell-change-education/?utm_campaign=ThisIsFusion&utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=social", "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/13/opinion/betsy-devos-and-gods-plan-for-schools.html", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38830514", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/opinion/wanted-one-republican-with-integrity-to-defeat-betsy-devos.html", "https://www.aclumich.org/article/aclu-raises-serious-concerns-over-nomination-devos-secretary-education", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7000645.stm", "http://www.freep.com/story/opinion/columnists/stephen-henderson/2016/12/03/betsy-devos-education-donald-trump/94728574/", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38671517"], "published": "2017-02-06T01:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:39:28.075+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
