After sending six handwritten stories to the University of Iowa, she was accepted into the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, where she studied with Philip Roth and Vance Bourjaily in her first year. She earned an M.F.A. in 1963 and a doctorate in comparative literature in 1969 at Iowa. She married Mr. Blaise, a fellow student, in 1963. Besides her husband, she is survived by their son, Bernard; two sisters, Mira Bakhle and Ranu Vanikar; and two granddaughters. “From those years I evolved a credo: Make the familiar exotic (Americans won’t recognize their country when I get finished with it) and make the exotic — the India of elephants and arranged marriages — familiar,” she wrote in Contemporary Authors. In 1966 Ms. Mukherjee and her husband moved to Montreal, where she taught at McGill University. They moved to Toronto in the late 1970s, but, fed up with the racial tensions she encountered there, they moved again, in 1980, this time to the United States, with Ms. Mukherjee firing a parting shot in a blistering essay, “An Invisible Woman,” published in the magazine Saturday Night. By then she had published her first two novels. “The Tiger’s Daughter” (1972), the most autobiographical of her works, told the story of an American-educated Indian woman who returns home to an India she no longer recognizes. She moved into less familiar territory with “Wife” (1975), taking as her main character a young Bengali woman who rebels against her arranged marriage after moving to New York. With the story collection “Darkness” (1985), Ms. Mukherjee began to attract critical notice for her discerning portraits of immigrants struggling to cast off the bonds of tradition and remake their lives. In “Jasmine,” her breakthrough novel, she painted a portrait of a character dear to her heart. “I think of Jasmine, and many of my characters, as being people who are pulling themselves out of the very traditional world in which their fate is predetermined, their destiny resigned to the stars,” she told the magazine Bomb in 1989. “Traditionally, a good person accepts this. But Jasmine says, ‘I’m going to reposition the stars.’” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story After years of short-term academic appointments, Ms. Mukherjee was hired in 1989 to teach postcolonial and world literature at the University of California, Berkeley. She then embarked on a series of expansive novels, with multiple plots and generations, starting with “The Holder of the World” (1993), a novel within a novel based in part on Hawthorne’s “The Scarlet Letter.” “Desirable Daughters” (2002), which traced the different fortunes of three sisters from Calcutta, was the first in a loosely joined trilogy of novels, the others being “The Tree Bride” (2004) and “Miss New India” (2011). Throughout, the restless, hopeful surge of immigration, and the mutability of cultures, gripped her imagination.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T07:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T03:44:26.124+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
