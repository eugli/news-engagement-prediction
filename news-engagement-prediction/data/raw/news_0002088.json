Its intestine \"had no food, only some remnants of a squid's head in addition to a thin fat layer.\" \nAFTER WALK ON THE WILD SIDE, BOBCAT IS DOING FINE AT THE NATIONAL ZOO \nLislevand says the non-biodegradable waste was \"probably the reason\" why the whale repeatedly beached Saturday in shallow waters off Sotra, an island west of Bergen, some 200 kilometers (125 miles) northwest of Oslo. \nHe said Friday the U.N. estimates 8 million tons of plastic trash are dumped into oceans each year. \nInformation on the whale's age or gender was not immediately available.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T19:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T14:44:06.605+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
