Yesterday, they shared “ Charm Assault ,” their first song in 20 years. Today, they’ve followed it up with another new one, “Home Is A Feeling.” And where “Charm Assault” was a relatively compact and straightforward rock song, “Home Is A Feeling” returns the band to their old sense of cosmic drift. Below, listen to the song and read what frontman Andy Bell has to say about it. \nBell says: \nOut of all the new songs “Home Is A Feeling” comes closest to the early Ride sound. We felt comfortable going vintage on this tune because the album we are making has a pretty broad sonic scope. It’s a short and sweet, melodic tune, with stacked harmonies, reverbed-out guitars, slowed down drums, and a huge distorted bass sound. Erol [Alkan, producer] put his sage-scented electronic wizards hat on to sample up some of our harmonies and make them into a synthesiser preset, which we ended up using on this and some of the other tunes too. We wanted this song to sound jet lagged, so everything on it was recorded with varispeed, either faster or slower than real time. It’s like 1966 Beatles meets 1988 MBV… in other words, Ride. \nRide’s new album is out this summer on Wichita .
