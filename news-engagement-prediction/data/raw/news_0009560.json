Even with Beyonce’s pregnant topless photos, I couldn’t focus on the good parts enough with that giant baby belly in there. So to me this is not sexy at all, not in the least (sorry to the pregnant chicks out there who want to continue being sexual beings with a human growing inside them but it’s not for this guy, bless you fetish weirdos’ hearts but no thanks). However I am extremely impressed with this girl doing all of those noteworthy things with her ass in front of a skeptical crowd. That’s the equivalent of the dude who came out of the stands to drill a putt at the Ryder Cup , no one expecting success and then going bananas when she somehow comes through. When she started moving those cheeks one by one, you could feel the excitement in the room from seeing something so unexpected, a perfect mix of the unexpected and dispelling stereotypes. Quite the moment as far as ass based dancing goes, an inspirational tale. \nPS #noracist for culturally appropriating twerking on Black History Month, I’d like to think most black dudes would appreciate this video enough to understand Chris Spags |", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T18:23:14.702+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
