Malta has a prime minister who has lost his effective control,\" Dr Fenech Adami said. \nShadow minister Jason Azzopardi said that the least the prime minister could do was to make sure that the claims of money laundering by his two collaborators were investigated by the police. \n\"The scandal is even more serious as the police, who are there to protect the people, failing their duty and only interested in covering up this scandal.\" \nDr Azzopardi quoted socialist MEP Anna Gomes who said that she was astonished that Konrad Mizzi had not yet resigned or sacked by Dr Muscat. « Husbands may take wives’ surname under new marriage law Advert \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T14:54:19.969+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
