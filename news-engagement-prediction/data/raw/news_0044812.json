Last November, following Michigan's 30-27 loss to Ohio State in \"The Game,\" a photo surfaced of Ohio State fans posing in front of a sign that said \"Michigan girls: More diseased than Flint water,\" sparking outrage from many. \n\"Family Guy,\" created by actor and producer Seth MacFarlane, debuted in 1999 and has long been known to test the boundaries of comedy. It has aired for 15 seasons and produced more than 280 episodes. \nRead more: Flint water documentary: It's still not over \nContact Brian Manzullo: bmanzullo@freepress.com.
