PUBLISHED: 13:21,  27, Wed, Feb 15, 2017 \nUsain Bolt is known to be a football fanatic and Manchester United fan and has often spoken about getting into the sport. \nThe 100m champion has taken steps to break into the world of professional football and has lined up training sessions with Borussia Dortmund. \nAnd the 30-year-old is confident he could make it as a pro, brazenly claiming he could be as good as Wayne Rooney. \n\"I'm going to get a chance to train at Dortmund, which is good,\" Bolt said. \n\"I think I'll go there for a week, just to train and feel it out. \n\"I've had people suggest different teams and suggest ways we can get into football. We've been looking into those things, but we're not sure what's going on yet. \n\"But at any level, I just want to see if I'd be any good, because I play football all the time with my friends and I think I'm at a good level. \n\"If I train and put some good work in I think I could be pretty good. \n\"I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna say I'm going to be the best footballer in the world. \n\"But I'd be at a good level, I'd say. Maybe Wayne Rooney level.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T20:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T15:32:43.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
