It means that there could be some serious outcome. If there is due cause‚ people will be sanctioned‚” she said. \n“The investigation is basically to see what transpired and then what role did the individuals have in this incident.” \nOn Sunday‚ Rapport said Josh Jordaan‚ policy and strategy researcher in De Lille’s office‚ gave one of its journalists an official document with vital information omitted. \nIt was reportedly offered as proof that August and fellow Cape Town councillor Matthew Kempthorne were victims of a hate campaign after they were found guilty by the DA federal executive of failing to follow proper procedures in the procurement of party T-shirts in the run-up to last year's local government elections. \nThey were fined about R50‚000 each and given suspended membership terminations. Jordaan resigned from the party on Monday. \nDA federal executive chairman James Selfe said the leak of the documentation was “in violation of the party’s policy on the confidentiality of closed meetings”. \nHe said: “According to the story‚ this was done with the knowledge of Shaun August‚ and Patricia De Lille was aware that he was meeting with the paper. \n“I have accordingly referred the matter to the DA’s federal legal commission for investigation‚ in particular to determine the role played in the matter by Shaun August‚ Patricia De Lille‚ and Josh Jordaan.” \nSelfe said there were “no suspensions of any person” amid media reports that De Lille had been handed a letter of expulsion. \nFive candidates are campaigning to succeed De Lille‚ but analysts say the main race is between August and human settlements MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela‚ who has the support of Premier Helen Zille. \nTMG Digital/TimesLIVE Tweet SHARE YOUR OPINION If you have an opinion you would like to share on this article, please to the Times LIVE iLIVE team.
