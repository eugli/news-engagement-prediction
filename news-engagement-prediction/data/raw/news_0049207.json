The Easter Bunny Or This Australian Bilby? Aussies love their Easter Bilbies and shun pesky rabbits. Zoos South Austrailia This is the preferred Easter animal among fans in the land Down Under. \nHere comes Peter Bilby-Tail, hopping down the marsupial trail. That’s what Aussies have in mind as spring approaches and they prepare to to shun bunnies again and celebrate an approaching holiday with their own native Easter Bilby . \nIt’s been a long battle, and largely successful. Locals have taken the rabbit-sized native with huge ears and a pointy nose to heart. Australian kids now devour chocolate bilbies (which are also called rabbit bandicoots). Companies like Haigh’s Chocolates, which created the first chocolate Easter Bilby over two decades ago, donate a portion of their proceeds to helping save the species . Courtesy Haighs Chocolates A different kind of Easter fare. \nBunnies are generally not beloved Down Under . They were imported by Europeans almost 200 years ago to become an invasive, destructive pest. The rapacious rabbits famously inspired a six-year construction project resulting in the world longest “rabbit-proof” fence in western Australia. It didn’t really do the trick. \nThe idea to dethrone the Easter Bunny was born in 1968 when a 9-year-old Queensland girl wrote a story called “Billy The Aussie Easter Bilby,” which eventually became a book. The campaign was officially launched in 1991 by members of a group called Rabbit-Free Australia, who approached artist/author/environmentalist Kaye Kessing in 1993 to create a children’s picture book called “ The Easter Bilby .” The bilby of the book does everything the Easter bunny does, but it’s a native Australian. Lots of other bilby books by other authors followed.

Backing the seasonal hero is listed as one of the group’s key projects on its web site to “ensure [that] the ‘bilbies not bunnies’ message is widely promoted and understood.” \nEven Britain’s baby Prince George was wooed into the bilby camp after one of the animals in the Sydney Taronga Zoo was named after him. POOL New / Reuters Baby Prince George checks out a bilby named after him at Taronga Zoo in Sydney in 2014 with mum and dad. \nThere are only an estimated 600 of the creatures left in the wild in the west and central deserts of Australia currently, due to predation by feral cats. But they have been also hunted by foxes and driven from their burrows by the aggressive rabbits. Bilby backers hope elevating their status during Easter will help.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T15:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T10:53:40.045+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
