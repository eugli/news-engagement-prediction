What started out as a modest exhibition in 2013 has now become one of the landmark events for art enthusiasts every year. Even though we only managed to catch the last day of the fair, the venue–occupying three floors along with the roof deck–was still packed. Outside, the queue went all around the building until right before the event ended at 9PM. Despite the large crowd and having to dodge a lot of selfie-takers posing in front of the artwork on display, we managed to squeeze our way through the venue and take in “the best in contemporary Philippine art”. \nHere are some of our favorite artworks from the fair: \n1. These ceramics from Mark Valenzuela’s “New Folk Heroes” collection: \n\n2. This dual work (oil on canvas/sculpture) entitled “Orphan” by Renato Borja Jr.: PAULINE REYES/ INQUIRER.net \n3. This fun collage (mixed media on canvas) called “Rolly the Curly in Board Shorts” by Richard Quebral: PAULINE REYES/ INQUIRER.net \n4.
