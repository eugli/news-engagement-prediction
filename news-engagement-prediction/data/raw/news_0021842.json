Producer Jerry Wexler paired her with the famed Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, who prompted some of her most soulful, fiery performances.\nBy 1968, she was renowned throughout America and Europe as \"Lady Soul\" - a symbol of black pride, who was presented an award by Martin Luther King, and appeared on the cover of Time.\nAlthough she faltered in the era of disco, an appearance in cult comedy The Blues Brothers brought her back into the public eye and she scored a number of big hits in the 1980s, including Who's Zooming Who? and the George Michael duet, I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me).\nShe has continued to record and perform since, and two years ago, the star reduced President Obama to tears when she performed (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman at the Kennedy Center Honours ceremony.\nFollow us on Facebook , on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts , or on Instagram at bbcnewsents .
