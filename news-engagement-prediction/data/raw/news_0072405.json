The only people on the train will be you and the musical artist or podcaster of your choice. 2. An external USB battery \nAmazon \nFew things are as frustrating as having your phone die on your commute home. All you want to do is kill time reading those articles you've been putting off all day, and now you're face to face with a blank screen. \nAnker's USB battery is compact enough to fit in a small backpack compartment or purse, and has enough juice to fully recharge most phones a couple of times over. 3. A handheld game console \nAmazon \nI tend to keep my gaming to home consoles these days, but I have friends who swear by playing games on their commute. \nThe Nintendo 3DS has an exceptional library of games, and can still be slipped in and out of a backpack pocket or purse with ease. If you haven't owned a Nintendo handheld in a little while, you'll need to buy a power adapter for this one, but after that it's smooth sailing. 4. A clear iPhone 7 case \nAmazon \nA clear iPhone case might seem like a weird commuter-centric choice, unless you've ridden the train twice a day during the winter. \nInstead of reaching into your pocket for your wallet, you can slip your train ticket into the clear case and flash it to the conductor. This saves time and frustration, especially since most of us have our phones in our hands while commuting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:15:32.654+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
