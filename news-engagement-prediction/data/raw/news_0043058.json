Young mum reveals how baby boy detected her cancer while breastfeeding \nThe test came back positive and a doctor later confirmed that she was four weeks ‘gone’. \nWriting in a piece for The Sunday Mirror , Alice said that though her and Christopher were young, they were still thrilled and knew they’d step up and become good parents when the time came. \nThey even came up with possible names. The couple had already toyed with possible names for their baby (Picture: Sunday Mirror) \nBut just eight weeks in, Alice started bleeding so rushed to her doctors, who then referred her to Hereford County Hospital for a scan. Father’s entire body covered in tumours that frighten children away \nMedics told her she was having a miscarriage but surprisingly, a pregnancy test confirmed that she was still pregnant. \nShe explained: ‘My uterus thought there was a baby in there as my body was mimicking the symptoms of pregnancy.’ \nAlice returned the next day for more tests which revealed that she was indeed pregnant and doctors said she probably just had a miscarriage scare. \nBut a week later, the pain returned. What is Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia (GTN)? GTN is incredibly rare with only an estimated 120 patients a year being diagnosed with it. It occurs when the placenta and foetus do not form properly and a baby does not develop. It can simulate pregnancy because the uterus may contain foetal tissue which grows at the same rate as a normal pregnancy. While GTD overwhelmingly affects women of child-bearing age, it may rarely occur in postmenopausal women. \nThe 20 year old said: ‘They thought I was having an ectopic pregnancy, where the foetus grows inside the Fallopian tube instead of the womb, so I underwent a keyhole laparoscopy so doctors could have a look around inside.’ \nWhen they did though, they ruled out the possibility of her being pregnant almost immediately but did not know what the swelling in her womb was. \n‘I felt relieved they didn’t think it was an ectopic pregnancy but was devastated to learn that I wasn’t pregnant any longer. It was so upsetting, my emotions had been everywhere and I cried for the baby I’d lost’, she said. \nIt was so upsetting, my emotions had been everywhere and I cried for the baby I’d lost.’ \nAfter a few more tests, doctors diagnosed her with gestational tropho-blastic neoplasia (GTN), which had caused a tumour to grow in the womb. \nTwo weeks later, Alice was taken for a chest X-ray and a full body MRI which showed there was a tumour the size of a foetus in her uterus and a biopsy confirmed that it was cancerous. \nMORE: Schoolgirl died from brain tumour after GP said she was just suffering from ‘exam stress’ Alice was referred to Hereford County Hospital for a scan (Picture: Rex) \nShe was given eight sessions of a low-dose chemotherapy which stopped the tumour from growing but things got worse when she woke up in excruciating pain in September. \nWhen she called her doctor, she was told that she was effectively in labour. Heartbreaking photograph shows baby tied to bed after airstrike killed her mother \nAlice said: ‘I was taken to Hereford County Hospital and told I’d have to give “birth” to the tumour , which weighed around one pound. It was really traumatic.’ \nAfter 30 hours, she managed to remove the tumour on the toilet and a few months later, she was given the all-clear and is now in remission. \nHer and Christopher plan to try for a baby once she is fully recovered.
