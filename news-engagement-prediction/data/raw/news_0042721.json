Or is it? Leave it to Alexa Chung to infuse an above-shoulder chop with fresh It-Brit cool—just in time for London Fashion Week . Back in town for the shows, the East Village’s chicest expat made a pit stop at longtime hairstylist and friend George Northwood’s salon for a French braid that transformed her ombré waves. The look—which she called out on Instagram—made the most of every inch of her shoulder-length bob, which she paired with relaxed jeans and a leather jacket before taking her seat at J.W.Anderson . Finished with a few face-framing strands and fastened with a haphazardly bound elastic, the style channeled the kind of laissez-faire girl who crafts a good hair situation en route to the show—and knows how to make magic out of bedhead. Given Chung’s fondness for a good air dry, the ease of this plait will likely inspire her to add the look to her roster of trend-sparking DIY styles once she’s back stateside. Ready to take fashion’s favorite haircut to the next level? Where there’s a will, there’s a braid.
