The jewellery will have been worn by powerful members of society (Photo: PA) It will give historians an insight into Iron Age Britain (Photo: PA) The pieces are yet to be valued (Photo: PA) \nDr Julia Farley, curator of British and European Iron Age collections for the British Museum, said: \"This unique find is of international importance. It dates to around 400-250 BC, and is probably the earliest Iron Age gold work ever discovered in Britain. \n\"The torcs were probably worn by wealthy and powerful women, perhaps people from the continent who had married into the local community. \n\"Piecing together how these objects came to be carefully buried in a Staffordshire field will give us an invaluable insight into life in Iron Age Britain.\" \nStaffordshire County Council leader Philip Atkins said: \"As a county and as a council we are both proud and unbelievably lucky to be home to some truly exceptional finds, including of course the Staffordshire Hoard of Anglo-Saxon gold. Metal detectorists Joe Kania (left) and Mark Hambleton (Photo: PA) \n\"This amazing find of gold torcs in the north of the county is quite simply magical and we look forward to sharing the secrets and story they hold in the years to come.\" \nThe finds, which were probably made in Europe, have been handed over to the Portable Antiquities Scheme, part of Birmingham Museums, which manages the voluntary recording of finds. \nAn inquest will be held at 11am in North Staffordshire, where coroner Ian Smith will rule if the pieces are treasure. \nThe pieces will then be provisionally valued by an expert.
