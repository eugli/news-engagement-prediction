It is disproportionate and we need a new system which was agreed under the Stormont Agreement.\"\nIhat will be wound up after Phil Shiner, the human rights lawyer who brought most of the Iraq cases, was earlier this month struck off after being found guilty of recklessness, dishonesty and lack of integrity.\nMr Brokenshire said it was “appalling when people try to make a business of dragging our brave troops through the courts”.\nMr Brokenshire said the current investigations in Northern Ireland “are simply not delivering for anyone, including victims and survivors on all sides who suffered most during the Troubles”.\nA new Historical Investigations Unit to replace current inquiries run by Northern Ireland police will be legally obliged to be “fair, balanced and crucially proportionate”, he said.\nThe unit would have to look at terrorist attacks on troops, such as the 1979 Warrenpoint ambush which killed 18 soldiers, he said.\nHe said: “We are looking at ways of ensuring that where prosecutions do take place terrorists are not treated more favourably than former soldiers and police officers.\n“And the bodies will be time limited to five years, ensuring that this process will not be open ended thereby helping Northern Ireland to move forward.”\nMr Brokenshire also said the new system would consider giving legal support to witnesses called to testify in cases involving their comrades - something which currently does not happen.\nJim Shannon MP, broke down in tears as he recalled his cousin, who had been killed by the IRA.\nThe Strangford MP who served in the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) during the Troubles, said: “I understand very well the concept of closure and wanting justice.\n\"I want justice for my cousin Kenneth Smith, who was murdered by the IRA.\"\n\"I want justice for the four UDR men that the honourable member refers to, a few of whom I knew personally.\n\"And yet there's no multimillion pound investigation available for that.\n\"So I resent the idea that this seems to once more represent that one life is worth more than another. \"It's not, never will be.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:18:18.759+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
