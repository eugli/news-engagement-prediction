Tejada inspired girls from ASET with her personal success story. (Mike Groll/Mike Groll) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS  33 PM \nThey weren't sure it could be done, but these homeless girls now know — without a doubt — what can be accomplished. \nThey know there’s a place for them. \nTwenty-five girls from city high schools got the pep talk of a lifetime this week when they went to visit shelter-kid-turned-college-student Angely Tejada as part of a three-day tour of upstate colleges. The 19-year-old freshman at the State University of New York at Delhi, told the determined teens to follow their dreams right out of the shelter system and into college. \n“You’ve got to keep trying and never give up,” said Tejada, who met the girls Monday for an informal talk before their official campus tour. “It was hard, but you’ll survive — believe me.” \nThe kids who visited Tejada on Monday are members of All Sisters Evolving Together, a unique club for homeless high school girls that’s run by city social workers. Alisha Britton (l.), Ivory Parker (c.) and Paishunce Montero took a campus tour at SUNY Delhi. (Mike Groll/Mike Groll) \nASET members attend schools across the city and live in a variety of temporary housing, ranging from shelters to the homes of relatives and friends. \nThe girls were amazed to meet Tejada, whose inspiring journey from a Harlem shelter to SUNY was chronicled in a series of Daily News stories that began in August when she left for college. \nTejada was once one of them, just another city kid living in a shelter — but she escaped the system and now she’s making good on her college dreams. \nThe message — and the proof — weren’t lost on the girls who went to see her. \n“It shows that we can do it, too,” said Ivory Parker, 17, an ASET member and senior at Brooklyn’s Medgar Evers College Preparatory School who boasts an 85 average. \n“No matter your circumstances, there is always hope and you can always achieve your goal of going to college and pursuing a career,” said Parker, who lives in an East New York shelter with her mother and two sisters and plans to study criminal justice when she graduates. \nIvory and the others on the trip are but a few success stories among the city’s record 105,445 homeless kids in public schools. Though the wins come one kid at a time, each victory is huge. Tejada came from a Harlem shelter to fulfill her college dreams. (Mike Groll/Mike Groll) \nWhile Ivory’s group visited campuses, three dozen homeless boys took their own trip to other upstate colleges. The boys are in a club called Safe In My Brother’s Arms, or SIMBA. Like ASET, SIMBA was created by Wayne Harris, a veteran city Education Department social worker. \nBoth clubs meet a number of times each week, giving students a mix of support group-style teambuilding, academic lessons and tips for college- and career-readiness. \nThe city has rolled out numerous supports for homeless kids in recent years, including $30 million worth of services such as tutoring and busing in the 2016-17 school year alone. \nBut Wayne Harris said the clubs and their college visits serve a special purpose. \n“The overall goal is that they are college- or career-ready and become good citizens,” he said. “The kids really land in some great places.” The girls are now filled with hope that they, too, can make it to college. (Mike Groll/Mike Groll) \nKids count \nThe following are facts about homelessness in city schools: \n* A record 105,445 homeless kids attended city schools in the 2015-16 year. That’s up 22% from 86,694 during the previous school year. \n* That 2015-16 total is more than double the 2007-08 population of 50,926 homeless students. Although part of the national recession coincided with that school year, the effects of the economy collapsing were not yet fully realized. \n* The city will spend roughly $30 million on supports for homeless kids for the current school year that ends in June. \n* About 1.1 million students are enrolled in city schools. \nSOURCES: New York State Technical and Education Assistance Center for Homeless Students, New York City Education Department Join the Conversation:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T10:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:55:19.336+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
