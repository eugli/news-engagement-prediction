Share via Twitter Lindsey Paradiso via Facebook This October, Lindsey Paradiso took a brave step. The Fredericksburg, Virginia, photographer went public with the story of her late-term abortion on Facebook. What prompted her to do it: now-President Donald Trump's comments about abortion in the final presidential debate . During the debate, Trump said, \"I am pro-life,\" and confirmed his commitment to pro-life politics. Trump also inaccurately described late-term abortions during the debate as a procedure that allows people to \"take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day.\" As a woman who went through a heartbreaking late-term abortion at 23 weeks, Paradiso was furious at Trump's comments. So she shared her story to show what a late-term abortion is really like. And now, as legislators in Virginia debate a proposed bill to ban abortion after 20 weeks, Paradiso's powerful post is resurfacing again. Her post—which is a series of photos and videos—starts with a photo of her positive pregnancy test from November 2015, followed by a happy video of her sharing the good news with her husband, Matt. There's a photo of her wearing maternity pants for the first time, and then the first ultrasound of the fetus, a girl which the couple named Omara. Paradiso's pregnancy was going fine until she reached 18 weeks. Then, an ultrasound revealed a \"bubble\" on the fetus's neck. At first, doctors thought it was a treatable tumor called a teratoma , and Paradiso and her husband were hopeful that the fetus could survive. But further tests and ultrasounds over the next few weeks confirmed that the fetus had lymphangioma, which is a rare non-cancerous congenital tumor that can involve the head and neck and can cause fatal swelling and obstruct airways. \"We learned that Omara had an aggressive lymphangioma that was growing out of her neck (at her carotid artery) and back into the back of her neck, her chest, her mouth and the orbit of her right eye,\" Paradiso wrote on her blog . \"Omi's was growing quite quickly and was endangering her lungs, eye and brain.\" Doctors gave Paradiso a grim prognosis for the pregnancy, saying that the fetus most likely wouldn't survive past 27 weeks, a time when the fetus could be viable for delivery and potential life-saving operations. \"Her chances of living to birth or even the age of viability are very small,\" Paradiso blogged. \"If she does manage to make it to [more than] 27 weeks and the doctors are able to secure an airway at birth, the life she would have is not one I would wish on my worst enemy.\" If Paradiso waited to carry the pregnancy to term, she'd likely be carrying a deceased fetus for a period of time. And if she waited until 27 weeks, she'd have to give birth via an EXIT Procedure —which is similar to a Cesarean section —rather than vaginally. An EXIT Procedure allows doctors to deliver a baby while it's still attached to the placenta. Then, the placenta can provide oxygen and nutrients to the baby while doctors work to establish an airway and/or remove a mass, like a tumor, on the newborn. But Paradiso was told the procedure could affect future pregnancies. \"I was willing to risk never having kids again with the EXIT procedure if it meant Omi could survive,\" Paradiso told BuzzFeed . \"But now that we knew she would probably die before viability, the thought of also being infertile was too much for us.\" As the fetus's lymphangioma continued to grow, Paradiso and her husband made the difficult decision to have a late-term abortion. The couple traveled an hour to another doctor because Paradiso's ob/gyn couldn't perform the procedure. \"We were lucky, because a lot of parts of Virginia are very restrictive,\" Paradiso told BuzzFeed. On February 26—at week 23 of her pregnancy—doctors gave the fetus a lethal injection and induced Paradiso's labor. Paradiso was in labor for almost 40 hours before delivery. It was a difficult process, but the late-term abortion gave Paradiso and her husband the chance to say goodbye. \"We opted to end the pregnancy early, relieve the suffering that she and our family were experiencing and deliver her through labor fully intact,\" Paradiso wrote on her Facebook post. \"Because of this decision we were able to hold her and say goodbye.\" Paradiso wrote on Facebook that she wanted to share her story to show that late-term abortions aren't \"wanted,\" a \"way out,\" or a means of \"birth control\"—\"It was heartbreaking,\" Paradiso wrote. And she doesn't want the government interfering with late-term abortions. Currently, 16 states ban abortion after 20 weeks, many on the grounds that fetuses can \"feel pain\" at that time in gestation (some states allow later abortions under certain situations, like the life and physical health of the mother). But the Guttmacher Institute calls the \"fetus pain\" claim false, and the American Congress of Obstetrics and Gynecologists has also said there's \"no legitimate scientific data or information that supports the statement that a fetus experiences pain at 20 weeks’ gestation.\" Additionally, it's important to know that late-term abortions, like Paradiso's, aren't common. The Guttmacher Institute estimates that slightly more than 1 percent of abortions are performed at 21 weeks or later. And many women opting for late-term abortions do so because of fetal medical conditions or because the pregnancy is posing a threat to their health. Since Paradiso posted her story on Facebook in October, it's been shared more than 115,000 times. Commenters have shared their condolences, and some have even said that stories like Paradiso's have changed their view of late-term abortions. \"I used to believe late-term abortions should not be allowed,\" one commenter wrote. \"It was another courageous couple sharing a story similar to yours that changed my opinion...It should always remain the decision between the parents and their doctor.\" Read Paradiso's viral post for yourself below.
