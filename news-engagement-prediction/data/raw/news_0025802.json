Yet the two events, held at sports venues just seven kilometres apart in Madrid’s southern suburbs, served to highlight the parties’ differing prospects. In a climate of self-congratulation, Mariano Rajoy, Spain’s prime minister, was re-elected as the PP president, unopposed and with a Soviet-style margin of 96% of the vote of delegates. Mr Iglesias triumphed, too, but only after a bitter internal battle against his more moderate number two, Iñigo Errejón. The outcome suggests that Podemos (“We can” in Spanish) may retreat to the hard left and the politics of permanent protest. Mr Iglesias was easily re-elected as Podemos’s secretary-general; more importantly, his political programme was approved and his allies won 37 of the 62 seats on the party’s ruling council. Mr Errejón, who looked glum at the closing ceremony on February 12th, was relegated to third place in the vote for the council. Although he was backed by around a third of the 155,000 supporters who voted, his powerful post of political secretary is likely to be scrapped and he may be replaced as Podemos’s parliamentary spokesperson. Founded in 2014 by a group of political-science professors in the aftermath of the anti-austerity protests of the indignados, Podemos quickly turned Spanish politics upside down. In a general election in December 2015 the new party won 5.2m votes, or 21% of the total, thus helping to deprive Mr Rajoy of his parliamentary majority. Since then Podemos has stalled. Talks on forming a government with the Socialist Party (PSOE) broke down. For the election that followed last June, Mr Iglesias pushed through an alliance with the former Communist Party. But the alliance secured 1.1m less votes than its constituent parts had managed in December, and failed in its aim of overtaking the Socialists to become the biggest party on the left. These setbacks triggered an increasingly public dispute over strategy. Mr Errejón believed Podemos’s future lay in more inclusive politics. “We risk committing some of the mistakes of the traditional left in Spain,” he told El Diario , an online newspaper, referring to its sectarianism and top-down leadership. Mr Iglesias, by contrast, argued that Podemos should continue to mobilise popular anger against public-spending cuts, unemployment and corruption. Its 71 congressional deputies should be “activists”, he said. He denounced the Socialists for having abstained last October to allow Mr Rajoy to form a minority government in a parliamentary vote he described as “a mafia coup”. Podemos has at least saved itself from an open split. Mr Iglesias had threatened to resign if he lost the battle over the party programme. Delegates at the Congress, held in a covered former bullring, repeatedly broke into chants of “unity”. But when, in victory, Mr Iglesias called for “unity and humility”, that sounded like a warning to his defeated rival. Both the PP and, especially, the Socialists will be relieved at the outcome. Several speakers at the PP Congress poured scorn on Podemos’s populism. The Socialists, leaderless until their own Congress in June, saw Mr Errejón as a more dangerous rival. But Podemos will not disappear. Many younger Spaniards, whose lives have been blighted by austerity and recession, will not easily regain faith in the traditional parties. On February 10th, a court sentenced one of the party’s former low-level fixers for corruption. However Mr Rajoy’s pitch to his country is that his unpopular reforms have engendered a strong economic recovery. “We are an example of success in difficult times for Europe,” he wrote before the Congress. “And we are a mature society that has managed to overcome the siren song of populism.” For now, at least, that appears to be the case.
