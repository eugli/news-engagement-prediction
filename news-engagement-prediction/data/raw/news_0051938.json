While the little streaming dongle still won't admit 4K is a thing , it boasts a quad-core processor that Amazon says makes it 30 percent faster than the previous generation of Fire TV Stick. Navigating around the new \"cinematic\" Fire UI should be pretty slick, then. The £40 steamer also supports the speedy 802.11ac WiFi protocol, but the biggest upgrade has to be the snazzy new Alexa remote. \nBy talking into the remote's microphone, Alexa won't just help you search for sci-fi B movies, open apps or skip through the opening credits of House of Cards . You get access too all manner of Alexa skills, meaning you can check the weather, control your smart home, play Prince's greatest hits or order an Uber , all by barking into your new flicker. \nThe latest Fire TV Stick will be available at outlets including Dixons Carphone, Argos, John Lewis, Tesco and Maplin, but you can also pre-order one from Amazon right now for £40, with deliveries beginning April 6th.
