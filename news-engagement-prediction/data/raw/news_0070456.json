Jim Boeheim (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 7:41 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 7:41 p.m. ET \nIt's not a question of if Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim is approaching retirement but when he will actually call it quits. \nFollowing Wednesday's stressful, last-second win over Duke that likely clinched the Orange a spot in the NCAA Tournament, Boeheim admitted he could be finished after this season. \nMORE: Dick Vitale’s call of Syracuse’s buzzer-beater win over Duke has all the March Madness feels \n“I don’t know what’s etched in stone these days,” Boeheim said Thursday on the Dan Patrick Show . “I really don’t. There’s a plan in place, and we’re going to see what happens. But basically right now, I might be done this year. You just don’t know. You just have to wait until the season’s over.” \nBack in 2015, Boeheim, now 72, told the school he would step down after next season in wake of the school's NCAA sanctions. ’Cuse is planning for assistant coach Mike Hopkins to take over the program but Sports Illustrated reported Tuesday that Boeheim wants to remain as coach and plot his own exit. \nUnofficially, Boeheim has 1,002 wins following Wednesday's win but technically Syracuse was forced to vacate 101 of those wins for violations committed from 2004-2012. Boeheim can add plenty of victories to his Hall of Fame career if the Orange (17-12) can emulate last season's incredible run to the Final Four.
