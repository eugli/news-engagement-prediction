SEE ALSO: Animal shelter commercial almost cuter than the animals themselves \nThat's why online personality Obvious Plant decided to use his carefully-honed planting skills to create some eye-catching name tags for the shelter cats at Sante D'Or animal shelter in Los Angeles. \nOn each name tag, there's a flattering picture of the cat, the cat's name and then a section detailing the very specific likes and dislikes of that cat. \nObvious Plant does exactly what his name suggests - he plants hilarious objects in random places and documents his hijinks on his Tumblr and Instagram . Past plants include leaving parody CDs at a local music store and fake pamphlets at a national park. \nThis animal shelter prank is definitely his most touching plant to date, and also very amusing. As for the cats, they are ridiculously relatable. \nImage: obvious plant/facebook \nImage: obvious plant/facebook \nAs you can expect, the animal shelter discovered these name tags and were actually not mad about them. \n\"Thanks for the shout out. Please stop by and see the cats in person. We'd love to chat,\" the animal shelter commented on the Facebook post. \nThen, the shelter pointed out an error in one of Obvious Plant's name tags. \"However, Obi is a huge fan of improv comedy...\" \nHey, we all make mistakes. We also all want to adopt these cats now.
