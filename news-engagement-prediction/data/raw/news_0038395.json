(Photo: David Kadlubowski/azcentral sports) \n534 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 3 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Mark Grace’s separation from the Diamondbacks didn’t last long.\nAfter losing his job on the coaching staff in November, Grace on Wednesday was named an analyst for Fox Sports Arizona’s pregame and postgame shows.\nFor Grace, who was the first baseman on the Diamondbacks’ 2001 championship team, it’s not only a return to the organization, it’s a return to the broadcast booth, where he worked for parts of nine seasons as the team’s primary television analyst.\nREACTION: Mark Grace returning to Diamondbacks television \nSOCIAL: Follow azcentral sports on Facebook | Twitter \n“After a six- or seven-year hiatus, I’ll have to learn life with a microphone in your hand again,” Grace said. “It’s pregame and postgame, a few home games here and there; I don’t know exactly how many games yet. But it’ll be good. It keeps you around. It keeps you seen, keeps you heard. It keeps you around the Arizona Diamondbacks. This is the organization I really love.”\nFROM THE ARCHIVES: D-Backs announce Grace, Sutton will not return \nGrace, whose 16-year major league playing career ended in 2003, worked for the Diamondbacks as television analyst from 2004-12 alongside play-by-play announcers Thom Brennaman and Daron Sutton.\nGrace lost his broadcasting gig after receiving two DUIs in a 15-month span. The organization brought him back in 2013, giving him second life as a minor league coach. After two years in that capacity, he returned the big leagues in 2015 as the assistant hitting coach.\nBut he was let go last offseason after Torey Lovullo took over as manager. Grace said the news hurt but that he understands it.\nFROM THE ARCHIVES: Former TV analyst Mark Grace comments on firing \n“It’s never easy, but that’s the way baseball is,” he said. “When changes are made in the front office, obviously they’re going to bring their people in that they know and they trust. I know if I was ever a manager, I’d want to bring in my own guys. Baseball has been doing that for a century. That’s part of the game.”\nHe said he’d still be open to a return to coaching.\n“We’ll see,” Grace said. “You never close that door, never close that window if you can help it. I really enjoyed the coaching gig. That’s on the back burner now. Now I’ve got to do the best we can with the TV stuff now again.”\nMORE: Where are D-Backs in power rankings? | How many wins for D-Backs? \n“We are excited to be able to welcome Mark Grace to the FOX Sports Arizona family,” Fox Sports Arizona Senior Vice President and General Manager Brian Hogan said in a release.\nHe is scheduled to make his debut on Friday, March 31. The Diamondbacks host the Cleveland Indians at Chase Field in their final spring training game that night. TV coverage is scheduled to begin at 6 p.m. on Fox Sports Arizona Plus.\nReach Piecoro at (602) 444-8680 or nick.piecoro@arizonarepublic.com.
