(Junette Reyes/Staff) Junette Reyes visited the school in Sunrise for a day of fun activities including face painting, arts and crafts, puppet-making, and bean bag toss.\nEllen Kaplan, the school's ESE specialist, said the idea was to help improve the students' academic, social, independent functioning, and communication skills, as well as their self-esteem. \n\"It is definitely an educational activity but there's no reason we can't have fun while we're learning,\" Kaplan said. \nThe collaboration between the university and Nob Hill was spearheaded by junior Kaitlin Vargas. Vargas was recently crowned Miss FIU and planned the visit as her first official service mixer. \n\"I decided to come here at Nob Hill Elementary to be able to have a great interactive experience for the children,\" Vargas said. \"It took a lot of hard work and effort but it's all being paid off by seeing the smiles on all these kids' faces.\" Sunrise fugitive nabbed in Arizona \nJuan Lahera has been accused in a 2011 Sunrise home invasion in which a dog was shot and his alleged cohort drowned while trying to escape. \nJuan Lahera has been accused in a 2011 Sunrise home invasion in which a dog was shot and his alleged cohort drowned while trying to escape.

She also has a personal connection that drives her to help children with disabilities. \n\"I have four cousins who have disabilities, so this is definitely something that I do hold really close to my heart and I'm very passionate about,\" Vargas said. \nMiss FIU was joined by her counterpart, Diego Cardenas, the recently crowned Mr. FIU. The international student from Curacao chose The Ability Experience for his cause, which is the charity his fraternity Pi Kappa Phi contributes to. \n\"It was very exciting for us both to have the chance to win and actually have kind of the same platform,\" Cardenas said. \"That way we can work together and make big things happen.\" \nBoth students brought along volunteers from their sorority and fraternity to help out during the day. The activities were spread across three classrooms at the elementary school with the students rotating through each. \n\"It is crazy how much fun you can have with a bubble machine,\" Cardenas said. \"I got stuck in there for at least 20 minutes, just trying to pop bubbles with the kids.\" \nPrincipal Jeannie Floyd said the school is grateful for the university students' efforts on making the day special for the kids. \n\"We're excited that FIU students have taken on the challenge to involve them in a different way through engaging activities that will stimulate their continued growth and development,\" said Floyd.
