It must include Investigation of all unlawful death, accountability, reparation,” Callamard said on her Twitter account. ADVERTISEMENT \nCallamard has expressed interest in conducting an inquiry into the drug-related killings in the country, but the plan has hit a snag. READ: Duterte’s terms for UN rapporteur unacceptable; visit is canceled \nThe Philippines’ invitation to her came with conditions from President Duterte, including a public debate with him. \nCallamard had asked the government to lift the restrictions, saying they run counter to the terms of reference and code of conduct for rapporteurs. \nBut Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay earlier said the Philippine government would insist on the conditions.
