III John Carroll University in Cleveland, the alma mater of Hall of Fame coach Don Shula and Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels. \nStaley had been hired for the same role at Tennessee-Chattanooga when ex-John Carroll coach Tom Arth was hired there in December. Arth had a stint as a quarterback with the Colts in the early 2000s. \nThough most coaching openings across the league have been filled, the Bears have been busy this week filling out their staff. Zach Azzanni will be the team’s new wide receivers coach, and Derius Swinton will return as assistant special teams coach after he was the 49ers’ special teams coach last season. \nStaley replaces Clint Hurtt, who is now the Seahawks’ defensive line coach.
