The story has been sped up so Lucy and Isobel can be there. \n‘I think that there might be something later on but that’s obviously just our opinion, we don’t actually know. We’ve got the storyline in prison and there’s loads more to come before we even think about it.’ \nBoss Iain appeared to be on the same wavelength. He added: ‘It’s inferred that it’s not an “official wedding” so a little sneaky part of me thought we could have two bites of the cherry here if possible although there are no firm plans for part two in place. It feels like, in time they will want to sign and seal the deal legally. We sort of want to have our wedding cake and eat it.’ \nSo do we! All the press event gossip! \nIn case you missed any, here are links to all of the articles from the Emmerdale press event. \nFirst details of Chas’ exit revealed ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T13:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:40:05.401+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
