Otherwise, they are deprived.\" \"If you want to maintain the development, free textbooks, community clinic services, rehabilitation after losing homes to river erosion, then vote for the Awami League candidates with the boat symbol in the 2019 elections,\" she said.\nHasina thanked the people of Santahar for electing Awami League candidates in local government polls. \nThe prime minister also inaugurated the Nandigram Upazila Complex Extension Building and Hall, the Shahjahanpur Thana and Education for Visual Disabilities building and the Shibganj Upazila Freedom Fighters Complex.
