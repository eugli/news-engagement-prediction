The New York Times Reporter 8:59 PM ET \nYou have to recognize that Falcons are also out-coaching Patriots. On that last TD, Atlanta formation made it plain that Coleman was going to draw coverage from slow-footed LB Rob Ninkovich, who had no help. \nWith the football on left hash, that’s a mistake – too easy for Ryan to flare it out to Coleman who had more than half the field to out-run Ninkovich to the end zone. Victor Mather Reporter 9:01 PM ET \nA pass to White gets New England a first down. They’re going to have to be virtually mistake free to come back here. Third and short. Brady laterals to Edelman and he passes! Lewis gets a hand on it, but can’t pull it in. Pats go for it on 4th and 3 … and they make it! Amendola with the catch. They’re still alive. Andrew Das Editor 9:02 PM ET \nEven with a former college quarterback (Edelman) to throw it, that trick play had the whiff of panic. As if nothing else is working, so what the heck? Like so many passes by New England, though, the throw was not nearly good enough. Victor Mather Reporter 9:03 PM ET \nA pass gains nothing, then a bad incompletion. Brady runs on 3rd-and-8 and gets the first down. Pats are down to the 20. Bill Pennington Reporter 9:03 PM ET \nIf Brady is the team’s most effective running back – any team – you’ve got problems Andrew Das Editor 9:04 PM ET \nStill, the Patriots seem to be snacking on yards. At 28-3, they need some much bigger bites.
