The project will also nearly double the North Adams institution’s gallery space, provide studios for art fabrication, amenities for music festival guests, and support facilities for performing artists, among other things.\nAdvertisement\n“If most museums are boxes for static display, MASS MoCA has always aspired to be more like a turntable,” Thompson said in a statement. “At its heart, the expansion deepens our commitment to the interplay of visual and performing arts at a time when they are increasingly intertwined, fluid, and mutually reinforcing.”\nThe main feature of Building 6 will be its blend of long-term installations, changing exhibitions, and collaborations with artists such as James Turrell, Jenny Holzer, and Anderson, as well as the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation, the estate of Gunnar Schonbeck, and the Louise Bourgeois Trust.\nGet The Weekender in your inbox: The Globe's top picks for what to see and do each weekend, in Boston and beyond. Designed by Cambridge-based architects Bruner/Cott & Associates (who also designed the first two phases of museum renovations as well as the Sol LeWitt building), the renovation is part of the museum’s ongoing transformation of its 28-building, 16-acre campus. The current phase also calls for a bike path to wind through the Mass MoCA campus — including a tunnel that crosses Building 6 — which will connect to a network of area trails around Mount Greylock.\n“The way in which our radically changed circulation path will expose our audiences to the entire campus network of interior courtyards, performing arts fields, elevated walkways, and lightwells increases the experience of our facilities by an order of magnitude,” said Thompson.\nMalcolm Gay can be reached at malcolm.gay@globe.com .
