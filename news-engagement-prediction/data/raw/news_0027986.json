Psychologist shortage \nA spokesman said: \"Scotland's councils take the health and well-being of the children in our schools very seriously indeed. \n\"Councils employ educational psychologists and these officers are shared across the local authority area - focusing primarily on the children who need them, wherever they are based. Image copyright Science Photo Library \n\"We have a shortage of educational psychologists in Scotland at the present time and we are working jointly with the Scottish government to consider solutions to the issue. \n\"The mental health of our young people is a priority for Cosla and we know that it takes a range of professional officers to support our young people.\" \nA fifth of children referred to NHS Scotland's mental health counselling service, Camhs, are not seen within an 18-week target. 'Not acceptable' \nNHS figures show that between January 2015 and September 2016, a total of 30,639 children were seen by Camhs, with 6,745 patients seen after waiting more than 18 weeks. \nDuring the same period, 708 had to wait more than 53 weeks to be seen. \nMental Health Minister Maureen Watt said it was up to every local authority to decide how to provide mental health services in each school, but admitted it was a \"postcode lottery\". \nShe told BBC Scotland: \"I have said that where there are long waiting times in health boards for Cahms and psychological therapies, it's not acceptable. \n\"I have used part of the Â£150m to make sure that those health boards that are far away from meeting targets are given help to, where necessary, redesign their whole service and where they need more people, more psychologists more nurses that those are provided.\" \nShe added: \"We are beginning to see some improvement in some of the boards that we're already working with, but in some boards there is a long way to go.\" Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:43:07.973+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
