Close Williams ‘too sick’ for community service UP NEXT VIDEO Williams ‘too sick’ for community service \nRoberta Williams appeared before Melbourne Magistrates' Court on Thursday charged with breaching a community corrections order she received for offences that pre-date 2010. \nWilliams has pleaded guilty to the breach and her lawyer, Emma Turnbull, said her client was too ill to complete the terms of the order. \n\"She's been in and out of hospital,\" she told Magistrate Johanna Metcalf. \nMs Turnbull then asked the magistrate to close the court to protect the \"intimate details\" of Williams' health, who went into the witness box to explain her health issues. \nMs Turnbull said she had not expected Williams to appear in court on Thursday, but her client felt well enough to attend, although Williams coughed repeatedly as her lawyer addressed the court.

Roberta was the former wife of Carl Williams during the height of Melbourne's gangland war in the 2000s. \nRoberta was married to Carl at the height of Melbourne's gangland war in the 2000s and the couple have a daughter together. \nShe is reportedly embroiled in a feud with her former father-in-law's widow over her daughter Dhakota's inheritance from her grandfather's estate. \nMs Turnbull said she and Williams were also served with bankruptcy files on Thursday while waiting to appear in court. \nThe Australian Taxation Office started bankruptcy proceedings against Williams in the Federal Court in 2016.
