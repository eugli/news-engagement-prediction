Photo assistant: Lloyd Stevie The New Age of Traditional Mexican Mole The country’s top chefs are reinventing the complex sauce — 10, 20, even 30 ingredients at a time. Continue reading the main story The word “mole” doesn’t translate into “infinity,” but it feels like it should. The blurring, interlocking, continent-hopping ingredients reflect all of the cultures that have collided to form what Mexico is: the indigenous people who occupied the land first, the European invaders who forced their way in, immigrants from the Middle East and Asia. Often carelessly reduced to simply a sauce, “mole” is, in fact, a word used to unite a complex congregation of sauces — so many varieties with so many ingredients in so many household interpretations across Mexico, that it’s hard to know how to count them all. “In the kitchen, there is no recipe,” says Edgar Nuñez, the chef at Sud 777 in Mexico City. “It’s more a heart thing than theoretical.” Studying mole is like studying the universe: The quest goes on and on.

An hour south of that exquisite colonial city is the town of Zimatlán de Álvarez, where you’ll find a high priestess of the dish, Juana Amaya Hernandez. There are seven moles at the heart of Oaxacan traditions — in shades of yellow, green, red and black — and when I visited her restaurant, Mi Tierra Linda, Hernandez seemed determined to introduce me to as many as possible. Fires were lit with crackling tree branches. Sauces, their Rothko-ish hues shifting as the process inched along, bubbled in simmering pots. Banquet tables overflowed with chiles, seeds, nuts and fruit. The black mole, negro, I remember most vividly. Chiles were placed on the comal , the circular tortilla griddle, and left there until they were reduced to ash, essentially, and then folded into the base. The result was almost goth. Imagine eating flakes of night. Traditional preparations can make this ancestral sauce seem like an inviolable tradition. But young chefs — in Mexico as well as in New York, Los Angeles and Copenhagen — are demonstrating that, like pesto in Italy and curry in India, mole is about the beautiful alchemy that occurs when ordinary ingredients produce a taste that is sui generis. Indeed, these chefs argue that tweaking the old recipes only makes mole stronger. “That’s the beauty — it can be endless possibilities,” says Jorge Vallejo, the chef at the acclaimed Quintonil in Mexico City. “And it’s still evolving.’ ” Photo From left: Jorge Vallejo’s chilacayotes in homemade mole at Quintonil and Enrique Olvera’s mole madre and mole nuevo at Pujol, both in Mexico City. Credit Quintonil; Araceli Paz Vallejo strives to produce moles that are “super-refined” and “completely the opposite of how many people think of it.” Like many of his contemporaries, he wants to banish the notion that it has to be heavy, dark and gluey. If you’ve been served the dish in some Mexican restaurants — both here and in Mexico, the popular mole poblano is sometimes stirred up by adding water to a premade powder — then you probably know what he means. A true mole requires hours of preparation and close attention. Fallacies abound, the most common being that it is a sauce made of chocolate, an ingredient that appears only occasionally, as in the semisweet poblano. Mexico being Mexico, a mole nearly always includes chiles. And preparation is consistent: Multiple ingredients are ground up and a liquid, like stock, is added. There’s generally an aromatic (like garlic or onions) and a thickener (nuts, seeds, bread, tortillas). But, really, there are no absolutes, allowing chefs a wide range in which to freestyle. At the restaurant Alcalde in Guadalajara, Francisco Ruano knows that when a chef creates a mole in Mexico, he or she is announcing a declaration of principles. “When you want to make a statement on your menu, you make a mole,” he says. His own proclamation involves taking the dish’s “kind of baroque” infrastructure and giving it a more minimalist makeover. Eschewing the epic shopping list of ingredients required by some recipes, he views it as a challenge to produce the same deep, pronounced flavor with just 10 or 12. Ruano amps up the rivulets of sweetness and tartness with vinegar, charred bananas and onion purée; in one mole, he’s even brought umami to the equation with a base of seaweed. “That’s my way of cooking,” he says. “It’s not better and it’s not more sophisticated than the tradition. I just like to twist things.” His vibrantly green and velvety version of pipian (generally made from pumpkin seeds) doesn’t meet with much resistance from his customers — not unless we’re talking about his abuela, the woman from whom Ruano learned about pipian. “She tried it and said, ‘What the hell did you do?’ ” he recalls. “Grandmothers...” Photo Francisco Ruano’s piglet with seaweed mole at Alcalde in Guadalajara. Credit Pedro Andrés When it comes to trailblazing, nobody has received more attention than Enrique Olvera, the chef behind Pujol in Mexico City and Cosme in New York City. True to its moniker, his “mole madre” at Pujol aspires to be a kind of earth mother of all moles: He and his team keep feeding it, aging it, letting it funkily expand and evolve from month to month. (Last summer, food blogs celebrated the moment when it crossed the 1,000-days mark. It’s still going.) “Really,” muses Daniela Soto-Innes, the James Beard Award-winning chef who runs Cosme’s kitchen, “mole is about patience.” And it has always, she adds, offered a blank canvas for experimentation and innovation. Her grandmother used to make a version with peanuts and dried shrimp — a combination that sounds more Vietnamese than Mexican — and serve it over rice: “It was the most delicious thing,” she says. More traditionally, there’s a wedding mole, made only for the couple getting married, that is all white and suffused with pale ingredients like pistachios, chicken, golden raisins and white chocolate. In another colonial city, Puebla (ancestral home of poblano), the chef Angel Vazquez has done his share of bridge building — echoes of Thailand, Greece and Morocco have been evident in his cooking. But at his new place, Augurio, he has decided to hunker down with tradition. The restaurant is devoted to mole in its purest form; when diners sit down, they start by selecting which variety they’re in the mood for, with the course of the meal unfolding from there. “We’re giving more importance to the sauce,” Vazquez says. For connoisseurs, everything depends on the moment when mole makes contact with a warm tortilla. And while chefs may be finding new ways for you to experience that moment, Vazquez, for his part, is obsessed with the old ways.
