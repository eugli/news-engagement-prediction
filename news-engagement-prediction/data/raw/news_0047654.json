[], "text": "Valentine's Day came a little late for Jocelyn Wildenstein, as the Swiss-born socialite whose plastic surgeries have earned her the nickname Catwoman enjoyed a romantic dinner with designer Lloyd Klein on Wednesday night just hours after being cleared of assaulting him.\nThe duo rekindled their romance at Le Cirque in New York City where they celebrated Klein's 50th birthday with a swanky soiree, organized by Wildenstein, that was capped off with a 24 carat gold birthday cake, which the invite stated would be 'besieged by a scandal of panthers'.\nHours earlier Wildenstein learned she would not be charged with assault in the second degree and inflicting injuries with a weapon after she allegedly clawed at Klein's face, slashed him with a pair of scissors and poured hot wax on him at her Trump World Tower Apartment.\nAnd as an extra gift at the birthday bash, Wildenstein wrapped herself up tight in a shimmery blue leather dress for Klein, which she paired with sky-high Chanel heels, a large Chanel handbag and a mid-length leather jacket that was trimmed with fur to give the look a bit of texture.\nScroll down for video\nReunited and it feels so good: Jocelyn Wildenstein (above on Wednesday night) has rekindled her romance with Lloyd Klein\nThe look of love: On Wednesday night Wildenstein (above) showed up to Le Cirque in New York City for the

76-year-old divorcee made a quick exit from Manhattan Criminal Court on Wednesday after getting the good news about the assault charges.\nShe then rushed home to change out of her daytime legal look of suede knee-high boots, leather leggings, a mink bomber jacket and fedora to her more refined evening outfit.\nThat second look, like almost all of Wildenstein's sartorial choices, included only leather and fur pieces with the exception of her black stockings.\nWildenstein declined to comment on the dust-up as she climbed into her limo outside the courtroom o Wednesday.\nDailyMail.com revealed on Wednesday that Klein declined to press charges against Wildenstein and has remained on good terms with his high-profile ex despite their public rift.\nThe Canadian-born couturier was able to celebrate getting through the two-month ordeal at his lavish birthday dinner, where chefs prepared a personalized menu that started with snails and then moved on to a truffle souffle before ending with roasted pigeon.\nKlein, who has designed clothes for Nicki Minaj, Pink and Joan Collins, was also hauled into custody days after the December 6 fight for supposedly pushing Wildenstein over when he returned for his possessions.\nHowever he was cleared of any wrongdoing at a court hearing earlier this month. 'I'm really happy for her,’ he said today in an exclusive interview with DailyMail.com. ‘The whole thing was a misunderstanding and she never meant to do me any harm.\n‘Despite her ferocious relation she's actually a very kind and gentle woman. 'I don't know what’s going to happen in the future but we will celebrate my birthday in style and take it from there.'\nPigeins for dinner: DailyMail.com was the first to reveal that the Canadian-born couturier would be celebruating his bog dat at Le Cirque\nCourtroom couple: Klein's (pictured in court with scars allegedly from Wildenstein) hearing lasted under a minute on Monday and saw the judge dismiss all charges against him due to a lack of evidence. Wildenstein did not accompany Klein to court\nThe 'bride of Wildenstein' was once one of the wealthiest women in the United States after securing an estimated $2.5billion divorce payment and $100million a year in maintenance.\nIn a recent interview however she claimed that the Wildenstein family trust that had been making monthly payments of $111,000 to her had dried up in March 2015, leaving her with no income.\n'I wasn’t ready for it. How can I pay for dental care, doctors, the expenses of my homes or travelling? I have nothing to pay with,' she said. 'You know, it cannot be, that one day - all of the sudden - they stop the payments... Just leaving me like that... They expected me to live only 20 years.’\nWildenstein has never commented on the December bust-up with Klein, during which he was forced to push her into a closet to escape her rage he later told police.\nTumble and a fall: Going...The heiress reaches out help stop herself from hitting the ground\nSwank digs: Wildenstein put her $13million New York condo for sale following the brawl. Pictured, Klein relaxing in the lavish apartment\nThrowback: Klein and Wildenstein are seen in this September 2013 in Los Angeles, California\nDailyMail.com revealed though that it was the socialite herself who called the police when she could not figure out how to turn the door handle to let herself out of the walk-in closet.\nOfficers who arrived on the scene took one look at Klein's blooded face and chest and took Wildenstein into custody.\nKlein, whose brother is the world-renowned artist Jean-Yves Klein, was said to have burst into Wildenstein's bedroom during 'round two' of their explosive conflict when he returned for his possessions.\nHowever he ridiculed the accusations as a tit-for-tat attempt to discredit him and was cleared of any wrongdoing weeks later.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T16:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T10:43:53.604+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
