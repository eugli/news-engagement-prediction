These traits created a strong foundation for me as a student and were later incredibly valuable as I set out in my professional career. Dancing inspired me with a lifelong appreciation for the arts, and I continue to have the greatest admiration for the beauty of dancers who exhibit both strength and grace.” \n  her book, “The Trump Card: Playing to Win in Work and Life,” published by Touchstone in 2009 when Ms. Trump was just 27, she conveys a respect for the ballet school and a reverence for “The Nutcracker” that she once feared might be jeopardized by the attendance of Michael Jackson, who then lived one floor below her in Trump Tower: Once, when I was around 8, I was fortunate enough to be admitted to the School of American Ballet, based in Lincoln Center. It was considered a great accomplishment to be accepted into this program, but I sometimes wonder if my application was helped along by my last name. Maybe, maybe not. I was good but not great. Focused, but not as single-minded as some of my tutu-wearing peers. And quite possibly too tall to make it as a ballerina. In any case, we were very young and extremely full of our little dancer selves. Such prima donnas! And it wasn’t just the kids who took the program seriously. The instructors and choreographers approached each session as if the very future of American ballet rested on our performances. The highlight of our season was a performance of “The Nutcracker.” We rehearsed for months and months. Jackson, as it turns out, was inspired by Tchaikovsky. “If you take an album like ‘Nutcracker Suite ,’ every song is a killer, every one,” he told MTV News in 2007. “So I said to myself, ‘Why can’t there be a pop album where every [song is a killer]?’” Mr. Trump arranged to get him a ticket to “The Nutcracker.” This made his daughter — and her fellow cast members — thrilled but also concerned. Somehow Michael heard about the looming ‘Nutcracker’ performance and expressed an interest in attending. It’s possible he was just being polite — but knowing Michael’s affinity for dance, I think it’s more likely that he was genuinely interested. So my father arranged to get him a ticket. When the day of the performance finally came around, it appeared that word had gotten out that Michael Jackson was planning to attend. That, too, was cool — until word got around that I had had something to do with it. Naturally, the kids were over-the-top excited. I was also excited, but less so as the performance approached. You see, one of the older dancers had the idea that we should each wear a single white glove on our left hand as we danced “The Nutcracker,” to honor Michael. Cute and harmless, right? But I didn’t see it that way, In fact, I was mortified. I was convinced that the sideshow would compromise the sanctity of “The Nutcracker” and that I would be singled out as the one to blame. As it happened, the instructors shared my concern. In fact, they were furious, and demanded to know who was responsible for undermining their otherwise estimable production. The teenage dancer and her friends who’d actually concocted the idea were too cowardly to fess up. All the grown-ups were running around backstage, frantic and crazy in their terribly important way, and I was certain that one of them would decide that I was the person responsible for the mess. For a short-lived moment I wished like hell that I had been born into some other set of circumstances — far away from the spotlight I couldn’t help but think was aimed at me, even when it wasn’t. Happily, no one thought to blame me. The anger fizzled. We danced our little butts off. “The Nutcracker” emerged unscathed. Life went on in our precious little corner of New York City. And now, looking back, it’s such a sweet, uniquely personal memory of such an iconic entertainer, even though at the time I tossed a whole lot of unnecessary adolescent angst into the mix. P.S. Michael loved the show. Ms. Trump has posted images and video highlighting Arabella ’s interest in dance and took her to see the ballet at the Mariinsky Theater on a visit to St. Petersburg. Which invites the question: Will she also give her two little boys the opportunity to try tights and dance? \nFollow Robin Pogrebin on Twitter @rpogrebin A version of this article appears in print on February 20, 2017, on Page C7 of the New York edition with the headline: Might a First Daughter Prove a Defender of the Arts?.
