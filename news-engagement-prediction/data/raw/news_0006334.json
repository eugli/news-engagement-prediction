He sat next to the 22-year-old McLean on the bus from Edmonton to Winnipeg after the young man smiled at him and asked how he was doing.\nBaker said he heard the voice of God telling him to kill the young carnival worker or \"die immediately.\"\nHe repeatedly stabbed McLean while the young man fought for his life. As passengers fled the bus, Baker continued stabbing and mutilating the body before he was arrested.\nHe was found to be not criminally responsible due to a mental illness — schizophrenia.\nBaker was originally kept in a secure wing at the Selkirk Mental Health Centre, but the board has granted him increasing freedoms almost every year.\nHis medical team has said he has been a model patient and understands the need to continue to take anti-psychotic medication.\nMP wants request denied At his last review board hearing, Baker was granted the right to live on his own, but subject to monitoring and random drug tests.\nThe Supreme Court of Canada ruled in 1999 that a review board must order an absolute discharge if a person doesn't pose a significant threat to public safety.\nThe ruling added there must be clear evidence of a significant risk to the public for the review board to continue imposing conditions after a person is found not criminally responsible.\nArchie Kaiser, an expert in mental health and the law at Dalhousie University in Halifax, said there's a poor public\nunderstanding of what \"not criminally responsible\" means. The emphasis must be on the individual's treatment and potential risk to the community, not on punishment.\n\"There is widespread stigma and prejudice when it concerns people with mental illness and that's something that persons found not criminally responsible bear in double measure,\" Kaiser said.\n\"People think if you have a serious mental-health problem that you're going to act unpredictably, that you're incapable of making decisions and you're dangerous, whereas none of those things are likely to be true.\"\nKaiser also suggested involvement with the justice system serves to amplify concerns about an individual, \"so people have at least two levels of prejudice that they're fighting against.\"\nManitoba Tory MP James Bezan said Baker's request for a discharge should be denied — and Bezan expects it will be.\n\"Will Baker, regardless of the name that he goes by, still beheaded and cannibalized Tim McLean,\" he said in an emailed statement.\nHe called an absolute discharge an insult to the victim's family and a risk to public safety.\n\"Tim McLean's family's rights and well-being should be at the forefront of the court's decision. The family has endured significant loss and suffering ... (and) to allow a murderer to be released without any conviction or conditions would simply be wrong.\"\n© The Canadian Press, 2017", "external_links": ["http://www.cp.org/"], "published": "2017-02-01T00:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T04:58:46.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
