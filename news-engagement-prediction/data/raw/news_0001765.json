The speedster revolutionized the way the position was played with his incredible running ability coupled with his outstanding arm.\nHowever, his career will always be swallowed with a good deal of controversy stemming from his dog fighting case, for which he was arrested and served time.\nHad that never have happened, Michael Vick may have had a very different career, and have been remembered in an entirely different way. But he might have unraveled in a different fashion otherwise.\nA polarizing man and a spectacular talent. Sad to see him retire ringless, for sure.\nFor more from this author, follow him on Twitter @NickyBeaster or like his Facebook Page\nFor our best sports content and jokes, follow @12up on Twitter.\nAnd for everything you missed, swing by our Facebook page!\nPHOTOS: SUPER BOWL WEEK\nSuper Bowl LI week\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100005756539266", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmBgSO.img&quot;}}", "https://t.co/0sN66Ggo52", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;DomainId&quot;:", "https://twitter.com/NickyBeaster", "https://twitter.com/12upSport", "http://c.120sportsstatic.com/gen/client/rss/ms_timeline.xml&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;externalPlayerName&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;120Sports&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;externalPlayerUri&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://secure.ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;QB", "http://www.12up.com/", "https://secure.ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:", "https://www.facebook.com/12UPsports/?fref=ts", "https://twitter.com/JosinaAnderson", "https://twitter.com/SportsCenter/status/827631206514774016"], "published": "2017-02-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T08:24:19.582+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
