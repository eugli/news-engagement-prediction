(Photo: AFP) Dubai : When he burst into the scene, Umar Akmal was termed as one of the most talented cricketers to ever play for Pakistan. However, despite being compared with Virat Kohli at times, Umar Akmal has failed to live up to the expectations.\nAkmal now has overtaken the likes of Herschelle Gibbs, Tillakaratne Dilshan, and Dwayne Smith, to hold the dubious record of having scored the most number of ducks in T20 cricket.\nThe 26-year-old, who is currently playing for the Lahore Qalandars, in the Pakistan Super League (PSL), topped the dubious list when he got out for nought against Peshawar Zalmi, in Dubai on Sunday.\nAkmal, who has now been dismissed for a duck 24 times, overtook Gibbs of South Africa, Dilshan of Sri Lanka and Smith of the West Indies – all of whom have 23 zero scores each, in the shortest format of the game.\nProteas legend Gibbs has played the fewest number of innings (167), when compared to the other three – Dilshan (217), Smith (270), and Akmal (204).\nThe player to head the list of most number of ducks amongst the Indians is Delhi opener Gautam Gambhir, who has been dismissed for nought 18 times in T20 cricket. Gambhir is followed by off-spinner Harbhajan Singh (17).\nJeetan Patel of New Zealand has the dubious record of being dismissed for nought most frequently in T20 cricket, as he has scored 17 ducks from 68 innings – which literally takes his chances of scoring a duck up to 25 per cent in the shortest format of the game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T21:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T11:44:48.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
