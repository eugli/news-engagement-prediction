When they reported the matter at Kasarani Police Station, officers on duty were reluctant to take their statement. \n“To our utter shock, when we went to report the matter at Kasarani Police Station, no officer was willing to help. I bet the self-confessed Kwekwe squad were still trailing us because while at the station trying to figure if we could have our statements taken, we were confronted by three thuggish young men (of around my age) who wanted to ascertain whether we had been beaten up by police officers and whether we had captured the car number plate,” the journalist recounted. \nThe journalist was treated at Nairobi Hospital and is recovering but still traumatised from the ordeal. The journalist said he is now fearing for his life since the assailants have his phone which has all his contacts. \nWe at Nairobi News wish them a quick recovery and hope the police will follow up the matter and arrest the culprits.
