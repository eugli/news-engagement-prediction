Army chief : Take it slowly \nDSI officials, with support from the police and the military, began the search operation on Feb 16 to locate Phra Dhammajayo after Prime Minister Prayut invoked Section 44 to declare Wat Phra Dhammakaya a restricted zone. \nThe authorities could not find the controversial monk amid reports that a lay follower identified as Alongkorn Sathapitanont, better known as Coke, helped him escape when the DSI launched the raid. \nAccording to the DSI, the authorities searched Mr Alongkorn's house Tuesday but did not find either Mr Alongkorn or the former abbot. ( Story continues below infographic ) \nGen Prayut said the temple would remain a restricted area until Phra Dhammajayo was arrested or turned himself in to fight embezzlement charges. \nHe said the National Office of Buddhism (NOB) and the SSC had previously joined efforts to make the Pathum Thani temple more accessible to the public. \n\"Section 44 will not be revoked because [the search for the former abbot] isn't over. The temple remains a restricted area until Phra Dhammajayo turns himself in and the temple management is restructured,\" he said. \nHe also shrugged off criticism the government wanted to seize gold Buddha statues in the temple, amid claims they were funded with embezzled money, saying he doubted they were made of real gold. \nNOB director Phanom Sornsilp said the SSC was concerned about the situation at Wat Phra Dhammakaya and Phra Phrommunee, secretary to His Holiness Supreme Patriarch, has asked monastic committees governing the temple to meet and resolve the issue. \nHe said the meeting will be chaired by Somdet Phra Buddha Chinnawong, the abbot of Wat Pichaya Yatikaram and chief of the monastic committee in the Central region, with representatives from the Justice Ministry. \nHe said the monastic circle will work with state authorities in solving the issue but noted the Supreme Patriarch has given no instructions involving Wat Phra Dhammakaya's situation. \nMr Phanom said all monastic committees have been advised to tell monks that Wat Phra Dhammakaya is a restricted area and entering it is illegal. \nNational police chief Chakthip Chaichinda said he ordered Police Region 2 and Police Region 7 to deploy more police around the temple to step up security.
