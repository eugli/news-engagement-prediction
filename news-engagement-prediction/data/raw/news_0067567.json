I asked if we could do a bit of defending and we did it once before we played Southampton. We lost and we didn’t do it again.”\nAnyone who has seen Manchester City this season, and particularly those of a certain age who tuned in to watch Wednesday’s 5-3 victory over Monaco in a wonderfully chaotic first leg of their Champions League Round of 16 tie , might detect a whiff of Keegan’s Entertainers about Pep Guardiola’s schizophrenic side.\nLike Keegan, Guardiola will not sacrifice creativity for the sake of defensive solidity. Like Newcastle, City’s defensive shortcomings can be both masked and, at the same time, brutally exposed by an all-out attack and its unquenchable thirst for goals .\nGuardiola has long subscribed to the belief that attack is the best form of defence. Yet given the imbalance between the quality of players he has to work with at the two ends of the pitch, an imbalance for which he must take some responsibility, the City manager seems to be banking between now and the end of the season on his vibrant attacking arsenal bailing out a back line that is as sturdy as a wet paper bag.\nCity's defence was again below par on Tuesday night Credit: Reuters “We are a team that can score goals but we can also concede goals,” Yaya Toure, the City midfielder, said.\n“When we were winning 4-3 [against Monaco] we continued to attack. With the new manager now it’s all about attack. Sometimes you can make a mistake but mistakes are part of the game. If you don’t make mistakes, the football is not going to follow.”\nL eroy Sane has been electrifying for the past two months, underlining his status as one of Europe’s most exciting young talents, Raheem Sterling has raised his game, David Silva has looked largely unplayable of late and few players have the delivery to rival Kevin De Bruyne.\nThe one frustration is that Gabriel Jesus’s stupendous start at City lasted just 293 minutes before he succumbed to a metatarsal injury that could have ended his season but the upside of the teenage Brazilian’s emergence is that it may have helped to reinvigorate Sergio Aguero. That slick fluidity upfront was never better encapsulated than for the fifth goal against Monaco.\nMan City 5 - 3 Monaco (Leroy Sané, 82 min) “We have the spring upfront, we have fantastic players,” Toure said. “Sane and Sterling were massive. You saw Aguero tracking back, going forward, scoring two important goals, setting up Sane for the fifth. After the game, my wife called me and said we were looking so young.”\nT he question, of course, is how much damage a brittle defence does to the team’s aspirations over the final three months of the campaign. Guardiola may have talked about the difficulties of containing a Monaco attack that also break at such speed and in large numbers but the reality is that the French club’s first goal originated from a mistake by goalkeeper Willy Caballero and the second and third from long balls that the hapless centre-half pairing of Nicolas Otamendi and John Stones failed to deal with.\nThere is a reason Guardiola insisted he will again put the accent on attack for the second leg. He has little faith in his team keeping a clean sheet.\nWatch | Manchester City vs Monaco - key match stats 01:02 C ity had actually conceded just once in their previous five matches before Monaco but will Wednesday’s defensive meltdown signal the start of more fluctuating fortunes in defence? It has been that way all season - relative periods of calm before the dam bursts again and they ship goals in large bundles.\nBacary Sagna, the right back, touched upon one of the problems. “I think we have to communicate a bit more,” he said.\nThat lack of communication was particularly evident for Monaco’s second goal when Stones allowed Kylian Mbappe to run across him because Otamendi was oblivious to the danger. But it is down to more than just communication. Stones is not aggressive enough, as proven by the ease with which Radamel Falcao bundled him out of the way in the lead up to scoring his exquisite lob .\nWhere does Manchester City 5 Monaco 3 rank in the 10 most exciting Champions League games involving O tamendi’s habitually lazy positional play, which resulted in him conceding a penalty and failing to get back in time to cover Stones for Monaco’s third goal, makes him a frequent liability. Guardiola’s failure to sign two new full-backs last summer and the haste with which he jettisoned goalkeeper Joe Hart merely compounded the problems. Caballero may be a better bet than Claudio Bravo but he is an enforced stop-gap, not a long-term solution.\nAttack first, defend later. It could be the way of things for the remainder of the season at City.\nCaballero to wait until summer to decide on future Caballero could be offered a new contract at Manchester City but he is likely to wait to see how the goalkeeping situation develops over the remainder of the season with Pep Guardiola expected to bring in a new No. 1 this summer.\nFew consider Caballero the long term solution to City's problems in goal Credit: Rex Features C aballero is out of contract at the end of the season, but despite dislodging Claudio Bravo as Guardiola’s first choice goalkeeper in the past month, the Argentine is reluctant to return to being an understudy and will not rush a decision on his future.\nCity are looking for long-term replacements for Joe Hart, with Ederson Moraes, of Benfica, one name in the frame, after appearing to accept that their gamble on Bravo has backfired. The Chilean was signed from Barcelona for £13.75 million last August as a replacement for Joe Hart, who was sent on loan to Torino and has no future under Guardiola, but the 33-year-old has struggled to adapt to English football and is not certain to remain at the club beyond the summer.\nMan City Monaco timeline", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:19:10.652+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
