But the puppet springs into action in time for the second verse. Later, a light rain starts to fall on Chance, who slowly gets up and walks off the set. As the camera follows him, it reveals that the whole film set is manned entirely by puppets. \n\"Same Drugs\" appeared last year on Chance's Coloring Book mixtape. The tape is nominated for Best Rap Album at the upcoming Grammys. That's one of several nominations Chance received: he's also competing in the categories for Best New Artist, Best Rap Performance, Best Rap Song and Best Rap/Sung Performance.
