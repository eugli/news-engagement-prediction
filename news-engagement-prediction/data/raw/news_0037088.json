It’s The Winter’s Tale, week one of rehearsals – jeans and T-shirts all round – but Kinnear is delivering an intense stream of consciousness while acting out what King Leontes might experience the moment he realises the daughter he thought he had killed as an infant is now standing before him as a woman. “When you’re guilty and someone is nice to you, how good does that feel,” he murmurs. “And now I’m clocking her face, her hand, and now there’s this incredibly slow sensation of, oh wow, what the fuck.” \nKinnear is a greatly respected British actor, born into a theatre family and acclaimed for intelligent portrayals of Hamlet and Iago at the National Theatre as well as his marvellously dependable and subtly wry Bill Tanner in recent Bond films . The difference here is that he’s directing, not acting, and this is opera, not theatre. Kinnear makes his directorial debut at English National Opera this month with a new setting of The Winter’s Tale by composer/conductor Ryan Wigglesworth .

He arrives wearing a tatty sports rucksack and beanie. “I told Ryan no because a) there are people who know how to do that really well; b) there are some pretty major shadows when it comes to making Shakespeare into opera. And c) well, Ryan needed to think it through for himself.” After a couple of years, Wigglesworth did come up with his own libretto and asked Kinnear to direct it. “Again I said I wasn’t qualified! But I asked [director] Richard Jones for advice and he told me: ‘You’ve seen plenty of directors work, it’s not rocket science.’ So I agreed. If it’s a disaster, I apologise to everyone.” \nWhat has made the process non-disastrous so far, according to Kinnear, is Wigglesworth’s score. “I’m not having to unlock the beats within the play, the moments where the temperature in a scene changes. That’s all been done for me with fine dramatic sensibility. In the end I’ve not been overawed by the task.” Kinnear (centre) as Macheath in The Threepenny Opera at the National Theatre, London. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian \nKey here is that Kinnear has the musical sensibility to recognise what Wigglesworth’s music is doing. Last year he braved a singing role of his own, playing Macheath in Brecht/Weill’s Threepenny Opera , but music goes back further and deeper. At primary school he was allocated a trumpet – “a four-year-old wielding a trumpet wouldn’t be everyone’s idea of good news,” he winces, “but my dad seemed to like it. I remember trying to learn the Dambusters theme tune and him throwing open the doors saying, ‘Let’s really piss off the neighbours.’” \nHis father, Roy Kinnear, died when Rory was 10 . He had a heart attack after being thrown from a horse while filming The Return of the Musketeers. “Music suddenly became a big deal,” Kinnear says. “Suffering grief at that age, and something about classical music gets right deep and down, and I guess I fast-tracked the deep and dark side of my soul through what happened.” He started playing the piano, which he calls his “grief balm”, and he listened a lot. “Maybe it tells you which stage of grief I was at, but I heard the Dies Irae of Mozart’s Requiem and I thought: ‘Yup, there’s the tumult.’” \nHe sang, too, and considered applying for an Oxbridge choral scholarship. (He has said in previous interviews that he was “put off by the people”, but sheepishly revises that now: “I’m aware I’m working with singers!”). Acting won out after he played Cyrano de Bergerac when he was 15 and realised he had the capacity to move people. “Acting was pretty much a question of showing off, until I went to drama school. But part of drama school was considering what acting actually means – the reasoning and rigour. Then you go back to instinct and imagination.” Kinnear (left) with Iain Paterson and Anthony Gregory in rehearsals for Wigglesworth’s Winter’s Tale at ENO. Photograph: Johan Persson \nAs a director he seems to embrace all that. In rehearsal he morphs into Iain Paterson ’s Leontes, Susan Bickley ’s Paulina, Samantha Price ’s Perdita, pacing and shaping the scene by becoming each character in turn. It’s one of his favourite Shakespeares – “a divided play,” he calls it, “a play of two halves with this great gulf of time and geography. It’s odd there haven’t been major operatic treatments until now because it lends itself perfectly. How does Bohemia sound compared to Sicily? The sense of magic, the sense of holding out for the transcendent … Shouldn’t all that be catnip to a composer? That sense of building towards something massive and profound?” \nAbsolutely, though I suspect there won’t be any blatantly ecstatic Tristan and Isolde-style moments of apotheosis in this version. Wigglesworth’s music is typically lean, exacting and supple; there is a lot of space and delicacy. “That’s exactly what I like about Ryan’s work,” Kinnear says. “It withholds. It refrains. It’s not modish. That’s what I find the most affecting – when you’re able to hear through the cracks rather than feel the torrent.” \nKinnear ponders aloud what it means to be staging this particular opera for this particular company – the production is part of ENO’s significantly reduced 2016-17 season – in the context of current global politics. “It hasn’t escaped us that the piece is about regeneration,” he says. “About how we still hold on to each other despite fractures, how good things can coalesce around those fractures. And yes, we’re doing a piece about an authoritarian, borderline-tyrannical leader who is appalling in his treatment of women, ignorant of nature, and quick to create borders between a neighbouring country. A guy wrote the play 400 years ago and we’ve been planning our version for four years. The timing of premiering it in February 2017 is slightly discomforting. Talk about opera being relevant.” \n• The Winter’s Tale is at the Coliseum, London, from 27 February until 14 March.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T10:28:54.999+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
