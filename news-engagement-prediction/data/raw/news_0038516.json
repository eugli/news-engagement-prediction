At the lodging house, they cut off Muhammad’s legs and packed his torso and legs, wrapped in trash bags, in two suitcases. \nThey cleaned up the murder scene with soap, before dragging the suitcases out of the house to dispose of the body. \nThey left the suitcase containing Muhammad’s legs at Jalan Kubor Muslim cemetery, and abandoned the other, containing the dead man’s torso, along Syed Alwi Road after its wheels broke and blood began to seep out of the suitcase. \nThe bloody suitcase was found hours later by an elderly man, who struggled to move the suitcase and sought help from passers-by, before they realised the suitcase contained a dismembered body. They called the police. \nRasheed and Ramzan were arrested the next day, and Rasheed led police to the cemetery to recover Muhammad’s legs. \nTheir movements the day before had been captured on by CCTVs, which showed the men at Mustafa Centre and later, dragging two suitcases along Rowell Road. \nAt trial, the men – who are distant relatives – blamed each other for Muhammad’s death. “What really happened in Muhammad Noor’s room (at the lodging house) no one may know for certain,\" High Court Justice Choo Han Teck said. “Except that (he) was killed by either Rasheed or Ramzan, with the other assisting in the homicide.” \nWhile the men did not deny they were in Muhammad’s room the night he was killed, both gave inconsistent and conflicting evidence about who did what. But based on the evidence, Justice Choo found it was Ramzan who smothered Muhammad, while Rasheed strangled him with his hands and a cloth string. \nFurther evidence of the men’s intent to commit murder was that “one man alone could not have carried out the dismemberment of Muhammad’s body”, Justice Choo said. \nRasheed, 46, is married with eight children, and came to Singapore to work to earn money for his daughters’ dowry. Ramzan, 28, is also married with three children. They came to Singapore in May 2014 and sold packets of tissue paper on the streets to make a living. - CNA/kk", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T12:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T08:02:57.949+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
