No serious flooding — such as the deluge along the Russian River in Guerneville in early January — is expected. \nA second, and less-defined, storm system could follow the first one early next week, with preliminary rainfall forecasts of 1-3 inches through Monday for that storm, forecasters said.\nMichael Bodley is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
