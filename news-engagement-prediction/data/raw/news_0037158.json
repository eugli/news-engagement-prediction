This album has meant a lot to me and I wanted it to sound as mind-blowing as possible. ... Because of this, I wasn’t settling for a mix or recording that I wasn’t completely obsessed with. This is when Bob Hoag came into the picture and revealed a whole new world of recording to me, making me fall in love with it all over again. We recorded for a consecutive five days with Bob at Flying Blanket, and I’m so proud of what we created in the studio in those five sessions. Bob is truly a genius, and we all vibed really well together, so being able to bounce off ideas and try new things in that type of environment really helped to make the album what it is.”\nUpsahl   (Photo: Sundawg) \nThey happened to be working on the album on election day. And as Upsahl says, \"Obviously, the political climate at that time was highly intense, so we would occasionally take breaks to talk politics or watch the live streams of votes coming in. Whether or not we were pleased with the turnout of the election, we always joke about how we basically got through it together. Which I think also speaks to the power of music in general: We were able to take a rough situation and lighten it up with recording music. You’ll notice that the song 'Good News For Bad People' on the album is about politics in general, so the relevance of that song really kicked in while we were in the studio.\"\nMORE: Local music picks for February \nThe title of the album came from a lyric in “Digital Papers,” the opening track: “The windows are closing in. Unfamiliar light is not welcome.”\nAs Upsahl explains it, “ ‘Digital Papers’ is about the lack of originality that popular media allows us to have. The concept of ‘unfamiliar light,’ to me, is our creativity, our ability to challenge opinions, and our communication with one another to generate positive change, so in saying that it’s ‘not welcome,’ it’s a diss on societal expectations that influence people to feel that they should act a certain way. I named my album after this lyric because the album in general is a clear social commentary.”\nShe wrote the song according to a visual she had in mind.\n\"The video that I had literally been directing in my mind aligned really well with the choppy rhythms and dynamics of the song,\" Upsahl says, \"so I wrote lyrics that followed this vibe of 'unison, syncopation, and unoriginality.' Since I wanted a music video for this song, I knew that the recording had to be killer enough to be a single, so I spent a lot of time on this song specifically. I have about four different recorded versions of it. Once we finished recording, I got to co-produce the music video, and my ideas were finally coming to life. We had about 30 of my friends dressed in all black and white in a warehouse, doing cool movements, my best friend choreographed a part of the video, and it overall turned out better than I could have imagined. It just goes to show that hard work really does pay off when it comes to writing, recording, and producing music!\"\nThe video, directed by one of the Valley's finest, Matty Steinkamp, was released this month and featured in our playlist of Songs you need to heard right now , so hopefully, you took us up on that because it is a great song.\nUpsahl graduates this spring from Arizona School for Arts and plans to spend the next year focused solely on her musical career.\n\"I’ve already started working on some new stuff that I’ll be recording either this spring or following my summer tour,\" she says. \"Essentially, I am spending this next year as a full-time musician, so we’ll see where we can go from there. I have very positive feelings towards the future right now. I feel like if you expect great things, great things will happen, so I’m really putting a lot of positive energy into my music currently.\"\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 25. Valley Bar, 130 N.

And as long as we had his attention, we took the opportunity to ask a few questions about the making of the album and how getting into standup comedy (as Bryan Preston) helped contribute to the vibe of this one.\nWe also talked about TVLiFE Entertainment, the Tempe record label Preston runs. Here's what he had to say.\nQuestion: So, what was your goal going into the making of “RADICAL”? And how would you say that compares to the approach of “Infernal”? \nAnswer: I grew up listening to Wu-Tang, Eminem, Lil’ Kim and Missy Elliott, so a lot of the previous stuff I released had this degree of shock and performance art to it. I knew I’d never be the best rapper, but I always wanted to have the most fun doing it. After a while, I came to terms with the fact that weirding people out and shocking them was easy. Writing something that was more inclusive or made people feel good was harder and that became my motivation. It’s always been my goal to make something that both your grandmother and niece would equally enjoy.\nMORE MUSIC: Crescent Ballroom owner Charlie Levy to open 1,800-capacity music club the Van Buren in mid-2017 | 15 songs you need to hear right now: Phoenix Afrobeat Orchestra, Ray Davies | Best music videos by Phoenix artists in 2016: Captain Squeegee, Injury Reserve \nQ: You took a break from hip-hop to focus on comedy after touring on “Infernal.” What got you into comedy? \nA: People have been telling me that I should do standup my whole life, but I never really listened to them. I’ve always liked making people laugh because of how good a real laugh can feel deep down inside. It can be extremely therapeutic and that has always fascinated me. That ability to take pain and turn it into pleasure (even if it’s for someone else’s pleasure) can be as healing as, if not more than, music, and I needed that when I lost my cousin Jorel back in 2015. Comedy became the light in all that darkness.\nAZCENTRAL\nThings To Do app: Get the best in events, dining and travel right on your device\nQ: What impact do you think your comedy had on the making of “RADICAL?” \nA: I got to this point where I began writing jokes more than I was writing lyrics for songs and that naturally spilled into the music. I began to think of the album as a platform to sell people on my legitimacy as possibly the best rapper you heard of but never actually heard. From the opening track, you definitely get an introduction for any new listeners but it’s all based in this fictional and very tongue-in-cheek talk show where the host is listing real accomplishments I’d achieved to tie in the whole art imitating life thing we do. Throw in a skit or two where I make fun of myself, and the project really evened out into something that had the skeleton of my old material wrapped in this new perspective I had acquired about life.\n(Caution: Video contains NSFW language.) \nQ: You worked pretty closely with Scott Mitting on this album. How did you hook up with him? \nA: I had the hardest time finding someone to help me master this album for what seemed like forever. It got to the point where I really just gave up on it. One day, Andy Warpigs asked me to be in this noise band (Militia Joan Hart) with him and that project always drew this same guy to our shows. I was being really paranoid about him and I asked Andy if he knew who the hell this guy was and he says to me, “Oh, that’s Scott. He makes music and is pretty good at mastering albums.” I eventually made this joke where I said something to him like, “If you come to four of our shows in a row then you’re in the band” and he did. One night, I reached out to him to see if he could master this song I had called “Do It” that I was shooting a video for. After a few interactions of sending files back and forth, he sends me my song back and by the end of hearing that final mix I knew he would be the only one who could help me make the album I always wanted to make.\nQ: What do you feel like he brought to the table? \nA: Scott has this energy that I had never experienced from anyone before working with him. His attention to detail and knowledge of sound is something that take years to achieve. The man has probably purchased and tested tons of hardware and software, so he knows what’s necessary and what’s just a fad when it comes to producing music. I look forward to everything he works on in the future. I’m eternally grateful to have such a devoted friend who has a lust for sound as much as I do.\nQ: Did the album do what you hoped it would do? \nA: The album has hit everything that I set out to do for the first five months of promoting it, for sure. But there are a few more goals I’d like to achieve with “RADICAL” before I begin working on my next project.\nQ: You also have an indie label, TVLiFE Entertainment. What inspired you start a label? \nA: I wish I could say I had this master plan where I wanted to make this clever and well-thought-out collective that had a calculated agenda that would eventually take the music industry by storm, but it’s something that was very organic and grew out of a community of people that I’d met along the way. This time three years ago, you could find me at a completely outrageous and out-of-this-world Rubber Brothers’ show at Parliament, in the studio recording vocals for another amazing 56th Street Records album and on tour with Fairy Bones all in the same week. I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to learn and see so much firsthand back then that it really inspired a lot with what we do with TVLiFE today.\nQ: What makes an artist a good fit for TVLiFE? \nA: An artist on TVLiFE definitely approaches sound from a different angle. They’ll typically take something very conventional and turn it on its head while putting a mirror in front of it. It’s very art imitating life.\nQ: What are your plans for the new year? \nA: I’m going to shoot a few more videos and release a few more singles from the album. I’m releasing a few features with some of my favorite artists. I’m also gearing up for a run of some brand new merchandise. I’d like to lock down a few television appearances, and I’m working on a standup DVD to come by the end of the year through TVLiFE. I was born in the DIY house show scene, and I had my last album release show at one as a nod to my earlier days but my audience has gotten bigger and we’re running out of space at the smaller spots.\nThe Senators play azcentral concert, reflect on recording 'Coyotes' EP CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed\nx Share\nLocal Phoenix band the Senators play a couple songs off their new album and talk to music critic Ed Masley about the inspiration behind it. Thomas Hawthorne/azcentral.com \nThe Senators are releasing a four-song EP called “Coyotes” that should have no problem speaking to fans of their earlier work while allowing for growth and experimentation with new musical approaches.\nFront man Jesse Teer says, “When you listen, it’s clear this is a departure from what we’ve done in the past. But, to me, it draws a pretty clear line from where we started to where we are now.”\nSince the previous release from the Phoenix local band, he says, “life has been full of really high highs for me, and really low lows. I got married, I traveled Europe, I wrote some of the best music I’ve ever written about love and life. But, I also lost my relationship with my brother, who used to be a major part of the Senators. I put my trust in a manager who left us with not much more than a lot of debt and disappointment. My longtime drummer and one of my best friends had to leave the band for his growing family. We all had to face life. In the end, I pretty much had to start from scratch. Now, we’ve brought in some really amazing players, played with arrangements, experimented with genres and come back to a better place than before.”\n'This EP is how I brought myself out of all of that conflict and loss' Teer and his brother, Adam, “had some personal conflict that unavoidably spilled over into the music,” Teer explains. “It was a tough time as a band, and we really set some things back. It definitely hurts that he's estranged to me now, but I'm hopeful.”\nYou can hear their folk roots shining through the haunting electronic textures of the title track, and Teer says he wrote every song on acoustic guitar.\n“But this EP is how I brought myself out of all of that conflict and loss,” he continues. “I figured the best answer to hurt is hope and love. So, that’s what I wrote. There are love songs, nostalgic ones, hopeful ones. And, I played with the genre. I love folk music because it’s honest. And I love honest-sounding instruments. So, I wanted to take things that are synthetic -- like synth and 808 drums -- and make them feel really honest, bare and emotional here.”\nThe title track is “about a feeling,” Teer says, “one of nostalgia for young love.”\n“Carlos Song” is a tribute to their original banjo player, who passed away. “Hummingbird” is about Teer’s wife (“who reminds me an awful lot of a bright hummingbird sometimes,” Teer says). “Fits and Starts” is what he calls a “process” song. “I wrote it to feature harmonica and acoustic guitar and a bunch of group vocal,” he says, “but it turned into this cool arrangement with a ton of horns and 808 drums and now it just sounds like a celebration.”\nRecording a full album in 2017 Teer and his bandmates self-produced the EP, recorded in Phoenix with David Thibodeaux at 9th Symphony Productions.\n“Dave typically does live orchestral and symphonic recordings,” Teer says. “And I really liked the idea of mixing up the approach. He took the songs through a lot of analog on the back-end, and I love the tone and texture he got out of them.”\nThe cover art is by a Phoenix artist, Danielle Hacche at Maius Studio.\n“She’s incredibly talented,” Teer says. “And I love the idea of marrying local visual art with music.”\nThe Senators are heading to New York in April to record a full album with Simone Felice, who just produced the Lumineers’ sophomore release, which topped the Billboard album charts last year.\n“What I’m writing for that album is much more raw, folk inspired, stripped down,” Teer says. “But I love this EP. I love its message.”\nMORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL: Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest \nReach the reporter at ed.masley@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4495.
