The request has since been forwarded to the Speaker for onward transmission to the Senate where it would be referred to the relevant committee.

I vehemently oppose it,” Mr Kilonzo Jr said, adding that there is no guarantee that the law enforcement agents will ensure compliance. \n“Bhang has medicinal value but we have abused its values. If the lobby group are doctors or pharmacists, a good argument can be made,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T05:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T04:18:47.844+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
