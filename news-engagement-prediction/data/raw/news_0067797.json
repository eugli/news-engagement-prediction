It last traded for $17.25 million in 2013, with the Jills having been the listing agents at that time as well. 28 photos “The Hilfigers had this estate designed to be a glamorous, sexy home where they could showcase their amazing collection of artwork, as well as incorporate a ‘groovy,’ colorful 1960s/1970s feel,” said Hertzberg. “This estate is truly a unique, spectacular find in Golden Beach, perfect for the luxury buyer who enjoys upscale, beachfront living.” Built in 2007, the mansion sits on a 27,500-square-foot lot and features an infinity pool along a private beach. It has seven bedrooms, eight bathrooms, and four half bathrooms. The home features an elevator, a black marble staircase, scratch-and-sniff fruit wallpaper on some bathroom walls, and a private office with the blue and red Hilfiger brand colors. The home was designed by Martyn Lawrence Bullard . “This estate is pure Hilfiger style,” Eber said. “Designed with vibrant colors and a Studio 54 style, the estate is a beachfront gem in exclusive Golden Beach. Having sold this home to the Hilfigers four years ago, we are elated to once again showcase it to prospective buyers.” Brian Bandell covers real estate, foreclosures and health care.
