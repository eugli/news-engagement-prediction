We have no doubt but that further investigation relative to the clothing and voice verification will corroborate the above assertions.”\nJust because someone is bragging about doing something doesn’t mean he did it, and the lawyers will have to prove that the voice on the video doesn’t belong to Revis. But this is clearly going to be a big part of their defense, based on the statement.\nRevis turned himself in last week after being charged with four felonies and a misdemeanor. He was released on bond. The case comes at a bad time, as far as his NFL career is concerned, because Revis’ play slipped last season and the Jets were already reportedly considering cutting him. The Jets are figuring out if they can recoup the final $6 million in guaranteed money due to Revis if they cut him, the New York Daily News said . Revis is due a $2 million roster bonus on March 10, the second day of the league year, and a decision on his future will likely be made by then.\nRevis has bigger issues than football at the moment, but his lawyers seem to think the video that was made public last weekend will help his case.\nDarrelle Revis was charged with four felonies after an alleged altercation in Pittsburgh.
