Prince Frederick and Princess Mary of Denmark recently enjoyed a fun-filled holiday there with their four children and shared sweet photos from their adventures, while Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice of York take an annual trip with their father Prince Andrew , who owns a chalet in the Swiss mountains. \nJust a short flight away for many of the royals, it's no surprise that Verbier is their ski destination of choice. Hailed as \"one of the premiere 'off-piste' resorts in the Alps and in the world\", the Swiss town has everything you need for a luxurious getaway including opulent accommodation, restaurants serving up fine dining and some cosy bars which are perfect for taking in the views while you make the most of après-ski. Feb 16, 2017 at 11:56pm PST Princess Mary and her daughter Princess Isabella posed for a selfie in a recent trip to Verbier \nBecause of its secluded and exclusive chalets, the resort also offers royals a haven of privacy where they can enjoy their downtime in peace – so it's not surprising that Eugenie and Beatrice are often joined by friends or other members of the royal family such as Prince Harry when they hit the slopes. It's no doubt a particularly special resort for Eugenie as it was where she first met boyfriend Jack Brooksbank . VIEW GALLERY Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie have been visiting Verbier ever since they were little \nThe slopes themselves are perfect for more experienced skiers like Harry. Not only do they include over 400km of runs and challenging terrains that play host to thrilling Xtreme events, but they also boast incredible views of the mountains: you can even catch a glimpse of the Matterhorn and Mont Blanc from some of them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:10:10.789+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
