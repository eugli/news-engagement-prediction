Picture: NIGEL HALLETT AAP \nPET owners be warned — a shark swimming off a Sydney beach has managed to get its pincers on a pooch. \nThis weekend a pet dog was taken by a shark while it swam off a south Sydney beach. \nAuthorities from Sutherland Shire Council say the pet dog was in waters at the off-leash beach at Bonna Point in Kurnell on Sunday evening when he was attacked. \nLifeguards were patrolling Kurnell beaches on Monday to warn people to keep out of the water, the council said. \nSigns have also been installed to alert the public to the shark sighting. “NSW Department of Primary Industries advises people to avoid swimming or surfing when it is dark or during twilight hours and encourages the use of the SharkSmart app which has safety tips for swimmers, surfers, divers, snorkellers and spearfishers,” the council said in a statement. \nAccording to the Taronga Australian Shark Attack Fact File there have been nine attacks in NSW since the beginning of 2016. At least five of those have occurred in northern NSW, close to the town of Ballina, including the death of Japanese surfer Tadashi Nakahara in early 2015. \nIn a bid to keep swimmers safe, the state government announced in February that up to 100 ‘smart’ drum lines will placed along the NSW coastline with the focus in the state’s north. \nThere are already 15 smart drum lines off NSW and another 85 will be rolled out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T03:19:11.533+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
