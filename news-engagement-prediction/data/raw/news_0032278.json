PHOTO BY CLARIZEL ABANILLA \nKapamilya power love team Enrique Gil and Liza Soberano believe that while inner beauty is the most important thing in choosing a partner, physical beauty is also a factor. \nLizQuen, as they are known as a pair, say they prefer to have good-looking partners. \nAt a recent blog conference for their upcoming Star Cinema Valentine offering “My Ex and Whys,” bloggers and entertainment press alike got more up close and personal with the stars of the Valentine movie event of the year wherein they shared their thoughts on the importance of looks in looking for a partner. ” ADVERTISEMENT \n“Syempre malaking factor siya, it’s not everything, it’s not the main thing but malaking factor din siya. Syempre gusto mo pag-gising mo sa umaga, ganda ng gising mo ganda din ng katabi mo di ba. Di naman pwede (all inner beauty), syempre kailanga balanse,” said Enrique Gil. \nThe beautiful Liza Soberano also shared the same thoughts with her “My Ex and Whys” co-star. “To be honest, yun naman talaga yung unang makikita mo. You can’t get a crush on somebody ng biglaan, siyempre sa itsura naman talaga yung reason kung bakit ka nagkakagusto sa isang tao.” \nThe Kapamilya actress said, however, that it will also be a major turn-off for her if someone looks great yet carries ill manners as well or is not intellectual. \n“But then kung pogi nga, masama naman ugali or hindi ganon ka-brainy, matu-turn off ka rin at hindi din magtatagal yung relationship,” she stressed. \nRecently, the trailer for their Valentine movie went viral because of Liza’s ronic line, “Pangit ba ako?” which she asked during a quarrel scene with Enrique. It set the online world abuzz as the line actually was uttered by someone as beautiful as Soberano. \nEnrique ended by saying, “Pag meron ka namang crush hindi mo kaagad mahal, gusto mo lang, pag nakilala mo na dun lang.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T13:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T09:01:37.618+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
