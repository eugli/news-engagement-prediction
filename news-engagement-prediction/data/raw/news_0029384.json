Sheriff Ric Bradshaw says he's confident the money will be reimbursed by the federal government. The county's administrator, Verdenia Baker, says she hopes he's correct. The Palm Beach Post ( http://bit.ly/2kmo6Z1 ) reports the county has sent letters to federal officials seeking reimbursement for security costs during a five-day Trump visit to his south Florida estate called Mar-a-lago in November. The costs were originally estimated at $250,000, but Bradshaw says it will be closer to $300,000. Bradshaw says the security costs are amounting to about $60,000 a day during Trump's visits. Trump stayed at Mar-a-lago 16 days in December. He has returned for two weekends so far in February. ——— Information from: The Palm Beach (Fla.)
