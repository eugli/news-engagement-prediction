Or his Cinematic Life, as director Sally Aitken puts it in the title of her feature documentary, which supplements the void left by ABC TV’s At the Movies with a veritable Stratts-fest. \nLinking the life of its semiretired presenter (still a reviewer for the Australian) with the story of how (and which) locally made movies have left a big impression on him, the film is a sweet ode to our national cinema and a moving portrait of the beloved avuncular cinephile. The stars come out in force to salute Stratton: a Nicole Kidman here, a Russell Crowe there, and a long list of other notable names – from George Miller to Gillian Armstrong. Ozflix and chill: do we really need a streaming platform just for Australian films? | Luke Buckmaster Read more \nThe presence of another kind of star can be felt: the kind that exists on a scale of one to five. A Cinematic Life begins with Stratton at home taking the viewer through his old-school filing system, a proto-IMDB comprising small pieces of cardboard with titles on them categorised under the name of their director. Stratton estimates he has seen around 25,000 films (excluding rewatches) with one of the first being The Overlanders . He saw – and reviewed it – when he just seven years old. \nIt is far from unusual for Stratton to jump front of the camera, of course; his cachet as an erudite local celeb was gleaned through years of friendly sparring with television co-host Margaret Pomeranz . Nor is it unprecedented to be given accounts of his off-screen life, which has proven surprisingly event-filled for a man who has spent so much time in darkened auditoriums. \nStratton’s 2008 autobiography, I Peed on Fellini, begins with the writer recounting how, after several champagnes at a party in Venice in the 60s, he accidentally urinated on the shoes of one of his idols, Federico Fellini. It also, like A Cinematic Life, covers off on dramatic moments including Stratton’s campaign against censorship (as director of Sydney film festival) and the wrath he incurred from the film-maker Geoffrey Wright, who once threw a glass of wine on him as payback for being unkind towards Romper Stomper . \nIt is unusual, however, for a documentary to marry the personal and cinematic in such a way as Aitken, who uses the presenter’s emotional and circumstantial experiences to draw connections to Australian cinema (and vice versa). A “ 10-pound pom ” who migrated to Australia in 1963, Stratton reminisces early in the piece that he felt like fellow (fictional) Brit John Grant from Wake in Fright – a nervous newcomer to a sun-baked and beer-stained land. This observation springboards a brief discussion of the film’s legacy, including interviews with cast and crew. \nWhen Stratton says “like Muriel Heslop, I know what it’s like to be the black sheep of the family”, we learn he was destined (at least in his father’s eyes) to inherit the family trade: a retail grocery company called Stratton Sons & Mead. Five generations of Strattons had run the store since 1824. David Stratton: ‘I know what it’s like to be the black sheep of the family’ Photograph: Mark Rogers \nAitken and editor Adrian Rostirolla (finely managing a herculean task) then segue into a discussion of Muriel’s Wedding . From that they branch out into Lantana and Australian family dramas more broadly, such as the films of Paul Cox (to whom A Cinematic Life is dedicated). You can see how the structure works, with tangential connections spurring subconnections and Stratton’s presence at the root of it. David and Margaret – the head and heart of Australian film culture Read more \nOccasionally the film feels a little disjointed, trying to encapsulate too much in too short a time. Perhaps this has something to do with it being just one incarnation of the project. A Cinematic Life will also air on ABC TV later in the year as a miniseries comprised of three one-hour episodes, essentially doubling the documentary’s 97-minute running time. It’ll be interesting to see whether the expanded format skews towards more films or more David. \nGeorge Miller presented and directed a similarly structured documentary about Australian cinema, 1997’s 40,000 Years of Dreaming. It also begins with observations drawn from his life and childhood but evolves into an overstuffed and convoluted history lesson. A Cinematic Life fares better. Aitken and her producers (including executive producer Jennifer Peedom, who recently directed Sherpa ) understand the best way to retain audience interest is through the main attraction. \nThe film has a surprisingly wide emotional range, spanning laugh-out-loud moments (including Margaret’s assessment of the literature David consumed as a boy) to times of pathos and poignancy. When Stratton reflects on the distanced relationship he had with his father, the presenter’s eyes welling up when he concedes he was probably a nasty child – well, this critic also experienced a bit of inflammation in the tear gland. From The Americans to Drunk History: the best film and TV streaming in Australia this month Read more \nAn experienced hand in analysing other people’s stories, Stratton reveals the same kind of intellectual distance necessary to consider his own: a critic through and through. His highly affecting Cinematic Life (a superior work to the recent Roger Ebert documentary, Life Itself ) ultimately puts forward a message that it is better to be a good person than it is to be a great critic. The veteran reviewer might not be sharing his thoughts on this particular film, but it’s hard to think he wouldn’t agree. \n• David Stratton: A Cinematic Life will be released in Australian cinemas on 9 March, with Q&A screenings around the country from late February. \n• Disclaimer: Luke Buckmaster was a consultant to the film during early (pre-filming) stages of production.
