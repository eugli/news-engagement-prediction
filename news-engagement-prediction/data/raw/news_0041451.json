Specifically, Trump tweeted Friday evening: \"The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!\"\n\"Should we take that seriously from him?\", Dickerson asked .\n\"Well, I think you should take it seriously,\" Priebus replied, before echoing his boss in accusing various outlets for publishing inaccurate stories on intelligence leaks.\nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox.\nSorry, there was a problem processing your email signup.

The next day, the Wall Street Journal had a story that the intel community was not giving the president a full intelligence briefing. Both stories grossly inaccurate, overstated, overblown, and it's total garbage.\n\"So we spend, you know, 48 hours on bogus stories,\" he continued. \"And the American people suffer. So I do think it's a problem. And I think that the media needs to, in some cases, not every case, John, but in some cases really needs to get its act together.\"\nDickerson pressed him on whether that does mean the press is the \"enemy,\" as Trump suggested.\n\"Well, if you're not — if the theory is that the press is supposed to be a free forum of information to speak to the American people, I think it ought to be accurate,\" Priebus said. \"And I think we've gotten to a place, John, where the media is willing to run with unnamed sources, apparently false leaked documents to create stories. I mean, we deal with one after the next. I think that the media should stop with this unnamed source stuff, put names on a piece of paper and print it. If people aren't willing to put their name next to a quote, then the quote shouldn't be listed. Period.\"\nLater in the interview Priebus defended former National Security Advisor Mike Flynn for communicating with a Russian envoy about sanctions before the election.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Trump: The Obama EPA was 'clogging up the veins of our country', Pruitt will fix that \"He'll do so good,\" the president said Saturday.\nBy Daniel Chaitin • 02/18/17 8:44 PM \"There was nothing wrong with talking to the foreign — the Russian ambassador — about the current sanctions that were being put in place by the Obama administration,\" he said .\nFlynn resigned Monday amid fallout resulting from reports that he misled Vice President Mike Pence about his communications with Russia, and reportedly may have been susceptible to blackmail.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T04:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T05:39:28.866+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
