Also in the posh seats was Steve Parish, the Crystal Palace chairman, on his phone for much of the first half, presumably attempting to wrap up the signings of the Everton striker Arouna Koné and Luka Milivojevic from Olympiakos. \nPalace made seven changes from Saturday’s defeat at home to Manchester City, with Wilfried Zaha back in the starting lineup for the first time since returning from the Africa Cup of Nations with the Ivory Coast. Andros Townsend, a loan target for his former club, Newcastle United, was named among Allardyce’s substitutes. \nIt was 10 days since Bournemouth’s last match, a draw here against Watford, and it showed with Eddie Howe’s side sluggish out of the blocks. \nBournemouth struggled to deal with the aerial threats in the Palace team, just as they did against Watford. In the buildup to the fixture Howe said his squad have been stimulated by different team-bonding exercises, including a visit from Sir Clive Woodward, who won the Rugby World Cup with England in 2003, and a spending an afternoon watching the local 6 Rifles regiment, based at Poole, go about their business. \nBournemouth welcomed back their captain Simon Francis after his three-match ban but they lacked their usual bite, with Harry Arter again only on the bench. \nPalace have trailed in more Premier League games at half-time than any other side (13) but Allardyce’s side, playing a back three, looked fairly resolute and Junior Stanislas’s deflected effort that hit the side-netting was the closest the hosts came to testing Wayne Hennessey. \nIt was not the postcard image of Bournemouth, with a combination of heavy fog, sea mist and rain showers making for a largely untidy contest. Zaha returned from Gabon with a spring in his step, though, and after four minutes the winger rattled Artur Boruc’s post after toying with Andrew Surman before striking at goal. Zaha caused no end of problems, twirling away from Brad Smith one moment and leaving Joshua King for dead the next. \nPatrick van Aanholt made his first appearance in a Palace shirt since his £12m move from Sunderland and he was part of another promising attacking move. The wing-back drilled in a cross that pinballed off Christian Benteke and Steve Cook before Zaha’s fierce shot was kept out by Boruc. \nAllardyce must have worried it was going to be one of those nights, with little to show for an impressive 45 minutes. But Palace were rewarded for their efforts just 60 seconds into the second half, when Bournemouth were punished for failing to clear their lines. Jason Puncheon picked up the ball on the left flank and his cross was stabbed home by the Palace captain, Scott Dann, after Damian Delaney’s flick on. \nThe Bournemouth defender Brad Smith then got in a muddle up against Zaha and the ball fell to James McArthur, who sent a curling effort just wide of goal. \nJoshua King could have restored parity moments later but the Bournemouth forward’s header from Ryan Fraser’s free-kick landed on the roof of Hennessey’s net. \nBournemouth grew increasingly frustrated in the physical battle and Jack Wilshere, the on-loan Arsenal midfielder, was fortunate to be only booked for dissent by Jon Moss after walking away from the referee after a petty challenge on Yohan Cabaye. \nHowe made a double change, replacing Benik Afobe and Junior Stanislas with Jordon Ibe and Callum Wilson. Another Fraser free-kick caused panic for Palace, evading everybody but Francis but the ball bounced awkwardly off the thigh of the defender. \nHowe introduced Arter in a final roll of the dice, with Bournemouth moving to a more flexible and attacking shape. Arter brought with him a rain-drenched note from his manager, which Wilshere did his best to decipher. \nPalace retreated deeper and deeper in a bid to defend their lead, with Joe Ledley brought on to shore up any holes in front of the midfield. Allardyce also called upon the services of Townsend, heavily linked with a move away from Selhurst Park this window. \nBournemouth searched for an equaliser in vain as Palace stood firm, led by Dann, and urged forward by Allardyce in the closing stages. The four minutes of added time were agonising for Palace, with Wilshere’s low free-kick hitting the upright after a fingertip save by Hennessey. But soon Allardyce could relax, high-fiving his assistant, Sammy Lee and coaching staff, safe in the knowledge of victory, when Benteke nodded home Townsend’s lofted cross.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:10:08.882+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
