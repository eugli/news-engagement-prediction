SIMON O'CONNOR/Fairfax NZ. \nSenior Sergeant Karley Hunt is urging the public to be more security conscious following a spike in reported burglaries. \n\"As well as the psychological toll of being a victim of burglary, it takes considerable time and money to replace anything stolen.\" \nREAD MORE: * Recidivist burglar jailed after stealing TVs from homes \nBurglaries increased nationwide by 16 per cent in 2016, with 74,182 reported. Taranaki, along with the Nelson Bays, Hawkes Bay and Waikato East areas recorded the biggest jumps in overall crime reported. \nHunt said burglaries were often committed by opportunistic offenders and the most common items stolen was property which was often in plain sight. This included bicycles, tools, clothes and plants. \n\"Burglars tend to look for easy targets so the best way to reduce your chances of becoming a victim is to put obstacles in the offenders' way.\" she said. \nIncreased measures such as the installation of alarms and cameras or deadbolts on doors were some ways people could beef up security at home. \nResidential properties were not the only premises being targeted by thieves. Ad Feedback \nHunt said there had also been a rise in thefts from cars, burglaries from commercial premises and vehicles being stolen around the region as well. \n\"Again, our intelligence suggests that some of these crimes could have been prevented if owners had taken steps to secure their property,\" Hunt said. \nShe said if anyone noticed anything suspicious or out of place, they should contact police immediately. \n\"Police can and will react to a crime being committed. However, we'd rather prevent it from happening in the first place,\" she said. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T13:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T08:12:21.451+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
