Incredibly, she was discharged from hospital on the same day but was told she would need intensive brain and spinal cord rehabilitation. However in 2011, she suffered a delayed spinal cord break, and the creeping paralysis of her lower limbs. Nicki, from Birmingham, said: ‘I was stuck in hospital and couldn’t move. It was a prison sentence. I could feel my bones slowly crumbling away. Nicki Connelly ‘I could feel my bones slowly crumbling in my body, but there was nothing anyone could do. Emotionally I lost my soul. Being a police officer was my life and when that was taken away from me I found it very hard. ‘I went from being super-fit to literally wasting away. I could so easily have died in the car crash, then I almost died from giving up on life.’ Nicki Donnelly with her daughter Eleanor after completing the Great Run in Birmingham in October But during her year in hospital, Nicki was given hope by Eleanor. On her fifth birthday she brought a note she had written into hospital. ‘It said she loved me, that she believed in me – and that I’d be able to walk again,’ recalls Nicki, now 34. ‘I asked if she would like a party but she said “No” – her only wish was that I walk again. From that day, whenever things were bad, I’d try to remember what she said and remind myself that I was doing it for her.’ Last April Nicki and her husband – a private man she calls ‘a dream come true’ – received a call from US firm ReWalk, a leading maker of robotic exoskeletons. She said: ‘I thought it was a cold call and put the phone down. I couldn’t deal with any more heartache or broken dreams, so didn’t want to know. But I looked them up and a week later I was having it fitted.’ Courage: Recieving an award from West Midlands chief constable. She received six bravery commendations over a decade The machine – a ReWalk Robotics 6.0 Personal System Exo-skeleton – was paid for by the Gerald Ronson Family Foundation, which heard of her plight. The charity was set up by property tycoon Gerald Ronson, 77, the uncle of pop star Mark Ronson. Experts told her it could take up to two years to master it, but Nicki was walking within seven weeks. And in October she walked two miles during the Great Birmingham Run, crossing the finish line with Eleanor. Nicki wears a watch that wirelessly puts the legs in ‘sit’, ‘stand’ or ‘walk’ mode. To move, she tilts her body forward, which is detected by the machine which then takes the fist step. Nicki said: ‘When I had it fitted, Eleanor was there and watched me stand. She looked up at me for the first time – instead of looking down at me in my wheelchair – and said “My wish came true, Mummy!” We were both in floods of tears. ‘I have my independence back, a second chance to live again.’ Share or comment on this article 22", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T08:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T05:21:34.832+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
