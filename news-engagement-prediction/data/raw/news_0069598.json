Customers can get a full refund, the operator said. UK weather latest update: Storm Doris set to bring gale-force winds \nAhead of the storm, which is expected to bring damaging winds and heavy rain across the UK, more than 10,000 airline passengers have had their travel plans wrecked. \nDozens of flights for Thursday have been cancelled to and from Heathrow airport. The airport said: \"Strong winds and poor weather forecast for 23 February 23 related to Storm Doris, are expected to cause some flight delays and cancellations across the UK. \n\"If you are due to travel, please check your flight status with your airline prior to arriving at the airport.\" \nHigh winds are expected to reduce the usual arrivals rate at the UKâ€™s busiest airport. With little resilience in the system, scores of short-haul flights have been cancelled to provide \"firebreaks\" and avoid widespread disruption taking hold. \nBritish Airways has grounded more than 50 flights. \nRail passengers across the country are seeing their journeys disrupted because of the weather, National Rail said. The electricity supply at Liverpool Lime Street has failed, as has power between Crewe and Warrington Bank Quay. \nHigh winds are affecting the Southeastern network and an object has fallen onto the track at Broadstairs, blocking all lines. A similar incident has occurred at West Wickham. More about: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T14:14:08.468+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
