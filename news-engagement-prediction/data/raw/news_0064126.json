Gonzaga needed a burst of scoring, so Turner looked to Lykes, a ballhandler with flash and grit, quick enough to get to the hoop at will, smart enough to keep the Eagles out of trouble — he hoped.\nLykes has never again come off the bench again. In 125 varsity games, which included a 2-inch growth spurt, he’s averaged 16.7 points per game. His 2,085 career points are the most in Gonzaga’s storied basketball history. And he’s done it all standing 5-8 in the right pair of shoes.\nThe Washington Catholic Athletic Conference does not take kindly to ninth-grade upstarts, or to undersized guards who bring the ball in the paint and want to play among the shot blockers.\nChris Lykes does not care. He’ll be the first to tell you, followed closely by Turner, then his teammates, then his friends. When Lykes leads the fifth-ranked Eagles into Friday’s WCAC quarterfinals against Bishop Ireton, his opposition will have its hands full trying to corral the smallest player on the court.\n“I’ve seen people laugh or stare at me as to why I’m on the court with guys who are much taller than me,” Lykes said. “It’s happened so often that it doesn’t really affect me anymore.”\n[ Allen, Harvey lead DeMatha over rival Gonzaga in a WCAC thriller ] \nIn a clash at rival DeMatha last week, fans holler at him in unison, “You are short.” \n“It’s his fuel to prove somebody wrong,” Turner said.\nAfter a blocked shot, students shouted, “Little boy.”\n“He’ll go at the largest dude on the court,” Gonzaga forward Eddie Scott said. “He’s not afraid of anybody. He’ll throw his body around.”\nAnd amid the jeers, Lykes jogged down court, nailed a three-pointer and blew kisses to the rafters as if a baby bird flew from his palms. \n“Words don’t mean a lot to us anymore,” said Tyree Randolph, Lykes’ close friend and the Gonzaga football team’s all-time leading rusher. He stands 5-foot-7. “It gave us that motivation. Hearing, ‘You can’t, you can’t, you can’t,’ and then you do, it’s a great feeling.”\n\nChris Lykes is averaging 18 points per game for a Gonzaga team that features balance on the offensive end, but relies on its point guard to facilitate and produce in crunch time. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post) \nLykes (0) has never been afraid to take the ball to the basket, no matter the towering defenders between him and the rim. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post) Lykes scored 19 points in his varsity debut against O’Connell. When the Eagles trailed with two seconds remaining, Turner drew up a last-second play for his freshman: run off a screen, then make a beeline for the top of the key and get a shot off. \nHe did, and it went in, too. But Trimble helped O’Connell pull out a 75-73 win. \nThere are some losses you don’t get over. Here was one for Chris Lykes, two points away from leading his team to a season-defining win. \nLykes is always thinking about his legacy. It is inseparable from his stature and from those who question it. \n“There’s always that next level of doubt,” he says.\nIt started when he began playing basketball in second grade. He was short then, too, and immediately the stares and laughs and doubt began.\n“I’ve heard it all,” he said. \nBy middle school, he’d learned to deal with it all. By high school, he emerged on the AAU circuit as a flashy point guard who played with a chip on his shoulder. He and Randolph adopted the motto “heart over height,” pinning it on social media posts and embedding it in their lifestyle.\nLykes has the phrase pasted over a photo of Allen Iverson as his phone background. \n[ Wilson boys win first title since 1984; Mya Moye leads Anacostia past Bell ] \nWhen colleges started recruiting him, scouts wondered if he could get his shot away in the nation’s top basketball conferences, Turner said, or if bigger players would simply shove him out of the way in the open floor.\n“I know coaches shied away from him because of his size,” said Turner, who once was also an undersized point guard at Blair. \n“But he’s going to be the guy who knocks you out of the tournament,” he told them. \nLykes looked for a college coach who embraced those doubts, who saw the race-car type point guard as his team’s leader. He found Jim Larranaga at Miami, a coach who more than once was handed doubts and turned in results. His 2006 George Mason team defeated a host of basketball blue bloods on the way to a Final Four appearance. \nAgainst North Carolina, he told the Patriots they were “kryptonite” to the Tar Heels’ Superman. At Miami six years later, he turned 5-foot-10 point guard Shane Larkin into a first-round NBA draft pick.\n“He saw a coach that trusted guys like him and wanted guys like him,” Turner said of his point guard.\nThat’s what made Turner decide to recruit Lykes in the first place, he said. Turner knows the doubters. He played against them in high school and college. Now he strategizes against them, the coaches that will send lanky forwards to try to trap Lykes in the corner.\nTurner puts a dry-erase marker on a whiteboard and maps Lykes around it. There’s something in those Xs and Os more than running an offense. It’s a statement of identity and having been there before. \n“He has to be me on the court,” Turner said.\nWhich means Turner has to be Lykes on the sideline — at least for this year’s team — coaching with the same flair and energy his point guard exudes on the floor. After that three-pointer against DeMatha, Turner threw a fist-pump across his chest and stomped his foot down in celebration. \n“If he’s not one of the best players in the country,” DeMatha Coach Mike Jones said afterward, “I don’t know who is.”\nThese moments are glimpses into the future for Lykes — opportunities to cast off the doubts Nobody cares if you’re a short basketball coach or engineer, which is what Lykes wants to study at Miami. They care, at some point, if and only if you can get the job done.\nLykes can, his teammates say. When friends and family ask junior forward Myles Dread who the Eagles’ little point guard is, he tells them, “Wait and see. I’m his biggest fan.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:25:01.497+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
