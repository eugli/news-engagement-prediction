After Saif and Kareena, the latest one to face the ire was YouTuber, Ssumier Pasricha, who is popular as Pammi Aunty. It all happened when Ssumier, as Pammi Aunty, posted a video talking about the whole controversy. In the video, Pammi Aunty says that a name does not reflect a person’s character. For example, she reasons, a child named after the Gods could also grow up to be a hardened criminal. However, recently , the actor’s manager started getting calls, demanding that the video be pulled down as it hurts their sentiments. \nSpeaking to BT, Ssumier said, “It was a sarcastic take on how people take names so seriously . Though the video was posted in December, my manager started getting calls a few weeks ago. Some people, who claimed to be members of a right-wing organisation and followers of a controversial Godman,threatened me with dire consequences if I didn’t apologise and pull down the video. I took it easy for sometime, but my manager was so harassed, he had to stop taking business calls. So I pulled it down a week ago.” Speaking further on the issue he added, “The video wasn’t created with an intention to offend anyone; I wasn’t targeting anybody. It’s their problem if they took it personally. People should take things lightly and let others be.” \nWhen he was asked by BT, if he’s setting a wrong example by succumbing up to the hatred, he said, “I wouldn’t have done it, but I didn’t want my manager or his work to suffer.” Also read: Not Taimur, Kareena Kapoor Khan calls her baby boy by THIS new name \nTalking about the controversy, Saif Ali Khan has stated that he, for a brief moment, he had considered changing the name of his baby boy after the backlash. Talking to Delhi Times, he had said, “Kareena was a little against it and she said, ‘People respect you for your opinion and you can’t’… So I said, yeah, but it’s not about people. I don’t want him to get unpopular. And I still might, maybe when he’s one or two, I might change his name in a while, it’s still sinking in, what to do.” In fact he also revealed that he sat down with his PR personnel and drafted a note but dropped the idea, he said, “It was so pathetic that I cancelled the idea. Because it was really like, uhh, ‘I’m sorry’, and ‘I didn’t want to offend’ and ‘I’m an idiot’ (laughs), and you know, I’ve given in to pressure. It just sounded awful.” Published:  51 pm Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T19:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T14:30:02.536+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
