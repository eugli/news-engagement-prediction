RECORD BREAKERS? \nWrestleMania 32 took place at the AT&T Stadium in Arlington Texas, and McMahon’s aim was to break their own attendance record which they set at WrestleMania 3 inside of the Pontiac Silverdome.

Article continues below EXAGGERATION \nHe explained: “That included ushers and ticket-takers. It wasn’t 101,000 paid.” \nHe made it clear that the figure they stuck with also included people with free tickets, people who didn’t have tickets and surprisingly, the event staff there on the day. \nWhile WWE stuck with that figure for their live broadcast of WrestleMania 32, as well as in their press releases on the website for the investors, Fightful.com have revealed what the actual numbers could be. \nThey wrote: “We can deduce from WWE’s own Key Performance Indicator documents that the number of tickets actually sold to the event was somewhere between 73,711 and 85,888.” \nWhile it comes as no real surprise that WWE inflated the original number to break the 100,000 barrier, it will probably result in fans not believing any other attendance figures they release in the future. \nEither way, he and the investors probably made a lot of money from the event anyway, even if fans hated how the show ended. \nWhat do you make of Vince McMahon’s comments on the WrestleMania attendance?
