Peter King in Massapequa Park — capping a week of demonstrations against President Donald Trump’s executive orders on immigration. \nThe marchers responded to a call to action from a loose network of immigrant advocates, civil rights groups and progressive groups that organized online. They were responding to policies that the Trump administration has said are intended to curtail the terror threat and illegal immigration.

Story What we know, don't know about the travel ban Editorial Editorial: Trump’s immigration order wrong More coverage Latest on President Trump's travel ban \nBoth sides raised the American flag and chanted “USA!” at different times, though the demonstrations remained peaceful. \nThe travel restrictions are “a very dangerous ban” on Muslims “that is not only unconstitutional but un-American,” said Liuba Grechen Shirley of Amityville, an organizer of New York Second District Democrats, which called for the protest. “Refugees are not perpetrators of terrorism. They are the victims of terrorism.” \nKing (R-Seaford) became the focal point of protests because he has supported Trump’s latest executive order, temporarily restricting travel to the United States from seven Muslim-majority nations and suspending refugee programs. Another Trump order had called for a wall to be erected along the U.S.-Mexico border. \n  \nIn an interview before the event, King told Newsday that while he’s critical of the Trump orders’ messy implementation, he supports efforts to make the country safe and better vet immigrants, refugees and visitors. \n“I’m working to make sure that all Americans are safe. That is my focus,” King said. Nation Trump's noteworthy tweets as president \nJohn Sechko, a Massapequa Park resident who was among counter-protesters, said he was there to back King and Trump.
