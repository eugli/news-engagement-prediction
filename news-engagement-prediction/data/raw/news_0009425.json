Marc Fisher Footwear, a closely held shoe company, is the licensee for the products. Despite the Nordstrom setback, Ivanka Trump's brand continues to push into new categories: it recently added baby bedding and fashion jewelry.\nThe first daughter's handbags, a large parts of her business with the shoes, are licensed by Mondani and carried by Macy’s department stores, which dropped her father’s dress shirts and accessories in 2015 after he characterised Mexican immigrants as \"rapists\". \nCo-president Pete Nordstrom addressed the controversy surrounding the partnership in a November email to employees, according to Fortune . He said the company had heard from customers threatening to boycott the chain if they continued or discontinued its relationship with Ivanka Trump.\n\"This is a sharply divisive subject,\" he said. \"No matter what we do, we are going to end up disappointing some of our customers. Every single brand we offer is evaluated on their results -- if people don't buy it, we won't sell it.\"\nIn November, the company posted a response on Twitter to a shopper's open letter calling for Nordstrom to stop selling the brand.\n\"We hope that offering a vendor's products isn't misunderstood as us taking a political position; we're not, the company said at the time. We recognise our customers can make choices about what they purchase based on personal views and we'll continue to give them options.\"\nProfile | Ivanka Trump", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T12:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T08:07:29.773+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
