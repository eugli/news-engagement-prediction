He made the comments on CNN with Anderson Cooper Thursday. \n“In the shadow of the expansion of immigration enforcement,” Cooper asked, “the Trump administration, they’re leaving in place the protections they say were put in place for ‘DREAMers’ and documented parents of U.S. citizens. What do you make of that decision? Does that, do you think that is permanent? Does that calm some fears?” \n“I hope so,” Ramos answered. \nI’ve been listening to Donald Trump for a year and a half and he’s been saying that he has a “big heart.” I hope that he shows that big heart with the DREAMers, we’re talking about 750,000 DREAMers. He hasn’t done anything against them right now. But he can do much better. He can legalize them if he really wants to. \nAnd just go beyond that. Right now President Trump has control of both chambers of Congress. He could have legalization of 11 million with one signature. And he simply doesn’t want to do that. So I think we have to be very clear that there are two completely different options. They can go with enforcement and scare the population and make sure everyone is leaving, as they are doing right now. \n“Or go the civilized way,” he advised, “follow the U.S. tradition, and legalize the 11 million as they have done with me and many others in the past.” . @jorgeramosnews : I hope Trump shares that ‘big heart’ with the DREAMers. He can legalize them. https://t.co/KgPfZgy3qG \nRamos has been an outspoken critic of the Trump administration, saying that the border wall won’t work and is a waste of time. He and Fox News’ hosts have had a number of epic debates , but none compared to his berating of then-candidate Trump at a press conference, which led to his being kicked out unceremoniously. \nRamos has been so vociferous in his near-advocacy of regularization of illegal aliens that many have accused him of betraying journalism and veering into political activism.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T11:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T06:09:14.413+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
