Nor would it affect foreign travellers already flying to the US when the order takes effect, he added. \nMeanwhile, the Associated Press quoted a senior administration official on Monday as saying the new order would target people from the same seven countries. But it would no longer demand that border authorities singled out and rejected Syrian refugees when processing new visa applications. \nThis has not been confirmed and the draft could change before it is signed by the president. How will it be implemented? Media caption Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson said the travel ban was adopted with \"little thought, little planning, little oversight\" \nThe original order triggered a lot confusion and uncertainty. Scores of people were detained at airports or in transit, with many more stranded or forced to return to where they came from. \nUS government officials complained that the roll-out had been chaotic, and there was a lack of guidance before the policy was announced on 27 January. \nMr Kelly said this time around, his department would ensure that \"there's no one... caught in the system of moving from overseas to our airports, which happened on the first release\". \nHe said there would be a \"short phase-in period\" and immigration officials would \"make sure that people on the other end don't get on airplanes\". \nThe impact on US embassies as well as airports and border crossings will be closely watched. Will it answer legal questions? \nThe president's spokesman says it will. Sean Spicer told reporters at Tuesday's White House press briefing that the second order would be \"tailored to achieve the same goals\" as the first \"but in accordance with what the [appeals] court said\". \nOne of the concerns that the judges in San Francisco cited when they refused to reinstate the original ban earlier this month was the way it was rolled out. They said the justice department had failed to show that the executive order gave enough \"notice and a hearing prior to restricting an individual's ability to travel\". Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Donald Trump hit out at judges who refused to reinstate his ban \nWhether the \"short phase-in period\" described by My Kelly will be sufficient will be one thing that legal experts are likely to examine. \nThey will also ask whether the Trump administration can prove that the order is needed to keep the country safe. \nIn its ruling, the appeals court judges found \"no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the order\" had committed a terrorist attack in the US. \nMeanwhile the exclusion of Syrians in January's order was also problematic. \nThe Immigration and Nationality Act says no person can be \"discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person's race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence\". Will it be a Muslim ban? Media caption Muslim students on Trump ban: 'I don't belong here' \nThe fact that the countries included in the original ban are all majority Muslim lends weight to the critics's argument that the order is \"anti-Muslim\". \nOn 14 February, a US district judge in Virginia ruled the the ban was unconstitutional because it had religious bias at its heart. \nA source quoted by CNN said that the new order would address religious discrimination issues by removing a particular section that said that refugees' claims should be prioritised \"on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality\". \nMr Trump previously said priority should be given to persecuted Christians. Will opponents continue to fight it? \nPresident Trump's hardline policies on immigration have sparked protests and several lawsuits around the country. \nAfter the appeals court refused to reinstate his ban, Mr Trump tweeted: \"Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!\" \nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Tuesday that Mr Trump was still confident his initial order would prevail. \nBut until that time, \"we will have a dual track system and make sure we implement a second executive order\", he said. \nThe idea of a second order does not seem to have quelled opposition. Fresh demonstrations are being organised and civil rights groups have said they will continue to challenge the president in the courts. \nDepending on what is in the revised version, the Trump administration will likely now be asked to justify two orders instead of one.
