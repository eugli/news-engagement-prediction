Read More Ever wanted to work at Manchester Airport? There are 1,000 jobs available \nLast February, the airport released video giving a pilot’s-eye view of runways, taxiways, a new road system and queue-busting check-in technology, but this latest footage takes us further into the project. \nThe centrepiece appears to be a huge living wall, decked out in evergreens and flowing over both floors of the terminal. Perched upon the wall is a giant bee - known as a symbol of Manchester’s industrious past and present. The floor is marked out in a honeycomb hexagonal print, while geometric shapes hang over the lounge from the high glass roof. \nFurther on, a seating area is another green oasis, leading on to an expansive ‘market’, with a large space for dining, restaurants and bars - and more shopping. \nIn the children’s area, logs and trees surround play equipment.

The entire project will be complete by 2023, but major changes will be noticeable as early as 2019. The plan comes with the promise of faster check-in and security checks, as well as a speedier journey through immigration and baggage claim. \nKen O’Toole, Manchester Airport CEO, said: “Manchester Airport recently joined the list of Europe’s top 20 airports, having handled more passengers than ever before in our history. \n“We also know we are among the best airports in the world when it comes to the number of different destinations on offer, whether that be Boston, Beijing or Barcelona; Houston, Hong Kong or Hamburg. \n“Our £1bn Transformation Programme is all about investing in the future, so we can continue to grow by securing more direct flight services in our role as the North’s global gateway. But it also about investing in our facilities and in the latest technology to provide passengers with best possible experience. \n“These new images showcase the look, feel and quality that will be delivered by the Transformation Project, which is one of the largest private sector investments in the North of England in decades.” IN PICTURES: The Airport of the future View gallery \nImprovements will include: \n- A new access ramp from the M56 Spur giving direct access to the new departures forecourt, which will be on the existing car park roof. \n- A ‘luxury’ Terminal Two with nearly 900,000 sq ft added, double height ceilings, lots of glass, light and a big open space \n- Improved security to cut peak queuing time from 15 to 10 minutes and off-peak to five minutes \n- Automatic bag-drops \n- More space and comfort in the departure lounge and at the gate \n- A new apron with more airside space for more aircraft \n- An extension to the Terminal Two multi-storey car park \n- Bigger taxiway to allow two aircraft - like the Boeing 777 and a Boeing 747 - to pass each other. \n- A new baggage hall with latest technology \n- Three piers with stands for aircraft to allow smooth take-offs and departures \n- Green features of a carbon neutral terminal, including free cooling technology and combined heat and power Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T11:07:46.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
