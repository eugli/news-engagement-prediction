The first was in November at Trump Tower, just 10 days after Trump's win and before he took the oath of office.\nBut it will be a first for Abe's wife, Akie, and first lady Melania Trump, who would traditionally play hostess to the spouse of the foreign leader, though the White House has yet to confirm if this will be the case. The task of entertaining the wife or husband of a dignitary falls to the first lady, often in the form of visiting schools, or cultural monuments or having a luncheon or other small social event. For Melania Trump, should she be Akie Abe's escort for the day in Washington, this will be the first time since the inauguration that her role as first lady will be on public display. She could choose to take a cue from her predecessor, Michelle Obama, who was a frequent partner to the wives' of leaders her husband was busy meeting with in the West Wing.

Michelle Obama gave her a tour of the White House Kitchen Garden, and they watched some schoolchildren give a quick performance.

In August, it was Michelle Obama's turn to treat Singapore's first lady, Ho Ching, to a visit to the National Gallery of Art and learn some fun facts, like this portrait, the last of Abraham Lincoln before he grew his famous beard. First Lady Michelle Obama and Ho Ching(C), wife of Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong look at a portrait of the 16th President of the US, Abraham Lincoln as they are escorted through the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC, August 2, 2016 by Museum Director Earl \"Rusty\" Powell III.

President Barack Obama and the first lady are hosting the heads of the five nations for a U.S.-Nordic Leaders Summit. Michelle Obama has hosted Akie Abe, too. It was back in April of 2015. They went to Great Falls, Virginia, to visit ... schoolchildren. US First Lady Michelle Obama (R), and Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe's wife Akie Abe meet students during a tour of the Great Falls Elementary School in Great Falls, Virginia on April 28, 2015. What Michelle Obama did not ever have was a private beachfront club at her disposal, whereas Melania Trump has that in Mar-a-Lago. Laura Bush didn't have Mar-a-Lago, but she did have a ranch in Crawford, Texas. And if Melania Trump entertains Akie Abe in Florida over the weekend -- the Abes are scheduled Friday afternoon to fly down to Mar-a-Lago as guests of the President -- she could to look to Bush, who in 2004 hosted then-Mexico President Vicente Fox and his wife, Marta Sahagun de Fox. The first couple of Mexico made a visit to the Bush family's ranch, where they went hiking. US President George W. Bush (L) holds the hand of First Lady Laura Bush as Mexican President Vicente Fox (R) and his wife Marta follow along after visiting a waterfall on Bush's ranch in Crawford. The two leaders were hoping the weekend visit might reestablish a rapport that was damaged by US irritation at Mexico for its refusal to support the Iraq war.

Laura Bush also had some time with Akie Abe; in 2007, during a visit by Prime Minister Abe to the White House, the first lady took her on tour of Mount Vernon. There were, however, no schoolchildren.
