The standard ‘Schengen’ wire for €50 per meter, and the more luxurious, gold-plated ‘Secession’ line at €250 per meter. \nThe wires come with an added electric shock function, which Happy Homes representative Peter Tappler warned is “a bit sketchy.” \n“You need to do that bit in secret, so that you don't get into conflict with the law,” he explained. “Especially if somebody is touching it, a fatality could occur.

Another attendee, Peter, wasn’t so sure though, describing the fence as being “a bit too rough” and “too brutal,” while also comparing it to looking “a bit like a prison.” \nPeter need not have worried, as the barbed wire display is, in fact, an elaborate social experiment created by actors wishing to gauge people’s reaction to the imagined product. #Artless protest: All work created by immigrants to be axed by US Davis Museum https://t.co/JKMNz5iH0v pic.twitter.com/FMf7iB585J — RT (@RT_com) February 17, 2017 \nTappler, who posed as the Happy Home representative is an actor from the Austrian theater group Stahlglatt & Blumeenweich, who even created a website as part of the performance. \n\"We are doing this, because we want to continue the discourse about security-technology and the calls for higher security,” he explained. “We want to find out how visitors of this exhibition react to such offer. This offer is absolutely fictitious. The offer in reality does not exist.
