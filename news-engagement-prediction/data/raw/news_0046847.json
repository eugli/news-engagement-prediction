No-one was hurt. \nThe wake was for Frank Pereira, a man from Moss Side thought to have been in his 70s when he passed away. \nPolice sources have indicated some of his associates were linked to Moss Side’s notorious Gooch gang.

I want to offer my assurances that we have extra patrols in the area and a dedicated team of detectives working on this case. \n“Our enquiries are at an early stage but we do believe this was a targeted attack, and that there is no wider risk to people living in the area. \n“We know that Moss Side is a very tight knit community so it is possible that somebody may hold key information about those responsible.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:30:30.809+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
