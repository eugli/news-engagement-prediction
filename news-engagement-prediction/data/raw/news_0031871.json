Photo: Cameron Spencer \nThe bleaching drew international attention to the health of the reef and also stoked opposition to development plans for the state including the potentially massive coal mines of the Galilee Basin. \nBurning the coal produced in the mines would not only add to global warming but also trigger a huge increase in shipping activity, opponents say. The mines have the backing of the state and federal governments which claim thousands of jobs will be generated and the coal will help ease poverty in places such as India. \nThe prospect of more bleaching, though, may reignite those debates. According to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, eastern Australia waters are unusually warm, adding to the risk of bleaching. (See NOAA chart below showing warning alerts and areas that are most at risk.) \nCurrent readings suggest waters are only moderately warmer than average along the Queensland coastline, with temperatures about one degree warmer than usual. (See Weatherzone chart below, based on NOAA data.) \nAndrew Baird, a reef ecologist also at the James Cook University centre in Townsville, said that while research on corals' ability to recover from an event like last year's, it was reasonable to assume some species would be susceptible if temperatures rose again so soon to dangerous thresholds. \n\"It can take two years for egg quality and fecundity [of corals] to recover,\" Professor Baird said. \nWhile cyclones may bring relief in coming months, recent air and sea temperatures have been abnormally warm. Townsville, for instance, was \"baking\" in 37-degree heat on Tuesday, he said. That reading is about six degrees above average for February, according to Bureau of Meteorology data. \nThe bureau's own forecasts point to a couple of more months of warmer-than-usual waters. (See chart below showing predicted temperature anomalies for coming months, in degrees.) Sydney and NSW \nWhile the Great Barrier Reef's corals will draw much of the attention if bleaching returns, reefs off NSW coast or even in Sydney Harbour may face a more immediate threat. \nProfessor Baird noted that hotspots in terms of water temperature anomalies were greater than Queensland, potentially affecting the harbour's corals - which suffered their first recorded bleaching last year. \nSea temperatures off Sydney have touched 26 degrees in recent days, according to the Beachwatch website. The city is also in the midst of what's increasingly likely to be its hottest summer on record, and NSW broke its record average state-wide maximum temperature two days in a row . \nWeatherzone's chart below, also based on NOAA data, indicates temperatures are more than 3 degrees warmer than average off parts of the NSW south coast. \nAlso at risk were corals near Lord Howe Island, where some rare species could face particular threat, said Professor Baird, who has recently been documenting another new species there. \n\"If the bleaching at Lord Howe Island is bad, we'll see extinctions,\" he said.
