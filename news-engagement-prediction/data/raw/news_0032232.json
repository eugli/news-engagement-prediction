I run a business entity near here and I wonder why they moved the toll station to this place,” said one of the petitioners. \nOther petitioners claimed the money is being pocketed by a top politician. \nKenya Airports Authority said the road was built and maintained by the authority. \n“With regard to the issue raised online alleging land grabbing at Wilson Airport; we would like to clarify that the road in question is within Kenya Airports Authority land. The road was built by KAA and is maintained by the Authority,” said a statement from KAA. \nThe statement said KAA can’t comment further on the matter, as issues around it are pending hearing and determination by the court.
