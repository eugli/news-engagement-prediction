Other issues include high use of restraints in some homes and a call to increase baths to more than once a week.\nOpposition calls for release of reports into long-term care homes CEOs tour Sask. long-term care facilities; problems persist Speaking to reporters, Health Minister Jim Reiter said long-term care homes continue to be a priority for the province. Since 2014, $3 million per year has been allocated to improving issues in homes.\nWhile Premier Brad Wall has repeatedly said every government program is on the table when it comes to cuts to balance the budget this year, Reiter said long-term care homes will likely escape the chopping block.\n\"While no final decisions have been made yet on the budget, we recognize the importance of long-term care,\" he said. \"It's going to remain a priority.\"\nHe expects the annual visits to continue after health regions are amalgamated later this year.\n\"We just think these are extremely valuable,\" he said. \"They're valuable not only to be transparent to the public, but they're valuable for decision makers and government.\"\nIn November, the opposition NDP called for the reports to be released to the public. They were originally due in September 2016, but Reiter said the ministry was still waiting for at least one health region's report.\nMajor problems have been highlighted in the past, such as a lack of baths to residents being told to soil themselves when staff cannot help them to the bathroom on time.\nThe reports also list initiatives that are working well, along with proposed actions to stop the problem areas.\nIn 2013, the province created a $10-million fund to identify urgent issues stemming from the CEO tours of long-term care facilities. There is just over $300,000 left in the fund today.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T20:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:37:19.535+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
