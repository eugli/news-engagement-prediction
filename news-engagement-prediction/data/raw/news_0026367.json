At times along the trek the altitude makes me dizzy. Walkers ahead disappear into the cloud that forms a constant backdrop. It feels as if we are walking in the sky, so high up we can almost touch it. Llamas graze on the terraces and I add their strange cry, something between a squawk and a bray, to my library of sounds. When we reach the summit and look down on the 15th-century Inca citadel we feel triumphant. My sense of smell is finely attuned because it used to help me recognise people before I could hear or see them (with no peripheral vision I can only see directly in front of me), and here in the Andes it is the scent of pine forests that linger, and the sounds of nature that stay with me. A day of echoes and A magical pyramid I stand in front of the huge stepped pyramid that overshadows these ancient Mayan ruins, marvelling at the ingenuity of the mathematicians who built it more than 1,000 years ago. It is designed with such geometric precision that during the spring and autumn equinoxes, shadows mimic the descent of a serpent down its northern side. The heat is sweltering. I watch an iguana scuttle past. It looks as prehistoric as its habitat. A musty scent of history, strong, pungent and damp, dominates, and when our guide talks I hear a new echo. It’s different from the one that bounces across the walls in the Newcastle Metro. This is a big, ricocheting outdoor echo that I log in my sound archive. Joanne was reduced to tears in 2014 when doctors at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham turned on her hearing aids for the first time At night, before I drift into deep, soundless sleep, I take my implants out and think about the new sounds I’ve heard today. Learning them involves intense concentration. I used to feel guilty about admitting to sensory overload. These days I don’t. If I need a rest from the hubbub I tune out and retreat again into my world of silence for a while. enjoying the babble of new languages Our bus climbs the ever-narrowing road to the summit of Corcovado mountain, where the giant 30-metre statue of Christ stands, arms outstretched, 700 metres above the sprawling mass of Rio. Having only just become familiar with the sound of spoken English, it is strange and intriguing to hear the excitable rhythms of Portuguese. And here, on the mountain top, tourists from all over the world babble in a dozen alien languages. I scale steps and escalators until the statue of Christ is right in the centre of my field of vision. What I see in the narrow viewfinder of my diminishing sight is acute and in sharp focus, and I’m convinced I’m more observant than those who take their sight for granted. On Christ’s chest I notice a heart. I’m not religious, but I say a little prayer of thanks that I’m here, looking at this miracle of sculptural engineering. I simply ask for strength to face whatever lies ahead. Teeming streets and colourful Saris So as I return from one round of adventures, I’m moving from my home in Newcastle to Durham to live with my fiancé and embark on another adventure — this time a lifelong one After my implants were fitted, I went to Bangladesh to see my childhood friend Amina Khan and fulfil a promise we’d shared as 11-year-olds to help the deaf children of her native country. Amina and I were at school together in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear. We were drawn to each other by our shared sense of being different. I was set apart by my deafness, Amina because she was the only Asian girl in our school. My mission was to take hearing aids to transform the lives of 500 hearing-impaired Bangladeshi children, and Amina — who’d returned to her homeland when she was 16 — was there to meet me. So when I go to neighbouring India, I’m prepared for the explosion of colours, sounds and smells: exhaust fumes, honking horns, every vehicle imaginable on its roads. I’m ready for the hustle-bustle of its cities, the crowds and confusion, the proximity of wealth and poverty, of chaos and calm. What strikes me about the Taj Mahal, though, is its breathtaking serenity. It is a perfectly symmetrical ivory marble mausoleum, but as I get close to it, I realise it is inscribed with a delicate pattern of flowers. I visit with Alana, 36, the younger of my two sisters, and there is so much to store in my mental compendium of sights and sounds: sitar music, the fragrant scent of curries, the parched, arid countryside, teeming streets and colourful saris. Ice chinking and gurgling fountains The Trevi Fountain is frozen when my elder sister Julie, 46, and I arrive in Rome, and as a thin winter sun warms the ice I am amazed by the trickle of water as it thaws. I had not known, in my silent world, that water could be so noisy, that it gurgled as it flowed down plugholes, that it roared down waterfalls, or that ice chinked in glasses. In Rome, animated chatter drifts from trattorias with the smell of garlic and cigar smoke. I stand in front of the Colosseum thinking about the gladiatorial contests, dramas, animal hunts and even executions that took place there and now I can even imagine the shouts and applause of the crowd. My blonde hair was a real novelty The time I am spending with my mum in China is precious, as life is so busy we don’t see enough of each other. In Beijing, my blonde hair makes me a novelty and locals stop to take selfies with me. I love the sound of their giggles. As we walk along the Great Wall on a cold, bright day, we reflect on my life, laughing and crying by turns. Mum, 72, who worked in an office while she raised her three daughters, and my dad Al, 74, a retired cable contractor, never made me feel marginalised by my deafness. Mum fought for me to go to mainstream school. She was there with a hug and consolation when bullies spat on my back on the school bus, knowing I couldn’t hear them. She strides in step with me, holding my arm as we walk a tiny portion of this 5,500-mile wall, and I reflect that I owe my independence and resilience to her determination that my life should be as rich and diverse as her other daughters. Shadows may be closing in around me, but now I have another new sense to compensate for my diminishing sight. I am also blessed with safety, security and a happy home. But most cherished of all is the love of my family and friends that envelops me.
