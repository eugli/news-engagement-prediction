It’s just another example of this town’s inability, it seems, to plow their own streets.” Story continues below \nDistrict of Mission Mayor Randy Hawes told Global News the handicapped stall in question is on 1st Avenue, which is also Highway 7, and as such, was plowed by the Ministry of Transportation subcontractor, and not the District of Mission. \nHawes says there are parking spots all over 1st Avenue that are covered with snow mounds because of how the plow side-casts the snow. \n“Parking was not considered a priority when snow was coming down in almost unprecedented volumes as it was,” he said. “Making major roads passable was the priority. Removing the snow piles will begin as we get on top of our road structure.” \nREAD MORE: Winter storm watch issued for Metro Vancouver, Fraser Valley \nBuchanan says he has been a resident of Squamish for decades. He says his home town and Mission face similar challenges. \n“In Squamish, they plow all the snow, gather it in the centre of the town, come in with a front-end loader and a dump truck and actually remove it. This is a busy commerce area. So not only are they filling up a handicapped spot with snow, they are impacting local businesses.” \nThere is no weather station in Mission, so no official snowfall numbers are available, but unofficial reports suggest roughly 75 cm of snow fell in the Mission area between Friday morning and Monday night. \nHawes says they have had a fair share of complaints about the snow from “unreasonable social media trolls.” \n“Their lack of patience and understanding that this has been a highly unusual situation has been very frustrating,” Hawes said. “Happily the vast majority of our citizens understand and appreciate the huge effort and incredibly long hours put in by our staff to keep our roads passable and safe.” \nMichael Boronowski, the City’s Manager of Civic Engagement & Corporate Initiatives, also said there is a parking spot designated for people with disabilities, where crews have had to leave snow piled, but the others remain open. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T02:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:20:03.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
