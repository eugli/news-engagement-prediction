Which is why when Vice President Mike Pence made a stop in H-Town ahead of the Super Bowl, many Houstonians were a little disappointed with his choice in smoked meats. A post to Pence’s official Vice President Twitter account announced that he hit Pappas Bros. Bar-B-Q before heading to NRG Stadium to take in the Super Bowl , dining on what he called some “great Texas barbecue.” The tweet doesn’t specify exactly what Pence and his crew ordered at the restaurant, but scope out this photo of the VP greeting restaurant employees at what he calls “Pappa’s.” Anyone who knows the Pence family knows we can't pass up good BBQ. Had to stop by Pappa's in Houston on the way to Super Bowl LI. pic.twitter.com/P0tjYp4A7V — Vice President Pence (@VP) February 5, 2017 Considering the bevy of newer, arguably better barbecue joints in Houston , many folks on Twitter weren’t too impressed with Pence’s pick. Check out this small sampling of less-than-positive feedback from local barbecue enthusiasts, including a jab from beloved ice cream spot Froeschl’s: If pence thinks Pappas Barbecue is good barbecue, Pence doesn't know shit about barbecue... https://t.co/pekdL0pnUM — Eric J. Ochoa (@EricOchoa92) February 6, 2017 Mike Pence going to Pappas to get good BBQ is like going to McDonalds for a good hamburger. C/o @recer12 — Anna Saikin (@AnnaSaikin) February 6, 2017 Hey @mike_pence ..Pappas BBQ for #pulledpork is the most UNTEXAN thing you can do!! #getaclue — Froeschl's Ice Cream (@froeschls) February 5, 2017 Pence comes to Houston and eats at Papa's BBQ. pic.twitter.com/PSpMMVWnaq — Cristina Flores (@cflo_21) February 5, 2017 @anathymadevice Pappa's is overpriced chain bullshit. Real Texans know better. Get Pence the fuck out of my state! #FuckPence #FuckTrump Ouch. Perhaps next time Pence heads to Houston, he’ll make better choices.
