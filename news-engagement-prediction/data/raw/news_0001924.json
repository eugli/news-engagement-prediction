Senate PRIB, File \nMANILA, Philippines — Anti-graft court Sandiganbayan issued a hold departure order against dismissed Philippine National Police (PNP) chief Alan Purisima and former Special Action Force (SAF) director Getulio Napeñas in connection to the Mamasapano case. \nPurisima and Napeñas are facing charges of usurpation of public functions and graft. \nThe Fourth Division of the Sandiganbayan directed the Bureau of Immigration to prohibit the two accused from leaving the country for any destination abroad. \nThe two police officers involved in the Mamasapano clash may only leave the country if they have written permission secured and granted by the court. \nPreliminary investigation of the Office of the Ombudsman showed that Purisima and Napeñas coordinated a top level meeting with military officers for the Mamasapano operation, dubbed as Oplan Exodus. \nPurisima was then under preventive suspension stemming from his graft case over an anomalous courier deal of the PNP. Headlines   \nThe former PNP chief ordered the SAF to conceptualize the operation to arrest Malaysian terrorist Zulkifli bin Hir, alias Marwan, in Mamasapano, Maguindanao on Jan . 25, 2015. He also ordered Napeñas to brief then President Benigno Aquino III about the operation. \nMembers of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters attacked the SAF commandos after killing Marwan. \nThis encounter led to the death of 64 Filipinos, including 44 SAF troopers.
