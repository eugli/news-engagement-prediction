I’m a great fan of CNN; I watch it quite faithfully, every day CNN is slamming him, slamming him, slamming him. Every day, they’re looking for a scandal. They’re just turning the woods upside down looking for a scandal. They’re hoping, I think, to do to him what they did to Nixon a long time ago. And, you know, still haven’t found any real scandals,” Stein stated.\nHe continued, “With all due respect, I don’t blame him for being furious at them. And I think he’s got a lot of company. I’m out there giving speeches all around the country all the time, an awful lot of people are not great fans of the media, and they see the media as an unelected aristocracy … who are dumping all over the mainstream of America.”\n(h/t RCP Video )\n Ben Stein , CNN , Donald Trump , Richard Nixon , The New York Times", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MagnifiTrent", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/twitter/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fvideo%2F2017%2F02%2F26%2Fben-stein-media-looking-for-a-scandal-every-day-with-trump-to-do-to-him-what-they-did-to-nixon%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Ben+Stein%3A+Media+%E2%80%98Looking+for+a+Scandal%E2%80%99+Every+Day+with+Trump+to+Do+to+Him+What+They+Did+to+Nixon&shortener=bitly", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/facebook/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fvideo%2F2017%2F02%2F26%2Fben-stein-media-looking-for-a-scandal-every-day-with-trump-to-do-to-him-what-they-did-to-nixon%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Ben+Stein%3A+Media+%E2%80%98Looking+for+a+Scandal%E2%80%99+Every+Day+with+Trump+to+Do+to+Him+What+They+Did+to+Nixon", "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/02/26/ben_stein_media_searching_for_a_scandal_hoping_to_do_to_trump_what_they_did_to_nixon.html", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/google_plusone_share/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fvideo%2F2017%2F02%2F26%2Fben-stein-media-looking-for-a-scandal-every-day-with-trump-to-do-to-him-what-they-did-to-nixon%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Ben+Stein%3A+Media+%E2%80%98Looking+for+a+Scandal%E2%80%99+Every+Day+with+Trump+to+Do+to+Him+What+They+Did+to+Nixon"], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T05:05:23.529+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
