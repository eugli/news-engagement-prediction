A unanimous judicial decision has for the moment, denied the president’s Executive Order for a 120 day travel ban on immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries and an indefinite ban on Syrian refugees.\nThe attempt to implement the order caused chaos and confusion on both sides of the border. As protests to the ban grew, so did the genuine anger of many Canadian and American lawyers, who rushed to airports to help those who were turned away. Simultaneously, Canada saw a surge in asylum seekers from the U.S. as small border towns struggled with an expanding community.\nIn spite of warnings in Trump’s campaign rhetoric, the shift in American refugee policy was stunning. The Statue of Liberty’s light, long a beacon of welcome to “huddled masses yearning to breathe free,” seemed to dim, evoking long ago memories of prejudice and bias. \nIn 1939, the beleaguered German ship the MS St. Louis, primarily full of Jewish passengers, was turned away, first by Cuba, then the United States and Canada. This type of discrimination was never to happen again as cherished legal principles, including the rule of law — the belief that all people are equal before the law — gained prominence over the years. Yet, suddenly, our legal history seemed in peril.\n  If this wasn’t bad enough, the real time legal drama, which included the Apprentice -like firing of the acting Attorney General, had more twists and turns than the television series, Law and Order . Invoking national security concerns, the poorly considered order asserted the power of the executive branch yet failed to understand that the separation of powers requires symmetry for efficient and wise enforcement of public policy. While all three branches of government (executive, judiciary and legislative) are independent of each other, they are in fact, dependent on each other for execution.\nTo make matters worse, judicial independence was also at risk after Trump’s astonishing Twitter attack on Judge James Robart, the justice, who issued the initial temporary restraining order on the ban. Even the president’s choice for the crucially important Supreme Court vacancy, Neil Gorsuch, felt compelled to state that although he was not referring to Trump “he finds any criticism of a judge’s integrity and independence disheartening and demoralizing.”\n(Canada has not been immune from this kind of attitude toward the judiciary. In 2014, then-PM Stephen Harper attacked Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin, as she tried to quietly warn the government that their choice of Marc Nadon for the Supreme Court was ineligible. She was proven to be right.)\nHowever, there is a silver lining. While the two leaders may have to be politically silent on these thorny issues, others will not be so reticent. The sleeping giant of law, as a watchdog on extreme political authority in a democracy, is now fully awake and alert.\nColumbia Law Human Rights Organizations have launched an online tool called the Trump Human Rights Tracker, which records and summarizes the human rights affected or violated by each of the president’s orders. It is already chilling reading.\nAnd just this week, our government announced the reinstatement of the Court Challenges Program, which provides financial assistance to those who wish to launch a Charter challenge. A particular emphasis will be placed on litigation, one of the biggest roadblocks to mounting such a case.\nAs well, law professor Jennifer Bond, faculty director of the Refugee Hub University of Ottawa and the spark behind the Refugee Sponsorship Support Program, notes the increased activism throughout the legal community, including the amazing support of law students.\n“Our students are critical partners in all aspects of this effort — both because we need their valuable contributions today and because we need them to learn the importance of this kind of work so that they are leading it tomorrow.”\nA line in Shakespeare’s play, Henry VI, jokes that, “The first thing we do, let’s kill all the lawyers.” Little did Shakespeare know that Donald Trump would emerge later in the world’s history. Instead of killing all the lawyers, he has given them, and the law, new life. \nYes, see you in court, Mr. President.\nPenny Collenette is an adjunct professor of law at the University of Ottawa and was a senior director of the Prime Minister’s Office for Jean Chrétien.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T15:41:36.173+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
