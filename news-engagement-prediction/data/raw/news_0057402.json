The SurveyUSA poll tested 35 different politicians and found that McCain had a uniquely strong appeal to the opposing party. And the poll was conducted last week, before McCain's most biting comments about Trump and his decision to compare Trump's attacks on the press to what a dictator does .\nWhile Democrats said 54 percent to 28 percent that McCain puts his country first rather than himself — and the split is the same for independents — Republicans said McCain puts America first by a smaller, 44-35 margin.\n\n\n\nAmong Republicans, that puts McCain behind well-known figures such as House Speaker Paul Ryan (53-25), Rudy Giuliani (57-16) and Mike Pence (79-9), who are viewed as more likely to make principled decisions. McCain's numbers among Republicans are even more remarkable when you consider that he's a war hero who spent years as a prisoner of war. Despite this, Republicans are still pretty evenly split on whether he puts his country first.\nAmong Democrats, no Republican scored higher on putting his country first. Even Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), another top Trump critic, was in negative territory among Democrats, with 23 percent saying he puts his country first and 31 percent saying he puts his own interests first.\nAnd in fact, McCain is viewed as principled by more Democrats than any politician tested apart from Bernie Sanders (77-12) and Elizabeth Warren (55-12). Hillary Clinton was not tested, and most other Democrats tested weren't so well-known nationally.\nMcCain has clearly made a decision to be the most vocal of the Trump critics in the Republican Party today. His speech in Munich, Germany, on Friday was a barnburner (without mentioning Trump directly), and then he doubled down over the weekend.\nSen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) has repeatedly come under attack from President Trump. Here are just a few of their rocky moments. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) That's a posture that's going to earn him plaudits from the opposition — as has occasionally been the case in his political career. But it's worth noting that he's still a suspect figure for many Republicans. And it's not clear that by speaking out against Trump, McCain will be persuading many Republicans to share his skepticism of the president.\nAs I've written before, the GOP is still about as united behind Trump as every president's base has been at this stage of the game.\n\nAnd comparing McCain's numbers to Giuliani's is instructive. There has not been a more unapologetic Trump supporter than Giuliani. That's how he has come to define himself these days. And he's got very good numbers among Republicans — much better than McCain's.\nRunning afoul of your party's president is a great strategy for making news, but it's also a recipe for marginalizing yourself among your own party, which is somewhat familiar to McCain.\nMcCain has a platform as a longtime senator and former GOP presidential nominee, but when it comes to converting Republicans who are thus far standing behind Trump, he's not the greatest messenger.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:32:54.933+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
