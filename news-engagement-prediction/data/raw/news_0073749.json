The men had their hands bound and their eyes blindfolded. They were taken to the sinkhole and shot in the back of the head,” 40-year-old local villager Mahmoud told The Daily Telegraph. \nThe terrorist killers were masked, the witness added. \nEarlier this week, the Telegraph reportedly went to the Khasfa sinkhole following the recapture of the western half of Mosul by Iraqi troops. \nThe city has been under IS control since 2014, and the offensive to retake it began in October. \nOn Friday, Iraqi forces seized the city’s airport. \nOver the past years, IS is believed to have conducted a campaign to hunt down and murder policemen and soldiers and toss them into mass graves in the desert. \nHuman Rights Watch reported last November that IS had executed at least 300 policemen and buried them in a mass grave some 30 kilometers from Mosul. \nAnother mass grave containing 100 beheaded bodies was found earlier that month in a school just outside of Mosul.
