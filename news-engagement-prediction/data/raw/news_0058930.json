Rosa Parks was arrested, and this arrest triggered the Montgomery bus boycott and ignited the American civil rights movement. Selected Rosa Parks Quotations I believe we are here on the planet Earth to live, grow up and do what we can to make this world a better place for all people to enjoy freedom. I would like to be known as a person who is concerned about freedom and equality and justice and prosperity for all people. The only tired I was, was tired of giving in. (on refusing to give up her seat on the bus to a white male) I'm tired of being treated like a second-class citizen. People always say that I didn't give up my seat because I was tired, but that isn't true. I was not tired physically, or no more tired than I usually was at the end of a working day. I was not old, although some people have an image of me as being old then. I was forty-two.

Our mistreatment was just not right, and I was tired of it. I didn't want to pay my fare and then go around the back door, because many times, even if you did that, you might not get on the bus at all. They'd probably shut the door, drive off, and leave you standing there. My only concern was to get home after a hard day's work. Arrest me for sitting on a bus? You may do that. At the time I was arrested I had no idea it would turn into this. It was just a day like any other day. The only thing that made it significant was that the masses of the people joined in. I am a symbol. Each person must live their life as a model for others. I have learned over the years that when one's mind is made up, this diminishes fear; knowing what must be done does away with fear.

[F]rom the time I was a child, I tried to protest against disrespectful treatment. Memories of our lives, of our works and our deeds will continue in others. God has always given me the strength to say what is right. Racism is still with us. But it is up to us to prepare our children for what they have to meet, and, hopefully, we shall overcome. I do the very best I can to look upon life with optimism and hope and looking forward to a better day, but I don't think there is anything such as complete happiness. It pains me that there is still a lot of Klan activity and racism. I think when you say you're happy, you have everything that you need and everything that you want, and nothing more to wish for. I haven't reached that stage yet.
