She said: ‘Ronald Reagan started to have a decline in the number of unique words with repetitions of statements over time, whereas George W Bush didn’t. ‘Ronald Reagan started using more fillers, more empty phrases like ‘thing’, ‘something’, ‘basically’, ‘actually’ or ‘well’ – more empty words in his speech.’ US President Ronald Reagan, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s six years after leaving office, and Dame Iris Murdoch, who was also diagnosed with Alzheimer’s Similar studies on the works of writers Agatha Christie, who is suspected to have had Alzheimer’s, and Iris Murdoch, who was diagnosed with it, found the vocabulary in her later books became less varied. To see if people on the verge of getting Alzheimer’s were showing detectable differences compared with healthy people, the researchers devised a simple task. They gave individuals three words – for example, ‘stove, water and pot’ – and asked them to create a sentence with these words. The study looked at 22 healthy individuals, 24 healthy older individuals and 22 suffering from mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Dr Sherman said there was a ‘significant difference’ between the healthy groups and the one with cognitive impairment, adding: ‘Their speech was very different, they were much less concise in conveying information, the sentences were much longer and they were more roundabout in getting their point across. ‘MCIs tended to get lost along the way and had more difficulty connecting and remembering the three words. ‘We are hoping we might be able to develop this into a test to detect early changes that are predictive of Alzheimer’s disease.’ She added: ‘Many individuals may be long-winded, that’s not a concern. You need to be concerned if there is a change in your ability to communicate effectively.’ Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T08:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T03:54:58.654+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
