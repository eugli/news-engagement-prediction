Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (INQUIRER FILE PHOTO / LYN RILLON) \nFormer President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo is still a deputy speaker of the House of Representatives, at least for the time being. \nSpeaker Pantaleon Alvarez on Thursday sought to correct the misimpression that he had ordered the replacement of the Pampanga representative as a House leader for opposing the revival of the death penalty. \n“No, not yet, because we have not yet voted in plenary [session],” Alvarez said when asked if Arroyo had been removed from her post. ADVERTISEMENT \nHe had earlier warned deputy speakers and committee chairs of the 293-seat chamber that they risked being replaced if they planned to vote against the proposed law restoring the capital punishment for heinous offenses, one of the top legislative priorities of the Duterte administration. \nAlvarez said the deputy speakers and committee chairs stood to lose their posts only once they had voted against the measure on the plenary floor. \nAlvarez also dismissed insinuations that he was targeting Arroyo because she was rumored to be interested in the speakership. Text messages that Arroyo would replace Alvarez as he was poised to join Mr. Duterte’s Cabinet circulated late last year, but both camps denied it. \nArroyo has kept mum on the controversy and reporters’ requests for an interview were turned down on Wednesday. \nOf the 14 deputy speakers in the House, Arroyo and Camarines Sur Rep. Rolando Andaya have voiced opposition to the bill. Members of the Makabayan bloc, three of whom have committee chairmanships, are also opposing the bill. \nGabriela Rep. Emmi de Jesus, chair of the poverty alleviation committee, said she was prepared to lose her chairmanship, rather than succumb to “patronage politics.” \nThe 1987 Constitution abolished the death penalty with the caveat that it may be reimposed for heinous crimes through a law passed in Congress. \nIt was restored under former President Fidel V. Ramos’ administration, while executions started under Joseph Estrada’s. Arroyo then issued a ban on executions, and a law was later passed in 2006 ending the death penalty.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T03:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:59:42.749+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
