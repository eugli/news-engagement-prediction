The religious controversy is the second this year to focus on the reciting of a Muslim prayer, after one of the Queen’s chaplains criticised Glasgow’s St Mary’s Episcopal Cathedral for marking the epiphany with a reading from the Qur’an.\nBoth Haines and organisers at the 11th-century Gloucester Cathedral, the resting place of Edward II, intended the Faith art show to highlight Gloucester’s identity as a contented multicultural community. “The cathedral agreed to put it on because I wanted to celebrate this city,” said Haines. “Gloucester is often thought not to be such a great place, as the poorer neighbour of Cheltenham. But the one thing we have is a hugely diverse community and no conflict. We were the place with the first woman bishop and other major positions in the church here are held by women.”\nHaines’s exhibition includes filmed interviews with the subjects of his portraits, each drawn from a variety of faiths, including Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, Jews and Christians. There is even a witch. The interviews are played on screens around the cathedral’s vaulted cloisters and Chapter House. “I have no proof,” said Haines. “But it is strange that of the four films we made, the ones that were taken were the two with a lot of Islamic content. I can’t prove it, but I know there are a lot of people who don’t like it. It is pure Islamophobia and racism at work. I have had threats, but most have been against the local vicar who helped me, Ruth Fitter. She has had some dreadful things sent to her.”\nAt the exhibition’s launch, traditional dishes from around the world were served to more than 1,000 visitors. Imam Hassan from Gloucester’s Masjid-e-Noor mosque sang the Muslim call to prayer and a Jewish prayer was said, while a white witch spoke on behalf of minority faiths. “It was a big event around here and it was wonderfully surreal. Then about two days afterwards, all the fuss started,” said Haines. “ It wasn’t handled very well, I think the cathedral would now agree. They decided not to say anything and just took everything offline.” \nSince then, Haines’s provocative portrait of Jesus with a raised finger has been vandalised and items, including memory cards and a sound system worth £1,500, have gone missing. “Most of those on the doors are volunteers, and it has been extremely crowded. It may have been an opportunist crime, but I have a suspicion that some of it is related to the content of my show.”\nHaines came to portrait painting late in life after recovering from a severe stroke, aged 44. In response to the backlash, he is now making a fourth work to add to a triptych already on display. “Russ won’t take commissions. He is hugely talented and only wants to take on projects that interest him, which normally means having some social impact, often through challenging concepts,” said James Garrod, the artist’s exhibition manager . “He started this project because he wanted to understand people’s faith. Using his portraits to do this is his way of repaying the community for the help he got from art therapy when he needed it.”\nHaines said his paintings are starting to sell well. “It was thinking about my art, and about the idea that it was now all I needed, that made me realise faith is quite a similar thing. I did this show to find out more about the people around me in this city.”\nThe Very Rev Stephen Lake, dean of Gloucester, said the show gives a glimpse into the individual stories of people of faith. “We are proud to be holding the exhibition and would encourage everyone to visit to learn more about people of different faiths,” he has said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T02:36:15.947+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
