(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson) \nOf course it didn't work. \nWe kept trying to sell ourselves on it – wedging a round puck into a square – that a swansong coach thinking Cup could lead a new roster to winning one, all while his replacement loomed daily. \nKen Hitchcock has been fired by the Blues – Mike Yeo takes over – because the Blues and general manager Doug Armstrong got themselves into a pick-your-poison situation: Fire Hitch midseason and hope this doesn't stain the clean-start Yeo was promised … or keep Hitch and watch this team fade away. \nA transition team can still make the playoffs. \nBut the way it's been going, this team was trending toward the longest summer it's had in years. \nYou watch this team and the play is infuriating. Mental lapses. Defensive holes. Goalie issues. But the boys could always hang their helmets on winning at home. Well, the Blues have lost their past four games at home. \nTalk about a harbinger. We saw it the first few weeks of the season. \nI wrote about it then. Something was clearly weird with the St. Louis Blues. They were making numerous penalties – too many men on the ice and delay of game – that implied a lack of discipline. Before the fun run in the 2016 postseason, there were many murmurs about the players tuning out Hitchcock, and here, at the beginning of the 2016-17 season, the team couldn't mesh and the team couldn't score. Even then, and some argued it was premature, I suggested in this newspaper that, at minimum, it was fair to discuss nipping it in the bud and firing Hitch. \nInstead, the team kept him, and the Blues found some success (this roster might not be the Capitals, but it's definitely not the Devils). The Winter Classic, at the time, looked like it would be the great rejuvenation. Hitch was a hoot in his hat, the Blues beat the Hawks, Jake Allen looked sharp and Vladimir Tarasenko was the show-stopper. \nBut overall, it appears it was tougher for the Blues, a team in transition, to have two bosses at the office. \nHitch is gone, and he leaves a strong legacy. I am forever awed by the way he led the team through last postseason. It was inspiring and exciting, and the franchise thought it could build off that. The David Backes and Troy Brouwer moves made some sense, understanding that St. Louis, with the looming cap, would need to sign its young players to long-term deals. And it spearheaded a new style of play – faster, smaller, peskier. Well, the problem was, the roster didn't pan out for this style. And Hitch was stuck trying to coach his old style, trying to salvage that, with old and new players. \nDefinitely, Hitch is a legend. And years from now, we'll all be in Toronto, interviewing Hitch when he's enshrined into the Hall of Fame. We'll talk about the good times, the '16 playoffs, and all the regular-season success in the previous seasons, too. \nBut for now, the story is this season, and even with the most unforgettable site in team history, The Winter Classic, the season has been a forgettable one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T21:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:15:19.108+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
