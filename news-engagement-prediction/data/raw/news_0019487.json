Those messages get deleted straight away!” \nWe meet at Nottingham’s Lacemarket Hotel, near to where Caroline works as a men’s stylist. \nShe cuts a breathtaking figure and my eyes instinctively go to her feet, expecting killer heels. \nInstead I see stylish black boots – with flat soles.

It makes it hard to dress for a date. Most guys ­expect high heels on a first date.” \nAs we head to our table, an undeniably short waiter has to stretch to take her coat. \nBetween forkfuls, she says her height is caused by genetic condition marfan syndrome, which hits the body’s connective tissues. \nIt can also cause heart issues, so she has regular checks. \nCaroline takes the physical effects in her stride but the psychological impact of being bullied at school hit her hard. Caroline says she is looking for a basketball player (Photo: Roland Leon/Sunday Mirror) \nShe was branded “giraffe legs” and boys would pretend to ask her out, only to mock her in front of their friends. \nThings reached a head when one girl called Caroline “lanky” online and told her to commit suicide. Her parents took her out of school to teach her at home. \n“That had a lasting impact,” she says. “People are nicer now. But you still get idiots who shout. I hate it, not because of what they say but as it makes people look. It makes me more self-conscious. \n“I tend to be suspicious when a man asks me out. I worry they’re doing it to make fun, like the bullies at school.” Warren wished Caroline luck in finding a man to measure up to her expectations (Photo: Roland Leon/Sunday Mirror) \nFor now, Caroline is focused on her career and her brand of plus-sized shoes, which she sells online through Carobella Boutique. \nShe set it up as she could never find stylish options in size 11. \nOn Tuesday night, she will be packing orders. But she insists she is keen to find love – so what is she looking for? \n“I’m hoping I’ll meet a nice, eligible basketball player,” she laughs. “I actually don’t care about a guy’s height. I just worry with someone much shorter, it will become an issue for them. I’d like to find a man who doesn’t even mention my height, who likes me for me.” \nOutside, we hug and say goodbye. This time, I don’t feel the need to stand on tiptoe. I wish Caroline good luck in her search for love. There must be some fella out there who’ll measure up. \nfeedback@people.co.uk ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T02:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T21:29:27.481+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
