Kohli introduced Ashwin much later than expected. \nBut bowling his first over of the day, Ashwin got a major breakthrough when he dismissed Bangladeshi skipper Mushfiqur Rahim, who had hit a fighting ton in the first innings. \nUsually very calm and composed, Ashwin gave a send-off to the wicketkeeper batsman when he perished while trying to hit a big shot. \nWatch the dismissal and Ashwin's send-off here: \nAshwin picked six wickets in the Test, as India extended their unbeaten run to 19 matches in the five-day format. \nIndia will now take on Australia in a four-match series beginning from February 23.
