Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nBorn with a rare bone disorder, Erick John Rwabirire was aged just three when he developed an enormous tumour on his face. \nGrowing up, he was laughed at by other kids, suffered horrific pain and had to quit school as the tumour continued to expand. \nBefore long, he was having to sleep with his finger in the corner of his mouth, propped up at an angle, to allow air to get into his lungs. \nCrying over his condition every night, the youngster believed he would die at any time, never allowing himself to think about the future. \nBut aged 17, he was given a chance for survival - a 24-hour operation to rebuild his face by medics at London's Chelsea & Westminster hospital . \nBy then, the 2.5kg tumour had invaded most of the right-hand-side of Erick's face, leaving him unable to eat, drink or breathe normally. Aged 17, Erick was given the chance to undergo a 24-hour, high-risk operation to rebuild his face in London (Photo: Channel 5) Read More How six fit young men were left disfigured and fighting for lives after 'Elephant Man' drugs trial \nIt was also giving off a foul, rotting smell. \nErick was given a 50 per cent chance of dying on the operating table, according to a new Channel 5 documentary, The Boy With No Face: 6 Months On. \nTravelling from his home in Uganda to the airport last year, the teenager suffered a number of health scares, sparking fears he would die. \nHowever, he managed to make the journey to Britain, where he was due to be operated on by top plastic surgeons Simon Eccles and Niall Kirkpatrick. \nAppearing the documentary, Erick bravely says ahead of his surgery: \"I am told I may die or survive, but I don't know what it will be like.\" \nThe programme follows the young man as he is wheeled into the operating theatre, as his devoted guardian anxiously waits outside. \nHis father, who cannot speak any English, agreed to make Brian Kasozi his guardian ahead of his potentially life-changing trip to the UK. Erick was given a 50 per cent chance of dying on the operating table during surgery (Photo: Channel 5) Read More \nOnce in the theatre, Erick's tumour is chopped off by the surgeons, before they begin to reassemble his face, piece by piece. \nTwelve hours in, they have made good progress. However, as time passes, the anaesthetist becomes increasingly concerned. \nMedics had hoped to carry out the removal of the tumour and the reconstruction of Erick's face at the same time. In doing so, they would have avoided having to put him under anaesthesia multiple times, the documentary reveals. \nHowever, they are forced to abandon the procedure after the teenager's heart rate becomes erratic and his blood pressure drops. \nAfter being wheeled back out of the theatre, Erick is placed in intensive care, where he sees the changes to his face for the first time. \n\"I asked him about the person who he's seeing right now and he told me he's not seeing the Erick that he was before,\" Brian says. \n\"He's seeing his role model. \n\"He calls himself Bebe Cool - he's a music artist in Uganda.\" Growing up, the teenager was laughed at by other kids because of his tumour (Photo: Channel 5) \nThe guardian reveals that Erick - his 'adopted brother' - has big dreams for the future, having previously expressed his wish to become a singer or footballer. \nBefore long, the teenager is back on the operating table to complete his surgery. \nHowever, the surgeons are shocked to find massive amounts of white tissue that could indicate the tumour has regrown in just a few days. \nAgain, they have to abandon the procedure and send the tissue off for testing. \nFortunately, the tests come back with good news - so Erick once again goes under the knife, with Simon leading the risky operation. \nIncredibly, the surgery - which used new techniques to rebuild the teenager's face in a bid to save his life - appears to be a success. \nErick recovers on the hospital ward, laughing and joking around with nurses and even kicking a football down the corridor. \nHe later returns home to Uganda, where he is met with delight and amazement. \nHowever, tragically, the programme reveals that just weeks after his return, Erick's tumour started to regrow at an alarming rate. He underwent surgery at London's Chelsea and Westminster hospital (file picture) last year (Photo: Googlestreetview) Read More \nIts regrowth left the surgeons in the UK feeling \"incredibly disappointed\". \nUnlike before, the tumour was also found to be malignant. \nSaddened by the news, Brian raised money to get the teenager a house of his own and a nurse to care for him for six months. \nIn the documentary, he can be seen visiting his beloved adopted brother, sitting next to him inside his recently-bought home. \nHeartbreakingly, just four days later, Erick died peacefully in his sleep. \nDespite the best efforts of British surgeons, the loving actions of Brian and the support of his village, he had lost his battle with his tumour. \nThe Channel 5 documentary follows on from a 2016 programme that introduced Erick and told his inspirational and moving story. \nDuring his life, the teenager was helped by the charity Facing the World , which helps provide craniofacial surgery to disadvantaged and vulnerable children. \nNew: The Boy With No Face - 6 Months On: Extraordinary People will air today (Wednesday, February 22) on Channel 5 at 10pm Like us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:19:02.882+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
