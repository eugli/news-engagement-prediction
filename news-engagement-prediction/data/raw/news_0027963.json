Editor Advertisement \nIt has to happen, sooner or later. Singapore authorities are not known for being big on memories and old iconic stuff in the drive for modernisation. So, by July this year, the iconic Sungei Road Thieves Market, which had survived 80 years and World War II, will also be no more. \nThe area instead will be used for future residential developments, what else, and the Sungei Road MRT station. The roads there are to be re-aligned as well. So, in a few years from now, the area will look totally different from its humble beginnings. As for the old peddlers who are still selling their second hand goods there, they will probably be chased away and consigned to history. \nSlowly but surely, the old Singapore is disappearing. Only memories will be left behind. \nOng G N \nA.S.S. Contributor Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
