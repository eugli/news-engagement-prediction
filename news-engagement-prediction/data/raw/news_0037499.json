best five storylines ahead of the 2017 season Sam Worthington, FOX SPORTS February 17, 2017 2:40pm \n1) KARMICHAEL HUNT LOOKS LIKE A RUGBY PLAYER AGAIN \nYou can take or leave the scruffy facial hair but Karmichael Hunt now looks like a rugby player again. \nAs reported by The Courier Mail’s Jim Tucker, Hunt arrived from AFL at 89kg but he has returned to his rugby fighting weight at 97kg and appears to be a in a great space to return to his footballing best. \nMichael Cheika is a big fan of the 30-year-old and Hunt would have been a Wallaby last season if not for a groin injury would turned out to be much worse than first thought. \nOK, it was only a pre-season tune-up, but Hunt looked a million bucks for the Reds at the Brisbane Tens last weekend. \nHis solid frame gave him the ability to absorb contact and make offensive tackles — attributes with which he made his name in the NRL and State of Origin arena. \nHunt is also an excellent ballplayer and will take the pressure off Quade Cooper to do it all on his Pat Malone. \nThrow in new (old) signings George Smith and Stephen Moore and talk of a Reds revival is real. \nThose is Brisbane for Tuesday’s trial game report that the Reds beat up the Rebels in the scrum and contact areas and Brad Thorn will demand excellence in defence. media_camera Hurricanes star Nehe Milner-Skudder in action at the Brisbane Global Rugby Tens at Suncorp Stadium. \n2) NMS IS BACK BUT CAN THE HURRICANES REPEAT? \nSo inspired were the Hurricanes last year, they managed to snap a 20-year title drought without their trump card Nehe Milner-Skudder. \nWorld Rugby’s 2015 breakthrough player of the year, Milner-Skudder had a dream run which culminated scoring the opening try of the 2015 World Cup final. \nBut the sidestepping genius experienced the other side of sport last season when he suffered a season-ending shoulder injury and was forced to watch on from the sideline as Beauden Barrett orchestrated the Canes’ triumph. \nAll eyes were on the 26-year-old as he made his comeback at the Brisbane Tens and after leaving Ayumu Goromaru among others in his wake — Milner-Skudder quite clearly still has ‘it.’ \nIt leaves Hurricanes coach with a wealth of options in his back three as Milner-Skudder vies with Julian Savea, Cory Jane, Jordie Barrett and Ben Lam for a starting spot. \nWinning back-to-back titles is fiendishly difficult but the Hurricanes have a settled squad more than capable of giving it an almighty nudge. media_camera Sam Carter, Michael Hooper, Nic Stirzaker, James Slipper and Tatafu Polota-Nau. \n3) CAN AN AUSTRALIAN TEAM WIN THE TITLE? \nThe Brumbies were Australia’s big hope in 2016 but fluffed their lines and bowed out at home to the Highlanders in the quarterfinals. \nWithout David Pocock, Stephen Moore, Matt Toomua, Joe Tomane, Christian Lealiifano and Tomas Cubelli, only the most optimistic Canberran would dare to dream in 2017. \nThe Force should be scrappy and more competitive under fresh-faced coach Dave Wessels but both they and the Rebels simply don’t have the talent pool to win the Australian conference, let alone the whole thing. \nThat leaves the Waratahs and the Reds. \nNSW were disappointing in Daryl Gibson’s first year in charge, failing to make the finals despite a Wallaby-laden squad. \nMuch will hinge on their emerging players making the step up to consistent Super Rugby performers — think Andrew Kellaway, Jed Holloway, Jack Dempsey, Irae Simone and Tolu Latu. \nBut on pure talent, no-one can match the Reds, who may well be the favourites to take out the all-important Australian conference. \nAs well as a vast injection of experience, the Queenslanders also boast some of the country’s best young talent in Lukhan Tui, Taniela Tupou and Andrew Ready. \nBut a title will be a bridge too far with the Kiwi sides odds-on to dominate again. \n4) WILL AN AUSTRALIAN TEAM GET CULLED? \nThe never-ending soap opera of SANZAAR and its ever-changing Super Rugby format gets another airing next month as the organisation meets to settle on its preferred new structure. \nThe future of the Force and Rebels (perhaps even the Brumbies) is on the line yet again and the Australian Rugby Union board will meet on Monday to nut out its own position. \nWhile culling a team would obviously strengthen the playing stocks of the remaining four clubs, it would sound the death knell to the game in one of Australia’s major cities. \nPlayers Association boss Ross Xenos has been on the front foot. \n“Professional rugby is the economic engine of the game in Australia and we need more local content, not less, generating a larger revenue base to reinvest into premier and community rugby,” Xenos said. \n“The ARU has a vision to ‘inspire all Australians’ but there is nothing inspirational for any of the game’s stakeholders in voluntarily going backwards.” \nWatch this space. Lions coaches Warren Gatland, Rob Howley, Andy Farrell and Steve Borthwick. \n5) WILL LIONS TOUR OVERSHADOW SUPER RUGBY? \nThe Lions’ tour of New Zealand is undoubtedly the centrepiece of the 2017 season. \nThe 10-game, three Test epic will transfix the rugby world as Lions coach Warren Gatland tries to plot the demise of his countrymen. \nLet’s hope it sharpens the focus on Super Rugby, rather than dilutes it. \nWhile All Blacks coach Steve Hansen will have most of his starting XV already pencilled in, Super Rugby form should dictate the makeup of his bench and wider squad. \nWill Aaron Cruden’s departure open the door for Lima Sopoaga to become the No 2 No 10, behind Beauden Barrett? \nHe looked sensational in orchestrating the Highlanders backs in Thursday’s 50-47 trial win over the Waratahs at Brookvale... sorry, Lottloland. \nSimilarly the Six Nations is doubling as an protracted selection stage for English, Irish, Welsh and Scottish players hoping to force their way into Gatland’s notebook.
