People travelling north could turn off at State Highway 27 and follow the signposted detour. \nIt was not known how long the road would be closed. Update: Both SH1 and SH29 are CLOSED. A detour is in place. Motorists are advised to expect delays in the area. ^LC https://t.co/FsePNqD49t pic.twitter.com/NmAJtc12HI â€” NZTA Waikato/BoP (@NZTAWaiBoP) 2 February 2017 \n\nIn the past decade, there have been 13 deaths and 45 serious injuries from crashes on the stretch of road. \nThe Transport Agency had announced that $8.1 million would be spent on improving safety from the Cambridge section of the Waikato Expressway to the SH1/SH29 intersection. \nWaikato highways manager Niclas Johansson said the work would provide immediate safety improvements ahead of a detailed investigation to identify long-term solutions for the 17km section of State Highway 1, including the intersection. \nThe project included creating a wide centreline to reduce head on crashes, installing side barriers in high-risk areas to reduce the impact of run-off road crashes, and upgrading signs to make high risk areas more visible. \nMembrey urged motorists to try and avoid the area and delay any travel for the next few hours. \n\"We are heading into a long weekend - enjoy yourself, take your time when driving and allow extra time to travel. If you need to take a break.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:38:48.168+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
