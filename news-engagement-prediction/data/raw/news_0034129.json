Gen. Mike Flynn's connections to Russia and the leaks from the intelligence community that brought him down.\nRep. Brian Mast said on CNN said Thursday the American people deserve both investigations, and his colleagues shouldn't let partisan politics get in the way of that.\n\"It's absolutely fair for people to ask questions, for people to expect that we go through the process of intelligence and oversight (committees) to look at all these issues and see what's going on here,\" Mast said.\nFlynn resigned Monday after reports surfaced that the White House knew for weeks that he had not told Vice President Mike Pence the full truth about his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. That information was leaked to the press from the intelligence community because Flynn's conversations with Kislyak were reportedly monitored through regular intelligence gathering on the Russian ambassador.\n  However, Republicans have been concerned about the intelligence community releasing information to bring down someone in an administration who has feuded with the intelligence community for months. Mast said that's a viable concern.\n\"That is an important part of it because that can undermine the internal workings of our national security, and that is very important,\" he said.\nBut, Mast also encouraged President Trump to be a bit more conspicuous in what he wants to say publicly about the American relationship with Russia.\nHe pointed to President Obama 's infamous \"red line\" statement about the Syrian civil war that ended up haunting the Democrat's final years in office after he backed away from that public statement. Mast encouraged Trump to keep more diplomatic conversations private.\n\"If he puts something out there that he can't walk back from, that's not what we're looking for,\" he said.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Shep Smith defends media against Trump \nFox News anchor Shepard Smith went off-script during his Thursday afternoon show to defend reporters after President Trump lambasted the media at a press conference earlier in the day.\n\"It's crazy what we're watching every day. It's absolutely crazy. [Trump] keeps repeating ridiculous, throwaway lines that are not true at all and sort of avoiding this issue of Russia as if we're some kind of fools for asking the question. Really? Your opposition was hacked and the Russians were responsible for it and your people were on the phone with Russia on the same day it was happening and we're fools for asking the questions? No, sir. We are not fools for asking these questions and we demand to know the answer to this question,\" Smith\nBy Anna Giaritelli â€¢ 02/16/17 5:15 PM  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T17:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:29:31.323+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
