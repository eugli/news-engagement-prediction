KING RODRIGUEZ/ Presidential Photo/FILE \nThe grisly slay of a South Korean businessman inside Camp Crame by anti-drug police was a “unique situation” that merits attention, Malacañang said Thursday. \nThe abduction-slay of the Jee Ick-joo led to the suspension of the Philippine National Police’s (PNP) anti-drug war known as “Oplan Tokhang” amid the “cleansing” within the police force. \n“The unique situation regarding that (South Korean’s) death merits attention,” Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella said in a Palace briefing. ADVERTISEMENT \nAsked why the death of around 7, 000 suspected drug offenders did not merit the suspension of Oplan Tokhang, Abella said: “They did not happen within the camp, right?” READ: Palace vows justice for Jee Ick-joo \nPNP chief Director General Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa on Monday ordered the suspension of Oplan Tokhang following Duterte’s order for the cleansing of the police force. \nDuterte has ordered the abolition of the PNP’s Anti-Illegal Drugs Group and all anti-drug units following the controversial abduction-killing of Jee in the guise of a drug operation.
