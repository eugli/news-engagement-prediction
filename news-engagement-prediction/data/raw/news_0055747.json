The 40-year-old actress, who played the lovable Natalie in the romcom, is hoping the \"magic\" will still be there as she reunites with her old friend Hugh Grant . Opening up about her part in the ten-minute featurette, Martine admitted that she hasn't seen the script yet, but she knows she'll be filming with Hugh, who plays the Prime Minister. \nThere was more to Martine and Hugh's kiss than we knew! \nOf their romance, she said: \"I'm hoping me and Hugh are still together because we're filming together. I haven't been sent a script, I've just been in wardrobe. I really hope they've had a couple of kids and he's still doing his silly dancing. I'm hoping the magic of it all comes back for something so lovely.\" \nGALLERY: Love Actually stars then and now \nMartine, who was speaking on Loose Women , and her co-star Hugh have stayed in touch since working on the comedy in 2003. \"We have this banter,\" she said. \"We're so different, from such different backgrounds, but it's why we work. He has a go at me, I have a go at him. He's lovely, we still DM and text, but I'm so excited to work with him again. I wouldn't feel right doing it without Hugh.\" Martine and Hugh are so close that the actress said she would have only considered doing the sequel if Hugh was on board too. \"When they asked me if I was doing it, I said 'Is Hugh doing it?' and apparently, he said, 'Is Martine doing it?' But I know he would have done it without me,\" said the star. VIEW GALLERY \"I really hope they've had a couple of kids and he's still doing his silly dancing,\" said Martine \nDirector Richard Curtis, who is making the sequel for Comic Relief , recently said that about two thirds of the old cast would feature. He confirmed that Emma Thompson, who played betrayed wife Karen, would not be making an appearance. Emma's co-star Alan Rickman, who played her husband Harry, sadly passed away in 2016. Richard added that a tribute to the actor had not been planned . \"You know dealing with Alan is very complicated so not really,\" he told the Press Association . \" Ems isn't in it . She just can't do it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:47:27.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
