The BJP is so weak as it has been unable to project a chief minister,” she said. \nIn all her rallies, Mayawati has been regularly raising the issue of the family feud in the hope that Muslim voters will end up voting for her. \nHer aggressive anti-BJP pitch too is aimed at attracting the Muslim vote, say experts. That is why she has focused on triple talaq, uniform civil code and Muslim personal law -- issues where some All India Muslim Personal Law Board members suspect the intentions of the BJP.
