Nick Viall couldn't keep the tears at bay during Monday's episode of the ABC dating show, breaking down in an epic meltdown in front of his remaining six suitors, where he questioned leaving the show altogether. EXCLUSIVE: 'Bachelor' Nick Viall Reveals His Three Frontrunners \"I'm sorry for interrupting, but I just wanted to be honest, and I wanted to be real with you guys,\" Nick said to the remaining women after sending Danielle L. home on the two-on-one date. \"I had, obviously, a two-on-one today, and I sent both Whitney and Danielle home,\" he continued, already wiping the tears off his face. \"Danielle, you know, my relationship with her was a relationship that I was really optimistic about, and along with you women, someone that I thought about, you know, this all working out. She was part of that equation.\" \"I just want to be honest, because I came in so optimistic about this whole thing. So I think after today ended, I just kind of feel like I hit a new low, because I think my biggest fear now is, 'Is the same thing going to happen, you know, with you guys?'\" Nick shared, now in full-on cry mode. \"I really want this work out, but I want it to be real and I want it to be right, and right now I just feel terrified that it's not going to happen. So, I don't know if I can keep doing this. I gotta go.\" Nick's breakdown was certainly the highlight of this episode, but with a record six women sent home this week (don't ask who -- we've already forgotten their names), tears flowed like the Rio Grande. Here's everyone else who cried this episode: Taylor, after coming back post-elimination to try to expose Corinne's lack of emotional intelligence: Kristina (and Nick!) when she told her heartbreaking life story: Corinne (probably) when she found a new nanny: Literally everyone who had to play volleyball on the group date: Jasmine, when she was sent home after offering to choke Nick in a sexual manner: The group date's survivors, crying in bed: Whitney, after she got sent home on the two-on-one date: Danielle, after she got sent home on the two-on-one date: And everyone after Nick fake-considered leaving the show: While this week's episode was emotional AF, as next week's promo teases, Nick's broken heart is about to be curedâ€¦ by Corinne's platinum vagine and \"top notch sex abilities.\" The Bachelor airs Mondays at 8 p.m. ET/PT on ABC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T06:30:08.607+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
