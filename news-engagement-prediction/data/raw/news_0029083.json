Has China beaten Nasa in building warp-drive technology dubbed the 'impossible engine'? CHINA claims to have pipped Nasa into building an ‘impossible’ warp drive engine that will help get humans to Mars in a matter of weeks. PUBLISHED: 12:01, Sun, Feb 12, 2017 | UPDATED: 16:27, Sun, Feb 12, 2017 \nBack in November, leaked documents showed that Nasa believed that it had cracked the once impossible warp drive mystery and were working on an engine that could drastically reduce the time that it takes to travel through space. \nSuper-fast warp drive – faster than any travel currently available – would make it possible to travel to the Moon in a matter of hours. \nThe warp drive Nasa was working on is an EM Drive which is an engine that would outperform any booster that is currently available and has no exhaust. \nThe technology works by bouncing microwaves around inside a closed engine. The microwaves subsequently push against the side of the container, acting as a propellor. GETTY China claims to have beaten Nasa in creating warp-drive technology Related articles GETTY China says it is using it on its Tianfgong 2 \nThis was once considered impossible as it violate Newton’s third law – for every action, there is an equal reaction. \nThe new engine would also make it possible to get humans to Mars within a month, compared to current technology which takes upwards of three months to get to the Red Planet. GETTY The technology will one day be used to get people to Mars \nThe news sent shockwaves around the scientific community who were impressed with Nasa’s feat, but now China says that it already has the technology in operation. \nThe China Academy of Space Technology (CAST) said that it has been funding research into the project since 2010, and Nasa’s news just “re-confirm” what they allegedly already knew. GETTY \"NASA’s published test results can be said to re-confirm the technology.\" \nThey added that they have been testing the device aboard the Tiangong-2 – China’s low-orbit manned satellite. \nDr Chen Yue, head of the communication satellite division at Cast said at a recent press conference: “National research institutions in recent years have carried out a series of long-term, repeated tests on the EmDrive. \n“NASA’s published test results can be said to re-confirm the technology. We have successfully developed several specifications of multiple prototype principles. \n“The establishment of an experimental verification platform to complete the milli-level micro thrust measurement test, as well as several years of repeated experiments and investigations into corresponding interference factors, confirm that in this type of thruster, thrust exists.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T19:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T05:03:21.777+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
