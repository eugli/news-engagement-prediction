Whether it comes in the form of a two-state solution, if that's what the parties want, or something else, if that's what the parties want, we're going to help them.\"\nHelp, not pressure. White House officials were adamant that \"it's not for us to impose that vision.\"\nAnd yet, it may be Israel's vision, no imposition necessary.\nIn December, Netanyahu said on \"60 Minutes\" that he would \"like to have President Trump , when he gets into the White House, help me work on that. I'd like to see if the Arab states can help me achieve that. It's a new reality. A new possibility.\"\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Kellyanne Conway: Leaks are 'dangerous stuff' These leaks about intelligence and security \"should concern everyone,\" Conway said.\nBy Daniel Chaitin • 02/14/17 7:40 PM \"That\" was a modified version of the two-state solution.\nOne other hot-button issue that will come up between Trump and Netanyahu when they talk Wednesday, White House officials promised, is Iran. And on that subject, Netanyahu is likely to have some measured words for the new American president.\n\"I have about five things in my mind\" to tell him about how to walk back some of the Obama administration's concessions to Iran, Netanyahu teased in December.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T03:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T05:02:38.798+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
