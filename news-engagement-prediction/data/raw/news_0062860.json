But best of all, ESPN’s Dick Vitale was on the call. If you’re not ready for March Madness yet, this call from Vitale will certainly get you there. John Gillon wins it at the buzzer for Cuse! #DUKEvsCUSE pic.twitter.com/MEW1SrkB3a \n— Brian Rauf (@brauf33) February 23, 2017 \nJust one more week. We missed you, March. \nGillon finished the game with 26 points. More NCAAB!
