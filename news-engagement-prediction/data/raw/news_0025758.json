Jim Goodness, spokesman for the archdiocese of Newark, told the outlet that rules “specifically state the teams should be boys or girls only.” But parents said there simply wasn’t enough interest from girls to form their own team. \nNo matter the rules, one player in the clip could not envision advancing to the postseason without all his teammates. “It’s not fair that we get to move on and they can’t,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T20:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T16:46:36.612+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
