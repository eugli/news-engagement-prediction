He said the US official had visited Singapore in 2008, and also met him with Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) leaders while Mr Mattis was CENTCOM Commander and leading operations in the Middle East where Singapore had contributed to operations. \n\"I was also very reassured of his remarks about security in (the) Asia-Pacific, and especially that he valued (the) defence relationship with Singapore,\" Dr Ng said. \n\"He valued our views and our assessment of our region, and (indicated) that the US wanted to play a very constructive role. Secretary Mattis said that he was very open to hear Singapore’s assessment,\" the minister added. \nDr Ng also invited Mr Mattis to the Shangri-La Dialogue, which will take place in June, and the Defense Secretary said he would attend. \n\"All in all, (we had) a very good first meeting. One that gives reassurance of stability and progress, and with very steady pair of hands in Secretary Mattis’ leadership. I hope that we have moved things towards a much more predictable and stable environment that we all hope for,\" Dr Ng said. - CNA/kk", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T09:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T04:55:03.364+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
