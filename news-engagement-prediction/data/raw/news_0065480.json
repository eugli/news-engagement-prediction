India, the world’s third-biggest greenhouse gas emitter, has set a target of raising its renewable energy generation to 175 gigawatt by 2022, around five times current usage, to supply power to its 1.3 billion people and fight climate change.\nThe government push, personally monitored by Prime Minister Narendra Modi , has prompted companies to bid aggressively for solar and wind projects, pushing tariffs low enough to challenge power generated by fossil fuels such as coal over the long term.\nIn an auction conducted by state-controlled Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) for various wind projects totalling 1 gigawatt, five companies separately Quote: d a tariff of 3.46 rupees ($0.0519) per unit to win the projects.\nYou may also like to watch this\n“After solar cost reduction below 3 rupees/unit, wind power cost down to 3.46 rupees/unit through transparent auction,” India’s coal, power and renewable energy minister, Piyush Goyal, said in a tweet on Friday.\nMytrah Energy , part of London-based Mytrah Group, Ostro Kutch Wind, backed by British private equity firm Actis, and Indian company Inox Wind Infrastructure won contracts for 250 megawatts (MW) each.\nGreen Infra Wind Energy, majority-owned by Singapore-based Sembcorp Industries Ltd, won a contract for 249.90 MW and Adani Green Energy, part of Indian billionaire Gautam Adani’s infrastructure group, was awarded a 50 MW project, according to a senior SECI official and a bid document seen by Reuters.\n“The auctions have been hard fought and have led to tighter pricing than one would have foreseen even a few months earlier,” said Vikram Kailas, chief executive of Mytrah Energy.\nThe other companies were not immediately available for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T00:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:17:02.407+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
