Some unimaginably simple science (fiction!) that makes the spacecraft travel large distances at ultra high speeds, bending the fabric of space and time. \nStar Trek’s USS Enterprise could travel at Warp 9 when required, though used to cruise at Warp Factor 1. That’s faster than the speed of light. It works when matter and anti-matter meet in presence of some dilithium crystals and the result is ejected by the engines. Although Scotty had a lot to do with the thing working properly and those dilithium crystals were a rare commodity. \nkajsalisa \nThen there was the Sakharov Drive in Arthur C Clarke’s ‘2010 Odyssey Two’. It used ‘pulsed thermonuclear reaction to heat and expel virtually any propellant material’. Spaceship Cosmonaut Alexi Leonov was able to reach Jupiter and find Dave Bowman and Discovery. \nBut in 2017, we’re still stuck with rockets that burn kerosene, hydrogen, hypergolic propellants etc. The fastest we have really ever gone is 58,000 km/h when the New Horizon probe was launched on top of the Atlas 5 rocket. Although most interplanetary probes have had to rely on gravity assist to gain speed! \nIt requires the spacecraft to approach a planet at such an angle that it is pulled by the gravitational force. This leads to an increase in the speed of the spacecraft which then slingshots its way forward. In the process of spacecraft gaining speed, the planet loses an equal amount of energy! \nwikimedia commons \nBut rocket fuels are not the only thing we have tried. Back in the 50s, NASA scientists looked to use the then new-fangled nuclear power to propel interplanetary rockets. But fear from the fallout of such a propulsion system and the following test ban treaties put rest to this. Thankfully. \nThe next generation propulsion technique has been developed by NASA, called the ion-thrusters. Here, the thrust is created by accelerating ions with electricity. NASA’s Deep Space 1 spacecraft used the NSTAR ion thruster that utilised xenon fuelled engine with high-voltage electrodes to accelerate the ions. \nCurrently, there are satellites in space that use ion-drive to stay in their respective orbits. \nNASA \nFuture plans include using the sun’s energy to push a spacecraft with a paper thin sail. Also on the drawing boards is the beamed propulsion tech that will supposedly let a spacecraft ride a laser. Then there’s Mexican scientist Miguel Alcubierre whose Alcubbierre drive uses Einstein’s theory of relativity to allow the spacecraft to travel faster than the speed of light. But all of this, at the current pace of development, may still be a few hundred years away.
