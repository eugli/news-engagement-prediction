Shannon Matthews was reported missing on the afternoon of 19 February 2008 in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, England when she was aged nine years old.\nLed by Detective Superintendent Andy Brennan, the search for her became a major missing person police operation and was even compared to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann.\nThe West Yorkshire Police questioned 1,500 motorists and searched 3,000 houses.\nBy 5 March, more than 250 officers and 60 detectives were involved in the investigation, about 10% of the West Yorkshire force's operational strength.\nRead More Who are Karen Matthews and Julie Bushby?
