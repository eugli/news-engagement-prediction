(Photo: Mark Henle/The Republic)\nStory Highlights SB 1409 would have allowed for the disabled students and parents to “double-dip” into taxpayer funds Rarely does the public see how that deal-making plays out behind the scenes 157 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 6 COMMENT EMAIL MORE A school-choice bill pushed by a lobbyist who could have benefited was pulled by the bill’s sponsor after The Arizona Republic started asking questions about it, but the lobbyist is vowing to find another way to advance a similar measure.\nThe legislation, the brainchild of lobbyist Mike Williams and sponsored by state Sen. Steve Montenegro, R.-Litchfield Park, would have allowed children in private schools to access at least $5,000 in public funds to pay for education-related services other than their private-school tuition, including tutoring, therapy, online learning, and even college tuition.\nSenate Bill 1409 would allow students with “neurological or genetic disorder or disease” that affects their ability to process information to tap both the state’s school tuition organizations tax credit and the Empowerment Scholarship Account program.\nCurrently, all students and their parents are prohibited from \"double-dipping\" into both taxpayer-funded programs.\nMontenegro pulled his support of the bill Monday, after The Republic started asking questions about it. He said he had become uneasy advocating for it. He declined to specify why he was uncomfortable with the bill.\n\"I will not be pursuing this matter any further,\" he said.\nWilliams said he will try to revive an amended version of the legislation later in the session.\nA window on the process Companies and special interests spend millions of dollars lobbying lawmakers at state capitols across the nation on an array of issues, from industry regulation to ideological issues such as abortion.\nEfforts to influence elected officials frequently include lobbyists authoring legislation that lawmakers then introduce on their behalf. Arizona does not require lawmakers to identify who actually authored the bills they sponsor.\nBut the newspaper’s inquiries into how SB 1409 came to be — and who it could benefit — provide a rare glimpse at how one lobbyist used his connections to advocate for a bill that could potentially help his family, as well as others in a similar situation.\nRELATED: The tuition tax credit: Tuition-aid benefits wealthy families, raises worry\nDiane Brown, executive director of the Arizona Public Interest Research Group, said it's rare to see a lobbyist push a bill he or she potentially could benefit from personally. Lobbyists usually work on behalf of their clients.\nIt's incumbent on legislators to take a close look at bills they sponsor to determine who could benefit and why, said Brown, whose organization advocates for consumer protection and good government.\n\"The bottom line is: Legislators need to understand the pieces of legislation they are sponsoring,\" she said.\nReferring questions to a lobbyist When first contacted Thursday by The Republic about his bill, Montenegro struggled to explain it and referred detailed questions to Williams. Montenegro said he was between votes and didn't have much time to discuss the legislation.\nSoon after, Montenegro summarized the bill’s intent, adding that Williams had provided the bill language and noting that Williams’ son has a neurological condition that would be covered under the bill.\n (Photo: Mark Henle/The Republic)\nMontenegro later said he introduced the legislation because students who have difficulty processing information should be given extra help. It's worthy legislation because it could spare parents from paying for costly educational services, he said.\nMontenegro said he was not unduly influenced by Williams and noted that he declined to sponsor \"five or six\" bills that Williams asked him to introduce this session.\nMontenegro gave conflicting statements when asked whether he knew when he filed the bill that Williams himself could financially benefit from it.\nHe said Williams presented him with the language about two weeks ago, as lawmakers faced a deadline to file bills. He said the portion allowing students to use both STO and ESA accounts should never have been included.\nBut, he said, he had grown uncomfortable with the bill.\n“I know this issue means a lot to a lot of parents, that’s why it was brought forward,\" he said. \"I just won’t be pursuing this bill any further.”\n'Will not take advantage' Montenegro said he hopes to see the Legislature pass an expansion of the state's Empowerment Scholarship Account to all 1.1 million schoolchildren by the 2020-2021 school year, an effort Republicans are trying to fast-track.\nRepublicans are advancing identical bills to carry out that expansion in both the state Senate and the House of Representatives to give them the ability to move the legislation quickly and more flexibility on when they bring it up for a vote.\nMontenegro's bill related to the neurological disorders, however, could have been a distraction to the full ESA expansion effort, especially in the Senate where one vote might decide the ESA expansion bill's fate.\nRELATED: Arizona school-voucher expansion afoot despite $102K of misspent funds in 6 months\nOn Tuesday, Republican Sen. Sylvia Allen, who chairs the Senate Education Committee, said she will not hear any version of Montenegro's SB 1409 because her focus is on the legislation to fully expand the ESA program. She said she talked to Williams about his desire to allow families to use both the STO and ESA programs, but considered the bill to be flawed.\nWilliams said his son is a freshman at a private school and uses the STO program. Were the bill to pass he “will not take advantage” of the program, he said.\nWilliams said his son receives $2,000 in an STO scholarship from his grandparents and he doesn’t want that fact to threaten endanger passage of the bill.\n“I’m really just trying to help a class of kids who are falling through the gap,” Williams said. “I specifically did not run this bill until he (his son) was far through high school because I didn’t want people thinking I was running it for a personal basis.”\nA new version? Williams, a longtime figure at the state Capitol, said he doesn’t have a client for this legislation and is working on it pro bono.\nNow that Montenegro has dropped his sponsorship of the legislation, Williams said he will try to advance the bill by inserting the language into another bill, a practice known as a striker.\nHe said the new version would allow parents whose kids have the specified conditions and attend private schools to draw funding from the ESA program for therapies, tutoring, textbooks and other educational services.\nThe new version will not allow use of both ESA funds and STO funds, he said.\nEven the most ardent backers of ESA expansion have not advocated for combining ESAs with school tuition organization scholarships.\nCharles Tack, the lobbyist and former spokesman for the Arizona Department of Education, for example, told the newspaper in an interview last year that students have been prevented from getting both because “you’d be getting state funding twice.”\nWilliams said he is trying to come up with a definition that would cover children with life-threatening or neurological diseases, such as cancer, cystic fibrosis or neurofibromatosis, which affects his son. He said the language could be that any child with a progressive, degenerative or malignant condition would qualify, similar to the requirements of the Make-A-Wish Foundation.\n\"I don’t need the public criticism,” Williams said. “This bill, because it looked like we were taking from both pots of money, which is never what I intended … that bill is going to go away. We’re going to start with something clean and fresh. So there’s not a stigma thinking that anyone is trying to take out of both pools. ...\n“We're going to try to find a different bill and run it clean where it is only an empowerment scholarship for disease,” Williams said.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2016/02/11/Phoenix/Phoenix/635907955037165794-state-of-the-state017.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//azc.cc/2ljqqPE&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3d5569507733ca056af5edaf0a2a8036c559fb13/r=500x375/local/-/media/2017/02/14/Phoenix/Phoenix/636227098727748875-ESAHenle.png", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//azc.cc/2ljqqPE&text=Lobbyist%20pushes%20Arizona%20school-choice%20bill%20that%20could%20benefit%20his%20family&via=azcentral", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2016/02/11/Phoenix/Phoenix/635907955037165794-state-of-the-state017.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4251d33cea40ac6c571b80946b9a901360e5eb37/c=204-0-3396-2400&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2016/02/11/Phoenix/Phoenix/635907955037165794-state-of-the-state017.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/02/14/Phoenix/Phoenix/636227098727748875-ESAHenle.png", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f6971d504a6d894cb7944de3d383c26c5c6bb869/c=0-0-533-401&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2017/02/14/Phoenix/Phoenix/636227098727748875-ESAHenle.png"], "published": "2017-02-16T01:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:14:37.274+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
