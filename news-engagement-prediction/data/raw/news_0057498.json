That's kind of the vibe I get listening to Dallas-bred Lil Texas' hyphy, four-track EP 4 Ever . \nHints of '90s R&B vibes are pitched up to post-millennial heights as the beat stays steady bangin' on some Chicago juke-level bounce. You could definitely see a Harajuku girl listening to this through her fuzzy, baby blue headphones. Interestingly enough, the EP is released through Japan's Trekkie Trax label. \n“My music for this EP is intended to take the listener through a journey of emotions, particularly love,” Lil Texas says in an emailed statement. “With love comes joy, excitement, vulnerability, and fear; all feelings that make the journey worthwhile. I channeled this notion while writing the tracks and am very pleased with the turn out. Major love for Trekkie Trax giving me this opportunity.” \n4 Ever opens strong and off-beat with its titular track and continues through Valentine hues of sound. “My Mind” is particularly enjoyable. “Woodgrain Fantasy” matches footwork rhythms with '90s anime pop-style melodies.
