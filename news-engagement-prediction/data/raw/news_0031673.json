In 2007 the number of registrations was as low as 670. \nIt is thought the pointy-eared canine could be top of the rankings by 2018, the first time the Labrador Retriever will have been knocked off the spot for 27 years. \nThe Labrador has been the most popular dog breed in the UK since 1990 - the year it overtook the Yorkshire Terrier. \nHowever, the Kennel Club is concerned the increase is due to people choosing the breed because it is considered fashionable, rather than because it is the most suitable for their lifestyle. \nKennel Club secretary Caroline Kisko said: \"While the French Bulldog is a lovely breed, it is very unwise for anyone to buy one simply because they think it looks cute or is a fashionable choice. \n\"The breed is a favourite with celebrities, who often flaunt them on their Instagram and Twitter accounts for people to coo over. Dog lover risks life wading across lake to save stranger's pet \n\"While it's normal to want to show off your dog, when celebrities do it, it usually results in a surge in the popularity of certain breeds, which is not a good thing as it opens the doors to unscrupulous breeders who see it as an opportunity to breed lots of them without due care to health and welfare.\" \nShe added that it was crucial for anyone intent on owning a French Bulldog to go a responsible breeder, such as a Kennel Club assured breeder. \nThe UK's largest dog welfare organisation is urging people to consider buying other similar breeds that may be better suited to their lifestyle and environment. \nThese include the Miniature Schnauzer, Beagle, Border Terrier and Welsh Terrier.
