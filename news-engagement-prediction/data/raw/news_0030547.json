The actress' phone was hacked and a couple of personal pictures had found their way to social media.\nA source says the phone's automatic sync was on, as a result of which all photographs clicked by her were getting saved on iCloud. She was in her hometown, London, when she couldn't log into her account for a few days and went to a local store for help. \"However, it was on February 7 when two pictures with her best friend having dinner appeared online that she realised her phone was hacked. She went to the service centre again before coming to India,\" adds a source.\nAmy says, \"I was shocked when this happened. This isn't a trivial matter and has to be taken up seriously. I will register a complaint with the cyber crime cell in London and ensure the hackers are taken to task. Cyber safety is the need of the hour.\" The actress will fly back to Mumbai soon and lodge a complaint with the cyber crime cell here as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T08:32:33.214+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
