By: FE Online | Published: February 4, 2017 10:41 AM TAMO Futuro to be powered by a mid-mounted 1.2 Revotron turbocharged engine which will be tuned to produce power figures between 150 hp and 180 hp. \nTata Motors has launched its new performance sub-brand TAMO and a new Passenger Vehicle (PV) strategy under which the company will unveil its first product, the Futuro on 7th March, 2017 before the upcoming Geneva Motor Show. TAMO, the company says, “will act as an incubating centre of innovation towards new technologies, business models and partnerships in order to define future mobility solutions.” \nExpected to be launched in 2018, the Tata Futuro will be the first sportscar by Tata Motors and is expected to be priced around Rs 25 lakh, ex-showroom, Delhi. According to the company, the car will be “a stunning-looking car for the money” and will be designed in-house. The Tata Futuro is a two-seater sportscar and will be produced in limited numbers, 250 units initially. \nThe Tata Futuro will use lightweight body construction, which could be a mix of both, carbon-fibre and aluminium along with new technologies and innovations. Tata Motors currently uses six vehicle platforms but the TAMO will use only two in favour of a lean and efficient operating approach. The Futuro will be based on the flexible Advanced Modular Platform (AMP) to reduce the overall weight and will weigh around 700 kg. This will give the car a respectable power-to-weight ratio and will further aid the low emissions and fuel efficiency of the car. The AMP platform is capable of producing a wide range of vehicles ranging from a hatchback to a sportscar. TAMO Futuro will be based on the flexible Advanced Modular Platform (AMP) to reduce the overall weight and will weigh around 700 kg. \nThe company has not yet confirmed the powertrain details but we expect the Futuro to be powered by a mid-mounted 1.2 Revotron turbocharged engine which will be tuned to produce power figures between 150 hp and 180 hp. TAMO will not operate a separate retail chain, like Maruti Suzuki 's premium outlet – NEXA, and all its products will be sold through the regular Tata Motors dealerships. \nAlso Read: From Nano to a sportscar, Tata Motors’ TaMo will have a huge perception gap to bridge \nThe TAMO Futuro will play a key role in reshaping the brand perception of Tata Motors as the company tries to move to higher vehicle segments and more matured international markets. While the Futuro will be produced in limited numbers, technologies used in it will later trickle down to mas-market vehicles of Tata Motors, benefiting the overall passenger vehicles division in terms of rapid and cost-effective technology development and deployment.
