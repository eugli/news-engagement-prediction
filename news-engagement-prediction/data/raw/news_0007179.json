Ryan has not commented on the order since Friday. \nThe order bans citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries—Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen—from entering the United States for 90 days. It also pauses the inflow of refugees for 120 days and bars entry for Syrian refugees until their admission \"is consistent with the national interest.\" The text sparked chaos and protests at airports across the country, where individuals with valid visas were detained and confusion mounted over how the order applied to green card holders. \n\"We should not simply turn away individuals who already have lawful U.S. visas or green cards—like those who have risked their lives serving alongside our forces overseas or who call America their home,\" McCaul's statement read. \nAs confusion surrounding the order escalated, several other top Republicans raised concerns about the text and its implementation. \n\"We all share a desire to protect the American people, but this executive order has been poorly implemented, especially with respect to green card holders,\" Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Bob Corker said in a statement. \n\"The administration should immediately make appropriate revisions, and it is my hope that following a thorough review and implementation of security enhancements that many of these programs will be improved and reinstated.\" \nArizona senator John McCain and South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham also expressed concern Sunday that the order could threaten national security. \n\"Ultimately, we fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism,\" they wrote . \"This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country. That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security.\" Web Link: http://www.weeklystandard.com/article/2006564", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T08:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T04:09:54.897+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
