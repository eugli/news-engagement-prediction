Curry said he was surprised to see Plank endorse Trump.\n\"I spent all day yesterday on the phone,\" Curry said, \"with countless people at Under Armour, countless people in Kevin Plank's camp, my team, trying to understand what was going on and where everybody stood on the issue. Based off the release that KP sent out this morning, and what he told me last night, that's the Under Armour that I know. That's the brand I know he's built and one that, as of Wednesday afternoon, is something that I'm standing on.\"\nCurry said Plank has informed him the \"asset\" comment was meant in regard to Trump's potential to do good for American businesses, not a show of support for the president's remarks on every social or policy issue.\n\"It's a fine line but it's about how we're operating,\" Curry said, \"how inclusive we are, what we stand for. He's the President. There are going to be people that are tied to them. But are we promoting change? Are we doing things that are going to look out for everybody? And not being so self-serving that it's only about making money, selling shoes, doing this and that. That's not the priority. It's about changing lives. I think we can continue to do that.\"\nStill, Curry says he will monitor Under Armour's policies to make sure they do not change to something he does not support.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Republicans united under Trump, but trade threatens to divide the party \"There is a bit of a concern on the trade issue,\" Mercedes Schlapp said.\nBy David M. Drucker • 02/09/17 12:17 AM \"If there is a situation where I can look at myself in the mirror and say they don't have my best intentions, they don't have the right attitude about taking care of people,\" Curry said. \"If I can say the leadership is not in line with my core values, then there is no amount of money, there is no platform I wouldn't jump off if it wasn't in line with who I am. So that's a decision I will make every single day when I wake up. If something is not in line with what I'm about, then, yeah, I definitely need to take a stance in that respect.\"\nTop Story Democrats scrap all-nighters after DeVos, Sessions votes  thons.\"\nBy Pete Kasperowicz • 02/09/17 12:01 AM Share  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T01:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T09:49:02.122+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
