(AP Photo) After the ear-shattering pre-landing barrage, and the commotion of the landing, a strange peace descended on Okinawa. Anomalous as it was be speaking an absence of Japanese resistance to the invasion of the doorstep to their homeland, the hush was in a sense fitting, since the opening day of the operation was on April 1 Easter of 1945. Behind the forward thrusts of the spearheads, marines and soldiers first warily, then with delight took advantage of the pastoral calm. Their foxholes dug, and the primary installations set up, they broke open chow rations, chose pets from among the goats roaming about, strolled around the rolling littoral, or just stretched out for forty winks. The battle was not won, or even joined. But to these hardened Veterans of Guadalcanal, Bougainville, Tarawa, Palau and Leyte, this was the oddest invasion of them all one which was truly symbolized by the designation for the opening day of the assault: âLove-Dayâ.
