On Wednesday, Ivanka Trump posted an Instagram of herself standing with her five-year-old daughter Arabella in front of the Supreme Court revealing that they had attended a hearing that morning. “I’m grateful for the opportunity to teach her about the judicial system in our country firsthand,” reads the photo’s caption. Arabella and I visited the Supreme Court this morning and attended a hearing. I'm grateful for the opportunity to teach her about the judicial system in our country firsthand. #SCOTUS #SupremeCourt #ImportantLessons #MotherDaughter A post shared by Ivanka Trump (@ivankatrump) on Feb 22, 2017 at 8:48am PST The first daughter and granddaughter were at the court as invited guests of Justice Anthony Kennedy, CNN reports. The duo listened to a technical case examining the question: “Do Arbitration Agreements between Nursing Homes and Patients Violate Public Policy or are they enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act.” The teaching moment comes a few weeks after Ivanka Trump’s father, President Donald Trump, called the U.S. legal system “broken” and criticized judges who opposed his executive order on immigration. Our legal system is broken! \"77% of refugees allowed into U.S. since travel reprieve hail from seven suspect countries.\" (WT) SO DANGEROUS! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 11, 2017 What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017 The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017 I have instructed Homeland Security to check people coming into our country VERY CAREFULLY. The courts are making the job very difficult! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017 The order was issued at the beginning of this month and suspended the entry of all refugees to the United States for 120 days, barred Syrian refugees indefinitely, and blocked U.S. entry for citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries for at least 90 days.
