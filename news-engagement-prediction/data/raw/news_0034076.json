The phone might have a different name when it is launched, and it is said to be the last BlackBerry phone to sport a physical keypad. \nThe event will happen in Spain's Barcelona, at the Mobile World Congress expo at 11:30 PM IST. BlackBerry had already teased the device briefly at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas early this January, revealing the phone's major specs and features.

Unlike the Priv, however, the Mercury features the physical keyboard in continuation with the touch screen. The design is old-school BlackBerry, something similar to the popular compact and classic BlackBerry. \nThe phone is designed and manufactured by TCL. BlackBerry had officially announced that it will not manufacture smartphones anymore and will work on Software and services. It is working at making its Android based OS more secure by 'hardening' it from within and we got to see that on its recent smartphones -- the DTEK 50 and the DTEK 60. TCL is apparantly targeting BlackBerry fans that loved its classic keyboard design, as future of the smartphone are with big screen devices and the Mercury gives up about half of its screen for the keyboard. The company is already selling the DTEK 50 and DTEK 60 smartphone in India that have 5.2-inch and 5.5-inch display respectively and run Android Marshmallow 6.0. \nThe Mercury, it has been confirmed, will run Android Nougat out-of-the-box with BlackBerry's usual suit of security and productivity applications. It comes with a 4.5-inch 1080p display with the chipset expected to be a Snapdragon 635 with 3GB RAM and 32GB on-board storage. It has a fingerprint sensor at front and 18-megapixel camera in the rear. \n\"The latest BlackBerry smartphone is focused on three core features: security, productivity and reliability. Previewed at CES, the smartphone draws on unparalleled mobile security and software expertise to offer the most complete end-to-end smartphone security available on Android,\" TCL Communication (TCT) had said in a press statement .
