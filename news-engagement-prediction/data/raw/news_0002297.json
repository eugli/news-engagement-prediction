Jason Pierre-Paul (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 4:53 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 4:53 p.m. ET \nJason Pierre-Paul settled his lawsuit with Adam Schefter and ESPN Friday, avoiding a court battle in the invasion-of-privacy case. \nPierre-Paul's Miami-based law firm, Holland & Knight, sent a letter to Judge Marcia G. Cooke informing her that the sides had \"amicably resolved this matter.\" Terms of the settlement were not disclosed. \nPierre-Paul was injured in a July 4, 2015 fireworks accident that caused him to lose his index finger and damage his hand. Schefter obtained Pierre-Paul's medical charts and posted a picture of them on social media. \nESPN released a statement supporting Schefter and the company's decision to report the story as it did. \"ESPN continues to firmly believe that its reporting about Mr. Pierre-Paulâs July 2015 injury, including the use of a medical chart that definitively described the seriousness of the injury and resulting treatment, was both newsworthy and journalistically appropriate. Despite their different points of view, the parties have agreed to amicably resolve their dispute rather than continue their litigation.\" \nPierre-Paul's lawyers told media outlets the defensive end would not make any further comments on the situation.
