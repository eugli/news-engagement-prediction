Within a few of the strongest storms, isolated tornadoes can develop.\n\"The greatest threat for severe thunderstorms and a few tornadoes will extend eastward along the Interstate 10 corridor from the upper Texas coast to the Florida Panhandle,\" according to AccuWeather Lead Storm Warning Meteorologist Eddie Walker.\n\"The severe weather threat will sweep eastward at a rapid pace,\" Walker said.\nDuring Tuesday morning, this threat will extend from Corpus Christi to Houston and Beaumont, Texas.\nThe severe thunderstorm and tornado threat will shift to Lake Charles, Louisiana, during Tuesday afternoon.\nDuring Tuesday night, the threat will shift farther east along the Gulf coast from near Baton Rouge and New Orleans, Louisiana, to Mobile, Alabama, and Pensacola, Florida.\n\"Overall we expect only a few isolated tornadoes with this event, unlike the outbreak that occurred last week,\" Walker said.\nEven so, all it takes is one tornado to hit a populated area to put lives and property at risk, Walker stated.\nPeople on the road or spending time outdoors should keep an eye out for rapidly changing weather conditions and monitor severe weather bulletins as they are issued.\nNorth of the severe thunderstorm threat, downpours will slow travel from part of north-central and northeastern Texas into Tuesday evening.\nDuring Wednesday, the drenching rain will shift across the Southeastern states.", "external_links": ["http://admin.brightcove.com/js/BrightcoveExperiences.js", "https://accuweather.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/32ddf17/2147483647/resize/590x/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Faccuweather-bsp.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6b%2Fe3%2Fcdd8b5674527bc655b8242880cb8%2Fstatic-severe-weather-risk-tues.jpg", "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/share/source/accuweather.png", "http://www.accuweather.com/"], "published": "2017-02-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:50:07.462+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
