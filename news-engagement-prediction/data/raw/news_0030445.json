It is in the process of carrying out a major cost-cutting drive.\n\"We must ensure our wide ranging business transformation programme delivers the full benefits expected, not only in terms of cost savings but also the cultural and behavioural changes necessary to ensure the transformation is sustained and high standards of business conduct are maintained,\" said Mr East.\n\"These are essential if we are to become a more trusted, resilient company.\"\nRolls-Royce has apologised \"unreservedly\" for the corruption cases , which spanned 25 years, and involved illegally using local middlemen and paying bribes to win deals in Indonesia, Thailand, China and Russia.\nAnalysis: Dominic O'Connell, Today business presenter In the whacky world of the City, bad headlines can sometimes be ignored.\nThat has been the case with Rolls-Royce; when it said last month it would pay £671m to settle a long-running bribery investigation its shares went up 6%.\nInvestors were relieved the worst was behind it, and the same may apply to today's whacking loss. While it underlines the complicated nature of Rolls-Royce's business - it has a £30bn currency hedging book, designed, ironically, to flatten out volatility, and has unkindly been described as a hedge fund with an engine maker attached - shareholders will focus on underlying trading.\nThere, the news is a bit better than expected, with cashflow and profit both slightly ahead of market expectations.\nAfter an annus horribilis (or two) Rolls-Royce still has some big strategic questions. It is still expanding production at a breakneck pace, which drains its reserves, and must still decide whether to take the drastic medicine advocated by some and shed some of its operations, such as the marine engine operation.\nWarren East, the chief executive, gave a hint that he is coming to some conclusions on the future of the company - he said he expected to set out a \"vision\" in the next few months.", "external_links": ["https://news.bbcimg.co.uk/news/special/market-data-charts/1.2/srcdoc-polyfill.js", "https://news.bbcimg.co.uk/news/special/market-data-charts/1.2/all.min.js", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/889D/production/_94637943_fpvxncb6.jpg", "https://news.bbcimg.co.uk/news/special/market-data-charts/1.2/srcdoc-polyfill", "https://news.bbcimg.co.uk/news/special/market-data-charts/1.2/pym.min.js", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38644114", "https://www.rolls-royce.com/investors/results-centre.aspx#key-financials", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/D84D/production/_94637355_mediaitem94637354.jpg", "https://news.bbcimg.co.uk/news/special/market-data-charts/1.2/pym.min"], "published": "2017-02-14T12:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T10:45:47.880+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
