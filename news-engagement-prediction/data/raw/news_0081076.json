I'm giving birth!\" \nChloe Ferry and Marnie Simpson are then revealed to be the doctors handling the birth, with Marnie telling him to \"shut up and push\". Chloe and Marnie are the doctors (Photo: GeordieShore/Instagram) Some fans believe the trailer is insensitive to Charlotte (Photo: GeordieShore/Instagram) \nGaz lets out a high-pitched scream and Aaron begins puffing on gas and air as Chloe pulls a variety of items, such as a traffic cone and a bucket of fried chicken, from between Gaz's legs. \nBefore long, Gaz begins 'giving birth' to the new Geordie Shore cast members, before letting out yet another high-pitched scream that can apparently be heard from space. \nThe message 'The family's getting bigger' pops up on the screen as the newbies dance around and Chloe starts tucking into the fried chicken Gaz just 'birthed'.

[sic] \nAnd another commented: \"not sure if you guys could be more insensitive?\" \n\"bit tactless considering his history with Charlotte,\" said another fan.
