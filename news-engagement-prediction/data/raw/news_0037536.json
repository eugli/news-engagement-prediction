They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters. \nAbdullah Sherif, a volunteer first responder, said he helped pull the bodies of four women from the rubble and that rescuers were still looking for survivors. He said there was only one airstrike, not two. Conflicting accounts are common in the aftermath of attacks. \nThe war in Yemen has killed more than 10,000 civilians and displaced over three million people. \nA Saudi-led coalition has been fighting the Houthis and forces loyal to a former Yemeni president since March 2015. The campaign is aimed at restoring the internationally recognized government of the president, Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi.

It’s total failure,” he said. \nHe said the four hospitals treated over 10,000 people in 2016. \nSaudi Arabia has also suffered losses, especially along its frontier with Yemen, where cross-border attacks are common. \nThe state-run Saudi Press Agency has announced the deaths of six Saudi soldiers over the past week, saying they were “defending the religion and the nation on the southern border” without providing further details.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T06:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:24:07.937+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
