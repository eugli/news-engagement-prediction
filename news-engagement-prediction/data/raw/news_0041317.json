Sultan Ibrahim striking the drum to launch the procession as Crown Prince Tunku Ismail looks on. \nSultan Ibrahim waved as the participants chanted heng ah ! (prosperity) and huat ah! (good fortune) as well as Daulat Tuanku as they passed the main stage, which was set up at the Komtar JBCC's entrance here. \n“Deities” from the five main clans in Johor, namely Hakka, Teochew, Hokkien, Cantonese and Hainan, were taken on a 9km tour on foot to bless the city and its people. \nThe crowd was treated to elaborately decorated floats, big head dolls, bearers of huge flags from the five clans, lion and dragon dance performances as well as fireworks throughout the four-hour event. \ndimsum.my , Malaysia's latest subscription video-on-demand service, also made its debut at the event with a prosperity-themed float, in-line with the year of the rooster. \nBased on the concept of a sailing boat, the float indicates a successful year ahead for dimsum.my , accompanied by five koi fish to represent “five concurrent users”, one of the key features of the service. \nA red rooster sits up front, also in dimsum.my's colour. \nOrganised annually by the Johor Ancient Temple, the procession, which takes pride in its 147-year old history, marked the end of the Chinese New Year celebrations. \nThis year’s parade featured 85 floats.
