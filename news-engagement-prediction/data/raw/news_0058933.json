Affirmative Language \nLanguage (by word or thought) is the way you have formed negative and positive programming through out your lifetime, saying things to yourself, about yourself, over and over. After thoughts are repeated, they soon become a BELIEF, and as a result, we think this belief is our reality. Unfortunately, in this way, we form fears of poverty, health, weight, and relationships; also the emotions connected with these beliefs can even become our comfort zone , no matter how negative they might be. Changing Our Language-Created Beliefs \nSince we created these beliefs we can also change them. This is where real freedom comes from.Focused affirmations are a great way to start your new tomorrows. When you feel tension, stress, or any type of anxiety, an affirmation which makes you feel good is where you need to go. \nMy favorite affirmation is: I AM POWERFUL. These simply stated 3 words makes me feel so good! However, for the affirmations to work you must not only say something which makes you feel better. See it, Feel it, Breathe it in, Even Taste it! \nYou must FEEL the power in your words. Say whatever makes you feel good, and at the same time picture yourself in a happy scenario doing or being your desire. \nThe more emotion you embrace the faster you will draw it towards you. Listed below are a few suggested affirmations to try, but the best ones are ones are those that you make up yourself. I AM POWERFUL MONEY (LOVE, GOOD HEALTH, PERFECT WEIGHT, ETC.) COMES TO ME EASILY AND EFFORTLESSLY I AM ALWAYS BALANCED AND CENTERED I AM IN PERFECT HEALTH I GIVE AND RECEIVE LOVE ALL THE TIME I AM JOYFUL I LOOK AND FEEL WONDERFUL I AM BEYOND HAPPY \nIf it takes saying them over and over a thousand things a day, then do it. If you say an affirmation when you are feeling really down, and you don't think it's doing anything for you, just keep on. Have some faith. Every time you say something positive you will bit-by-bit feel better. A little bit of feeling better is better than lots of feeling depressed. \nGo for it, and live in Love, Peace and Joy \nAbout this Contributor: Gail Bell is a powerful healer who is a graduate of the Silva Mind Control Method and Transcendental Meditation.
