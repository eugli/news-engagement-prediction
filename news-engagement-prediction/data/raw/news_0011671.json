faster, more convenient.\nIf more travellers are willing to pay twice as much to fly, it hardly makes sense for inflation statistics to record that the cost of the journey has suddenly doubled.\nIt was to raise this question over the way we measure inflation that Bill Nordhaus started fooling around with wood fires, oil lamps and light meters.\nProf Nordhaus found the Roman oil lamp offered much better light He wanted to unbundle the cost of a single quality that humans have cared deeply about since time immemorial, using the state-of-the-art technology of different ages: illumination.\nLight is measured in lumens, or lumen-hours.\nA candle gives off 13 lumens while it burns.\nA typical modern light bulb is almost 100 times brighter than that.\nProhibitively expensive Imagine gathering and chopping wood 10 hours a day for six days.\nThose 60 hours of work would produce 1,000 lumen hours of light.\nThat is the equivalent of one modern light bulb shining for just 54 minutes, although what you would actually get is many more hours of dim, flickering light instead.\nOf course, light is not the only reason to burn fires: they also help keep you warm, cook your food and scare off wild animals.\nIf you just needed light and a wood fire was your only option, you might decide to wait until the Sun comes up.\nThousands of years ago, better options came along - candles from Egypt and Crete, and oil lamps from Babylon.\nTheir light was steadier and more controllable, but still prohibitively expensive.\nIn a diary entry of May 1743, the president of Harvard University, the Reverend Edward Holyoake, noted that his household had spent two days making 78lb (35kg) of tallow candles.\nSix months later, he noted: \"Candles all gone.\"\nAnd those were the summer months.\nMore from Tim Harford The iPhone at 10: How the smartphone became so smart\nThe steel box that changed global trade\nThe hidden strengths of unloved concrete\nHow the barcode changed retailing\nNor were these the clean-burning paraffin wax candles we use today.\nThe wealthiest could afford beeswax, but most people - even the Harvard president - used tallow candles, stinking, smoking sticks of animal fat.\nMaking them involved heating up animal fat and dipping and re-dipping wicks into the molten lard.\nIt was pungent and time-consuming work.\nA tallow chandler dips a frame of candles into a bath of liquid fat According to Prof Nordhaus's research, if you set aside one whole week a year to spend 60 hours devoted exclusively to making candles - or earning the money to buy them - that would enable you to burn a single candle for just two hours and 20 minutes every evening.\nThings improved a little as the 18th and 19th Centuries unfolded.\nCandles were made of spermaceti - the milk-hued oily gloop harvested from dead sperm whales.\nAmerican founding father Ben Franklin loved the strong, white light they gave off, and the way they \"may be held in the hand, even in hot weather, without softening\", and noted that they \"last much longer\".\nGreat leap forward While the new candles were pleasing, they were also pricey.\nGeorge Washington calculated that burning a single spermaceti candle for five hours a night all year would cost him £8, or well over $1,000 (£820) in today's money.\nA few decades later, gas lamps and kerosene lamps helped to lower costs.\nThey also saved the sperm whale from extinction.\nBut they, too, were basically an expensive hassle.\nThey dripped, smelt and set fire to things.\nThomas Edison's carbon filament light bulbs represented an enormous technological leap forward Then something changed.\nThat something was the light bulb.\nBy 1900, one of Thomas Edison's carbon filament bulbs would provide you with 10 days of bright, continuous illumination, 100 times as bright as a candle, for the money you could earn with our 60-hour week of hard labour.\nBy 1920, that same week of labour would pay for more than five months' continuous light from tungsten filament bulbs.\nBy 1990, it was 10 years.\nA couple of years after that, thanks to compact fluorescent bulbs, it was more than five times longer.\nIcon of innovation The labour that had once produced the equivalent of 54 minutes of quality light now produced 52 years.\nAnd modern LED lights continue to get cheaper and cheaper.\nSwitch off a light bulb for an hour and you are saving illumination that would have cost our ancestors all week to create.\nIt would have taken Benjamin Franklin's contemporaries all afternoon.\nBut someone in a rich industrial economy today could earn the money to buy that illumination in a fraction of a second.\nLED bulbs offer sharper, cheaper and more energy efficient illumination And of course our light bulbs are clean, safe and controllable - no flicker, pig fat stink or risk of fire.\nThe light bulb has become an icon of innovation.\nIt has transformed our society into one where we can work, read, sew or play whenever we want to, regardless of how dark the night has become.\nBut the price of light alone tells a fascinating story: it has fallen by a factor of 500,000, far faster than official inflation statistics suggest.\nA thing that was once too precious to use is now too cheap to notice.\nTim Harford writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.
