Jefferson Middle School Academy in Washington, D.C. February 10,   Education Secretary   Jefferson Middle School Academy today and met with D.C. Public Schools Chancellor Antwan Wilson, Jefferson Academy Principal Greg Dohmann, Superintendent Natalie Gordon, Chief of Schools John Davis, and other school leaders and administrators, including Jefferson Academy teachers and students. \n  \n\"I thank D.C. Public Schools Chancellor Antwan Wilson, Jefferson Middle School Academy Principal Greg Dohmann, Superintendent Natalie Gordon and a tremendous team of administrators, teachers and students for welcoming me to Jefferson Middle School Academy today. Jefferson Academy is a public middle school on the rise and a great example of the successful collaborative innovations occurring within the D.C. Public Schools system. \n\"Focusing on their students and families is at the heart of Jefferson Academy's approach, and that's exactly what I believe is at the heart of providing an exceptional education. Great teachers and leaders help make great schools, and I was honored to speak with Jefferson's team about our shared commitment to strengthening public education. \n\"I respect peaceful protest, and I will not be deterred in executing the vital mission of the Department of Education. No school door in America will be blocked from those seeking to help our nation's school children.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T01:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T03:27:36.406+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
