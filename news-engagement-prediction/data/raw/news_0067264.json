Attached to the email were said to be machine drawings of Otto's LiDAR circuit board.\n\"Its design bore a striking resemblance to Waymo's unique LiDAR design,\" Waymo said.\n\"We found that six weeks before his resignation this former employee, Anthony Levandowski, downloaded over 14,000 highly confidential and proprietary design files for Waymo's various hardware systems, including designs of Waymo's LiDAR and circuit board.\n\"To gain access to Waymo's design server, Mr Levandowski searched for and installed specialised software onto his company-issued laptop. Once inside, he downloaded 9.7 GB of Waymo's highly confidential files and trade secrets, including blueprints, design files and testing documentation.\n\"Then he connected an external drive to the laptop. Mr Levandowski then wiped and reformatted the laptop in an attempt to erase forensic fingerprints.\"\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook .
