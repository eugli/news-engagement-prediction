Only 49 per cent saw a starling, down 5 per cent from 2015. The house sparrow was also seen fewer times than in 2015 \nH owever 60 per cent of the 2,600 people surveyed said they had done something to help the plight of hedgehogs last year such as stopping using slug pellets, or keeping an eye out for the animals before using strimmers or lighting bonfires. \n“Gardeners are increasingly acting to help wildlife, but the question is can we do it fast enough to halt this sharp decline in numbers?” said Lucy Hall, BBC Gardeners’ World Editor. \n“Our message to all garden owners is to see your outdoor space as a small-scale nature reserve – part of a network of gardens that link to make a great big, valuable habitat. \n“Seen like this, every small step you can make to help wildlife really does make a big difference when we all act together.” Which wild animals have you spotted in your garden in the last year? | Results 2016 \nT he hedgehog figures are particularly worrying because more of the animals should have been present this year. \nUsually July to September is the peak of hedgehog activity in gardens when young hoglets can also be seen, but activity declines steeply with the arrival of winter. \nHowever hedgehogs were spotted later in the year than usual by the British Trust for Ornithology , (BTO) whose members also look out for the creatures during their annual bird counts. \nClaire Boothby, Garden BirdWatch at the BTO, said, “We know that gardens are a useful resource for hedgehogs, which are a nationally declining species. \n\"The long-term weekly data collected through BTO Garden BirdWatch allows us to monitor the fortunes of hedgehogs and other wildlife in gardens and assess changes. It will also tell us whether they emerge early or late this coming spring.” \nOther creatures which fared badly in 2016 included ladybirds, with sightings down by five per cent in the last year, compared with 84 per cent spotting one in 2016; and only 40 per cent of respondents spotted a peacock butterfly last year, down 4 per cent on the previous year, with small tortoiseshell butterflies faring even worse, with sightings down 6 per cent to 29 per cent.
