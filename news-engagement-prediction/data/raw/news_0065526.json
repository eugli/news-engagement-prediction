Jeff Weiner Center for the Performing Arts is set to break ground March 6, putting the venue’s third theater on track for a May 2020 debut. \n“Great things are worth waiting for, and this is certainly one of them,” Dr. Phillips Center President and CEO Kathy Ramsberger said Tuesday. \nBut first, Orlando’s City Council will be asked to sign off next week on the project’s expected cost of at least $227.5 million, a figure that has grown steadily in recent years as the arts center struggled to find funding for Steinmetz Hall, a planned 1,700-seat venue. \nThat work is not yet done, because the Dr. Phillips Center still must raise $14.7 million to fund all construction costs fully. Ramsberger said next month’s milestone should help with that, by persuading hesitant donors to get on board.

The county took over the city’s debt obligations last year to give the arts center its $45 million boost, freeing up those reserves.

If current estimates hold, the Dr. Phillips Center’s final price tag will top $550 million. \nSteinmetz Hall, expected to be the new home of the Orlando Ballet, Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra and Opera Orlando, will be second-largest of the arts center’s three theaters, behind the 2,700-plus-seat Walt Disney Theater. \nThe hall is named for Chuck Steinmetz and Margery Pabst Steinmetz, who donated $12 million toward its construction in 2015. \nThe arts center’s second phase also will add a new rehearsal and performance space dubbed the Green Room, as well as additional back-of-house support spaces and kitchens. \nAt the time the $329 million first phase opened in 2014, the second phase was expected to cost about $186 million, but estimates climbed even as officials hunted for funding, something Ramsberger attributed mostly to market forces and an improving economy. \n“The costs go up the longer we wait, so the goal was to close the gap as soon as we could,” she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:55:08.775+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
