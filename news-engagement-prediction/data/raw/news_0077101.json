REUTERS/Brendan McDermid By Yashaswini Swamynathan \nU.S. stocks looked set to open slightly lower on Monday as investors paused to assess Wall Street's recent record-setting run. \nInvestors will be closely watching President Donald Trump's address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday evening for clues on his proposed tax reform and his plans to overhaul the Affordable Healthcare Act. \nTrump's promise a few weeks ago of a \"phenomenal\" tax announcement helped rekindle a post-election rally, driving the main U.S. markets to record highs. \nBut since then, markets have traded range-bound amid caution due to sparse details on Trump's agenda. Utilities and telecom services stocks - traditionally defensive plays of the S&P 500 index - outperformed the other sectors last week. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI hit its 11th straight record close on Friday, despite just a 0.05 percent rise. \n\"The market activity suggests another mixed session today as investors await the key events of the week,\" Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial wrote. \nDow e-minis 1YMc1 were down 15 points, or 0.07 percent at 8:31 a.m. ET, with 28,798 contracts changing hands. \nS&P 500 e-minis ESc1 were down 1.5 points, or 0.06 percent, with 179,384 contracts traded. \nNasdaq 100 e-minis NQc1 were down 10.5 points, or 0.2 percent, on volume of 27,353 contracts. \nAmong stocks, electric carmaker Tesla ( TSLA.O ) slipped 3.1 percent to $249 in premarket trading after Goldman Sachs downgraded the company's stock to \"sell\" from \"neutral\" and lowered its price target. \nApple ( AAPL.O ) edged up 0.2 percent after Warren Buffett told CNBC that Berkshire Hathaway ( BRKa.N ) had bought 120 million shares of the iPhone maker this year. \nLa Jolla Pharmaceutical ( LJPC.O ) jumped 30 percent to $25.76 following the success of its lead experimental drug in a late-stage study. \nShutterstock ( SSTK.N ) dropped 11 percent to $46 after the stock image provider reported quarterly revenue that missed analysts' average estimate. \n(Reporting by Yashaswini Swamynathan in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T20:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T16:11:14.370+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
