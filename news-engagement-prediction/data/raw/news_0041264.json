Speaking at a South Tampa Chamber of Commerce luncheon Wednesday, Higgins spoke of the social impact of the game. 15 photos Playoff Playlist concert series in Curtis Hixon Park in downtown Tampa during the College… more “We wanted to have attendance records across the board at every one of the events,” Higgins said. “But, one of the things that people don’t know is what an impact the event is still having on our community from a social standpoint.” The Extra Yard for Teachers program, for example, infused $1 million into Tampa Bay’s local school systems in Hillsborough, Pasco and Pinellas counties. On Jan 9, a record number of spectators , specifically 74,512, packed Raymond James Stadium and watched Clemson University beat the University of Alabama 35-31. While Higgins said the final numbers are still being tabulated, Tampa officials hope the game has an economic impact equal to or perhaps greater than the $308 million Dallas saw in 2015 and the $274 million in Phoenix last year. \"We haven't had a major event in our community with the Riverwalk completed,\" Higgins said. \"The way the Riverwalk is designed to connect different event venues ... it was incredible. On Saturday morning, we told visiting fans you should go to College Football Playoff Media Day at the Amalie Arena and then walk the Riverwalk down to the convention center to Playoff Fan Central and walk the Riverwalk to ... Curtis Hixon Park. And, they actually did it. \" Along the Riverwalk outside the convention center, a yacht village was set up with 20 vessels that Higgins called \"a blueprint for future major events.\" Additionally, Clearwater held the football Championship Beach Bash the day before the big game. Higgins said all those events that weekend \"gave a whole new perspective\" to those who had not been in Tampa since the Super Bowl in 2009 or the Republican National Convention in 2012. In fact, Tampa International Airport saw a record number of passengers, with Delta Airlines providing 10 extra flights, and more than 200 corporate jets landing. Higgins also noted that his colleagues had to scramble when it came to giving the visiting college football teams the red carpet treatment when they landed. A few days before the players flew in, a playoff staffer turned to Higgins and said, \"you should really get an orange carpet\" for Clemson, to acknowledge the team's colors. Higgins did just that. The same staffer later said to him when it came to Alabama: \"Just a heads up. Red isn't crimson.\" In a last-minute effort, Higgins got a crimson carpet. ”We had both team colors there,” he said. Right now, the Tampa Bay Sports Commission is attempting to attract several athletic events, including bringing back the college football championship a second time, and it is currently in the NCAA bid process, Higgins said.
