In pictures - Standing Rock protests \nMorton County Sheriff's Office spokesman Rob Keller said the latest arrests were made after demonstrators moved from their existing camp on flood-prone ground to land owned by the pipeline company, Energy Transfer Partners. \nHe said no injuries had been reported during the operation. Protest leaders could not be reached for comment. \nThe $3.7bn (Â£2.8bn) pipeline is designed to transport about 470,000 barrels of crude oil a day across four states, from North Dakota to a terminal in Illinois, where it can be shipped to refineries. \nThe US Army Corps of Engineers, which has approval authority, decided last year to explore other routes for the pipeline amid huge protests by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. \nBut earlier this week, acting Secretary of the Army Robert Speer ordered the corps to allow the work to go ahead. \nPresident Donald Trump recently signed an executive order signalling his support for the pipeline.
