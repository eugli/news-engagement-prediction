These days that relationship has taken a decidedly modern spin, with donation-matching offers from Sia and Grimes in the thousands of dollars, and stars using social media to speak out about the causes they believe in. And today the online music marketplace Bandcamp has pledged to donate 100 percent of its share of proceeds from sales to the American Civil Liberties Union in response to Donald Trump’s executive order temporarily barring refugees as well as citizens from seven Middle Eastern countries. “It is an unequivocal moral wrong, a cynical attempt to sow division among the American people, and is in direct opposition to the principles of a country where the tenet of religious freedom is written directly into the Constitution,” writes Bandcamp founder and CEO Ethan Diamond in an open letter on the site. “I am the descendant of immigrants—my great-grandparents came to America from Russia and Lithuania as teenagers and worked in sweatshops until they were able to afford to bring the rest of their families over. Most everyone you speak to in this country has a similar story to tell, because we are, in fact, a nation of immigrants, bound together by a shared belief in justice, equality, and the freedom to pursue a better life.” In addition to the donations made to the ACLU, Bandcamp compiled a list of albums created by artists from countries affected by the immigration ban and other recent executive actions, from Mexico to Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Yemen, Libya, and Somalia, in the hope that, as Diamond writes, “as you listen to these albums, you’ll not only discover some great new artists, but will also gain a further appreciation and understanding for the way music transcends all borders, and remember that, even in the darkest of times, there is more that unites us than divides us.” So go ahead—buy some new music, expand your mind. The results might surprise you. In This Story: Politics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T22:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T20:06:24.190+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
