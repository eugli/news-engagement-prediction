Models dial up the Plasticine charm with bouffants or doll lashes, but the designer’s eye for theatricality isn’t relegated to the runway. Whether filling the front row (as at tonight’s Fall 2017 show) or sparking double takes on the red carpet, his coterie of offbeat beauty muses illustrates that more is definitely more. If the DNA of a Scott favorite is a certain fluoro-bright magnetism, Miley Cyrus is one shining example, with the confidence (and color fidelity) to combine a baby-pink braided topknot, lipstick the shade of bubble gum, and a bikini layered with breezy mesh coverups. Fellow singer-songwriter Katy Perry—a beauty chameleon in her own right—puts the la garçonne look into overdrive with a ’60s-inspired coif and serious décolletage. And K-Pop star CL’s screen-siren-red lips and heavily lined eyes, partially obscured behind an asymmetrical swoop of silver hair, call to mind Old Hollywood—only with a stole of mass-produced teddy bears where the mink would be. Taking a page from these nine Moschino stars isn’t about adopting any one element; let Paris Hilton relish her own blonde pageant curls. Here, the message of playful individualism and twisted glamour offers a chance for reinvention. The game of risk and reward starts now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:56:12.360+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
