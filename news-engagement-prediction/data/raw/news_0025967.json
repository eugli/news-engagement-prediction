Crean went crashing to the hardwood, and Wagner almost tripped over him, too. Unfortunately for Indiana, that wasn't the only bad part of the first half, as Michigan led 35-25 at the intermission. The Wolverines went on to win 75-63. \nCrean appeared to be okay for the rest of the game, but his body might be sore later.
