Others are obscure to most Americans. All we can do is look to their backgrounds for clues. \nWith the Obama administration, we spent the last eight years suffering from the elevation of Ben Rhodes — a thirtysomething novelist with no foreign or security policy experience who, nonetheless, made foreign policy. With the Trump administration, we have Steve Bannon, whose extensive writing and speaking USA TODAY just exhaustively investigated only to find nothing. Which one is worse? \nFailure to understand American fears outside the Beltway and Hollywood, despite the fact that an element of Islam has declared war on Western civilization, has led to a reality that the entire West is endangered, including Western Muslims. \nSince 9/11, two administrations told the public, “Islam is peace.” President Obama refused to even acknowledge that Islam, which means “submission” or “surrender,” has anything to do with the wave of Muslim-perpetrated terrorism in Europe and creeping its way into the United States. \nThe Trump administration and Bannon do not mince words. And the fact that terrorism is uppermost on so many Americans’ minds indicates a compelling vote of confidence for Bannon and President Trump, although one would be hard-pressed to read that in the news media. What Bannon shares with ISIL leader: Our view \nBannon has been chided for voicing concerns over immigration from Muslim-majority countries. He argues that sharia, or Islamic religious law, is not compatible with liberal democracies. That is indisputable. His detractors paint him as an intolerant boogeyman, when it’s the intolerance of sharia law that concerns him. \nMuch of Bannon’s work with Breitbart , especially since he hired Muslim journalist Raheem Kassam to run its London operations, has given him a courtside view of the terror that Islamic immigrants have wrought upon Europe. Bannon brings to the White House a fresh, pragmatic perspective that might just save the lives of American Christians, Jews — and Muslims. \nPaul Miller is president and executive director of the think tank Haym Salomon Center.
