Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThe eagerly-anticipated final series of Broadchurch started tonight with a chilling new case for detectives Hardy and Miller to investigate. \nDavid Tennant and Olivia Coleman returned to our screens for the new series that picks up three years after the end of series two. \nHardy and Miller began their hunt to find the culprit of a serious sexual assault. \nAnd viewers were completely gripped from the outset. \nViewers were thrown straight into the action as farm shop worker Trish Winterman, played by former Coronation Street favourite Julie Hesmondhalgh, was met at the harbour by Miller to reveal details of her horrifying attack. \nIt was quickly discovered that Trish’s terrifying ordeal took place at the birthday party of her friend Cath (Sarah Parish), who started to question the involvement of her husband Jim who runs a local garage. \nTrish claimed to have been attacked from behind by a mystery male predator, leaving a long list of suspects for the detectives to interview and eliminate.

Trish is the victim of sexual assault (Photo: ITV) \nOther new cast members include Georgina Campbell as an opinionated and ambitious young detective and funnyman Charlie Higson in an unfamiliar dramatic role as Trish’s estranged husband Ian, who recently left her for another woman. \nReverend Paul Coates (Arthur Darvill) is back to provide more support alongside Danny Latimer’s grieving mother Beth (Jodie Whittaker), who saw Joe Miller acquitted of her son's murder in series two. \n*Broadchurch continues on ITV next Monday at 9pm.
