Tyler Cavanaugh added 21 points and 13 rebounds for the Colonials (15-13, 7-8 Atlantic 10). \nGeorge Washington shot 53.4 percent from the field and dominated the glass, winning 41-29 on the boards. \nZach Lewis led UMass (13-15, 3-12) with 16 points. The Minutemen shot 26 3-pointers in the game, hitting just six. The loss drops UMass into the bottom four in the 14-team Atlantic 10 standings. Only the top 10 clinch first-round byes in the conference tourney which begins on March 8. \nGeorge Washington trailed 40-38 at the break, but seized the lead for good midway through the second half on a Jordan Roland jumper which was part of an 18-2 Colonials run. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.
