MORNING REPORT/RNZ \nA Child Youth and Family manager admits the agency failed multiple times when it sent a Southland toddler back into a P-using household where he died. \nIn its file on the family, the agency said both the toddler and his three-year-old sister were \"unsafe\", but allowed him to return home, where he died five days later. \nREAD MORE: MORNING REPORT/RNZ \nThe aunt of a toddler who died on Child Youth and Family's watch has released a recording she secretly made of a meeting with a CYF manager in which the agency acknowledges failings. \nAll of the identities in the case have been permanently suppressed. \nBetween March and August last year, CYF carried out a review of its handling of the case, and a manager met with the boy's family in September. \nThe family secretly recorded the meeting, and provided the recording to RNZ . \nDuring the meeting, the CYF representative said no one could have predicted the toddler's death, despite the agency's repeated involvement in the family. \nShe admitted multiple errors had been made, but maintained the agency had fulfilled its statutory obligations. \nVIOLENT MAN ALLOWED HOME \nIn 2015, while facing multiple violence charges, the mother's boyfriend was granted electronic bail on the condition he not live at the family's home or be unsupervised around children. \nWhen he later sought to return home, a judge asked CYF to assess the risk to the woman's children. \nThat request had been misunderstood and the subsequent report was \"poor ... not one of our best\", the manager told the boy's family. \n\"The information that was given to the judge didn't actually concentrate and focus on the issues that we know that were happening in the home ... The report wasn't perhaps as robust or as critical as we would have wanted,\" she said, according to RNZ. \nThe man was allowed to return to the family home around late September or early October of 2015, with a CYF safety plan in place for the family - albeit one that the manager later admitted was insufficient and not adhered to. \nIn October, the boy was taken to hospital with a broken leg and multiple other injuries. \nHis doctors, CYF and police were all concerned about his safety and that of his sister, who had been left at home with the man. \nHowever, the boy was discharged to go home. \nTODDLER'S DEATH \nAbout 5.30pm on October 12, 2015, the boy's mother texted her boyfriend to see the kids were doing. \nThe boy was unsettled and not sleeping, her boyfriend replied. \nThe mother suggested giving him milk. The boyfriend messaged her later saying he had given the toddler paracetamol and a drink of water. \nWhen the mother returned home later that evening, the man told her both children were asleep. \nThe next morning, she found her son dead. \nAn autopsy revealed bruises to the boy's left eye and the right side of his forehead. He had suffered a blow to the back of the head and spinal injuries. \nWhen first questioned, the mother's boyfriend said the boy had been fine when he went to bed. \nBut confronted with the autopsy results, the man said he was walking in the backyard and tripped over a skateboard, falling on top of the child. The child was initially upset, but began playing again, he claimed. \nThe man was later charged with murder, but was found dead in prison after a suspected suicide the following month. \nThe woman's daughter was later taken out of her care . \nA LITANY OF ERRORS \nIn the meeting with the toddler's family, the CYF manager was unable to explain why he was discharged from hospital back to the home where his injuries were believed to have occurred. \nAs well as an insufficiently strong safety plan, the manager admitted the agency had not explored other options for the boy's discharge, like placing him in care, and said social workers did not give enough consideration to warnings about the boyfriend, or ask tough questions of the family, RNZ reported. \nSocial workers weren't sure they needed to be concerned about the cause of his injuries, she said. \n\"I suppose, again, if we look at it with the benefit of hindsight, we were thinking, yeah, we probably should have been more worried.\" \nCYF urged RNZ not to broadcast the recording, saying it would undermine public trust in the agency and \"impede our ability to do our job of keeping children and young people safe\". \nThe boy's family disagreed. \nThey told RNZ they doubted CYF had learnt from its mistakes, or that it would make the necessary changes. \n\"You still have the same staff, you still have problems with under-resourcing, problems with your staff not being trained properly,\" the boy's aunt said. \n\"This agency has processes in place that they admitted to us were not followed.\" \nAn inquest into the boy's death was expected to take place later this year. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T03:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:10:23.552+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
