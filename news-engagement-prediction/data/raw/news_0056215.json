At the Vanity Fair Young Hollywood party , Dakota took things to another level of cool: black, peek-a-boo lace. It's beyond. \nDakota's partially see-through dress is by Dior (love!), and our Anastasia Steele told TWD : \"I'm wearing it because it kind of looks like a sexual-like flamenco dancer.\" Fierce. \nMore from CafeMom: Jamie Dornan & Amelia Warner Look Smitten on BAFTAs Red Carpet \nWe love the vibe. This dress would be perfect to wear to a friend's wedding or a super fancy night out to dinner with your sweetheart. There is a bit of a vintage nod to it thanks to those tassels, and it's sexy without being over the top. It's totally Dakota. The night was a big one for the Fifty Shades Darker star. She was one of the cohosts for the event, along with Krista Smith, the executive West Coast editor of Vanity Fair . \nDakota has a very distinct style, and though the clothes she wears for events vary in design, they all have one thing in common -- they are wearable, and never does she look uncomfortable in them. She wears the clothes; the clothes do not wear her. And every time, she inspires us.
