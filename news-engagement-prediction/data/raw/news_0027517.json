Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield (Photo: Rex Features) \nAndrew - who gave Emma a standing ovation as she picked up a Golden Globe award earlier this year - said: \"I'm her biggest fan as an artist. I'm constantly inspired by her work. I'm constantly inspired by how she handles and holds herself. \n\"So, for me it's been bliss to be able to watch her success and watch her bloom into the actress she is.\" \nAnd the Hacksaw Ridge star admits there is still an \"unconditional\" bond between himself and the 28-year-old beauty.

It's also been wonderful to have that kind of support for each other. \n\"It's nothing but a beautiful thing.\" \nOn Saturday night, the pair were joined by a host of other famous faces.
