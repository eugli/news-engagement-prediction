Speaking to reporters on Friday, Baillie said a court battle would cost taxpayers “millions” and he’d “rather see that money go into classrooms.” \nBut threats of legal action are not a reason to back down McNeil said Friday. \n“We can’t just say every time someone is going to disagree with us, then lets just give in,” he said. “We believe very strongly that this will withstand a court challenge.” Liberals considering one amendment from NDP \nMcNeil hasn’t yet ruled out all proposed amendments to Bill 75. \nNDP MLA Dave Wilson is proposing that the bill allow for an independent arbitrator on the working conditions committee. The arbitrator would have the power to decide on issues that the different groups on the committee can’t agree on. \nThe third tentative agreement that teachers rejected included an arbitration option, but it limited the amount of money that an arbitrator could decide on. The money limit wasn’t in Wilson’s proposed amendment. \nMcNeil said his government will consider accepting the amendment if the New Democrats agree to a budget limit. \nThe Progressive Conservatives said they aren’t proposing any amendments to the bill because they believe it shouldn’t be on the table at all. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
