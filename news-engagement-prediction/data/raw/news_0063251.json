He was just 27. Habberstad was working right up until last year, and boasted over 50 movie credits, including ‘Star Trek Into Darkness’, ‘American Sniper’, ‘Ant-Man’, ‘Iron Man 3’ and ‘The Dark Knight Rises’. But after complaining of stomach pains following a movie job in Hawaii, he was diagnosed with gastric cancer, which eventually spread to his brain. His father, Jeff Habberstad, himself a veteran second unit director and stunt coordinator, said in a heartbreaking post on Instagram: “My biggest fear in life would be to outlive my child. That nightmare has happened. “I spent over 8 months watching my first-born son Trevor fight this horrible rare disease. He never complained once, never said ‘why me,’ never gave up, never lost hope, never considered losing as an option. “But that disease was relentless. Every time he would start to make a gain, it would change direction and punch him in the gut. And he would get back up and lead the new charge. I am so proud. I don’t know how I can live without him, work without him, play without him. “I miss him so much.” ‘X-Men’ director Bryan Singer also paid tribute to him with his own post on Instagram. “His skill, commitment to safety, and work ethic was second to none. In my 20 year career I have never lost a friend/colleague this way,” he said. “He and his entire family are among the kindest people I have ever met. My heart goes out to them.” Read more: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T15:49:11.940+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
