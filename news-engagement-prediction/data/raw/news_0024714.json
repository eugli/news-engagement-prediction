'It's opened a lot of doors': Ray Traplin \nRay Traplin is from far north Queensland and is part of the Kuku Yalanji mob. \nCurrently living in Melbourne, Traplin was recently released from prison and is exhibiting a piece in the Confined 8 exhibition.

It's opened a lot of doors for me,\" Traplin said. 'Living the dream': Robby Wirramanda \nRobby Wirramanda is from Wergaia/Wotjobaluk country, in north-west Victoria, and was released from prison two years ago. \nWhile he was an established artist before being incarcerated, the Torch program allowed him to sell his artwork while serving his sentence. \n\"I've been an artist since before I can remember, creating things with my grandmother,\" he said. \nHe boasted that his artwork in the Confined 8 exhibition sold before opening night. \n\"Both sold. They always sell — guaranteed, every time,\" he said. \nIn Melbourne, Wirramanda ran mixed martial arts fights; now, he lives with his family in the bush near Swan Hill — and says he understands what \"living the dream\" really means. \nWirramanda puts his drastic lifestyle change down to a change in environment. \n\"I made some wrong choices at the time. I was trying to achieve too many things, too quickly and when you take shortcuts that's what happens,\" he said. \n\"In the art world it's a totally different environment, surrounded by great people. \n\"Like chalk and cheese, those two environments. It's definitely a different path.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T07:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T03:12:11.209+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
