View gallery \nKieron says: “David was great in helping me to get fit, but I was not helping myself by going to McDonald’s and eating lots of unhealthy food. \n“He helped me to realise that you have to get your nutrition right to get the results you want, and I’ll admit my motivation for starting the fitness drive was seeing all those pictures on Instagram of guys looking muscular and thinking why don’t I look like that? \n“I’d heard there were places in Manchester doing this kind of food, but for me that’s a bit of a drive into the city, as there’s nothing around here like that. \n“Monton is getting quite saturated now with restaurants and cafes so Walkden seemed like the next up and coming place, especially with the new shopping centre here.” \nAnd as for the name of the cafe? Kieron admits the cheeky double meaning of Strip appealed to him. He laughs: “It’s Strip as in clean eating, and stripping back to good health. And a cheeky little play on the word too!” Kieron Richardson joined by Hollyoaks stars (left to right) Kirsty Leigh Porter, Steph Waring, Jazz Franks, Jessica Fox and Duncan James as he launches Strip Health Cafe in Walkden (Photo: Manchester Evening News) \nHe designed all the interiors for the cafe, with the aim of “bringing the outside in” with green turf and wooden panels on the walls. \nIt comes amid a busy time for Kieron, who has some explosive storylines on the way as Ste Hay on Hollyoaks, and of course he is excitedly awaiting the arrival of his baby twins with husband Carl after their IVF treatment with a surrogate mother was a success.

We grew up with fish and chips, yes it’s brilliant and as popular as ever, but this is the new thing to jump on.” \nAnd we can’t help but notice that there seems to be a bit of a trend emerging for Hollyoaks stars to diversify in the restaurant world - with Ashley Taylor-Dawson launching his cocktail bar and music venue Elysium in Wilmslow, while ex-Hollyoaks star Rob Norbury is having big success in Uppermill with his Muse restaurant.
