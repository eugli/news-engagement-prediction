According to Philippine Star, the actress, who stars as the betrayed wife in \"Ika-6 na Utos\", stated that she has received a lot of personal messages from women who enjoyed the show and had faced similar situations in life. \"Sometimes, it's heartbreaking to read their stories. There are so many women who are suffering silently. But if my story helps them in any way, if it gives them hope, then I'm okay with that,\" she said. Dizon herself is no stranger to marital woes. Last year, she left her husband, Timothy Tan after finding out that he had an affair with another woman. However, according to Dizon, she is less aggressive than her character, since she had since dropped charges against her husband, and accepted his apology back in December last year. \"It was a hard and painful decision to make, but I still have two kids who need their father. I had to make that choice for them,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T10:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:29:24.631+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
