So what's next for Chelsea? She's still taking some time to figure that out, per an aide. Clinton, who completed a PhD in international relations from Oxford in 2014, has a book out Thursday with co-author Devi Sridhar called \"Governing Global Health: Who Runs the World and Why?\" building on her PhD work. But don't expect a book tour -- it's geared toward an academic crowd, published by Oxford University Press. She will continue her work as vice chair of the board at the Clinton Global Initiative. She's also the mother of two young children -- son Aidan, now seven months old, was born in June. Daughter Charlotte is nearly 2 1/2 years old. In the meantime, keep an eye on her tweets.
