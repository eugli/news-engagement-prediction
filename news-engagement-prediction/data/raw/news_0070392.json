In Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey's relatively recent history, animal activists including PETA have lined up outside the Big Top holding signs and dispersing information regarding treatment of the circus' elephants, tigers, lions and other animal performers.\nRingling Bros. stopped using Asian elephants in May 2016, and acknowledged the drastic drop in already-declining ticket sales is one reason the traveling troupe will end its 146-year run this year.\nHere's a look at some of the circus' protesters through the years.

While in transit, the animals are confined to boxcars, trailers, or trucks, where they may not have access to basic necessities, such as food, water, and veterinary care. Elephants are chained, and big cats are imprisoned in cramped, filthy cages, in which they eat, drink, sleep, defecate, and urinate?all in the same place. And there?s no relief once the animals reach a venue, where they remain caged and are chained in arena basements and parking lots.\n(Credit: Katie Arth, Los Angeles) reader photos Katie Arth, Los Angeles Robbyn Taylor, along with other protesters, take part in a demonstration in 2010 in Washington DC.\n(Credit: Emily Rohr from Lexington, Kentu) reader photos Emily Rohr from Lexington, Kentu A teen poses at a PETA protest against Ringling Brothers Circus outside the Staples Center in Los Angles.\n(Credit: Maura McKeon, Allentown, PA) reader photos Maura McKeon, Allentown, PA Local activists protesting Ringling's animal abuse.\n(Credit: Molly Nicoletta, Seattle WA) reader photos Molly Nicoletta, Seattle WA My daughter and her friend at the Ringling Brother's circus...they decided not to go in because of the cruelty.\n(Credit: Unsure) reader photos Unsure Circus protest in Norfolk, VA\n(Credit: Passerby) reader photos Passerby Stacie, Sheila , Jenny and Marlena protesting in fort smith Arkansas\n(Credit: unsure) reader photos unsure Circus protest\n(Credit: Allstate Arena) reader photos Allstate Arena 3 generations of family doing outreach to others about the lives of animals in Ringling Brothers circus.
