Article continues below \nOf course, it isn't the first time the Gunners have put in a below-par display in Europe and their opponents last week have been basking in the glory of the result ever since. \nEven before a ball had been kicked in the tie, Bayern's official social media accounts were taking every opportunity to troll the Premier League side - such was their confidence. Article continues below \nAnd now even one of their star men has aimed a jibe at Arsenal for their poor showing last week. \nAfter beating Wenger's side, Bayern returned to Bundesliga action on Saturday and faced Hertha Berlin. \nUnlike their previous match, however, they were pushed to the limit against the sixth-placed Hertha and required a 96th-minute equaliser from Robert Lewandowski to salvage a 1-1 draw. \nOn Sunday, the German champions' goalkeeper Manuel Neuer posted his reaction to the game on his official Facebook page. \nIn English, it translates to: \"After the holiday last Wednesday, yesterday was a hard day at work again.\" \nOuch. \nDuring the Arsenal clash, Neuer wasn't completely surplus to requirements as he saved Alexis Sanchez's penalty, only to see the Chilean convert the rebound. \nNevertheless, it is a stinging indictment on the Gunners from the German No.1. \nSanchez and co. will get the chance to salvage some pride when the two teams meet for the second leg on March 7 but even Arsenal fans will probably admit there is little chance of their side overturning the 5-1 deficit. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
