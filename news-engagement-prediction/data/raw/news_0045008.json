The tool connects to influencers’ YouTube, Instagram, Twitch and Twitter accounts to find matches. \nHere’s a GIF to show how it works: Search for social influencers who post images similar to what your brand is looking for. Dovetale \n“Influencer marketing is at a standstill—the marketplace platforms that exist are not targeted and optimized to help brands succeed,” said Dovetale’s founder, Mike Schmidt, in a press release. “We have developed a true technology platform that brings back the strategy, accountability and trust in influencer marketing.” \n“Dovetale helps educate brands during the process, while making it easy to see the direct impact influencer marketing has on their campaigns, so they can eventually own their influencer marketing strategy,” said Schmidt. \nIn addition to this new tool, brands and agencies who use Dovetale will also have access to its already existing suite of tools, which includes a payment structure (that uses Stripe), measurement and analytics capabilities, and other features that help further discovery of new influencers.
