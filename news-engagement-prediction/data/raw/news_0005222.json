Nova Scotia’s Shubenacadie Sam emerged from his small barn this morning and officials declared that the groundhog did not see his shadow in the first of many such weather predictions being made today in North America.\nChildren gathered around the pen as the rodent scurried into a snowy yard, hiding behind a promotional banner for the annual event.\nFolklore has it that if the groundhog sees its shadow when it emerges from its burrow on Groundhog Day, there will be six more weeks of winter. If the groundhog doesn’t see its shadow, then tradition says spring is on the way.\nThousands across the country are expected to turn to four-legged forecasters, like Sam and Wiarton Willie, to learn if spring is just around the corner.\n  In Wiarton, Ont., the festival leading up to this morning’s “official prediction” by the town’s albino groundhog — Willie — began on Jan. 27.\nIn Pennsylvania, it will be the 131st Groundhog Day at Gobbler’s Knob as Punxsutawney Phil reveals his prediction to the president of the Inner Circle of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T15:45:24.273+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
