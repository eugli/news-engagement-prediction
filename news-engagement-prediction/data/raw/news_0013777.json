So far, he has served his sentence. \n“Now he is free as he has already been charged and served his sentence. \n“So he is coming back as a normal person.” \nJailed for 24 years in a Canadian prison for sexually assaulting do­zens of women in Toronto, Selva Kumar, who is from Penang, has fought long and hard against his deportation. \nHe has even gone to the extent of claiming that he would be a victim of discrimination in Malaysia because he is “Jewish” and tried to block a newspaper in Toronto from publishing his picture. \nHe reportedly went to Canada as a student in 1980 and his visa was extended after he was sponsored by a spouse. \nHowever, it was reported that during a parole board meeting last week, he said he had a “structured release plan” for his freedom in Malaysia as well as “strong family support”. \nHe was said to be from “an affluent family”. \nThe Star reported a former neighbour of Selva Kumar as saying that he was from a family of educationists, his late father being a senior education officer with the Penang Education Department and his late brother was a teacher at a primary school in the state. \nThe third of four siblings – he has two older brothers and a younger sister – Selva Kumar is a former Penang Free School boy. \nAnother relative said the father died years ago and his mother “is very sickly and being taken care of by a sister”. \nHis impending return has sparked concerns from the public here, with calls for him to be listed in a national registry of sex offen­", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T03:29:33.556+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
