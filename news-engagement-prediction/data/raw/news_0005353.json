The actor recently shared his new look for his upcoming film – Vikram Veda and captioned it – Losing it bit by bit. While he is talking of the oodles of weight he has lost, the caption sort of reflects our state of mind. We are going to lose it bit by bit each other time he shares his lean, mean sexy avatar for this gangsta thriller film with Vijay Sethupathi . In an all black ensemble, sporting a slight stubble and moustache and a fitter frame, Madhavan has our full attention. Yet again he has proven, he’s is a rare combination of charm, goofiness and hotness. Vijay Sethupathi’s look for this movie is also impressive. He has bulked up and grown a salt n pepper full beard. Looks like, Vikram Veda is not only going to be an exciting project but also a feast for your eyes, courtesy, Madhavan and Vijay. The film is reportedly a modern take on the mythological tale – Vikram Aditya. Vijay plays a gangsta and Madhavan plays a cop. The film also stars Shraddha Srinath and Varu Sarath.
