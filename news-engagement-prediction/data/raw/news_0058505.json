That helped us zero in on youngsters with similar hair styles,” a senior investigator told HT. \nLocals in Arjun Nagar, barely two kilometers from the crime spot, said police teams had visited them and asked about all boys with dyed hair. Once the boy was traced, he was shown the sketch of the accused and he revealed his friend’s identity. \n“Despite the shock, the victim was strong and helped identify the accused. She was able to give a clear description of the accused,” said RP Upadhyay, Joint CP (South-Eastern Range). \nRaja, who was thrown out by his mother a few months ago, had not returned home after the crime. “Since we knew Raja had very little money, we were certain it would be difficult for him to leave the city,” said an investigator. \nThe police launched a combing operation in Arjun Nagar and nearby localities after the crime was reported, said Ishwar Singh, DCP (South).

He was in the same clothes that he wore at the time of the crime. A head injury, inflicted by the victim with a stone in her attempt to fight him, confirmed he was the same man. \n“We recovered the victim’s iphone from him and Rs 450 of the Rs 600 he had stolen from her purse,” said the DCP. Police claimed blood from Raja’s injured head was found on the victim’s clothes. \nThese and some other crucial evidence were strong enough to nail the accused, said the DCP. “We will chargesheet him within a month,” Singh told HT. \nRead more: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T14:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:11:42.178+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
