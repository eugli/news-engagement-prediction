(AP Photo/Stephen Brashear) (Stephen Brashear) comments \nHOUSTON -- Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins was named the recipient of the NFLPA Byron Whizzer White Man of The Year Award on Thursday. \nJenkins beat out fellow finalist for the award Giants running back Rashad Jennings for the NFLPA's charitable honor , in which every team in the NFL nominates a player for consideration. \nThe Byron Whizzer White Award is the NFLPA's Man of The Year Award presented annually since 1997 to the player who best represented his team by providing service in his community, nation and world. \nJenkins took on an expanded social advocacy role this season against police brutality and has been one of the more active members of the Eagles in terms of fostering better relations between minority communities and law enforcement in what was a tumultuous year across the nation in 2016. \nJenkins was among several NFL players who visited Capitol Hill in November to meet with House Speaker Paul Ryan and various members of Congress to begin an open dialogue about police brutality and race relations. \n\"I'd like to thank the NFLPA for such a prestigious award,\" Jenkins said after receiving the award following a press conference held by the union at the George R. Brown Convention Center. \"When you talk about the former players that have won this award and came before us, it's an honor to be mentioned alongside of them. I'm proud to be able to stand out among a league of men who do so much work to impact their own communities.\" \nAlong with the award, the NFLPA donated $100 thousand to the Malcolm Jenkins Foundation. \nMatt Lombardo may be reached at .
