The previous record for that day was set in 2011 at 10.8 C. \nKidd says Windsor, Ont., was the hot spot in the province that day, with temperatures reaching 19.1 C, beating the previous record set in 2011 by nearly 7 C. \nShe says Saturday's record-breaking temperatures stretched from Windsor all the way to to Bancroft, Ont., and as far north as Sudbury, North Bay and Thunder Bay. \nThe balmy weather is expected to last Sunday, with the high in Toronto expecting to reach 11 C. Kidd says the record temperature for Feb. 19 in Toronto is 12.5 C, but she says there is still the potential to beat it. \nShe adds that Windsor has a better chance of breaking its temperature record. Sunday's forecast is a high of 14 C, and the record set last year was 14.4 C. \nMore sunny days are ahead for southwestern Ontario, except for Tuesday when some showers are in the forecast. \nBut hang on to those winter jackets, Kidd warns, winter isn't over yet. Rain, and possibly some snow, could arrive by next weekend. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T20:00:28.753+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
