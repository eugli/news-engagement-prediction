Nitish has claimed that he is the boss of the show that he is running in Bihar. By: FE Online | Bihar | Published: February 5, 2017 12:00 PM Giriraj Singh (PTI) \nPolitics in Bihar is heating up again in Bihar where allies Janata Dal (United) under Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad Yadav ’s Rashtriya Janata Dal are running the government. The problem with the entire state of affairs is that Lalu does not like to play second fiddle to anyone and Nitish himself has shown that he prefers to act alone rather than taking others with him. While he ran the government smoothly the last time he formed the government with his previous ally the Bharatiya Janata Party (he gave the Dy chief ministership to its leader Shushil Modi). This time he has made Tejaswi Yadav (Lalu’s son dy CM). Ostensibly all is well as in public no one is willing to take antagonistic stands. But in the last assembly elections, Lalu’s RJD became the single largest party after winning 80 seats, Nitish and Sharad Pawar’s JD (U) with 71 seats and BJP won 53 seats. Nitish as such is beholden to Lalu and has a weaker hold on the state. Needless to say, the tussle for supremacy has been going on for long. \nConsidering that the setback was massive for the Narendra Modi led BJP – unlike in previous elections that most predicted Modi may well lose, this one had been forecast as a BJP win. Voters proved everyone wrong again. The loss was huge for BJP. The BJP has been taking potshots at its former ally Nitish Kumar ever since for being remote-controlled by Lalu. Nitish has claimed that he is the boss of the show that he is running in Bihar. But the latest one to challenge that is BJP senior leader Giriraj Singh. Taking a dig at Nitish’ frequent signalling of independence in running his government, the BJP leader said, “Wo (Nitish) apni rajnetik rang bhar rahe thay, Laluji ko baar baar wo zaroor dikhaate rehte hain ki main swatantra hun.” (He has to show to show his political colour frequently. He keeps showing Lalu that he is completely independent.) \nYou May Also Like To Watch: \n\nThe war of taunts is entirely on BJP’s side. Nitish has gone out of his way to support the PM Narendra Modi government’s dispensatoion at the Centre. Tellingly, he was amongst the first to come out in support of the controversial demonetisation drive. Both Modi and Nitish have greeted each other warmly whenever they meet. In fact, just today, at a public meet, Nitish caused quite a political flutter by colouring a lotus (party symbol of the BJP). This was unlike the time before the 2015 assembly election when Nitish would get furious if anyone reminded him of the fact that he had shaken Narendra Modi’s hand and shared the dais with him a long time ago. While Modi has been quite effusive in his praise of Nitish, the state BJP on the hand hand has not – the latest taunt signals the fact that they are yet to come to terms with the loss. For Nitish, the options are quite limited with Lalu acting coy about his intentions.
