For writers who aren’t inspired by incredible natural vistas, though, there are other options. Like, for instance, spending five days inside the Mall of America . \nIn honor of the 25th anniversary of the opening of the country’s biggest mall , the Mall of America is looking for a writer-in-residence . According to the Mall: \n\"The Writer-in-Residence Contest will give a special scribe the chance to spend five days deeply immersed in the Mall atmosphere while writing on-the-fly impressions in their own words. The contest winner will stay in an attached hotel for four nights, receive a $400 gift card to buy food and drinks, and collect a generous honorarium for the sweat and tears they’ll put into their prose.\" \nThe winner will spend every day from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the mall, working from his or her assigned desk for at least four hours a day. Bill Pugliano/Liaison \nThe work of the writer-in-residence will be submitted to a mall representative at least three times a day, and approved musings will appear on a large monitor in the writer’s workspace. In return for their labor, in addition to the lodging and food allowance, the chosen wordsmith will get a $2500 honorarium. \nHopeful chroniclers of mall life will need to submit a 150-word pitch describing how they would approach their time as writer-in-residence. Twenty-five of those applicants will make it on to the next stage of the contest and will submit a 500- to 800-word essay about their story idea. \nApply here if dining on Wetzel's Pretzels and writing odes to flash sales is your idea of literary heaven.
