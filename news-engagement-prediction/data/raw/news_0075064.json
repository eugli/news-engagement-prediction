The only question is, who will that quarterback be? \nGeneral manager John Elway has said the team will have an open competition between Trevor Siemian and Paxton Lynch this offseason, but he also hasn’t ruled out the possibility of bringing in a high-profile quarterback such as Tony Romo. \nWhile teams wait for the Cowboys to make a decision on Romo, fans and pundits have been speculating where the veteran will land. Siemian, who was the team’s starter in 2016, is well aware of the speculation. \n“It doesn’t [bother me],” Siemian told Mike Florio of Pro Football Talk earlier this month. “I’m sure we’re going to get another quarterback — I don’t know who it’ll be — [but] there’s only two of us now.” \nIf the team decides against pursuing Romo, there will be other veteran options to consider, including Josh McCown. \n“If I’m a back up, I’d like to go somewhere where I can really mentor a young QB and work with him to make him better,” McCown recently said on SiriusXM Radio. \nThat’s exactly the kind of scenario McCown would find in Denver. (The Cowboys have a similar scenario with Dak Prescott.) \nIf the Broncos go with Siemian (or Lynch) in 2017, they would be wise to have a more experienced quarterback on the roster to help develop the young starter. \nMcCown, 37, entered the NFL as a third-round pick out of Sam Houston State with the Cardinals in 2002. Since then, he has spent time with nine NFL teams, most recently starting three games with the Browns last season. He owns 79 career touchdown passes against 69 interceptions. \nFew teams would bring McCown in to be a starter, but Denver could use him as a veteran backup in 2017.
