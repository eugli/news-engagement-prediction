Slot to Georgia Links \nGeorgia won a showdown with Alabama on January 1 when four-star safety Deangelo Gibbs committed to the Bulldogs at the Under Armour All-American game. According to the 6-foot-2, 200-pound prospect, UGA fans may have J.R. Reed to thank for that. \nReed, Gibbs' first cousin, made the move from Tulsa to UGA last summer and sat out the 2016 season. During that time he practiced with the team but primarily served on the scout team. Every time Gibbs would make the trip to Athens -- and that was a lot -- Reed would be there, creating a family reunion of sorts. (Photo: Brian Perroni, 247Sports) \nWhen the decision became tough, it gave the Bulldogs a much-needed boost for the nation's 49th overall prospect according to the industry-generated 247Sports Composite. \n“He was a big part of my decision,\" Gibbs said of Reed. \"I’ve always wanted to play with my family.\" Not a member?

Every day, in fact, because now they are roommates. Reed now has the opportunity to show his younger cousin the ropes and what it's like to be a college athlete. \nAfter growing up together, the two are predictably happy with the way things are set up now. But they may not be quite as excited as the rest of their family, who can now travel to one city every Saturday to see them both play. \n\"It’s kind of like a family thing,\" Gibbs said. Our family can come to our game now and watch us both play. It’s pretty cool.” \n(What's next for the Bulldogs?
