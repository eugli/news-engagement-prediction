At least one of the men was reportedly infected with a highly contagious parasite, prompting police to summon an exterminator. \nClifton police were called to the store at the Riverfront shopping center around 5 p.m. Monday, according to The Record . The employee who made the call said he’d observed the two men committing a sex act on a display bed. \nThough the incident occured during business hours, it remains unclear if any shoppers witnessed it. The Clifton Police Department did not return calls for comment Friday. \nThe men, both 28 years old, face several charges, including lewdness, criminal mischief and possession of marijuana, The Record reported. \nAfter the men were transported to a booking station, authorities reportedly discovered at least one of the suspects had a secret surprise: scabies. \nThe arresting officers who were exposed to the highly contagious parasite, which burrows into human flesh and eats skin tissue, were reportedly treated at a local medical center. Police officials also ordered the fumigation of the department’s booking station. \nBecause of the exposure to scabies, authorities have declined to release the names of the two suspects, New Jersey On-Line reported. Authorities said doing so would violate the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. \nJessica Joyce, senior manager of Bed Bath & Beyond’s public relations department, told The Record the company found the incident “extremely upsetting.” \nThe store has removed the mattress due to possible contamination. \n“Out of an abundance of caution, the incident-related merchandise and display was immediately pulled from the floor and discarded,” she said.
