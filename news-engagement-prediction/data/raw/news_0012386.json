Then, in May of the same year, she went to the Greek island of Rhodes on a family holiday and found herself getting out of breath easily. 'The hotel we always stay at is up a hill. I've never had any problems before, but found myself wheezing and having to stop,' Ms Swain said. Her late-husband, Michael Power, who worked as a joiner for Manchester City Council in the 1970s, died from a brain disease in his early forties 'I knew then that something wasn't right.' Back home, she visited Rochdale Infirmary for an X-ray where she assumed it wouldn't be anything serious. I would shake the overalls before washing them and they would be heavy with dust â€“ so much so that it would cover the kitchen floor, and I'd have to sweep it up. I believe these were asbestos fibres Vivienne Swain, 60 But, after studying the scan, doctors admitted her as an emergency patient. They told her that it looked like a third of her lung had collapsed and asked her if she had suffered a fall or had knocked herself. However, she had no recollection of any such events and was transferred to Fairfield General Hospital in Bury. Over the next few months, she underwent a string of tests - but everything kept coming back negative. Then, after undergoing further testing at Wythenshawe Hospital she received her diagnosis three weeks later. 'I was told it was incurable, and a cold feeling went through my whole body,' she said. Previously fit and healthy, she began feeling wheezy in early 2015 - but thought it was because she was looking after a hamster at the time 'I didn't cry, I just launched into asking about treatment. I was on autopilot. I kept thinking about how I'd tell my sons Craig (43), Paul (39), and Todd (26).' 'I asked how long I had and was told, at best, three years. But I said to the doctors, 'I guarantee you I'll still be here in five.' I've got too much living left to do.' Following her heartbreaking diagnosis, Ms Swain was fitted with a pleural drain to help prevent a build up of fluid on her lungs. Her partner, Ian Johnston, 63, was taught how to drain it, which he had to do roughly every three to seven days. Next, she began chemotherapy, which she underwent every three weeks until October 2016. Now she is appealing for people to support her claims that she developed the disease through washing dust off Mr Power's clothes (pictured with her partner, Ian Johnston, 63) Doctors have since told her that her cancer was most likely caused by asbestos exposure, which she believes was through washing her late husband's clothing. WHAT IS MESOTHELIOMA? Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that develops in the lining that covers the outer surface of some of the body's organs. It's usually linked to asbestos exposure. Mesothelioma mainly affects the lining of the lungs (pleural mesothelioma), although it can also affect the lining of the tummy (peritoneal mesothelioma), heart or testicles. More than 2,600 people are diagnosed with the condition each year in the UK. Most cases are diagnosed in people aged 60-80 and men are affected more commonly than women. Unfortunately it's rarely possible to cure mesothelioma, although treatment can help control the symptoms. The symptoms of mesothelioma tend to develop gradually over time. They typically don't appear until several decades after exposure to asbestos. Mesothelioma is almost always caused by exposure to asbestos, a group of minerals made of microscopic fibres that used to be widely used in construction. These tiny fibres can easily get in the lungs, where they get stuck, damaging the lungs over time. It usually takes a while for this to cause any obvious problems, with mesothelioma typically developing more than 20 years after exposure to asbestos. The use of asbestos was completely banned in 1999, so the risk of exposure is much lower nowadays. However, materials containing asbestos are still found in many older buildings. Source: NHS Choices Following her diagnosis, she contacted specialist asbestos disease solicitors Thompsons in Manchester to investigate her case. Now, she is urging others who worked for Manchester City Council as joiners from 1969 to 1977 - particularly those that may have known her late husband - to come forward with information. Determined to carry on in the face of her devastating illness, she hopes compensation will help her fund treatments that aren't currently available on the NHS, but could potentially prolong her life. She is currently working closely with charity Mesothelioma UK, raising awareness of her type of cancer, and also praised Greater Manchester Asbestos Victim Support Group for the invaluable help they've given her since her diagnosis. They organised funding to help her, which she plans to repay if she gets compensation. She continued: 'I refuse to be defined by my illness. I've been given a sentence but I won't give in to it. 'I've kept very positive, and am surrounded by positive people. I'm not downbeat because there's nothing I can do about this. 'I'll just keep looking forward, keep making plans and spending time with my family. I never used to be one for having my picture taken but now I do it all the time because I'm determined to make memories.' A spokesperson for Manchester City Council said: 'It is always deeply regrettable when anybody has contracted mesothelioma or any other asbestos-related illness, but it would be inappropriate for us to comment on this case at the present time.'
