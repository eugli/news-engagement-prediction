Vitiligo occurs when cells stop producing pigment and affects 1 per cent of the world's population. The patches it creates differs in each case. Carlene said: 'My vitiligo goes around my eyes, a little on my nose and my little moustache on my upper lip. My whole one hand is almost white, both hands have a little bit on and there are two spots on my elbows. Tormented: Carlene, right, as a little girl with her twin sister Arlene. She was diagnosed with vetiligo aged 11 and faced years of bullying by children who didn't understand the condition Under the spotlight: Carlene with make up over her patches, left, and in a natural photo shoot 'At school I was called a lot of names like a \"cow\" and a \"Dalmatian dog\". Those words hit me hard. One time I was made fun of, I took a black pen and coloured in all of my vitiligo spots, sat there and cried. 'But I knew crying wouldn't make anything better, so I took my mum's heels, looked into the mirror and told myself I was beautiful.' After her first rejection from a casting call in 2007, Carlene honed her craft by practising different expressions and poses in front of the mirror. Sensational: The model, pictured, received an amazing response at her first runway show without make up 'When I went back to another call I was picked,' she said. 'My confidence went from a zero to 100 percent and I've been modelling ever since.' However she still struggled to accept her vitiligo and covered up the patches with make-up, fearing she would be judged. She said: 'Most people who hired me didn't know I had vitiligo because they only saw a little on my hands and arms. I would cover everything up because I didn't love myself at the time. 'Designers would be upset, they liked my look and confidence but at that point I wasn't ready to show my vitiligo.' But after bravely revealing her skin condition for a show in 2014, she found the courage to discard her make-up in her everyday life. Carlene said: 'Now I only wear make-up occasionally, so I walk on the street barefaced showing my vitiligo. The first day I went out without hiding was nerve-wracking. 'I got a lot of compliments on the street, people were telling me my skin was \"beautiful\", then when I got to work it was the same. 'It was the complete opposite of what I always imagined would happen, I couldn't believe it.' Now she proudly shows off her patches for photoshoots and acts as an advocate for people with vitiligo. Advocate: The model now campaigns for a greater understanding of the rare condition Role model: Carlene, pictured, wants to inspire others who are growing up with vitiligo She is inspired by models like Tyra Banks and Naomi Campbell, as well as her mother Agnes who used to model in the West Indies. 'I want to show others we are regular and like everyone else, but with a hint of difference and that's fine,' she said. 'While growing up, a lot of people used to ask me if I got burned and because I didn't know enough about the condition I couldn't stand up for myself. 'You have to gain knowledge about vitiligo to help yourself and others so they're aware too. I'm not burned, I don't have a disease, you can't catch it, it's just genetics.' The American Vitiligo Research Fund provides information and support to people with the condition, as well as raising funds for treatment. Stella Pavlides, AVRF founder and president, said: 'You are not born with vitiligo, it is an acquired skin disorder that anyone at any time of his or her life can get it. 'Vitiligo does not discriminate and it strikes all ethnicities.'
