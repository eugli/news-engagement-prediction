First responders raced to the school just before noon. \nA woman whose daughter has attended the school told CTV Ottawa that she was walking by the school on Friday when she saw the emergency unfold. \n“I saw the ambulance people just doing CPR … on a little kid,” she said. “But he didn’t come through.” \nShe added: “It’s really sad.” \nThere have been a lot of questions surrounding the death of an apparently healthy child. \nThe Ottawa-Carleton District School Board said that the incident was a medical emergency, and that a media report that stated the tragedy involved a fall was categorically false. \n“This was a regular school day and there was no reported or observed event, accident or incident of concern prior to the medical issues that arose,” the school board said in a statement. \nChildren attending the school, which goes up to Grade 3, were greeted by staff and offered counselling on Monday. \nThe death has also shaken the tight-knit community. “It’s unnerving to see the parents with the police and everything else,” said one neighbour. \nParents and others have posted messages of support on Facebook. \n“My deepest condolences to the family and friends of this poor boy,” Sandy Szeles wrote. \nAnother Facebook commenter called the tragedy “devastating news. No parents should ever have to endure this loss.” \nSchool trustee Keith Penny said that his colleagues are “deeply shocked and saddened” by the death. \n“We’re just totally broke up over the tragic events,” he told CTV Ottawa. \nThe school hopes to have more information on the incident as well as how to support the Martin family in the coming days. \nWith a report from CTV Ottawa's Joanne Schnurr Photos ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T20:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T16:40:04.832+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
