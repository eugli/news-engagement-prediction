EU warning \nMr Grindeanu, from the leftist Social Democratic Party (PSD), said he \"heard and saw many opinions\", including from \"the voice of the street\". \nHe said that parliament would now debate a new corruption law. \nJustice Minister Florin Iordache would take responsibility for the poor communication and confusion around the controversial measure, he added. \nThe decree would have decriminalised abuse of power offences where sums of less than €44,000 (£38,000; $47,500) were involved. \nOne immediate beneficiary would have been Liviu Dragnea, who leads the PSD and faces charges of defrauding the state of €24,000. Image copyright AFP Image caption Prime Minister Grindeanu made the announcement in a televised statement \nThe government had earlier argued that the changes were needed to reduce prison overcrowding and align certain laws with the constitution. \nBut critics saw it as a way for the PSD to absolve officials convicted or accused of corruption. \nThe EU had warned Romania against undoing its progress against corruption. \nThe leftist government only returned to power in December after protests forced its last leader to step down in October 2015.
