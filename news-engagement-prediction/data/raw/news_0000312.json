Benoit Hamon wins French Socialist vote Media caption Why the French presidential election matters \nIf not, the parliament says it will retain half her salary as an MEP and she will also lose other allowances. \n\"I will not submit to the persecution, a unilateral decision taken by political opponents... without proof and without waiting for a judgement from the court action I have started,\" she told Reuters news agency on Tuesday. \nThe money was used to pay the salary of Catherine Griset, a close friend of Ms Le Pen as well as her cabinet director. \nThe funds were conditional on Ms Griset spending most of her working time in Brussels or Strasbourg. \nHowever, the parliament says most of her time was instead spent working in the National Front's headquarters in Paris.
