By: FE Online | Chennai | Published: February 24, 2017 11:05 AM Deepa is likely to launch her political party. (ANI) \nIn a fresh set of events in Tamil Nadu, late former Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa’s niece Deepa Jayakumar had said that she was planning to hold another event. Speaking to India Today she also added that she was not interested in Poes Garden where her aunt used to live. Meanwhile, both factions of AIADMK, led by O Pannerselvam and Chief Minister E Palaniswami are celebrating the 69th birth anniversary of Jayalalithaa today. \nEarlier in the day, there were reports that Deepa is likely to launch her political party today even as people and politicos across Tamil Nadu on Friday led the nation in paying rich tributes to late Chief Minister of the state on her 69th birth anniversary. According to media reports, Deepa is eager to launch her political outfit and has decided not to go with former Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam. A few days ago, however, she had said that she was ready to work with Panneerselvam in the future. When asked if it was her official entry into politics, Jayakumar said,” Yes, it is.” It will be interesting to see what eventually spans out. \nChief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami will launch a massive 69 lakh seedling planting initiative today. He will launch the initiative at the Tamil Nadu Government Multi Super Speciality Hospital Campus in Chennai, according to a report. He will also launch a ‘Massive Greening Programme’ in the cyclone Vardah affected areas. In the past too, massive tree plantation drives had been taken up by the state government on Jayalalithaa’s birth anniversary. She had passed away on December 5, 2016. However, the volatile political situation in the state could mar the day. \nOn the eve of the late Jayalalithaa’s birthday, AIADMK chief V K Sasikala had said she was feeling “lonely” in the absence of her predecessor and long-time friend. In a message to party workers, Sasikala, serving a jail term in connection with a Disproportionate Assets case, urged them to tirelessly serve the public and uphold Jayalalithaa’s fame. \nYou may also like to watch this video \nSasikala had said every year Jayalalithaa’s birthday was celebrated with fervour, but “I never thought this year will turn out to be so challenging.” “That Amma is not with us makes me more sad. After having celebrated her birthday with her for the past 33 years, I feel lonely this year in her memories. My thoughts revolve around her,” she said. Jayalalithaa was a popular leader and anybody who had met her even once would remember her for life, she added.
