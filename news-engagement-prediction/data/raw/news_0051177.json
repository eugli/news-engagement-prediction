I am one of those people. Christopher Kane is trying to make furry Crocs fashionable \nOf course, I worry that people won’t take me seriously. I worry that they’ll think I’m overreacting or worse – making it all up, but it’s not the general public, family or friends thinking this that has made me feel too afraid to seek help. \nIt’s the doctors who were supposed to help me in the first place. \nI suffer from ulcerative colitis, a form of Inflammatory bowel disease. I have suffered with it for years, but I was only officially diagnosed in 2015. \nAnd that only happened after I underwent an emergency operation to remove my large intestine that I was diagnosed. \nFor two years leading up to the operation, I had been in and out of the doctor’s offices. I was looking for help, for explanations for my symptoms. \nMy ‘back passage’ was swollen and constantly bleeding and I had awful abdominal pain. \nThe first GP I saw gave me a tube of cream as an answer and said they couldn’t see anything wrong with me. I believed them, went home, tried out the cream for a few weeks. It didn’t get any better. \nI decided to leave it for a while, I convinced myself that the GP was right, perhaps there was nothing there, maybe it was all in my head. I had to trust a medical professional – they knew best, right? \nA few months later, I moved, and so I signed on with a new GP. \nUnable to ignore the pain any longer, I went to see him. The symptoms were increasingly concerning, with a significant amount of blood being released with each visit to the bathroom. This time, I was given suppositories – but no further tests were done. (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk) \nIt was around this period that I started dealing with chronic constipation. I would go days without using the toilet and be suffering from a remarkable amount of pain. My stomach would be incredibly bloated, and I’d feel uncomfortable in everything I wore. So, I began taking laxatives – but nothing helped. \nI was starting to feel embarrassed about the whole situation. It’s not pleasant to keep going back to your GP and to be told there’s nothing wrong with you – especially when it’s to discuss your toilet habits. I kept telling myself it was all in my head and that I didn’t need to go back for help. \nBut then one day at work I felt the worst stomach cramps I’d ever experienced. I went into the toilets and found I was heavily bleeding from my back passage, like nothing I’d encountered before. \nI went home early from work that day and booked an emergency appointment with my GP. I told him about the cramps and the bleeding – but he said it wasn’t possible that it had come from my back passage. He said I was a young girl (at the time I was 19) and that it was probably ‘women’s troubles’– so he sent me for a scan on my cervix. \nI told him it wasn’t anything to do with the fact I was a woman – but obliged anyway, and went for the scan. \nThe scan proved to be fine, as I knew it would be. But now I was at even more of a loss. My GP had told me the blood couldn’t have come from where it HAD come from – what was I to do? \nI went home and tried to forget about it, dealing with the pain, the bleeding and constipation on my own. (Picture: Charlotte Cockell / metro.co.uk) \nThat was until the beginning of January 2015, when I fell incredibly ill. I was using the toilet more than 30 times a day, I couldn’t eat, lost a lot of weight in a short space of time, was unable to move much, and I was constantly going hot and cold. \nI called my GP surgery and asked for someone to come out to me as I couldn’t get to the surgery myself in that state – but nobody could come. Instead, they told me to pick up some Buscopan, and so my partner went to get some for me. \nI tried the Buscopan, but it didn’t work. I was getting worse and worse by the day. \nFinally, I gave into the pain, and I went to A&E. I have I was just suffering from a bad case of ‘gastroenteritis’ and to come back in two weeks if I was still poorly. \nTwo days later, I felt even worse, and so I ignored their advice and went back to A&E. This time they told me to ‘eat some more bananas’ as they are good for the digestive system. \nI didn’t know what to do. Nobody was listening. I was in excruciating pain, I was using the toilet non-stop, I’d lost a stone in weight, and I was bleeding heavily. \nMy mum took me home to stay with her so that she could keep an eye on me. \nOne morning while at my mum’s, she walked in on me to find me buckled over in bed struggling to breathe through the pain in my abdomen. She decided enough was enough and took me to her GP. \nAnd finally, someone listened. Her GP sent me to A&E with suspected appendicitis. (Picture: Liberty Antonia Sadler for Metro.co.uk) \nLuckily, my temperature had risen so at that point the hospital were unable to turn me away. They took me down for surgery immediately, and I had my appendix removed. \nBut it turns out the appendix wasn’t the problem. \nI was moved to an isolated room because I was still having chronic diarrhoea. I was on the maximum dose of pain relief, and I was delirious. \nI couldn’t eat, and I was high on morphine. \nTwo weeks into my hospital stay with no progress despite numerous scans, something went incredibly wrong in my body. A loud popping sound came from my stomach and my family rushed around to find a doctor like crazy. \nUnsure of what to do, the nurse wanted to avoid finding a doctor and insisted on giving me more pain relief. But my mum refused – and went to find a doctor herself. \nIn the space of half an hour, I was being rushed down to theatre for emergency surgery. \nMy illness resulted in me having the entirety of my large bowel removed, as it was just half an hour from perforating, and I was given a stoma and an ileostomy bag. I was later told this was due to having suffered from ulcerative colitis unknowingly for years. \nI had the ileostomy bag for ten months before undergoing a reversal surgery, where they remove the bag and connect me back up small intestine to the rectum. But it’s been an incredibly hard recovery, and one that could have been avoided had people listened earlier on. (Picture: Liberty Antonia Sadler/ Metro) \nI’ve also lost a lot of hope when it comes to seeking help for medical issues, especially as a young woman where symptoms are so easily fobbed off as ‘women’s troubles’. \nThe care I’ve received has even made me incredibly self-conscious of my own illness. Whether that be when I fear needing to take a seat on public transport , what to say when someone asks me why I’m not feeling too good or when I need to cancel on plans – because I’m utterly terrified that I’m not going to be believed, or people are going to think I’m just making excuses or being lazy.
