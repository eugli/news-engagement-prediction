Small Press Expo (SPX) The SPX is all about small press comic books and those of the independent comic book genre. It is a smaller convention, especially when compared to CCI, but it is certainly the place to go for independent publishers. They refuse to sell convention space to retailers and only offer their booths to independent publishers. This makes it a very intimate affair for fans to meet and connect with their beloved creators and publishers of small press books.
