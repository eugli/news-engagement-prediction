Most Popular By Jack Holmes Feb 21, 2017 Hypocrisy is dead. There is no longer any penalty for saying one thing and doing the polar opposite in American politics—even when it comes to golf. Cut to President Trump, who used to love a good potshot at his predecessor over his love of the game: Can you believe that,with all of the problems and difficulties facing the U.S., President Obama spent the day playing golf.Worse than Carter \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2014 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Politico reports that then-Businessman Trump mocked then-President Obama's golf habit more than two dozen times, including as recently as December. \"I love golf, I think it's one of the greats, but I don't have time,\" Trump said at a rally in Michigan , adding of Obama: \"He played more golf last year than Tiger Woods. We don't have time for this. We don't have time for this. We have to work.\" In August, it was a similar story: \"I'm going to be working for you,\" he told a crowd in Virginia. \"I'm not going to have time to go play golf.\" Most Popular Trump today made his 6th trip to the golf course in 30 days as president.Here are his previous tweets about presidents and golf: pic.twitter.com/66361Bgk3b \n— Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) February 19, 2017 These days, according to The Washington Post , the new president spends just under a quarter (24 percent) of his time at Mar a Lago, his Winter White House™ in Florida. In his first month in office, Trump has spent around 25 hours playing golf. In comparison, the president has, in the Post 's calculation, devoted 21 hours to foreign relations and six to intelligence briefings, while 221 hours have been gone to \"other work time.\" These 1,600-mile round-trip excursions on Air Force One aren't free, either: CBS News puts the price tag for his three weekend jaunts at more than $10 million. This, too, used to be a problem for him: Advertisement - Continue Reading Below \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 5, 2012 While President Trump is no longer concerned about presidential expenditures—or even the optics involved—it seems his staff is. Here's a White House account of Trump's outing with pro golfer Rory McIlroy this past weekend, according to KTLA 5 : \n\"I know he played a couple of holes this morning but I am not going to disclose any of the others that were there,\" Sanders said, adding that Trump also \"played a couple\" on Saturday, as well. But when confronted with McIlroy's comment that they played 18 holes, Sanders immediately backtracked, saying the president \"intended to play a few holes and decided to play longer.\" So we're lying about how many holes it was now? In a comparably sketchy episode, Politico reports, Trump's staffers have gone to considerable lengths to try to shield his outings from the press: \nAides have tried to block reporters from seeing Trump play in recent weeks, even covering a basement room with black plastic bags to obscure views of what was happening on the course outside. But while some of those working for him might have a problem with it, none of this is likely to make a difference. Hypocrisy has little weight when you have no capacity for shame and a base of supporters who in some cases welcome the prospect of American dictatorship so long as the dictator is you. But really, the idea that a president can't go golfing has always been a bush league talking point. Dwight Eisenhower played over 800 rounds of golf and no one was raving about impeachment. There are plenty of bones to pick with Woodrow Wilson, but his 1,200 trips to the link while in office usually aren't at the top of the list. It's not like the job doesn't walk the course with them.
