It is absurd that we are told you cannot sell bananas of bunches of more than two or three bananas.\n'You cannot sell bananas with abnormal curvature of the fingers.\n'Why should they tell us? Why should they tell us how powerful our vacuum cleaners should be?\n'Why should they tell us how powerful our hairdryers should be? This is not a matter for an international, supranational body to dictate to the British people.'\nHowever, his comments were immediately ridiculed by Twitter users and journalists, while the Stronger In campaign gleefully posted photographs of bigger bunches.\nSpokesman Will Straw posted that 'Boris really has gone bananas'.\n'As everyone knows u can buy bananas in large bunches,' he wrote alongside a photograph.\nLabour MP Jess Phillips said: 'If Boris wants the British people to believe a word he says, he is going to have to sort out his casual relationship with the truth.\n'His made-up stories on bananas is positively slapstick. It tells me he isn't buying bananas for his kids pack lunches very often.\n'I manage to buy a bunch of more than 3 bananas every week!\n'He is consistently using figures dismissed by experts as 'misleading' and this is another gaffe. Boris is trying to win this referendum with a comedy of errors and falsehoods.\n'It would be funny if the potential consequences of a vote to leave the EU were not so immense – including potential economic damage worth £4,300 a year for families – voters need to make the decision based on fact, not Boris' nonsense.'\nThe BBC and ITV political editors also joined in with the ribbing. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg wrote that it showed Mr Johnson 'rarely does the food shop'.\nAnd ITV's Robert Peston said: 'Am I dreaming? Is it a joke?'\nBut aides to the former mayor fought back, admitting that he 'misspoke' and had in fact been trying to say that bananas could not be sold in twos or threes.\nHe had been making the point that it was 'ludicrous' for the EU to specify how big bunches should be, they added.\nThe Vote Leave campaign highlighted regulations from 2011 which state: 'The bananas must be presented in hands or clusters (parts of hands) of at least four fingers. Bananas may also be presented as single fingers.\n'Clusters with not more than two missing fingers are allowed, provided that the stalk is not torn but cleanly cut, without damage to the neighbouring fingers.'", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T12:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T17:15:35.150+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
