He states when it’s someone like him, they’re always marginalized, and the press pretends as if they have a voice who gets a fair shake but it’s not the case. He provides how it’s very clear who the opposition is and how the media is in the opposition and why speaking the truth is so terrifying to these people. \nTo see more from Buck, visit his channel on TheBlaze and listen live to “The Buck Sexton Show” weekdays 12–3pm ET, only on TheBlaze Radio Network .
