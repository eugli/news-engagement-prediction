Apparently, that decision has not been taken yet,” he told reports in Chittagong. \n“It’s a failure as a state, we can’t hold an exam properly,” he added while addressing the Bangla Festival programme at the Municipal Model High School and College. \nAround 2000 students from 17 institutions took part in the festival titled ‘Sabdakalpadroom Pipilika Bangla Utsab'. \nA computer science and engineering professor at the Shajahalal University of Science and Technology and a prolific writer, Zafar Iqbal said “there are different sets of question papers in an exam, then how come all the sets are coming out despite strict measures?” \nA bdnews24.com investigative reporter managed to obtain the math question through WhatsApp messaging app on late Feb 10 night which was a match with the paper used in Feb 11 exam. Six people were arrested on Feb 12 in connection with the leaks, but two more questions were reportedly leaked on Feb 14 and Feb 16 in Barisal education board and Dhaka board respectively.\nProf Iqbal said a cavalier attitude of the authorities and not bringing the culprits to justice are reasons behind repeated leaks of question papers in public examinations in Bangladesh. \n“Until now I haven't seen the persons in charge of printing and distributing the question papers have held responsible or punished. If the government put them in jail then I could think the government is trying its best to stop it,” he said. \n“No one is responsible (for this). They have taken it for granted that it will happen and we have to live with it. It can’t continue.” \nCiting the last medical college admission exam, Prof Iqbal said “there is a full-proof mechanism of holding exam in place. I have witnessed that. \n\"If they can do it, it’s possible to do the same in other exams.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T04:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T04:03:44.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
