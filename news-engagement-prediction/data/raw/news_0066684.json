It's important you only consider the evidence you've heard during this trial. Ad Feedback \n\"You're the sole judges of fact.\" \nThe jury have heard from ten witnesses over the last week, including evidence from the complainant and the defendant. \nOn Thursday, lawyers for the Crown and the defence gave their closing statements. \nIn her closing statement, Crown prosecutor Jacinda Foster told the jury the case was not complicated and that the account given by the complainant was at the heart of the Crown's case \n\"[Her] intoxication should have no bearing on her credibility or her reliability,\" Foster said. \n\"[The defendant was never entitled to assume that one act of physical intimacy would ultimately lead to an act of sexual intercourse.\" \nDefence counsel Phillip Morgan, QC, said the complainant relented because after two initial refusals to have sex and partaking in foreplay, she could not turn him down. \n\"She couldn't turn this man down yet again because she would then be thought of as a b.... or a tease,\" Morgan said. \nMy client respected the complainant's wishes at night \"when he could've had her so easily when she was drunk\", Morgan said. \n\"That's not the behaviour of a rapist, is it?\" Morgan said. \n\"This case demonstrates clearly that she had consented. My client didn't intend to hurt somebody but he did.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:15:01.289+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
