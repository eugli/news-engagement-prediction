He was described by the US treasury as a drug \"kingpin\" who worked with traffickers in Mexico and Colombia to ship drugs to America. \nHe accused the US of \"imperialist aggression\" in response and President Nicolas Maduro demanded a public apology.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T05:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:04:35.201+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
