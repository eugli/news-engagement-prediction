Credit: Steven Paston / PA \nChris Eubank Jr is the new IBO World super-middleweight champion after beating Australia's Renold Quinlan with a 10th round stoppage. \nEubank, 27, claimed his 24th victory in 25 fights to win the title despite a dogged performance from his opponent who battled harder than many predicted. \nThe fight was the first pay-per-view boxing event on ITV Box Office but some fans complained that they missed coverage of the earlier fights because of a blue screen. \nEubank has now become a world champion more than 26 years after his father won the WBO middleweight title.
