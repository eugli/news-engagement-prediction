You know that story. The real number -- that's the real number,\" Trump said at a press conference on Jan. 11. \nIt is true: More than 95 million Americans are not working -- but it isn't true that they all really want a job. \nTo see how it all breaks down, CNNMoney got the numbers for the most recent quarter from the Atlanta Federal Reserve. \nAll Americans 16 years old and up : 254.5 million \nAmericans in the labor force with a job : 152.2 million \nAmericans in the labor force without a job: 7.2 million \nThat leaves 95.1 millionAmericans not in the labor force. But a lot of them are not in the labor force forunderstandable reasons. \n44.1 million are retired. \n12.9 million are taking care of a family member. \n15.5 million are in college or job training. \nSo: of the95.1 millionAmericans not working, 87.9 million are retired, disabled, taking care of a loved one, or in school. \nThat leaves 7.2 million people - what about them? \n5.5 million Americans have looked for a job in the past year OR want a job but have given up searching for over a year . \n1.7 million Americans are in the shadows . We don't know why they are not in the work force.
