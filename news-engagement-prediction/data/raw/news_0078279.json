Charles Cruft was a British showman who founded the Crufts dog show Who started Crufts? \nC rufts is named after its founder Charles Cruft who established the show in 1891. \nThe young Charles left college in 1876 with no desire to join the family jewellery business. Instead he took a job with James Spratt who had set up a new venture in Holborn, London selling 'dog cakes'. \nMr Cruft was ambitious was soon promoted to travelling salesman which brought him into contact with large estates and sporting kennels. He began travelling to Europe and in 1878 French dog breeders invited him to organise the promotion of the canine section of the Paris Exhibition. \nBack in England in 1886 he took up the management of the Allied Terrier Club Show at the Royal Aquarium, Westminster. It was in 1891 that the first Cruft's show was booked into the Royal Agricultural Hall in Islington and it has evolved ever since.

Officials admitted deliberately cutting footage from a broadcast of the prize-winning German shepherd with walking difficulties. \nIn 2015, an Irish Setter named Jagger collapsed shortly after arriving back in Belgium after coming second in her class. An investigation found that Jagger had been poisoned. Many assumed he had been poisoned while at Crufts, but a later toxicology report revealed he was fed a fast-acting poison once in Belgium. \nAt one show, judges were left shocked when they found a third testicle on a terrier . The owner had implanted a fake one (just one of the dog's testicles had descended into the scrotum and the judges required two on display), only to have the retained testicle drop during the show. The owner was banned from showing dogs for several years.
