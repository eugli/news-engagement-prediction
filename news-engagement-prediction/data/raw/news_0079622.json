HAHAHA!   Mon, 27/02/2017 - 10:56am \nDear A.S.S. Editor \nPM Lee making us all laugh early this morning. In that sense, he is a terrific PM for Singapore, he knows we all facing Monday Blues, so he is doing his best to help us all laugh to work this Monday morning. Advertisement \nHe said leaders must remain open to other views, and also important for leaders to not be surrounded by \"yes men\" who paint only a positive picture. He might say these things, but actually, who in his cabinet listening to him? Most of them are Yes Men in the first place, for them to get to where they are now. Of course, nobody will admit they are Yes Men, so let's just humour them and say they got to where they are through sheer hard work. \nAnd leaders open to other views? Did anyone of them listened to the citizens who keeps saying prices are going up and up, and never down, but salary never go up at the same rate? Yup, they \"listened\" to us, that's why water prices increase, public transport prices increase, and S&CC also increased. \nYup, these are exactly the kind of leaders the PM was talking about. \nTan K M \nA.S.S.
