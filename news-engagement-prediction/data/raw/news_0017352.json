It is still the 2016-17 season, replete with those basement expectations that have never seen the light of day inside the University of Tennessee’s very own program. \nTheir very composure suggests youth neither is crutch nor even salient to discussion of Tennessee basketball a week after the Vols’ solid-but-not-spectacular close to football recruiting for the campus’‘front porch program.’ \nBarnes’ boys, somehow, are owners of an above-.500 Southeastern Conference slate on the heels of their latest coming-of-age episode in this season-long reality show. With a gimpy Robert Hubbs and considerably less seasoning than visiting Ole Miss, the Vols nonetheless await Georgia on Saturday after a 75-66 bounce-back win on the heels of last Saturday’s fall-from-ahead clunker at Mississippi State. \n“We tell them during the game and we tell them all of the time that it shouldn’t be easy. It wouldn’t be fun if it were really easy, even though sometimes you wish it was easy,” Barnes said. \"The fact is that you are going to have to win some tough games. We are going have the same battle here Saturday. \n\"We could tell the first half that we were back a little bit. Maybe they felt pressure because we lost Saturday and thought we had to win this game. What we have to do is execute the game plan. If you win, you win. If you don’t, you don’t. I will say this: that I think the schedule that we have played all year has helped these guys get to this point and we have to see if we can keep building on that.\" \nSo an injury to John Fulkerson keeps him in freshman status, and a redshirt campaign does the same for Jalen Johnson --- the guy sitting atop the most hype as centerpiece of Barnes’ foundation-supplying crop of newcomers. \nGrant Williams ? Forget it. Jordan Bone ? No chance. \nDo both at times resemble freshmen? Of course they do, and they are going to see some such instances in review of this improbable come-from-behind victory. \nMostly, though, they are no longer carrying themselves as green-orange rookies or ‘Baby Vols’ or any other moniker. \nThey’re simply the nucleus of Barnes’ team sitting improbably on the threshold of giving the veteran coach perhaps his most unlikely NCAA Tournament bid. \n“It’s been basically a whole season, we’re towards the end,” Williams said, “and we can’t really say we’re freshmen anymore. It’s February. \n“That shouldn’t be an excuse anymore. We’ve had these games and we’ve just established that in the locker room. We shouldn’t blame it on youth. We shouldn’t blame it on maturity and how we’ll do it next year. We’re thinking about this year; we want to do it for Hubbs, and that’s huge for us.” \nHubbs is, of course, Robert Hubbs . The only Vol on the roster with five-star status and McDonald’s All-American hype. \nThe lone four-year senior for the Vols. \nThe guy on this night working through a balky knee, not to mention an illness Hubbs believes encountered due to the wild weather swings this week in East Tennessee. \n“He’s trying so hard to fight through it,” Barnes said of his All-SEC worthy reclamation project in Hubbs. “He didn't do a lot (Tuesday at practice). Then I got a text early (Wednesday) morning, (saying he) feels like he's got the flu. Thought he fought through that tonight. Not that he does have the flu. \n“But he's trying. That's all you can ask him to do.” \nTennessee knows now it can not have remotely its most efficient outing, and against rugged, quality opposition, and find a way to triumph after some half-dozen times erasing deficits of at least four points in the second half before securing victory with a game-ending 15-2 run across the final 3 minutes, 49 seconds. \n“We’re a young team. So in the beginning we let a couple games slip,” said Hubbs. “Now we’re learning to overcome that hump and finish games out strong, the way we need to. \n“All the time [youth is no longer an excuse], that’s something the coaching staff explains everyday. All that freshmen stuff is over. You’re in February. You just have to play.” \nThe freshmen stuff is over; the good stuff for this Vols’ basketball season? Perhaps it’s still a few weeks away during a special team of year where most folks don’t act their age. \nThey call it “March Madness.” Author", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T11:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T11:56:37.837+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
