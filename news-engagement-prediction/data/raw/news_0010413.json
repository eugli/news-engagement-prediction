Today, the CFDA announced Fashion Stands With Planned Parenthood, a campaign to raise awareness of the organization during this coming New York Fashion Week. They have created bright-pink pins, designed by the Condé Nast Creative Group, which they hope will be worn by designers and models, and which will be distributed to front-row denizens. (CFDA board member Tracy Reese is leading the charge.) Among the 40+ designers participating are DVF, Carolina Herrera, Proenza Schouler, and Narciso Rodriguez.\nEach pin will be accompanied by a card listing actions people can take to get involved. The CFDA is encouraging everyone who receives a pin to post their picture to social media using the hashtag #IStandwithPP.\n“We know that so many people stand with Planned Parenthood — including designers and entertainers — because they and their loved ones have relied on Planned Parenthood for health care, including life-saving care like cancer screenings, birth control, STI testing and treatment and sex education,” Reese said in a statement. “Planned Parenthood is often the only option for this type of care in underserved communities. By creating a visually engaging and fashionable pin, we hope to create an organic social media movement promoting awareness and education.”\nTags: fashions cfda planned parenthood political fashion tracy reese Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories At 16, My Mom Flew to Japan Alone to Have an Abortion 5 Female-Centric Movies From Sundance You’ll Want to See Immediately These Are the 23 Makeup Products From Lady Gaga’s Super Bowl Look Most Viewed Stories Ivanka Trump’s Brand Issues an Even Longer Response to Nordstrom News Sean Spicer Chews and Swallows 35 Pieces of Gum Every Day Before Noon Chelsea Peretti and Jordan Peele’s Beyoncé-Inspired Pregnancy Announcement Rules Neiman Marcus Has Also Dropped Ivanka Trump’s Line Something About This Photo Sure Feels Familiar People Are Taking to Twitter to Show Trump What It Really Means to Dress Like a Woman Sorry, There Are Actually Only Six Sex Positions Someone Give Melissa McCarthy an Emmy for Her Screamin’ Good Sean Spicer Impression Kristen Stewart Makes Pizza Rolls Sexy in This Saturday Night Live Sketch Trump Is Reportedly Obsessed With How the People Who Work For Him Dress From Our Partners goop\nClean Beauty and Why It’s Important\nHuffPost Lifestyle\nTeen Vogue: The Complete Guide To Color Correcting Any…\nPOPSUGAR Fashion\nMichelle Obama's Dress Will Tell You Exactly Where…\npowered by PubExchange\nMost Popular Video On The Cut These Cats Behave Like Melodramatic Humans The Latest on the Cut 16 mins ago At 16, My Mom Flew to Japan Alone to Have an Abortion One woman’s unplanned pregnancy before Roe v.
