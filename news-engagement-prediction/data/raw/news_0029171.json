Monday's one-hour finale averaged just a 0.9 rating among adults 18-49 and 3.4 million viewers, placing fourth in the hour behind a dominant Bachelor , CBS comedies and Fox freshman APB . (The ABC reality show remains on a hot streak, winning the night another 2.3 rating in the key demo.) \nThe numbers, tied with series lows, wouldn't be half bad if NBC hadn't poured so many resources into the new iteration, hosted by former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, and if its time-shifting lifts weren't so modest. Through the last full week of January, The Apprentice 's latest live-plus-seven day averages only give it a 1.4 rating in the key demo and 5.1 million viewers. Compared to the last season hosted by Trump, who retained an executive producer credit on the competition of vaguely familiar talent facing off in entrepreneurial challenges after vacating an on-camera role to run for office, that's down nearly 42 percent in the key demo. It's likely a death knell for the show. Even if the ratings were better, producers MGM TV and creator Mark Burnett's ties to Trump have been a headache for the network. \nFor a moment in December, it seemed that the Trump ties might have worked in NBC's favor. But the new Apprentice never overcame its baggage, with relatively few viewers sampling the reboot. None of the attention around the president's unprecedented financial stake in the show could drive numbers up — even after the commander-in-chief used a prayer breakfast to ask religious leaders, elected officials and dignitaries to pray that the show's ratings improve . \nComparisons between this run of The Apprentice and its last season in 2015 aren't entirely fair. That run of the show marked an unexpected ratings spike after several years of fatigue. (That season brought a rare 25 percent from the prior one.) It was enough to make Trump falsely claim at the time that it was the highest rated show on TV. Elsewhere, ABC won the night with its combo of The Bachelor and Quantico — even though latter tied NBC's Timeless as the lowest-rated Big Four effort of the night with a 0.7 same-day score among adults 18-49. The entire CBS block of Kevin Can Wait (1.5 adults), Man With a Plan (1.4 adults), Superior Donuts (1.4 adults), 2 Broke Girls (1.2 adults) and Scorpion (1.2 adults) held even with the previous week, locking in No. 2 status among adults 18-49 for the network. 24: Legacy is not pulling the kind of live numbers that its franchise is used to. Though the post-Super Bowl episode rose to stratospheric highs with time-shifting, its second Monday episode only earned a 1.2 rating among adults 18-49 and 5.1 million viewers. That's off three-tenths of a point in the key demo from last week. Neighbor APB was down by an even larger margin, losing half of a ratings point for a 1.0 in the key demo. The CW saw modest improvement for both Supergirl (0.8 adults) and Jane the Virgin (0.4 adults).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T14:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T18:38:30.062+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
