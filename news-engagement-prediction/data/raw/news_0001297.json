By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: February 4, 2017 5:53 PM Tamil Actress Gautami Tadimalla. Source: IE \nTamil actress Gautami Tadimalla wrote an open letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressing her anguish at the Centre’s decision to stay silent on the mysterious death of one of Tamil Nadu’s beloved Amma, former Chief Minister Jayalalitha. In her latest blog titled ‘The Greatest Tragedy of Ignored Voices’, Gautami hit out at the Centre and has described the plight of the people of Tamil Nadu after the death of their beloved ‘Amma’. \nIn a previous letter that she had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on her blog, Gautami had written an open letter, dated December 8, 2016 and it was titled ‘Tragedy and unanswered Questions’, in which she had described how the conditions of Tamil Nadu have worsened after the death of CM Jayalalitha. She also wrote ‘I am writing to you now, sir, with the complete confidence that you share my anxiety and determination to uphold the rights of every Indian to be aware and informed of any factor that impacts our day to day life. You have proven yourself in many ways to be a leader who is unafraid to stand up for the rights of the common man and I am confident that you will heed the call of your fellow countrymen.’ \nYou will feel the anguish with which she wrote the open letter again to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, some of the key points of her blog are as follows- \n1. “As a political leader who has promised to listen to his people and bring about true and meaningful change in the way this country has been governed through the past decades, this denying any knowledge even of a justified and rightful query from the very citizens of his country is disappointing to say the least. How is a citizen’s query, made with honest intent and immense grief, any less relevant because it has been delivered on a communication platform of modern technology?” \n2. “My state has been battered since the past several months in unprecedented and shattering ways. Amma’s heartrendingly tragic demise that has left an indelible mark upon each of us in different ways. Cyclone Varadha that tore us up and ripped us apart in a storm of huge proportions. We are still, and will be struggling for a long time to come, with the devastating aftermath of this calamity.” \n3. “As citizens of this state and this nation, we are entitled to have complete knowledge of these details. It is a fundamental confidence and security that a democratic nation owes her people. In addition to this, Amma is a leader who has a lasting and very real bond with the crores of her people who love and respect her. Our anguish and our grief must be respected and honoured with answers. With the truth.” \n4. “What will it take for our governments to listen to us? For them to respond to us? Another massive uprising of every citizen on the streets of this state before they will pay attention? And do the right thing only when faced with protests of gargantuan proportions? At what human cost?” \nAlso Read: Sasikala era to begin in Tamil Nadu? Not really! \nGautami has raised some hard hitting questions regarding the Centre’s “silence” over the mystery surrounding former Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa’s death. Will Gautami’s open letter receive any response or will the silence continue? Meanwhile, as news reports suggest, it looks like Sasikala is likely to take charge as Tamil Nadu CM early next week.
