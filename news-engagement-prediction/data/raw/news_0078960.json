It could herald an end to transplants and lead to a treatment for heart failure within three to five years. GETTY Stem cells can reverse scarring by up to 79 per cent \nProfessor Westaby said: “This would be the biggest breakthrough since the first transplants three decades ago.” \nProfessor Westaby has been working on the technique for more than a decade and is carrying out the study with Professor Kim Fox, head of the National Heart and Lung Institute, at Imperial College London. \nThe implanted stem cells were created by medical outfit Celixir, co-founded by Nobel laureate Professor Martin Evans, the first scientist to culture mice embryonic stem cells in a laboratory. \nProfessor Westaby was inspired to work on the breakthrough in 1999 after a four-month-old baby girl’s heart healed itself after he carried out a major life-saving operation. \nKirsty Collier, from Swindon, was dying of a serious and rare heart defect. In a last ditch effort Professor Westaby cut away a third of her badly damaged heart. GETTY GETTY Initial trials are being planned for the autumn at two London hospitals \nSurprisingly it began to beat. Fourteen years later a scan has shown that the heart had healed itself. \nNow Kirsty, 18, has a normal one. Professor Westaby said: “She was essentially dead and was only resurrected by what I regarded at the time as a completely bizarre operation. \n“The fact there was no sign of heart damage told me there were foetal stem cells in babies’ hearts that could remove scarring of heart muscle. That never happens in adults. \n“It’s all down to the clues we got from Kirsty’s operation.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:08:25.191+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
