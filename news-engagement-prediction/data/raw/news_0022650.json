Bolt and Devine clash on-air \n3AW and 2GB commentators Andrew Bolt and Miranda Devine have a heated on-air clash. \nThe pay-off is the approving praise of men high on the fumes of being reassured of their own superiority. They devote a good majority of their energy into talking about how great men are, how inequality is a myth and how they personally know that the only thing that propels their career forward is merit. In return, the kinds of men who find women-in-the-kitchen jokes the height of cutting-edge comedy applaud and congratulate. Here's a woman who gets it, the say. You should be more like her. \nFor women whose self-worth appears to hinge so tightly on what men think of them (and whose ambitions seem driven by the desire to be the Official Woman in the roomful of men whose professional company they aspire to), being suddenly cast in the glare of disapproval must feel like a betrayal.

They simpered and fawned and made sure their male friends/colleagues/dates/commuters/strangers understood that they weren't a threat to them. That they would reinforce their power and flatter them with their deference to the system, all in exchange for a handful of meaningless boy points that made them feel worthwhile. Who, me? Well, I'm not like other girls I guess. \nSo look, there's an element of schadenfreude to watching Miranda Devine be turned on by her own flock. After Devine clashed with fellow News flunky Andrew Bolt earlier in the week, it didn't take long for typical sexist critiques to appear . Advertisement \nDevine (whose great crime was not only disagreeing with Bolt, but correctly pointing out that he was behaving in a hypocritical manner) went from being \"the respectable voice of reason\" granted to Official Women the world over to being dismissed by commenters on Bolt's Murdoch-funded diary as \"one of those shouty women\" who sounds like \"one very spoiled brat\" who \"is yet to grow up\". \nAs Crikey detailed , one clearly addled reader described Devine as being \"just another screeching leftie\". Because when I think of the woman who once defended the use of the word \"gay\" as an insult because \"young people use 'gay' to mean lame, or dumb or stupid\", the first thing that comes to mind is a bra-burning leftist harridan who probably sleeps on a hammock knitted from her own public hair. You know, the right wing's idea of a screeching leftie. \nI am 100 per cent certain that Devine won't be too bruised by the comments on Bolt's blog. Say what you like about her politics, but that woman sleeps on a bed of nails if anything. \nStill, I have to wonder if she'd at least acknowledge that these kinds of comments are clearly driven by a sexist differentiation between her and her male colleague. Bolt is in no danger of being addressed by his followers as \"shouty\", nor would one ever suggest he must have been a prissy handful as a schoolboy. \nIf the people currently threatening to boycott her show until regular host Steve Price returns were to be successful in having management reconsider any future opportunities, would Devine argue (as so many of her like-minded colleagues both male and female do) that this was a matter of merit and not sexism? That clearly she wasn't up to the task and by the way don't complain about that but cop it on the chin like blokes are good at doing? \nI suspect she'll stay pretty silent on all this. Official Women usually do. Perhaps more interesting is waiting to see how her female colleagues will react to some of the commentary, not to mention to the fact a clearly annoyed Bolt (who is notoriously described in media circles as being in possession of a glass jaw) dangled it as bait above the gnashing teeth of his borderline illiterate readership with the full knowledge they'd unleash their fury on her. \nGosh, it must be hard suddenly realising that no matter how hard you suck up, you're still fair game if you do something they don't like.
