Lubetzky is using the money to create a watchdog group called Feed the Truth, which he says will promote truth, transparency, and integrity and hopes will help people make healthier nutrition decisions. \nThis seems like the next logical step for Lubetzky, 49, who has transformed his 13-year-old company from a line of healthy energy bars that use real ingredients into an operation of incredible commercial success , with more than 1 billion units sold and $673.4 million in revenue. But to Lubetzky, KIND’s financial victories are second to its charitable endeavors. Every month, for example, the company issues a series of $10,000 grants to people and organizations seeking to provide kindness and relief to those less fortunate. So Lubetzky’s efforts to distance himself and his company from Big Food companies that influence public health policy aren’t surprising—not that that’s his goal, per se. “I would hope that people say, okay, these guys are doing the right thing for society, I'm going to be more loyal to the brand,” Lubetzky told the AP .
