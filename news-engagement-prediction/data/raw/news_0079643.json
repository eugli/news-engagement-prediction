John has worked his entire adult life. We need to fight to keep them together so he has someone to care for him, and so she can stay with her family, where her home is. \nIrene has nowhere to go in Singapore, both her parents have passed away - her whole life is here in Britain. It would be heartbreaking for all of us to see her go. – Angela Clennall \nMrs Clennell, of Durham, told Buzzfeed News that her sudden removal was seemingly intended to prevent her from launching a legal challenge against the government. She had been due to meet her lawyer on Monday. \nShe was told to say break the news to her husband and say goodbye a phone call but “I was just in tears, I wasn’t able to say much\". Mrs Clennell was held at the Dungavel Immigration Removal Centre. Credit: PA \nMrs Clennell was detained by immigration officials earlier this year and held at a detention centre in South Lanarkshire after falling foul of increasingly strict rules for foreign-born spouses. \nThey require that the British partner earns a minimum of £18,600 a year - and that both partners remain living in the UK for long,uninterrupted periods of time. \nIt was this second rule that led to Mrs Clennell losing her right to remain after she returned to Singapore for over two years to look after her parents at the end of their lives. \nShe had repeatedly made attempts to sort out her visa status but was rebuffed and was struggling to afford the fees, the family said. \nHer husband John told Buzzfeed it was \"trickery\" to remove people on a Sunday when they can't contact their lawyers and vowed the family would fight the case. \nThey have since raised £24,000 from well-wishers to help them towards their legal costs. \nA Home Office spokesman said: “All applications for leave to remain in the UK are considered on their individual merits and in line with the immigration rules. We expect those with no legal right to remain in the country to leave.” Last updated Mon 27 Feb 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T17:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T12:30:15.256+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
