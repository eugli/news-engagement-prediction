Researchers have said the supervised sites, like two already in operation in Vancouver, help to reduce the transmission of illnesses like HIV and hepatitis C. \nOf the roughly 200 drug injection users surveyed in the London study, 86 per cent said they would make use of a supervised injection site. \nAs for what will happen next, the board said it will investigate which SIS model will suit London’s needs the best and also move forward with community consultations.
