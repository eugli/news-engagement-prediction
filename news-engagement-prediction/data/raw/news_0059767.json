But, the Australian of Indian origin is set to make a comeback with a key role in Vidya Balan-starrer, Begum Jaan, which releases in April. \"I will be in Mumbai before the release,\" says the actress, who is currently filming another project in New York.\nPallavi does not wish to mope over what went wrong earlier. \"How could I have regrets? I am living my dream and am incredibly blessed to be doing so. I dreamt of being a Bollywood actress since I was three.\" After bagging smaller roles in films like My Name Is Khan (2010) and Heroine (2012), her lead role in Besharam was touted to be her big Bollywood break. But murmurs about the actress not getting along with Kapoor Jr called for criticism. \"As a newcomer, I chose to be respectful of senior actors I was working with.\nI took their cue on how much they might like to interact or not. Ranbir was a pleasure to shoot with,\" clarifies Pallavi, who also has a small part in Dev Patel-starrer Lion. \"It was interesting to be part of a story about identity search in an Indo-Australian environment,\" she says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T09:28:49.888+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
