Wayne Rooney has started only eight Premier League games for Manchester United so far this season. \nBut with Rooney reluctant to push for a deal to happen this month, for footballing reasons and also because of a desire to ensure his next move is right for his wife, Coleen, and three young children, the most likely outcome is that he remains at Old Trafford until the end of the season. \nAt that point, interest from China and MLS will be considered, with United expected to bolster their attacking options in the summer and further diminish Rooney's first-team opportunities. \nTalks have taken place between Rooney's representatives and Chinese clubs, but with only two Chinese Super League outfits -- Jiangsu Suning and Beijing Guoan -- having space to sign an overseas players due to the limit of three per club, his options are limited. \nSimilarly, there is not anticipated to be a variety of offers from MLS due to the league's move away from highly paid imports, but there is some interest from America and that will also be considered in the summer. \nRooney, meanwhile, is continuing to train at United's Carrington training ground in an effort to prove his fitness to be named in Mourinho's squad for Sunday's EFL Cup Final against Southampton at Wembley. \nMark Ogden is a senior football writer for ESPN FC.
