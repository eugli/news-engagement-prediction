Police said she showed her breasts and buttocks while she danced in front of and on the man in December. \nInvestigators said the man has dementia, but Fultz's attorney said the resident could have told her to stop but did not. \n\"The man knew exactly what was going on and had no problem whatsoever with it,\" defence lawyer Geoffrey Oglesby said on Wednesday. \nPolice said the caretaker who recorded Fultz later showed the video to a supervisor, who reported it to police this month. \nThe second caretaker was not charged. \nThe director of the assisted living center said Fultz, of Marblehead, was fired and the other caretaker also no longer works at the facility.
