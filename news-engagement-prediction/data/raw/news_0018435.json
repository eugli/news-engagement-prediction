Photo: Stefan Postles/ Getty Images. \nPrime minister Malcolm Turnbull has axed the Life Gold Pass which entitles members of parliament to post-retirement travel benefits. \nThe Australian reports that the prime minister will immediately put an end to the pass instead of allowing a phase-out period. \nNow it will only be available to former prime ministers, although Turnbull has said he would not use it. \nThe move is part of wider entitlement reforms, following the Sussan Ley travel entitlement scandal last month which saw her resign as the minister of health and minister of sport. \nAs a result Turnbull is set to introduce an independent agency that will report MPsâ€™ spending monthly, with the support of the Opposition. \nSince 2012 the Life Gold Pass capped the number of flights per MP per year to 10. The entitlement included certain benefits for the spouse or de facto partner of a former eligible member or prime minister. \nThe entitlement of parliamentarians to the Life Gold Pass has been in operation since 1918. Since 2001 the Gold Pass has cost taxpayers $17.2m. \nMore to come. \nFollow Business Insider Australia on Facebook , Twitter , LinkedIn , and Instagram .
