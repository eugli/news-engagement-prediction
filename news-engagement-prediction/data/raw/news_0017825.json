Vogue : *Gets Kendall and Gigi again.*\" By Rachel Torgerson Courtesy Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Vogue made waves yesterday , when it released its March 2017 \"Modern American Woman\" issue featuring seven models ‚Äî Liu Wen, Ashley Graham, Kendall Jenner, Gigi Hadid, Imaan Hammam, Adwoa Aboah, and Vittoria Ceretti ‚Äî from different ethnic backgrounds. It also put Ashley, a size-16 model, front and center. While the cover garnered praise for its inclusivity, it faced backlash on social media for not being more inclusive. According to commenters, one \"plus-size\" model doesn't make up for the fact that the rest of the women on the cover are around six feet tall and very slim, and that none of the models featured were \"darker than a paper bag.\" Vogue is \"democratizing fashion\" by not including a single woman darker than a paper bag in an \"inclusive\" spread. pic.twitter.com/ein18za44p ‚Äî Evette Dionne (@freeblackgirl) February 8, 2017 This Vogue cover..Am I the only one who thinks it's hilarious how they've used basically the same woman just slightly less white ‚Äî Charlotte (@charlottewalshe) February 8, 2017 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below @voguemagazine While they may be different ethnicities, they all have the same facial features & structure so is that even real diversity?

They pointed out that her arm was the only one resting on a thigh, which arguably covers up her torso. Eagle-eyed Twitter users also thought there was something fishy about the placement of Gigi Hadid's arm and hand ‚Äî a Photoshop tactic they claimed was meant to cover up Ashley's stomach. Wow, they really made her put her arm down. God forbid we see an actual leg-sized leg on the cover of Vogue. https://t.co/g1KT8vNDB8 ‚Äî She Persisted ‚úäüèæ (@divaTy) February 8, 2017 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below so they have ashley graham on the vogue cover but they're hiding her body to make her appear skinnier smh ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T11:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:27:53.544+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
