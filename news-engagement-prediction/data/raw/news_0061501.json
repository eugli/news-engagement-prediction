Close Renshaw retires ill with stomach bug UP NEXT VIDEO Renshaw retires ill with stomach bug. Vid: Fox Sports Renshaw retires ill with stomach bug \nRenshaw raced off the field and to the toilet some 15 minutes before lunch on Thursday, when the much-anticipated series started. \nThere was a quick consultation between the umpires and Steve Smith, who appeared shocked to see Renshaw following dismissed batsman David Warner off the field, before Shaun Marsh walked out. \nIt was unclear if Renshaw, who had showed few signs of discomfort in an impressive unbeaten knock of 36 off 89 balls, was in any state to bat and asked for additional time. \nBorder, who famously told a sick Dean Jones he was a \"weak Victorian\" because he wanted to stop batting during the 1986 tied Test in Chennai, was in disbelief over the situation. Renshaw retired ill. Pic: Getty \n\"I hope he is lying on the table in there half dead. Otherwise as captain, I would not be happy,\" Border said of Renshaw on Fox Sports. \n\"I can't ever think of a situation like that that's happened before, where someone's gone off because they're a bit ill. \n\"He's obviously just got an upset stomach to some degree.\" \nPeter Handscomb walked out to bat following Marsh's dismissal in the second session. Renshaw, however, has remained at the ground and is being monitored. \nThe young opener is expected to bat again on Thursday at some point. \nBorder claimed Renshaw wouldn't have even \"thought about\" coming off if Warner didn't chop a wide ball from Umesh Yadav onto his stumps. \n\"He probably thought he had time to race off the ground and get back on while the new batsman was coming out to the crease,\" Border said. \n\"If Shaun Marsh was dismissed in those last 15 minutes, I would've been ropeable as captain.\" \nBorder was filthy in 1986, when Jones was 202 not out at tea and didn't want to go out and bat, because he was urinating involuntarily and vomiting in extreme heat. Jones went on to score 210 and was later put on a saline drip. \nRenshaw, having never set foot in India before arriving last week, thoroughly impressed with the bat prior to his bathroom break. \nThe 20-year-old's defence was solid but he also stroked five boundaries, including a booming six off left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja.
