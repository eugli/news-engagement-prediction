Steve Johnson championship plays out on the field, the bigger-money game is taking place between the plays. Here is a look at the best, the worst and the just okay, our review of the Super Bowl ads that sponsors paid more than $5 million per 30 seconds to air. \nBudweiser, B+ Budweiser 2017 Super Bowl commercial \nBudweiser's 2017 Super Bowl commercial titled \"Born the Hard Way.\" (YouTube) \nBudweiser's 2017 Super Bowl commercial titled \"Born the Hard Way.\" (YouTube) See more videos \nInstead of presenting another lost puppy improbably saved by Clydesdales, Anheuser-Busch this year plays it much less safe in its big storytelling spot. It tells the tale of founder Adolphus Busch emigrating to St. Louis and meeting Eberhard Anheuser, after first encountering Americans who tell him to “go home,” The boldness of this pro-immigration message, at this moment in our country, makes up for a narrative that’s only moderately compelling. \nMr. Clean, C- Video: Mr. Clean Super Bowl ad \nWatch the Mr. Clean Super Bowl ad. \nWatch the Mr. Clean Super Bowl ad. See more videos \nThis is either an ad about the cleaning product mascot or a promo for an upcoming movie starring Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. I can’t tell those two apart. Assuming it’s the former, I will admit that I’m mostly just creeped out by the housewife leering at the life-size cartoon figure in tight white pants as he spiffs up her home. When Mr. C turns into her schlumpy husband -- if you want a woman way out of your league, millennial guys, grow a beard! -- she pushes him onto the couch for some hanky-panky amid the aroma of cleaning fluids. Um, sexy? Video: Audi Super Bowl commercial \nWatch the Audi Super Bowl commercial. \nWatch the Audi Super Bowl commercial. See more videos \nThe luxury carmaker delivers a paean to gender equality. As his daughter wins a soapbox derby, a dad frets about her growing up in a world where “her dad is worth more than her mom.” They drive off in their $40,000+ car, and we are told that Audi is committed to equal pay, because that’s a stronger message than, say, parent Volkswagen’s tainted commitment to clean diesel. The soapbox derby car, apparently, gets left by the roadside. Video: Michelin Super Bowl ad \nWatch the Michelin Super Bowl ad. \nWatch the Michelin Super Bowl ad.

As “Stay Alive” by Swedish artist Jose Gonzalez plays, Michelin tires deliver people safely where they are needed. The storytelling is unexciting, yet strong and tight, like a good set of tires in a turn. \nIntel, A- Video: Intel Super Bowl ad \nWatch the Intel Super Bowl ad featuring Tom Brady. \nWatch the Intel Super Bowl ad featuring Tom Brady.

Ending with Brady drawing the line at cameras following him into the bathroom, the spot is amusing and vivid in its product demonstration.

This spot is simple, cute and effective. Just don’t think too hard about how the scenario could play out more than once.

That’s pretty much it, except for a tagline with Ernie saying, “Um, that one’s broken.” So the nuts, then, are high in protein and low in advertising ambition. Can we get Stephen Colbert back?

The website-creation service employs Jason Stathan and Gal Godot to rout some baddies in a restaurant while the chef in headphones obliviously refines his Internet presence. It ends with an explosion, and the chef working out of a food truck.
