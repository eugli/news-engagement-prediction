Selva Kumar, a former Penang Free School boy, was courteous and respectful, and never displayed any tendencies to the contrary,” said the neighbour when met at his home in Jalan Sungkai yesterday. \nHe remembered Selva Kumar bringing home a Canadian girl when he came back for a visit in the 1980s. \n“There were only four Indian families living along this road, and it created quite a stir to see a white girl in our midst,” the neighbour recalled. \nA relative said Selva Kumar, 57, was the third among four siblings, having two older brothers and a younger sister. \n“His father died years ago and the mother is very sickly and is being taken care of by the sister,” said the relative who also declined to be named. \nRelated stories:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T06:25:20.858+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
