Customer Reviews by Erin1121 Hilarious! I laughed so hard I was crying. I thought the first book in this series was the best, but this one blew me away. Great writing. Dane by Maime ham I felt like I had turned the television on late one night, only to discover a wonderful love story. The read was so smooth I truly felt it was televised just for me. The characters of Dane, Charlie and Dane's brother made feel like I had known the for the ten year span of the novella. I would recommend this book for anyone who needs, a sweet love story with a good ending. Love it!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T12:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T08:39:25.528+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
