ADVERTISEMENT \nArguelles served the Archdiocese of Lipa for almost 13 years and was vocal in campaigning against mining and other environmental threats to the province of Batangas. \nThe Archdiocese of Lipa has a population of 2,815,235 Catholics. \nGarcera, 58, was appointed bishop of Daet by Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI. \nBorn in Magarao, Camarines Sur in 1959, Garcera completed his seminary training at the Holy Rosary Seminary in Naga City. \nHe was ordained at the Naga Metropolitan Cathedral when he was 24 years old. \nGarcera was the former assistant secretary general of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP). He currently heads the CBCP’s Commission on Family and Life. \nHe also served as the national director of the Pontifical Mission Societies and became a member of the Superior Council of the Pontifical Mission Societies in Rome from 2004 to 2007. \nIn October 2015, Garcera was also among five Filipinos allowed by Pope Francis to attend the historic Synod of Bishops on the Family. \nArguelles welcomed Garcera’s appointment as his successor. \nThe prelate did not disclose the reasons for his resignation, simply saying that he submitted his resignation to the Vatican earlier.
