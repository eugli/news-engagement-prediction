If it does fail it can’t be replaced. Mr Large added: “A crack has developed. It is at a critical level and it has been detected. Like when you have a chip on a windscreen, it is difficult to reliably predict when it will suddenly grow and shatter.” Sources suggested yesterday that the Royal Navy would be “pulling out all the stops” to deploy the boats once more. However, deploying any submarine with such a fault will render it a “lame duck”, as it would be forced to avoid the strain caused by sudden shifts in temperature, or risk catastrophic failure. GETTY The crack cannot be fixed without replacing the entire reactor Mr Large said: “These submarines are hunter killers – they are effectively sports cars required to manoeuvre rapidly. They need to run between ‘State A,’ idling, and ‘State B’, full power battle state, quickly if they are to avoid detection or even torpedo strikes. You cannot do this if there is a crack.” The Trafalgar submarines have had their service extended by 10 years due to ongoing delays in the construction and delivery of the new Astute class. But of Britain’s three Astutes, two are undergoing trials while the third is being repaired after a collision in Gibraltar. In 2013 a Ministry of Defence report revealed two Trafalgar class boats had been operating with a safety defect which put the vessels and crew at “serious” potential risk. Rear Admiral Chris Parry warned: “The SSNs are gatekeepers that detect and protect the UK from intrusive patrols by Russia and other opponents. They also provide vital protection for our Vanguard submarines.

Getty 1 of 17 Defence Secretary Michael Fallon visits HMS Vigilant at HM Naval Base Clyde, also known as Faslane in Scotland “Our deterrent is independent so, if our SSNs are not available, there are limits to what we can ask even the US to do because our Vanguard submarines need to maintain the secrecy of their operations. It does not help that the Government scrapped our Nimrod Maritime Patrol aircraft. “Instead of gatekeepers I suspect that we would have to ask the US to act as linebackers to keep any hostile snooping submarines at a distance.” An MoD spokesman denied that the submarines would be permanently out of action. He said: “It is untrue to suggest that HMS Trenchant or the rest of the T-class subs are unable to deploy again.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T03:28:30.257+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
