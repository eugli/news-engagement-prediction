Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nLooking red-eyed and haunted, Fadi Fawaz leaves home, just hours after the release of the 999 call he made when he found his lover George Michael dead in bed. \nFadi is horrified at the emergence of the tape in which he tells an ambulance call handler: “He’s gone. He’s blue. He’s dead.” \nThe four-and-a-half minute call was made by Fadi after he found the lifeless singer, aged 53, on Christmas Day. \nFadi said: “It’s ­horrifying. What’s going on?” \nA pal added: “Fadi’s heartbroken he’s having to relive the morning he discovered George with the release of this tape.

Fadi Fawaz and George Michael \nHe said: “It’s very hard for all of them, quite intolerable. It’s a shock and terrible for his father. \n“He was looking forward to a happy old age and now all he has is grief. He wants to hold the funeral but so far police are ­refusing to release the body and are looking for further clues. \n“I spoke to him before George died and he told me he wanted to try to bring his son back into his community and change his mindset. \nHe wanted him to become part of the lifestyle of the community and it is possible this would have saved George.” Flowers at George Michael's Highgate house (Photo: Daily Mirror) \nAnother friend, Demetri Louca, revealed: “George’s body is still with the coroner in Oxfordshire. His family are finding the wait intolerable. \n“His body will be there until they have found the cause of death and apparently it is very nearly finished now. \n“They are planning the funeral with the high priest and will announce the date in time and not long. \nThe Greek community is very important to the family and they believe that if George had been part of it this, his sad early death would never have happened.” Musicians George Michael and Sir Elton John (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nPolice are continuing to probe George’s last hours and the moments after he died at home. \nBut his family were rocked by the release of Fadi’s frantic 999 call after finding his lover’s lifeless body in bed. \nIn it, Fadi is unable to quickly give the full postcode of George’s cottage, saying he is “shaking”. \nThe call handler then asks where George’s body is and Fadi replies: “He’s in bed. Dead. He’s cold and he’s blue... yes, he’s very stiff. He’s dead... he’s dead.” Fadi tried to wake George for an hour (Photo: PA) \nFadi reveals he has spent an hour trying to revive him. The operator goes on to ask if George’s death was “expected”. \nFadi replies: “No, no, no, no, no, I’ve been waiting for him to wake him up for like, you know, hours and he wouldn’t wake up. I went to wake him up and he was gone, you know.” \nHe adds: “It’s George Michael, you know, the singer?” \nFadi wrongly gives George’s date of birth as July 25 instead of June 25. The operator tells him the ambulance is on its way and not to move the body.
