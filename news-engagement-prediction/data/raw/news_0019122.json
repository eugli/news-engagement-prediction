He’d seen \"A Different World\" in re-runs, but after hearing the stars talk up higher ed, “now I’m really looking at the show with a new view,” Garrett said. \nRelated: Reports: George and Amal Clooney are expecting twins \nAlthough the comedy's six-season run ended in 1993, it's still drawing laughs in reruns on cable TV and Netflix. \"A Different World,\" a spin-off of “The Cosby Show,” was a likeable riff on the quirky rewards of college life at an imaginary, mostly black Hillman College. \nIn person, the actors who spoke in Taylor — Darryl Bell, who played Ron Johnson; Jasmine Guy, a star of the show in her role as Whitley Gilbert; Kadeem Hardison, whose was known for his flip-up spectacles in the role of Dwayne Wayne; and Charnelle Brown, who played the studious Kimberly Reese — were making one stop in a multi-city tour aimed at getting young African Americans thinking about going to college, according to a news release. Part of the message was that black youths should consider one of the nation’s the historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) that were models for the TV show. The onstage dialogue Wednesday was moderated by Detroit radio talk show host Mildred Gaddis of WCHB 1200 AM. \nHCBUs formed mainly in the aftermath of the Civil War, when blacks were not allowed to attend white colleges and universities. Although HCBUs now are integrated — some have more students of other races than black students — they’re still a great option for African Americans considering higher education, said LaTosha Walker, 37, of Grosse Pointe Woods. \nFormer \"A Different World\" actor Darryl Bell, right, speaks during a \"It's A Different World College Forum\" on Wednesday, Feb. 8, 2017 at Wayne County Community College in Taylor.

The chancellor looks like you. You say to yourself, ‘What do you know? — a black person can run a college,’ and you don't get that anywhere else,” Walker said. She attended Wednesday’s event to gain insights about choosing colleges for her six children and step-children, ages 2 through 21, she said. \nThe popularity of \"A Different World\" has been credited by some college presidents for increasing enrollment numbers at HBCUs during the years the show originally aired. \nWith college graduation rates of African Americans lagging behind those of white students, educators are eager to enroll more blacks in college, said Mawine Diggs, vice chancellor of student services for Wayne County Community College District. Historically black colleges traditionally offered “a strong support system — people looked out for you and noticed if you didn’t go to class,” Diggs said. \n“Now, society has changed and these colleges do have white students — they’re very blended — but I still think they have a lot to offer,” she said. \nIn 2015, a Gallup poll found that black students at HCBUs were twice as likely as black students at other colleges to receive three key supports — a professor who excited them about learning; an effective mentor; and a feeling that their teachers cared about them. \nOn stage Wednesday, the ex-cast members told college aspirants that just as important as choosing a college was choosing the attitude to go with it. \nAs a college freshman, for example, \"You have to decide if you're going to be the type of person who's on time — because if you don't show up on time, you may not be back,\" Guy told the audience. \nThe jovial group chatted about a lot more than college 101, however, including tattoos, body image, what each gender finds attractive in the other, and how relationships have changed since the show was filmed. Back in the day, alluding to her on-screen character, “I never believed he was a gigolo,” quipped Guy, bantering with Hardison, as he threw back his head in laughter. \nContact Bill Laitner: blaitner@freepress.com. \nPoster pitches college to kids at Wayne County Community College (Photo: Bill Laitner, Detroit Free Press) Learn more about HBCUs Hartford 2017 Black College Tour: Sponsored by Hartford Memorial Baptist Church, potential college students will tour colleges in Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia, from April 14- 23.
