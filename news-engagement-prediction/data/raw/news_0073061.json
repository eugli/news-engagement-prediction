That 18th technical would mean a one-game suspension, and it didn't take Cousins very long to hit that mark. \nIn his third game with New Orleans, Cousins was hit with a technical foul after getting tangled up with the Thunder's Steven Adams 32 seconds into Sunday's game. Took 32 seconds for Boogie to receive another technical foul. He will be suspended a game unless this is rescinded. pic.twitter.com/4rbcYHRfE1 â€” Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) February 27, 2017 \nThe league will review the call, and if the technical stands, Cousins will miss New Orleans' game against the Pistons on Wednesday. \nAccording to Elias Sports Bureau , 32 seconds into a game was the quickest technical foul of Cousins' career.
