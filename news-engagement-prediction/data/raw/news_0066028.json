(Source: Twitter) \nA woman named Brianna Olivas has claimed that her iPhone 7 Plus exploded on Saturday and started spewing smoke. She posted a video of the entire incident on social media website Twitter and revealed that the explosion happened even though she wasn’t using the phone. Her tweet read as, “So my iPhone 7 plus blew up this morning ???? was not even using it, literally no explanation for this.” \nThe 21 second video posted on twitter shows flames coming out of the phone and has been viewed over 1.91 million times. More than 25,000 Twitter users have also re-tweeted the video. According to the latest reports, Apple has recovered the phone from the woman and is investigating the issue.

However, the staff told her that everything is okay with the device and the very next day it caught fire. She has also denied using charger of any other company which rules out the possibility of thrid-party damage. \nThe images posted by Olivas has again sparked the debate between Apple and rival company Samsung. Last year, more than 10 reports of Note 7 catching fire were reported forcing the manufacturer to recall all the devices of that series. Some airlines also restricted the use of device in their flights. Later in the year, a man from Australia reported the problem of iPhone 7 catching fire in his car as well. \nImages of the phone after getting fire: \n— Bree✨ (@briannaolivas_) February 23, 2017 \nWith 2017 marking the 10th anniversary for Apple iPhones, a users expecting a big announcement in September, this news comes as major setback for both the parties. There are many rumours about the new phone with some sources saying that it could be named iPhone X instead of iPhone 8.
