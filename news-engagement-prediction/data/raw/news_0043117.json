'Could affect future' \nMr Smith said he thought the initial email from lawyers acting for the hotel, which opened in 1906, was a scam. \nBut he later realised it was serious when a hard copy of the letter arrived in the post.

He's trying to to earn a living. Nobody is going to mistake the Yorkshire Ritz for the one in London.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:02:52.546+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
