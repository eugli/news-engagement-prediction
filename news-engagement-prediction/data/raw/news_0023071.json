The partnership, which begins with the 2017 soccer season, will give San Antonio a direct connection to MLS and its largest market. It will also link the Alamo City’s USL team, San Antonio FC, with a joint ownership entity that includes City Football Group, which counts among its holdings one of Europe’s Manchester City football club. Spurs Sports & Entertainment's USL franchise, San Antonio FC, will enter into a new… more Courtesy of Darren Abate/San Antonio FC Tim Holt , managing director for SAFC, told me this deal has been in the works for several months. “We started phone conversations toward the end of last season,” he said. The two organizations will work together in a variety of capacities. SS&E officials said that collaboration will cover everything from player loans and development to marketing and other areas of business operations. “The biggest thing for us is that there be a shared philosophy on and off the field,” Holt said. “It was pretty clear that we have that with them.” SS&E has created a model for success with the Spurs that other NBA teams have attempted to duplicate. And NYFC could gain some valuable knowledge from its affiliation with SAFC. On the flip side, the parent company of the five-time NBA champions is still cutting its teeth on the soccer pitch, so the deal with NYFC could prove to be timely move for San Antonio in its quest to join MLS. “What this does is open the door,” Holt said. “It lets us learn from a really strong MLS club.” SAFC will kick off its 2017 home schedule on April 1 at Toyota Field against LA Galaxy II.
