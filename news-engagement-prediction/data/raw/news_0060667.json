Missouri’s unemployment rate was at 4.4 percent in December and hasn’t been above 6 percent since 2014, according to the Department of Labor. The Missouri House voted Wednesday to slash the amount of time individuals can claim… more nashvilledino2 The change would take effect beginning Jan. 1, 2018, and would operate on a sliding scale from 13 weeks to 20 weeks. An individual can receive benefits from 13 weeks if the Missouri unemployment rate is below 6 percent, to 20 weeks if the unemployment rate is above 9 percent. Proponents of the bill say it result in savings to the state unemployment fund, while opponents say that 13 weeks is too short a time as laid off union employees are required by contract to work after a layoff and it will be difficult to find a short-term job during that period. The bill is sponsored by Republican Rep. Scott Fitzpatrick .
