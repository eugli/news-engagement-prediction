Minimum fare for jeeps in the National Capital Region and Regions III and IV is now P8. Photo by Joel Liporada/Rappler \nMANILA, Philippines – Commuters are told to seek alternative means of transportation on Monday, February 27, as jeepney operators lead a strike in Metro Manila and select provinces to protest plans to phase out their old fleet. \nIn Metro Manila, jeepney drivers are expected to convene at the Monumento Circle at 6 am and then gather at the Quezon City Elliptical Circle around 11 am, where they will all march towards Mendiola, based on an advisory from the Philippine National Police (PNP). \nJeepney operators led by Pinagkaisang Samahan ng mga Tsuper at Operators Nationwide ( PISTON) are asking the government to drop its plan for stricter regulation of jeepneys, phasing out the old one in their fleet and requiring operators to have at least 10 jeepneys and P7 million minimum capital to keep their franchises. \nThey said the new regulations will lead to the corporate takeover of public transport. \nA similar transport strke earlier in the month caused misery among commuters in the country capital that have depended on the iconic mode of transportation, forcing some schools to cancel classes. \nThe government has yet to announce if it will again provide free rides to help commuters on Monday. The police said the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has met with the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) to address the issue. – Rappler.com HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?
