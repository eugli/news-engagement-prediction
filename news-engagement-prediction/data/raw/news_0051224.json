Ross, is filming Black Panther , and has titles including Cargo – recently sold to Netflix – and Ghost Stories coming up. \nSherlock 's season four finale also drew the show's lowest ever overnight ratings, around 5.9 million tuning in to watch The Final Problem on January 15, down from the 8.1 million who watched the first episode on New Year's Day. \nDespite the falling viewing figures, Gatiss suggested that the storyline felt conclusive enough should the BBC decide to call time on its former ratings juggernaut. \"And obviously we left it in a very happy place,\" he said. \"If that’s the end I’d be very happy where we left it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T16:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:26:19.945+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
