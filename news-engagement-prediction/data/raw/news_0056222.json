In the agreement, the manufacturing of the Iron Dome was moved to the United States, who helped to fund the interceptors production. Rayethon, the American company producing the parts, alongside the Ministry of Defense and the US Missie Defense Agency (MDA), were all apart of producing the improved Iron Dome. Israel continuously improves the technology behind the country’s anti-missile systems, and the last upgrade to the Iron Dome was in 2015 in order \"to expand and improve the performance capabilities of the system in the face of an unprecedented range of threats,\"During the second Lebanese war in 2006, large Israeli cities were struck by missiles for the first time. In response, Former Minister of Defense Amir Peretz decided to develop the Iron Dome, despite opposition from army brass. After a lengthy development process, and with the financial help of the United States, Iron Dome went into service in April 2011, its first battery placed near the southern Israeli city of Beersheba. It made its first interception, of a grad rocket fired from the Gaza Strip just days later. The Iron Dome has been used during two military operations against Hamas, and is able to calculate when rockets will land in open areas, choosing not to intercept them, or towards civilian centers. Since its first deployment, it has intercepted roughly 85 percent of projectiles fired towards Israeli civilian centers. The Rafael-built system carries 24 pounds of explosives and can intercept an incoming projectile from four to 70 kilometers away, changing the face of battle between Israel and her enemies. The system is able to calculate when rockets will land in open areas, and does not intercept them.Israel Aerospace Industries Ltd. which produces the radar system for the Iron Dome system through its ELTA division, has reported sales of it to various armies around the world.Presently, Israel is working on two more missile defense systems - David’s sling and Arrow 3.In January, the Israel Air Force officially took delivery of the first Arrow-3 interceptor. Produced by IAI, the Arrow 3 will form the uppermost layer of Israel’s multilayered defense system along with the Arrow 2, David’s Sling and Iron Dome system. Later in January, Israel’s Missile Defense Organization and the U.S. Missile Defense Agency successfully completed a series of intercept tests of the David’s Sling Weapon System, also developed by Rafael.Together the systems will provide Israel will a protective umbrella able to counter threats posed by both short and mid-range missiles used by terror groups in Gaza and Hezbollah as well as the threat posed by more sophisticated long-range Iranian ballistic missiles.
