Like the Republican party and the Washington DC establishment before it, CPac has become subject to a hostile takeover. This bastion of libertarianism and small-government, free-trade conservatism will this week be forced to reckon with the nationalist populism that has now become the dominant force in rightwing politics in the US. \nPerhaps no one besides Trump represents this strain of thought more clearly than Steve Bannon , the White House chief strategist and former Breitbart boss who will speak today alongside Reince Priebus , the White House chief of staff. The relationship between the upstart firebrand who the Democrats have called a white supremacist and the establishment former RNC chair in many ways symbolises the struggle for control of Trump’s agenda, and the way the two interact on stage will be fascinating to watch. \nOpening the day is another key Trump ally, adviser to the president Kellyanne Conway , who since last year has made a career out of touring the TV studios channelling her master’s voice – and his disregard for the truth. Her coining of the phrase “alternative facts” may come to be remembered as one of the key phrases of post-truth politics, but one senses that despite this and other controversies, Trump probably enjoys and respects her scrappy style and her constant willingness to stick her neck out for him ( and his daughter’s businesses ). \nLater comes education secretary Betsy DeVos , whose performance at her confirmation hearing was judged so weak that Mike Pence was forced to use the vice-president’s Senate casting vote to confirm a cabinet nominee for the first time . Some of the issues that so exercised Democrats – such as her support for spending public money on private schools – will hardly worry this audience, but she may be keen to shift a perception that she has failed to master her brief. \nPence will round out the day – like Priebus a traditional conservative who is likely to use the opportunity to build bridges with his fellow rightwingers by emphasising the elements of Trump’s record so far they will appreciate – his nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the supreme court, for example, or his executive order banning international NGOs from providing abortion services if they receive US funding. \nIn among all these Trump loyalists a former enemy has snuck in: Ted Cruz , who came first in the CPac “ straw poll ” of presidential candidates last year (Trump came third). Of course, Cruz eventually went on to endorse Trump, but not before being booed at the Republican convention for telling delegates to “ vote your conscience ” following a bad-tempered primary campaign in which the two men argued about each other’s wives and Trump infamously suggested Cruz’s father might have been involved in the assassination of JFK. The Texas senator is due to discuss the constitution today, and is likely to be more emollient, although any mention of the separation of powers or freedom of religion is bound to be interpreted as a dig at a president who has shown little appreciation for either. \nTrump will address the conference tomorrow, and some in the crowd may remain to be convinced. As baffling as it may seem on the left, some traditional conservatives still fear their new president is a liberal in sheep’s clothing, who couldn’t care less about their values and ideology and is willing to spend massively and undermine free trade to meet his promises to rust belt voters who want to see manufacturing jobs return and immigration curtailed. Conservatives “don’t think he’d ever read their novel, their policy paper, their magazine article — or even listen to them for more than five minutes,” anti-tax activist Grover Norquist recently told the New York Times . But perhaps it’s more likely they will put aside their differences and make nice with the man who stunned both their party and the country. Nothing succeeds like success. More on that tomorrow. \nToday’s full schedule is here , and below are some of the highlights: 9.10am: Kellyanne Conway interview 9.30am: Discussion: Fake Climate News Camouflaging an Anti-Capitalist Agenda – and What President Trump Plans To Do About It 9.30am: Wisconsin governor Scott Walker explains “How to Govern as a Conservative” 10.05 am: a panel of governors – Walker again, along with Matt Bevin of Kentucky, Sam Brownback of Kansas, and Doug Ducey of Arizona – explain how they are “reclaiming America’s promise” 11.10am: Ted Cruz discusses the constitution 11.10am: Discussion: Fake News and the Lame Stream Media Followed by: Book signing: Liberalism or How to Turn Good Men Into Whiners, Weenies and Wimps, by Burgess Owens 11.30am: Discussion: Always on Target: 2nd Amendment Activism Made Simple 11.40am: Discussion: FREE stuff vs FREE-dom: Millenials’ Love Affair with Bernie Sanders 12.50am: Betsy DeVos – interview 1.05pm: Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon 2.30pm: Discussion: The Popular Vote - Does it Matter & What You Can Do About It 4.40pm: Discussion: Black Lives Matter, so why does the Left not support Law Enforcement? 5pm: Discussion: Russia: A Friend or Foe 7.30pm: Mike Pence", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T15:13:29.620+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
