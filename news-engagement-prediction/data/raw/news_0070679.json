Jones (NC-3) and 37 of his colleagues wrote to President Donald Trump expressing concerns over the Obama Administration’s Clean Power Plan (CPP), Waters of the U.S. (WOTUS), and Ozone Standard of 70 parts per billion (ppb) Rules. After receiving frequent complaints, the representatives hope to overturn or revise the onerous rules, which were promulgated outside of congressional authorization and/or intent. Now that the 60 day period for Congressional Review Act (CRA) has passed to reverse the rules, the members are asking that the Trump Administration look into the matter further. \n“The Obama-era EPA was completely out of touch with the American people,” said Congressman Jones . “These burdensome regulations are hurting farmers, trade, small businesses, and ultimately, the consumer. They should be overturned or revised immediately.” The full letter is attached. For additional information, please contact Allison Tucker in Congressman Walter Jones’ office at Allison.Tucker@mail.house.gov or (202) 225-3415. ###", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T04:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:51:56.273+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
