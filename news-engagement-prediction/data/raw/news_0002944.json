I was upset to leave today if I’m honest with you.” \nHe added: “You don’t get too comfortable. I put on an outfit that I was ready to come out in. I’m sad to come out now, they were very worthy opponents.” \nCalum said the days had started to “drag” inside the house and it had got to the stage where he was thinking it had to come to an end. \n“This time around hasn’t been tougher with the people, it’s been tougher with what Big Brother is bringing to the table.” \nThat means Nicola McLean, Jedward, Kim Woodburn, Bianca Gascoigne, James Cosmo and Coleen Nolan have all made the final.

Comment Below \nEmma explained: “This is the final eviction before the final on Friday and some people are asking how come James Cosmo is up. Well, you’re now voting for your winner so the vote to win is open and that’s why his name is in there as well. \n“Even though it’s an eviction, which is a bit confusing, it’s actually a vote to win from when the vote to win opened.” Emma (and her umbrella) at tonight's live eviction (Photo: Channel 5) The CBB host said it was a tight race when it came to tonight's results (Photo: Channel 5) Emma also spoke to Monday night's evictee, Jamie, during the episode (Photo: Channel 5) Jamie left CBB in a shock secret eviction on Monday (Photo: Channel 5) He was handcuffed and led away (Photo: Channel 5) Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T04:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:16:09.230+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
