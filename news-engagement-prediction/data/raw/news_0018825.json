'Motorists, who are paying in excess of £40 billion a year in overall motoring taxation, will find it incredibly frustrating that they are having to deal with clogged up roads with these provisional figures showing that traffic levels hit an all-time high in 2016. Van traffic is also up by 3.4 per cent, which AA president Edmund King blames on a boom in internet shopping (file photo) 'While the Government has made progress in investing in the strategic road network, motorists will be unforgiving if the same attention isn't given to local roads. 'These record figures show there is a lot of catching up to be done if we are going to keep motorists and the economy moving.' The Campaign for Better Transport (CBT) claimed the figures highlight the need for the Government to encourage people to walk, cycle and use public transport. Congestion and longer journey times are ranked fourth in a list of the biggest concerns among motorists, according to the RAC Sustainable transport campaigner Bridget Fox said: 'Given what we now know about the country's lethal and illegal levels of air pollution, more than ever we must see urgent action taken to halt the growth in traffic levels on our roads.' A DfT spokeswoman said: 'We are taking the big decisions for Britain's future by investing a record £23 billion to get traffic moving and reduce delays. 'Transport doesn't just help people get around, it helps them get on. Roads open up opportunities and vehicles have clocked up a record number of miles in the last year, which is good news for British industry and our economy as a whole.'
