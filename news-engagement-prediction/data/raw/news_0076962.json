(Photo: Bruce Fedyck, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nHours after missing Sunday’s practice with the flu, the Tampa Bay Lightning traded goalie Ben Bishop to the Los Angeles Kings, the teams confirmed Sunday night. \nThe Lightning receive prospect defenseman Erik Cernak, Peter Budaj, a seventh-round pick in 2017 and a conditional pick. Budaj had been the Kings’ No. 1 goalie while Jonathan Quick, who injured himself in the first game of the season and returned Saturday, was out with a groin injury. The Lightning also sent a 2017 fifth-round pick to Los Angeles. \nBishop will become an unrestricted free agent this offseason. The 30-year-old is in the final season of a two-year, $11.9 million deal.Quick has won two Stanley Cups with the Kings, and he has a Conn Smythe as playoff MVP during the Kings' Stanley Cup run in 2011-12 on his resume. It’s unlikely Bishop would take his job, unless Quick’s health is a question mark. \nBishop played in the Stanley Cup final in 2015, when the Lightning lost to the Blackhawks in six games. \nThe Kings are three points out of the final wild card spot in the Western Conference. The Lightning are seven points out. NEVER MISS OUT Sports Stay in the know and in the zone, 7 days a week, with scores, analysis, and in-depth features and commentary.
