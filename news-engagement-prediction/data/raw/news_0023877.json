'Wrecking lives' \nMr Field said: \"People are waiting an extremely long time to get their first payments, and really bad things are happening to people. \n\"I do see people who have always been managers being reduced to tears. \n\"These are people who are have never been in this situation before and have found universal credit is wrecking their lives.\" \nLord Freud, who stepped down from his post in December, said the Department of Work and Pensions had spent the past nine months tackling these issues with housing payments. \nAnd he acknowledged that previously tight deadlines had already slipped by several years. Work began on the programme in 2010. \nBut Lord Freud said the system had to be introduced in order to tackle the fact that the benefit system was an \"over-comfortable safety net\" that kept families trapped on benefits and those who were working \"wondering why they were bothering\". \nHe said once the \"machinery\" of UC was in place, it would be possible to \"play with the parameters\" and get more people working. \nBut he added:: \"I think it will take some decades to optimise what we are building. \n\"We have once in a generation chance to do something like this, and if you do, you have to try to do it, because I think we have an impossible legacy system.\" Payment delays \nA letter to Employment Minister Damian Hinds from the committee said evidence suggests \"there remains much to be done before universal credit is working well for claimants and those organisations working with them\". \n\"We were concerned to hear that universal credit claimants living in rented accommodation are more likely to be in rent arrears than other tenants,\" it added. \n\"Croydon Council told us that rent collection for council tenants in receipt of universal credit has declined from 98% to 72%. \n\"Whereas under 10% of tenants are claiming universal credit, they account for 38% of Croydon's total rent arrears. \n\"Similarly, Halton Housing Trust reported that 920 of its 1,058 tenants claiming universal credit were in arrears. \n\"And while 9% of tenants claimed universal credit, they account for 37% of Halton's rent arrears.\" \nThe letter also expressed concern about delays in payments being made, with the average wait in Croydon being 12 weeks. \nThe committee said the slow pace of change was highlighted by the fact 430,000 people were claiming UC as of December 2016, despite the government originally forecasting it would be six million. \nFull rollout of the benefit is now forecast in March 2022 - 11 years after it was first announced.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T21:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T17:12:43.071+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
