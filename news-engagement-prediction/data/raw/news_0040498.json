Plastic “speed” ropes are more durable than cotton ropes and whip around faster, which will create a more intense workout. They’re also good for doing advanced jump rope moves, like the single leg jump or the alternate foot jump. [2] 2 Measure the rope to your height. It’s important to use a rope that fits your height. To measure the rope: http://pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/d/d9/Jump-Rope-for-Weight-Loss-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/550px-Jump-Rope-for-Weight-Loss-Step-2-Version-2.jpg /f/f9/Jump Rope for Weight Loss Step 2.360p.mp4 Stand in the middle of the rope. The handles should extend to your armpits. If the handles go past your armpits, cut and adjust the length as necessary. 3 Jump on a waxed or wooden floor. This will help to gradually prepare your lower body for the impact of jumping. [3] Don’t jump on hard surfaces like concrete, as this can put stress on your knees and lead to injury. [4] 4 Practice a basic jump. Master the form of the basic jump before you try any variations or tricks. [5] http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/d/df/Jump-Rope-for-Weight-Loss-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/550px-Jump-Rope-for-Weight-Loss-Step-4-Version-2.jpg http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/d/df/Jump-Rope-for-Weight-Loss-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/300px-Jump-Rope-for-Weight-Loss-Step-4-Version-2.jpg /f/f4/Jump Rope for Weight Loss Step 4.360p.mp4 Hold the rope with your hands at hip height and keep your elbows slightly bent. Make sure your upper arms are close to your sides. Roll your shoulders back and down and keep your chest out. Jump one to two inches off the floor, giving the rope just enough space to slip under your feet. Land on the balls of your feet. Keep your elbows close to your sides as you turn the rope. The movement should come from your wrists and forearms, not from your shoulders. Make turns that are no bigger than two inches, as any bigger will cause you to jump too high. [6] Make your jumps small and consistent. Do 10-15 jumps to warm up and get the feel for the basic jump. If you get tired before you finish 15 jumps, drop the rope but keep your arms and legs going. You can work up to using the rope full-time. 5 Jump rope every day for 15-20 minutes. Once you feel comfortable with the basic jump, practice jumping rope once a day. Keep track of how many jumps you can do in 15-20 minutes. [7] http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/0/01/Jump-Rope-for-Weight-Loss-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/550px-Jump-Rope-for-Weight-Loss-Step-5-Version-2.jpg http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/0/01/Jump-Rope-for-Weight-Loss-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/300px-Jump-Rope-for-Weight-Loss-Step-5-Version-2.jpg /3/37/Jump Rope for Weight Loss Step 5.360p.mp4 Don’t sacrifice form for speed. Make sure you keep your elbows in as you turn and you do not jump higher than one to two inches off the ground. [8] 6 Integrate the basic jump into a strength training circuit. This will help you lose weight and get better at jumping rope. Try a 15 minute circuit, once a day, to burn fat and tone your body. You will need a jump rope, a timer, and an exercise mat. [9] Jump rope for 1 minute, with both feet together. Do 20 lunges, 10 per side. Jump rope for 1 minute. Do 10 pushups. Jump rope for 1 minute with both feet together. Do a 30-second plank. Jump rope for 1 minute. Rest for 10 seconds. Repeat this circuit one more time, with a one minute rest between each circuit. Method Doing Variations 1 Do side to side jumps. Hold the jump rope in the correct position. Jump a few inches to your left as you swing your rope. Then, jump a few inches to your right as you swing the rope. Get into a rhythm as you jump from side to side. [10] Practice 10 side to side jumps, or as many as you can do in one minute. 2 Practice alternate foot jumps. Instead of jumping with both feet at once, alternate your feet, as if you are running in place. Keep your knees lifted to the front and try to jump a little higher than 1 inch off the floor. As you land, stay on the balls of your feet. [11] Do 10 alternate foot jumps, or as many as you can do in one minute. 3 Try single leg lift jumps. Begin by jumping only on your right foot. Land softly on the balls of your feet. Then, switch to jumping only on your left foot. Land softly. Keep your shoulders rolled back and your upper body straight as you jump. [12] Continue to do single leg lift jumps, five on each side. Or do as many as you can in one minute. 4 Do a 15 minute jump rope routine. Once you feel you are comfortable with these variations, try to put them all together into a jump rope routine that will burn calories and tone your body. You will need a jump rope and a timer. [13] Start with the basic jump, for one minute. Go into side to side jumps, for one minute. Do alternate foot jumps, for one minute. Finish with single leg jumps, for one minute. Switch legs each time you jump. Repeat this circuit two to three times, with a one minute break between each circuit. Practice this routine once a day to see improvements.
