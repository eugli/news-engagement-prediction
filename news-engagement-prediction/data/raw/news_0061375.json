Bradley Whitford (the dbag from Billy Madison) attacks Ivanka over faith tweet Posted at 10:09 am on February 23, 2017 by Sam J. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nAs Twitchy reported, Ivanka Trump spoke out about religious tolerance on Twitter and was attacked with a gross amount of intolerance … because what else should we expect from the Left at this point. Here is her tweet which offended them so greatly: America is a nation built on the principle of religious tolerance. We must protect our houses of worship & religious centers. #JCC \n— Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) February 20, 2017 \nGosh how dare she call for us to protect our houses of worship, she’s such a monster. \nOh, and speaking of monster … Your father is a racist birther. Steve Bannon an anti-Semitic opportunist. You and your husband are enabling hatred. Fuck your shoes. https://t.co/38MK86msM2 \n— Bradley Whitford (@WhitfordBradley) February 22, 2017 \nYeah, there’s a reason Bradley Whitford always plays a jerk – it just seems to come so naturally to him, right? @WhitfordBradley @madtruthbomber she needs to be quiet.Her own father is the reason people won't buy her brand \n— the pink protagonist (@ProtagonistPink) February 22, 2017 Trending", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:09:50.143+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
