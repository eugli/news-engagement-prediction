He had a .441 on-base percentage and hit 12 doubles.\nThat showing was enough to convince Braves officials that he was ready to move up a level, and he was promoted to Double-A Mississippi on April 30. He remained there until his major league call-up on Aug. 17.\nFor the M-Braves, Swanson hit .261 in 84 games, with eight home runs, 45 RBIs and a .342 OBP.\nAfter his major league call-up, the curly-haired shortstop compiled a .302 batting average, with three homers and 17 RBIs. He had 39 hits, and 11 of them went for extra bases (seven doubles, three home runs and a triple). Those numbers and his charisma leave him poised for matinee-idol status.\nSwanson made his major league debut Aug. 17 against the Twins at Turner Field, when he batted eighth and was 2-for-4 with two singles. He also struck out once in a 10-3 Braves loss.\nHis first hit came on a 1-0 fastball off Kyle Gibson that Swanson hit sharply to right field for a two-out single in the fourth. His second hit was a single to center off another Gibson fastball. That came in the bottom of the ninth with two outs.\nOverall, Swanson hit safely in 25 of the 38 games in which he played. He recorded 12 multi-hit games, including four consecutive games from Sept. 6-10. In that stretch he was 9-for-15 with five runs scored, two home runs and four RBIs.\nSwanson finished the season with four hit streaks of four games and one of three.\nOn Sept. 9 at Turner Field against the Mets, Swanson was 3-for-3, with three singles and an intentional walk and a run scored. He had another three-hit game on Sept. 19, on the road against the Mets. He was 3-for-5 with three RBIs and a run scored. All three hits were single.\nHere’s a look at some other tidbits from Swanson’s season, with the Braves on the verge of spring training: He hit .358 in night games (31, 38-for-106) with three homers and 16 RBIs and hit .043 in day games (seven, 1-for-23) with a double and an RBI. He hit .288 in his 22 games at Turner Field (21-for-73), with one homer, nine RBIs, six doubles and a triple and hit .321 in his 16 road games (18-for-56), with two homers, eight RBIs and one double. He hit .304 off right-handers (34-for-112) and .294 against lefties (5-for-17). He hit .270 with runners in scoring position (10-for-37 with 12 RBIs). He hit .404 with no outs (19-for-47), with two homers and seven RBIs. He hit .271 with two outs (13-for-48), with one homer and six RBIs. He hit .406 ahead in the count (13-for-32) and .212 behind in the count (11-for-52).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T00:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T11:43:03.535+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
