And the league's top players are ready to go. \nMillions of Americans are desperately looking for a distraction, something to argue about, something to obsessively tweet about besides you-know-who. And so fans will converge Sunday for festive gatherings, fueled by troughs of guacamole and — if you're in my living room — a hefty pile of bacon treats. \n\"Puppy Bowl XIII,\" America needs you. \nIn my house, resident \"Puppy Bowl\" superfans Henry Nipper (\"Team Ruff all the way!\") and Scout Licker (\"Team Fluff for the win!\") have already secured their premium seats on the couch for the 2 p.m. CST broadcast. As always, we humans will merely be there to serve them. \nA creation of the Animal Planet cable network, the \"Puppy Bowl\" quickly became a hit after its debut in 2005, with about 10 million viewers tuning in for each game in recent years, according to Nielsen. The action features dozens of adoptable puppies — \"linebarkers\" and \"wide retrievers\" — from rescue groups and animal shelters throughout the U.S. playing a fake game of football. \nBut this year we're offering extra \"atta boys\" to Animal Planet for including three special-needs dogs in the lineup: Lucky, a three-legged terrier mix; Doobert, a deaf English pointer; and Winston, a vision- and hearing-impaired Australian shepherd. \nAnd I like to think that if it were up to Henry Nipper and Scout Licker, who are both blind, Winston would win the trophy for MVP (most valuable pup, of course) — and millions of viewers would be inspired to adopt a dog with a disability. \nWhen I met Scout at the PAWS Chicago adoption center in 2012, he'd just been relinquished by an owner who could no longer care for him. I don't know his back story, only that he was about 8 and had just had his second eye surgically removed. The vets figured he'd been blind most of his life. \nAt animal shelters, most families look past old blind guys such as Scout. But my boyfriend, Mark, was taken by the fluffy Pomeranian mix (still wearing his \"cone of shame\" after eye surgery) and suggested we meet the pup. PAWS staff took us to a back room where we could pet him, and it was love at first lick. After a trial \"fostering\" period to see if he'd adapt to my home, I signed the adoption papers and made a mental note: Don't rearrange the furniture. \nScout settled in fabulously, mapping out his new world with his nose, bumping into a few walls along the way — and always, always having endless licks to give. \nA few years later, a friend who occasionally fosters animals for the Michiana Humane Society in Michigan City, Ind., mentioned to Mark that she'd taken in a pregnant dog whose litter of five puppies included one without eyes. She wasn't sure what would happen to the blind puppy. If it wasn't chosen for adoption, he might be euthanized. Could we help? \nOn a warm autumn weekend, we drove out to our friend's farm in LaPorte, Ind., to meet the little blind guy, still only about 6 weeks old. We took Scout, too, to see if they'd get along. They did. We all did. And by dinnertime, the puppy became Henry and we'd become the seeing-eye humans for two playful eyeless pups. Within a few days, it was obvious he'd need \"Nipper\" as a second name.

I suppose if you were someone bent on rearranging your furniture every few weeks, it'd be tough. But we're not, so Scout and Henry feel confident to run and play at home. And we're constantly amazed by their ability to navigate new spaces. \nWe've watched Henry race with his puppy energy around my living room, ducking and dodging chair legs as if he has a sixth sense for their presence. Maybe he does — some emerging science suggests that blind animals develop echolocation, navigating like bats and dolphins by using bouncing sound waves to keep track of their environment. \nMy 7-year-old nephew says he has \"brain eyes.\" I like that explanation. \nBoth dogs are people-lovers, perhaps appreciating human touch even more because it's how we connect with them. Scout, especially, has become a snuggler in his old age. Now about 13, he's lost his hearing too, so those extra belly rubs he seems to crave must feel reassuring. \nI've long been an animal lover, but until Henry and Scout came along I rolled my eyes at the over-the-top attention pets get these days — often more for the amusement of the pet owner than the pet. But now? Yes, Henry Nipper and Scout Licker have Facebook profiles. \nWhat started as a way for me to post endless photos of Scout on a separate account — to avoid boring my regular social media friends — led to an account for Henry too. What was unexpected was how many people started following both of them and posting pleas for more \"inspiring posts,\" especially during the long presidential campaign. \"No matter how bad my day is or how bad the news is,\" one Facebook \"friend\" posted recently, \"watching Henry makes me smile.\" \nFor all the cynicism in the world, it's nice to be reminded that a simple tale of a dog, or two, overcoming adversity might help someone. \nSo, on Sunday, along with other modern-day football fans everywhere, Henry Nipper and Scout Licker will be back on the couch, begging for bacon treats — and cheering especially hard for Doobert, Lucky and Winston. \nLara Weber is a member of the Tribune Editorial Board. \nTwitter @lweber", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T06:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:35:19.459+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
