I’ll raise money for you.” Mr. Piscopo has not done any of his own polling or started putting together a campaign staff. The bedrock of his policy centers largely on ideas to “bring back jobs,” a phrase familiar to anyone paying attention to the 2016 campaign.

Credit Chris O'Meara/Associated Press Mr. Piscopo has formed the skeleton of a platform: a focus on increasing manufacturing for distressed communities; resuscitating the state’s once-booming pharmaceutical industry; a property tax cap; using public-private partnerships to rebuild the state’s infrastructure; eliminating the state income tax for teachers, firefighters and the police; and, with his show business roots, working to “make Atlantic City the film capital of the Northeast.” “We’re trying to put a package together that we’ll probably have within the month,” he said. Despite a relatively conservative platform, Mr. Piscopo is very pro-union. During a dinner of steak tartare and pizze at Vaucluse on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, Mr. Piscopo listened to pitches from two businessmen, Richard Patton, a senior vice president at Aon Risk Solutions, and David Galardi, a vice president at Apogenics, a health care adviser, who talked about partnerships with China on infrastructure and promoting generic drug production in New Jersey. Mr. Piscopo interjected only to demand, “Got to be union in New Jersey.” While he doesn’t have official advisers, he has been getting counsel from Mark Serrano, a veteran political operative and friend whom he met in the green room at Fox News. Mr. Serrano said his recommendations had focused on the semantics of campaigning and not style. Mr. Piscopo’s manner is perhaps not that of a traditional would-be candidate, but that is precisely what could help him. “I think that’s what provides him potential in a statewide race like the governor’s race this year,” Mr. Serrano said. Mr. Piscopo pointed to Mr. Trump’s victory as upending the notion of a candidate needing political experience. It was on the Trump campaign trail that Mr. Piscopo started to seriously consider running, saying he received encouragement from Reince Priebus, then chairman of the Republican Party and now Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, and from the former New York City mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story He is also courting the Trump support network. Mr. Piscopo has appeared on “The Alex Jones Show,” a conservative, conspiracy-laden radio program, to discuss a possible run, displaying notes of Trumpian bluster, though delivered with less anger — he declared the Internal Revenue Service a “criminal organization” and mocked Hillary Clinton’s coughing. Mr. Piscopo dialed in to the show from the living room of Roger Stone, a Trump confidant and Republican operative. If nothing else, a run by Mr. Piscopo could provide a jolt of energy and national media attention to what has become a sprawling but relatively unknown field of candidates, a fact not lost on a man familiar with both the highs and lows of celebrity life. “Brother, my life, the one thing is this: If you want an interesting race in New Jersey, I better go in, because I got more baggage,” Mr. Piscopo said with a laugh, before interrupting himself and acting out a mock news conference. “‘Mr. Piscopo, you ran off with the babysitter?’” he said, playing the role of a reporter. “‘Yes, I did. Have you seen her? You would have ran off with her, too. Next question.’ Boom! I’m not going to worry about it.” He is also ready to to break out Ol’ Blue Eyes for the right moment. “I’ll tell ya, if I do win,” he said, laughing as he dropped his voice half an octave to match Mr. Sinatra’s, “I will be the one singing ‘My Way,’ at the inauguration.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T17:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T12:18:45.592+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
