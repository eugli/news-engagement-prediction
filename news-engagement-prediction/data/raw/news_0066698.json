Revealed by TechnoBuffalo, the Galaxy S8 specs list that we're talking about looks almost identical to the one for the S8+, with a single notable and expected difference. While the S8+ sports a 6.2-inch Quad HD+ Super AMOLED display, the S8 comes with a 5.8-inch display (of the same technology and pixel resolution). Both screens are slightly curved on the left and right sides. Just like the Samsung Galaxy S7 series, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are dust- and water-resistant devices (IP68 certified). They've got iris scanners, 4 GB of RAM, 64 GB of expandable internal memory, wireless charging, and a pair of 12 MP and 8 MP cameras (rear and front, respectively). It looks like customers will also get AKG-tuned earphones in the retail box. What's curiously missing from the specs sheets of the Galaxy S8 and S8+ is information about the phones' processors. However, rumors and educated guesses tell us that the handsets should be powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 in the US, and by Samsung's own Exynos 9 8895 in other markets. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ could be officially announced on March 29 , and launched several weeks later, on April 21 . Which of the two models do you think you'll want to own?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:01:53.748+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
