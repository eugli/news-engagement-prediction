(photography by Harry Hayes) \nImagine you're stranded on a remote outstation in heavy monsoonal rain, your car is bogged, you're running low on food - and then, the unthinkable happens. \nIn January 2015 as the wet season dumped heavy rain across the Kimberley, the Carter family decided to leave their remote property at Wungu, south of Halls Creek. Image: Some members of the Carter family on the 18-kilometre driveway. (photography by Harry Hayes) \nTheir way was blocked as the 'black soil' that lines an 18-kilometre driveway to Wungu turned to thick sludge, bogging their Toyota, and making the road impassable. \nIt was then that one of the younger members of the family, a 20-year old man, died in sudden and unexplained circumstances. \nThe young man's death is the subject of a coronial investigation so we can't speculate on what happened. \nBut, we are interested in how the family's pleas to be evacuated were dealt with by WA Police. Image: The Carter family on the porch at Wungu. (photography by Harry Hayes) \nThe story raises questions about what people in remote communities might expect in the event of a family tragedy during a weather event, and how police assess risk and imminent danger arising from psychological trauma, like sudden death and grief. \nHarry Hayes went to Wungu to meet the Carter family and to investigate their complaint against WA Police. \nAnd a warning - this feature includes the name of a young man who is now deceased.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T20:22:06.099+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
