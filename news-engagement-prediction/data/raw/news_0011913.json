Joe Scarpelli / Global News   \nOfficials said a “potentially crippling snowstorm” continues to affect several areas, including Crowsnest Pass, Pincher Creek and Waterton Lakes National Park. \nSnow is forecast to be the heaviest on Sunday and the first half of Monday. \nMore than a metre of snow may fall is expected in some areas, particularly in and near the higher terrain of southwestern Alberta, according to EC. \nTotal amounts of snow on the low end are forecasted to be 35 cm by Monday evening. \nSince Friday, close to 60 cm of snow has been measured at Castle Mountain Resort. \n“It’s possible we might receive upwards of a 100 to 130 cm in total. We’re pretty much two thirds of the way there now,” Cole Fawcett, from Castle Mountain Ski Resort, said Sunday afternoon. “So fingers crossed for a little bit more.” \nREAD MORE: Castle Mountain Resort closes for winter due to warm weather, lack of snow \n“When we announced that the red chair was open after avalanche control measures were conducted this morning, the day lodge erupted in chants and roars. It was fantastic,” said. \n“With this much now, our control team works tirelessly from before morning light to make sure the mountain is safe for all of our guests,” Fawcett said. \nHighways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow, so travel is not recommended and road closures are expected. \n“This is a storm that will likely make travel difficult or impossible for a few days in some areas,” Environment Canada stated. “Winter Storm Warnings are issued when a major snowfall (25 cm or more within a 24 hour period) is expected.” \nOfficials said visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow and poor weather conditions are likely to contribute to long traffic delays. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T06:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T02:06:08.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
