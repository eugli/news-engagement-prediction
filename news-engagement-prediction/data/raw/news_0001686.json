Most are virtual prisoners inside their homes, having abandoned school and work as a result of the threats and beatings.\nCentral America's rampant violence fuels an invisible refugee crisis Read more\n“Every extra day that passes is another day that these youngsters have managed to stay alive. The situation is very dramatic. Some are so scared to go out that they’re not getting enough sunlight,” said Vinicio Sandoval of GMIES, a group working with the victims in San Salvador.\nTrump has frequently berated Mexico for what he says is a failure to crack down on immigration, but he has so far failed to mention Central America, the starting point for most migrants who reach the southern US border.\nThe unfolding humanitarian disaster in Central America has forcibly displaced hundreds of thousands of people in the past few years, but has failed to attract anything like the global attention given to the refugee crisis in Europe.\nA surge in unaccompanied children, especially young teenagers fleeing dangers such as forced gang recruitment, sexual slavery and extrajudicial killings, at the US border was described as a humanitarian crisis by Barack Obama in June 2014.\nThe response was largely punitive: millions of dollars were funnelled to Mexico to fund efforts to detain and deport Central Americans before they could reach the US . Almost 80,000 children have been detained by Mexican immigration agents in the past two years; another 100,000 have survived people traffickers, corrupt officials and kidnappers to make it to the US border.\nAmid criticism from human rights groups, CAM was introduced to provide a safe way for selected victims under 21 to enter the country and reunify them with parents already legally resident in the US.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest In 2014, a Guatemalan migrant, Gladys Chinoy, 14, waited after a freight train suffered a minor derailment, leaving her stranded for more than 12 hours in a remote wooded area in Mexico. Photograph: Rebecca Blackwell/AP\nSo far, 1,800 people have been allowed into the US as refugees or parolees – a lower level of protection – including some infants.\nThe vast majority are from El Salvador, where murder rates have surged to civil war levels in the past two years . In 2014 and 2015, at least 60,000 children left the country or dropped out of school because of violence, according to education ministry figures. El Salvador has a population of six million.\nThe refugee ban means as many as 9,000 youngsters whose CAM applications are currently under consideration, or who have been accepted but are awaiting permission to travel to the US, now find themselves in legal limbo.\nTrump’s blanket ban triggered widespread condemnation, with protests erupting in cities across the world. As well as singling out seven mainly Muslim countries, Trump’s far-reaching directive also cut by more than half the annual cap of refugees to be accepted by the US, from 110,000 to 50,000.\nYet activists say refugees seeking asylum in the US are already subject to stringent security assessments.\n“Entering the US as a refugee is the most difficult way of entering this country – the process can take up to 36 months and [already] involves screenings from 12 to 15 agencies including the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, and CIA,” said Jennifer Sime, head of US programmes at the International Rescue Committee , which helps resettle refugees.\nOnce the programme reopens, there could be further delays depending on what additional security clearances are imposed.\nWendy Young, president of Kind (Kids in Need of Defense), which works with unaccompanied child migrants and refugees in the US, said: “These children need our protection. They are fleeing from horrific gang and narco-related violence which their governments cannot control. They’re not a terrorism risk, and the irony is that they’re already the most vetted of all migrants.”", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Thousands%20of%20young%20Central%20Americans%20at%20risk%20as%20refugee%20ban%20halts%20key%20program&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2017%2Ffeb%2F02%2Fcentral-america-young-refugees-cam-trump-travel-ban%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_tw%26page%3Dwith%3Aimg-2%23img-2", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fba5bb91f3d18144dd6ad6cb6e53e99243a7823b/0_176_4348_2608/master/4348.jpg?w=605&q=20&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&dpr=2&s=b676635568e869b982be382c5c498aeb", "https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/08/04/020816migrationweb3_small.3gp", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2017%2Ffeb%2F02%2Fcentral-america-young-refugees-cam-trump-travel-ban%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_fb%26page%3Dwith%3Aimg-2%23img-2&picture=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2Ffba5bb91f3d18144dd6ad6cb6e53e99243a7823b%2F0_176_4348_2608%2F4348.jpg", "https://gu.com/p/4phpq", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29d8efa9b7824de7363c38e89860a769be5fab3a/0_0_1920_1080/1920.jpg?w=640&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=a43d20246e1335dacd3a27dd70da7281", "http://sas-space.sas.ac.uk/6438/1/Agenda%20Internacional_DJCantor.pdf", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fba5bb91f3d18144dd6ad6cb6e53e99243a7823b/0_176_4348_2608/master/4348.jpg?w=620&q=20&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&dpr=2&s=a520a5c309f7ec0aca30f0499b62f828", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fba5bb91f3d18144dd6ad6cb6e53e99243a7823b/0_176_4348_2608/master/4348.jpg?w=445&q=20&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&dpr=2&s=63be23d9092b005e4f0da36fdcbe5a3c", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fba5bb91f3d18144dd6ad6cb6e53e99243a7823b/0_176_4348_2608/4348.jpg?w=700&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=373ca8fc08f044ca5c13d0c344259c11", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fba5bb91f3d18144dd6ad6cb6e53e99243a7823b/0_176_4348_2608/master/4348.jpg?w=605&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=14b79356e5932b9fd8a6b78ae3342725", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=%27If%20you%20come%20back%2C%20we%27ll%20kill%20you%27%3A%20Central%20Americans%20seek%20refuge%20in%20US%20only%20to%20be%20sent%20home%20%E2%80%93%20video&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2Fvideo%2F2016%2Faug%2F04%2Fcentral-american-refugees-us-mexico-border-video&media=", "https://www.uscis.gov/CAM", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fba5bb91f3d18144dd6ad6cb6e53e99243a7823b/0_176_4348_2608/master/4348.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=bb36441964d6ce136873976faf0bbb6a", "https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/04/020816migrationweb3.m3u8", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=", "https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/08/04/020816migrationweb3_large.3gp", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fba5bb91f3d18144dd6ad6cb6e53e99243a7823b/0_176_4348_2608/master/4348.jpg?w=445&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=2fc97f3e875f276fd5b37ba4bb9e2295", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Thousands%20of%20young%20Central%20Americans%20at%20risk%20as%20refugee%20ban%20halts%20key%20program&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2017%2Ffeb%2F02%2Fcentral-america-young-refugees-cam-trump-travel-ban%3Fpage%3Dwith%3Aimg-2%23img-2&media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2Ffba5bb91f3d18144dd6ad6cb6e53e99243a7823b%2F0_176_4348_2608%2F4348.jpg", "https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/04/020816migrationweb3_desk.mp4", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fba5bb91f3d18144dd6ad6cb6e53e99243a7823b/0_176_4348_2608/master/4348.jpg?w=300&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=a9944f66dd42a3183bb9db527319fbc6", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2Fvideo%2F2016%2Faug%2F04%2Fcentral-american-refugees-us-mexico-border-video&picture=", "https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/04/020816migrationweb3_V4.webm"], "published": "2017-02-02T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T13:16:21.307+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
