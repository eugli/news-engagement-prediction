I could not imagine anything else. It really hit me when I graduated high school, you sign everybody's yearbook and everybody asks you, 'So what college are you going to?' Uh... 'Hey Al, I think we better stick to what we know.'\" \nFoundation president Felice Mancini stated: \"It’s the gift that keeps on giving. The kids share the guitars, they learn, they graduate and then the instruments stay in the school.\" \nThe gift ensures that children receiving the generous donation by the rock legend will be given the chance to shred while promoting the arts. \n\"Music is such a necessity. It touches people's souls,\" Eddie Van Halen told CNN. \"Music is the universal language to me. It transcends everything.\" \nVan Halen is currently not on tour but we'll keep you posted on when they do here on AXS.com .
