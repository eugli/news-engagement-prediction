YouTube The national offices of the Anti-Defamation League in New York received a bomb threat from an anonymous caller. New York City Patch reported that the threat was called into ADL’s Manhattan headquarters at about 11:08 a.m. Wednesday, according to police. Neither the report nor the ADL said whether the building was evacuated. Three days earlier, 11 Jewish community centers across the country were evacuated after bomb threats were called in — the fourth wave of such threats in five weeks. The threats turned out to be hoaxes but forced the evacuation of many buildings. Two days ago, up to 200 headstones were overturned at a St. Louis-area Jewish cemetery. “While there is no information at this time to indicate that this is more than a threat, we are taking it very seriously,” ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement. “We are working with law enforcement officials to determine if it is connected to similar threats against Jewish institutions across the country. “This is not the first time that ADL has been targeted, and it will not deter us in our efforts to combat anti-Semitism and hate against people of all races and religions.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:23:46.950+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
