Relative to the animals’ 3mm height and the average human height the termite mounds are the equivalent to four of the world’s tallest structure, the Burj Khalifa skyscraper in Dubai, stacked on top of each other. \nLittle was known about the termites’ origins until this research, said Associate Professor Nathan Lo, the co-lead author of the paper from the University of Sydney. Humans arrived in Australian interior 49,000 years ago, archaeologists believe Read more \nDNA sequencing showed that today’s cathedral termites descend from the first “nasute termites” to arrive in Australia up to 20m years ago from Asia or South America. \n“It’s a strange result but we’re very confident about it,” said Lo. “The closest relatives of these mound-building termites in Australia are actually tree-nesting termites that live in Asia and South America.” \nHe believed that termites arrived in Australia after crossing long distances of ocean on plant matter, following tsunamis or large storm events. The researchers found this colonisation had happened three times in the past 20m years. \nThese first settlers also lived in trees in coastal areas but over time began to build mounds on the ground and feed on litter and grass as they adapted to the arid conditions of northern Australia.

Now we know it’s more likely that within the last 10m years that they’ve popped up. They weren’t always there. \n“They evolved here relatively recently due to ancient climate change.” \nThe study, published on Wednesday in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters, was led by the University of Sydney in collaboration with Purdue University in the United States, the CSIRO National Research Collections Australia, the University of Western Australia and the University of New South Wales.
