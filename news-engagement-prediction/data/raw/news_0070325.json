Jones , USA TODAY 10:32 a.m. ET Feb. 24, 2017 \nThere’s at least one event Issa Rae’s publicist doesn’t have to drag her to: The Essence Black Women in Hollywood Awards . \nThe Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl and Insecure creator was feted at the 10th anniversary of the annual Oscar-week soiree and took home the vanguard award Thursday night — but not before regaling the crowd with the tale of her first time attending the gala. \nThis is so Issa. (Photo: Richard Shotwell, Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP) \n“I remember the day distinctly,” she said. “It was four years ago and I was fresh off Season 2 of Awkward Black Girl and I was already nervous because I had to go to the event by myself, which, um, awkward black girls don’t like to do.” \n“I remember arriving and standing in the red-carpet line and the woman in front of me turned around and it was Sanaa Lathan, y’all,” Rae said. \n“So, Sanaa turned and she smiled at me but, um, I looked down and instead of saying something, I immediately texted my younger brother and sister because I knew they’d understand,” she continued. “And my sister wrote something back like, ‘Say something to her!’” \nWhich Rae apparently read as “run,” and she did — straight to the press line. \nHowever, the writer/actress/producer joked that she eventually decided to “stop being a punk” and got back in the line for the red carpet, where Niecy Nash gave her an encouraging wink. \n“So, I got to the red carpet and I was ready,” Rae said. \"I gave the carpet publicist my name and he announced, ‘Issa Rae, everybody!’ And I took a deep breath and then I stepped onto the carpet, hand on my hip, ready for the cameras and no sooner than five seconds (after) I stepped on the carpet, they were like, ‘OH, LAILA ALI!’” \n“And so, they all turned to this gorgeous goddess and I stood in the middle of the carpet, like, not sure what to do. So, a kind photographer helped me. He said, ‘Hey, can you move? I’m trying to get Laila.” \nFortunately, that first time wasn't enough to keep Rae away. Jokes aside, she maintained: \"It really is the most genuine event.\" Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T22:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T17:41:42.924+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
