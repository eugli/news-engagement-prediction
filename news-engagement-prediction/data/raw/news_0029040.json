Had she ever received any information to cast doubt on the appropriateness of that trust in Dr. Nassar, she would have reacted immediately to protect her gymnasts.\" Play NOV. 23: Olympic Gymnastics Doctor Arraigned for Sex Abuse 1:41 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/815691843798\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \nTwo weeks ago, Klages was named in court papers filed by a former gymnast who claimed that Nassar repeatedly molested her from 1997 to 1999 during invasive treatments while she was training in an MSU youth sports program. \nThe plaintiff, who is using a Jane Doe pseudonym, alleged that she went to Klages with her concerns about Nassar's treatments and was told that she must be \"misunderstanding\" his procedures. \n\"Klages explained that she had known Nassar for years and could not imagine him doing anything questionable,\" the complaint says. \n\"Klages explained that she [Klages] could file something, but that it would have serious consequences for Plaintiff and for Nassar. This conversation left Plaintiff feeling intimidated, embarrassed, and scared, and caused Plaintiff to believe that nothing illegal or tortious was happening.\" \nRelated: Sex-Abuse Accusers Sue Gymnastics Doctor Larry Nassar \nIn a new round of court papers filed Tuesday, another former gymnast alleged that Klages asked her around the same time if Nassar was performing vaginal procedures on her. When the teenager said he was, Klages allegedly told her there was \"no reason to bring up Nassar's conduct.\" \nIn the statement, Klages' attorney said the coach is \"extremely distressed by the accusations\" and is fully cooperating in all investigations. \n\"The underlying accusations involving Ms. Klages have been a serious distraction to her professional responsibilities and detrimental to her overall well-being. Her recent suspension as head coach is a consequence of that,\" the statement said. \n\"Out of respect to the University and the gymnastics program in particular, Ms. Klages believes it is in everyone's best interests for her to retire from her current position at MSU.\" Play ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T05:20:13.479+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
