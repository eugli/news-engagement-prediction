Some of this is burned at the power plant to produce electricity and some is refined and added to the national grid, where it is used in homes for central heating. And some of the power is sold to the firm Good Energy, which supplies tens of thousands of homes. A small proportion of the gas is sold to Sainsbury’s to heat supermarkets. Wyke Farms, Good Energy and Sainsbury’s all insist they are strong supporters of animal welfare and would not condone any kind of cruelty. The group that filmed it, Viva, has reported its findings to inspectors at the Government’s local Animal Health Office Yesterday, after an investigation triggered by Daily Mail inquiries, Wyke said it was reviewing whether to continue accepting slurry from the farm (pictured) Yesterday, after an investigation triggered by Daily Mail inquiries, Wyke said it was reviewing whether to continue accepting slurry from the farm. Viva’s undercover footage from the farm appears to show that the only mental stimulation for the pigs, which are intelligent animals, are chains hanging from the ceiling. The group has reported its findings to inspectors at the Government’s local Animal Health Office. Viva’s Mr Kerswell said: ‘Many consumers who avoid meat or factory-farmed products will rightly be shocked that their homes are being heated by what can only be described as legalised animal abuse. ‘The pigs at Lambrook Farm are condemned to a short life living among their own waste, and sometimes with the dead. The very bare minimum has been done to remain inside the law, but the conditions are appalling.’ JMW Farms, which rents the land for its pig farm from Wyke, did not respond to requests for a comment. Wyke said only a tiny proportion of the gas and electricity it produces at its green power plant – less than 1 per cent – is created from slurry from the Lambrook pig unit. The company said JMW had informed it that the film footage does not accurately reflect the conditions the pigs are kept in. Justin Kerswell, from Viva, said that consumers who avoid meat or factory-farmed products will be shocked that their homes are being heated by 'legalised animal abuse' Wyke said only a tiny proportion of the gas and electricity it produces at its green power plant – less than 1 per cent – is created from slurry from the Lambrook pig unit (pictured) The firm said the farm ‘passed’ an audit by inspectors from the Red Tractor farm and food standards group on Friday. Despite this, Wyke is reviewing whether to allow the pig farm to continue operating and supplying slurry to its plant. Wyke said that the vast majority of the organic material used in the power plant comes from its own dairy waste. This is supplemented by waste bread, straw and apple pomace, which is the material left after the juice is extracted. Good Energy, which boasts that it offers ‘kinder, better, more natural energy that helps protect what matters to you’, said it takes electricity but no biogas from the plant. A spokesman said: ‘We are very concerned to hear of alleged animal mistreatment at a farm from which Wyke Farms takes waste. ‘We have no contractual relationship with JMW. We have asked Wyke Farms to conduct an investigation into this immediately.’ Sainsbury’s said it ‘would not hesitate to take the appropriate steps if any supplier is found to be in breach’ of its welfare standards. Green campaigners and the Government support efforts to turn waste into power because it can help cut the UK’s reliance on fossil fuels and cut carbon emissions.
