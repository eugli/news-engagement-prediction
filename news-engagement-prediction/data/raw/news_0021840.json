Kim Hong-Ji / Reuters Samsung issued a massive recall for its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones after instances of the product's batteries catching fire. \nThe Korean company called the fire “minor” and said that it didn’t affect production. Video posted on social media showed black plumes of smoke rising from a building. No injuries were reported. \nSince the Galaxy Note 7 debacle, Samsung has worked to assure the public that its products are safe. \nLast month, the company released the results of a lengthy investigation that revealed design flaws in two different sets of its batteries. Those flaws caused the products to heat up to dangerous levels, they said. \n“Today, more than ever, we are committed to earning the trust of our customers through innovation that redefines what is possible in safety, and as a gateway to unlimited possibilities and incredible new experiences,” Dongjin Koh, Samsung’s president of mobile, said at the time.
