(AFP File Photo) \nMumbai attack mastermind and JuD chief Hafiz Saeed has been listed under Pakistan’s anti-terrorism act by the provincial Punjab government, a tacit acknowledgement of his links to militancy. \nDawn News reported that the Punjab government has included names of Saeed and one of his close aides, Qazi Kashif, in the fourth schedule of the Anti-terrorism Act (ATA). \nThree other men were also added to the list –- Abdullah Obaid from Faisalabad, and Zafar Iqbal and Abdur Rehman Abid from the Markaz-i-Taiba, Muridke. \nSaeed and the four men added to the fourth schedule of the ATA were also placed under house arrest on January 30 in Lahore amid an angry uproar from his party and political allies. \nThe five men were identified by the interior ministry as “active members of the Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) and Falah-i- Insaniyat (FIF),” the report said. \nThe ministry directed the Counter Terrorism Department to “move and take necessary action” against them. \nThe names of Saeed and 37 other JuD and FIF leaders had earlier also been placed on the Exit Control List (ECL), barring them from leaving the country.
