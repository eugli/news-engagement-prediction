Patel’s hair ties for the No. 1 spot. \nEmma Stone , as the presumptive Best Actress winner for La La Land, came dressed not in stars this time, but gold Givenchy. \nLoving’s Ruth Negga , who is nominated for Best Actress, sports a custom red Valentino gown, oozing Victorian ghost, with maybe the most political accessory: a blue ACLU ribbon, which Lin-Manuel Miranda and Karlie Kloss are also proudly wearing. \nFor Negga, in particular, the ACLU is key to the story behind Loving. The non-profit organization supported interracial couple Richard and Mildred Loving (whom Negga plays in the film) in 1958 when the pair fought Virginia’s anti-miscengenation law, in hopes of legally marrying. \nIn the most nude dress without going remotely nude, red carpet veteran Nicole Kidman arrived wearing beaded Armani with her red lips popping. \nIf there is any couple that nabs best dressed year in and year out, it’s Chrissy Teigen and her husband John Legend , who giggled and flirted their way across the carpet tonight, wearing a white Zuhair Murad gown and black Gucci tuxedo, respectively. Legend dubbed Teigen “a goddess.” Obviously. \nNext up in the couples department is regular stunner Pharrell Williams and producing partner Mimi Valdes (not wife Helen Lasichanh, who is home with the couple’s twins, born earlier this year). Regular Karl Lagerfeld clotheshorse, Williams is dressed in head-to-toe Chanel, including a custom-made black wool tail coat, trousers, necklace and, of course, bow-tie. Doing it right. \nKirsten Dunst ‘s black Dior gown has pockets. Pockets! Case closed. \nTaraji P. Henson ‘s Alberta Ferretti black dress easily sashayed its way on to this list thanks to her Grade A posing all over the carpet, oozing Cookie. Make this woman an Oscar statue. \nLeslie Mann walked straight out of a fairytale – possibly Beauty and the Beast’s Belle? – on to the carpet in her yellow Zac Posen dress. \nIt seems fitting to open this list with Emma Stone and close it with her La La Land co-star Ryan Gosling . Speaking of the men owning the carpet, Gosling regularly stuns, this year in a Gucci suit.
