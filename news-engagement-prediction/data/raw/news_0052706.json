However, Dr Haque and her son are able to apply for temporary visas if they wish to stay on after Sumaya leaves.\nDr Haque’s sister, brother and parents are all Australian citizens.\n“I still cannot believe how this could be happening. I cry every time I think she has to leave,” Dr Haque told the Sydney Morning Herald.\n“My children have been doing well in school, they have a lot of friends. I'm working in two practices, I have a lot of patients … I have been doing everything I can, hoping to have a good result.”\nRead more Sydney heatwave expected to break 120-year hot weather record “It's an impossible decision,” Dr Haque added. “I cannot imagine how I will live without my daughter … I don't actually know what I will do.”\nBrad Frankum, the president of the New South Wales branch of the Australian Medical Association said the Australian government’s decision was “disgraceful”.\n“It would take someone of immense callousness to split a family because one of the children is on the autism spectrum,” Professor Frankum said.\n“This family's human rights are being violated … The fact that an Australian resident of eight years, whose parents and siblings live here, can be faced with deportation due to illness is reprehensible.”\nWorld news in pictures 41 show all World news in pictures 1/41 23 February 2017 Zahra Lari of UAE at the Asian Winter Games - Ladies Short Program- Makomanai Indoor Skating Rink, Sapporo, Japan\nReuters\n2/41 23 February 2017 Zahra Lari of UAE in action at the Asian Winter Games - Ladies Short Program - Makomanai Indoor Skating Rink, Sapporo, Japan\nReuters\n3/41 23 February 2017 Pakistani security officials inspect the scene of a bomb blast in Lahore, Pakistan.
