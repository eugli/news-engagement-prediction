That promise wouldn't last through the entirety of a single episode of the show. \n\"He said he loves our show 'Shaqtin' a Fool,' but sometimes he thinks we put JaVale on there too much,\" Shaq noted during Inside the NBA. \nMoments later, the show aired this outrageous Doctor Strange parody featuring nothing but McGee goof-ups. It also featured Shaq playing a role in part of the film's trailer throughout the many Shaqtin' moments included: \nThings took off from there once McGee got word of the latest attack from Shaq. JaVale jumped on Twitter to give the Hall of Fame big man his two cents on the ordeal: \nShaq wasn't going to take that without a response: \nAt this point, the argument officially broke down to a full fledged Twitter war. It became the kind of thing you see between accounts that both still have their default egg avatars: \nBut Shaq had to get the last word on this, of course, playing on his favorite way to describe McGee: bum. Photoshop is a dangerous thing in the hands of a mad man: \nWho won this chapter in the battle between Shaq and JaVale? Let us know your thoughts on the crazy argument in the comments!
