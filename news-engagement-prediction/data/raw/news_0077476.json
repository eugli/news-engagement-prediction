Gampel Pavilion. (Photo: David Butler II, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nMost college basketball coaches know a cardinal rule: Don't tick off Mom. \nConsider Monique Holston-Greene to be one pretty ticked off mother after her son, South Florida player Troy Holston, was left at the airport following the Bulls' loss to Tulsa on Thursday night. \nHolston and fellow USF player Geno Thrope flew with the team from Tulsa to Houston, but fell asleep at the Houston Airport, missing the connecting flight. USF coaches failed to realize the two weren't on the plane until the flight was fully boarded. The players caught a flight home a few hours earlier, but Holston-Greene was unfazed. \n\"It's very disappointing, and it's a reflection of how terrible a program the men's basketball program is,\" the mother told the Tampa Bay Times . When U think it cant get any worse THEY LEAVE UR SON+1 BEHIND SLEEPING AT THE AIRPORT GATE! Is there any other way 2 say ur not important? â€” M. Holston Greene (@bballmama95) February 24, 2017 \n\"Terrible\" is an adequate way to describe the Bulls, who are 7-20 overall and dead last at 1-15 in the American Athletic Conference. And head coach Orlando Antigua was fired last month with the program under investigation by the NCAA for academic violations. \nUSF interim coach Murry Bartow issued a statement on Saturday morning to explain the matter. \n\"This unfortunate circumstance, for which I apologize, was recognized by our staff as the plane was leaving the gate and not in time to get the players on the commercial flight,\" Bartow said. \"We immediately began to make arrangements to get the players on the very next flight to Tampa, and were in communication with them as soon as was possible. Both players arrived safety home in Tampa later that afternoon at approximately 4:25 p.m., where a staff member met them at the airport. They are joining the rest of the team in a charity activity today.\" \nCOLLEGE BASKETBALL HIGHLIGHTS Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
