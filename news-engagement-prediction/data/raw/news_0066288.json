Comment on This Story Jae S. Lee/Staff Photographer Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott (4) throws the ball downfield over Green Bay Packers defensive end Letroy Guion (98) during the fourth quarter at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, Sunday, Jan. 15, 2017. The Dallas Cowboys lost 34-31. (Jae S. Lee/The Dallas Morning News) By SportsDayDFW.com Contact SportsDayDFW.com on Twitter: @SportsDayDFW \nDak Prescott has a favorite line: All 32 teams passed on me. They did it repeatedly, too, he likes to remind fans. \n\"Thank you to the 31 teams for passing up on me,\" he said in Houston during Super Bowl weekend, as he accepted rookie of the year honors. \n\"Actually 32 teams passed up on me three times,\" he said smiling. \"The Cowboys, they got lucky.\" \nOr was it Dak who got lucky with the season he had? \nHow did the Cowboys QB, who led Dallas to a 13-3 season and the top seed in the NFC as a rookie, fall to the fourth round of the draft? Was he really the 135 th best prospect in 2016? \nPro Football Focus analyzed the topic in one of its Draft Daily articles recently. \nIt's a \"fair question,\" writer Steve Palazzolo says. \"When evaluating his 2015 Mississippi State film compared to his 2016 Dallas tape, it's clear that Prescott made great strides with his footwork, pocket presence, decision-making and accuracy, so credit needs to go to both Prescott and the Cowboys' coaching staff.\" Dak Prescott thanks 32 teams for passing on him after winning Rookie of Year: 'The Cowboys, they got lucky' \nBut two aspects could've been caught, he says: Prescott's accuracy and his separation passes. \n\"While Prescott's overall numbers were solid, a deeper look showed a few areas in which he excelled,\" Palazzolo says. \"Prescott had the best accuracy (defined as a perfectly-thrown pass 'in-stride,' or one that hits the receiver between the numbers; passes that are 'catchable,' but off-target, do not count as accurate for this study) in the draft class on passes where his receivers had a step of separation. He also led the way on passes with a step of separation at both the 6-10-yard range and the 11-20-yard range.\" \nHow did the accuracy slip by? Prescott struggled at Mississippi State against \"tight\" coverage, Pro Football Focus found, ranking 16 th of 20 in his QB draft class. And because he passed in tight situations more frequently than his peers, the numbers reflected his struggles. \n\"Whether that was Prescott taking more chances, not having the receivers to separate, or not having the system that set up easier throws, the overall numbers were pushed down by his high percentage of throws into tight coverage,\" Palazzolo said.
