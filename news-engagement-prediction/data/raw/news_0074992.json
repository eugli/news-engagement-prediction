The Hollywood Reporter was on the grounds on the red carpet, backstage, in the audience and at the after parties to spot the most memorable moments that weren't seen on TV. \n1. Military Salute: Most actors walk on the side of the red carpet where they’ll do press interviews. Two notable names, however, unclipped the velvet ropes and made their way over the fan bleachers. Dwayne Johnson was the first actor to make a point of going over the fans, bee-lining for a group who were veterans wearing their military uniforms. He shook several hands before making his way inside. Denzel Washington also crossed over to the fan section to shake many hands — one woman was heard screaming “oh my god, he shook my hand.” Further down the carpet, he invited one man in a military uniform to meet him on the carpet for a personal handshake. \n2. White Helmets: Producer Joanna Natasegara, who made the short film White Helmets, told THR on the red carpet that it was “bittersweet” to be at the Oscars – her film’s cinematographer Khaled Khatib, who is himself a member of the Syria Civil Defense, wasn’t able to attend because of last-minute visa issues. “We’re really sad that the White Helmets can’t be here. He very much wanted to be here. We hope that we can tell their story,” she said. Director Orlando von Einsiedel was wearing a pin that said “Khaled Khatib” on it. Natasegara said that Khatib had given her a message to share if by chance they won. “They have something they want to share,” she said. 3. Standing Ovation : La La Land 's Damien Chazelle was the first person to lead the standing ovation for O.J. Made in America 's Best Documentary Feature Award. 4. Audience Shout-outs : As Best Actor in Supporting Role Award was being read, someone in the audience yelled, \"MICHAEL!\" in Mezzanine 1 for Nocturnal Animals ' nominee Michael Shannon — the award went to Moonlight 's Mahershala Ali. 5. Faye Dunaway's Grand Entrance : Entering the Dolby fashionable late, the legendary actress passed the front row, walking arm-in-arm with a guest and stopped to greet Isabelle Huppert.

Open Bar, but No Drinks Allowed Inside : While the lobby featured an A-List packed open bar, no drinks were allowed inside the theater, causing many in the audience to rush the bar for snacks and drinks during commercial breaks. Here's what you don't see on TV: Snacks, bar menu, so many empty glasses because people are DRINKING! #Oscars pic.twitter.com/JOe80Q5IEJ — Chris Gardner (@chrissgardner) February 27, 2017 7. Gasps! : The audience had its fair share of gasps during the broadcast with the biggest being of course the grand finale when La La Land was incorrectly named Best Picture, when in fact Moonlight won the prized award. Just before the Best Picture flub, giggles and gasps were also heard on Mezzanine 1 when Casey Affleck won for Best Actor but the camera panned to a noticeably disappointed Denzel Washington. 8. Stunned Audience Leaves Confused : After the Best Picture Award was announced, audience members including Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel started to leave right away during the speeches to beat traffic out of the theater but then missed out on the chaotic La La Land / Moonlight mix-up and were left confused. Some who worked on La La Land were overhead saying, \"That was the most embarrassing thing that has ever happened to the Academy.\" 9. Hollywood Ending : After the show ended, La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz and lead Ryan Gosling stayed back in a dazed shock. Gosling took pictures with fans as Horowitz stood in a dazed shock waiting around and was one of the last to leave. Lisa Taback, an awards campaigner for both Moonlight and La La Land was seen standing in the main lobby level with people around her looking genuinely shocked, scratching their heads wondering what just happened. Bonnie and Clyde strike again: People are so confused in here especially people who left early. #Oscars pic.twitter.com/PnOLCk7Unb — Chris Gardner (@chrissgardner) February 27, 2017 Here's what you don't see on TV: Snacks, bar menu, so many empty glasses because people are DRINKING! #Oscars pic.twitter.com/JOe80Q5IEJ — Chris Gardner (@chrissgardner) February 27, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T11:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T08:11:36.294+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
