But now, to top it all off, Domino’s has unveiled its own wedding registry. \nSo, WHO WANTS TO BE MY HUSBAND OR WIFE, POSSIBLY BEFORE THE WEEKEND? \nThat’s right, starting this week, soon-to-be-married couples can customize their own pizza registry on DominosWeddingRegistry.com , ensuring that they’ll get at least one wedding gift that they’ll actually enjoy. (Come on, how much do you really want that monogrammed salad spinner?) \n“We hear often from customers that Domino’s was a part of their big day, from proposals to after-hours meals at their wedding,” Jenny Fouracre, a Domino’s spokesperson, said in a statement. “We wanted to make it easier for people to ask for and receive something that they’ll really use.” \nThe Domino’s registry works exactly like other non-cheese-smothered registries do: Couples can sign up and select the pizza packages that they’re most interested in, then share a customized link on their social media profiles. Although the available packages range from a $25 Wedding Night Deal to a $100 Dancing With My Slice option, the names really don’t matter as much as the dollar amounts do; regardless of what each selection is called, the couple will receive an e-gift card in that amount, one that can be redeemed for food on Dominos.com. (Future wedding guests also have the option of a printable confirmation, in case you’d like to class it up by putting your $50 worth of cheesy bread inside a card). \n“Valentine’s Day is right around the corner, so we wanted to give recently engaged couples that are passionate about pizza the chance to register for something they both truly love as much as their partner,” Fouracre said. “Choosing wedding gifts can be a daunting process, especially if couples can’t agree on what to register for. Our registry aims to bring couples together over their shared love of pizza.” READ MORE: I Crashed the Wedding of an Elite Chinese Couple \nIt certainly will. If you’ve been debating whether to propose in the next week or so, maybe this will give you the push that you need. “So you’re telling me I get to marry the love of my life AND people will buy us pizza?” Domino’s asks itself on the Registry’s FAQ page. “That’s what we’re saying,” it replies. “What a world!” \nWhat a world, indeed. So, for real, who wants to do this thing?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:06:13.225+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
