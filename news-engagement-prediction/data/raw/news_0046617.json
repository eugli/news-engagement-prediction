UPS \nOn a sparsely populated patch of land outside Tampa, Florida, UPS on Monday showed off a first-of-its-kind test for the 109-year-old shipping company. \nUPS used a drone built into one of its iconic brown trucks to complete a delivery in Lithia, Florida, employing a truck and drone made by electric vehicle-maker Workhorse . \nThe drone flew out of the truck's retractable roof to make a drop-off along a preset autonomous route, while the driver headed elsewhere to make another shipment. The drone then rendezvoused with the truck down the road, docked back on the roof and recharged. \n\"This is a Kitty Hawk moment,\" Steve Burns, founder and CEO of Workhorse, said ahead of the test, referring to the Wright brothers' first historic flights in 1903. \"When people ask, 'When did drones begin entering the delivery space?' I think it'll be Monday. It should signal a huge change.\" \nThe test provides another small step toward making delivery drones a possibility for mainstream use, helping create faster and cheaper shipping. Additionally, as more people buy online, these drones could help alleviate strains in shipping infrastructure that have already cropped up, especially during the holidays. This is a Kitty Hawk moment. Steve Burns, founder and CEO of Workhorse \nThese drones could also save drivers gas and time by cutting down on stops, especially in rural areas, where drop-offs are often miles apart. Trimming just one mile per driver per day would save UPS up to $50 million a year, the company said. The environmental impact could also be significant, though the company hadn't yet crunched those numbers. \nOutside of controlled tests, the Federal Aviation Administration doesn't allow for most forms of delivery drones , so don't expect a package-toting flying object to buzz overhead anytime soon. Burns, though, argues that Workhorse's drones that operate with delivery trucks and drivers could roll out to the publicly as soon as this year. \nTo avoid tighter FAA regulations, some drone developers have gone overseas. For instance, Amazon in December started a small pilot program of delivery drones in rural England. Also, Chinese e-commerce company JD.com has been working on delivery drones in rural China since early last year. \nUPS, too, has worked on a handful of drones projects as it continues to learn how to use the devices. Last September, UPS made a mock delivery of medicine from Beverly, Mass. to an island three miles off the Atlantic coast. The company has also helped delivery medical supplies in Rwanda and uses drones to check inventory in its warehouses. \nIn Lithia, Florida, making deliveries. UPS \nStill, since delivery drone makers still need to tackle a hornet's nest of logistical problems, researcher Gartner expects delivery drones will amount to less than 1 percent of the commercial drones market three years from now. Instead, most commercial drones will be used for mapping and construction-site inspection, Gartner said. \nFollowing Monday's demonstration, UPS hasn't scheduled any additional tests with Workhorse's drones, though the company said it plans to keep testing different delivery scenarios. \n\"We're studying and understanding the opportunities that this will provide for us,\" Mark Wallace, UPS senior vice president of global engineering and sustainability, said. \"So we will continue to look toward the future.\" \nThere is concern that both drones and self-driving cars may put thousands of drivers out of work. Asked about that issue, Wallace said UPS' 66,000 delivery drivers are the trusted faces of the company and UPS doesn't expect drones will replace them. \n\"It really moves us into understanding how the technology can assist our service providers,\" he said of the tests. \"This will not replace our service providers.\" \nIt's Complicated : This is dating in the age of apps. Having fun yet? These stories get to the heart of the matter. \nDoes the Mac still matter? Apple execs tell why the MacBook Pro was over four years in the making, and why we should care.
