Eamonn and James Clarke 2 Helen Flanagan flashed her legs in a mini skirt as she arrived at the Coronation Street studios \nYummy mummy Helen wrapped up against the winter chill with a fluffy white fur coat and matched the snuggly theme with her striking silver stilettos – which had a pink pop pop on the end of each. \nHer hair was styled into loose brunette waves and she looked ready for a day playing Kevin Webster’s eldest daughter as she arrived on-set clutching a huge Starbucks take-away cup. \nThe mum-of-one raised a half-smile for photographers as she entered the Corrie hub at Salford Quays, in Manchester. Eamonn and James Clarke 2 The actress flashed a half-smile at the photographers waiting at the set \nShe made her return to the soap earlier this year after five years away and was immediately embroiled in a drugs storyline with on-screen sister Sophie (Brooke Vincent) and mate and rumoured love interest Adam Webster (Sam Robertson). \nHer character returned from America and drama immediately ensued. \nRosie’s explosive return from America to Wetherfield with Sophie saw her immediately embroiled in a drugs scandal with Adam. \nThe sisters bring the drugs back from the States, discovering them in a bag of sweets, and swiftly attempt to dispose of them. related stories Channel 4's The Royal House of Windsor explores past 100 years of the famous dynasty it's Actually happening Find out who’s returning for the mini-sequel to Love Actually – and when you can see it GROWING FAMILY Here's what we know about the latest additions to Madonna's brood - twins Stella and Esther WHO'S THAT GIRL?

Strictly star and Brookside, No Angels and Casualty actress on Who Do You Think You Are? \nDespite again dressing up to the Nines to resume her role, Helen, 26, has revealed she wanted her character to be less “catty” to make her comeback. \n“She’s turned a corner,” Helen explained. “Rosie has come back a lot more likeable now which won’t be boring to watch. I just think it’s easier to play. It feels more real to play it like that. \n“I didn’t really enjoy playing Rosie when I was younger in a nasty and catty way. I didn’t like it because it didn’t feel real to the situations if you know what I mean.” \nBut there are some benefits to being on the show – being glam for the 9-5 before she goes back to being too busy for makeup while on mum duty. \n“The best thing about playing Rosie is that she’s so glam. I love getting my make-up done and my hair extensions blow-dried every day, which you don’t get to do when you’re a mum.” \nShe added: “When I was in the show before, everyone was always jealous of my wardrobe and I definitely had the longest time in hair and make-up. \n“Rosie and Sophie do become window cleaners to help out their dad Kevin. The outfits are not very glam. But I am hoping it is short lived!” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T15:09:02.211+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
