Photo: Alex Ellinghausen \nBut the weathervane approach to politics Abbott had showed on climate change policy continued in government, weakening support among traditional Liberal Party voters, who at the last election looked to other parties, including the populist One Nation. \nIn opposition he made one of his infamous \"captain's calls\" and switched Coalition policy to support recognising local government in the Constitution. Senator Bernardi led calls for the position to be reversed and, at the very least, debated. \nOnce more he was having the same policy fight under the same leader. Was it 2009 or 2016? He couldn't tell \nHe continued campaigning on issues such as banning the burqa, opposing same-sex marriage and lower taxes, only to be mocked by Abbott and urged to pipe down by his formidable chief of staff Peta Credlin. \nIn the first weeks of his prime ministership Abbott said of Bernardi - in front of a group of backbench Coalition MPs - that the conservative senator should already be in cabinet and would be \"as soon as he stops talking about the things he is always talking about\". \n\"I have not the slightest recollection of the claimed conversation with colleagues and I don't leak, even to The Australian ,\" Abbott told Fairfax Media on Monday. \nAbbott went on to make a series of political and policy decisions Bernardi despaired over. He even crossed the floor. The internal fights grew tiring. He felt his only job was trying to save the party from itself. \nBut the final straw came late last year when he returned from secondment to the United Nations in New York. Fresh from watching Donald Trump's colossal disruption of the political establishment in the US, Bernardi found himself once more campaigning against his own government, this time railing against what looked like early moves to introduce a form of a market-based carbon price. \nOnce more he was having the same policy fight under the same leader. Was it 2009 or 2016? He couldn't tell. It confirmed for him that the party was spiralling and it didn't matter who was the leader. \nOn Tuesday he will walk into the Senate chamber as he has done thousands of times. But now, he will take a seat in unfamiliar territory on the crossbench. \nThe voters who abandoned the party in 2016 for One Nation, the Australian Liberty Alliance and others, will be offered a new choice and voice on the right. At worst, Bernardi will end up a lone protest vote in the Senate. But cabinet ministers worried about the recent speculation of a split fear this won't happen. \nInstead they despair that a Bernardi breakaway could have more impact than a leadership change by triggering a structural upheaval of the Liberal Party and Coalition. \nHas Australia's disrupter arrived?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T11:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T08:16:12.246+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
