Slot to Denver Broncos Newsletter Newsletter \nDue diligence is a trademark of John Elway , and his search for a franchise quarterback epitomizes that. \nAs Eric Edholm of Yahoo! Sports recently reminded , the Broncos have drafted four QBs over the last five seasons, from 2012-2016. \nThe New York Jets are the only other NFL team to match in that timespan. \nDenver's devoted a pick to a signal-caller in every year but 2014, when they made just six selections -- their smallest draft-day haul since 2007. \nAnd they've been more miss than hit. \n2012 -- Brock Osweiler (second round) : Osweiler held a clipboard for Peyton Manning prior to his big break in 2015. Osweiler pieced together a few wins for Denver before signing a massive deal with the Texans, where he predictably imploded. \n2013 -- Zac Dysert (seventh round) : Viewed as a project coming out of college, Dysert was the third-stringer behind Manning and Osweiler, bouncing from the active roster to the practice squad. He was cut in 2015, and has since landed with the Arizona Cardinals. \n2015 -- Trevor Siemian (seventh round) : Siemian was thisclose to pursuing a career in baseball when he got the call from the Broncos. To his credit, he more than earned the starting job last year, beating out Paxton Lynch and veteran Mark Sanchez . Siemian's the favorite to start next season, but questions remain about his long-term ceiling. \n2016 -- Paxton Lynch (first round): The presumed heir to Peyton's throne, Denver traded up to nab Lynch to be the future of the franchise. It didn't happen initially, but the organization has given him a vote of confidence, hiring QB gurus Mike McCoy and Bill Musgrave . The jury's obviously still out on the big-armed pocket-passer. \nWhat does this mean for 2017? That Elway is likely to pull the trigger once again. With 10 projected draft picks, he'll possess the ammo to burn a choice on another quarterback, if he so desires. \nSiemian and Lynch will battle it out this offseason, but with no third-stringer currently on the roster, and criticism surrounding his incumbents, Elway might not be able to help himself come April. \nFollow Zack Kelberman on Twitter: @Kelberman247 Author ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T03:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T05:04:32.872+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
