CHRISTEL YARDLEY/FAIRFAX NZ \nThe staff from Orewa Countdown have been praised for their kindness. \n\"When I arrived, the staff had her sitting on a chair with a bottle of water, and they had their arms around her, giving her a hug,\" Richardson says. \nREAD MORE * Age Concern helps isolated seniors \nRecognising the lost lady as somebody she visits through her volunteer work, Richardson drove her home. \nMeanwhile, Richardson's husband drove the lady's scooter home through the cold, which resulted in a month long cough. \nDuring Waitangi weekend, Orewa Countdown made a second kind gesture. \n\"And these are just the only two I know about,\" Richardson says. \nA disoriented woman entered the store, and told staff she didn't know where she was. Ad Feedback \nBeing the weekend, Age Concern was closed, but staff managed to find out the woman's home address. \nGoing one step further, a member of staff drove the woman home and made her a cup of tea. \nDiscovering a lack of food in the home, the staff member contacted Age Concern who organised a food parcel delivery. \nAge Concern Rodney CEO Catherine Smith says she is very impressed with Countdown's actions. \n\"We would like them to be recognised for such a fantastic service. The staff there is amazing,\" she says. \nSmith says Age Concern is always happy to assist, and people \"don't have to want anything - they can just ring for a chat or pop in for a cup of tea\". \n\"In this day and age, there are a lot of very lonely elderly people living in this area that do need a little bit of help or friendship. \n\"We want to put out there to younger people that you're all going to get older, so if you do see an older person struggling, go over and talk to them and see if you can help.\" \nAge Concern Rodney will celebrate 20 years of service in June, and is always on the lookout for volunteers. \nVisit ageconcern.org.nz/council/rodney for more, or phone 09 426 0916. - Rodney Times", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T05:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:24:41.172+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
