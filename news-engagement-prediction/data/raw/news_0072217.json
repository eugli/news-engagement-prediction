The northern entrance of the Parkway begins in Virginia at Milepost 0 near the southern terminus of Shenandoah National Park. From there the byway traverses 217 miles in Virginia along the picturesque ridge of the Blue Ridge Mountains and through the George Washington and Jefferson National Forests, before reaching the North Carolina border where it continues for another 252 miles. \nAlthough the roadway is generally open year round, many of the facilities and activities are available only seasonally, making the spring, summer and fall the best times of the year to plan your visit. Each season offers a unique experience along the Blue Ridge Parkway, from the flamboyant Catawba Rhododendron and other wildflower displays in the spring to camping, heritage festivals and more in the summer to nature's gorgeous symphony of color during the fall .
