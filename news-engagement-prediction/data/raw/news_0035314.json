He thinks the only teams with a shot at Romo are the Houston Texans and Arizona Cardinals, and Friday on \"The Herd\" he gave four reasons why. 1. Romo wants to play for an offensive-minded coach \nHe has one in Cowboys coach Jason Garrett, and could play for Houston's Bill O'Brien or Arizona's Bruce Arians. \n\"Denver now has a defensive coach. Jets have a defensive coach,\" Cowherd says. So you can rule those two out. USA TODAY Sports Bruce Kluckhohn 2. Romo wants a team with a championship-caliber defense \nThe Texans allowed the fewest yards (4,821) in the NFL last season; the Cardinals the second-fewest (4,883). Plus, Houston will have a healthy J.J. Watt back next season. \n\"Go ask Aaron Rodgers. Go ask Matt Ryan. You're not going to win a Super Bowl if your defense can't get stops,\" Cowherd says. 3. Houston and Arizona are close to home for Romo \nRomo and his family make their home in Dallas, so if he leaves the Cowboys, chances are he won't want to stray far. He also won't want to play his home games in cold-weather cities. So forget Chicago, New York and Denver. \n\"When you get old in life and you've had a few surgeries, the last thing you want is 34 degrees,\" Cowherd says. Bill Streicher USA TODAY Sports 4. Cards and Texans have offensive weapons \nLarry Fitzgerald, who led the league with 107 catches, announced he's coming back to Arizona. The Cardinals' Pro Bowl running back, David Johnson, had 80 catches â€” more than the Texans' two deep threats, DeAndre Hopkins (78) and Will Fuller (47). Houston also has a couple of prolific tight ends and a 1,000-yard rusher in Lamar Miller. \nAll in all, Cowherd thinks Houston is \"overwhelmingly\" the favorite to have Romo next season, despite the guaranteed $16 million Texans QB Brock Osweiler is due. Cowherd thinks the second-most likely option is that Romo stays in Dallas, with Arizona being the third and final option. \nEveryone else had better look elsewhere.
