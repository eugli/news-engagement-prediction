The pilot whales were found Friday at remote Farewell Spit at the tip of the South Island. It's an area that seems to confuse whales and has been the site of previous mass strandings.\nConservation workers and volunteers were hoping to refloat the surviving whales at high tide Friday morning.\nVolunteer rescue group Project Jonah said a total of 416 whales had stranded and most were dead when they were discovered.\nDepartment of Conservation spokesman Andrew Lamason told Radio New Zealand they were putting sheets and buckets of water on the surviving whales and trying to keep them calm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T04:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:30:39.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
