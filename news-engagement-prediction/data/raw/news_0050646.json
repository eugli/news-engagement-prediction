Please don’t tell Donald Trump that a gathering of penguins in Argentina outnumbered his inauguration.

Its population has been particularly impacted by oil spills in the past, with some 40,000 Magellanic penguins killed each year until the mid-1990s, according to Argentina’s Wildlife Conservation Society. This has improved over the last 20 years, however, with “less than one or two thousand oiled each year.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T06:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T02:20:38.733+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
