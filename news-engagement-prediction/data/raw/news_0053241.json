With the agreement of lawyers on both sides, Amon let the Brooklyn order against the ban expire on Tuesday with the understanding that it would be reinstated automatically if the Washington order against the January executive order is lifted. \nIn court papers last week, the government said it had identified 44 people from the seven countries subject to the ban who were found at U.S. airports to be inadmissible to the United States on Jan. 27 and 28. It said each of them voluntarily withdrew his or her application for admission into the United States and returned to a foreign destination.

It said 14 of them have since returned and been admitted to the United States. \nA Department of Justice lawyer and a government spokeswoman declined to comment Tuesday. \nLee Gelernt, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, said lawyers are \"pleased that the judge has recognized that we are entitled to the names.\" \nHe added: \"If they have the list of people, let's bring them back.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T09:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:56:47.173+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
