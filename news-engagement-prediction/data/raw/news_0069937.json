Han Solo – Smuggler. Scoundrel. Hero. A new Star Wars Story begins. https://t.co/6mjWKQcwwk pic.twitter.com/dWJwccpY33 \n— Star Wars (@starwars) February 21, 2017 \nYou’ll undoubtedly recognize a lot of faces here. (Did I mention the cast is stacked?) \nDonald Glover — known for “Atlanta,” “Community” and his rapper persona, Childish Gambino — will be playing the young version of Lando Calrissian , as we learned in October. \nIt looks like Lando’s already got his signature ‘stache at this point in his life. Giphy \n“ Game of Thrones ” fans will recognize Emilia Clarke (aka Daenerys Targaryen, Khaleesi, Mother of Dragons). Clarke’s role in “Star Wars” has not yet been revealed, and there’s no word yet on if dragons can exist in space. \nIf you caught “Hail, Caesar!” in theaters last summer you might remember the young Western film star, Hobie Doyle. Universal Pictures \nWell, his real name is Alden Ehrenreich, and now he’s Han Solo. It’s hard to imagine anyone other than Harrison Ford filling that iconic leather jacket, but Ehrenreich seems to be pulling it off just fine. \nWoody Harrelson will make his “Star Wars” debut as Garris Shrike, Han Solo’s father figure. Jury’s out on whether Han will be harder or easier to mentor than Katniss from “The Hunger Games.” Giphy \nReally intense television nerds and/or British people may also recognize Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the creator and star of two British series: “Fleabag” and “Crashing.” \nEarlier this month, Disney-Lucasfilm announced Waller-Bridge will take on the role of a CGI character in the new “Star Wars.” BBC3 \nAnd let’s not forget Joonas Suotamo, who appears in the cast photo in his full Chewbacca costume. (Or at least, we assume it’s Suotamo under that fur.) \nAlso pictured in the photo are directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, and not pictured is “Westworld” star Thandie Newton, whose role is not yet known. \nWith a cast like that, the new “Star Wars” is bound to be lit. Or should I say… lit-saber? \n(No. I shouldn’t say that. Apologies.) \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
