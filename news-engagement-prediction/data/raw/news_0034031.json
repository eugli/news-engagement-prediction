\nTHE WORRYING STATS PLAGUING COSTA \nIt’s not quite panic stations at Chelsea. \nAfter all, Antonio Conte’s side still holds a 10-point lead over Tottenham and Arsenal, with Liverpool and Manchester City 11 points back. \nBut there are a few problem areas Conte will want to attend to sooner rather than later. \nThe major one is the patchy form of marksman Diego Costa. \nThe striker failed to score in Chelsea’s 1-1 draw with Burnley. Chelsea's Diego Costa competes for the ball with Burnley's Ben Mee. Source: AP \nThat effort meant Costa has gone three straight Premier League games without scoring, while he’s scored just once in his past five away appearances. \nCrucially, Costa has failed to even register a shot on target in his past 195 minutes — though he’s not alone in that regard, with Chelsea failing to deliver a shot on target against Burnley after Pedro fired them ahead in the seventh minute. \nWhile Chelsea fans will back their striker in to find form, the draw to Burnley could well prove an important wake-up call going forward. \nTHE NUMBERS THAT JUSTIFY MARTIAL STARTING \nHe’s been somewhat out of favour with Jose Mourinho this season. \nBut the stats show when Anthony Martial plays, it’s good news for Manchester United. \nSince his debut for the club, Martial has been involved in more Premier League goals than any other United player. Anthony Martial celebrates scoring. Source: AP \nMartial has scored 14 goals and assisted eight, meaning he’s had more of an impact than Wayne Rooney (10 goals, 11 assists) and Zlatan Ibrahimovic (15 goals, four assists). 22- Anthony Martial has been involved in more PL goals for Man Utd than any other player since his debut (22 – 14 goals, 8 assists). Potent. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) February 11, 2017 \nWith his goal against Watford, Martial has scored seven times this season, despite completing 90 minutes just 10 times. \nHe’s been subbed either on or off 13 times so far, with Mourinho previously insisting he wants the winger to fight for his place. \nBut if this form continues, United fans could be seeing more of him. \nTHE ‘CEILING’ THAT STILL LIMITS SPURS \nThings were looking so good at Tottenham. \nThen they suffered a demolition job at the hands of Liverpool, with Sadio Mane putting on a clinic. \nNow one statistic has emerged that sums up Spurs’ issue in recent times. \nSince May 2015, Tottenham have only won one away game against a current top-eight Premier League side in all competitions. \nThat’s a huge issue to overcome if they want to move from a perennial top-four fringe team to a legitimate title contender.

Source: Getty Images \nThe Independent’s Miguel Delaney says manager Mauricio Pochettino looks to have hit a ceiling at White Hart Lane, with a great deal of work to be done to further change the mentality of the club. \n“I think there is an argument that Pochettino, in terms of the quality of the squad, is getting the best return in the entire Premier League,” he told Sky Sports. \n“The big hope with him is that he can defy these limitations, break barriers, and so far I think he has a little bit of a ceiling, and you can see that in his away games against big teams. \n“Since taking over in 2014, he has won just one of his 15 away games against top six clubs. \n“After his first game for Spurs, a 1-0 win at West Ham in 2014, Pochettino’s big statement was: ‘We have to change the entire mentality of the club’. \n“I think he’s started to do that, but has got some way to go.” \nHENRY’S PICK FOR PLAYER OF THE YEAR \nThierry Henry knows a bit about what it takes to win the PFA Player of the Year, having achieved that honour twice. \nHe’s picked a countryman as this year’s top player, saying Chelsea’s N’Golo Kante deserves the honour after a stunning first season at Stamford Bridge. N'Golo Kante controls the ball. Source: AFP \n“I was at the Chelsea training ground last week to see Eden Hazard and noticed Kante wandering back to the changing room,” Henry told The Sun. \n“So I went over to him and stood in front of him and I poked him in the chest. \n“I had to, just to check if he was real. \n“You are real, you are,’ I said, and he laughed.” \nKante’s tackling prowess, stamina and hardworking performances have helped elevate Chelsea into an all-conquering position this season. \nHenry said the midfielder deserved to be recognised for his superb season. \n“I see no reason why he shouldn’t be PFA Player of the Year at the end of the season,” he said. \n“It’s around now that the voting slips start to drop on the doormats of pros and there are loads of worthy candidates this time. \n“Usually your Kante-type player goes relatively unnoticed. \n“They are only missed when they’re not there. But Kante is so special, you do notice him.” \nOZIL THE LATEST TO FEEL WENGER’S WRATH \nArsenal may have secured a 2-0 win over Hull. \nBut that didn’t stop Arsene Wenger slamming one of his stars. \nAfter an exhilarating start to the year, Mesut Ozil has failed to score in the past two months — and it’s not gone unnoticed by Wenger. Report: Gunners top Hull \n“Maybe it’s time for Mesut to score a goal again,” Wenger said. \n“He needs a big moment to find his confidence again. \n“At the moment he misses chances that don’t look unfeasible for him to score.” \n“I completely agree that was not technically confident and that is a problem for us because we always think he can deliver something special.” \nTHE LATEST DAMNING LEICESTER FAILURE \nThings have gone oh-so-wrong for the reigning Premier League champions. \nBut they’re even worse than they appear. Report: Swans beat Foxes 1:26 \nWith just one point to their name and a horrendous goal difference of -19, the Foxes sit below Leyton Orient, Coventry City, Aston Villa, Bournemouth and Crystal Palace. \nThe top performers? \nMansfield Town, who have racked up 19 points in seven game with a goal difference of 14, Exeter City, Doncaster Rovers, Norwich City, Fleetwood Town and Huddersfield Town.
