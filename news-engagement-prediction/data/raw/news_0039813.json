Recommendations include: Handguns should be illegal unless possessed by dealers, maintained in gun clubs or ranges, or are job-related Fines for cannabis use be increased to a figure \"that reflects the deleterious effects\" the drug can have Penalties for supplying guns to children be \"significantly\" increased Police \"accord appropriate priority\" to investigate allegations of illegal gun possession Such allegations are assumed to be true until shown otherwise \nDuring the coronial inquest into Mr McPherson's death, the coroner's court heard Humbles came to the attention of police multiple times before the fatal shooting. \nThe court heard that just two weeks before the fatal shooting, Humbles had been arrested at his parents' house over a theft and disturbance. \nHe was bailed to a home on Railway Terrace in Warradale, which had been reported over potential drug activity, underage drinking and providing shelter to a missing teenager. \nThe court heard Humbles had a history of drug problems and the inquest heard of a tip-off to police about him selling drugs at Brighton High School and potentially carrying a weapon. \nSeveral SA police officers gave evidence during the hearing about how Humbles came to be in possession of a gun, and the coroner heard that police had contact with the convicted killer at least four times before the shooting. Teen's death could have been 'prevented' \nDeputy coroner Anthony Schapel recommended an overhaul of police practices in relation to drug and gun possession. Photo: Lewis McPherson died after he was shot on New Year's Eve, 2012. \n\"There were a number of opportunities to have prevented Lewis McPherson's death,\" he said in his 95 pages of findings. \n\"I am not certain that all of them if taken singly would have prevented his death, but when examined collectively there seems to be little doubt about it.\" \nThe deputy coroner said Humbles should have been arrested and investigated for drug possession and that should have led to his firearm being located. \n\"In the court's opinion, there is no question but that the firearm that Liam Humbles maintained in his possession during the course of 2012 could have and should have been located by police at some point in time prior to 31 December 2012,\" the finding stated. \n\"Prior to the shooting, Humbles had irresponsibly caused the weapon to discharge on two occasions of which the court is aware, one time in a public park and the other inside a house. \n\"At that time of his existence, Humbles was a complicated individual being paranoid, erratic and angry. \n\"Even his peers and his own father shared that view, believing that his character was the product of illicit drug consumption. \n\"There is little doubt that this was the case. Regardless, this naturally provided neither excuse for nor mitigation of his conduct. \n\"It is difficult to think of an individual who could be less trusted with a firearm and ammunition.\" \nThe inquest heard Humbles had been given five drug diversions, meaning he was not arrested or prosecuted for drug possession but was required to attend meetings about it. \nThe deputy coroner found that police investigations into information they had received about Humbles was \"flawed and inadequate\". \n'The issuing of a drug diversion to Humbles on this occasion was inappropriate and not in accordance with SAPOL General Order - Drug Diversion having regard to the suspicion that he was trafficking in cannabis.\" Bail conditions 'extraordinary' for a child \nHumbles was arrested in 2012 for damaging property at his parents' house, where he had been kicked out of home due to his problematic drug-induced behaviour. \nIt was a condition of his bail that he not attend at his parents' address or communicate with any of his family members. \nMr Schapel expressed concern at that process and the lack of any other action. \n\"When one momentarily suspends one's world-weariness and stands back from this scenario with detached reflection, what an extraordinary thing it is for a child, even of 17 years of age, to be banned by the processes of the law from having anything to do with the members of his immediate family,\" he said. \n\"You would think that for the sake of the child and for the sake of the public interest in general, this circumstance would necessarily trigger a considered and robust protective response on society's part. \n\"In my view, a bail condition or intervention order that prevents a child from associating with the child's natural family should require the closest scrutiny.\" Child protection authorities should have been informed \nHe also said Humbles should have been brought to the attention of child protection authorities. \n\"I have identified within the body of these findings the reasons why he could have been viewed as a child at risk,\" Mr Schapel said. \n\"This fact should have triggered a mandatory intervention pursuant to section 19 of the Children's Act 1993. \n\"If that had occurred, it is highly probable that Lewis McPherson's life could have been saved. \n\"The fact that in 2012 Liam Humbles was approaching his 18th birthday should have made no difference as to whether or not the provisions of the Children's Protection Act 1993 could have been invoked.\" \nThe deputy coroner made 17 recommendations including that the drug diversion process relating to children be \"re-evaluated in its entirety\". \nHe also recommended that SA Police \"accord appropriate priority to the investigation of allegations of unlawful possession of firearms, especially handguns\" and that those investigations be overseen by a senior police officer. \nA police spokesperson said the force would \"now thoroughly review the findings and recommendations\". \n\"It would therefore be inappropriate for police to comment on any of the recommendations until they have been given due consideration.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T07:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T08:30:19.448+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
