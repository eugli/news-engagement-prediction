Jose Luis Villegas The Sacramento Bee i \nBy Joe Davidson \nSearing commentary on the Kings trade that shipped talented if tempestuous All-Star DeMarcus Cousins to New Orleans left ripple effects at the franchise’s flagship radio station. \nDamien Barling, one of three co-hosts on KHTK 1140’s afternoon talk show “The Lo-Down,” was kept off the air by station management Wednesday for critical comments directed at Kings general manager Vlade Divac on Monday. \nIn an apparent sign of solidarity, Barling’s radio partners Jason Ross and Ken Rudolph briefly went on the air at noon, explained the situation and then went silent. The station then aired a nationally-syndicated talk show. \nSources with knowledge of the situation but unauthorized to speak on the matter confirmed that Barling was not suspended or fined by the station. It’s unknown if Barling will return Thursday. \nKHTK sports director Kevin Sherrets did not immediately return messages from The Bee. \nAfter Divac’s press conference at Golden 1 Center, where he explained his decision to trade the three-time All-Star and admitted that there had been a better offer on the table before sending Cousins and Omri Casspi to the New Orleans Pelicans on Sunday night in exchange for Buddy Hield, Tyreke Evans, Langston Galloway and two future draft picks, Barling went on the air and called Divac a “moron.” \n“That was embarrassing. That was absolutely embarrassing,” Barling said following Divac’s comments. \nRoss asked: “In what way?” \n“In every single way imaginable,” Barling continued. “That dude is not fit to be the general manager of a basketball team. This is real life. \n“You just heard a general manager say publicly at a press conference, ‘We had a better deal two days ago.’ You moron! You can’t say that!” \nBarling added a moment later: “Are you serious? I don’t even know what to say. If you’re a Kings fan, you should absolutely be embarrassed by that. That was awful. That was absolutely awful. You cannot do that. You can’t do that. Awful. That’s awful dude. Absolutely incredible” \nBarling, Ross and Rudolph could not be immediately reached for comment. \nKings spokesman Chris Clark said that the Kings were not involved the matter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:04:42.838+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
