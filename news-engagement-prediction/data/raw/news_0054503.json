But from the second episode on, the show refused to let the story of a tragedy become a tragedy itself. \nJason fought his way back into the world and found a new path for himself. After leaving Texas in season 3, Street returned briefly in season 5, which is when fans learned that he’d become a husband, a father, and a successful sports agent. And for Scott Porter, that was the greatest goodbye he could’ve imagined. \n“In my mind, Jason won,” Scott Porter says during EW’s Binge podcast . “Everybody in that town is so worried about winning football games but when it really comes down to it, he won the biggest prize of all: He grew up. He got out. He has a wife that he loves, and he’s got kids, and he’s got a great job, and he succeeded when the deck was so stacked against him and that is only a testament to his fortitude. And of course he had support around him, but he had to fight through everything and had to overcome so much. I think it was the perfect ending for Jason.” \nTo hear more from Porter – as well as costars Derek Phillips, Connie Britton, and more – on the making of Friday Night Lights , you can listen to the new episode of EW’s BINGE of Friday Night Lights above, where hosts Samantha Highfill and Darren Franich analyze season 5’s biggest moments.
