So it's perhaps not surprising that Mariah Carey decided to hit the gym in a jaw-dropping ensemble on Thursday. \nThe 46 year-old, who is never backwards in coming forwards, showed off her generous assets as she squeezed herself into a pair of fishnet stockings and a high-rise leotard for a rather unconventional work-out. \nProudly displaying her backside as she climbed some exercise stairs, she even teetered along in a pair of 5\" stiletto heels - in, of course, bright white patent leather. \nDespite being better suited to the dancefloor, rather than the treadmill, she seemed delighted with her attention-grabbing style and posed up a storm for social media. Mariah Carey raises eyebrows - and temperatures - in the gym (Photo: Instagram) \nPosting the first snap on Instagram, she captioned the cheeky shot 'Climb every mountain' and, naturally, it generated a huge response, with more than 59,000 'likes' in just five hours. \nHilariously, one fan responded: \"Been working out wrong\", while another added: \"She is so outrageous I love her\". \nLapping up the attention, she then shared a front-facing snap which saw her lifting weights while pushing her ample chest out. 'We must we must ... ;)' she teased, garnering a further 500,000 views. The 46 year-old certainly showed James Packer what he's missing! (Photo: Instagram) The chart-topper was more than happy to strut her stuff (Photo: Instagram) \nA third upload showed her 'running amok', but this attracted less-flattering comments. \nOne disgruntled fan wrote: I love Mariah, I went to see her last concert and am a true fan, but this is really ridiculous - it's all that is happening with her right now and is not making sense anymore.\" \nNot that she's ever really bothered by what other people think. \nThe chart-topper is in an eyebrow-raising relationship with dancer and choreographer Bryan Tanaka - who is several years her junior. The pair started dating immediately after she split from billionaire James Packer.
