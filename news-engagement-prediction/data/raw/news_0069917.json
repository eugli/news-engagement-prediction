Haunting pictures show the forgotten starving children of South Sudan \nBefore the Charles Thompson Mission Centre , in Birkenhead, Merseyside, was a homeless shelter it was a centre for poor children. \nAs a girl from a poor family, Peggy benefitted from the centre and has dedicated years to repaying the kindess offered to her. \nShe said: ‘When I was a young girl it was the only place I could come for a warm and a bun. I was one of the poor children it helped and I was so grateful to it. \n‘I came with my mum first – I went to her meetings and then, when I realised there were children’s activities, I went to those. Peggy has been volunteering for eight decades (Picture: Liverpool Echo) \n‘It was the only place in Birkenhead that gave out anything – today there is so much help and food given out, some people don’t know they’re born. \n‘Thousands upon thousands of people have got reason to be thankful for this place.’ Hunters who accidentally shot one another blamed illegal immigrants \nWhen she was just 16, Peggy decided she wanted to help those in need – and later, despite having her own family and her own job, she continued to find the time to volunteer. \nShe said: ‘I’ve enjoyed every minute of it. I’m here two days every week and I love it. I used to come here every day and I wish I still could – but while the spirit is willing my body is weak. \n‘I’d be broken-hearted if I ever had to stop coming here and helping out because it’s been my life.’ \nPeggy, who worked as a waitress at the old Robbs department store in Birkenhead, even met her late husband Ted at the mission. The couple had one son, David, who died 10 years ago, aged 55. \nAs the years creep by, Peggy admits that it’s not as easy getting herself to the homeless centre. Peggy was helped by the centre as a girl (Picture: Liverpool Echo) \nShe revealed: ‘The other Friday, I’d got the get up but I didn’t have the go! Bernie (Frost, the manager) rang me to see if I was OK – it’s nice that people worry and I suppose I am a fixture here. \nIn the last 12 months, Peggy’s had two knee replacements and two cataract procedures. Obese men last 1 minute and 30 seconds longer in bed – here’s why \nBut, health permitting she likes to make it to volunteer. She jokes: ‘My doctor wants me to get that telegram from the Queen!’ \nMission manager Bernie Frost says: ‘Peggy likes to work in the background and doesn’t realise that she makes an enormous contribution to the Mission. \n‘She is faithful and steadfast – and she’s not to be messed with.This Mission, a drop-in centre for the homeless and needy which you could say was the original food bank, has been operating here for 125 years and Peggy has been such a big part of its history.’ The Charles Thompson Mission in Liverpool (Picture: ctmission) \nFellow volunteer Amy Stanley, said: ‘We are a charity for the homeless and over the years Peggy has served meals to thousands of people and changed the lives of so many. \n‘She inspires us every single day and still has no plans to retire.’ How to help ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T15:15:51.365+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
