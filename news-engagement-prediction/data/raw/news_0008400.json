The lion dancers were peeling a pomelo and oranges to present to Najib Abdul Razak. This symbolises honour as the Chinese tradition goes. \nThe whole truth is now out! \nNow the whole nation awakens to measure the shameless lies and diabolic spins of some leaders and so called people’s representatives. \nNot only are such individuals and party representatives bankrupt to the marrow, they have confirmed what we in BN have unequivocally maintained. \nAll the lies, spins and exploitative tactics of those opposed to our current leadership must be shunned and shamed by Malaysians who uphold honour, integrity and truth. \nTo these Rasputins bent on destroying our nation’s pride and prestige, I have this to say: \nWhat peace, progress and prosperity that are continuously being built by BN cannot be broken by bankrupt, rotten Rasputins. \nThis lion dance episode says it all, loud and clear. \nM KAYVEAS is president, myPPP. \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T06:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:29:18.522+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
