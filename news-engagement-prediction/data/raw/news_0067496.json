However, GDE spokesperson Oupa Bodibe on Friday said the department had requested the school to withdraw it. \n\"As the department we support the need to comply with laws of the country, but caution that we need to be sympathetic and deal with it with empathy,\" said Bodibe. \n\"So the school has been asked to withdraw the last statement, where it was threatening to send the children to the police station, but rather to tell parents that if they don't comply they must keep their children at home.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:04:27.691+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
