These peanut butter powder recipes are delicious — and super-easy Share Tumble   \nYou've probably seen powdered peanut butter on grocery store shelves — or maybe in an Instagram post by your favorite fitness blogger — and wondered, \"How the hell does that taste good? And how can it even be healthy?\" \nBut, honestly, we're here to tell you that despite its frankenfood-like appearance, powdered peanut butter does taste pretty damn good — and it does have some nutritional value. It's an easy way to add some zing to otherwise average recipes. \nLe'ts break it down, shall we? Image: SheKnows \nRoasted peanuts, sugar and salt. This product is vegan and vegetarian-friendly, and dairy and gluten-free. The look \nIt resembles peanut flour. The texture is very, very fine and very smooth. The taste \nThe flavor of powdered peanut butter is milder than real peanut butter. You still get that great peanut flavor but with a lighter flavor, though it is still very satisfying and very good. How to use \nPer the directions on the package, you mix 2 tablespoons of powdered peanut butter with 1 tablespoon of liquid. I tried water, and I also tried mixing it with almond milk. Both were delicious. Once prepared this looks just like real peanut butter, and it can be used just as regular peanut butter would be used. \nSome of the ways I used it: A spread for sliced apples Spread on toast Stuffed inside fresh bread with fresh strawberry jam A big spoonful on homemade waffles Added to oatmeal Nutritional value \nThere are two things that I really love about powdered peanut butter. First, it blends easily into other recipes and even smoothies. Second, its nutritional value. Check out this side by side comparison of my favorite peanut butter versus powdered peanut butter \nReal peanut butter: Calories per serving: 190 calories Grams of sugar per serving: 8 grams Grams of fat per serving: 14 grams Grams of protein per serving: 6 grams \nPowdered peanut butter: Calories per serving: 45 calories Grams of sugar per serving: 1 gram Grams of fat per serving: 1.5 grams Grams of protein per serving: 5 grams \nThe powdered version of peanut butter has a significant difference in nutritional value compared with real peanut butter. I will still enjoy eating both regular peanut butter and the powdered version, but if you are watching fat, calories, sugar, etc., this is a wonderful substitute to have on hand.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:28:48.206+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
