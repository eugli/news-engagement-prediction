Emanuele Tramacere for Calciomercato suggested recently that the Premier League side are on the lookout for a new goalkeeper, with manager Pep Guardiola said to be an admirer of Handanovic. However, the man himself has insisted he's happy at Inter. \"When I was under contract with Udinese Inter used to win every trophy,\" he said to Gazzetta dello Sport (h/t Calciomercato ). \"Many things have changed but I'm happy to be here and I want to stay even if we won't be playing the Champions League next season.\" Since his arrival at the San Siro, Handanovic has cemented his status as one of the best goalkeepers in Serie A. Here's a look at what he would potentially bring to the Etihad Stadium: Indeed, although Inter aren't the force they once were in the upper reaches of Serie A, in Handanovic, they have a tremendous goalkeeper. The 32-year-old is authoritative in his command of the area, quick off his line and capable of producing some stunning stops. Additionally, Handanovic has developed a reputation for being superb at keeping out penalty kicks, too. ESPN FC's David Amoyal thinks the Inter man is often overlooked due to other quality goalkeepers in Serie A: David Amoyal @DavidAmoyal Said it before but worth a reminder, between Buffon and Donnarumma I think Handanovic gets overlooked- he continues to be decisive for Inter 2/19/2017, 1:27:53 PM Having spent big to land Claudio Bravo in the summer, it'll be fascinating to see whether Guardiola does make a move for another goalkeeper at the end of the season. The Chile international has struggled in the Premier League, his replacement, Willy Caballero, has yet to impress and Joe Hart is on loan at Torino . It's unlikely to be Handanovic, though, as he seems set on helping Inter back into the UEFA Champions League. The team are in fourth place in Serie A as it stands, six points back on third place Napoli . Kylian Mbappe Rumours YANN COATSALIOU/Getty Images According to James Robson of the Manchester Evening News , Manchester City boss Guardiola was keen to secure Monaco starlet Kylian Mbappe ahead of the current Premier League season. His piece named the players that Guardiola targeted in the summer—such as Athletic Bilbao defender Aymeric Laporte, Arsenal full-back Hector Bellerin and Juventus centre-back Leonardo Bonucci. Mbappe was said to also be on the club's hitlist. \"Mbappe—dubbed the new Thierry Henry—was on his radar, with sources in France claiming City were willing to pay as much as £33 million for the 18-year-old,\" Robson's report continued. Here's why there's so much excitement surrounding the player: The Etihad Stadium crowd got a good look at the forward on Tuesday night, as City beat Monaco 5-3 in a thrilling UEFA Champions League encounter. Mbappe was on the scoresheet in the first period, and as these numbers from Squawka Football show, he's making regular contributions in the final third: Squawka Football @Squawka Kylian Mbappé has been directly involved in a goal every 71 minutes across all competitions this season: 12 goals 5 assists 18-years-old. https://t.co/s667jDVLfc 2/21/2017, 11:10:07 PM Robson suggested that Guardiola is keen to lower the average age of his squad, and acquisitions like Leroy Sane, John Stones and Gabriel Jesus will aid that process. Mbappe would add another refreshing dimension to the City team if he were to join one day. However, staying at Monaco this season has helped fast-track his development, and manager Leonardo Jardim is utilising a thrilling style that brings the best out of Monaco's attacking stars. With that in mind, another year in Ligue 1 might be the sensible choice for this rising star. Like the new article format? !
