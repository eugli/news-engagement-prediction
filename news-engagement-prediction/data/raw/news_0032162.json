By capitalizing on the tepid reveal of Microsoft's Xbox One, Sony's PS4 leapfrogged its rival in hype and sales, and the console has topped sales charts ever since. \nBut let's be frank: you can't play hype, and Sony's launch lineup was weak, at best. Thankfully, much has changed since then. That's not to say that there weren't games worth playing on PS4 until now. Bloodborne was exactly the type of exclusive the PS4 needed, and this Lovecraftian action/horror game is still one of the best games the PS4 has to offer. \nLast year saw the release of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain , which offered excellent stealth action, despite being a disappointing conclusion to the MGS story. Alien Isolation was another fantastic multiplatform title worth grabbing on the PS4, especially if you were on the hunt for a good horror game. \nSony's catalog of titles has expanded this past year to include some truly excellent exclusive games, as well as some multiplayer titles you do not want to miss. Uncharted 4 arrived in late spring to deliver the dazzling cinematic experience PlayStation fans have come to expect from the series. Doom is an amazing first-person shooter on any platform, but it is one PlayStation 4 players need to own if they don't already. \nFor the full rundown of our top 10 favorite PS4 games, check out the gallery.
