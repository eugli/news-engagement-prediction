Though the only daughter of the late music icon Michael Jackson plays in a band with off-and-on boyfriend Michael Snoddy , she doesn’t intend to make a career out of music. \n“I write music for myself,” the CR Fashion Book Issue 10 cover girl explains in the magazine. “I use it as a way to get stuff out.
