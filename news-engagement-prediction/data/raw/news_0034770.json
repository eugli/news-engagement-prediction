Those campuses include eight high schools â Sunset, Spruce, Skyline, Kimball, South Oak Cliff, North Dallas, Conrad and W.T. White â and one middle school, Tasby.

The districtâs student attendance rate was 85 percent Thursday, down from 95 percent on Wednesday. \nWhen students are absent, school districts can lose state money. And, of course, the students lose time in the classroom. \nâI would prefer our students to be in class and take every opportunity to learn,â Resendez said. âBut if they chose to take a stand in that manner, thatâs their prerogative.â \nResendezâs resolution would be largely symbolic. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that states canât deny children a free public education based on their immigration status.

Staff Photographer \nStill, Resendez said, heâs heard from students, parents and teachers in DISD and beyond that many kids worry about their parents or other loved ones being deported. President Donald Trump has announced orders and policies aimed at stricter enforcement of immigration laws. \nAbout 70 percent of DISDâs 158,000 students are Hispanic. The district does not track the percentage of students who are unauthorized immigrants. \nSeveral other large districts, including Houston ISD and San Antonio ISD , have passed similar resolutions. Austin ISD is considering one as well. \nIn California, the stateâs education chief recently urged school districts there to declare themselves safe havens, according to news reports. Hundreds of students protest, dozens of businesses close in Dallas for 'A Day Without Immigrants' strike \nSchool districts arenât the only ones declaring theyâre havens. Dallas County passed a resolution this month that calls for local law enforcement to end ânonessential collaborations\" with federal immigration officials. \nBoth Trump and Gov. Greg Abbott have called for crackdowns on so-called sanctuary cities and counties â a loosely defined term thatâs become explosive for some politicians. They can be places that shelter unauthorized immigrants by not cooperating with federal immigration authorities. But others argue that federal immigration authorities are largely those charged with enforcing immigration laws. Texas Senate approves measure to cut funds for sanctuary cities \nThe approach that the proposed Dallas ISD resolution lays out âis not only appropriate but probably mandatoryâ under federal law, said Thomas Saenz, president and general counsel for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, a nonprofit civil rights group. \nWhen it comes to public schools, Saenz said, âOur interpretation has always been you must provide a safe haven.â \nStaff writers Corbett Smith and Claire Ballor contributed to this report.
