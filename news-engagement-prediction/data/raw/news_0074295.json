'They'd been making a few really interesting shapes and I was kind of just hoping they would make something really striking or obvious. Dominic Reardon (pictured), took the stunning photograph 'I didn't expect it to be a dolphin though. It's the first time I've physically witnessed a murmuration like that and I was mesmerised. 'They gather above a place called Carr Bank so I waited for them a couple of miles away in Sandside. 'I actually saw them flying around when I was driving. The group starts out really small and then lots of little groups join up together. It's amazing.' Dominic, who first picked up a camera three years ago, spotted the starlings on February 15 with his pal Kieran Fallows. He described how the birds followed the light at the sun set at around 5.30pm. Dominic said: 'It was all about getting something to stick. They way they move around makes it quite difficult to get a precise shape. 'It was just this massive black silhouette shifting around in the sky but I was really chuffed when I looked back and saw how well the dolphin picture came out. 'A few other people have said it looks like a sperm whale or a swordfish - someone even said it's a penguin on its front - but for me it's a dolphin. 'They're doing it every night at the moment and Cumbria is one of the best places to see starling murmurations. 'I spent about an hour that night capturing them. I'm really chuffed with it.' Mystery of the murmuration: Thousands of birds thought to flock together for safety and warmth A murmuration sees thousands of starlings swooping and diving in unison. Each bird mimics the movement of its neighbour, which ripples out to the whole flock. Little is known about why these occur, although it has been suggested that the displays help the birds by confusing predators. Grouping is also thought to give the birds safety in numbers to protect them from predators like peregrine falcons. Murmurations also allow starlings to keep warm and learn from each other about good feeding areas. The best time to see a murmuration is just before dusk in the evening. Sadly the starling population has fallen by over 80% in recent years due to habitat loss. They are now one of the most critically endangered birds in the U.K. Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T19:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T15:47:26.645+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
