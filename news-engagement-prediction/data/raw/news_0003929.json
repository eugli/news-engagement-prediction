Comment on This Story Staff Photographer Dallas Cowboys tight end Jason Witten (82) argues with back judge Steve Freeman during the first half of an NFC divisional round playoff against the Green Bay Packers game at AT&T Stadium on Sunday, Jan. 15, 2017, in Arlington. (Smiley N. Pool/The Dallas Morning News) By Brandon George , Staff Writer Contact Brandon George on Twitter: @DMN_George \nHOUSTON -- Jason Witten says it's a \"fair question.\" \nThe Dallas Cowboys tight end just finished his 14 th season in the NFL and keeps getting asked how much longer he will play. \nWitten, who will turn 35 in May, will be entering the final year of his contract in 2017. He's still playing at a high level and rarely comes off the field. \nWitten, making his rounds on radio row at Super Bowl LI on Friday, said he plans to play in 2017 but doesn't expect to sign a contract extension this offseason. \nWill he play multiple more years? \n\"You know, I don't know that it would be fair to say that,\" Witten said. \"I think at this point you just go into it and look at it one year at a time. I wouldn't rule it out, but I don't think I'm going to be making an announcement that this is it either. I know how much it takes to put into it, so you don't know what you're going to feel like.\" Jason Witten: Tony Romo wasn't saying goodbye when season ended, 'I could see him coming back' \n\"I know what I'm capable of doing, the level I expect myself to play, because when I look back on it and will continue to evaluate this season, I really felt that I was able to do that this year. For me, I love playing with this group. I love my role within it and certainly my expectation is to play at that high level. I don't know how many years that reaches, but I still love doing it and the opportunity that I have.\" \nLast week at the Senior Bowl in Mobile, Ala., Cowboys executive vice president Stephen Jones was asked about Witten's future with the team beyond 2017. \n\"Obviously Witten is one of the all-time greats and we'll just figure it out to his satisfaction,\" Jones said. \"Obviously he's under contract and fired up about next year and we'll see what the day brings there in terms of what he'd like to do and what we're all comfortable with.\" \nWitten's body isn't telling him \"No\" yet, that's for sure. He's missed only one game in his career, and that came way back in his rookie season of 2003. \n\"I feel good. I really do,\" Witten said. \"I know people say that, and I don't know how many years that equals, but my role within this offense is unique. We're a run-first football team and we have [Cole] Beasley and Dez [Bryant], a lot of different playmakers, so my role is within that group. I like this team. I do. I'm excited to get back out there and start this process all over again and lead this group. Although this was a tough loss, you've got to go back and stoke that fire. You don't just pick up where you left off. You have to go prove it again, and that's something I'm anxious to get started.\" This Topic is Missing Your Voice.
