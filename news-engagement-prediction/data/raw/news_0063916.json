But some things remain the same. Be prepared for tough door policies with knowledge of the DJ and basic German skills offering better chance at entry. Peak times are 1:00 til 3:00. Arrive outside of these times for easier access to top Berlin clubs. \nAnd while there are clubs for every persona, for Berlin think less trendy and more gritty. It is impossible to list them all, but here we present the crème de la crème : The best clubs in Berlin.

Berghain \nAn institution in Berlin’s nightlife scene and by many celebrated as one of the world’s best clubs, Berghain isn't for the faint at heart. Its throbbing techno beats and hedonistic vibe draws thousands of locals every weekend to party until sun comes up again. \nCelebs like to party here too - Lady Gaga was spotted - although the club is anything but glamorous. Located in a former power plant, Berghain has a minimalist design with lots of concrete and steel. Very Berlin. \nThe club’s selective door policy (and infamous tattooed doorman Sven Marquardt ) is legendary - be prepared for hour plus waits - and there are strict rules about no photos and filming inside the club. What happens in Berghain, stays in Berghain. \nAddress: Am Wriezener Bahnhof 10243 Berlin Metro: S-Bahn Ostbahnhof Open: Weekend 23:00 - open end More » \ncontinue reading below our video Long-Haul Flight Survival Tips 2. Week End \nFor a hip vibe with sweeping views of Berlin, hit the Weekend Club . It is located on the upper floors of an old office building on Alexanderplatz. With the Bar and furniture at the center, there are panoramic windows looking out on Berlin's cityscape. Make sure to take the elevator all the way up to watch the sunrise. \nIn the summer months, a rooftop deck has you dining on BBQ with Berlin's skyscrapers. The roof garden opens at 19:00. \nAddress: Alexanderstr.7, 10178 Berlin Open: Weekend 23:00 - open end More » water-gate.de 3. Watergate \nWatergate Club is located in the heart of Kreuzberg. It has two levels, and the lower dance floor, called waterfloor, is spectacular: It has a wide floor to ceiling glass front that overlooks the river Spree and an illuminated bridge – it feels like you are dancing on water. On warm summer nights, enjoy the breeze on the outside deck over the water. \nAddress: Falckenstein Strasse 49, 10997 Berlin Metro: U1 Schlesisches Tor Open: Thu-Sat 23:00 - open end More » Patrik Axelsson https://www.flickr.com/photos/patrikaxelsson/2712659635/in/photolist-58H6cH-5mkayK-5mkaZH-5mkaMe-eDm5DH-5mpqNC-5mpq7j-5mpquf-5mpqCY-eDsd7f-ahZBCY-bhddM6-89Pjbh-dTkjeS-dTmqtR-ahZBAq-dptKH3-dTmrrr-dTkoEQ-wR9xnd-ahWNDv-wR9yKo-xNNH2K-uPQj9b-qxU9UK-dTeEvV-dTk5Y1-dTka8q-dTmoHD-8moFwu-dTeEjt-dTevYD-dTmoPn-o7WnRA-89L5hp-89Pjxm-dTkcpY-dTs2SE-dTmtCi-dTs1So-np9KF-dTk9aw-dTmuCx-dTmpkc-9pzB5V-iwqMQZ-czhcdL-dTs8rf-dTeECK-dTkin7 4. Tresor \nTresor (meaning \"vault\" or \"safe\") is a legendary institution. It was the city's first techno club and introduced electronic music to a Germany no longer separated by the wall in the early 90's. \nAfter closing in 2004, Tresor celebrated its resurrection in an Kraftwerk (old power plant) in Kreuzberg in 2007. Ever since, Tresor has been throbbing with hard and loud electro, acid and industrial music. In 2016, tresor celebrated its 25th anniversary. \nAddress: Köpenicker Strasse 70, 10179 Berlin Mitte Metro: U8 Heinrich-Heine-Strasse Open: Wed, Thu-Sat midnight - open end More » thornet_ https://www.flickr.com/photos/thornet/13996852717/in/photolist-neCutP-a6dzaD-a6gqSC-a6fzsQ-a6dzfa-njRwER-a6dz1F-cvuYhE-a6cJbR-a6dyWa-a6gqqE-cvuXCu-nczHMD-a6cHVt-NwRLN-57hjSg-NwRLU-67Lb6n-nir9AS-bZRd5J-aw16dg-9ohVp-ff3Db-ff3Da-86T1BB-rS4VVw-41jJb-8pdY4X-6NNMjD-cBBaNN-aw14gD-ff3Df-cvuWBE-ff3Dd-cs4MRU-dFPrpd-9ohQ7-ff3Di-7RcHkU-bvzNhk-7R9rCH-6ewjWL-6gnozQ-4caLwL-7vQYWZ-d5453S-4DM6Cj 5. White Trash Fast Food \nWhite Trash is many things – a restaurant with great hamburgers, a tattoo parlor and a kitschy club. The interior of White Trash is a mix of tacky Asian and American memorabilia. \nMoved from its original location on Alte Schönhauser Allee, it now sits next to Club der Visionaere (a great pre and post club hangout), among the industrial warehouses of the Treptow Flea Market and before Badeschiff . Bands sweat out everything from Country and Rock, to Punk, and Indie. You'll find many American expats with an English-speaking staff. \nAddress: Am Flutgraben 2, 12435 Berlin Metro: S-Bahn Treptower Park Open: daily, 18:00 - open end More » Jakob Botter 6. Golden Gate \nNo one is going to complain about the noise here as it is housed beneath the S-Bahn's brick railway arches. Small and a bit grimy without windows alluding to the outside world, people come here to dance. The door policy is more relaxed and many Berghain rejects find their way to a good time here. \nIf you need a break from the intensity, there is an outdoor garden space where you can take a breather before jumping right back into the fray. \nAddress: Dircksenstrasse 77, 10179Berlin Metro: S-Bahn Jannowitzbrücke", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:14:50.108+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
