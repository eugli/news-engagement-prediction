Sticking to the show's plot, the two old friends, Mitch and Phil, keep breaking their loop and have to be reset by park staff. \nHell ? \nBilly Crystal and Daniel Stern reunited to bring their iconic City Slickers characters to life one more time in a hilarious parody of HBO's Westworld for Funny or Die. \nSticking to the show's plot, the two old friends, Mitch and Phil, keep breaking their loop and have to be reset by park staff. \nThe four-minute video also features cameos from the Westworld cast to kick things up a notch, including Luke Hemsworth and Ptolemy Slocum. \nJust as the hosts do in the HBO show, Mitch begins to malfunction, breaking his loop and Phil follows his lead because of course that's what Phil would do. \nEach loop ends with Mitch having enough of Phil and a gun is pulled, much like in Westworld . \nCity Slickers came out in 1991 and a sequel, The Legend of Curly's Gold , was released in 1994.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T04:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:37:13.802+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
