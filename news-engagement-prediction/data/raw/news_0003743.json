Hall of Fame quarterback and commentator Kurt Warner asked who the most famous person in their cell phone was. Then it got weird. \nBlank replied with country star Kenny Chesney. However, he then shaded his counterpart Kraft, answering for him with “ Donald Trump .” \nKraft is a supporter and friend of Trump . Given Blank is a heavy Democratic donor , perhaps the dig could’ve been expected. Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank spoke out against Donald Trump yesterday: https://t.co/2Us7FKqSZF — SB Nation NFL (@SBNationNFL) January 31, 2017 \nBlank spoke out against Trump, expressing particular concerns with the president’s Holocaust Remembrance Day statement. Blank, who is Jewish, took issue with Trump neglecting to mention the roughly 6 million Jews senselessly murdered in World War II. \n“I’m troubled by anything directionally in our country that separates people,” said Blank, who has brought his entire organization for this week’s Super Bowl festivities. “America started without any of us, other than Native American Indians. This country was built on inclusion and diversity, on celebration of those differences, supporting those differences, and everybody being the very best they can be in their own way. I’m opposed to anything that takes away from that... That’s what makes America great.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T04:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:18:23.970+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
