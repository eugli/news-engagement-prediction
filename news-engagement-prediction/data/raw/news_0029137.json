Shamsudeen said Shamsul had tried to reach the children who were in an upstairs bedroom at the back of the house, but the flames blocked him. \n“He had no choice but to jump out the balcony, injuring himself,” Mohamed Sabri said when met at the scene Tuesday. \nShamsul’s 80-year-old mother Wong Ah Yin, who was in the bedroom near the kitchen downstairs, was pulled to safety by his wife, Lam Chooi Lai, 37, who had seen the flames when returning home. \nMohamed Sabri said firefighters had to battle their way through the blaze after gaining access to the second floor via a neighbour's balcony. \n“We tried to go in to save them, but the fire was too strong. \n“By the time we got through, the three were found collapsed at the doorway of one of the bedrooms,” he said. \nHe said there were no burns on them but they were not breathing. \nThe three victims were rushed to Hospital Sungai Buloh but were later pronounced dead. \nMohamad Sabri said they most likely died of smoke inhalation. \nSelangor Fire and Rescue Department fire forensics assistant director Zakaria Muhd said the cause of the fire was still under investigation but it was clear that it started in the living room. \n“At the moment it looks like an electrical fire but we have to do a full investigation first,” he said. \nZakaria said the incident was similar to the fire in Subang Jaya last week that claimed the lives of four members of a family. \nRelated story:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T15:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T11:12:57.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
