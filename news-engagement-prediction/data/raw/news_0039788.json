Sitting in the drive-thru lane, too close to the building for comfort, was a Ford F150 pouring smoke from the cab which was engulfed in flames. \nWithout hesitation, Womack bypassed customers waiting in the drive-thru line, mounted the curb, and used his patrol car to push the fire-on-wheels away from the building, saving it from catching flame as well, and endangering occupants. It was just in the nick of time, too. As Womack got the truck away from the building, the back window of the truck shattered, allowing flames to pour through. \n“My adrenaline was going a little bit. But in the video, I’ve watched it a couple of times, I’m breathing pretty heavily. Well, that’s because the windows were down and I didn’t have the train of thought to roll the windows up during it,” Officer Womack told Fox4 News . “It was just a God-send that I was here at that particular time.” \nWatch the video below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T02:42:05.345+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
