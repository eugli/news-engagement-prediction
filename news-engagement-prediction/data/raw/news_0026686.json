On Monday, Mexican-American designer Raul Solis had models walk the runway in underwear that read, “Fuck your wall” and “No Ban No Wall.” Jason Kempin via Getty Images \nThe resistance: so hot right now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T22:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T17:51:22.286+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
