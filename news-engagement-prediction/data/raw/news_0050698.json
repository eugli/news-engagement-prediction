GRANT BALDWIN The Olde Mecklenburg Brewery is expanding its footprint with a Cornelius location. The Charlotte brewery recently purchased a 24-acre wooded site on Zion Avenue for about $3 million. That site houses a 51,000-square-foot facility that previously had been used for manufacturing. John Marrino is founder of The Olde Mecklenburg Brewery. GRANT BALDWIN Plans call for Olde Mecklenburg to invest an additional $7 million this year to transform the existing building into a German-style brauhaus and biergarten. OMB also will expand its brewing and wholesale operations to supply that market. It anticipates adding 100 new jobs. Further details were not immediately available. “We have a long-term commitment to the Charlotte region and we believe that this site will allow more Charlotteans to experience OMB and our beers first hand,” Olde Mecklenburg founder John Marrino says. The goal is to open around 2018, spokeswoman Jocelyn Ruark says. But, that growth — and investment — hinges on whether the N.C. General Assembly adopts legislation to raise the 25,000-barrel self-distribution limit . The current law requires breweries to sign with an outside distributor after they reach that amount. Olde Mecklenburg has said it will cap production to avoid crossing over that threshold. It brewed more than 21,000 barrels in 2016. Marrino and other breweries and businesses in the state have launched an initiative called Craft Freedom, which is focused on raising awareness and raising that limit. “The current law protects wholesalers and foreign beer from free and open homegrown competition. It’s truly un-American and unfair,” Marrino says. He notes that a change to the law will allow OMB and other locally grown brewers to continue to invest in the community, increase jobs and have a larger economic impact. OMB says that if the cap remains, its plans will be scaled back to just the brauhaus and biergarten. “We hope we can make the Cornelius site everything it can and should be,” Marrino says.
