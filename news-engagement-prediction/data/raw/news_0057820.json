Wag tularan!!! (Mapsa extortionists, more of you will be next!!! Don’t be like them!!!)” ADVERTISEMENT \nOliveros, 38, died on the spot with gunshot wounds in the head and back, according to the case investigator, SPO1 Arnel Noriega. \nFive .45-caliber bullet casings were found at the crime scene. \nThe victim left behind a wife and two children aged 15 and 6, the Inquirer learned. \nNoriega said a witness had given a statement saying that about an hour before the shooting he saw Oliveros having an altercation with a female driver. \nFlorentino Rendon, an investigator at Mapsa, said Oliveros had never had an extortion complaint filed against him during his seven-year stint as traffic constable. \nRendon said it was possible that the gunmen were targeting one of the victim’s colleagues. He mentioned two other Mapsa members who were set to be transferred from the Osmeña-Valderama post after getting into trouble in the area. \nThese two Mapsa members had briefly left Oliveros alone to buy food when shooting took place, Rendon said. /atm", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:47:54.324+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
