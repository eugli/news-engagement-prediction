Submitted by farhan on Mon, 27/02/2017 - 8:30am \nI was browsing the Orchard Gateway website on 26 Feb (Sun), and chanced upon this fashion advert (\"Against The Norm\") of a young man in a flowery shirt upside-down, with his head against the floor. This is featured on the front page, apparently to promote Orchard Gateway's men's fashion offerings at \"Men's Zone @L4\". http://www.orchardgateway.sg/menszone/index.php Advertisement \nIs it pure coincidence or Orchard Gateway's marketing department trying to be funny with this tongue-in-cheek message? (\"step into a new world\"?!?) \nI find this ad very distasteful and appalling, as 17-year old Jonathan Chow recently died (24 Feb) from falling from the Level 4 'ledge' at the link-bridge between Orchard Gateway and Orchard Central. \nConcerned friends, shoppers and Singaporeans may raise their concerns to Orchard Gateway@6513 4633. \nParkour Lee ASS Contributer Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
