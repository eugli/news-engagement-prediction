Thank you both for joining us this morning and, Jackie, let me begin with you. We saw your tweet in Cecilia's tweet. Have you heard back from the president. I have not heard back that I know of but I'm hoping soon. If you get that meeting, what do you want to tell him? I guess I just want to enlighten him on what my sister, I've seen her go through every single day in school and people just like her, what they deal with, the discrimination, it's terrible and I guess I kind of just want him to relook at that. And, Juliet, what does the president need to know about what you go through every day. Basically that being at a high school where the policies on the bathroom are unclear, I as Jackie has said, I kind of live it every day going through discrimination, I've had things thrown at me. I've had people say pretty horrible things and the unsafe environment is just very unhealthy, so I feel like Donald Trump needs to know that being in such an unsafe environment won't do any good for not only the transgenders and the lgbt community but as well as everyone as a whole. Did your life change when the guidelines came out from the president, Juliet? So far luckily nothing is very much changed for me. Of course, when I heard about it I was very disappointed and I realized that we would need to take action in order to enlighten the administration on everything. But has your school overall been protective of you? Overall, yes. And, Jackie, of course, you did sing at the inaugural. The president was a big fan. Would you sing again? Most definitely, because the reason why I did sing for the inauguration was not politics, it was for the honor and the privilege to perform for my country and that will stay the same, I think. Okay, let's hope you hear from the president, thank you both very much. Both: Thank you. Let's get more on this from Dan Abrams right here. What's the practical impact of what the president has done? Instead of viewing this as a civil rights issue, a fundamental question of discrimination where the schools don't have any choice it's now going to go back to them to be able to decide what they want to do but keep in mind there's already a nationwide temporary injunction in place which effectively means this directive from president trump isn't being executed right now anyway. So when it comes to what happens today, is there a difference today, no. Is there going to be a difference in the future, yes. And eventually this whole issue of transgender bathroom rights almost certain to be decided by the supreme court. It's already in front of the supreme court. There's a case, the Gavin Grimm case which is supposed to be a big case. The problem the lower courts were deciding that case based on the president Obama directive. That became an important point, so if you don't have that directive anymore and you don't have the administration defending it in that way you've got a fundamentally different case and so the question now is is the supreme court going to say, wait a sec, if this if the administration's position we're going to send it back to the lower courts and not hear this case that we were supposed to decide till next month but I think in the end it will eventually end up there in some way, shape or form to answer the fundamental question, is this a title 9 violation? Is this a civil rights case? If you have different rulings coming from different circuits in the country you're probably going to end up in the supreme court. Dan Abrams, thanks very much.
