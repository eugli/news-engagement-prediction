In December, he survived a deadly vigilante-style shooting at a house party in one of Philippines major cities. Seven people, most of them teenagers, were killed. He suffered a bullet in his abdomen.\nThe young man lives in fear, afraid that the shooters may want to finish the job. “There were rumours that there was a survivor and it was me – the ones who did this would think there’s a witness,” he said.\nImmediately after the slaughter, he sought sanctuary from the only institution that would take him in.\nThe church has helped him find temporary work, which he says he enjoys, but he worries about being exposed to strangers. Fireworks frighten him and he suffers from nightmares and insomnia.\n“These are the people who have been targeted by the cops,” says Billena, the spokesman for Rise Up, a multi-faith movement founded to resist the drug war. “We offer the church to them on the condition that they should be serious about changing [their lives].”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Father Gilbert Billena at a church in Quezon City, Manila Photograph: Poppy McPherson \nDespite mounting casualties, the senior leadership of the church in the majority-Catholic Philippines was initially silent on the lethal campaign. Many within its ranks were initially proponents.\nBut faced with growing numbers of dead, there is hope that attitudes are changing. Sermons written by the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines and read out at Sunday services all over the country earlier this month labeled the anti-drug crusade a “reign of terror”.\nThe numbers of churches actually taking action against the campaign are still fairly few. Within Billena’s diocese, there are only five or six, he says, despite an instruction from Antonio Tobias, Bishop of Novaliches to give help to those in need.\n“He told me personally: ‘Give them sanctuary. Open the doors of the churches,’” Billena says. “Many also are not doing perhaps because they are afraid. They do not know how to do it.”\nThe concept of providing sanctuary has a long history within Christian tradition. During the early years of the religion, fugitives were legally entitled to shelter in churches if they could get one body part inside the building or simply clasp the rings on the doors. Though the official right to sanctuary was phased out by the end of the 1600s, the practice has continued informally.\nIt has far more recent precedent in the Philippines during the Marcos era when churches harboured journalists, senators and other intellectuals declared enemies of the state by the regime. One of the most famous is the Baclaran, or the Redemptorist Church, which runs several safe houses. \n“Us Redemptorists, we’ve been in more difficult situations before,” says Brother Jun Santiago.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest One 18-year-old in hiding witnessed a massacre in his neighbourhood. Photograph: Poppy McPherson \nThe Baclaran’s outspoken response to the drug war has made it a target for criticism. In a speech last year, Duterte singled out an exhibition put on by the church that displayed the dead bodies of victims.\nAlthough the drug war has slowed since Duterte announced a temporary pause in late January, the killings continue. The president has called in the army to takeover from the police.\nAnd Duterte’s allies still pursue his critics, with police arresting a senator on Friday who has been the most high-profile voice of dissent. Senator Leila de Lima insisted she was innocent of the drug trafficking charges that could see her jailed for life, saying they were put forward to silence her.\n“Last month, we had two visitors straight from Malacañang, from the palace,” says Santiago, referring to the residence and workplace of the president. “They were our friends but they gave us some indicators that ‘you are under watch’.”\nThe local police are aware of the presence of drug addicts protected by the church.\nNevertheless, the church continues to offer sanctuary and helps raise funds for families who cannot afford to bury their dead.\n“If we were intimidated, that would be the end of the role of the church,” says Santiago, adding that at least 20 people he knows have been given sanctuary, some of them moved from place to place to ensure their safety.\nRecently, he helped a woman whose sister was selling shabu, or methamphetamines, after losing her job at a beauty salon.\nDuterte's drug war in the Philippines is out of control, he needs to be stopped | Robert Muggah Read more \nMasked men came into the house and dragged the woman away, telling her family to go to the local police station if they wanted answers. They later found her body in a nearby alley.\nHer sister got a text from a number she believes belongs to a local police officer saying she would be next. “We have eyes that watch over you,” it read.\nThe 32-year-old and her three small children tried to shelter with neighbours but they were too scared to take her in. Eventually she found her way to the Baclaran, which found them somewhere to stay.\nShe says that after her sister’s burial, she decided to kick her own habit. “I thought: ‘I’m also going to bury my vice,’” she says. “I want to regain myself and retaliate later on.”\n“This whole thing – the war on drugs – it is only the small time people being targeted,” she says. “Normally we look at the tree and cut the roots, and end things, but this time it’s the other way around – cut the branches and the roots still remain.”\nAdditional reporting by Rica Concepcion. \nPhilippines Asia Pacific Rodrigo Duterte Catholicism Christianity Religion features Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:59:00.681+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
