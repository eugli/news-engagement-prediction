Long Story \nWinning the lottery would be an unquestionably good thing. Could you blow it all through gross financial mismanagement? Sure, and that would suck, but getting your hands on more money than most people will ever see is an incredibly rare (and unequivocally good) opportunity. \nJust don't tell that to Jane Park, who four years ago became Britain's youngest-ever Euromillions lottery winner at 17 by winning a cool £1 million ($1.249 million). Now, at age 21, Jane is aiming to sue the bosses behind Euromillions. Her reasoning? The windfall \"ruined\" her life, and she argues that no one that young should be able to win that much money. \nThe whole article in the Mirror is worth reading, but there's some fantastic cognitive dissonance going on here. \n“I thought it would make it ten times better but it’s made it ten times worse. \n\"I wish I had no money most days. I say to myself, ‘My life would be so much easier if I hadn’t won.’ \n“People look at me and think, ‘I wish I had her lifestyle, I wish I had her money.’ But they don’t realise the extent of my stress. \n“I have material things but apart from that my life is empty. What is my purpose in life?” \nThis is astonishing, mostly because in the very first paragraph of the story, it's revealed that she owns \"two properties.\" Most of her discontent stems from the usual sources: flashy material purchases that provide limited happiness , bad relationships with men whom she showers with gifts, etc. But the worst part? Her friends aren't also rich, which is hard. \n“It’s scary how ­different my life is from my friends’. When they say they’re stressed about money they mean their wages are s**t. \n“There’s no one in the same boat as me, no-one who really understands. I feel like I’m a 40-year-old.” \nCamelot, the company that runs Euromillions, goes into great detail about the amount of support they offer winners. They're assigned dedicated advisors to help them manage their sudden wealth for as long as they'd like, and in Jane's case they even introduced her to someone who won at a similar age thinking it might help. But the problem, it seems, is that all these financial types wanted to bore her with lame financial terminology. \n“I was stuck in front of a financial adviser who was using words like ­investment bonds. I had no clue what they meant.” \nNow: I'm not saying I necessarily would have been a more savvy investor at 17, in fact I surely wouldn't have been. But if someone told me \"right, ok, this is what you should do,\" my response (probably) wouldn't have been \"I don't understand the words you're using, so I'm just not doing that.\" \nThere is, however, probably some merit to the notion that 16-year-olds probably shouldn't be trusted with huge sums of money . But Camelot had a suitably pithy answer to that as well. \n“Anyone over the age of 16 can play the lottery, and therefore win a prize,” they said in a statement. “Camelot doesn’t set the age limit to play – this was agreed at the launch of the National Lottery back in 1994 and so any questions about the legal age to play would be a matter for Parliament.” \nEven if you don't have much sympathy for Jane (and you shouldn't; she's not broke and, again, owns two properties), you can at least appreciate the newfound self-awareness, right? \nBut has she ever thought of just getting rid of her winnings to relieve herself of the burden? \n“What?” Jane laughs incredulously. “Nah.” \nOh.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:43:39.426+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
