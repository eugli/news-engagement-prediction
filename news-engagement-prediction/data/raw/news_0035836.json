These cosmic particles can hit electronic devices on Earth, which can cause components to burn out and cause malfunctions. Cosmic particles come from cosmic rays from outside our solar system. They crash into the Earth's atmosphere creating a range of particles, including protons, electrons, X-rays and gamma-rays that can penetrate aircraft. These cosmic particles constantly hit Earth, and can cause bits of information in electronics to change. When a machine malfunctions in this way, it's called a Single Event Upset (SEU). These changes can be enough to cause a computer to freeze and reboot, affecting the outcome of computerized elections. They can also cause other problems such as causing planes to suddenly come out of autopilot mode. Professor Bharat Bhuva, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Vanderbilt University, gave a talk about this problem at the annual meeting for the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Boston. During his presentation, he said: 'This is a really big problem, but it is mostly invisible to the public. 'The semiconductor manufacturers are very concerned about this problem because it is getting more serious as the size of the transistors in computer chips shrink and the power and capacity of our digital systems increase.' 'In addition, microelectronic circuits are everywhere and our society is becoming increasingly dependent on them.' In this time-lapse photo, stars appear to rotate above the Middle Drum facility of the Telescope Array, a $25 million cosmic ray observatory that sprawls across the desert west of Delta, Utah. Physicists from the University of of Utah and the University of Tokyo and elsewhere report the observatory has detected a hot spot in the northern sky emitting a disproportionate number of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays, which are the most energetic particles in the universe Professor Bhuva said that an SEU is could happen for more than one reason, and it's only possible to say it was caused by a tiny particle if all other possible reasons have been excluded.
