Oviedo girls soccer team runs during preseason practice at Shane Kelly Park on Monday, Oct. 24th, 2016. (Charles King/Orlando Sentinel) J.C. Carnahan altered its soccer format in January. Difficulty in finding a host venue led to combining the 10 boys and girls state finals into a four-day span.\nFriday’s winners advance to state final matches at Spec Martin Stadium in DeLand next week. \nThe Lions reached the 5A championship game the past two years and have won three state titles since 2011. They enter the state semis having blanked 16 opponents while allowing just six goals all season. \n“We’ve had a lot of expectations that have been put on our shoulders,” Oviedo senior Erin Mikalsen said while looking back on the past four years. \n“Everybody seems to play their hardest against us, so the hard work for us happens at practice first and then the games are about having a good mindset,” Mikalsen said. \nThe Lions will have their work cut out for them Friday against an opponent that’s been equally impressive. Newsome owns a 2-1 win over Bolles and has given up only 15 goals on the year. \nTo prepare, Oviedo altered its field dimensions during training this week to mirror the close quarters at Newsome. \n“Whatever field you play on, you just hope that you’re the better team that night,” Waisanen said. “You never want field conditions or field size to dictate a final four game, but we just have to show up and play the best we can.” Caption Public defender arrested for DUI \nAn Orange County public defender pulled over for a DUI last week asked the trooper not to take him to jail because he was a good person, video shows. \nAn Orange County public defender pulled over for a DUI last week asked the trooper not to take him to jail because he was a good person, video shows.
