Baby girl absolutely loves bath time UP NEXT \nJust like her Dad, adorable six-month-old Alexis Bartlett from Sydney's Northern Beaches has so much hair that her parents were in disbelief at her birth - even after seeing signs in an ULTRASOUND. Alexis has a full head of hair at just 6 months old! Photo: Caters \n\"At first we were both shocked, it wasn't just her scalp, she had a hairy forehead and hair all over her back-not to mention her hairy butt,\" Alexis's Dad, Adrian Bartlett, 32, said. \n\"The ultrasound even showed up that she was going to be hairy so that was a clear indication she was going to be taking after me in those stakes. I was born with hair and I've even put together two photos of us as hairy babies to show people where she's inherited it from. \nThe irony of Alexis having plentiful hair could not be greater as Mum, Nicola Bartlett from London, also 32, cuts hair for a living. it's a good thing her mum is a hairdresser. Photo: Caters \nIn the Sydney sunshine, Alexis has been able to flaunt her beautiful brown hair when out with her family- earning her hordes of admirers. Still only six-months-old, Alexis now has shoulder length hair. \nRELATED: Meet these rare biracial twins \nAdrian, who runs a fire extinguisher firm, said: \"It's funny that Nicola, being a hairdresser gave birth to such a hairy baby. Our family love her to bits although her great-grandfather hates all the hair ties and hair clips but he will get over it. Alexis' hair even showed up on her ultrasound. Photo: Caters \n\"Strangers are always stopping us wherever we go to the extent that we couldn't imagine having a bald baby. Shopping always takes a little longer and dinners out always get interrupted by everyone sitting nearby. \n\"I personally love her hair, I think it adds so much character. Everyone said that it would fall out but six months on and it's only getting longer in fact she might be due a haircut soon, I guess Nicola will have to check her diary for appointments.\" Baby's gender revealed by father's hair color UP NEXT ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T07:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T03:49:19.414+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
