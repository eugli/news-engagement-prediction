Ramanathan said he did not ask “Penang Indians to give priority to the Nattukotai Chettiar Temple’s silver chariot or that the Nagarathar Chettiars are the descendants of Lord Thandayuthapani” as posted in Facebook.\n“This is mischievous. I don’t have a Facebook account.\n“The police told me that they will get back to me in three days,” he said, adding he lodged the report at the North-East district police station on Sunday.\nGeorge Town OCPD Asst Comm Mior Faridalathrash Wahid said they have sought the help of the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission to identify the person who posted the message.\nRamanathan, a former Penang Hindu Endowment Board commissioner, said some quarters might have targeted him as they believed he was the one who went to Tamil Nadu in India to get a letter from the Arupadai Veedu Trust stating that the golden chariot’s procession should be confined to the temple grounds.\n“I went to Chennai for business last week. It has nothing to do with the trust. Why are they attacking me? he asked.\nRamanathan said there was another posting in Facebook urging Tamil people to boycott his restaurant here and to gather at the (Nattukotai Chettiar) temple to seek an explanation from him.\nMeanwhile, Penang Tamil Schools Special Committee chairman Datuk Dr K. Anbalakan rapped a small group of Indians who had sought support from a ‘dubious” organisation in Chennai (capital of Tamil Nadu) to hoodwink Penang Hindus.\nReferring to the United Hindu Religious Council which has issued statements against the golden chariot, he said the organisation – Arupadai Veedu Trust was nothing more than a building committee.\n“What authority does the committee have to decide the agamic principles of Hinduism?” he asked in a WhatsApp post which has gone viral.\nDr Anbalakan said those opposing the golden chariot have no right to brand Penang Hindu Endowment Board chairman Dr P. Ramasamy as an atheist and to argue that Dr Ramasamy was not qualified to lead the golden chariot procession.\nRecently, the United Hindu Religious Council, a little-known entity, claimed that according to what was stated in a letter by the trust dated Jan 21, street processions for golden chariots involving all Lord Murugan temples should be prohibited.\nCouncil spokesman M.V. Mathiyalagan claimed that the practice was based on Hindu Vedas (scriptures), religious teachings, beliefs and norms.\nThe rival chariot processions have become a political issue with many DAP Indian leaders posting their support for the golden chariot in the social media while many from the MIC are rooting for the silver chariot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:12:28.139+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
