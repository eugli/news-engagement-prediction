Heibei China Fortune (managed by Manuel Pellegrini) agree deal to sign Juventus Brazilian midfielder Hernanes for £8.5m- Kaveh Solhekol (@SkyKaveh) February 6, 2017 \nHeibei China Fortune have agreed a £8.5 million fee with Juventus to sign the Brazilian on a lucrative deal. \nThe CSL side - managed by former Manchester City and Real Madrid boss Manuel Pellegrini - have tabled a two-year deal worth a reported £7.75 million per year. \nAfter being removed from Juve's Champions League squad, his move away from Turin was edging closer with fellow Serie A side Genoa keeping tabs on him. \nNot to mention interest from back home with Sao Paulo, though the lucrative contract from Asia has proved too hard to turn down - how many times have we said that?! \nThe 31-year-old joined from fierce rivals Inter Milan in 2015 but following a lack of playing time Hernanes is set to link up with a host of compatriots in the Far East revolution.
