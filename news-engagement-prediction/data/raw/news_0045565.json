But note the product is not actual chalkboard paint: It captures the classic matte finish, but you shouldn’t draw on it. The creamy formula developed with KILZ is easily applied to wood, metal, concrete and more properly primed surfaces, and dries with an Ultra Matte Finish to provide the lived-in look that the HGTV star has made famous. brightcove-video:5166622940001 \nAvailable in 44 tintable hues, Gaines’ latest offerings come in classic colors like “Shiplap” and “Magnolia Green” — both nods to her other business ventures. Fans will also flock to those shades named after her four children. For daughters Ella, 9, and Emmie, 6, she has colors called “Ella Rose” and “Emmie’s Room.” Sons Drake, 11, and Duke, 8, have namesake hues in “Sir Drake” and “Duke Gray.” \nThis isn’t the first time that Gaines has incorporated her family into the Magnolia Home collection. When she created her original 25 paint colors in April 2016, she told PEOPLE that her children were just as much a part of the creative process as she was. \nRELATED: Chip and Joanna Gaines’ Magnolia House Just Booked Up 6 Months in 5 Minutes \n“I let them pick the paint color they love, they pick the name, and so they feel like they’re working with mom and not that mom is working and they’re over in the corner,” Gaines said. “We figure out ways to make them feel like they’re super-involved so that it seems a little more holistic.” \nHer newest line will be available beginning in late spring 2017 on MagnoliaMarket.com , and will be shipped directly to DIYers’ homes. Select colors will also be available at the Gaineses’ Magnolia Market compound in Waco.
