The problem is thatonly 15,000 people paid the co-pay in 2014, out of a prison system that averages more than 150,000 prisoners every year. As theVICE investigation showed, many prisoners either emptytheir \"trust funds\"(a.k.a. commissary accounts) to qualify as indigentwhich entitles them for free careor else avoidseeing a doctor altogether so they don't have to pass the burden of scraping together money for the co-pay onto their families.\nWhich is to say the co-payonly hits a chunk of the inmate population, but when it does, it hits hard.\nIn an email,the director of public information for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice(TDCJ), Jason Clark, suggestedofficials were noteven considering raising the co-pay. \"Any change to co-pay amount would require legislative approval and there are no bills currently before the Legislature regarding offender medical co-pays,\" Clark wrote.\nTestimony delivered to state lawmakers earlier this weekand a conversation with atleast one of them suggest otherwise.Jennifer Erschabek,executive director of the Texas Inmate Families Association, which advocates on behalf of the families of the incarcerated, went so far as to say stateprison officials arerunning a \"shell game\" where the fee increase is decided on duringongoing budget negotiations without sufficient public debate.\n\"The spokesman is saying there's no bill out there, because of course there's no bill out there,\" Erschabek told me. \"They're negotiating it right now.\"(Follow-up requests for comment to TDCJwent unanswered.)\nKelsey Vela, a fiscal coordinator for the Legislative Budget Board,testifiedMonday to statelawmakers on theCorrections Committeethat \"funding alternatives\" for the prison healthcare system \"include raising the offender healthcare fee from $100 to $200.\" Vela then submitted a report to the committee that included details of the fee increase, by \"amending Government Code 501.063 to increase the offender healthcare fee from $100 to $200 per year.\"\nThe report goes on to say that while 50 percentof offenders are deemed indigent, and therefore don't pay for their healthcare at the moment, \"funding for an increased health care fee would be drawn from future trust fund deposits.\"For advocates like Erschabek, this revelation is \"shocking,\" as the plan meansplacing even more of a burden on Texas families by increasing the amount that will be docked from deposits to commissary accounts.\nBut James White, a state representative andchairmanof the Corrections Committee,is seriously considering the co-pay increase proposal.\n\"In lean times, we take a particularly close look at recommendations, and we will weigh this proposal relative to all of the other cost-saving measures,\" White, whovoted in favor of installing the original co-pay in 2011, told me. \"In times where in the free worldfamilies are suffering through escalating healthcare costs, they're paying co-pays,they're paying deductiblesthere's no reason why we can't ask prisoners to do the same.\"\nPressed on whether the co-pay hasbeen placing an additional and unduehardship on the families of the incarcerated,White recoiled.\n\"Let's get a grip. We're not requiring this of the families,\" he said. \"The inmate receives healthcare whether they have money or not. The money is sent to the offender. It's under the control of the offender.\" White then compared the commissary account to a checking account used by college students, where their parents fill the account with money, but the students choose how to spend it. \nWatch the Daily VICEsegment on the app that promises to test what's in your weed. \n\nTexas's state government only meets once every two years for a marathon series of legislation and budget negotiations. This time around, Texas governor Greg Abbott has proposed a scorched-earth budget that started with a hiring freeze on all state employees. He's also looking to cut funds across the board, seeking an almost 3 percent reduction in discretionary spending .\nHealthcare for Texas's sprawling criminal justice system cost the state roughlya billion dollarslast year, whilethe state collected just $2.5 millionfrom the co-pay.\n\"This co-pay is totally indifferent to the burden that it puts on the families,\" Erschabek, the inmate family advocate, said. \"It's just crazy the band-aids they're trying to use to cover a system they can no longer afford.\"\nFollow Max Rivlin-Nadler on Twitter .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:15:23.730+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
