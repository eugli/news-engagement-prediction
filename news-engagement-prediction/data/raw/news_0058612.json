REUTERS/Ilana Panich-Linsman/File Photo Reuters \nAUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - A U.S. judge in Austin issued a preliminary injunction on Tuesday halting Texas' plan to cut Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood, saying the state did not present evidence of a program violation that would warrant termination. \nU.S. District Judge Sam Sparks said state health officials, \"likely acted to disenroll qualified health care providers from Medicaid without cause.\" He said the preliminary injunction will preserve the court's ability to render a meaningful decision on the case's merits. \n\"Such action would deprive Medicaid patients of their statutory right to obtain health care from their chosen qualified provider,\" the judge wrote. \nThe reproductive healthcare group has said the threatened funding cut, by terminating Planned Parenthood's enrollment in the state-funded healthcare system for the poor, could affect nearly 11,000 patients across Texas as they try to access services such as HIV and cancer screenings. \nTexas and several other Republican-controlled states have pushed to cut the organization's funding since an anti-abortion group released videos it said showed Planned Parenthood officials negotiating prices for fetal tissue collected from abortions. \nTexas investigated Planned Parenthood over the videos and a grand jury last January cleared it of any wrongdoing. The grand jury indicted two people who made the videos for document fraud but the charges were later dismissed. \nPlanned Parenthood has denied any wrongdoing. \n(Reporting by Jon Herskovitz; Editing by James Dalgleish and Grant McCool) \nCopyright 2017 Thomson Reuters .
