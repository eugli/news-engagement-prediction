But Gemma Bodinetz’s loving but firm and elegantly spare revival is triumphant. The story of milkman Tevye and his five daughters is played out in the round on a largely bare stage above which lightbulbs twinkle like unforgiving stars. This is one community – a Russian village in 1905 – talking directly to another: the Everyman audience of Liverpool, a 21st-century metropolis that has seen great change over a generation. Liverpool Everyman reveals first repertory 'cast' in 25 years Read more \nWhile full of warmth and charm, and no little joy, the production is always alert to this piece’s potential for what Philip Roth described as “shtetl kitsch”. There is no getting away from the fact that Joseph Stein and Jerry Bock’s musical features what must be the world’s politest pogrom. \nThis is not the best-sung Fiddler you will ever encounter. The 14-strong cast have been chosen for their versatility over a wide range of plays, from Manfred Karge ’s The Conquest of the South Pole to a Romeo and Juliet in which Juliet becomes Julius. But what is lost sometimes in the strength of the vocals is more than made up for in the clear-eyed characterisations. Patrick Brennan is terrific as the harassed milkman, particularly in his sweetly unaffected and very direct relationship with his god. This is a man who seems a gentle soul and yet is brutal in his rejection of the daughter who marries a gentile. But Bodinetz’s Fiddler is very much an ensemble piece from an ensemble company. \nShe remains true to the original but steers it from cosiness into far darker territory with the lightest of touches, including a final moment that brings it vividly up to date. We watch Tevye and his family cling to a way of life in their little “corner of the world”, oblivious to the winds of change blowing towards them. We know what will happen. “You can’t close your eyes to what is going on in the world,” the revolutionary student Perchik tells the villagers. Bodinetz hints that we are all Tevyes to some degree, preferring to close our eyes to technological, environmental and social change. \nThe final moments of this revival gently underline the fact that what might appear to be about then is also about now. As old certainties collapse, we cannot avoid being caught up in the gathering storm. \n• At the Everyman, Liverpool , until 11 March. Box office: 0151-709 4776.
