The closest thing to it is Golden State and Cleveland, which could end up being a great rivalry, but outside of that, you don’t have any individual rivalries, a Kobe vs. LeBron. Individual rivalries are just not there anymore.” \nPierce points out the simmering dislike between LeBron James and Stephen Curry’s squads, but he is correct that outside of those two teams there aren’t many rivalries to be had. \nOld guys like Charles Barkley, Michael Jordan, Kevin Garnett and Kobe Bryant have all voiced some variation of this same sentiment in recent years and there is a lot more friendship present in the league than there was before. \nUnfortunately for all the older players, the league has never been more entertaining from a scoring perspective and as long as this is the case, the rivalries simply just aren’t as important as they used to be.
