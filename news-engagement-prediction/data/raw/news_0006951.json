According to Lavasa, there is no parallel for this in the world. \nSpeaking at a post-Budget 2017 session organised by FICCI today, Lavasa said that the government has taken a series of measures to change the way the system delivers services to its people. “A series of measures have been taken to change the system – Aadhaar is one such example which is extremely important for effective delivery of services, not only by the government, but also by the private sector,”. Lavasa said. “A large number of private firms are now making use of the Aadhaar card to provide services to consumers,” he added. \nAccording to Lavasa, the focus of the Budget has been to pump in money in sectors where there are chances of huge growth. Talking about the various schemes of the government, Lavasa said, “A lot of savings are coming in because of expansion of the e-marketplace. Direct Benefit Transfers are helping the government track expenditure till the point that it should reach. \nYou may also like to watch this \nSpeaking of the dependence on global trade, Lavasa said that nations have to increasingly accept the reality that the growth of the economy cannot be dependent on it. “Global trade will not vanish, but the contribution that it makes to the growth of a domestic economy will decline – that is something that we need to be prepared for,” he said. \nMetaphorically comparing Budget to a movie story, Lavasa said that the industry needs less surprises and more predictability. “The story that this budget is narrating is consistent with the policies that the government is working on. The Budget need not be filled with tales of heroism. Everyone needs predictability in the regime,” he said.
