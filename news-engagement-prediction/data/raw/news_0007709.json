But May isn’t budging. \nWhen Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has been leading a campaign to block Trump from visiting Buckingham Palace, slammed May on Wednesday for not canceling her invitation to the president, she delivered a no-holds-barred response. \n“He can lead a protest, I’m leading a country,” she charged. \nIt is important to note, too, that, according to White House press secretary Sean Spicer, the invitation was made by May “on behalf of” Queen Elizabeth II, so the invite does not appear to be the prime minister’s to rescind. On behalf of Her Majesty the Queen, UK PM @theresa_may invited @potus for a state visit \n— Sean Spicer (@PressSec) January 27, 2017 \nCorbyn argued in front of the prime minister that Trump has “torn up” international agreements on refugees, taking issue with the president’s 120-day freeze of the U.S.’s refugee resettlement program, and “incited hatred” against Muslims with his 90-day moratorium on entry into the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority countries. \nAll of this backlash came after May visited the U.S. last week to meet with Trump at the White House, where the two leaders held a joint press conference Friday. Trump signed the executive order that evening, following May’s visit. \nWith little to no evidence, several of May’s political opponents suggested she was aware of the executive order before it was signed. Even Tim Farron, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said it was “disgraceful” that May knew about Trump’s action and didn’t speak out against it, according to The Sun . \nDuring his diatribe against Trump, Corbyn referred to a petition on the British Parliament’s website that has garnered more than 1.8 million signatures, stating Trump “should not be invited to make an official State Visit because it would cause embarrassment to Her Majesty the Queen.” \nHitting back at Corbyn, May said the politician’s statements are an “insult” to the democratically elected president of Britain’s “most important ally” — the United States. \nMay, who leads the Conservative Party, then went on to say that, despite suggestions by members of Parliament, she did not have any prior awareness of Trump’s executive order. \nWith support from her fellow Tories, the prime minister went on to ask a series of questions, according to The Sun , making the case that even if she did know about the order, chastising Trump on the matter would do little to help the U.K. \nMay wondered what Corbyn could have done that she didn’t do if he was prime minister: “Would he have been able to protect British citizens from the impact of the executive order?” \n“No,” several Tories replied. \nMay continued her questioning, pointing out that she was able to get Trump “ 100 percent behind ” NATO, a union the president had previously called “ obsolete .” \n“Would [Corbyn] have been able to lay the foundations of a trade deal? No. Would he have gotten a 100 percent commitment to NATO? No,” May said. \nUnder Corbyn’s leadership, the prime minister concluded, the U.K. would be “less prosperous, less safe.” \nThe entire heated exchange occurred after Corbyn, a deeply unpopular politician, loosely compared Trump to Adolf Hitler and May to former Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, who was attacked for appeasing the Nazi leader in 1938. \nChamberlain signed the Munich Agreement on Sept. 30, 1938 , which promised to avoided the outbreak of war as long as Czechoslovakia was given to the Fuhrer. The prime minister returned to Britain after striking the deal, when he famously said the meeting had achieved “peace in our time.” \nUltimately, of course, that wasn’t what happened. Hitler broke his promise and invaded Poland one year later, launching a war between Germany and Britain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T06:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:43:07.761+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
