Matt Taylor Central Coast Gosford Express Advocate Share Share on Twitter \nIT’S the Chinese year of the rooster, but there’s still nothing to crow about for the backers of a much-hyped oriental wonderland at Warnervale. \nThe Chappypie China Time project has been dogged by controversy since plans for a ‘Chinese Disneyland’ to rival the Sydney Opera House as a tourist attraction­ were unveiled to great fanfare on August 4, 2014. \nA shares storm and the planning department sending the project back to the drawing board in mid-2015 put a smog cloud over the once-touted $500 million tourism game-changer for the Central Coast. Saying their prayers: ACTP boss Bruce Zhong, former Wyong Mayor Doug Eaton, Master Yao Lai and Master Yao Ru with the proposed Chinese temple model on display in August 2015 at Westfield Tuggerah.

It came after the former Wyong Council’s acting chief executive Rob Noble recommended just days earlier that it should cut links to the company. But in a confidential meeting, councillors instead voted 5-4 to instruct Mr Noble to renegotiate a new agreement with the company. \nMr Noble did just that and a new deal was struck on February 3, 2016. The site of the proposed Chinese theme park on Sparks Rd in Warnervale.   \nThe council said that contracts had been exchanged at that time and the company had 12 months to make a first payment of $3 million for the 15ha of land on Sparks Rd (the remaining $7 million is required in the next 12 months), otherwise the deal was off. It also said it had received $600,000 in deposits from ACTP. \nA year on and Central Coast Council says it still hasn’t received the $3 million. But it now says the money is not due until next month. \nAsked whether this was yet another deadline extension, it simply reaffirmed that a March settlement was part of the terms of agreement. \nThe Express Advocate tried to break through the company’s great wall of secrecy­ for the umpteenth time to find out if it was on track to make the land payment. \nHowever, we could not contact any of the directors in recent days.

In the three previous years it had increased by 10 per cent. \nAt this rate, NSW Opposition Central Coast spokesman David Harris said on Friday that ratepayers could have expected at least $1 million more in the deal. State Labor Member for Wyong David Harris has labelled the ongoing controversy surrounding the much-hyped Chinese theme park as a “complete farce”.

It’s gone on for far too long. And it’s ratepayers who are the losers in all this.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T11:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T07:17:59.093+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
