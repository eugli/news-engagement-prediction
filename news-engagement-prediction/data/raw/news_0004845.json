A welcome return?\nHuawei/YouTube screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET What is it with famous spokesmen from tech ads?\nDo they adore advertising so much that they just can't get enough? Or does appearing in long-running campaigns affect their acting careers?\nLast year, it was Verizon's \"Can You Hear Me Now\" Paul Marcarelli resurrected in ads for rival Sprint.\nAnd now it's Justin Long. The so-very-likable young man who personified the Apple brand -- and mercilessly mocked Bill Gates's Microsoft -- in the long-running and brilliant \"Get A Mac\" ads is back in the tech arena. As a defector.\nHe's in a new campaign for Huawei.\nThe first ad sees him interviewing for the job of directing the ad. \n\"I have a ton of experience in tech,\" he begins. \"Have I ever directed anything? No. Do I have a director's outfit? A scarf, a hat and a vest? Yes.\" \nAnd then we see that he's being interviewed by the new Huawei Mate 9 phone, which, instead of speaking, shows him pretty pictures. \nThere's another 45 seconds of this, sadly. The ad has all the lofty humor of someone wearing a recycling bag at Thanksgiving dinner. It has all the drive of drivel. \nMore Technically Incorrect Rihanna and Azealia Banks dial up fight over Trump Refugee ban leads to airport chaos, but Trump blames anything else Baby dolphin dies after tourists pull it out of the water for selfies, report says Of course, it could be that subsequent ads will be garlanded with memorable wit. My hope springs eternal, or at least to the next session of Congress.\nNeither Huawei nor Apple immediately responded to a request for comment. A member of Huawei's ad team did tell Campaign magazine , however, that Long was chosen specifically because of his Apple ad days, which ended in 2009.\nThe grizzled will suggest that a company that's been accused of copying products shouldn't also take spokesmen from another brand.\nThe severely grizzled might suggest that if you are going to use another brand's iconic spokesman, the ads had better be very, very good.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T22:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:32:19.999+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
