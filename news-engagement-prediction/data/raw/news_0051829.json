It is also to ensure that it thrives. \n\"So it is our responsibility not only to protect life from crime, war, epidemic diseases and other afflictions, but also to further it, quantitatively, for example, by expanding provision of health care that lengthens people's lives and, qualitatively, by providing for an enhanced quality of life. \nNajib said the natural result of protecting and furthering these objectives meant that any society that did so was on the path of civilisation. \n\"A state in which quality of life, religious philosophy and practice, and intellectual development are all supported and cherished,\" he said. \nNajib said this was why Abdullah had championed \"Civilisational Islam\" or \"Islam Hadhari\", because the values of a civilisation were what sustained it. \n\"This is also why I have championed moderation - or wasatiyyah as the path of the best, for moderation is the path of human perfection, an idea that is taught to us by Islam as well as other religions,\" he said. \nNajib said Malaysia had taken the role as khalifah very seriously, in fact sustainability was one of the three pillars of the New Economic Model that was announced in 2010. \n\"And I'm proud to be able to say that under the 10th Malaysia Plan (2011-2015), we achieved a 33 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions,\" he said. \nEarlier, Najib officiated at Ikim's Silver Jubilee celebration and launched its four latest publications. \n- Bernama \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T19:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T14:17:32.319+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
