Key points: New arms limitation treaty between US, Russia requires both countries to limit nuclear arsenals to equal levels for 10 years Mr Trump called it a \"one-sided deal\", added the US will \"start making good deals\" He also declared the US was \"very angry\" at North Korea's ballistic missile tests \nMr Trump also said China could solve the national security challenge posed by North Korea \"very easily if they want to\", ratcheting up pressure on Beijing to exert more influence to rein in Pyongyang's increasingly bellicose actions. \nIn his first comments about the US nuclear arsenal since taking office on January 20, Mr Trump said the United States had \"fallen behind on nuclear weapon capacity\". \n\"I am the first one that would like to see nobody have nukes, but we're never going to fall behind any country even if it's a friendly country, we're never going to fall behind on nuclear power,\" he said. \n\"It would be wonderful, a dream would be that no country would have nukes, but if countries are going to have nukes, we're going to be at the top of the pack.\" \nThe new strategic arms limitation treaty, known as New START, between the US and Russia requires that by February 5, 2018, both countries must limit their arsenals of strategic nuclear weapons to equal levels for 10 years. \nThe treaty permits both countries to have no more than 800 deployed and non-deployed land-based ballistic missile launchers and heavy bombers equipped to carry nuclear weapons, and contains equal limits on other nuclear weapons. \nAnalysts have questioned whether Mr Trump wants to abrogate New START or would begin deploying other warheads. \nIn the interview, Mr Trump called New START \"a one-sided deal\". \n\"Just another bad deal that the country made, whether it's START, whether it's the Iran deal ... we're going to start making good deals,\" he said. \nThe United States is in the midst of a $US1 trillion, 30-year modernisation of its aging ballistic missile submarines, bombers and land-based missiles, a price tag most experts say the country cannot afford. Trump angry at Russia, North Korea \nMr Trump also complained the Russian deployment of a ground-based cruise missile was in violation of a 1987 treaty that banned land-based American and Russian intermediate-range missiles. \n\"To me it's a big deal,\" Mr Trump said. \nAsked if he would raise the issue with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Mr Trump said he would do so \"if and when we meet\". He said he had no meetings scheduled as of yet with Mr Putin. \nSpeaking from the Oval Office, Mr Trump declared \"we're very angry\" at North Korea's ballistic missile tests and said accelerating a missile defence system for US allies Japan and South Korea was among many options available. \n\"There's talks of a lot more than that,\" Mr Trump said, when asked about the missile defence system. \n\"We'll see what happens. But it's a very dangerous situation, and China can end it very quickly in my opinion.\" \nReuters First posted February 24, 2017 08:36:07 The Trump presidency", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:10:58.970+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
