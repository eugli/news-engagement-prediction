(ABC News: Lexy Hamilton-Smith) \nThe 65-year-old said telling people of her initial diagnosis often led to hurtful reactions and people asking he if she was a smoker. \n\"It is horrible — it is not so much what they say, but how they react — the implied accusation that you have really brought it on yourself is really cruel,\" Ms Nelson said. \n\"If someone is diagnosed with breast cancer the last thing they are going to say is: 'you must have been a heavy drinker' or 'gee, you have been pretty overweight for a long time'.\" Australians' attitudes 'unfair' \nLung Foundation Australia chief executive officer Michelle Allan said the study's findings were nothing to be proud of. \n\"Whatever the attitude, it is unfair — we need to have empathy and we need to understand that anyone can get lung cancer,\" Ms Allan said. Top 10 lung cancer risk factors: smoking cigarettes personal or family history radiotherapy treatment to the chest exposure to radon — a naturally occurring radioactive gas that can build up inside houses in some areas exposure to asbestos fibres workplace exposure — to asbestos; nickel, arsenic, soot, tar or diesel fumes exposure to air pollution infection with HIV a history of certain diseases of the lungs, including tuberculosis, fungal infections of the lungs, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pulmonary fibrosis Supplied: Lung Foundation Australia \nShe said one in three women and one in 10 men diagnosed with lung cancer had never smoked, but those people only had a 15 per cent, five-year survival rate. \nThe Menzies Health Institute of Queensland has studied attitudes towards the disease to try to find out why Australians were so uncaring towards lung cancer patients. \nInstitute director Professor Suzanne Chambers said it had a lot to do with the success of the anti-smoking campaigns. \n\"We have de-normalised smoking and that has been an important thing to reduce the rates of smoking to reduce cancer,\" she said. \n\"The flipside of that though is for people who are actually diagnosed with lung cancer they can feel like 'well, it is my fault'. \n\"I have certainly had people with lung cancer tell me they wished they had breast cancer — it is all warm pink and fuzzy and there is nothing warm pink and fuzzy about lung cancer.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T03:16:17.943+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
