\nHospital trusts in England are legally obliged to check whether patients are eligible for free non-emergency NHS treatment and to recover any costs. \nThe report identifies the biggest challenge to recovering costs as the lack of a single easy way to prove whether patients are entitled to healthcare. \nThe committee notes that while some trusts are now requiring patients to prove their identity by showing passports and utility bills, these documents do not demonstrate entitlement to free NHS care. \nSome patients, such as refugees and those applying for asylum, are exempt from charges. \nThe report says the Department of Health should build on existing systems, such as the NHS number and electronic patient record. \nThere are currently large variations between trusts in the amounts they charge and the debts they recover from overseas patients. \nThe committee says that trusts' performances should be shared and there should be intervention if a trust is falling short. \nAnd while GP appointments are free to everyone, the report says GPs could do more to help and the government should give clear guidelines on what is expected of them. \nDr Mark Porter council chairman for the British Medical Association, said: \"It is important that those accessing NHS service are eligible to do so and that we recover the costs for treating overseas visitors. \n\"The systems to do this need to be practical, economic and efficient and must not jeopardise access to healthcare for those who need it. \n\"Any charging systems should not prevent sick and vulnerable patients receiving necessary care, otherwise there may be serious consequences for their health and that of the public in general.\" Related Topics ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T10:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T05:45:21.172+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
