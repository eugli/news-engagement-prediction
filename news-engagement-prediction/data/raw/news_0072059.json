One third (31%) of guys say they’d feel embarrassed about seeking help for a mental health problem. Meanwhile just 34% say they’d feel comfortable talking openly about their feelings. \nTo tackle the problem head on, Time to Change has kicked off a five-year campaign encouraging men to “be in their mate’s corner” by being more open and supporting one another. \nAnd with suicide being the the leading cause of death among men under 45, it’s more important than ever.

Shortly after, he suffered a breakdown at work. \nIn 2013, he experienced a second depressive episode that lasted four months. \n“I wouldn’t wish how I felt on my worst enemy,” he said. “I had been facing some pretty big pressures in my life and I didn’t recognise who I was and didn’t have the ability to smile and laugh – as if a surgeon had cut it out.” \nThe club support officer for England Boxing said that his two close friends, Craig and Simon, helped him through it. \n“I’m very lucky to have two lifelong friends who have been a huge support to me when I was ill,” he explained. \n“I’ve always talked to Craig about everything. Simon, while we had never really talked a great deal about personal things, showed me he cared in other ways, by getting me out of the house regularly to play darts, giving me a short break from everything that was going on in my head.” Time To Change Matthew (pictured right) with his lifelong friend Craig (left). \nHis friend Craig Wood said he was in “complete shock” when Williams - who he’d known since they were boys - opened up about his mental illness. \nThe pair hadn’t seen each other in a while, but had planned to visit Leeds Festival together. When Williams went to pick up Wood, his friend immediately knew something was wrong. \n“He looked like he had not slept for a week, his eyes were empty and expressionless, and he struggled to reply when I asked him how he was,” Wood recalled. “I simply got a shake of the head and a garbled ‘not good’. \n“On the drive down, Matty proceeded to tell me about the dark place he was in. He found it difficult to speak and string a sentence together, and I found it hard to find the right words. \n“Here was my mate who I thought I knew as well as anyone, the life and soul, the one with the all the wisecracks, the one with the ‘gift of the gab’, and he could hardly speak, never mind describe how he was feeling.” SEE ALSO:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:12:23.150+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
