The question now is where and when the fight will take place. Manny Pacquiao (Getty Images) \nPublished on Feb. 22, 2017 \nFeb. 22, 2017 \nManny Pacquiao has lined up his next opponent. \nMORE: Freddie Roach tells why Mayweather-McGregor fight will happen \nA date and location for the bout are still to be determined. Pacquiao said 10 days earlier his next fight would take place in the United Arab Emirates, contrary to a supposed deal to defend the 147-pound belt against Australia's Jeff Horn in Brisbane, Australia, in April. That fight has fallen apart, Top Rank chairman Bob Arum told ESPN.com . \n\"The Australian deal is not going to happen now because Manny is trying to get a fight done in the United Arab Emirates and the people there favor him fighting Amir Khan,\" he said. \nArum, who promotes Pacquiao, said a fight with Khan will take place \"maybe in April or maybe June, but not May,\" which had been rumored. \nPacquiao, 38, last fought Nov. 5 in Las Vegas, defeating Jessie Vargas to reclaim the welterweight world title. \nKhan, 30, hasn't fought since May 2016 â€” a sixth-round knockout loss to Canelo Alvarez.
