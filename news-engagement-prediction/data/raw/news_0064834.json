While the previous administration offered inclusive guidance to schools on transgender rights, the government yesterday revoked a federal law that allowed transgender children access to the bathroom of the gender that they identify with. \nSpeaking with Axios , Apple released a statement condemning the move. \"Apple believes everyone deserves a chance to thrive in an environment free from stigma and discrimination. We support efforts toward greater acceptance, not less, and we strongly believe that transgender students should be treated as equals. We disagree with any effort to limit or rescind their rights and protections.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:41:19.794+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
