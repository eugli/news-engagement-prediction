Close Snake has tennis ball removed after mistaking it for food in Queensland UP NEXT VIDEO Snake has tennis ball removed after mistaking it for food in Queensland. Source: Townsville Snakehandler/ Facebook Snake has tennis ball removed after mistaking it for food in Queensland \nBut fortunately for the carpet python, the owners of a property at Belgian Gardens in Townsville noticed it had an unusually round lump and called a snake catcher for help on Monday. \nThe reptile was then taken to the Townsville Vet Clinic where it was examined and X-rays were taken. \nFollowing the X-rays, the professionals guessed the foreign object was a tennis ball and that the snake had made the poor meal choice not too long before it was spotted. \n\"It had gas around the ball on the X-ray,\" senior veterinary nurse Trish Prendergast told 7News Online. \n\"We then assumed the snake had eaten it within the last 24 hours... because of that we decided that the best way to remove it would be to manually manipulate it.\" A snake had a tennis ball removed in Queensland. Source: Townsville Snakehandler/ Facebook \nMs Prendergast, who is also a licensed snake catcher and handler, said the snake received some lubrication, reportedly paraffin oil, to ease the process, and it took between 20 to 30 minutes to manually push the ball up. \nShe said once the object was removed the snake received an anti-inflammatory injection as its oesophagus may have been irritated. \nMs Prendergast said it would have eaten the ball as it would have smelt like a \"prey item\". It is believed the snake thought the object was a prey item. Source: Townsville Snakehandler/ Facebook \nDuring its recovery the snake has appeared happy, sitting up in the cage and there have been no ill effects noticed since the removal of the ball. \nOn Thursday morning the reptile was fed for the first time successfully. \nMs Prendergast said it was lucky the snake was found pretty quickly, as it wouldn't have been able to digest food properly, claiming it would have starved eventually. \nThe tennis ball is not the first unusual item Ms Prendergast has had to remove, with other snakes swallowing things like plastic chicken eggs and a golf ball. \nThe animal who had swallowed the golf ball required an extensive operation. Anyone who spots a snake who has swallowed an unusual object is urged to contact a professional for help.
