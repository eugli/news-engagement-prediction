Could   \nEat your heart out Hedwig, because there's a parliament of owls headed for Manchester to show off their Hogwarts-style skills. \nThe visiting owls will be at Manchester Central Library from midday on Saturday, February 4 as part of the annual international celebrations of J.K. Rowling's classic children's book Harry Potter . \nThey'll be delivering letters to their handlers once an hour - just like Hedwig did for Harry - at the library's special event, A Harry Potter Celebration. \nAnd the squad chosen to emulate Hedwig's spellbinding skills is expected to include everything from a White Faced Owl to the grand European Eagle Owl.

All other experiences do not require a ticket. \nA Harry Potter Celebration runs from 12pm until 4pm as part of the ongoing Library Live season. \nCostumes, wands and Butterbeer tankards are optional!
