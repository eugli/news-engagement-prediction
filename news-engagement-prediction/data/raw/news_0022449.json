Totally unexpected, but in a great way.”\nMassive snowball fights have become something of a tradition during serious snowstorms in the region.\nIn 2013, around 50 people showed up for a planned snowball fight on the Common, following winter storm “Nemo.”\nAnd last year, the “colleges of Boston” tried to bring together students to battle it out at the public park.\nSteve Annear can be reached at steve.annear@globe.com .
