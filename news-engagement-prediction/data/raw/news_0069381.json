Picture by Scott Fletcher THE female rugby league players with a shot of defending their historic state of origin victory from last year were today named by New South Wales Rugby League. \nThe 22 players will gather this weekend at Sydney Oluympic Park for a camp, the first session of the 2017 Women’s Pathways Program. \nSeven more sessions will be held between now and midyear, when the interstate challenge will be played on the weekend of July 21-23. \nOther players still have a chance to make the squad as coaching staff will watch the NSW women’s premiership and Tarsha Gale Cup for emerging talent. \nFor the first time, the female Pathways Program will be directly aligned to the male Pathways program. NSW defeated Queensland for the first time in 17 years in 2016.
