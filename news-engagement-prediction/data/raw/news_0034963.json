Dianne Feinstein announced Friday that she will introduce legislation that would require Olympic national governing bodies to immediately report sexual abuse allegations to authorities. \nFeinstein, D-California, said the legislation is in response to USA Gymnastics' handling of such allegations. \nOn Thursday, the sport's national governing body acknowledged that it delayed reporting sex abuse allegations against its longtime team physician for five weeks, while it conducted an internal investigation. And an ongoing IndyStar investigation revealed that the organization failed to alert authorities to many allegations of sexual abuse by coaches. \nAlso today, Feinstein and three other senators said they sent USA Gymnastics a letter last month calling for the organization to implement stricter internal policies to weed out abuse. \nCiting IndyStar's investigation, the four senators wrote a letter to Indianapolis-based USA Gymnastics last August expressing \"deep concern\" about the national governing body's handling of such cases. \nUSA Gymnastics President Steve Penny sent a lengthy response last year that detailed steps the organization has taken to try to protect athletes. \nThe recent letter from the four senators — including Feinstein, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut — called Penny's answers to their concerns \"inadequate.\" \nThe letter, dated Jan. 31, urged Penny to implement four specific changes, saying sexual abuse \"has to stop, and we believe USA Gymnastics must do more than what has been publicly stated.\" Those changes include immediate mandatory reporting of all sexual abuse allegations, a \"victim-centered\" approach for reporting abuse that might include an anonymous hotline, stronger rules on training and broader background screenings. \nFeinstein's announcement Friday comes the day after it was revealed that USA gymnastics did not report allegations about Dr. Larry Nassar to the FBI until more than five weeks after it received the initial report. \nUSA Gymnastics reported Nassar to the FBI in July 2015, but the sexual abuse allegations but the investigation languished for more than a year. \nSexual abuse allegations about Nassar, who was the women's national team physician for 29 years, only became public after a two former gymnasts came forward to IndyStar last August. Nassar, 53, is now in jail in Michigan on state charges of criminal sexual conduct with a person younger than 13 and federal child pornography charges. \n\"News reports, civil and criminal cases, as well as discussions I’ve had with sex abuse victims, appear to reveal systemic problems within USA Gymnastics that have allowed allegations of sexual abuse go unreported,\" Feinstein said in a statement Friday. \"I met with some of the victims and it was one of the most powerful, emotional meetings I’ve had during my 24 years in the Senate. The abuse these women suffered will stay with them the rest of their lives.\" \nThis article will be updated. \nCall IndyStar reporter Marisa Kwiatkowski at (317) 444-6135.
