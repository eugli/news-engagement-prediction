They will proscribe all the opposing political parties while refusing to allow the registration of new ones, insisting on running a one party state to the detriment of democracy. \n“Such dictatorial tendencies negate the founding principles of the labour movement, which thus dethrone us from the moral high ground to correct other actors within the democratic space. \n“ULC is sorrowful that such comrades will seek to hold Nigerian workers captive under their bondage, denying them every possible right to freely chose platforms that best suits their desires and expectations. \n“It goes against our traditions and norms as a labour movement to encourage slavery in any form, either in the workplaces or within the trade unions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T09:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T07:52:36.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
