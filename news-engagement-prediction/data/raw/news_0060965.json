Eight-goal thriller! Relive a phenomenal night at the Etihad as #CityvMonaco served up a classic! :raised_hands: #UCL https://t.co/V1V1TGbipw - BT Sport Football (@btsportfootball) February 21, 2017 \nWhilst Guardiola and his star-studded squad will take a lead to France in three weeks time, pundit for Irish TV Graeme Souness really didn't enjoy the City performance, particularly in the first-half: \nWe have absolutely no idea how the second leg will end next month but we are counting the minutes until kick-off already. \nWhat do you make of Souness's comments? Is he right to slaughter Guardiola's tactics? \nLet us know in the comments section, below. \nThis story was first featured on talkingbaws.com - simple, shareable sport.
