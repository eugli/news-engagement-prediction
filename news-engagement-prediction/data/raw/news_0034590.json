The tie might be effectively over, but the storm has only just started. \nEverything. They were outworked in midfield, overrun in defence, and the superstar forward line of Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar had virtually no impact, although the Brazilian at least made a handful of dangerous runs. \nFrom a tactical point of view, the first of those points is the most significant, because PSG's outstanding midfield trio of Marco Verratti, Adrien Rabiot and Blaise Matuidi completely controlled the centre of the field and the flow of the game. \nTheir dominance was plainly evident in the second, third and fourth goals, all of which saw PSG players breeze unchallenged through the heart of midfield, with no opponents putting any pressure on the ball whatsoever, before calmly delivering passes for Julian Draxler, Angel di Maria and Edinson Cavani to convert. \nIndeed, it could have been even worse, with Barca keeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen the only visiting player to emerge with any credit after making some decent saves to repel similarly rampaging PSG attacks as his defence offered next to no protection. \nA team like Barca repeatedly being so easily carved open was a shocking sight, and the disconnect between their defence and attack - with nothing in between as PSG enjoyed the Parc des Princes' wide open spaces - was the main factor behind the vast gulf between the teams. \nHad anyone seen this coming? \nOf course, nobody was predicting that Barca would lose so heavily in Paris. \nBut although the scale of the defeat was unexpected, many fans are now bitterly saying \"I told you so\" after a season which has regularly threatened to fall apart at the seams. \nDespite the success he enjoyed during his first two seasons in charge, many observers have remained unconvinced by Luis Enrique's abilities as a coach, claiming that his only tactical plan is to let Messi do what he wants and hope for the best. \nThat is an exaggeration, of course, but the fact that Enrique did not even use all his available substitutions in Paris despite a horrendous collective performance suggests he is desperately lacking a back-up if his Plan A - relying upon the MSN forward line - fails to prosper. \nAlthough they possess enough individual talent to brush aside inferior opposition, throughout the season Barca have routinely struggled whenever they come up against top-quality teams - with the 3-1 group-stage defeat at Manchester City offering just one example. \nBarca were also poor in last week's Copa del Rey semi-final against Atletico Madrid, only sneaking through after Atletico missed several clear chances (including a penalty) and had a goal wrongly disallowed, and the Catalans have dropped points in La Liga against Real Madrid, Atletico, Real Sociedad and Villarreal. \nIndeed, the only team in La Liga's top six they have beaten so far this season is Sevilla, and that was only thanks to a remarkable performance from Messi - the prototype Enrique win, according to his many detractors. \nHow did the Spanish media react? \nAlthough the players have not escaped criticism, manager Luis Enrique has been well and truly placed in the firing line. \nThe Barca boss conducted a particularly feisty post-match interview with Catalan broadcaster TV3, firing back \"You can tell you didn't watch the game\" after it was suggested he had not made any tactical changes during the course of the match. \nThere were even suggestions that Enrique was later restrained from accosting the reporter, Jordi Grau, because he was so upset by the negative tone of the interview. \nIf that was the case, Enrique will be awfully unhappy with a lot of members of the media because he has faced widespread and fierce criticism. \nAn opinion piece in Sport, a newspaper published in Barcelona, described the team as \"shipwrecked without a manager\", handing Enrique possibly the worst insult imaginable in that particular city by likening him to Jose Mourinho in his treatment of the media (\"inventing enemies which don't exist\"). \nAnd naturally, Spain's pro-Real Madrid publications were more than happy to stick the knife in, with Marca describing the game as a \"catastrophe\" and calling it Barca's \"biggest debacle of the 21st century.\" \nPublished: 15-02-2017 08:40 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T05:08:52.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
