Bi-polar, post natal depression, and PTSD, does that make my opinion void.\" \nThe mother-of-two explained that the PTSD came after losing her son six months into her pregnancy in 2010. \nShe described the ordeal, writing: \"I lay in a hospital bed with my deceased son stuck between my legs halfway out of my body for 10 hours.\" @Lumix_Trident @Ged_2345 when I lay in a hospital bed with my deceased son stuck between my legs halfway out of my body for 10 hours. — Lily (@lilyallen) February 25, 2017 \nThe anxiety disorder is caused by distressing, stressful or disturbing events and can cause nightmares and flashbacks. \nPeople with bipolar disorder have periods of depression, where they are feel low and lethargic, and episodes of mania, where they are overactive and very high.
