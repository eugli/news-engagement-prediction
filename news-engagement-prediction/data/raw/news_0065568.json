Mytchall Bransgrove/Fairfax NZ \nThe safety camera network also includes 43 speed camera vans. \nPolice are now reviewing their ownership of the network. \nREAD MORE: * Lawyer gets speed camera ticket thrown out \nDetails of the move were revealed in a briefing from New Zealand Transport Agency chief executive Fergus Gammie to the Minister of Transport, obtained under the Official Information Act. \nIn it Gammie said both the police and agency had agreed a review was needed for several reasons. \nThese included the fact that the level of resources required to run the network diverted resources away from other road policing priorities. \n\"[There is] the need to continuously increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the police's workforce by ensuring all staff are undertaking the right activities at the right times to address road safety risks.\" \nOther reasons for the review included an increase in the use of technology in the network and higher interest from road controlling authorities to own and manage items such as red light cameras. Ad Feedback \nBoth the police and NZTA declined interview requests. \nBut in a written statement, police national road policing manager Superintendent Steve Greally said transferring the network management to the NZTA or a private/public partnership were both possibilities. \nIf the latter was chosen, statutory oversight by a government agency would remain a key requirement. \nIt was also possible the network would continue to be managed by police following the review. \nGreally noted that all traffic fines went to the Government's consolidated fund and not to police. \n\"The aim of the safety camera system is not to generate fines, but to encourage people to travel at legal safe speeds and therefore reduce speed-related deaths and injuries. \n\"This would remain the focus of the system regardless of whatever future operating model may be in place.\" \nThe briefing document noted the review provided an opportunity to explore how the safety network could be integrated into intelligent transport systems, such as those used on the Wellington Smart Motorway and Auckland's Waterview Tunnel. \nNZTA road safety director Harry Wilson said it would simplify matters to have one organisation responsible for both camera enforcement and network management. \nInformation about traffic flows and speeds, bottlenecks, and crashes could be used to set the operating hours of speed cameras so they were targeted to risk areas. \nIt could also work in the other direction, with areas with a high rate of offending possibly needing new road design or signage, he said. \nThe review is expected to be completed by October. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:26:26.081+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
