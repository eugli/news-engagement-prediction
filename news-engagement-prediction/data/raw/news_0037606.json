Rochelle Riley , Detroit Free Press Columnist 11:21   Buy Photo (Photo: John Froelich, DFP) Buy Photo   \nHe was one of the greatest and most beloved athletes in his field. \nHe still holds the record as longest-reigning champion in his sport. \nHis name is synonymous with the best of Detroit because he brought glory and honor to a city that craved it. \nSo when the $600-million Little Caesars Arena opens next season amid fanfare and the celebration of surrounding neighborhoods — and the hockey lights go out on the massive house that bears the name Joe Louis — what happens then? \nRead more: New   \nI’m not asking about the massive structure whose banners commemorate four Stanley Cup victories won in the Joe and 11 overall, an NHL record. \nI’m asking about the man who transcended his sport and was so beloved that his name graced an arena built for another sport. \nThe Joe is second only to Madison Square Garden in longevity, but the Joe is the only hockey arena in America named for a person. \nSo what will Detroit do to continue honoring the memory of the Brown Bomber? \nChildren deserve to know his story, how Joseph Louis Barrow’s mother, Lillie Barrow, made him take violin lessons to keep him away from local gangs and how he spent that violin lesson money to train at Brewster Recreation Center, fighting under the name Joe Louis to keep his mother from finding out. \nJoe Louis in 1935. (Photo: Associated Press) \nThey need to learn how he won the Detroit Golden Gloves light-heavyweight title in 1934, and then won 50 of his 54 matches as an amateur. \nThey need to grasp his professional career, how he beat James Braddock to become the world heavyweight champion and remained champion for an unprecedented 11 years and eight months. \nThey need to understand why people still talk about — and movies still reference — the 1938 rematch where Louis faced Max Schmeling and Nazi hatred — and he knocked both out in the first round. That fight made him a national hero. \nThe arena that bears his name was built two years before Joe Louis died of cardiac arrest in 1981. For nearly four decades the city — and a hockey team — have used that space to excel in sport and honor Louis, the grandson of slaves, the Alabama native who brought America glory, who changed boxing and who epitomized greatness. \nBesides boxing, Louis was a gracious gentleman who enlisted in the U.S. Army and gave money to war relief efforts, actions that endeared him as much to patriots as his dominance in boxing endeared him to sports fans. \nLouis retired the first time on March 1, 1949. He attempted a short failed comeback and finally left the sport with a 68-3 record. He was inducted into the Ring Magazine Boxing Hall of Fame in 1954 and the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1990, according to biography.com. \nThe year after his 1981 death, he received the Congressional Gold Medal along with novelist Louis L’Amour and bandleader Fred Waring. Ten years later, he became the first boxer to appear on a commemorative postage stamp. \nThat is a story that children must learn and Detroit must continue to honor. So when the Joe is torn down and hockey glory moves over to Little Caesars, what will become of the name that still deserves commemoration? \nIt is a question that deserves an answer for a legacy that deserves to be celebrated forever. \nRelated: \nContact Rochelle Riley: rriley99@freepress.com.
