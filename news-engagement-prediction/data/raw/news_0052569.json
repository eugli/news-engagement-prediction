Warwick Crown Court heard Medcraft lied about how the boy was injured (Photo: Birmingham Post and Mail) Read More \nMedcraft, who was not insured to drive the lorry, admitted child cruelty by neglecting the safety of the youngster, who was in the truck's cab unrestrained, reports the Coventry Telegraph. \nHe suffered a fractured skull, broken tooth and was seen to be bleeding from both nostrils. \nOther motorists watched in horror as the door was thrown open and the boy flew out as the truck went round a traffic island in Rugby. \nProsecutor Jennifer Josephs said: “To their horror, a small child fell from the truck to the floor and under the lorry, which was not going at a great speed, and Mr Medcraft was able to stop within a vehicle’s length. \n“He got out of the cab in a panic before pulling the boy from under the vehicle. \n“He lifted the boy back into the vehicle and immediately drove off, once again with the child unrestrained, and witnesses called the police.” Read More Police wearing bodycams go undercover as cyclists to catch drivers who overtake dangerously closely \nA few minutes later, unaware of the incident, officers saw Medcraft reversing the truck down the hard shoulder of the slip road leading onto the M6 . \nWhen he was questioned, he lied about how the boy had been injured, claiming the three-year-old had fallen out when he had stopped to let him go for a wee, the court heard. \nExplaining his death wish manoeuvre reversing down the slip road, he claimed he was heading to University Hospital in Coventry before realising it would be faster to get to Rugby's St Cross Hospital. \nThe lad was kept in for observation but later discharged. \nMedcraft said he had borrowed the lorry for a test drive with a view to buying it for use as a tow truck. \nMiss Josephs said Medcraft had convictions for dishonesty and was jailed in 2005 for supplying class A drugs \nDavid Everett, defending, insisted his client had put his criminal past behind him and made 'a dramatic improvement in recent years', becoming a family man and working as a landscape gardener. \nThe judge, Recorder David Chinery, said: “I am quite sure that since this incident it has been on your mind on an almost daily basis that, serious as the injuries to this little boy were, they could have been much more serious, or even fatal, if he had fallen under the wheels. \n“The reality is that in this case you allowed a three-year-old child to be sitting in the front seat without proper child seating and unrestrained. \n“That is the real failure on your part to protect this child from the injury he then sustained. \n“Because there was no proper seating and he was unrestrained, even if it had been in good condition, an emergency stop in such circumstances could also have caused an injury to this child.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:01:47.662+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
