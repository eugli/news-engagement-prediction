They've marks of physical injuries on their body to these assessors, but they failed to cross check [that] information and then give them a favourable response.\" \nBehrouz Boochani, an Iranian journalist detained on the island, described the attempted deportations as an attack. \nPosting on Twitter, Mr Boochani added that one man escaped while another had been \"taken\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T07:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T02:52:48.560+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
