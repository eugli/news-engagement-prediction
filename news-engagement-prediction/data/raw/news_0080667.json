Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase. \nAmazon \nThe iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have a new camera, no headphone jack, a better screen, and more in a package that looks both familiar and a little different. \nIf you want your new phone to be protected right out of the box, I suggest you pick up one of these cases. I already did. Spigen Amazon \nThis case has two parts to it: A shock-absorbing back and polyurethane bumper. The fact that the bumper is made out of a harder material is great, because phones that fall on a corner risk getting their screens messed up. Ringke Amazon \nIf you prefer the hard plastic look to a fancy color or pattern, Ringke's Fusion case should serve you well. I've had cases like this in the past; they've protected my phone from a few falls, while letting my phone's color act as the flair. Caseology Amazon \nIf you do prefer a funky-colored case that also protects your phone, Caseology has you covered. Like the first case, there are two components in this case, but this one comes assembled. The harder outer shell — with reinforced corners — and the plastic polycarbonate back. It's thin enough that you shouldn't notice a big size and weight difference, but strong enough to make sure your phone survives a tumble. Spigen Amazon \nIf you care more about protecting your phone than having it look cool, this case from Spigen is worth checking out. It's thicker than all the cases I've mentioned before, so it'll make your phone heavier and bigger. But the case does have military grade air cushion technology, so it should make dropping your phone backside down on concrete a non-issue. i-Blason Amazon \nThe most heavy duty case for the iPhone 7, this case extends over the front of your phone, protecting the screen. Don't get me wrong, if you drop this phone screen-side down on a rigged surface, there's still a chance it'll get shattered by a rock. But the case's lip should provide a good buffer between your screen and flat, hard surfaces like a hardwood floor. TOZO Amazon \nNow onto us \"Plus club\" members. This is the type of case I ended up going with. It's thin and clear enough that you can see the Apple logo, and it won't add too much girth to an already big device. It's definitely going to leave your iPhone open to screen shattering if you drop it screen-side down, but it does make it easy, or possible, to operate the bigger iPhone one-handed. NeWisdom Amazon \nA little more protection and a higher-end feeling material are what make this iPhone 7 Plus case worth a look. The leather will do a better job than the super thin case at absorbing drop damage, but still leaves your screen unprotected. The texture on the rubber will make the phone way more grippy, though, so if you find the iPhone is a little on the slippery side, this is the way to go. SUPCASE Amazon \nIf you've already resigned yourself to using this phone two-handed all the time, and your main priority is keeping it as safe as possible, this is the case for you. It protects both the front and back of your phone, and while it'll add a fair bit of bulk to your already big phone, it's a good trade-off for ample protection. SUPCASE Full-body Rugged Holster Case with Built-in Screen Protector for Apple iPhone 7 Plus, $18.99, available at Amazon \nThis article was originally published on 9/7/2016 and has been updated.
