There are lots of aspects to farming, and we try to provide at least some certainty that your soil resource is this and it's suitable for growing these crops. \n\"It helps them grow the right crops on the right land [that is] sustainable in the long term and doesn't have an impact on the environment.\" Good groundwater supply \nMr Hill said this was the first time information had been collected about the soil west of Tennant Creek. \n\"There was some water resources drilling done in the early 80s which indicated a good groundwater supply,\" he said. \n\"We're working together with water resources now to look at the soils and whether we've got that overlapping soil and water. \n\"In Ali Curung, we've had some reconnaissance work done there in the past soil-wise, but this is the first time we've gone in intensively and mapped it in detail. \n\"Our study coincides with the release of a new water allocation plan, so I think the two sets of information work really well together.\" \nMr Hill said similar data was being finalised in other areas of the Northern Territory, including Wadeye, Gunn Point, Ti Tree, Dunmarra and Orange Creek. \nHe said this year the department would look at surveying the Roper Valley and the western Barkly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T08:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T04:10:10.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
