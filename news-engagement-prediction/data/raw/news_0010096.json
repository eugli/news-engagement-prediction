Our Super Adventure \nThe comics show the couple‚Äôs funny banter, their love for their four cats Pesto, Toby, Wilson and Pixel, and of course, their love for each other. \n‚ÄúStef‚Äôs this whole other human being but it totally feels like we‚Äôre just one person!‚Äù she told HuffPost. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so comforting to have someone you can talk to about anything, and he‚Äôs always helping me with my comics. I feel like we‚Äôre this tight little unit and it‚Äôs exciting to be this team together! I feel like we can take on anything.‚Äù", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T07:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T02:38:59.754+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
