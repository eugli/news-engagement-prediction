Let stand for 10 to 15 minutes. It should be slightly foamy. \nAdd the flour, melted butter, and salt and mix until the dough comes together. Knead by hand on a floured surface or with stand mixer and dough hook on medium-low speed for 8 to 10 minutes. Add more flour as needed to keep the dough from sticking to hands, the counter, or bowl. The dough should be firm but still slightly tacky. \nOil a large bowl. Gather the dough into a ball and place in the oiled bowl. Turn to coat all sides with the oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled, about 1 hour. \nLine a large baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat. Or spray the baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray. \nPut 2 to 3 quarts of water in a large saucepan or deep saute pan. Add the baking soda to the water and stir. \nJust before the dough has finished the rising cycle, bring the water and soda mixture to a boil over high. \nHeat the oven to 400Â° F. \nCut the dough into 4 or 5 portions and roll them on a floured surface to make thick ropes. Cut into 1-inch lengths. Place on the parchment paper lined baking sheet. \nUsing a skimmer or similar large slotted spoon, immerse several of the dough pieces in the boiling water and soda mixture. Let them boil for about 10 to 20 seconds, then lift them out and put them back on the parchment paper lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough. \nSprinkle the pieces of dough lightly with the coarse kosher salt or sea salt. \nBake for about 10 minutes, or until they are a deep golden brown color. \nMakes about 4 to 5 dozen, depending on the size. \nServe with plain yellow mustard or a mustard dipping sauce. \nYou Might Also Like", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:55:01.823+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
