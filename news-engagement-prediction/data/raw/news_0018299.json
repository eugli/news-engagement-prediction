Teenager excluded from school for being 'caked in make-up' \nStargazers will be treated to a lunar eclipse, snow moon and New Year comet all at the same time. \nA lot of the UK’s night sky is expected to be blanketed by clouds, so you might have difficulty getting the full experience. \nYou don’t have to be a space nerd to appreciate the rarity of this spectacle, here’s how you can witness tonight’s light show. Lunar eclipse The eclipse may be hard to see in parts of the UK plagued with clouds (Picture: PA) \nStarting around 10.30pm, the sun, moon and earth will all line up. \nThis will cast a strange effect on the surface of the moon, known as a penumbral lunar eclipse. Fears there may be more people trapped in wreckage of lorry that fell off bridge \nParts of the UK will have a clear view of the eclipse from 12.43am to 2.53am. \nBut this will be obscured by clouds the further east and south you live, according to the Met Office. \nForecaster Graham Madge said: ‘The western isles to western Scotland, Northern Ireland and the south west will be particularly clear tonight, but the rest of the UK may struggle to see the eclipse.’ Snow moon The full moon will be brighter than usual this time of year (Picture: Getty) \nThe full moon is known as the Snow Moon because February is the snowiest month. \nNative Americans also refer to it as the Hunger Moon – due to the struggle of some tribes to find food this time of year. \nIt’s due to rise at 4.44pm this evening and will set at 7.30am on Saturday. \nThe clouds will be thickest from 3am to 6am Saturday morning, so you should still have a few windows of opportunity to see it. New Year comet The periodic comet visits every five and a quarter years (Picture: Getty Images) \nComet 45P/Honda-Mrkos-Pajdušáková has actually been tracked for the last several weeks, if you have a telescope handy. Student's headache turned out to be deadly infection from her tampon \nBut it will be visible to the naked eye after midnight where it will be closest to Earth. \nIt will pass by at a distance of 7.4 million miles – that’s 30 times further away than the moon. \nThe periodic comet was first spotted in 1948 and returns every five and a quarter years, and is marked out by a bright purple tail.
