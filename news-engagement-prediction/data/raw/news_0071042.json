It's also Miami's biggest tourist trap and home to the worst restaurant in Miami . Know how to do South Beach without getting played . Pop into the Clevelander for a drink to get the Ocean Drive experience, then spend your dining budget elsewhere. Assuming that people will speak English Well over half of Miami's residents were born outside the United States, a simply staggering proportion. So it's perfectly normal for people here not to understand more than rudimentary English. Your odds are better of winning a $500 scratch ticket than having an English-speaking Uber driver. Your waiter might not understand the phrase \"Is this gluten-free?\" The front-desk clerk at your hotel might give you a blank stare when you ask for more body wash. People will automatically talk to you in Spanish, even if you look like James McAvoy. You can go all Trumpkin and say, \"I thought this was MURICUH. Why don't they learn English??\" but exactly none of that is going to help you find Plan B at Walgreens when not even the manager understands what you're asking for. So either learn some helpful phrases in Spanish before you come here, or just prepare to make due. Miami Metrorail | Shutterstock/Rudy Umans Counting on public transportation. At all. Do we have something here called the Metrorail? Yes. Could 95% of Miamians tell you where it goes? No. Because Miami has about as much sensible urban planning as we do annual snowfall, our big public train is pretty useless unless you're going to Hialeah Park, the airport, or Santa Clara, wherever that is. The buses run whenever they damn well feel like it. Either rent a car or use ride-shares and taxis, but donâ€™t count on public transportation here for anything. Expecting cars to stop at crosswalks Is it the law? Yes. So is not using public funds at strip clubs but, hey, we take a cue from our civic leaders. Miamians have about as much regard for crosswalks and right-of-way as we do for voting regulations. So when crossing the street, even legally, don't ever assume a car will stop or even slow down. You've been warned. South Beach | Shutterstock/bartuchna@yahoo.pl Assuming all of Miami is South Beach LeBron James did us no favors when he told the world he was \"taking his talents to South Beach,\" since the Miami Heat play nowhere near there. TV and the movies have led the world to think all of Miami is this little island called South Beach, when in fact the city of Miami Beach is but a modest fraction of the seventh-largest metro in America. We're more like LA than New York, which means lots of sprawl and traffic between destinations. And if you want to explore all the other great things about this city (which you absolutely should), from the street murals in Wynwood to the culture of Little Havana, understand you're looking at at least a half-hour drive from South Beach. Using weak sunscreen Saying, \"I go all summer at Lake Winnepatonka and only burn, like, once\" is the kind of logic that keeps dermatologists in business. Look at a map: We're a LOT closer to the equator here than any non-Hawaii spot in America, on about the same latitude as most of Mexico. That means the UV here, especially in the summer, will kick your ass. We can spot tourists by their ridiculous sunburns. Go ahead and pack that SPF 45 -- you'll have plenty of tan to prove you were here. Pawn Broker | JUAN FERNANDO AYORA Underestimating your costs The first time a bartender hands you a well vodka and soda and says, \"21,\" you might think she's asking you for ID. Nope. That's the price of your drink. In dollars. Getting a buzz in Miami can run you into triple digits. An entire night of drinking will be more than a car payment. And the concept of a $25 plate of spaghetti is not lost on us either, so if you want to eat in even mid-priced restaurants, budget about $60-$75 per person for dinner. Assuming that hot foreign girl at the club is actually into you She's not. She's into your Rolex, or whatever expensive thing you've been flashing around all night to get her attention, because she will be stealing it from you by the end of the night. This happens alarmingly often to dimwitted males in Miami. Even if those B-girls aren't criminals, they're trying to scam you. Clubs actually employ women to mingle as club patrons, flirt with guys at tables, and get them to buy expensive bottles of Champagne. If you hear the phrase, \"I really LOVE Veuve,\" you know you're being played. Good barometer: If sexy women with foreign accents don't hit on you at home, they're not doing it here. related ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:30:40.750+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
