McGregor's next move is still not set in stone but recent signs indicate a mega-fight against Floyd Mayweather could be edging closer. The potentially lucrative crossover fight would attract interest from both the mixed martial arts and boxing worlds and it seems McGregor's preparations have already begun. McGregor also posted this image recently, adding: 'They doubted me then too' He shared a video of a sparring session in the confines of a boxing ring at Straight Blast Gym in his home city. The Notorious appeared to be sharp and has a background in the sweet science having started in the sport as a youngster. Having comprehensively out-boxed Eddie Alvarez to become lightweight champion in his last fight, McGregor can claim to have some of the most impressive stand-up skills in the UFC. Facing Mayweather would be another level entirely, with the boxer having retired unbeaten as one of the best his sport has known. Having initially reaffirmed his retirement, the 'Money Man' has softened his stance in recent weeks and believes the contest will take place. Should the fight take place, no doubt McGregor could afford to add a few more 'buses' to his fleet.
