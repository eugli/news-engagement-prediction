Hotels.ng , arguably one of Jumia Travel's biggest competitors, has also launched online flight bookings on its platform as it also tries to become a one-stop destination for all things travel. \nOnline flight booking on Hotels.ng (Innovation Village) According to Innovation Village , Mark Essien , CEO at Hotels.ng, describes the move as a means of providing more value for its users, something that could further help it consolidate its already extensive presence.

Now, in addition to booking affordable hotels, they can make affordable flight reservations and bookings on the same Hotels.ng platform that users have come to trust ,\" says Essien, according to an Innovation Village report. “ For us, this new feature reaffirms us as a competitive player in the Nigerian Online Travel Agency (OTA) industry .” \nOmidyar network invests in Hotel.ng (twimg) Like it does Jumia Travel, the online flight booking service will complement Hotels' core offering, further creating a wholesome travel experience for its users. Hotels also launched Spots.ng , a site that shows you interesting places across Nigeria, recently. Coupled with the new flight booking service, Hotels is gradually growing its service offerings to lay claim to the online hospitality mark in Nigeria. We'll keep an eye on its progress.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T14:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T10:14:08.216+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
