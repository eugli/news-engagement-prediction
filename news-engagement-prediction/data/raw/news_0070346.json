Feb 14, 2017 at 9:50am PST \n“Our career is a bit selfish,” the former Mirrorball champion explains. \n“I mean, not in a bad way, but it's always about you and about how you look, how you feel, because of the job requirements.\" \nBut all that’s changed since little Shai came into the world. Feb 15, 2017 at 12:59pm PST \n\"That's the thing that I didn't expect,\" newly minted mommy blogger Peta, 30, says. \n\"I thought before I would be like, 'Oh my god, I can't wait to get back to work. You know, I just want to go and, you know, he'll be fine.'” \nIt seems like the couple’s DWTS return is going to be impossible for Shai’s parents. Feb 14, 2017 at 12:23pm PST \n“I literally don't want to leave the house to go shopping,” the DWTS Season 22 winner continues. \n“I miss him, I miss his face every time I close the door.\" \nAt least this means we may see Baby Chmerkovskiy on Dancing as soon as possible. A post shared by Peta Murgatroyd (@petamurgatroyd) on Feb 16, 2017 at 8:44am PST \n\"I'm gonna be one of those moms that, I think, is gonna be very proud and shows him off, because I show him to everybody,\" the blonde beauty continues. \n\"Every time we meet somebody — 'Have you seen my son?'\" \nWhile there’s no better place for Peta to flaunt her adorable baby than the DWTS ballroom, one thing may stop us from seeing Shai during Season 24 . \nThe Dancing duo is praying their son doesn’t take up dancing. \nWhen asked earlier this month when Shai will join the family business, his dad replied, “I hope never.” \nDo you think Peta and Maks will bring their baby to DWTS 24? Tell us in the comments section below! \nDancing With the Stars returns Monday, March 20, at 8 p.m. ET on ABC. \nCheck out more of Wetpaint ’s coverage of Dancing With the Stars below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:32:42.494+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
