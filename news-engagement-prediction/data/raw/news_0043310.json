But the case was rejected and she was forced to give birth.\nHowever, in 1973 her appeal made it to the US Supreme Court where, by a vote of seven to two, the justices ruled that the government lacked the power to prohibit abortions.\n'Men making decisions about women's bodies'\nRoe v Wade explained\nThe court's judgement was based on the decision that a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy came under the freedom of personal choice in family matters, as protected by the Constitution.\nThe case for abortion Why one woman decided to terminate her pregnancy - and defends Planned Parenthood The case against Jeanne Mancini organises March for Life, a major anti-abortion rally in the US Read more : The last big US abortion ruling\nMcCorvey, having revealed her real name in the 1980s, went on to clarify that she had not been raped as she had earlier claimed. She had said so only to get permission for an abortion and speed up her case.\nBy the time the legal challenges to her case were over, her daughter was two and had been given away for adoption.\n\"I'm a simple woman with a ninth-grade education who wants women not to be harassed or condemned,\" she told the New York Times in 1994, before she went on to denounce abortion. \"It's no glamorous thing to go through an abortion. I never had one, but I've worked in three clinics and I know.\"\nIn an anti-abortion television advert broadcast earlier this decade, she said: \"Abortion has eliminated 50 million innocent babies in the US alone since 1973. Abortion scars an untold number of post-abortive mothers, fathers, and families too.\"\nBefore Roe v Wade, some states had already started to reform or repeal laws on abortion, but women seeking a termination had to do so illegally, at great expense, and often in unsafe conditions.\nOne underground network run by women in Chicago said it performed some 12,000 abortions in the late 1960s and early 70s, before the court ruling was made.\nIn more recent years, the issue has proven to be among the most divisive in US politics.\nAmy has to travel eight hours for an abortion Last month, President Trump signed an executive order banning federal money going to international groups which perform or provide information on abortions.\nThe order, known as the Mexico City Policy, was originally put in place by Ronald Reagan but was rescinded under Bill Clinton.\nUS anti-abortion activists rally in DC\nAlthough the policy does not directly affect services in the US, Mr Trump has said he supports an abortion ban at home, where several states maintain restrictions on abortion services.\nIn many parts of America, women have to travel for hours to get an abortion because access to services is limited.\nDonald Trump shifts again on abortion", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38729364", "http://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/28/garden/at-home-with-norma-mccorvey-of-roe-dreams-and-choices.html?pagewanted=all", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/49315.stm", "http://www.fwhc.org/jane.htm", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/FE1C/production/_94725056_mediaitem94725055.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-36641063"], "published": "2017-02-18T23:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T02:41:29.145+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
