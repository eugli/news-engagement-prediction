No-one has the right to make me feel the pain I had to endure. \n“I now have scars which will always be a reminder of this horrific assault. \n“The attack keeps flashing back in my mind. This is really unfair what I have had to suffer and I still have a long way to go to recover. \n“This was unprovoked and the result has changed my life massively.” \nMr Newbold had been out in the city centre drinking with friends on August 21 last year. \nAround midnight he walked up Northumberland Street, intending to take some money out to go to catch a taxi at the Haymarket. ncjMedia 5 Following the attack outside the bank blood was left spattered on the floor where Mr Newbold was “gutted” \nAngus Taylor, prosecuting, said: “In the vicinity of the cashpoint he was approached by two beggars, Jones and a female. \n“Jones asked the injured party for some money, the injured party declined and Jones became aggressive and demanded a fight. \n“At this point the other men appeared, one of whom was Kelly. \n“Threatening words were said to have been exchanged before the attack took place. \n“The complainant describes the attack as a blur. He recalls being punched by one man to his left eye socket which caused him pain and he fell to his knees. \n“He felt a knife slash his arm and felt multiple stabs to his abdomen. \n“He was curled in a ball in a defensive position to try to protect himself and there was a barrage of punches and kicks to his whole body during the sustained attack. \n“He could feel pain at the time of the attack and what he feared most was the impact these blows could have on his internal organs.” ncjMedia Newcastle Crown Court heard the victim suffered “life-changing injuries”, including three stab wounds to his abdomen \nThe attackers eventually dispersed, stealing Mr Newbold’s bag and bank card. \nMr Taylor said: “Fearing for his safety he sought refuge in a nearby takeaway. \n“He was drifting in and out of consciousness and bleeding profusely.” \nAn ambulance was called and Mr Newbold was taken to hospital, where he was found to have a stab wound to his upper abdomen, two to his lower abdomen, two to his right hand and one to his right arm. \nMr Taylor said: “The injuries have been life-changing. There is permanent scarring and he is scared to go out at night.” \nAround 25 minutes after the attack, Kelly, along with two other men, went to a nearby Mcdonald’s and tried to use the stolen card to pay for food but it was rejected. \nJones, 26, of Saltwell Place, Gateshead, admitted wounding with intent and was locked up for 12-and-a-half years while Kelly, 23, of no fixed address, admitted handling stolen goods and got 14 months. \nRecorder Darren Preston said: “He was lucky to have escaped without even more permanent damage than he has, or even death. \n”This was a city centre, where people should feel safe to go about their business.” \nNick Cartmell, for Jones, said: “He is truly sorry. \n“It was a hot summer’s night, a good night for begging and he and his girlfriend were at the cashpoint and there was an argument. \n“It was a joint attack, he was not the initial stabber and he was not responsible for all of the injuries. \n“The man was gutted in this case but the defendant did not appreciate how serious the injuries they caused were. \n“He reflects back on this as a night of horror at what he has done. It was a horrendous attack on an innocent member of the public using the cashpoint.” \nScott Smith, for Kelly, said he was taking legal highs at the time and was not involved in the stabbing. \nWe pay for your stories!
