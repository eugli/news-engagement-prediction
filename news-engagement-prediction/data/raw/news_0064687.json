They were super-thick by comparison to mine, and would probably hit just short of his brow if he ever curled them. Of course, he hated when I'd say that, but I'd always retort with something stupid like, \"That's male privilege! Those long eyelashes you don't even need!\" Every time one of my lashes would fall out, I'd I've tried various lash serums in an attempt to reach similar lengths, and to be fair, they all work pretty well if you just have to remember to apply them every night, but the Revitalash Advanced ($98; nordstrom.com ) formula was the one that made the biggest difference on my own set.

Since I've been at my desired length for a hot minute, I apply the product every other day just to keep the new growth in check. I still get asked occasionally if they're extensions, in which case I stay singing the serum's praises to the tune of whichever embarrassing song happened to be on my daily playlist. Where my genetics fail me, Revitalash is picking up the slack. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T21:01:00.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
