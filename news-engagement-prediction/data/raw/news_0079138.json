Save Ricoh \nRicoh makes one of the best, simple 360-degree cameras out there. It's gradually added better picture quality , more video skills (and cheaper models) to its Theta series , but the company's taking its tech in a different direction with a spherical video camera capable of live streaming 2K at 30fps. The stitching takes place in real-time and the product is unmistakably for creators and media types. This is the Ricoh R Developer kit, and you can preorder one now . \nThe camera outputs video through either HDMI or USB, and it'll need constant AC power adapter to continuously livestream up to 24 hours of footage. The camera records onto a micro SD card to help reduce the size of the device, which is almost the same size as its Theta predecessors, although if you're recording 2K spherical video, we'd advise a very high-capacity card. \nRicoh is launching the compact camera with a 24-hour broadcast from MWC in Barcelona, and says it'll be offering a Hololens stream too, if you're a rare Hololens owner. You can watch the 360-degree livestream here , while those tempted by the camera itself can preorder today: the camera is set to arrive this spring.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T17:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T12:13:18.685+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
