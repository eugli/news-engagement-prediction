Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nGrief-stricken Helen Bailey revealed her fears over her new life with fiancé Ian Stewart in a chilling interview months before her murder. \nSpeaking about how she dealt with the death of her husband John Sinfield who drowned in the sea in Barbados in 2011, the author confessed how \"different\" her life was without him. \nRecalling an incident she included in a memoir about the bereavement, Helen said she wanted John to \"just come back and rescue her\". \nShe told Cambridge News : \"We'd been out to dinner at someone's house, and we were walking back along the road, and the sky was inky black, and I suddenly realised that I didn't know any of these people a few years ago. \n\"I didn't know Ian, I didn't know the people we'd been to dinner with, I'd never heard of Royston. And for this split moment, the grief just…\" \n\"I thought 'John, just come back and rescue me. Just come back. The big experiment's over now'. And I felt so alone, so isolated, like I'd been picked up and plonked there. And then it was OK.\" \nStewart, 56, was found guilty of murdering Helen and dumping her in a cesspit underneath her £1.2m home in a calculated plot to inherit her millions.
