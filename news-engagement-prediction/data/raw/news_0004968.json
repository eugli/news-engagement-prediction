This first ever decline in sign-ups follows the new administration’s cancelling of millions of dollars worth of advertising. \nIn the final days of Obamacare open enrollment, President Trump not only pulled advertising and stopped outreach efforts reminding Americans of the deadline to enroll, the president also signed an executive order weakening enforcement of the individual mandate.

That figure will not be released until March. \nThe Obama administration signed a nearly $75 million contract with a private advertising firm to promote open enrollment through Healthcare.gov. The final four to five million dollars of television and radio ads were pulled by the Trump administration in January. \nBefore the funds were pulled in December, the CMS said a record 6.4 million customers signed up, an increase of 400,000 from the previous year. On December 15, they also reported the largest day for open enrollment ever on HealthCare.gov, with 670,000 plans selected. \nSince then, sign-ups declined from 686,708 people in the final week of open enrollment in 2015 to 376,260 people in the final two weeks in 2016. \nThe number of “window shopping” users, or unique visits to the site, also dropped significantly from 1,305,998 in the last week of open enrollment in 2015 to 406,327 in the last two weeks of open enrollment in 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T12:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T07:43:43.761+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
