Experts at the Networked Quantum Information Technologies Hub (NQIT), based at Oxford University, believe our next great technological leap lies in the development of quantum computing. More reliable way to produce single photons November 24, 2016 \nPhysicists at the University of Bath have developed a technique to more reliably produce single photons that can be imprinted with quantum information. Precise quantum cloning: Possible pathway to secure communication October 26, 2016 \nPhysicists at The Australian National University (ANU) and University of Queensland (UQ) have produced near-perfect clones of quantum information using a new method to surpass previous cloning limits. Not 1, not 2, not 3, but 4 clones! November 4, 2011 \nXi-Jun Ren and Yang Xiang from Henan Universities in China, in collaboration with Heng Fan at the Institute of Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, have produced a theory for a quantum cloning machine able to produce ... Researchers make leap in measuring quantum states July 21, 2016 \nA breakthrough into the full characterisation of quantum states has been published today as a prestigious Editors' Suggestion in the journal Physical Review Letters. Quantum computing advances with control of entanglement September 27, 2016 \nWhen the quantum computer was imagined 30 years ago, it was revered for its potential to quickly and accurately complete practical tasks often considered impossible for mere humans and for conventional computers. But, there ... Recommended for you Protecting quantum computing networks against hacking threats February 3, 2017 \nAs we saw during the 2016 US election, protecting traditional computer systems, which use zeros and ones, from hackers is not a perfect science. Now consider the complex world of quantum computing, where bits of information ... Looking for entangled atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate February 3, 2017 \nUsing a Bose-Einstein condensate composed of millions of sodium atoms, researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have observed a sharp magnetically-induced quantum phase transition where they expect to find entangled ... Quantum RAM: Modelling the big questions with the very small February 3, 2017 \nWhen it comes to studying transportation systems, stock markets and the weather, quantum mechanics is probably the last thing to come to mind. However, scientists at Australia's Griffith University and Singapore's Nanyang ... Combining pulsed laser with electron gun allows for capturing fast motion of nanoparticles in a liquid February 3, 2017 \n(Phys.org)â€”A team of researchers at the California Institute of Technology has combined a pulsed laser with an electron gun to capture imagery of suspended nanoparticles moving at nanosecond speeds. In their paper published ... Researchers investigate the potential of metal grids for future electronic components February 3, 2017 \nScientists from the Helmholtz Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) have shown how a cobalt grid can be reliably programmed at room temperature. In addition, they have discovered that for every hole (\"antidot\"), three magnetic ... Search smarter not harder: Physicists present optimal strategy for foragers February 3, 2017 \nAn engineer constructing wells in oil fields and an animal foraging for scarce food in the desert often face a similar dilemma: How long should they look for more of their needed resource before they move on to look elsewhere? ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T05:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T00:25:11.728+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
