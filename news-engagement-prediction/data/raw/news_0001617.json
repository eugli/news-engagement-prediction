It took Kellie Leitch, whose focus on immigration reform has also elicited comparisons to Trump, three months to raise that much. \nREAD MORE: Kevin O’Leary says his high profile in US makes him perfect candidate to lead Canada \nThe debate is being moderated by Rob Moore, a former Tory MP who serves as the federal party’s shadow critic for Atlantic issues despite losing his House of Commons seat in 2015, when the Conservatives were wiped out in eastern Canada. \nRebuilding the party’s support there is seen as crucial for the party. Two leadership candidates — Erin O’Toole and Lisa Raitt — have both played up their East Coast roots in launching their respective leadership bids. \nRaitt has also been one of the most outspoken critics of O’Leary’s decision to join the race. \nWell before he officially declared himself in the race, she launched a website specifically to highlight what she considers reasons he’s wrong for the party and for the country. \nRaitt has also come out strongly against Leitch, whose contentious policy of screening immigrants for “Canadian values” was back in the news this past week. A banner listing the names of the Quebec mosque victims was draped over her constituency office with a call for her to resign. © 2017 The Canadian Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T19:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T14:38:37.886+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
