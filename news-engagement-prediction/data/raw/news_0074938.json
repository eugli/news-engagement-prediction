You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast . \nEvery three seconds, another Billy bookcase rolls off the production line of the Gyllensvaans Mobler factory in Kattilstorp, a tiny village in southern Sweden. \nThe factory's couple of hundred employees never actually touch a bookshelf - their job is to tend to the machines, imported from Germany and Japan, which work constantly, to cut, glue, drill and pack the various component parts of the Billy bookcase. Image copyright AP Image caption Gyllensvaans Mobler has been making Billy bookcases since 1952 \nIn goes particle board by the lorry load, 600 tonnes a day, and out come ready-boxed products, stacked six-by-three on pallets and ready for the lorries. \nFramed on the wall in the factory's reception is a typewritten letter - the company's very first furniture-making order from Ikea in 1952. Image copyright Gyllensvaans Mobler \nIkea was not, back then, the global behemoth of today, with stores in dozens of countries and turnover in the tens of billions. \nIts founder, Ingvar Kamprad, was just 17 when he started the business with a small gift of cash from his father, a reward for trying hard at school despite dyslexia. Light bulb moment \nBy 1952, aged 26, Ingvar already had a 100-page furniture catalogue, but had not yet hit on the idea of flat-packing. \nThat came a few years later, as he and his company's fourth employee - Gillis Lundgren - were packing a car with furniture for a catalogue photo shoot. \n\"This table takes up too much darn space,\" Gillis said. \"We should unscrew the legs.\" Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ikea founder Ingvar Kamprad is believed to be the world's eighth richest man \nIt was a light bulb moment. \nKamprad was already obsessed with cutting prices - so obsessed, some manufacturers had started to boycott him. One way keep prices low is to sell furniture in bits, rather than paying labourers to assemble it. \nEven bigger savings come from precisely the problem that inspired Gillis Lundgren: transport. Constant tweaks \nIn 2010, for example, Ikea rethought the design of its Ektorp sofa and made the armrests detachable. \nThat helped halve the size of the packaging, which halved the number of lorries needed to get the sofas from factory to warehouse, and warehouse to shop. And that lopped a seventh off the price. \nConsider another Ikea icon: the Bang mug. \nYou have probably had a drink from one - with yearly sales reaching 25 million, there are plenty knocking around. \nIts design is distinctive - wide at the top, tapering downwards with a small handle, right by the rim - and is not motivated purely by aesthetics. Image copyright Ikea Image caption Ikea has continually modified the design and production of its Bang mug to keep costs down \nIkea changed the height of the mug when it realised it could make slightly better use of the space in its supplier's kiln, in Romania. \nAnd tweaking the handle design made them stack more compactly - more than doubling the number you could fit on a pallet, more than halving the cost of getting them from the kiln in Romania to the shelves in the shop. \nIt has been a similar story with the Billy bookcase. \nIt does not look like it has changed much since 1978, yet it costs 30% less. That is partly due to constant, tiny tweaks in both product and production method. \nBut it is also thanks to sheer economies of scale. Image copyright Matei Plesa / Gyllensvaans Mobler \nLook at Gyllensvaans Mobler: compared to the 1980s, it is making 37 times as many bookcases, yet its number of employees has only doubled. Of course, that is thanks to all those German and Japanese robots. \nYet a business needs confidence to sink so much money into machinery, especially when it has no other client: pretty much all Gyllensvaans Mobler does is make bookcases for Ikea.
