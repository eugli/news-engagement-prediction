Deliveries of the automobile should start in 2018. You will need a pilot’s license in order to get it up in the air, and the highway is not considering an acceptable take-off or landing site. \nOn the road, the three-wheeler can hit speeds of up to 100 mph and can go 817 miles on a tank of fuel, while the propeller and tail blades are tucked tightly in. \nThen, when you’re sick of the road, it takes just 10 minutes for the propeller and tail blades to expand, turning the automobile into a gyrocopter. \nThe Liberty can then hit 112 mph in the sky and can travel up to 310 miles on a tank of fuel. \n“After years of hard work, beating the technical and qualification challenges, our team succeeded in creating an innovative flying car that complies with existing safety standards, determined by regulatory bodies around the world,” said PAL-V CEO Robert Dingemanse in a statement. \nThe Liberty “Sport” base model starts at $400,000, while the “Pioneer,” equipped with features such as power heating and at-home flying lessons, is going for $600,000. \nYou will have to pay a $10,000 or $25,000 non-refundable deposit on the Sport or Pioneer models respectively. You can also pay PAL-V a $2,500 refundable deposit to be put on a waiting list.
