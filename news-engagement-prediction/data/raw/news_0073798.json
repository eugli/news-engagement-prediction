(Cassandra Mino)\nRegrowing grassroots Wightman, who's also the president of the Ontario Luge Association , said there used to be more of a grassroots luge scene in Eastern Canada when the only Olympic-quality track for the country's lugers was in Lake Placid, N.Y.\nBut when Calgary hosted the Olympics and built a luge track, he said it shifted the focus west. The 2010 Olympic track in Whistler solidified the sport there, and it fizzled out further east.\n\"That's what we're trying to do today is getting luge back in the east, getting kids on sleds and getting a sense of what luge is all about,\" he said, adding it's the first \"learn to luge\" program he can think of in the capital region in about 25 years.\nSylvain Mino (left) and Chris Wightman watch the lessons happening at one of the Edelweiss ski resort's tubing hills, which they rented for the day. (Andrew Foote/CBC)\nBoth Mino and Wightman said they'd like to do a March Break luge camp at Edelweiss, weather permitting, and keep these events going next winter.\n\"Kids love tobogganing, this is a natural extension of that,\" Wightman said.\n\"Instead of going straight down a hill you're learning how to turn the sleds, control it, find fast lines through a course. It's great to give kids and opportunity to try a sport that's a natural Canadian sport.\"", "external_links": ["https://t.co/zkWe3cEb2b", "https://t.co/rEQmcEFJ5U", "http://ontarioluge.ca/", "https://twitter.com/amkfoote/status/835936859259817984"], "published": "2017-02-27T01:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T04:04:47.588+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
