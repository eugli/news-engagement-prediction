(Because, you know, heaven forbid that they actually hear what people think about this grand plan for slashing healthcare benefits for millions of the neediest Americans.) \nChuck Grassley, Iowa's senior senator and charter member of Politician Twitter Hall of Fame, was undeterred by the angry protests confronted by the likes of unapologetic coward Jason Chaffetz , hosting a standing room-only crowd in an Iowa Falls community center bright and early on Tuesday morning. Politico reports on the righteous owns that ensued. \nChris Petersen, a pig farmer from outside of Clear Lake, Iowa, who worries about losing the health coverage he gets under Obamacare, showed up at the Iowa Falls community center with a gift for Grassley: Extra Strength Tums. \n“You’re going to need them in the next few years,” said Petersen, 62, a self-described progressive Democrat with insulin-dependent diabetes. “People are disappointed.” \nDang, Chris. This is entirely fair, though—Grassley was responsible for the insane \"pull the plug on grandma\" rhetoric that started the even- more -delusional \"death panel\" hysteria that got people so angry during those contentious anti -Care Act town halls back in 2009. Life comes at you fast, senator. \nhttps://twitter.com/BraddJaffy/status/834103479199203330 \nI'm not even sure Tums can help with that burn. (Sorry.) \nThings did not improve for Grassley . He did have a bright spot, though, when responding to a young man who sounds like he needs to spend much less time surfing Breitbart before attending his next town hall: \nThe only question that surprised him, he said afterward, was from a cherubic young boy with curly blond hair. He wanted to know why refugees get free health care in the United States when veterans and the elderly don’t. Grassley gently disagreed with his premise, pointing out the federal government’s Veterans Administration, Medicare and Medicaid programs. EDITOR’S PICK Paul Ryan's Obamacare Alternative Is Here, and It Doesn't Even Pretend to Care About Poor People \nIt's tempting to laud Grassley for having the guts to show up, but that instinct shows just how much Republicans have moved the bar here. Their blithe refusal to listen to their constituents is laughably chickenhearted, but the rationale that many of them have offered for doing so—that the attendees are \"paid protestors\" who are just there to cause a scene —is even more insidious. A distant cousin of President Trump responding to fact-based questions by screaming \"FAKE NEWS\" on Twitter, this line of argument allows lawmakers to duck their responsibility as elected officials (and functioning adults) to make coherent policy arguments in support of their positions. By showing his face in his home state, Grassley isn't showing courage , really—he's just doing his job. If only more of his colleagues felt like doing the same.
