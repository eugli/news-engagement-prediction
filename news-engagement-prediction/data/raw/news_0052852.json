The biopic stars Nawazuddin Siddiqui in the lead role of the celebrated writer, Saadat Hasan Manto. \nNandita says apart from the Raees actor, prominent names from the industry will be joining the project. “The work is going on in full swing. We are going on floors from March 15, so there’s a lot of work. It’s a very big project for me. It’s a period film, we will recreate 1940s here,” she told reporters.

They are ready to do even small roles, all of the names will be out soon. I hope you’ll watch the film.” \nThe filmmaker says the team is aiming to wrap up the shoot of the film soon as they don’t have the budget of a big Bollywood movie. “It is an independent film, not a typical Bollywood song and dance film. We don’t have a big budget so we can’t stretch it (the shooting) till 200 days. We will try to shoot it as fast as we can, in a very efficient way.” Read more Roadies: Has Nikhil Chinapa replaced Karan Kundrra for slapping a contestant? \nNandita, however, did not reveal who has replaced Om Puri in the film, as the actor passed away earlier this year, before starting the film.

Mental illness is like any other illness. There are other cures. In our society we don’t even have the right vocabulary. We don’t even know how to deal with it. Either it is hushed or there is a discomfort. We just don’t have conversations about it. We need to have more compassion. I don’t know what mental illness is... I feel we all have some kind of mental illness. Some express it more openly, some don’t.” tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T04:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:13:04.761+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
