Not repealing the Act when Congress had absolute majority in the Lok Sabha was “one of the biggest regrets”, he said, adding that scrapping of the AFSPA will send a positive message across the northeastern states. “You can build hundreds of kilometres of roads, you can build hydro electric projects, electrify all villages, (but) nothing is equal to repeal of AFSPA,” the former Union Home Minister said at an Asia Society event here.\n“AFSPA is a draconian, inhuman law but we couldn’t repeal it. Why? Because the Congress, in many ways, is as contradicting as Parliament is, as our polity is. There are as many views in the Congress as there are in polity or as in Parliament.\n“There is an amendment lying at the table of the prime minister and home minister but why is this government with 282 members of its own in Lok Sabha unwilling to repeal AFSPA? I think they believe that AFSPA is necessary. They believe that AFSPA is desirable and given a chance they will make it more stringent,” Chidambaram said.\nYou May Also Want To Watch:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T08:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:09:08.579+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
