Follow him here . Feb 19, 2017 Tweet Media via Twitter Aaron Gordon was the runaway favorite in the 2017 NBA All-Star Dunk Contest, and the Orlando Magic forward blew his golden opportunity. After losing in heartbreaking fashion to Minnesota's Zach LaVine last year, Gordon bombed out in the first round of the competition, making way for Pacers forward Glenn Robinson III to take home the crown. It was a war of attrition more than anything. The 2017 Dunk Contest was plagued with bad misses, high-wire acts that misfired, and barely-made dunks that wouldn't cut it in a D-League competition, let alone in the main event. Robinson III sprinkled in a couple of flashy finishes, but it wasn't quite enough to make up for a listless night overall. We missed you, Zach LaVine.

But there was a bit of trouble with the execution, and—perhaps in a bit of pay-for-play shenanigans—Gordon got a fourth chance to complete the dunk. \nThe world's first official \" SlamDrone \".

The judges responded accordingly, handing Gordon the lowest score of the opening round with a 38. Social media wasn't too crazy about it either: \nTHE ROBOTS HAVE TURNED ON US! — Matt Dollinger ( @matt_dollinger ) February 19, 2017 \nI'll be honest, I did not expect to hear the phrase \"reload the drone\" during a dunk contest. — Brian Grubb ( @briancgrubb ) February 19, 2017 \n2017: the NBA dunk contest as dystopian future filled with surveillance drones and DJ Khaled as America's most complete artist. — Otto Von Biz Markie ( @Passionweiss ) February 19, 2017 Second Round Gordon failed to complete his second attempt, leaving fans wondering what might have been if he had shown up to the competition healthy. The other big name was just as forgetful; Jordan's second dunk was technically impressive, but the finish left a lot to be desired: — NBA on TNT ( @NBAonTNT ) February 19, 2017 Thankfully, Jones Jr. woke the crowd up from its slumber with some assistance from Suns teammate Devin Booker.
