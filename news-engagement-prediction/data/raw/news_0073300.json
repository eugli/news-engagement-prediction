Flying into Park City, Utah, for the Sundance Film Festival, the actress ditched the standby of winter tights in favor of black knee socks. Peeking out from under a floral miniskirt, what could have read “prim schoolmarm” instead spelled quirky chic. Sevigny added a fresh mix of prints to the equation—a red argyle cardigan layered under a navy and red windowpane-plaid overcoat—to give the look bite. Striking a smart balance between coquettish and cool, the trick to successfully styling knee socks is, as Vogue.com Market Editor Chelsea Zalopany attests, about avoiding the matronly (“Like that, ‘You didn’t mean for your hosiery to show but they slid down your leg’ vibe.”) as well as the overly girlish, i.e., “like you’re trying to do Catholic schoolgirl.” They’re a welcome lift out of the inevitable mid-season wardrobe rut. Ready for an alternative to the winter tight? Slip on Falke's silken pair for a soft, luxurious finish or The Elder Statesman's glitter socks to bring a little punch to winter dressing—certainly a leg up on the old thermal.
