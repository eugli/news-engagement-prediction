(Kate Letterick/CBC)\nDallaire said a staff report will be provided to council within a week, and Arnold said a decision on the loan will be made then.\n\"While we admire what he's doing and admire what the group is doing we also have to ensure that it is ... in the best interest of Monctonians,\" Arnold said.\n\"We have to be able to, if something goes wrong, be able to get that money back. And at this time, that's all a bit murky and so we have to get that clarified.\"\nBurrell thanked everyone on city council who was supporting his group, saying their open mind to create change would benefit all citizens. But he had another message for those who \"stand against us.\"\n\"You don't have to worry about us making you look bad because you're just going to do that to yourself,\" Burrell said.\n\"If you still don't understand the issues surrounding poverty in our community, and the progress that has been made, then I'm done wasting my time.
