But turns out the Hammers boss is a really nice bloke. \nAs a player Bilic was as no nonsense, tough tackling and scary a centre back as a striker would want to come up against. He took no guff from nobody and you imagine, just by seeing him on the sidelines that's exactly what he's like as a manager too. \nFor most of the season his mood would not have been good due to problems with the London Stadium, the Hammers' form and the fact he's had to deal with Dimitri Payet's mood until the Frenchman left for Marseille. \nHowever that hasn't stopped him being an utter hero to one young fan. Matt Hill's son Alf waited after training to see all of his footballing idols but when the youngster was left gutted by Andy Carroll staying behind to do extra fitness work the West Ham boss made sure Alf didn't leave without meeting Carroll first. @davidgold what a man you have in charge. His act of kindness should be recognised for what he did for my son yesterday. #WHUFC #SUPERSLAV pic.twitter.com/s7X4KVMuRx - Matt Hill (@matthill_33) February 15, 2017 \nClearly young Alf was very chuffed at getting to meet the England international: @WestHamUtd what a man you have in charge. His act of kindness should be recognised for what he did for my son yesterday. #WHUFC #SUPERSLAV pic.twitter.com/cx02brYc75 - Matt Hill (@matthill_33) February 15, 2017 \nCheck out our video of how West Ham fans feel about former hero Payet now: \nIt's easy to lose sight of what meeting the players can meet to fans, especially young ones and it's incredible work from Bilic to allow the kid to go and see Carroll especially when he's doing extra fitness work to be ready for their next match. \nSince returning to the team the former Newcastle United forward has been on absolute fire scoring four in four. \nWhich player would you most like to meet?
