Tourism is a $21 billion industry here but the state has never had a large scale Disney (NYSE: DIS), Universal Studios or Six Flags (NYSE: SIX) theme park. That has prompted several development plans never fulfilled in and around the Phoenix area and near the Grand Canyon. There are new plans to try to bring a big amusement park to Arizona in the style of… more Paul Hiffmeyer Now, a Florida group called The Block Sports Co. has submitted plans with the city of Casa Grande for a potential 618 acre entertainment, resort and commercial development called Dreamport Villages. Block Sports is not affiliated the Walt Disney Co. or Six Flags. Plans call for an Arizona Extreme Sports Park, resort, indoor water park and retail complex. The former would include zip lines, rock climbing, go karts and wakeboarding. There have been some past indoor water parks proposed in the Phoenix area. The only attraction that comes anywhere close to what The Block Sports Co. aims to create is the OdySea in the Desert attraction near Scottsdale, where there are plans to create a complete theme park-style attraction . Florida businessman Ron Segall is listed at the owner of the Block Sports Co. The Florida group is under contract to buy the Pinal County land, according to city records posted by Pinal Central. “The owner intends to develop a comprehensive Destination Resort best compared to that of the Disney World Resort in Orlando Florida,” according to plans submitted with Casa Grande. Casa Grande is an hour south of Phoenix, where there has been plenty of development going on as of late: Tesla competitor Lucid Motors is bringing about 2,000 jobs and a $700 million auto plant and Danrick Builders is working on Attesa, a 2,360-acre motorsports center there — though the latter has no investors as of yet. Those same development plans project four million visitors annually for the first phase of Dreamport Villages. Pinal Central was one of the first to go with the story and it has been latched onto by other Arizona media including KPNX-TV , KNXV-TV and KTAR.com.
