'Unfairly treated' \nIbori, a former London DIY store cashier, was jailed for fraud totalling nearly £50m in April 2012. \nBut now the tables have been turned with Ibori claiming the British authorities were themselves corrupt. \n\"I have been unfairly treated, that's all I can say,\" Mr Ibori told the BBC, confirming that he plans to appeal against his conviction for money laundering. \n\"Yes, I am, of course. I have made that decision personally and I have instructed my solicitors.\" Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Ibori was extradited from Nigeria to London in 2010 \nIbori was believed to have laundered large sums in the UK, just part of hundreds of millions of dollars it was claimed he had embezzled from the Nigerian people. \nOn a state salary of just £4,000 a year he had bought a fleet of luxury cars and expensive properties. He was also looking to buy a private jet. \nIn 2005 the Department for International Development funded a special police unit inside Scotland Yard to go after corrupt African politicians. \nIts prime target was Ibori. Its aim: to get him into a British court and convict him for corruption. Police bribery claims \nHaving been extradited to London in 2010, Ibori was convicted and sentenced to 13 years for money laundering two years later. \nBut since he was jailed, documents have emerged suggesting that at least one officer involved in the Ibori investigation had taken thousands of pounds in bribes. \nLast year, after repeatedly telling judges there was no evidence of police corruption, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) admitted they had found substantial material that supported the allegations. \nLast summer, defence lawyers learned more about an undercover Scotland Yard investigation called Operation Limonium. \n\"There exists intelligence that supports the assertion that [a police officer] received payment in return for information in respect of the Ibori case,\" the CPS admitted. \nThe officer in question has always denied taking bribes and internal police investigations have previously exonerated him. \nDetails of how Scotland Yard tapped phones and conducted covert surveillance on a number of officers in the unit investigating Ibori emerged for the first time. Image copyright Metropolitan Police Image caption Ibori bought expensive properties and cars, including this Bentley, on a salary of £4,000 a year \nOther documents alleging officers had taken bribes were sent to the authorities anonymously in 2011 by a lawyer convicted as part of the Ibori case. \nFormer solicitor Bhadresh Gohil says he was trying to alert them to the police corruption. \n\"I brought this case to the attention of the Met police, the commissioner of the Met police Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, I brought it to the attention of Alison Saunders, the head of the CPS. I also drew it to the attention of the then Home Secretary Theresa May,\" Mr Gohil says. \n\"Unfortunately, no-one did anything about this.\" \nWhat they did do was attempt to prosecute Mr Gohil for perverting the course of justice by faking the documents. With the CPS release of the new documents, that case collapsed. \nThe British authorities managed to get their man before a judge in 2012, but now James Ibori is willingly returning to the courts looking to put the reputation of the UK's criminal justice system on trial. \nThe irony will not be lost on government ministers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T04:34:20.620+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
