And that's the right to life.\n\"Regardless of how you feel about what they're doing, we're talking about our fellow human beings here.\"\nIn recent weeks, dozens of would-be refugee claimants have crossed the Canada-U.S. border by foot in parts of Quebec and Manitoba, often in brutal, freezing weather conditions. The influx is believed to be inspired in part by U.S. President Donald Trump's tough stance on illegal immigration and his controversial travel ban .\nWhile community organizations and municipal officials have helped these would-be claimants once they've reached Canadian border towns, their treks have at times been treacherous.\nTwo Ghanaian men who made the journey through snowy fields in -18 C on Christmas Eve near the town of Emerson, Man., suffered severe frostbite and both lost fingers.\n'Find out where people are crossing' Contacted by CBC News, Yost said citizens in Canada could also provide help to asylum seekers before they reach the nearest community.\n\"I would definitely get supplies together, get citizens together, find out where people are crossing, find out what an appropriate amount of supplies would be,\" Yost said.\nThe Border Angels drop off plastic containers of water, along with warm clothing, emergency blankets, hand warmers and cans of food for those who, once they cross the U.S.-Mexico border in south central California, make the dangerous journey though the rocky desert terrain.\nThey can face life-threatening heat exposure during the summer and freezing temperatures in the fall and winter. According to statistics from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, nearly 7,000 people have died crossing the southwest border between 1998 and 2016.\n\"I'd put out as many supplies as you can,\" Yost said in a telephone interview with CBC News. \"It will save lives and if it doesn't save lives, it will prevent severe discomfort, discomfort that a lot of people have never experienced in their lives.\"\nHe said supplies should be easily identifiable by some kind of flag or notification marker.\n\"What would you want to receive when you're out there?\" Yost said. \"Would you want somebody to come out and help you and really make the difference between life and death for you?\"\nThe Border Angels cover an area more than 50 kilometres wide in the Jacumba Wilderness, dropping their supples in the mountainous desert area just south of the town of Ocotillo, Calif.\n\"Our goal is to find the most high-traffic, dangerous routes to put our supplies along,\" Yost said.\n'Desperate journey: How one man snuck across the U.S.-Canada border Frostbitten refugee will lose fingers, toe after 7-hour trek The supply drop locations are based on information they receive from those who have already crossed the border. As well, members will hike through areas looking for signs of activity, including discarded clothing or water bottles.\nThey also use Google Earth to examine the general area where they believe people are crossing.\nConsumption rates vary\nHe said the supply consumption rates vary and it really depends on the route, as well as the timing weather wise and the political climate. For example, a spike in political rhetoric against illegal immigrants and calls for tougher measures often prompts an influx of people crossing the border into the U.S.\nSupplies have been sabotaged many times, he said, presumably by those opposed to people entering the country illegally.\n\"We find slashed jugs pretty often, just gutted with knives.\"\nThere is nothing illegal about the activities of the Border Angels, he said, and the group has a good working relationship with U.S. border patrol agents. Yost said he makes their job easier by letting them know they are out with volunteers, dropping off water.\nEnrique Morones of the group Border Angels is seen here near the Mexican border in Jacumba, Calif.
