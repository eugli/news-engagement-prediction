WaPo notes man who left CIA over Trump donated thousands to Hillary, Dems Posted at 5:20 pm on February 23, 2017 by Brett T. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nThe Washington Post painted a target on itself earlier this week when it rolled out its new motto , “Democracy Dies in Darkness,” and the people of Twitter immediately got to work Photoshopping their own alternative mottos in its place. \n“Donations Hide in Darkness” certainly wouldn’t have ranked among the funniest, but it would have been appropriate Monday, when guest columnist Edward Price wrote at length about his decision to leave the CIA because he could not in good faith serve under the Trump administration. \"I didn’t think I’d ever leave the CIA.
