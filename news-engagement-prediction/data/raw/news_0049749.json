How long will it take to reopen the remaining 218 cases?” he said. \nIn a status report filed before the apex court on the probe conducted by the SIT, the Centre said there was a “considerable progress” and 218 cases were in various stages of scrutiny. It also said a “decision has been taken for re-investigation in respect of 22 cases”. \n“The SIT is not serious in ensuring justice to the anti-Sikh riots victims,” said AAP’s Delhi unit convener Dilip Pandey. \nSingh, who has contested the Punjab Assembly Polls from Lambi against chief minister Parkash Singh Badal and Congress’ chief ministerial candidate Amarinder Singh, said if the party came to power in the state, it will also probe the alleged irregularities in the disbursement of money meant for the riot victims. \n“Money sent by the Centre for those who fled to Punjab after the anti-Sikh riots was siphoned off. The Punjab government was supposed to disburse the money, but the full amount never reached the victims. We will investigate all these cases if we come to power in Punjab,” he said. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:32:48.821+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
