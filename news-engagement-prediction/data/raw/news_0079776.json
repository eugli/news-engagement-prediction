But he never thought the magical appearance during the act would turn out to be his father, home after almost a year of deployment in Kuwait . When magician Justin Impossible disappeared behind a curtain, Drake’s father, Benjamin, an active First Sergeant in the Nevada Army Guard Reserve, appeared on stage to greet Drake and his older brother Zachary, 11. \n\"I was excited to see my kids,\" Benjamin, 38, said while discussing his return from his third deployment. \"If you’ve deployed a few times you don’t know how your kids are going to react, but it was a great reaction.\" \n\nDeployed Soldier Comes Hoypeme Early, Surprises 3 Kids at School Events \n\nReturning Soldier Surprises Mother While She's at Work \nKrainbrink told ABC News that he had been planning this surprise with his wife and the magician since December. Krainbrink was even home a week before Drake’s birthday party hiding out in a hotel to make sure the surprise was perfect. \n\"People have made lots of special requests in my shows to have stuffed animals appear for children or a wedding ring appear for a proposal,\" Justin Impossible said. \"But that was the first time making a person like Benjamin appear for his family and that was very special.\" \nKrainbrink and his son have always shared a love for magic tricks, he said, and Drake had his ninth birthday party at Impossible’s magic theater last year. Drake has been taking magic lessons at Impossible’s shop in Reno, Nevada, so Benjamin and his wife Christina knew that it would be a perfect surprise. \nNow that the twenty-year veteran is back home, he looks forward to going on vacation with his wife and taking the entire family to Disney World in April.\n0 Shares Email Star Comments \" \nSoldier appears at son's magic party after coming home   \nTakata pleads guilty in air bag scandal, agrees to pay $1B \" \nPhiladelphia   \" \nOscars mistake puts consulting firm's reputation in jeopardy \" \nGaffe again: Oscars' In Memoriam includes living producer \" \n911 call: Bar shooting suspect said he'd killed 'Iranians' \" \nCalifornia dam spillway water shut off to clear debris \" \nWhat to know about the president's 'designated survivor' \" \nBuffett's bite of Apple even bigger than thought     \nHealth care, Supreme Court on agenda as Congress returns \" \nMan who tried to stop Kansas shooting says he was 'happy' to risk his life to save others \" \nTrump toasts nation's governors before health care talks   \nTop moments from the Academy Awards \" \nAll the Oscar winners \" \nBest actor winner Casey Affleck pays tribute to Denzel Washington \" \nBest actress winner Emma Stone thanks 'greatest partner' Ryan Gosling \" \n1st-time Oscar winners share backstage emotions on Hollywood's biggest night \" \nGOP tax plans could eliminate popular tax breaks \" \n4 N.
