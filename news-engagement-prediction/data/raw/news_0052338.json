Rec Before taking a job as Los Angeles Lakers president of basketball operations on Tuesday, Magic Johnson was a basketball adviser to Lakers ownership. We now know how that advisory role came about in early February. Johnson called to check in on Buss after her breakup with New York Knicks president and ex-Lakers coach Phil Jackson , according to the Los Angeles Times’ Tania Ganguli . The two ate dinner together, and Buss later invited Johnson to attend a Lakers game as her guest. Once at dinner, they talked more about Magic returning to the organization and this evolved from there. — Tania Ganguli (@taniaganguli) February 21, 2017 Buss and Jackson separated after coming to a agreement in late December that neither could focus on their partner and their franchise. That set the stage for Johnson to make his pitch and reconnect with Buss.
