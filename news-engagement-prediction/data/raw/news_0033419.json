One of the officials, speaking to the Post, said that “either Flynn had misled Pence or that Pence misspoke.”\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has denied that there was any discussion of sanctions between Flynn and Kislyak, saying the information is “not correct.”\nFlynn and Kislyak are said to have communicated via text message, phone call, and in person on numerous occasions, and while no explicit guarantee was given that sanctions would be lifted, the calls did leave the impression that it could well be a possibility.\nContrary to what Trump’s team has stated publicly, the calls allegedly began prior to the election last November and continued throughout the transition period.\nFlynn, seen here w/ Putin, discussed lifting sanctions with Russia's ambassador pre-inauguration & lied about it. pic.twitter.com/RXjrspuEcr\n— Brian Klaas (@brianklaas) February 10, 2017\nAs a result, some officials believe that Flynn may have broken the law, citing the Logan Act , which states that a U.S. citizen cannot interfere in foreign diplomacy. The act dates back to a 1799 statute that has never been used to convict anyone, leaving officials unsure as to what would be needed to secure a conviction.\nReports last month said that Flynn spoke to Kislyak on five separate occasions on Dec. 29 – the same day that Obama imposed sanctions on 35 Russian intelligence agents – with the calls said to have taken place after the Kremlin was informed of the sanctions but before Putin announced there would be no reprisals.\nObama imposed the latest set of sanctions against Russia for its alleged role in hacking into the DNC servers and disrupting the presidential election. Previously the U.S. had imposed sanctions on Russia for its annexation of Crimea in 2014.\nOn Wednesday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the two sets of sanctions would be treated differently. “Until Russia leaves Crimea, those sanctions are a non-starter,” but he failed to clarify whether or not the more recent sanctions could be lifted.\nLast month the Washington Post reported that the FBI had picked up communications between Flynn and Kislyak but had not found any evidence of wrongdoing or “illicit ties to the Russian government.” However reports by the Wall Street Journal , CNN and CBS refute this account, suggesting the FBI is still investigating the communications.\nFlynn’s links with Russia\nJust last month, Democrats called for an investigation into whether Flynn had violated Pentagon policy by receiving payment for a speech he gave at a banquet celebrating the 10th anniversary of state-run television station RT — an event also attended by Putin.\nAs a retired army officer, Flynn is prohibited from accepting direct or indirect payment from a foreign government, but he has said the payment came through a speakers bureau. Flynn has appeared on RT several times since, where he has argued for closer ties between the two countries.\nFlynn has previously shown a sort of grudging admiration for Putin. While calling the Russian president “a totalitarian dictator and a thug,” Flynn can also see his strengths. “Putin’s smart and savvy, and he has taken actions in Ukraine and elsewhere that have limited our options, and the U.S. and NATO response has been timid. I think Trump’s strength lies in being a master negotiator, and he wants as many options as possible in dealing with Russia,” Flynn said in an interview with Politico last year.\nCover: ASSOCIATED PRESS", "external_links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/national-security-adviser-flynn-discussed-sanctions-with-russian-ambassador-despite-denials-officials-say/2017/02/09/f85b29d6-ee11-11e6-b4ff-ac2cf509efe5_story.html?utm_term=.65e167bd228f", "https://t.co/RXjrspuEcr", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Act", "https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/08/press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-282017-10", "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/10/how-mike-flynn-became-americas-angriest-general-214362", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/fbi-reviewed-flynns-calls-with-russian-ambassador-but-found-nothing-illicit/2017/01/23/aa83879a-e1ae-11e6-a547-5fb9411d332c_story.html?utm_term=.a2b8b238e371", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-eyes-michael-flynns-links-to-russia-1485134942", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=National", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/us/flynn-is-said-to-have-talked-to-russians-about-sanctions-before-trump-took-office.html?emc=edit_mbe_20170210&nl=morning-briefing-europe&nlid=78140366&te=1", "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-flynn-trump-national-security-adviser-russia-phone-calls-investigation/", "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-idUSKBN14X1YX", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-did-obama-dawdle-on-russias-hacking/2017/01/12/75f878a0-d90c-11e6-9a36-1d296534b31e_story.html?utm_term=.478c5ba29468", "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/23/politics/flynn-russia-calls-investigation/index.html", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/national-security-adviser-flynn-discussed-sanctions-with-russian-ambassador-despite-denials-officials-say/2017/02/09/f85b29d6-ee11-11e6-b4ff-ac2cf509efe5_story.html?utm_term=.3ea161ac457b", "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2017/02/nine-people-say-mike-flynn-lied-about-his-phone-calls-russian-ambassador", "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/flynn-violated-constitution-russia-speech-democrats/story?id=45200852", "https://twitter.com/brianklaas/status/830000811665092613", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.vice.com%2Fstory%2Fnational-security-advisor-michael-flynn-discussed-sanctions-with-russia-before-trump-took-office", "http://tass.com/politics/930165", "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/face-the-nation-transcript-january-15-2017-pence-manchin-gingrich/"], "published": "2017-02-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T08:06:14.813+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
