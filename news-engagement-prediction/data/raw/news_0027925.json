ADVERTISEMENT \n“I know you answered the interview with the best of your ability, I understand it’s hard to answer too many questions but I honestly wish you had addressed the money issue,” Vanessa added \nSince any break-up is a personal business belonging only to the parties involved, Vanessa said that Gonzales and Daniel did not owe anybody any explanation but urged the actress to “please look back at the good times.” \n“Remember, you were with us for two years, you were included in every family plan, trips, weddings. We took care of you and your family and took in consideration your preferences and watched over you. I’m not here to measure what we did for each other because this is love and it comes with it naturally. All I’m saying is I’m very sad to see people defaming not only you and my brother but also my mom and family,” she said. \nEven amid the break-up saga, her family was still defending Gonzales from all the hate, said Vanessa. \n“We all love you to the best of our abilities and with all our hearts. It’s your choice to unfollow us, delete your photos, some people move on that way, ‘out of sight out of mind,’ others would like to treasure the memories, whatever works best right? Whatever it is we respect that and chose to give you your privacy,” Vanessa told Gonzales. \nVanessa asked Gonzales to “please address this issue, people are calling us users, but you know best and you know the truth. I’m counting on your integrity, dignity and your love for our Lord Jesus.” \nIn response, Gonzles sent a text message to ABS-CBN News’ Marie Lozano, saying she preferred to keep to herself what happened between her and Daniel. \n“Gusto ko na po sana manahimik na lang at mag-move on na pero sila ‘yung comment ng comment sa social media. Social media is not the proper venue. I turned off the comment section of my Instagram account kasi pagpipiyestahan lang ng mga tao, lalong hahaba at hindi matatapos,” she said. \nHowever, a fierce Gonzales fired back at Vanessa: “Hindi ako mayaman, Vanessa. Tama ka; mahirap lang ako, hindi ako kasing yaman ng napangasawa mo. Pero sa mundong ito, ang realidad, hindi lang mayayaman ang nate-take advantage. Mas maraming mahirap ang napapagsamantalahan.” \nGonzales stressed that she really did not want to talk about her failed relationship anymore but that if provoked further, she would speak up. \n“They want me to speak up, I will. I will tell all,” she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T15:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T11:27:26.903+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
