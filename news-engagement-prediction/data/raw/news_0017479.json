The zinc replaces the hydrogen:Zn + 2 HCl → ZnCl 2 + H 2 \nMetathesis or Double Displacement Reaction In a double displacement or metathesis reaction two compounds exchange bonds or ions in order to form different compounds .AB + CD → AD + CBAn example of a double displacement reaction occurs between sodium chloride and silver nitrate to form sodium nitrate and silver chloride.NaCl(aq) + AgNO 3 (aq) → NaNO 3 (aq) + AgCl(s)\nAcid-Base Reaction An acid-base reaction is type of double displacement reaction that occurs between an acid and a base. The H + ion in the acid reacts with the OH - ion in the base to form water and an ionic salt:HA + BOH → H 2 O + BAThe reaction between hydrobromic acid (HBr) and sodium hydroxide is an example of an acid-base reaction:HBr + NaOH → NaBr + H 2 O\nOxidation-Reduction or Redox Reaction In a redox reaction the oxidation numbers of atoms are changed. Redox reactions may involve the transfer of electrons between chemical species.The reaction that occurs when In which I 2 is reduced to I - and S 2 O 3 2- ( thiosulfate anion ) is oxidized to S 4 O 6 2- provides an example of a redox reaction :2 S 2 O 3 2− (aq) + I 2 (aq) → S 4 O 6 2− (aq) + 2 I − (aq)\nCombustion A combustion reaction is a type of redox reaction in which a combustible material combines with an oxidizer to form oxidized products and generate heat ( exothermic reaction ). Usually in a combustion reaction oxygen combines with another compound to form carbon dioxide and water . An example of a combustion reaction is the burning of naphthalene:C 10 H 8 + 12 O 2 → 10 CO 2 + 4 H 2 O\nIsomerization In an isomerization reaction, the structural arrangement of a compound is changed but its net atomic composition remains the same.\nA hydrolysis reaction involves water. The general form for a hydrolysis reaction is:X - (aq) + H 2 O(l) ↔ HX(aq) + OH - (aq)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:46:45.139+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
