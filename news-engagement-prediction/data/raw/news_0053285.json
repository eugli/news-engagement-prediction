It's also cheaper to fill up these trucks: The gas costs 35 percent less than diesel, and that could save Waitrose about $25,000 a year in fuel costs—so it's no wonder other companies across the country are lining up to use the renewable fuel. \nAs a bonus, using biomethane gas cuts carbon emissions by up to 70 percent. That's a real appeal for a company that's been rolling out eco-friendly initiatives for years. Last year, Waitrose introduced new packaging for its pastas made from green peas and red lentils. And since 2012, Waitrose has committed to giving any unsold food—that is not fit to be donated—to companies that create electricity through anaerobic digestion , according to the grocer's website . \nWhile Waitrose may be paving the way for biomethane gas to be used in vehicles, other companies around the world have long been coming up with creative ways to fuel cars. In New Zealand, for example, a brewery in 2015 rolled out \"brewtroleum,\" a fuel made from beer by-product. And Scottish company Celtic Renewables has made strides in recent years to make biofuel from whiskey fermentation by-product .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:07:54.156+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
