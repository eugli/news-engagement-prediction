(Pics inside) \nChemists have long sought an efficient, light-driven catalyst to power this reaction, which could help reduce the growing levels of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere by converting it into methane. \nNot only are the rhodium nanoparticles made more efficient when illuminated by light, they have the advantage of strongly favouring the formation of methane rather than an equal mix of methane and undesirable side-products like carbon monoxide. \nThe researchers said, this strong \"selectivity\" of the light-driven catalysis may also extend to other important chemical reactions. \nJie Liu, professor of chemistry at Duke University, said \"The fact that you can use light to influence a specific reaction pathway is very exciting. This discovery will really advance the understanding of catalysis\". \nDespite being one of the rarest elements on Earth, rhodium plays a surprisingly important role in our everyday lives. \nSmall amounts of the silvery grey metal are used to speed up or \"catalyse\" a number of key industrial processes, including those that make drugs, detergents and nitrogen fertilizer, and they even play a major role breaking down toxic pollutants in the catalytic converters of our cars. \nRhodium accelerates these reactions with an added boost of energy, which usually comes in the form of heat because it is easily produced and absorbed. \nHowever, high temperatures also cause problems, like shortened catalyst lifetimes and the unwanted synthesis of undesired products. \n\"Effectively, plasmonic metal nanoparticles act like little antennas that absorb visible or ultraviolet light very efficiently and can do a number of things like generate strong electric fields,\" said Henry Everitt, from Duke. \nXiao Zhang, a graduate student in Liu's lab, synthesised rhodium nanocubes that were the optimal size for absorbing near-ultraviolet light. \nHe then placed small amounts of the charcoal-colored nanoparticles into a reaction chamber and passed mixtures of carbon dioxide and hydrogen through the powdery material. \nWhen Zhang heated the nanoparticles to 300 degrees Celsius, the reaction generated an equal mix of methane and carbon monoxide, a poisonous gas. \nWhen he turned off the heat and instead illuminated them with a high-powered ultraviolet LED lamp, Zhang was not only surprised to find that carbon dioxide and hydrogen reacted at room temperature, but that the reaction almost exclusively produced methane. \nThe research was published in the journal Nature Communications. \n(With PTI inputs) First Published: Thursday, February 23, 2017 - 23:20 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:02:52.628+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
