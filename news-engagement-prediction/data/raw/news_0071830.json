She walks to the washing up station to do chores, then wanders around in the dark outside of camp.\nWhile the others sleep, Malkah's all action. Source: Channel 10 \nAs Malkah went for one late-night wander, Smith said he was sure she was walking off the show.\n“I thought, ‘She’s out!’ She’s called it in the middle of the night. But I woke up and she’s still here.”\nSmith said that, despite their differences, he wanted to make sure Malkah was OK:\n“I don’t want to see anybody down or depressed, irrespective of their thoughts of me — I don’t really care about that.”\nSmith said he was sure Malkah had walked out of the show. Source: Channel 10 \nMalkah, who in the past has surprised her fellow contestants by praying under a sheet in the middle of camp, has now taken to eating the same way.\nAsked what she was doing by former Bachelor contestant Keira Maguire, Malkah offered a bizarre explanation:\nMalkah (foreground) has taken to eating her meals while hiding under a sheet. Source: Channel 10 \n“I don’t like eating looking at toxic people, it’s bad for your digestion.”\nConfiding to the cameras, Malkah acknowledged that her mental state had been “fragile”:\n“Because I have been working on myself for the last few years, the walls have been coming down, which means there are some fragile spots now. I’m not as easy-breezy as I used to be. I think that will probably change, because I am transitioning at the moment,” she said.\nThis strikes us as very 'Pete Evans' food advice Source: Channel 10 \n“I don’t think any of us here would choose to be with every single person that’s here. Every single person at camp that rubs them up the wrong way.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T16:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:46:33.292+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
