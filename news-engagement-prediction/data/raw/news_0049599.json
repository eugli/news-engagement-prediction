Analysts have said the new park would divert some Disney fans in northern China away from the Hong Kong park.\nBut Lau stopped short of attributing the mainland visitor decline to the new competitor, saying: “China’s market is big enough to accommodate two Disneylands.”\nNew food truck dishes out noodles at Disneyland’s doorstep \nDisneyland is now seeking approval from the Legislative Council for a HK$5.8 billion cash injection for its six-year, HK$10.9 ­billion expansion, featuring attractions based on the hit film Frozen and Marvel superhero films.\nVisitor numbers to Hong Kong overall slumped 4.5 per cent last year, the worst figures since 2003, when the city was hit by Sars.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T22:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T09:36:01.622+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
