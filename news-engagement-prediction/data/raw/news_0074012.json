She said: \"There's still a lot of fear and embarrassment surrounding smear tests and as a result too many of us aren't getting checked out. \n\"I hope this campaign will get people talking about cervical screening and how important it is that we all make time for our regular smears. \n\"I admit, going for a smear is not something I look forward to, but the consequences of not going could be much worse.\" 'Reassure women' \nSix women are diagnosed with cervical cancer every week in Scotland, and it is the most common cancer in women aged 25 to 35. \nBut figures show that one in three women in this age group do not go for their smear test when invited. \nCampaigners say the five-minute test is the best way to protect women from cancer, helping to save around 5,000 lives a year in the UK. \nChristine Paterson, a practice nurse at NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, said: \"No-one looks forward to a smear appointment, but I want to reassure women that we're trained to make the test go as smoothly as possible. \n\"I've done hundreds of smear tests and afterwards, most women - especially those that it's their first time - are surprised by how quickly it's all over. \n\"Don't ignore your next smear invite, and if you missed your last smear test, contact your GP practice to find a time that suits you.\" Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T19:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T00:42:13.439+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
