(Joe Castro/AAP/Associated Press) \nA light plane carrying five people crashed into a shopping mall on Tuesday in the city of Melbourne, Australia, officials said. \nThere were no immediate reports of casualties, but the twin-engine Beechcraft Super King Air crashed about 45 minutes before the Direct Factory Outlet mall was to open, Police Minister Lisa Neville said. \nThe plane had taken off from Melbourne's second-biggest airport at Essendon on a chartered flight to King Island, 255 kilometres to the south, Neville said. \nThe mall adjoins the airport. \nPolice Superintendent Mick Frewen said a pilot reported a \"catastrophic engine failure\" moments before the plane crashed into a storage area at the rear of the mall. \nPolice and paramedics rushed to the crash site, where firefighters doused the flames.
