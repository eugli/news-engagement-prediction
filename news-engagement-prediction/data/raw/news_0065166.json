John Gillon (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 9:53 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 9:53 p.m. ET \nWhere in the world would Syracuse be without John Gillon? \nGillon's buzzer-beating 3-pointer pushed Syracuse past No. 10 Duke, 78-75, at the Carrier Dome Wednesday night. The win is huge for the Orange's NCAA Tournament hopes and breaks their three-game losing streak. John Gillon just beat Duke at the buzzer with a banked-in three. What a game. pic.twitter.com/VuGHdhxJb5 â€” Rob Dauster (@RobDauster) February 23, 2017 \nThe Orange are now (17-12, 8-7 ACC) and face No. 7 Louisville on the road on Sunday. \nMORE: Latest projected March Madness bracket \nGillon, who transferred to Syracuse after spending one year at Arkansas-Little Rock and three at Colorado State, finished with 26 points against Duke. \nGillon is having an up-and-down season for Syracuse, but when the Orange win, he's is usually a big reason why. \nBefore Syracuse's three-game skid, the Orange won five straight. Gillon was huge down the stretch to seal a five-point win against Wake Forest. He scored 21 against then-No. 6 Florida State, including scoring Syracuse's last 13. Most notably, he scored 43 points in a come-from-behind, overtime win against NC State. Gillon's late 3-pointer sent the game into OT. \nIf Syracuse wants to continue to push toward a Tourney bid, it needs more nights like Wednesday from Gillon. \nFor Duke, the loss snaps a seven-game winning streak. Luke Kennard led the Blue Devils with 23 points, while Jayson Tatum had 19 points and 13 rebounds. \nDuke travels to Miami on Saturday.
