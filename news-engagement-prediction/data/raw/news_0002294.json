(Photo: Getty Images) \nThe Houston Rockets retired the jersey of Hall of Famer Yao Ming during halftime of the game on Friday night. The 36-year-old had the crowd laughing several times as he thanked the fans and reflected back on his nine-year NBA career. \nOne of the stories that Yao told that stood out was toward the end of his speech (begins around the 5:42 mark of the video). The ending will make your heart melt. \"Thank you for the journey.\" @YaoMing reflects on his career as his No. 11 jersey is lifted to the rafters. #ThankYouYao pic.twitter.com/Dn4Wtmk7V2 â€” NBA TV (@NBATV) February 4, 2017 \nYao told the story before in an excellent Players' Tribune piece , but this time he added an extra detail. \nHe explained that the Rockets surprised him for Chinese New Year when he was a rookie. It was the first time he had ever been overseas for the holiday, and he said it meant a lot to him that his teammates, coaches and everyone went through the effort of doing what they could to make him feel at home in Houston. \nYao said they even gave him a red envelope with money in it - a traditional Chinese New Year gift - but, as the crowd laughed, he said when he opened it up, he saw that there was only $2 inside, which is way less than he expected. \nHowever, even though he was given a hilariously small amount of cash, Yao said it's a moment he'll remember forever. \n\"I still have one of those two dollar bills inside my pocket, and I carried it since then,\" Yao said, as the crowd cheered, \"because I know no matter where I go, as long as that bill's in my pocket, home is with me.\" Read or Share this story: http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/02/yao-ming-touching-story-jersey-retired-rockets-chinese-new-year-rookie-wallet-dollar-home/ Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T11:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T06:39:19.163+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
