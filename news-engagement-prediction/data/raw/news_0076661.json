Here is the list of warning lamp signs By: FE Online | Updated: February 25, 2017 11:30 PM Warning signs \nWhen there is a problem or any feature in a car is engaged, it is immediately indicated on the instrument cluster of a car. There are many warning signs in your cars such as low fuel capacity, engine temperature, hand brake is engaged and so on. If you also come across any of these warning lights, do not panic. Here is the list of warning lamp signs which many car manufacturers use in order to indicate any fault in the electronics of the vehicle or engine. \nThe above image shows many warning lights. The first indication is for fog lamps and turns on when the driver switches them on. \nThe second is the power steering warning light. It warns the driver that the power steering fluid in the steering reservoir is low and needs a refill. Some cars are offered with an electric power steering which would require you to get the system checked by a professional mechanic. Fuel indicator \nThis warning light indicates that the level of the washer fluid is low and needs to be refilled. \nCruise control light switches on when the driver engages the cruise control. \nWhen any of the tyre in a car has low air pressure, the Tyre Pressure Low warning turns on. This means you have to inflate the tyre to the optimum air pressure as per the tyre specifications. ABS sign \nThe ABS light switches on when there is a fault or malfunctioning in the ABS system. This fault may mean that the ABS sensor on any one or more wheels may have been damaged or there may be a fault in the entire ABS system. \nTraction Control is activated and light blinks on the console indicate that the system is working correctly. This system works when the car loses traction and it activates the brakes intermittently to regain control. Battery alert \nWhen there is fault in the engine, the Engine Warning Light or Check Engine switches on. The first thing one must do is park the car immediately and call for road side assistance. It may be a minor problem, but do not operate the car else the issue may become bigger. \nOther warning signs that a vehicle indicates such as hand brake light, indicator lights, high beam light and other lights have the purpose of indication and are not warning signs.
