Christopher Talbot AAP Share on Twitter \nA MELBOURNE grandfather saw a dark car and a figure moments before he was gunned down on a country bike track in northern Victoria. \nThe family of Kelvin Tennant, 72, believe he may have been about to ride past something the gunman “didn’t want him to see”. \nThe Ringwood man was hit with multiple bullets while riding the Myrtleford-Everton Rail Trail in Everton in the state’s northeast about midday on Saturday. \nMr Tennant, a retired schoolteacher, is in The Alfred Hospital with multiple gunshot injuries, including a number of pellets lodged in his head near his eyes and a number in his chest. \nHe is scheduled for surgery on Monday afternoon. Mr Tennant, a retired schoolteacher, is in The Alfred Hospital with multiple gunshot injuries, including a number of pellets lodged in his head near his eyes and a number in his chest. Picture: Natalie Knox Source: AAP Source: AAP \nPolice said on Monday that he was shot with a small calibre gun but they’re not yet sure what it was. \n“We’ll have to have a better look at the injuries and hopefully get some ballistics evidence to help us out,” Detective Senior Constable Elise Douglas told 3AW on Monday. \nThere is no other motive and he is just a “grandfather who enjoys cycling,” police say. \nMr Tennant’s son, Nick, says his father was believed to have been shot by a .22 pistol. \n“Dad just observed a dark coloured car in an unusual place and before he knew it, a person jumped out and fired shots at him,” Nick told reporters outside The Alfred Hospital on Monday. \n“The person was behind a bush and they walked towards him.” \nDaughter Natalie Knox said there was no reason for anyone to target him and he didn’t get a good look at the gunman. \n“He heard the gunshots but doesn’t remember seeing anyone, only a figure,” Ms Knox said. \n“He feels blessed and lucky and happy to be here. It was very close.” \nPolice are urging anyone, particularly cyclists that may have been on the track on Saturday, to come forward.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T12:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T08:11:00.895+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
