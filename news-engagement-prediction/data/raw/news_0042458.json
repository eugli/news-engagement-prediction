Theo Walcott left red-faced as Arsenal fans slam club for 'disrespectful' gesture \nSpeculation in Malcom’s native Brazil linked the forward to both Manchester United and Liverpool this week after his impressive performances this term. \nHowever, the 19-year-old insists he knows nothing about the interest and wants to focus on life in France. \n‘This thing about Liverpool (and) Manchester – I don’t know anything about it,’ said Malcom. \n‘I’m very calm, I only think about Bordeaux today. I want to do my job well and give French fans lots of joy. \n‘I got to know, yeah, that Sampaoli (Sevilla boss) likes my football, my game style. If the opportunity shows up, I’ll be happy.
