I work with some amazing and dedicated people,\" he said at the time. \nFor many years he assisted in the operation of the Kingston Flyer under various owners but in 2015 he publicly severed his association citing owner David Bryce's refusal to accept the real value of the train Ad Feedback \n\"The Flyer is deteriorating badly and its actual worth, plus any possible chance of it being repaired, has dropped dramatically. \n\"It would be my sincere wish that the owner could display some respect for the value of the asset and its employment possibilities in Kingston, instead of selling off land and a carriage,\" he said. \nThe train remains unsold.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:54:45.851+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
