Simon Russell Flint, defending, said during his mitigation: 'It has to be acknowledged that, as the jury's verdict reflects, he has burdened both the family of Helen Bailey and his own family with incalculable loss, a lifetime of misery, sorrow and suffering and he will have a long time to reflect on the consequences of those actions. 'The likelihood is, given his state of health, the sentence has a like-effect of a whole-life order. 'There is every prospect and likelihood Mr Stewart will end his days behind bars.' Video of Stewart's arrest showed him worrying about the garage where her body was hidden Stewart targeted the vulnerable widow on the internet in 2011, earning his way into her trust and later her £3.3 million estate after launching a 'love-bombing' offensive. He became the chief heir to her riches, standing to gain around £1.8 million from her investment portfolio, plus the value of their home in Royston, Hertfordshire, and her coastal cottage in Kent. Over many weeks, Stewart surreptitiously fed Ms Bailey his prescription anti-insomnia drug, Zopiclone, possibly by slipping it into her morning scrambled eggs. Hours after the murder, he illicitly boosted a standing order to himself from her account, earning him an extra £12,000 over the three months following her disappearance. Judge Andrew Bright, who will sentence Stewart at 10am on Thursday, told Mr Russell Flint: 'You will have a hard job to persuade me this wasn't a murder for gain, it's quite clear to me that it was.' He added: 'He may have had mixed motives, one doesn't know what other motives there could have been, quite frankly. But money is, in my judgment, the most obvious and principal reason he did what he did.' Detectives are to probe the sudden death of Stewart's first wife, Diane, who was found in the couple's garden in 2010. An inquest at the time concluded she died of natural causes from a 'sudden unexpected death in epilepsy'. Did he kill before? Police to re-examine death of killer's wife Detectives revealed they would be re-examining the death of Stewart's late wife Diane following his conviction for the murder of Helen Bailey. Diane died aged 47 on June 25, 2010, on the back patio of the home she shared with Stewart and their two sons in Bassingbourn, Cambridgeshire. Her death certificate states the cause was 'sudden unexpected death in epilepsy' and there was an inquest, but no criminal investigation at the time. Police are to launch a new probe into the death of Ian Stewart's first wife Diane (pictured) in the wake of his conviction for the murder of children's author Helen Bailey DCI Jerome Kent of the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said it would not be a criminal investigation into Diane's death, but a re-examination. Speaking after the verdict, DCI Kent said: 'It would be expected of me to have a look into Diane's death following this conviction to see if there's anything that could be done. 'It's not a criminal investigation, it's not a murder investigation, there are no suspects. 'When someone is convicted of murder or involved in murder it is only right that we would look back at their past. 'We are a long way off seeing if any other offences have been committed.' Diane Stewart is pictured with sons Jamie and Oliver and her husband Ian in 2009 He said Stewart was not being treated as a suspect in the re-examination and Diane's body had been cremated after her death. DCI Kent also said he was unaware of Diane's will or whether he had benefited from it. Diane and Stewart lived with their sons Jamie Stewart, 24, and Oliver Stewart, 21, in Bassingbourn, Cambs., after getting married in 1986. After Diane died, Stewart later met Helen through an online group for widows and widowers and they planned to get married in September last year. Murdered by the man she was about to marry: Grieving author thought she had found her 'happy ending' with 'gorgeous, grey-haired widower' who became her killer It was not just Helen Bailey's family who grieved for her when she was found dead last summer. As well as the thousands of teenage fans of her Electra Brown novels, the writer had gained a huge following to her searingly honest blog about losing her first husband. The online diary, which was later turned into a book called When Bad Things Happen in Good Bikinis, told of her husband John Sinfield's death in Barbados in 2011 and her long battle to come to terms with her loss. Helen Bailey with her first husband John Sinfield. After witnessing him drown in Barbados in 2011. She started writing an acclaimed blog about her grief which later became a book It was through her attempts to cope with his death that she met Ian Stewart, in a Facebook bereavement group, and she wrote to her followers telling them of her hopes she had found a 'happy ending'. But she could not then have known that the man she dubbed her 'Gorgeous Grey-Haired Widower' or 'GGHW' would later kill her in a shocking plot to get his hands on her money. Ms Bailey was born and brought up in the village Ponteland, Northumbria, the daughter of a public health inspector. She studied physiology at Thames Polytechnic before embarking on a PhD, but was put off science when dealing with 'vomiting ferrets' at a London teaching hospital and decided to become a secretary. A temporary post at a licensing agency in 1987 led to her meeting her husband, father-of-two and twice-married Mr Sinfield, as they stood at a photocopier. Mr Sinfield was described as a very different character to Stewart, who she later met online Mr Sinfield was a former BBC executive who went on to set up his own licensing company, handling the merchandising rights of characters such as Snoopy, Garfield and ET. The couple set up home in North London at the height of the 'Yuppie boom' and drove around in a flashy Lotus Elan. They married in Barbados in May 1996 and, while working negotiating contracts, Ms Bailey started writing in her free time, publishing over twenty books of short stories and young-adult fiction, including the successful teenage Electra Brown novels. Ms Bailey described her A-level results as 'spectacularly disastrous', but she went on to study science before becoming a successful writer of teen fiction It was on a return trip to holiday island of Barbados in 2011 that Ms Bailey's life would be changed forever when she watched her husband sink beneath the waves and drown. She later wrote of the tragedy: 'The day itself is a blur. For such a private, dignified man, he had a very public and undignified death, though I feel sure that he would not have known anything about it; that my screaming, the yells of the crowd, all fell on ears wired into an oxygen-starved brain. 'When everyone left — the doctors, the British consulate staff, the police — the momentum of death stopped. And I was alone.' Writer Helen turned her grief into an acclaimed blog and book, pouring her heart out to readers, many of whom were a similar situation. She wrote five months after John's death: 'It's been the most shockingly tearful start to August I've ever known. I've sobbed the length of Oxford Street, at the bus stop and on the bus; all over a poor woman walking her dog on Hampstead Heath and in the changing rooms at Uniqlo while trying to find a pair of jeans.' Ms Bailey had not been looking for new love after her husband's death and wrote that she was shocked when she had a 'disgustingly inappropriate thought' about Stewart while walking through the underwear department of M&S. Feeling 'sleazy, guilty and ashamed' she encouraged him to date other women but their daily messages continued. Ms Bailey met Stewart through a bereavement group on Facebook after his wife died in 2010 Ms Bailey later wrote that she would have been 'devastated' if he had met someone else and they eventually arranged a date - lunch at the National Portrait Gallery and an afternoon screening of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy in Leicester Square. It was a 'tearful, angst-ridden disaster, and an acknowledgement that it was all too soon', she wrote. Their friendship was put on hold. 'There were no more funny emails, no witty texts. Life felt even darker than it was already. I missed him,' she wrote. After a break, they started 'uncomplicated' dog walking again. During one walk on Hampstead Heath, near Ms Bailey's London home, Stewart got stuck in mud and the author said she was doubled up with laughter. He laughed too, and she recalled thinking: 'I don't want to lose that man from my life'. Former grammar schoolboy Stewart was born in Letchworth Garden City. His father was a teacher and his mother a secretary. Ms Bailey became a hero to many youngsters who read her Electra Brown novels He went on to study computer systems at Salford University, where he met his wife Diane. The couple later bought a home in Cambridge with compensation money he was awarded after slipping on an icy path and falling through a glass door while was a student. He worked at an engine company and drove an MG, but said both he and his wife suffered poor health, with Diane having had epileptic fits since she was at school. An attack later hospitalised her and prevented her from driving and in 2010 she collapsed in their garden and tragically died. Police have now confirmed they are investigating the circumstances of her death. After his wife's death, Stewart was left to care for their sons, Jamie and Oliver, who were aged 18 and 15. Ms Bailey had written about how she and Stewart were supporting each other through the grief of losing their partners He learnt about groups for widows and widowers from a book he was given by one of Diane's bridesmaids and it was through one of these groups he met Ms Bailey. He told his trial about their whirlwind romance, saying: 'After a while we exchanged email addresses, and we started long email discussions. Our emails became bigger and bigger. 'We were talking about where we lived, we sent photos of our houses. She attached a photo of one of the houses and said tomorrow night she would be on her own. 'On that photo she had an address. I saw this as a subtle invite, I drove up unannounced to her house and text her to say I was here. 'She rushed out to see me, she was only wearing pyjamas, she wasn't happy but she was. We both fell into each other's arms.' They became closer over time, with both apparently concerned about their previous loss. Stewart told the jury: 'It became apparent over the years that myself and John Sinfield were very different people, he was very sophisticated smooth and suave, I was not. Helen was very different to Diane. But either way we just really clicked.' Stewart sold his £520,000 home and put most of the money into the £1.5million home he bought with Ms Bailey. His two sons moved in with the couple as well. Ms Bailey wrote: 'We supported each other and grew stronger. I'm still shell-shocked that my life after JS's death is so different from my life before. 'It's not always easy living in a home that came together through sudden death. But life is good in ways that over four years ago I could never have imagined.' She was not looking for love when she met Stewart and confessed to feeling guilty The pair's romance seemed to be moving on apace, Ms Bailey told friends of their plans to marry and drew up a new will to give Stewart the house. She told a friend: 'If anything, god forbid happens to me, the one thing I want to make sure is that Ian and the boys have the security of this house.' It was a prediction which was to become a sickening reality when, after three months in which she was treated as missing, her body was found in a cesspit beneath the garage of their home. Body language expert says killer's actions on arrest showed his guilt A body language expert has said Stewart was good at hiding his lies but showed his guilt through his actions when he was arrested. Cliff Lansley, an emotional language analyst, watched the police footage of Stewart's arrest and interviews for a Channel 5 documentary on the murder. He said Stewart's selfishness when he was arrested showed his lack of concern for Ms Bailey. Emotional language analyst Cliff Lansley says Stewart's actions gave him away Mr Lansley said of the arrest: 'This is 7am in the morning and he's just been told that he's being arrested on suspicion of murder, that would suggest the lady of his life, his fiance, is dead. And his reaction is so blunt. 'There's no shock, there's no horror, there's no interest in Helen at all. That's highly unusual. 'The only time he starts to move towards Helen rather than himself is when he says; 'Where is she?' and then he turns and comments on the garage door being open. The connection between the cesspit and the where is she, did he make that link consciously or subconsciously?' Mr Lansley says the footage of Stewart's interview while Helen was supposedly missing was clever in that he mixed facts about where he went with fiction, to make it more convincing. Stewart told police he had been to the dump and to the solicitors, but said he couldn't remember other parts of the day. Mr Lansley said: 'He's using truth as a screen but in between we are getting these lack of memory pieces which are giving him away.' Murdered By My Fiancé, will be broadcast on Channel 5 tonight at 10pm. Mr Lansley said Stewart's response was 'blunt' and showed little concern for Helen Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T13:56:44.926+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
