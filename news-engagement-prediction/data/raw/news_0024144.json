Decades later, after she was widowed — and no longer moonshining — she met the agent again and married him. Recalling his and his wife’s reaction to the landlady’s tale, Mr. Mosher told Vermont Public Radio, “Both of us knew, without saying a word, that I would write the stories of the Northeast Kingdom, come hell or high water.” The gist of the landlady’s story found its way into Mr. Mosher’s 1978 book, “Where the Rivers Flow North,” a novella and stories. Jay Craven, who has made five films based on the author’s books — including “Northern Borders” (2015), with Bruce Dern and Geneviève Bujold, and “Disappearances” (2006), with Kris Kristofferson — likened Mr. Mosher’s work to investigating a fading civilization. “Howard arrived at the last minute to observe the culture of a Vermont that was still rooted in the late 19th century,” Mr. Craven said in a phone interview. “So he approached it as an archaeologist or anthropologist; he dug deeply into the natural world and came away with an intense motivation to collect everything he could.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story In addition to his wife, Mr. Mosher is survived by his daughter, Annie; his son, Jake; two grandchildren; and a brother, Terry. His mother died on Jan. 23, six days before he did, at 102. Mr. Mosher was known for his unflagging support of fellow authors and independent bookstores. His publicity tours usually started at the Galaxy Bookshop in Hardwick, Vt., where he would read from his newest book or give a slide show, which sometimes featured a picture of Mr. Mosher blasting a negative newspaper review with his shotgun. His last appearance at the store, in 2015, attracted such a crowd that it had to be moved to a nearby opera house. “The real drama and the real entertainment came when he talked about what inspired his books,” Sandy Scott, a co-owner of the bookstore, said in an interview. “That’s when his personality came out.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T07:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T03:16:41.765+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
