After undoubtedly developing a firm friendship based on the program's ability to work her phone, Instagram user marissajo87 worked up the courage to ask Siri to be her Valentine. Cruel as it is skilled, Siri declined, telling her: 'That's sweet, but I, uh, already, um, have plans. Yeah. I have plans'. Ghosting: One woman searched high and low for a date, but was let down, even by Siri Another tried to spend her morning celebrating love despite her lack of partner, but was let down at the first hurdle - cooking heart shaped eggs. It appears the home cook had cracked the eggs into the pan before adding the metal heart shapers. Those who have a Valentine but failed to keep their eye on the calendar have been left struggling to find an appropriate gift. Yikes: Another woman struggled to make herself a loved-up meal, as her heart shaped egg rings did nothing to contain her breakfast Preparing for a meat cute? Shops tried to help out forgetful partners with practical gifts, like a heart shaped steak Last minute leftovers included a heart-shaped meatloaf, and a heart shaped steak, both deemed questionable gifts by social media users. Kenyan supermarket Nukumatt tried to spread the love to everyone, but struggled with appropriate product placement. Below a shelf of condoms and lubricant, and above a shelf of champagne was a heart shaped sign encouraging customers to 'share the love with dad'. Yikes: Kenyan supermarket Nakumatt tried to spread the love, but failed miserably in their sign placing One shop pre-made cakes which should have read 'hug me', but instead read: 'huge me'. Also on the list of definite rejects in the supermarket is a series of heart shaped candies with words printed on. While the hearts would ordinarily say sweet nothings like 'I love you' or 'be mine', someone in the factory appears to have taken their bad day out on these candies. While some have the expected messages, others read 'mistake', 'no way' and 'walk on by'. Not-so-sweets: While heart shaped candies usually have sweet nothing printed on them, a factory worker appears to have taken their bad day out on the sweets What could it be?! One woman was disappointed to be handed a powder blue Tiffany's bag, only to find socks in place of expensive jewellery Even those who had prepared in advance failed to hit the mark, with one woman let down by a very misleading gift. Presented with a powder blue Tiffany's bag, Instagram user ohmycheeks thought she was about to receive some expensive designer jewellery. Though still expensive, she couldn't help but be disappointed when the bag contained a pair of colourful happy socks instead.
