They noted that in the El Paso area, the Department of Family and Protective Services is about to take bids for private delivery of family based safety services. The work involves such things as making birth parents obtain drug counseling or attend parenting classes while they keep custody of their kids. \nAlso, bill author Sen. Charles Schwertner has questioned as too ambitious a proposal by department chief Henry \"Hank\" Whitman to roll out foster care redesign to eight more regions in the next two years. That's in addition to the Fort Worth area and the Abilene-to-Wichita Falls region, where a lead contractor is expected to be named soon. \nStill, if Schwertner's bill becomes law, it potentially could threaten about 3,200 CPS caseworker jobs, according to a Dallas Morning News analysis. That's nearly 55 percent of the approximately 5,800 caseworkers for whom agency leaders successfully sought big pay raises late last year. The various privatization pushes would have to extend statewide for so many to lose their jobs - something Senate GOP leaders have said is by no means a sure thing. Hiring preference for laid-off CPS workers \nIn a brief description of his newly revised bill Wednesday, Schwertner made no mention of state workers' job security. \nAs was true in previous versions, though, his measure would require lead contractors for community-based care to give preference in hiring to CPS workers who lost their jobs because of the case management outsourcing. \nThere's one caveat. CPS' parent, the, would have to deem the workers to be \"in good standing.\" \nSen. Charles Schwertner, R-Georgetown, debated the merits of case management privatization with judges and child advocates as he presided over a Senate Health and Human Services panel's meeting earlier this month. (Ralph Barrera/Austin American-Statesman via AP) \nSchwertner, an orthopedic surgeon who is the Senate's top health and human services policy writer, said he listened to stakeholders after a lengthy public hearing on the bill earlier this month . \nThe bill has new provisions that will guarantee tough oversight of vendors, eliminate conflicts of interest and preserve \"judicial authority,\" he told colleagues. \n\"The [bill] substitute before you represents a carefully crafted and extensively vetted compromise that will ensure we can move forward with a foster care and kinship system that better serves children and their families while ensuring proper oversight,\" Schwertner said. \nThe Health and Human Services Committee, which he heads, sent the bill to the full Senate by a vote of 9-0. \nThough GOP leaders in the House are moving a similar bill on case management outsouring, the Senate panel's action sets up a spirited battle - the first big one on child welfare privatization since 2007. \nIn 2005, the Legislature approved a pilot program for letting a private foster care provider's social worker take over the CPS conservatorship worker's duties. It never got off the ground, though. Two years later, outsourcing opponents persuaded lawmakers to repeal the program. Privatizing 'case management' -- pros and cons \nThe Texas Alliance of Child and Family Services, a coalition of the state's foster care and adoption providers, has long criticized the current setup as wasteful and duplicative. The group notes that CPS conservatorship workers create safety and service plans for each child - something the private workers also do - but also get to work with birth families on possible reunification. \nThe industry and Schwertner argue it's an impediment. The private contractors can't do the best job for children because their employees don't get to know birth parents and sometimes, siblings, they say. \nIn his latest rewrite, Schwertner sought to allay concerns by family court judges that having a third-party vendor before them in court - not a CPS worker - would diminish the judges' ability to force regional CPS field administrators to act quickly on behalf of children. \nAt a Feb. 2 hearing, several judges testified they often need to get things done fast for very vulnerable kids. They said they want before them in court the state's representative, the CPS worker, to send messages to those controlling state resources. \nSchwertner added provisions saying that the lead contractor must obey the judges and that the department may overrule a lead contractor's decision about an individual child. \nHe also sought to respond to fears of some child advocates that the lead contractors would be biased by financial considerations, or would take on too much risk and go bankrupt. \nThat could leave the state with no public caseworkers in a region - and a badly damaged provider network, as occurred when Providence Service Corp. of Texas pulled out of a redesign contract in West Texas in 2014. \nUnder Schwertner's latest version, before taking the reins in a region, the lead vendor - \"single source continuum contractor\" - would have to prepare and win the department's approval of a plan for avoiding and eliminating conflicts of interest. \nThe subcontractors, not just the lead contractors, would have to carry liability insurance \"to minimize the risk of insolvency,\" the bill says. A lead contractor would have to give 90 days' notice if it wants to end its contract early. Texas' answer to a federal judge? Maybe \nSchwertner's bill also would require local plans to be developed for increasing the foster-care system's capacity. \nTexas protective services chief Henry \" Hank\" Whitman, right, shown testifying to the Senate panel on Feb. 2, has urged that the procurement method known as \"foster care redesign\" be up and running in 10 regions of the state by August 2019. (Ralph Barrera/Austin American-Statesman via AP) \nThe state has been losing a class-action lawsuit over long-term foster care. U.S. District Judge Janis Graham Jack tentatively has nudged the state to expand CPS conservatorship workers' options for placing kids by expanding capacity. She is expected to include that as a requirement in a final order, which could come later this year. \nOn other topics, Schwertner's bill would require kids coming into foster care to undergo a medical evaluation within three business days; make the department to use predictive analytics and \"geo-mapping\" to target the state's limited prevention dollars on zip codes where child maltreatment is likeliest; let the Health and Human Services Commission ask state universities to conduct scientific evaluations of unproven prevention programs; and require private contractors' workers to be trained in how to recognize whether a youth is a sex-trafficking victim. \nIn December, Schwertner pre-filed his bill and asked Gov. Greg Abbott to designate it an emergency item this session. The designation lets lawmakers act upon legislation within the first 60 days of the session. In his state of the state speech last month, Abbott made child protection issues one of four emergency items.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:20:34.482+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
