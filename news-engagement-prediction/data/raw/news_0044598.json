Source: Facebook/Mimosa Wines Waitress drags massive goanna from South Coast restaurant \nSamia Lila was serving at Mimosa Winery’s when the unwanted diner scaled along the restaurant floor, prompting her to drag it by the tail without hesitation. \n“I looked at it and thought it was a dog at first!” Ms Lila told Fairfax Media. \n“But then I realised it was a goanna… I wasn’t scared, I like reptiles so was a bit excited.” The 25-year-old French waitress didn't hesitate in dragging the reptile from the restaurant. Source: Facebook The goanna put up a decent fight as customers watched on in disbelief. Source: Facebook \nThe 25 year old initially blocked the reptile with a chair but with nervous diners becoming increasingly agitated, she employed a technique she had heard from her boss. \n“Everyone was screaming, so I started screaming too!” Ms Lila added. \n“I was just like a kid; I thought ‘I want to do it, I want to do it, I know it’s bad, but it was getting close to customers’.” \nHer boss and winery owner, Glenn Butson, had previously told Ms Lila of his own encounter with a goanna - a story that obviously resonated with the French native. Diners weren't quite as brave as Ms Lila, standing on the tops of their chairs, watching the French native go to work. Source: Facebook \n“I recently told her a story about a goanna trapped in our shower and how I picked it up by the tail and carried it outside,\" Mr Butson told the Courier Mail. \n“She just thought that’s what Aussies do when a goanna comes inside.” \nThe raw footage shared on Facebook has been viewed nearly 200,000 times since it was shared on Saturday.
