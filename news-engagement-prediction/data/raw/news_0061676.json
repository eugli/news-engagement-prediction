Explore the hidden corners, the shady past, and the many quirks of this New York City landmark. 1. The Grand Central Whispering Gallery \nThe \"whispering gallery\" or \"whispering wall\" is located on the Grand Central Terminal dining concourse near the famous Oyster Bar & Restaurant . Here, the acoustics of the low ceramic arches can cause a whisper to sound like a shout. Sound impossible? To test it out, you and a friend will have to stand in opposite corners of the large arched entryway. Now face the corner and whisper. Your friend should be able to hear your voice as if you were right next to them, not whispering into a faraway corner.According to experts, this happens because the whisperer’s voice follows the curve of the domed ceiling. The Whispering Gallery is a popular spot for marriage proposals – and a unique place to whisper sweet nothings to your main squeeze. \ncontinue reading below our video America's Best Foodie Cities 2. The Secret Passages Under Grand Central Terminal \nUnderneath Grand Central Terminal, there are secret networks of underground tracks, steam-pipe tunnels, and storage areas. Hidden in these underground depths is a train platform with a secret entrance and an elevator straight up to the Waldorf Astoria hotel.President Franklin D. Roosevelt reportedly used this as his private entry into New York City – a way to get from his train to the hotel without being bothered by reporters. Unfortunately, you can’t currently see this secret passage for yourself: The door to the secret elevator is welded shut. 3. The Grand Central Kissing Room \nThe Biltmore Room , located on the Grand Concourse across from Starbucks, was known as the “Kissing Room” during the golden age of train travel during the 1930s and 1940s. The Biltmore Room was where the famous 20th Century Limited train from the West Coast used to arrive. Passengers – including many celebrities and politicians – would get off the train and greet their loved ones here with kisses and hugs. Often, they would then go up the stairs into the famous Biltmore Hotel (now the Bank Of America building). 4. Oh My Stars \nThe ceiling over the Main Concourse , with its famous mural of the stars, is one of Grand Central Terminal’s most famous features. However, eagle-eyed visitors will notice that the zodiac on the ceiling is depicted backwards.Some have speculated that this was a mistake by the artist, Paul Helleu. The real reason, according to official documents, is that the painter was inspired by a medieval manuscript that showed the heavens as they would have been seen from outside the celestial sphere.The famous ceiling has another, more recent, secret. If you look carefully, you will see a patch of dark on the carefully restored blue of the mural. This patch shows the color of the ceiling before restoration. It was left as a reminder of how much work was done.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T19:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T12:30:15.596+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
