Zidane was asked six times regarding the treatment of Morata and Isco and their failure to feature prominently alongside the club's star-studded BBC forward trio before reaching breaking point, per ESPN FC's Dermot Corrigan: Dermot Corrigan @dermotmcorrigan Question six on Isco and Morata v BBC ... Zidane losing patience now... \"I am tired to hear myself saying same thing again and again.\" 2/28/2017, 12:23:07 PM The former Galactico was answering questions after Los Merengues salvaged a 3-2 win in their trip to El Madrigal on Sunday, where it was Morata who sealed the winning goal as his side thundered back from 2-0 down. Zidane was more generous in his responses closer to the beginning of the press conference, however, when he appeared to suggest both Morata and Isco could move this summer: Dermot Corrigan @dermotmcorrigan Zidane: \"You know what I think of Isco, Morata. They came on and did their job, like the others. What happens next year I do not know.\" 2/28/2017, 12:13:44 PM Karim Benzema, Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo make up Real's BBC attack and don't look likely to vacate any places anytime soon, leaving Morata and Isco in the dark as to where their first-team futures lie. Zidane conceded his players \" will not be happy \" if they are told they won't play, and Corrigan provided further quotes from the manager, who made it clear that an honest approach is his best route: Dermot Corrigan @dermotmcorrigan Zidane: “I speak with the player, to tell them when they will play, and when they will not. Important, always, tell them the truth.\" 2/28/2017, 12:15:13 PM Questions have been asked as to whether Morata and Isco—each of whom could garner starting spots at other top European clubs—will remain content with the idea of fighting for their places in Spain's capital. Morata was brought back to the Santiago Bernabeu last summer after Los Blancos exercised a buyback option in the contract he signed upon moving to Juventus from Madrid in the summer of 2014. Isco, meanwhile, has consistently struggled to tie down a starting place of his own in Real's midfield since joining the club from Malaga in 2013, when he was signed by then-manager Carlo Ancelotti. Some controversy erupted on Sunday after the Spanish duo were spotted joking on the sidelines while their side still trailed Villarreal, although Zidane made it clear the standard of play on the field is all he's concerned with: Dermot Corrigan @dermotmcorrigan Zidane on Isco and Morata joking on bench \"Did you see later how they came onto the pitch? So perfect, that is what is important to me.” 2/28/2017, 12:09:42 PM With another four months until the summer transfer window opens, there's a good chance Zidane will encounter more of the same line of questioning in the foreseeable future. That being said, it doesn't look as though the Frenchman will alter his approach to the situation at all, regardless of how much media pressure he may encounter.
