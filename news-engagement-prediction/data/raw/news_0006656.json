Mixing the slow, tinny beats with the gloomy, basement sounds of U.K. dubstep and grime, U.K. trap shines as the Southern rap and dance genres' broodier little brother. \nNew Zealand-born, England-based Hucci is one example of the U.K.'s dark tweaks. His latest single “Life” cuts vocal samples from hustle king 50 Cent and jam queen Beyoncé around a dark, sludgy trap beat. In an emailed statement, Hucci says he's “striving to make some innovative stuff this year.” It's the first taste of things to come, a sample of the sound fans will hear on his forthcoming LP, inspired partly by his big year of touring in 2016. \nFans can also look forward to Hucci's first merch drop, a line of streetwear in collaboration with Veyron Arche, coming Feb. 14, just in time for your girl or boy of the hour who can't get enough of that bass.
