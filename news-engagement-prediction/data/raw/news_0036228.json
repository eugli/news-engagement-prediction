He developed a crush on Amanda and drunkenly confessing his crush to her.\n“I dropped my job working with paralysed clients in a gym setting and now work as a social worker for persons with developmental disabilities,” Amanda said. \n“I admire Todd for the struggles he’s been through and hardship he now faces with being in a wheelchair and unable to walk. He is in constant pain from his injury, yet finds a way to put on a happy face in order to love me and others well.”\nTodd set up a pregnancy announcement shoot after they discovered she was pregnant even after doctors had told them it would be near impossible. He also surprised her with a proposal during the shoot.\nAmanda Diesen and Todd Krieg in the pregnancy photo that went viral.
