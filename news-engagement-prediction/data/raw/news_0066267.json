It’s dense, hard to understand and sometimes seems pointlessly convoluted. Yet for the most part, when we encounter confusing rules or loopholes, we know they exist for a legitimate reason.\nThe carried interest loophole — from which many of America’s wealthiest individuals save millions every tax year — does not fall into that category.\nCarried interest gets its name from the tradition of ship captains taking a “cut” of the profits from the sale of the cargo they carried. These captains risked their lives in treacherous and pirate-infested waters carrying goods to distant markets.\nFast-forward several centuries. “Carried interest” today refers to a tax loophole that allows investment managers’ share of profits to be taxed at the capital gains rate, 15% to 20%, instead of as ordinary income, which at a maximum rate of 35% could more than double their federal tax bill.\nYet these shares of profits are nothing more than negotiated risk-free management fees, and they should be taxed as such.\nToday’s beneficiaries of carried interest may think they’re following in the tradition of the ship captains of old, but they are far removed from taking any personal risk since they’re not putting any of their own money on the line.\nWe are firm believers in the merit of rewarding investors who provide investment capital. Our economic system functions only because people are willing to take risks and invest in enterprises, and taxing their capital gains at a responsible lower rate than ordinary income is a reasonable and fair method of encouraging such activity.\nBut there is no rationale at all for taxing any portion of the management fees that investment managers receive as capital gains. Any gains or profits earned on invested money of their own should of course also be taxed as capital gains — but absolutely not the no-risk management fees which they earn, in whatever form.\nOnly a few thousand elite investment managers in the whole of the country benefit from carried interest taxation, and roughly a third of them live and work in New York State. These millionaire managers, some making tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars a year, pay a much lower tax rate than every other manager of a business or enterprise in New York. This at a time when our state desperately needs higher tax revenues for infrastructure, better schools and other necessities.\nThere is no defensible reason why a few hundred investment managers who earn in the aggregate $3 billion to $4 billion a year should have a combined state and federal tax of only about 29%.\nClosing the carried interest tax loophole overall is a federal matter requiring action by Congress. Yet even though this much needed and much overdue fix to the tax code is supported by Democrats and Republicans alike, even though it’s been supported by Presidents Barack Obama and now Trump, the immense lobbying power of the rule’s supporters has left any attempts in Congress at reform dead on arrival.\nNew York State can’t on its own close the carried interest loophole for Congress, but while waiting, it can advance a partial correction targeting those investment managers working and living in our state.\nResponsible New York lawmakers have recently proposed a law that would close the gap between what these investment managers should pay and what they do pay — by introducing a 19% “carried interest fairness fee” on money managers currently exploiting the rule.\nThis law would go into effect only if similar bills are adopted in New Jersey, Massachusetts and Connecticut, which is necessary in order to stop these managers from moving across adjacent state lines in order to keep paying unfairly low taxes.\nUsing conservative estimates, the proposed fairness fee would raise an estimated $3.5 billion a year for our state. That’s $3.5 billion each year for affordable housing, jobs creation, health care improvements, better schools and much needed infrastructure. It very well could be $3.5 billion we need if we face federal cuts.\nIt’s past time for more tax fairness in our country, and it’s beyond past time for the demise of the grossly unfair carried interest tax rule.\nKlein represents the Bronx and parts of Westchester County in the state Senate.
