Demonetization, announced by PM Narendra Modi on November 8, did not have any impact on international trips to and from India in the October-December, 2016, quarter. \n\nThese three winter months - which happen to be the peak inbound months for travel to India - saw the maximum international travel in all the four quarters last year. Thanks to a robust inflow of 71.7 lakh international flyers, the overall foreign travel (arrivals plus departures) in the October-December quarter, 2016, was 1.38 crore - up 10.4% from 1.25 crore in the same quarter previous year (2015). \n\n\"There was no impact of demonetization 40,000 feet above sea level. People who had to travel, travelled. The numbers show that there were no cancellations due to the November 8 announcement,\" said Manoj Chacko, CEO business travel at SOTC. \n\nKaran Anand of travel major Cox & Kings also said that people did not change their travel planes due to the demonetization. \n\n\"It (banning of old notes of 500 and 1,000) has not impacted the big organised travel industry players. We have constantly seen buoyancy in outbound travel quarter over quarter,\" Anand said. India saw 5.3 crore international travellers in 2016, up 10.4% from 4.8 crore recorded in the previous year. \n\nTOI had on January 25 estimated international travel to be at 5.2 crore last year. Domestic air travel had grown 23.2% in 2016 over 2015 with almost 10 crore people taking to the skies last year. Demonetization has so far neither impacted domestic, nor international flying. \n\nWhile metro airports (except choked Mumbai) see increase in international flights, foreign airlines are now increasingly linking secondary cities directly to their hubs abroad. This is especially true for airlines of neighbouring regions like Gulf and Southeast Asia. Last year (2016) saw the Jet-Etihad combine carrying over a crore passengers in and out of India, with the Air India-AI Express combine behind at 88 lakh. \n\nEmirates remained the single largest foreign airline with a traffic of 54.6 lakh. It is desperately seeking more flying rights to India to add capacity and increase its market share under its \"organic growth\" theory even as neighbouring Abu Dhabi's \"inorganic growth\" via equity partnership with Jet is yielding significant results in India. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:35:23.495+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
