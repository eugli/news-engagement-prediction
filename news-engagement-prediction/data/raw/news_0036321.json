Due to the advanced taping schedule at \"Days,\" Irizarry should continue to air well into 2017. \nIrizarry joined Days of our Lives on January 18, 2016 as Victor Kiriakis' long forgotten brother Deimos Kiriakis. Deimos came to Salem seeking revenge against Victor, who let him serve decades in prison for a crime he didn't commit. His character was an over-the-top villain who became despised by most of Salem after he poisoned Maggie Horton Kiriakis, who ended up paralyzed again due to his scheme. In time the character was softened and fell in love with Nicole Walker. He even earned his family's trust and forgiveness. However recently he has flipped back to being a villain and is set on getting his hands on a hacking tool known as the Orwell Device. His desire to own it has led to a war with the DiMera family along with the Hernandez clan. \nIrizarry is an excellent actor, having been nominated three times for a Daytime Emmy and winning for Best Supporting Actor in 2009. However the writing for Deimos hasn't been up to par. The flip-flopping of his character from villain to somewhat-hero and then back, along with the fact that his love interest Nicole Walker is putting Deimos before her own daughter Holly, hasn't set well with fans. It was recently announced that former General Hospital head writer Ron Carlivati is taking over writing at Days , and Irizarry's departure could simply be due to a regime change. \nSoaps.com will keep you updated as more information becomes available.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:53:34.483+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
