Yeah, that was last August! What a great time that was for everybody. Anyway, I want you to forget about what you saw , because dancing pokémon are over. Here is your new bust-a-move meme, Dancing Winnie The Pooh. I’ve capped his entire title here to emphasis how important this is.\nThe original video was published on YouTube January 25th, 2015 , and features the honey-loving, bumbling bear breaking it down to a “Gangnam Style” remix. Since the video’s creation, Twitter has picked up the misshapen mustard ball and run with it. An account called @WinnieDancing remixes the video (and takes requests!!) to different songs.\nRae Sremmurd - Black Beatles pic.twitter.com/nyupZZUBzo \n— Winnie Dancing To (@WinnieDancing) January 30, 2017 There are more parody accounts to be found, though they have smaller follower counts. @WinnieDancingTo started off strong with a version of Panda’s “Desiigner.” Another called @Dancing_Winnie is here for your joke needs too, though its videos are persistently set to Pitbull’s “Hotel Room Service.” \nMe when my crush texts me back #dancingwinnie pic.twitter.com/rbzULWwBz6 \n— Dancing Winnie (@Dancing_Winnie) January 30, 2017 Dancing Winnie the Pooh isn’t the prettiest of memes. He has a wicked brow structure, and he looks like he’s been molded out of expired Play-Doh. His moves get repetitive fast. The meme has been compared, rightly so , to that creepy dancing baby that was popular in 1999. But there’s something sort of charming about watching a childhood icon fist pump his stubby limbs to Nicki Minaj’s “Anaconda,” Cascada , and one of the Wii’s menu themes . \nAt the time of publish, the Dancing Winnie meme has entered the life-cycle stage where serious verified accounts have begun to catch on. Just check out this DC Police Department account getting in on the joke, which feels about the same as the time my dad started reciting Pitbull lyrics to impress me and my teenage friends. \nWhen you see police sirens in your rear view but the person behind you gets pulled over & not you: pic.twitter.com/bPvIuMjX2V \n— DC Police Department (@DCPoliceDept) January 31, 2017 I bet my dad would like the @Dancing_Winnie account.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T00:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:57:31.934+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
