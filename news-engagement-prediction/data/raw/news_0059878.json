Adlene Guedioura was enticed to join Boro by former team-mate George Boateng Middlesbrough midfielder Adlene Guedioura says Saturday's trip to Selhurst Park, to face his old club Crystal Palace, is a \"six-pointer\" in their battle against relegation. \nGuedioura, 31, played 19 games for the Eagles between September 2013 and September 2015 before joining Watford. \nHe joined Boro from the Hornets during the January transfer window. \n\"I have nothing to prove to them, but for sure I'm thinking about three points,\" Guedioura told BBC Tees. \nThe Algeria international added: \"It's a six-point game really. When you play the teams around you, you have to win because you can take an advantage and start a good run. \n\"We need to go with a positive mind. We will go there with confidence.\" \nSince joining Boro, Guedioura has made two substitute appearances in the Premier League.
