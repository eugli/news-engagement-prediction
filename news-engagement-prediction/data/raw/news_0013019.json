It’s not something I would allow on a Twitter account now. It’s a learning curve. \n“I don’t regret being with a mate…the hashtag was ‘is it ok?’. I wasn’t saying that it’s ok. I wasn’t condoning the question.” \nBroughan said he initially considered standing as an independent in the by-election, caused by the resignation of Labour’s Tristram Hunt, but decide against it when Nuttall was announced as Ukip’s candidate as “I thought it would be ridiculous to split the vote.” \nHe added: “I still have a lot of contacts within the party. When I really started to throw myself into it was Friday night when I met up with Paul in a pub locally and we had a chat.” \nBroughan said Nuttall was “well aware of the background” of his involvement with Ukip but was happy for him to help out in the by-election. \nThis afternoon, both Nuttall and Ukip MEP Patrick O’Flynn claimed not to recognise Broughan as he walked past them into the party’s HQ wearing a purple rosette. \nUkip are yet to provide a comment to Huff Post UK on Broughan’s activities.
