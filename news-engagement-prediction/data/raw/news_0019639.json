(Photo: Jerry Holt, AP) \nSAN FRANCISCO — As IBM and Oracle remain absent from more than 120 tech companies that have filed a legal brief opposing President Trump's travel ban, momentum behind a petition of IBM employees — also against 45 — is gaining steam. \nMore than 1,550 people — a vast majority of them employees — have signed an online petition beseeching IBM CEO Ginni Rometty to reconsider aligning closely with the Trump Administration. Rometty, who wrote a letter advocating \"new-collar\" jobs to Trump in November, is a member of the president's business council. \nUber CEO Travis Kalanick dropped out of that same council last week in protest over the ban, which has drawn the ire of nearly every significant tech company in the USA — from Apple to Uber. The 127 companies on the immigration amicus brief \nElon Musk remains on the business council, but two of his companies, Tesla Motors and SpaceX, signed the amicus brief. \n\"IBM should know better, and rethink its role in the world,\" says Elizabeth Wood, 31, who resigned in November as a senior content strategist in marketing at Big Blue after Rometty's letter. \"Everyone is signing that (anti-travel ban) brief but them and Oracle.\" \nPetition organizer Daniel Hanley, a security-software engineer at IBM in Atlanta, plans to present the swelling petition to IBM management soon. \nWood, who's now freelancing in New York, is among the first in a growing wave of tech workers who are organizing and taking to the streets against Trump. The political awakening now taking place in Silicon Valley was alive and well several months ago, across the country, when Wood took a stand and resigned in protest. Tech's latest start-up: Anti-Trump activism \nShe left, she says, because she considered Rometty's association with Trump an affront to IBM's stance on inclusion, which included opposition to a Muslim registry and an anti-LGBT law in North Carolina. \"Sometimes you have to fight for what's right,\" says Wood, who's received dozens of messages and calls of support from IBMers. \nEvidently, what she started is catching on throughout the industry. \nFollow USA TODAY San Francisco Bureau Chief Jon Swartz @jswartz on Twitter.
