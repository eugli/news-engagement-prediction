'Robbed future' \nOwen's mother, Suzanne Richards, also speaking at the inquests into the British deaths, said her eldest son had been \"robbed\" of his future at just 19. \nJoel Richards, from Wednesbury, was a football referee. He was killed alongside 29 other British holidaymakers on 26 June 2015 at the resort near Sousse.
