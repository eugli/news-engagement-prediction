By: IANS | New Delhi | Updated: February 23, 2017 11:14 am Kalki Koechline at the press conference of Mantra The Movie. (Varinder Chawla) \nKalki Koechlin, who will be seen in the upcoming film ‘Mantra’, says the film is relevant for the 1990s generation. \nSpeaking at the trailer launch of the film on Wednesday, the actress said: “I liked the script. It is about how we changed when multinationals kicked off into the Indian market in 1991. While the older generation was quite traditional, the new generation wanted freedom.” \n“As I have grown up in this time so I can understand this rebellious face. I think the film is a relevant subject for a lot of our generation,” she told to media persons. \nMore from the world of Entertainment: \n\nThe film was inspired by the takeover of an iconic Indian brand by a multinational. Kapil Kapoor played by Rajat Kapoor, the owner of King Chips, was fighting a losing battle against the multinational giant, Kipper Crisps. \nHowever, Kapil’s wife and his three children are also fighting their own difficult battles in a time of turbulence. \nAlso read | Directors consciously making socially relevant films: Kalki Koechlin \nKalki, whose last outing as an actor was Waiting with Naseeruddin Shah , is playing the role of Kapil’s daughter.
