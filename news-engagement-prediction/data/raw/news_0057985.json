A little lean forward was all World War II veteran Orville Rogers needed to clinch victory. \nJust look at how close the two sprinters get at the end of the race earlier this week at the USATF Masters Indoor Track & Field Championships. \nRogers told Runners World he was visualizing the win, a technique he uses to guide his competitive spirit. \n\"That’s still my objective: I train hard and I visualize crossing the finish line out in front. And I work at it pretty consistently. It’s very rewarding to be able to accomplish what you set out to do,\" Rogers said. \nAs for his younger competitor, well Dixon Hemphill thinks he can get Rogers next time if he practices enough. \n“I know I can improve for the future,” Hemphill told the magazine. “There is training that I am not doing that I should.” \nWords to live by.
