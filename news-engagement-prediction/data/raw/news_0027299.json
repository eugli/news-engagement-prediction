The Braves’ top-rated farm system is deep in pitching and those two weren’t considered prospects or expected to compete for spots on the opening day roster.\nThe Braves wouldn’t comment on the status of Rodriguez, other than to offer their support for the wellbeing and recovery of the player and his family. Fox Sports’ Ken Rosenthal reported he would miss three to five months, but another person familiar with the situation said there was a chance Rodriguez could miss the entire season.\nRodriguez, before his injury, would’ve been the primary second baseman to start the season while prospect Ozzie Albies continued his development at Triple-A. Phillips is now expected to handle second-base duties, with Jace Peterson also getting some starts at the position and serving in a utility role.\nPhillips will be the primary second baseman, at least until Albies is ready, perhaps at some point during the 2017 season. A three-time former All-Star and four-time former Gold Glove winner, Phillips also won a Silver Slugger award in 2010 when he set career-highs in average (.300), OBP (.353) and doubles (38).\nHe was a “30-30” player in 2007 when he set career highs in homers (30) and stolen bases (32).\nThe Reds tried for the past year to trade Phillips, who reportedly rejected deals to at least two teams — the Nationals and Diamondbacks — last season and also vetoed a trade to Atlanta in November.\nPhillips, 35, had no-trade rights as a player with at least 10 years of service, including five with his current team. Now that he’s with the Braves, his contract reverts to its original partial no-trade clause, which lists 12 teams he can’t be traded to.\nThe Braves don’t issue no-trade clauses and haven’t since 1991, when John Schuerholz became general manager. They make no exceptions and didn’t give no-trade clauses to Hall of Fame pitchers Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz or future Hall of Famer Chipper Jones.\nHowever, all teams are obligated to honor the contracts of players they trade for, so the Braves will honor Phillips’ 12-team no-trade clause and also agreed to pay a $500,000 assignment bonus if they trade him in 2017.\nHe had nagging injuries in 2016, but nothing to prevent Phillips from passing a physical exam that was required before the trade was finalized and announced Sunday afternoon.\nPhillips will be a fill-in for at least the first part of the season for Rodriguez, injured in a serious accident last month that required his wife and two of their children to be hospitalized. His wife sustained a broken tibia and femur and had wrist surgery.\nOn his Twitter account, Phillips, who has kept a home in Atlanta, hinted that a trade to was already done when he posted at 10:47 p.m. Saturday: “What a day lol! #BackInDaTrap #ATLien”\nA graduate of Redan High School in Stone Mountain, Phillips has a .275 career average, 197 home runs, 198 stolen bases and a .320 OBP in 15 seasons with Cleveland and Cincinnati, the past 11 spent with the Reds. Phillips and the Reds had a relationship that had become strained, to say the least. He’s entering the final season of a six-year, $72.5 million contract.\nThe Braves would have given up more in the proposed November deal for Phillips, who was expendable for the rebuilding Reds despite showing again last season he could still be quite productive offensively; his .736 OPS was his highest since his .750 in 2012, when Phillips finished 13th in the MVP balloting.\nCoincidentally, former Braves infield prospect Jose Peraza is one of the younger Reds who stands to get more playing time now that Phillips has been traded. The Reds wanted to turn the page and play younger players as they rebuild.\nAfter Phillips vetoed the trade to the Braves in November, the Braves moved on and signed Rodriguez soon after, seemingly ending the pursuit of the Reds second baseman. But that situation changed with the Rodriguez injury.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T11:27:35.681+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
