(AP) \nRumor the German shepherd took home Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club on Tuesday. \nRumor became the second German shepherd to win the top dog prize, joining the fittingly named Manhattan in 1987. Rumor briefly retired after finishing as just a finalist in last year’s show. \nRumor was the nation's No. 1 show dog last year when she came to Madison Square Garden. But she fell short when a German shorthaired pointer named CJ won in a surprise, and it was thought that it would be Rumor’s last competition. However, she returned a month ago to give it another try. \nThe 5-year-old dog Rumor is name for the Adele hit song “Rumor has It.” This was the 104tht career win for Rumor, and handler and co-owner Kent Boyles said earlier in the day that this would definitely be her last show. \nRumor beat out the favored Preston to win her group on Monday. \nThere were nearly 2,800 dogs entered in the 141st Westminster canine competition, spread across the 202 eligible breeds and varieties. \nRumor beat out a Norwegian elkhound, a Pekingese, a miniature poodle, an Irish setter, a boxer and a Norwich terrier in the final ring. \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
