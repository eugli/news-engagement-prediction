Dafne Gutierrez went blind in her right eye in 2012 and lost vision in the other in November 2015. Doctors diagnosed the woman, who hails from Phoenix in Arizona, with benign intracranial hypertension â€“ a condition where pressure in the brain mounts for no obvious reason and can damage optical nerves. Dafne Gutierrez went blind in her right eye in 2012 and lost vision in the other in November 2015 The mother of three was told by her doctor that her affliction was 'irreversible' and that she would never be able to see again. Despite the crushing diagnosis Gutierrez remained hopeful she would regain her sight, with the ability to see her young children's faces again the main motivation. 'For me, I was like, 'Please God, let me see those faces again. Let me be their mother again.' Because I feel like (my kids) were watching me, taking care of me 24-7,' Gutierrez told WNCT . Gutierrez prays on the St. Charbel relic at the church. Days later she could see again. St. Charbel was Maronite monk and priest from Lebanon. He died 1898 and was canonized in 1977 She took her prayers to St. Joseph Maronite Catholic Church in Phoenix after learning that relics of Saint Charbel, a Lebanese monk, would be visiting the small church. The 31-year-old said her body felt different immediately after she prayed to the relics and she returned the following day for Sunday mass when she experienced a similar feeling. The next morning she said she woke up in pain and that her eyesight started to return, being able to see shadows initially. Gutierrez said: 'I was just wiping my eyes, and I'm like, 'They burn! They burn!'' On January 21 2016, three days later, doctors confirmed her eyesight was completely restored and that they couldn't provide a medical explanation as to why. Dr. Anne Borik, an internist who reviewed Gutierrez's case said when benign intracranial hypertension causes blindness it is unlikely that eyesight will return.
