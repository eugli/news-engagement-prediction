Close PM criticises Super Fund boss's huge salary increase UP NEXT VIDEO Prime Minister Bill English has criticised the huge salary increase given to NZ Super Fund boss Adrian Orr, and he's hinted at consequences for board members. Source: Fairfax. PM criticises Super Fund boss's huge salary increase \nIt's just been revealed Mr Orr was given a 36 per cent pay increase last year, taking his salary to more than $1 million. \nThat's on top of a 22 per cent hike two years earlier, and makes him New Zealand's highest-paid public servant. \nMr Orr's latest pay increase was revealed in documents obtained by Fairfax under the Official Information Act. \nMr English says he's disappointed and the salary increase will be \"taken into account\" when the board members come up for re-appointment. \nThe documents show that when he was finance minister, Mr English told the board an increase of just 2.5 per cent would be more appropriate. Mr English says he's disappointed. Source: Getty. \n\"The government has a view, the board has taken a different view,\" he said at his post-cabinet press conference on Monday. \n\"I think any board that takes a different view, when it is a 100 per cent subsidiary, takes risks about tenure and that will be discussed when the appointments come up.\" \nMr English acknowledged that Mr Orr and the board had done a good job with the Super Fund's investments, and that too would be taken into account. \n\"But they are public entities, and the government has a view about remuneration increases.\" Mr English acknowledged that Mr Orr and the board had done a good job. Source: Getty. \nThe prime minister also had a message for other big government organisations, saying he knew there was pressure for substantial pay increases. \nHe identified ACC, Housing NZ and the Reserve Bank. \nMr Orr is tipped as the next governor of the Reserve Bank when Graeme Wheeler ends his term in September. \n\"I think it would be better to find a more stable process for these very significant appointments, there's always a bit of an unsatisfactory haggle and it may be better to set a level at the start,\" he said. \nFIND out what people are saying about this story on our Facebook page .
