It’s almost too progressive, it’s almost paralyzing. I’m going to actually start campaigning for men who have been victims of being accused of rape when they haven’t actually done anything . \n“ We all of course gravitate towards vulnerable people and we consider that to be women and children first and foremost, which is important of course, but there’s also a lot of men who are in a vulnerable situation and politically bullied .” \nCommenting on the allegations against Assange, Anderson said: “ I think Sweden doesn’t really know what to do. \n“ When you read the actual case, and you read everything about it, there’s no crime that’s been committed, ” she added. \nAssange has been holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London since June 2012 in order to avoid extradition to Sweden. \nThe WikiLeaks chief claims Sweden’s extradition request is politically motivated and that he would be at risk of further extradition to the United States if he submits to the request.
