Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThe country's aviation chief has said a third runway at Heathrow will be good for Greater Manchester - because many people here ‘want to fly from London’. \nPlans for the new Heathrow runway were published this week by the government following months of debate and controversy. \nBut the top minister in charge of air policy claims that the £19bn expansion of Heathrow will have benefits for Manchester . \nIn an interview with the M.E.N, Lord Tariq Ahmad, the aviation minister, said the move would make it easier for Manchester passengers to reach a broader range of destinations... by connecting to London. \nHe said people living around Manchester want ‘increased options’ - to fly from Manchester or from Heathrow, which ‘offers greater connectivity internationally’.

Manchester Airport \nBut Lord Ahmad insisted Heathrow expansion would not clash with this, adding: “Airports compete and they will continue to compete in some areas, and in other areas they will complement each other, it will all be part of the UK’s offering to the world.” \nHowever, Manchester Airport say they are focussing all efforts on direct services to and from the north - adding that passengers DON’T want to fly via Heathrow, \nA spokesman said: “We know from speaking to passengers their overwhelming preference is to fly non-stop to their end destination whenever possible.” Read More Drunken dad-of-one banned from airline for LIFE after going 'purple with rage' on flight \nHe said options for those in their catchment were increasing and they aimed to attract more international routes. \nThe Heathrow consultation launch coincides with a report from Transport for the North which says there could be 60m more passengers using airports and ports in the north if the government supports links in the north. \nChris Grayling, Transport Secretary, said by backing the Heathrow runway they were sending a clear signal that ‘Britain is open for business’. \nHe added: “The National Policy Statement is a big step forward for what is one of the UK’s most important, major infrastructure projects. Now we want to hear your views on it. This is an important consultation and I encourage everybody to get involved across the country. \nThe draft document will be open to a 16-week consultation. An event on this will take place in Manchester in March before a final proposal is laid before Parliament for debate and a vote in the winter of 2017/18.
