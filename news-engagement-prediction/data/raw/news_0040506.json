LOVE IT! LOVE IT! by kbf325 I watched this with a couple friends and didn't think I would laugh as much as I did. This is a great date movie or just to be out with the girls. Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds make a great team. Can't wait till it's out so I can buy it. Sandra Bullock...is...actually funny?! by Stephen Mumbles Yes, it's been a while since we've actually seen Sandra Bullock in a successful movie, so skepticism is automatic when you first look at the cover of the movie. But I assure you that this is not time wasted watching this, it's funny and strangely heartfelt in the most unexpected ways. I'm not one for romantic comedies, since I'm a guy....but this one was a good balance, and the comedy was actually funny and not slapstick and not watered down for kiddos. Do watch if you miss seeing Sandra in a good comedy. I have a feeling another good Bullock comedy wont be in the future any time soon....catch her while you can.
