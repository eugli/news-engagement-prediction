(Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times) \nIn the wake of the Trump administration’s new guidelines on immigration enforcement, some school districts are telling their students they will be protected from raids — at the same time as they try to figure out exactly what the rules will mean for their students. \nThe Department of Homeland Security memos released this week empower immigration enforcement officers to target any of the 11 million people in the U.S. illegally. The directives call for hiring thousands more agents but do not say how officers should handle the so-called Dreamers, students who came to the U.S. without papers as young children. \nThe Los Angeles Unified School Board already had declared its schools “safe zones.” In February 2016, the board passed a resolution stating that if ICE agents try to enter schools in search of students, administrators should direct them to LAUSD headquarters. (ICE traditionally considers schools \"sensitive\" locations, so until now hasn't sought students at them.) \nChicago Public Schools this week announced a similar policy. Denver Public Schools did so last week. \nBut LAUSD officials say they aren’t sure what the new directives mean. “It seems that DHS and the administration is ramping up via these memos, but it always goes back to the very Constitutional notion” of serving all students equally, said Devora Reed, LAUSD associate counsel. “Even though there may be subsequent executive orders and subsequent memos that come out of DHS, we are still bound by that, and that’s what drives every policy decision we make.” \nEducators say the new guidelines add to an increasingly fraught cloud of fear, one that has prevented some immigrants from applying for financial aid. \n“What I’m telling the students who are asking, is `Know your rights, and stay out of trouble — you can’t be doing dumb high school student things, you have to be more careful than anybody,'” said Jane Slater, a college counselor at Sequoia High School in Redwood City.
