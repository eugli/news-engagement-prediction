His father died when he was 12 and he never got a chance to ask him about Nazism.He says a neighbor told him his dad had misgivings about Hitler in 1939. \nEver since then he has been on a mission to repair German-Jewish relations by playing on the Jewish-American soccer team the Maccabees, visiting Auschwitz with Holocaust survivors, and going to Israel several times. \nHe ruefully admits that he has Adolf Hitler to thank for his lengthy Hollywood career — because he got his start playing World War II German officers on ’60s television shows. \nBraeden does not see parallels between Hitler and President Trump, but is no fan of the administration.

America is great and has always been great and any immigrant will tell you that. \n“He grew up with a silver spoon in his mouth. What the hell does he know about it? This is a great country. Obviously there’s always room for improvement but for him to have the audacity to say, ‘I’m going to make this country great again and things are terrible.’ Who the hell is he? It’s so much bulls--- he’s selling people.” \nIn rebuke of Trump, Mattis says he has 'no issues with press' \nBraeden — who got his start as Hans Dietrich on TV’s war drama “The Rat Patrol” and also played doomed tycoon John Jacob Astor IV in “Titanic” — is furious at Trump’s enablers as well. \n“The Republican Congress under Mitch McConnell has been the most deleterious thing in America,” he opines. “If you want to clear out the swamp, you clear out the Republican Congress. They have blocked every decent thing. It infuriates me just to think about it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T07:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T02:34:58.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
