Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA paedophile with an ‘unhealthy predatory sexual appetite’ has been jailed after he was convicted of abusing two young boys at a holiday park. \nStephen Harding, 59, of Northenden Road, Sale , left one victim suffering years of depression and he tried to kill himself, a court heard. \nThe other said the assaults had a “massive effect” on his life and wished they had never happened. \nHarding denied charges of indecently assaulting the boys between November 1995 and October 2001. \nBut a jury at Caernarfon Crown Court found him guilty after a three day trial. \nSentencing Harding to four years in jail, Judge Huw Rees said Harding had an “unhealthy, predatory sexual appetite”.

He told the jury he had wanted to tell her for several years but felt he couldn’t in case he upset his family. \nHarding was later arrested and interviewed. He told officers he accepted he had a caravan on the site and knew the boy’s family but denied the allegations. \nReviewing the evidence police became aware another allegation of abuse by Harding had been made in 2007. \nThe allegations were made by the second victim who was about 12 when he was allegedly indecently assaulted by Harding in a caravan. Read More \nHarding had been interviewed and denied the allegations and the matter went no further at that stage. \nNeither complainant was aware of the other, the jury heard. \nBoth told the jury when they saw Harding after the assaults took place he was acting entirely normal as if nothing had happened. \nGiving evidence Harding denied any of the assaults had taken place. \nCross examined by prosecutor Simon Rogers he said the allegations were a “complete fabrication”. \nUrging the judge to pass the least possible jail term, defence barrister Vanessa Thomson said Harding suffered from ill-health and led a “lonely and isolated life” estranged from his family as a result of the allegations. \nIn addition to the jail sentence, the judge imposed an indefinite Sexual Harm Prevention Order . The prohibitions include no contact by any means with the two victims.
