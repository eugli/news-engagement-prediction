PHOTO | ONDARI OGEGA By PATRICK LANG’AT and JUSTUS OCHIENG \nFormer National Assembly Speaker Kenneth Marende is on Tuesday expected to announce his return to ODM and his interest in the Nairobi governor’s seat. \nMr Marende on Monday held a meeting with party leader Raila Odinga at his Bondo home before accompanying him to Kisumu to visit ailing former Kenyatta-era minister Joseph Otiende at Avenue Hospital. \nThe former Emuhaya MP was in 2008 elected to Parliament on an ODM ticket, which went on to support his election as Speaker in the House. \n“My stand is solid and I am set to make an announcement tomorrow (Tuesday) on my next move,” he said on Monday. \nBut Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa dismissed him, calling him a Jubilee project. \n“He (Marende) cannot just come and want a ticket. He might be a Jubilee project sent to split our votes to let a Jubilee candidate win. I caution our people not to be used by Jubilee this way,” said Dr Wamalwa. \n“Discussions are ongoing, but so far Dr Kidero is our formidable candidate,” he said. \nCord agreed not to field any other candidate.
