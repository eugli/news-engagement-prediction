Vote for the team you think deserves the weekly honor as much as you want until Saturday afternoon. Here's how last week's voting went . \nSunset girls swimming : The Apollos edged Metro League rival Jesuit for the Class 6A team title 203-199. Sunset sealed the win in the final event, the 400-yard freestyle relay, for 32 points to overtake the Crusaders. Jesuit didn't have an entry in the event. \nJesuit boys swimming : The Crudsaders' boys team left no doubt who was the best in the poll. They won both relay events and sophomore Trent Martinez won two events to push Jesuit to 246 points for the Class 6A boys title, far ahead of runner-up Sunset with 113. \nBend girls swimming : The Lava Bears scored 97 points to take the Class 5A swim title going away, ahead of Crescent Valley's 60 points. Elliyana Ferrin and Emily Brockman won two events each and helped two relay teams win gold. \nHillsboro boys swimming : The Spartans picked up their first-ever boys swimming championship in dramatic fashion when they claimed the 5A title 64-51 over Mountain View. Hillsboro, like the Sunset girls swim team, clinched the title with a win in the final event, the 400 freestyle relay. \nSweet Home girls swimming : The Huskies repeated as Class 4A/3A/2A/1A girls swim champions behind eight event victories, easily winning over runner-up North Bend 99-58. \nSweet Home boys swimming : The Huskies topped La Grande 68-51 in Class 4A/3A/2A/1A with a win in the 400 freestyle relay to win their 11th boys swimming championship. \nBeaverton boys basketball : The Beavers won two home games, beating Century 74-38 and Southridge 61-54, to clinch their second consecutive Metro League title. The win over Southridge avenged Beaverton’s only league loss and clinched its first back-to-back league titles since 1998, when the Beavers won the last of five in a row. Beaverton (20-4, 15-1 Metro) has a bye Tuesday, the final day of the regular season. \nBanks girls basketball : Anna Klein scored 18 points and Aspen Slifka added 14 points as Banks beat Seaside 39-30 to earn a share of the Class 4A Cowapa League title with the Seagulls. The win avenged a 62-58 loss to the Seagulls in the teams' first league meeting. \nChurchill boys basketball : The No. 3 Lancers avenged their only league loss and moved a game ahead of No. 2 Springfield in the race for the Midwestern League title with Friday’s 60-53 road win. Lucas Wilson had 22 points and 13 rebounds for Churchill, which is gunning for its sixth consecutive league championship. \nNorth Medford boys basketball : Oscar Banuelos, Kaison Faust and Tre Holmes scored 12 points apiece to help the No. 8 Black Tornado cruise past the host Wolverines and lock up at least a share of their first Southwest Conference title since 1999. “It’s been a long time coming,” North Medford coach Scott Plankenhorn told the Medford Mail Tribune. “I’ve been part of a lot of groups where we thought we had a chance and never got it done but I’m excited about this group that has pushed itself and locked in to get it done.” \nWilsonville boys basketball : Zach Reichle had eight of his team-high 19 points in the final period as the visiting Wildcats overcame a fourth-quarter deficit to clinch at least a share of the Northwest Oregon Conference title Friday by beating No. 5 La Salle Prep 50-46 in front of a raucous crowd in Milwaukie. The four-point margin represents Wilsonville’s closest league game this season. \nBenson girls basketball : The Techsters followed their impressive win at then-No. 3 Grant by rolling past No. 2 Clackamas 66-43 in a nonleague game on the road Monday. Tayler LyDay had 22 points, eight rebounds, six steals, two assists and four blocked shots and Ciera Ellington added 17 points, five rebounds, four assists and two steals. \nTigard girls basketball : Three nights after coming from behind to beat rival Tualatin, the Tigers did it again Friday, erasing a four-point deficit in the final minute of regulation and outlasting host Canby 63-55 in overtime. Senior wing Kylie Warren scored four of her game-high 21 points in the last minute to force overtime, making two free throws to tie with 10 seconds left. \nSutherlin girls basketball : Sutherlin hadn’t lost a league game since 2011, winning 55 in a row, before losing to Cottage Grove 52-51 on Jan. 24. The Bulldogs not only avenged the loss, but they secured their sixth consecutive league title by holding off the Lions for a 32-31 win Tuesday. Taylor Stricklin scored 16 points for Sutherlin.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T06:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T09:32:58.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
