Justin Sullivan, Getty Images \nVerizon is getting a discount for damaged goods. \nThe telecommunications giant and Yahoo have agreed to drop its original $4.83 billion acquisition deal price by $350 million, months after Yahoo's public image rolled downhill from one hacking scandal after another. \nIn the seven months since Verizon announced it was buying Yahoo's operating business , the web-pioneering site revealed it suffered the worst hack in history -- twice. It first set the record in September with 500 million accounts breached , then broke its own record in December when Yahoo revealed it had 1 billion accounts hacked in a separate breach . \nIts $4.83 billion deal had been on shaky ground since the massive breaches, but Verizon had not lost faith in Yahoo's 1 billion user base. \n\"We have always believed this acquisition makes strategic sense. We look forward to moving ahead expeditiously so that we can quickly welcome Yahoo's tremendous talent and assets into our expanding portfolio in the digital advertising space,\" Marni Walden, Verizon's executive vice president said in a statement . \nThis is a breaking news story, more to come.
