Education Dept. caves, restores website for disabled kids 1 / 4 Back to Gallery \nU.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos on Friday announced that her department is restoring and \"updating\" a resource website for parents and teachers of students with disabilities, which has been down almost three weeks. \n\" IDEA.ed.gov has been repaired and moved to a new server to ensure it's available to parents and educators who rely on it,\" DeVos said in one of a series of tweets. \nThe education secretary had come under pressure from Sens. Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, D-Wash. The senators sent DeVos a letter last week asking that the site be restored fully and immediately, and for an explanation of why it was down. \nDeVos struck a partisan note, in what has seemed to be a Trump administration strategy: Blame Obama. \nShe said the federal Individuals With Disabilities Act (IDEA) website was \"neglected for nearly four years.\" This, she said, is \"unacceptable\" and \"an example of complacency I won't accept, and I will remain committed to improving the department and its services.\" \nIn the Washington Post, on Friday, DeVos was quoted as saying critics \"want to make my life a living hell.\" \nMurray, a trenchant critic, said in a statement that the point is not political blame, but providing information to students and educators, particularly about citizens' rights under the federal disability law. \n\"I heard from parents who had been impacted by the absence of this critical resource, and I pushed Secretary DeVos to get it back up, to explain what had happened, and to make sure nothing like it happened again,\" Murray said. \n\"I am glad that the website appears to be back online, but I am going to continue monitoring this issue and working to make sure that the Department of Education is doing everything possible to protect every student and make sure they have every opportunity to learn.\" \nLong before Murray was part of the Senate's Democratic leadership, she was a preschool teacher and a member of the Shoreline School Board. \nShe led the opposition to DeVos' confirmation as ranking Democrat on the Senate Health Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. A Republican mega-donor and advocate for school vouchers, DeVos was confirmed by a 51-50 vote -- with Vice President Mike Pence breaking a tie vote in the Senate. \nRough week for the Department of Education. The confirmation of Betsy DeVos, the bill introduced to abolish it and now a tweet that indicates they need all the reform we can give them.
