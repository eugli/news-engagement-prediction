Mr. Stevenson, he added, executed his cartoons with “a perfect combination of line and wash” (diluted ink). In 1983, decades before Donald J. Trump became president, Mr. Stevenson depicted the yawning gap between wealth and poverty at the construction site of the luxurious Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue. As people walk beneath scaffolding that displays the building’s name in capital letters, an unshaven, scruffy man sits with a sign at his feet that says, “Trump Bum.” Mr. Stevenson’s tone reflected his heyday at the magazine, from the late 1950s to the mid-1980s, when William Shawn was its editor. “It was humor where voting for different people didn’t disqualify you from dating someone,” Mr. Mankoff said. “It was congenial and more benign.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story He added that Mr. Stevenson had “one complete synchronous wavelength with Shawn and Lee Lorenz,” the magazine’s former art and cartoon editor. Mr. Stevenson shifted easily from light social commentary to a silliness that often had its roots in art, current events or old jokes. One of his cartoons showed a particularly glum egg and a chicken meeting at a supermarket checkout line. Each has a shopping basket in tow. “Who’s next?” the cashier asks. Another pictured three frogs on a lily pad. One, a youngster, says, “Tell us again about Monet, Grandpa.” One of his 79 covers for the magazine showed three Cupids at mission control watching the heavenly launch of a giant arrow. “Anything that was sort of ridiculous was in his milieu,” Roz Chast, one of the magazine’s star cartoonists today, said in an interview. James Stevenson was born in Manhattan on July 11, 1929, to Harvey Stevenson , an architect who helped design the F.D.R. Drive , and the former Winifred Worcester, a homemaker. He grew up in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., and, while on his summer vacation from high school, was an office boy at The New Yorker. Photo Credit James Stevenson The summer job left him with a desire to contribute comedy to the magazine, so he started to send in gags for others artists’ cartoons through the rest of high school, from Yale University, from the Marine base in North Carolina where he served for about 18 months, and from Life magazine, where he was a reporter. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The New Yorker hired him in 1956. Mr. Shawn, he recalled, was at such a loss for something to say when they first met that he asked him, “Would you like to have a cigarette?” But Mr. Shawn could not find one, and they parted. Even while he was producing cartoons for The New Yorker, Mr. Stevenson was producing children’s books. A few, like “When I Was Nine” (1986), were stories based on his youth; some were about Emma, a young redheaded witch; others were about “The Worst Person in the World” (1995), a sour old man challenged to be better by the ugliest creature in the world. He even illustrated a book by Dr. Seuss, “I Am Not Going to Get Up Today!” (1987). Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.
