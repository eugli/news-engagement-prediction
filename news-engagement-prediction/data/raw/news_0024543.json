Young rejects that characterization. Steve Young (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 8:58 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 8:58 p.m. ET \nIs Steve Young mailing it in at ESPN? Does he work hard at the \"Monday Night Countdown\" gig that a thousand ex-NFLers would kill for? \nThose questions have been percolating since Bloomberg published a profile of the ex-49ers quarterback, who has built a second career for himself as a private equity investor. \nMORE: ESPN eyeing Charissa Thompson for Chris Berman post \nYoung, a Super Bowl champion and NFL MVP, has become a self-professed \"deal guy\" with Huntsman Gay Global Capital (HGGC). \nIf it was up to Young, he'd give up his ESPN TV gig entirely for the world of high finance, according to the story . \nVia Bloomberg: \nYoung says he may have quit ESPN years ago if not for his private equity partners, who like him to keep a high profile. When he works a Monday Night game for the network, he spends no more than an hour or two at the stadium preparing his commentary, he says; the rest of the time, he’s holed up in HGGC’s suite, cramming for deals. Once the game starts, he barely watches the action. A couple of transactions, he notes, have even been agreed to with handshakes in the suites. \n“My wife hates football, and my kids don’t really care,” Young says. “I see myself as a deal guy first. I’ve put football behind me. Roger Staubach once told me—and I’ll never forget it: ‘When you retire, run. Never look back.’ ” \nWell, now. That's interesting stuff. \nOne thing ESPN won't tolerate is ex-jocks turned TV analysts who don't put in the work. \nEspecially when there are hundreds of behind-the-scenes producers, directors and assistants working 24/7 to put a good product on the air. \nThat's probably one reason for the departure of longtime baseball analyst John Kruk , who didn't like his golf game being interrupted by phone calls from producers. \nSporting News reached out to Young and ESPN for their reactions to the Bloomberg profile. Young said in a statement that, contrary to what was written, both jobs are important to him. \n“I participated in this story to encourage athletes to think about their futures because I want to inspire them to think this way. I have worked hard to build an expertise in two different fields, and I am proud of that. I have built one over the course of 35 years as a football player and analyst. The other, in private equity, I’ve established over 18 years. I’m focused on being excellent at both — and without sacrificing one for the other,\" Young said. \"Staying connected to the game and working for ESPN are very meaningful to me. In no way did I intend to suggest otherwise.” \nMORE: Bomani Jones is one who got away from FS1 \nStephanie Druley, ESPN's senior vice president of events and studio production, said Young continues to make football fans \"smarter\" with his on-air analysis. \n“Steve is one of the most respected analysts in football and he remains committed to his job at ESPN. His producers and colleagues have noted his work ethic internally, his level of preparation and the effort he brings each week,\" Druley said in a statement to SN. \"In addition to analyzing 'Monday Night Football,' he watches games, actively participates in production meetings and contributes weekly analysis to our studio shows using a camera that ESPN installed in his office. He is one of the veterans of our analyst team and he’s constantly making fans smarter about the game.” \nSo what should we make of all this? \nSometimes ESPN analysts get themselves in trouble by talking to media who are outside the normal sports beat. \nRon Jaworski, for example, was quoted in the high-falutin' The New Yorker magazine about his then \"Monday Night Football\" partner Jon Gruden in 2011. \nOstensibly about Gruden, the only thing anybody remembered from that long profile was The New Yorker's account of Jaworski weighing how to \"sell\" a specious theory to viewers at a production meeting: \nWhen it was Jaworski’s turn, he issued a stern proclamation. “Call me crazy, but I’m really excited for Tyler Palko tonight,” he said, and a roomful of skeptical sports producers erupted in laughter. Jaworski had given himself the thankless task of building up the Chiefs, praising them as much as he could without putting his own credibility at risk. Perhaps viewers would buy into the idea, however far-fetched, that Palko would emerge as the night’s underdog hero. Later that day, as Jaworski was making a cup of coffee in the ESPN bus, he tried the line again. “Call me crazy, but I’m excited about Tyler Palko,” he said. He exhaled. “I’ve got to sell this,” he said to himself. \nDeadspin called it \"everything that's wrong with Monday Night Football, in one New Yorker paragraph.\" \nJaws never recovered. \nMORE: Michael Smith, Jemele Hill discuss new show 'The Six' \nIt wasn't long before the three-person MNF announcing team of Jaworski, Gruden and Mike Tirico became a two-person booth of Gruden and Tirico. Jaworski was the odd man out. \nOn the other hand, the hard and quick reaction by ESPN PR in this case bodes well for Young. \nIf ESPN didn't care if he was coming back, it wouldn't have responded. It seems, then, it values Young and wants to keep him. \nYoung, on the other hand, doesn't need a TV job with his Silicon Valley millions. Maybe he meant what he said to Bloomberg. \nThe political journalist Michael Kinsley once defined a \"gaffe\" as the rare moment when a politician accidentally tells the truth. Maybe Young's \"gaffe\" was admitting he's not all-in for \"Monday Night Countdown.\" \nWhich could provide an opening for ESPN analysts looking for more air time next season.
