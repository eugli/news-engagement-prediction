After winning the best pop duo/group performance, Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun immediately got up from their seats and removed their pants and walked towards the stage in the boxers to accept the awards. \nImage Credit: AP \nWhy such a crazy move? Back then, when they weren't famous and when they watched Grammys together, they watched it with only their boxers on. It is then Josh said to tyler that if they ever go to the Grammys, and if they ever win a Grammy, they would receive it just like this. \n\"This story, it starts in Columbus, Ohio, it was a few years ago and it was before Josh and I were able to make money playing music,\" he explained. \"I called him up, and I said, 'Hey Josh, want to come over to my rental house and watch the Grammys? As we were watching, we noticed every single one of us was in our underwear, and seriously, Josh said to me, and we were no one at the time, he turned to me and he said, 'If we ever go to the Grammys, if we ever win a Grammy, we should receive it just like this.'\" — Thomas |-/ (@thomasjphelps) February 13, 2017 \nStaying true to their word, they went and accepted the awards in their boxers. Tyler then went ahead and gave an inspiring message to all the budding artists - “I want everyone at home who’s watching to know that you can be next. So watch out, OK, because anyone from anywhere can do anything\", he said.
