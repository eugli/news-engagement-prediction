External Link: Tony Mitchell fires a ball at the referee \nMitchell scored 17 points off the bench in the Taipans' 74-66 loss, but was called for four fouls in 21 minutes on the floor, which he clearly was not happy with. \n\"Whether it be at the lowest level or the NBL and NBA at the professional level, referees must be protected.
