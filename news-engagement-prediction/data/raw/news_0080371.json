Jones , USA TODAY 11:33 p.m. ET Feb. 25, 2017 \nHello, Lucas! (Photo: Alberto E. Rodriguez, Getty Images) \nLucas Hedges is the first to admit he's \"still kind of a kid\" but the 20-year-old, who earned a best supporting actor nomination for his turn in Kenneth Lonergan's affecting best-picture contender Manchester by the Sea , is already thinking about how we can raise the next generation of men. And he credits Manchester with planting that seed. \nMasculinity \"is actually one of my favorite topics of discussion right now,\" he told us on the blue carpet at Saturday's Film Independent Spirit Awards , where his Manchester co-star Casey Affleck took home the award for best male lead . \"Like, how do we encourage young men to talk about what they’re feeling and really just speak their truths on a daily basis?'\" Ava DuVernay talks Oscars, inclusion and reimagining winning at Spirit Awards \nBut, while Hedges is vested in men speaking their truths, he acknowledged that there is truth in showing characters that wrestle with that. \n\"One of the great things about Manchester is I learned how mysterious grief works in our lives and that you can lose a father, (as his Manchester character did) and there’s no possible way to predict how somebody’s going to react,\" he said. \"So, that’s one thing I learned from (my director) Kenny, and the only way to do these stories justice is to (show that). The first time I auditioned for the movie, I came in with a very emotional interpretation of the scene and he said, ‘What if you just played it almost like it was a comedy?’ And I never thought of it that way ... but the truth is you just have no idea and I thought was a great lesson.\" Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T11:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T06:42:15.848+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
