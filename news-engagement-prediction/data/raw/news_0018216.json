Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nManchester City fans don't want to let the legend go, the club says they are desperate for him to stay , and the player himself claims he is happy and wants to go nowhere. \nSo exactly why will the speculation about Sergio Aguero 's future keep hanging around the club – at the very least until the summer transfer window shuts? \nCity fans are used to Aguero being linked with a move away. The stories began during his first season with the Blues, long before he cemented his iconic status with that extra-time goal to win the title. \nThe Spanish media heavily linked him with Real Madrid, claiming City had been a stopping-off post to avoid the political repercussions of moving from Atletico to their hated rivals. Speculation about Sergio Aguero's future began within days of him signing for Manchester City in 2011 \nKun himself has persistently stated his happiness at City. He enjoys the more relaxed atmosphere of Manchester, having seen the goldfish-bowl existence of his pal Lionel Messi in Barcelona. \nThe one thing that has changed is the arrival of Gabriel Jesus. \nDespite his brilliant start to life in English football, there is nothing to suggest that Aguero cannot see off the latest challenge to his number one status, the way he did with Edin Dzeko and Mario Balotelli, and has kept Kelechi Iheanacho at arm's length. Sergio Aguero saw off the challenge of Edin Dzeko \nThe Argentine will have the backing of the club's commercial bigwigs, for sure. \nThey sell the club largely on the back of his global superstar status – their marketing of City in the Far East and elsewhere hangs heavily on images of Aguero. \nAnd the fans wouldn't want him to go, either, and not just because they are clinging to nostalgia – he remains the deadliest striker in the Premier League when he is not injured, suspended or on the bench! Guardiola has picked Gabriel Jesus ahead of Sergio Aguero in the last two games \nBut the fact is that right now, Pep Guardiola prefers Jesus. \nHe has persistently urged Aguero to improve – to run more, to defend more, to be more of a link man rather than just the explosive goalscorer. \nKun has responded. His running stats have improved, but still lag a long way behind the all-action Brazilian, while Jesus already has one assist to Aguero's nil this season. \nWhether Aguero is prepared to step up his work rate is open to debate – his answer at the weekend to the question of whether he can learn from Jesus was ambivalent. \nHe said: “Yes, at the moment I have to watch what he does, to learn, it could be a little bit. I am how I am. I have spent a lot of years in Europe playing the same way.” Aguero said he can learn from Jesus \nThe first part of the answer is a big positive, the second bit sounds a little more like – this is the way I do things, take it or leave it. \nAnd of course, while Jesus' running stats are already much better, he has to prove, over a sustained period, that he can score goals at the same rate as Kun. \nBut the differences between the two men run deeper. \nGuardiola has already praised Jesus' attempts to learn English. The manager has always tried to submerge himself in the culture of the clubs and cities in which he has played and coached, and expects his players to do the same. \nAguero has been in Manchester for six and a half years and, in public at least, still barely speaks the language.

After his astonishing four-goal demolition of Spurs in 2014, goalkeeper Joe Hart revealed “He is one of those players, and I don’t think he will be unhappy with me saying it, that some days you look at him in training and he is useless!” \nFrank Lampard recently revealed that Aguero frequently showed up late for training, and happily paid the subsequent club fines, during Manuel Pellegrini's tenure at the club. \nIt is not known whether he has continued to turn up late, or been equally unimpressive, since Guardiola took over, but that would also not go down well with the perfectionist in Pep.
