Ava with her dad Damian, who said her death had been a 'nightmare' for the family \nA senior paediatric pathologist described the possibility of an ‘overlay’ situation as ‘remote’. Read More Arsonist got just what he wanted from a Spice-fuelled night of madness \nA post-mortem examination revealed no injuries, pre-existing medical conditions or abnormalities and Ava was described as a normal, happy and healthy baby. \nA cause of death was given as ‘unascertained natural cause’ and coroner Simon Nelson said baby Ava had died ‘suddenly and unexpectedly’ as the result of a ‘naturally occurring process’. \nThe inquest was told co-sleeping has been associated with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), the sudden unexplained death of a healthy baby. A memorial in Rochdale to pay tribute to 16-year-old Chloe Cockton, who died in a car crash, and Ava Rose Sharples who died on the same day \nAva however was described as being at the ‘older end of the spectrum’, although the inquest heard that sudden and unexplained deaths can occur at any age when the heart suddenly beats abnormally.

Sadly that research has not yet enabled us to achieve that.” \nSpeaking after the inquest, Ava’s dad Damian, a window cleaner, said her death had been a ‘nightmare’ for the family. \nHe said: “I blamed myself, but this brings only a slight element of closure. Ava was just brilliant and it has been a nightmare for us all. We were made to think like we had done something wrong.” Ava Rose Sharples \nMum Kylie paid tribute to ‘the bubbliest little madam ever’. “She had curly hair and little dimples on her chin,” she said. “She was absolutely beautiful and we used to call her our gift. She was very loving and very cuddly. We will always miss her like mad. She will always be a part of the family.” \nKylie fought back tears as she told the inquest how Ava had been sleeping in their bed for three or four months after recovering from bronchiolitis. She said she wouldn’t sleep in her cot.

Ava with mum Kylie, who says she was the 'bubbliest little madam ever' \nShe was asleep on her back when the couple went to bed, sleeping either side of her with a duvet covering her legs. \nKylie said: “I always gave her plenty of room to move. I fell asleep and just woke up in the morning. I kind of jolted, like I was falling out of bed. \n“I stood up and I felt something was not right. She was not poking me like she normally did. I just turned around and I knew. I screamed ‘she’s dead’, grabbed her and ran downstairs.” \nParamedics battled to resuscitate her but she was pronounced dead in hospital. Mr Nelson recorded a verdict of natural causes and told the couple: “I have no doubt at all that Ava brought special moments into your lives and you will treasure those memories.” Ava leaves sisters Kayla, 10, and Gracie, seven. 'I have no doubt at all that Ava brought special memories into your lives and you will treasure those memories' \nBaby Ava’s sudden death was one of a series of tragedies to hit the Kirkholt community last year. \nBut friends of the grieving families involved, and strangers on the Rochdale estate who didn’t know them, joined forces in tribute to offer them comfort and support. \nBalloons were released and soared high into the sky in memory of much-loved Ava at an organised vigil at which the life of 16-year-old Chloe Cockton was also celebrated. Chloe Cockton, pictured at the Parklife festival, died in a car crash in Rochdale, also in July \nChloe, 16, died in a car crash on Bury Road in Rochdale, also in July. The schoolgirl died in the arms of her sister, who was also injured in the collision, while they waited for an ambulance in the street. \nAnd in nearby Balderstone 18-year-old Talaina Hussain, who died in a car crash later in the year, was also mourned. \nAva’s mum and dad, Kylie and Damian, thanked the people of Kirkholt for their sympathy and backing. \nAn appeal on the Just Giving website raised more than £2,000 so Damian, who is self-employed, could grieve with his family and children at home after his daughter’s death without worrying about money. Speaking after the inquest, Ava’s mum Kylie said: “There have been tragedies on Kirkholt but we want to say a big thanks to everyone, our friends and out family for their support.” What the experts say about sleeping with your baby... \nThe National Childbirth Trust (NCT) said recommendations about co-sleeping were updated in 2014. \nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) said that although Sudden Infant Death Syndrome was rare, it happens more often when parents or carers sleep with a baby. \nThe Infant Sleep Information Source however said the new guidance amounted to a downgrading of the relationship between co-sleeping and SIDS from a ‘risk’ to an ‘association’. \nWatch: The National Childbirth Trust respond to report on parents and babies sleeping together Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now \nThere is widespread agreement over a lack of clear evidence that co-sleeping causes SIDS, although it is said to increase the risk. There is evidence however that it is more dangerous to fall asleep with a baby on a sofa or a chair. \nThe Lullaby Trust, which provides specialist support for bereaved families, promotes advice on safer baby sleeping and raises awareness over sudden infant death, said bed sharing was ‘particularly dangerous’ if parents smoke, if they have taken alcohol, drugs or medication, or if they are simply overly tired. \nThe Trust said co-sleeping with a baby of low birth weight, or a premature baby, was strongly linked to increased risks. \nParents however may still choose to share a bed with their baby. It is their choice to make. The Lullaby Trust’s recommendations are to ensure there are no pillows, sheets, blankets or any other items that could obstruct a baby’s breathing or cause them to overheat. \nBabies should be placed to sleep on their backs in a separate Moses basket or cot in the same room for the first six months. \n•For bereavement support call the Trust on 0808 802 6868 or for general advice and information, 0808 802 6869.
