Sad!” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. \nWith Congress on recess, some Republican lawmakers such as Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa are confronting heated complaints at meetings at home, where some people are voicing loud opposition to the GOP’s plans to repeal Obamacare and other of Mr. Trump’s initiatives. \nGOP Reps. Tom McClintock of California and Gus Bilirakis of Florida are among the House lawmakers who have faced demonstrators at meetings in their districts.
