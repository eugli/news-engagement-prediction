But he wasn’t much help. \n“We only get four tickets for each player, so my mom had people buy tickets,” Irvin said. “So I think I’ve got 50-60 people coming. The Irvin gang, they roll in strong. I’ll probably be able to hear them when they’re yelling. \n“They’ll probably get there way before the game. It’ll be a good moment for my family.” \nIrvin will be among the five Michigan players honored on senior night Saturday, just before the Wolverines take on No. 14 Purdue (4 p.m., ESPN2). \nHis father, James, known to many as “Big Irv,” admitted he’ll probably get emotional. That’s what happened during his son’s senior night four years ago at Hamilton Southeastern High School, near their Fishers, Ind., home. All the work and sacrifice rose to that moment for the family to embrace. \n“That’s just me, I’m an emotional person,” James said. “Zak plays with emotion. But that’s part of the game. Plus they’re playing Purdue.” \nRelated: Spike Albrecht returns for second Crisler Senior Day — for Purdue \nMichigan coach John Beilein used to worry when a team from Indiana popped on the schedule, as Irvin often would get too amped up to face an in-state team. But Irvin has matured as he motored up the career record books at Michigan. He could finish in the top 20 all-time in points scored, top five in three-pointers and second all-time in games played. \nSaturday's pregame senior ceremony will be short, but those 50-60 friends will relish celebrating Irvin's success. Many wondered if he’d reach his senior year at Michigan. Weight of the crown \nIrvin knew expectations would follow him after being named Indiana’s Mr. Basketball in 2013. \nSix of the seven previous winners were drafted into the NBA, including five in the first round and five who declared early for the draft. \nHe hoped to be the next, coming out of high school a year after close friend Gary Harris, another Indiana Mr. Basketball who played two years at Michigan State before entering the NBA draft . \nBut Irvin's career took a different path. The twists and turns helped him build confidence, and he feels secure entering the final weeks of his college career. \n“It was definitely challenging at first, just because of how young I was,” Irvin said. “As a freshman it was kind of tough to deal with. But as the years have gone on, I’ve been able to mature. Everyone has a different path to where they want to go. Those are my dreams and ambitions to play in the NBA, but right now I’m taking it day by day.” \nMichigan was coming off a Final Four run when Irvin joined the program in 2013-14. Sophomores Nik Stauskas and Caris LeVert were ahead of him on the depth chart, eventually carrying U-M to the Big Ten title. Irvin’s role was to come off the bench and shoot, which he did well, hitting 43% of his three-point shots. \nMore U-M senior day coverage: A chance meeting brought Sean Lonergan to Michigan \nIrvin \"didn’t want to just be a three-point shooter.” His role expanded as a sophomore after LeVert and now senior Derrick Walton Jr. suffered midseason foot injuries. He made progress and eventually thrived, winning team MVP honors. But the season ended with a thud and without a postseason berth. \nHis junior year should have been a launching point, but a summer back injury and surgery that fall but wiped it out. The months of rehap kept him from returning to his old self, even though he started 34 of 35 games. \nThere was optimism entering this season. He was finally healthy and became U-M's most consistent player until late January, when flu-like symptons hindered him for few games. \nHis scoring production dipped significantly, but he wasn't fazed like when he was younger. \n“Just maturing, as you get older, you learn,” he said. “I relied (early) so much on my offense or my jump shot to control how I played for the whole game. One of the most powerful things I heard was my freshman to sophomore year from coach (LaVall Jordan). He told me there’s a different between playing well and shooting well. \n“That really resonated with me. I know when the game isn’t going well, I can change the game in different areas.” \nThat happened a year ago against Purdue, when Irvin held forward Caleb Swanigan to 14 points and four rebounds but also scored 22 points in the 61-56 win. He was even more of a factor as Michigan pushed its way into the NCAA tournament, repeatedly making late-game shots. \n“To me, that’s just in you,” James said. “He just wants to win. It’s all about winning. No matter if he scores two points or 25 points.” \nFeb 22, 2017; Piscataway, NJ, USA; Michigan Wolverines guard Zak Irvin drives against Rutgers Scarlet Knights center C.J. Gettys during the first half at Louis Brown Athletic Center. (Photo: Noah K. Murray, USA TODAY Sports) Accepting his place \nIrvin has grown in all aspects of life. \nHis faith always has been the avenue from which he handles adversity – forced to the junior varsity team as a high school freshman, overlooked as a Mr. Basketball favorite as a senior, getting limited minutes early at Michigan, then the back injury. \nIrvin doesn’t have many tattoos, but the inside of his wrists reveal everything about his perspective. In cursive writing, one reads “Let Go” and the other “Let God.” \n“He’s still a silly guy, but he’s serious about what he needs to do and that makes the team a lot better,” Walton said. “He has a laser-like focus knowing that what he’s doing and what he says carries so much weight. So you can say he’s matured really well over the last couple years.” \nIrvin and Gary Harris still speak often. Harris shares tales of life with the Denver Nuggets, and encourages Irvin to work and join him. \nIrvin's support system, from Harris to Walton to Beilein and his father, always has the same message: Embrace your path. They'll be out in full force to see him do that on Saturday. \nContact Mark Snyder: msnyder@freepress.com. Follow him on Twitter @mark__snyder .
