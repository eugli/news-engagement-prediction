The order are preparing to battle the mythical Tao-Tie – giant, green, lizard-y looking monsters that are resurrected every 60 years to teach the Chinese a lesson about unchecked greed and swarm the wall in their millions.\nCommander Lin (the film’s sole speaking female character, played by Jing Tian) takes a shine to William, pointing out their similarities. However, though both are dab hands with a bow, the two fight for different reasons; he for food and money, she for trust and honour, a lesson William inevitably learns by the film’s conclusion (perhaps making an oversimplified case for Chinese communism).\nDamon and Pascal are less white saviour figures than they are an entry point for western audiences, presumably cast in an attempt to maximise the crossover between Hollywood and Chinese blockbuster markets. With a budget of £120m, the English-language debut from Chinese director Zhang Yimou ( House of Flying Daggers , Hero ) is the most expensive China-US co-production to date. From its swooping, acrobatic camerawork, to the fight scenes unfolding in eye-popping 3D, it’s easy to see where the money has been spent. It works well enough as an action-adventure romp, too, despite its simplistic plotting.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Watch a trailer for The Great Wall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T10:49:52.653+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
