Gen. P.M. Bali, Director General, Perspective Planning, Indian Army, said the launch of GSAT-7, India's first dedicated military satellite, is a testimony to the country's outlook towards using the outer space for national security. \n\nHe noted that India possesses one of the largest constellations of communication and remote sensing satellites covering Asia Pacific. \n\nLt. Gen. Bali said although India continues with a civilian orientation to its space programme, the changing regional and global realities require it to also develop military assets in space and on ground as an emerging regional and global power. \n\nHe said there is a need for a dedicated military space programme with adequate resources at its disposal because of \"the changing realities in our neighbourhood\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T16:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T06:02:17.203+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
