His order also blocks citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States for the next 90 days. The countries are Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Syria, Sudan, Libya and Somalia. \nAny request by federal immigration officials for students' information or access to a school site will be \"immediately forwarded to the superintendent for review,\" according to Hill's email, which ensures that Burbank Unified will comply with the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Plyler v. Doe, which ruled in 1982 that states can't deny enrolling children in a public school based on their immigration status. \n\"The Burbank Unified School District will continue to cultivate an environment of acceptance, support and kindness for all,\" Hill added. \nIn Glendale, state Assemblywoman Laura Friedman (D-Glendale) sent a letter to Glendale Unified Supt. Winfred Roberson Jr. on Jan. 24, a few days before Trump issued the order. In the letter, Friedman expressed her appreciation for Roberson considering to introduce a resolution declaring Glendale schools as safe zones. \n\"Passing this resolution will send a clear message to our community that all families are valued and will be supported, that all of our schools have a role to play in fostering the dreams, the imagination and the success of every student, and that regardless of the changes in Washington, D.C., our steadfast commitment to our students and families will remain the same,\" Friedman wrote in the letter, which was posted online. \nIn a statement that California State Supt. Tom Torlakson issued Monday afternoon, he encouraged school districts across the state \"to continue safe-haven efforts.\" \n\"As a teacher, coach, father, citizen and leader of California's public school system, I strongly disagree with President Trump's recent immigration order and want to make sure that our students and families who are refugees and Muslims feel safe and protected in our schools,\" he said. \"Diversity is California's strength. We do not just welcome diversity. We celebrate it. An ill-conceived presidential executive order is not going to change that.\" \n--", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:41:29.117+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
