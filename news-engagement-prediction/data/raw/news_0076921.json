Close Trump escalates war on media UP NEXT VIDEO Trump escalates war on media \nMuhammad Ali Jr, 44, who was born in Philadelphia and has a US passport, was travelling with his mother Khalilah Camacho-Ali, the late sports icon's second wife, friend and lawyer Chris Mancini told the Louisville Courier-Journal. \nMancini told the newspaper that both were held for questioning on the Fort Lauderdale International Airport on February 7 because of their Arabic-sounding names. \nCamacho-Ali, however, was released after she showed US Customs agents a photo of herself with her ex-husband. \nAli Jr had no such photo and according to Mancini was held for nearly two hours and repeatedly asked: \"Where did you get your name from?\" and \"Are you Muslim?\".

He was 74. \nAli was celebrated as much for his three world heavyweight titles as for his civil rights battles outside the ring. \nIn 1964 Ali dropped his birth name of Cassius Clay when he converted to Islam. \nThe Louisville, Kentucky native was married four times he was survived by seven daughters and two sons.
