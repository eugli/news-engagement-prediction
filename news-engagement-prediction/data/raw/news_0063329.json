(The ranking originated in January 2013.) \nThe DJ duo breaks out of the tie with Avicii's \"Wake Me Up!,\" which spent 26 weeks atop the chart in 2013-14. \"Closer\" first led the list dated Sept. 3, 2016. \n\"Closer\" earns top Digital Gainer honors on the latest tally, having sold 34,000 downloads in the tracking week (up 35 percent), according to Nielsen Music. It also culled 22.4 million U.S. streams and drew 79 million airplay audience impressions. \n\"Closer\" previously made dance chart history by leading Billboard 's Dance/Mix Show Airplay survey for 20 weeks . The song has received remixes for dance/mix show radio from Shaun Frank, R3hab and Dave Aude, among others. (The Dance/Mix Show Airplay chart measures radio airplay on a select group of full-time dance stations, along with plays during mix shows on more than 80 pop-formatted reporters.) \nPlus, \"Closer\" has now spent the most weeks on any title all-time in the top five of the Billboard Hot 100's top five (26 weeks). It led Billboard 's all-genre flagship songs chart for 12 weeks in 2016. \nJB McDaniel, program director of Seattle's full-time dance-formatted KNHC (C89.5), tells Billboard , \"The Chainsmokers captured the imagination of the C89.5 audience immediately after stepping out early on [earlier 2016 hit] 'Roses,' and the mania for their music continued right through [follow-ups] 'Don't Let Me Down' and 'Closer.' They were our most-played artist of 2016.\" \nSays Mike Popadines, associate manager/programming for Music Choice's Dance/EDM channel, \"'Closer' is a major smash across multiple Music Choice channels. With this single, these two guys established themselves as heavyweight champs in the pop and dance worlds.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:07:24.832+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
