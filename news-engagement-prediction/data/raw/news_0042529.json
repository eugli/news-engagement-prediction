But why?\nIs it deliberate, or do politicians just have bad taste? With their sartorial advisors and ample funds, surely they could make the effort to see a tailor?\nRead more Trump experiencing ‘cabin fever’ after month in White House Well the reason is actually three-fold:\nFirstly, politicians all want to appear relatable - they avoid looking too slick or flashy so as not to alienate working class voters who can’t afford a £5,000 suit.\nDuring last year’s election campaign, Hillary Clinton was blasted for wearing a $12,000 (£9,600) Armani jacket and Theresa May sparked outrage for wearing a pair of £995 leather trousers.\nBarry Brummett, a professor of communication at the University of Texas, told Mel Magazine that you \"have to show that people from all classes ... can identify with you\".\n\"You can’t go on wearing overalls, but you also can’t be too flashy.”\nSecondly, the demands of holding office mean politicians’ weights often fluctuate - it’s a stressful job, and just like the rest of us, stress can result in periods of binge eating followed by not eating.\nIf your weight’s changing all the time, there’s no way you could be constantly in a perfectly-fitting suit, according to Washington DC-based political consultant Josh Nanberg.\nThe controversial orders Donald Trump has already issued 10 show all The controversial orders Donald Trump has already issued 1/10 Trump and abortion Protesters flood Independence Avenue during the Women's March\nGetty\n2/10 Trump and abortion US President Donald Trump signs an executive order as Chief of Staff Reince Priebus looks on in the Oval Office of the White House\nGetty Images\n3/10 Trump and 'Obamacare' Nancy Pelosi who is the minority leader of the House of Representatives speaks beside House Democrats at an event to protect the Affordable Care Act in Los Angeles, California.

And of course, their outfits are scrutinised wherever they go (particularly if they happen to be female).\nSo it’s probably only partially deliberate that Trump’s suits are horrendous - he could undoubtedly get himself some better clothes without spending the average citizen’s annual income.\nBarack Obama, for example, always wore suits that fit him well, despite his admission that he didn’t want to make decisions about what he wore “because I have too many other decisions to make.”\nOf course, whilst appearing relatable, a head of state also needs to seem professional, so it’s a tricky balance to strike.\n“You want the voter to be concentrated not on what you’re wearing, but what you’re trying to communicate,” Jason Levin from LA-based communications company Cerrell Associates told Mel Magazine .\nTrump may be unlikely to change his policies any time soon, but he could at least upgrade his wardrobe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T17:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T12:32:29.168+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
