PHOTO: MID-DAY \nLatest victim of baseless gossip, veteran Bollywood actor, Farida Jalal was rumoured to have passed away last night. \nWhile many were shocked over her sudden ‘demise’, the news could not be confirmed. However, turns out it was all a faux! Fortunately, the Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayengay actor is hale and hearty, and she said so herself! \nUnexpected: Alive and kicking \nAccording to a report in DNA , Farida slammed the rumours about her death and said, “I am hale and hearty.” \nShe further added, “I don’t know from where these baseless rumours are coming from. Initially I laughed, but from last 30 minutes my phone have been constantly ringing and everybody is asking the same question. It’s a bit irritating, I wonder why people spread such rumours.” \nPreviously Amitabh Bachchan, Yo Yo Honey Sing, Dilip Kumar were also victims of death hoax. \nObviously, once Farida’s statement was released, Twitter exploded. \nI'm really glad my Favourite Actress is within us. #FaridaJalal Don't believe in Fake News and stop spreading it across. \n— Duheeta Joshi (@Duheeta2) February 20, 2017 Even the breathing person can be made dead with millions following it.That's social media for you #FaridaJalal \n— Ishan Bajpai (@isbajpai) February 20, 2017 Actress @FaridaJalal__ dead?
