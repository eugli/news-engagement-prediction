It's not Alia Bhatt Sidharth Malhotra recently clicked a selfie with the best kisser in town and no, it was not his rumoured girlfriend Alia Bhatt. IndiaToday.in | Written by Samrudhi Ghosh A + A - \nSidharth Malhotra and Alia Bhatt may be painting the town red, but Sid's selfie with the 'best kisser' did not feature his rumoured girlfriend Alia Bhatt. \nThe Baar Baar Dekho actor was the guest of honour at a dog show last evening in Mumbai, and the special 'best kisser' was a dog who won the award! Photo: Samrudhi Ghosh Photo: Samrudhi Ghosh \nSidharth, who is a self-confessed dog lover, also recalled a funny incident about his first dog. \n\" Mere parents ne mujhe ek pet gift kiya, ek male dog. I think main dus saal ka tha. Woh do-teen hafte ka puppy tha. Jab usko vet ke paas leke jaate hai, toh aapko ek form bharna padta hai. Mujhe bola gaya tha ki with male dog hai, kutta. Maine wahi bhara. Wahaan pe jaake mujhe vet ne bataya ki yeh female hai. (My parents gifted me a two or three-week-old puppy when I was about ten years old, and I was told it was a male dog. When I took the puppy to the vet, I filled its sex as male in the form. But I was told by the vet that it was actually a female),\" Sidharth said. \nAt the same event, Sidharth was also asked about how his Valentine's Day went. When he said it was good, he was asked whether he was at the residence of Alia Bhatt, because he was indeed clicked there.
