If during the first month of the administration Pence was on the outside looking in – he only learned that Flynn had misled him once the Washington Post was about to break the story, two weeks after Trump had found out – it now seems like he's gaining a say in staffing while developing his own voice on the world stage. \nPutting Pence in the driver's seat makes sense on a lot of levels, especially given that Trump is more interested in campaigning than governing. There's just one hitch, and it's a huge one: Trump's ego. Trump doesn't like the perception that someone else is in charge (\"No puppet!\") and will undercut Pence if he's getting too much credit. And all the talk of the 25th Amendment and impeachment, Pence's most direct paths to the Oval Office, won't endear him to Trump. \nBut with Trump in Florida two to three days a week, and showing vanishingly little interest in policy details, someone has to run the country. While advisers like Steve Bannon will try to keep that power in the Oval Office, Pence is gaining ground. And Trump? While his campaign rallies energize him, they also diminish him. He's the guy who got the job but can't stop interviewing, while Pence does the work, and prepares for the possibility of a sudden promotion.
