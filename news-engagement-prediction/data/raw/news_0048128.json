Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nSutton manager Paul Doswell concedes he does not know whether his players had a bet on reserve goalkeeper Wayne Shaw eating a pie vs Arsenal in the FA Cup. \nThe roly poly goalie has since resigned after a betting investigation was sparked due to a betting sponsor offering odds of 8-1 for him to scoff live on air. \nDoswell spoke of his disappointment that his side's fairy tale run had been marred and that he hoped his players and staff were not involved. \n\"None of the players were aware of this scenario. If any of players or staff have had a bet, they'll suffer the same consequences. I cannot say hand on heart that I know, but I can just say I hope I know,\" Doswell told Sky Sports News HQ. \n“It’s been very disappointing. I woke up this morning to this storm and criticism. It’s something we’ve dealt with quickly as a club.

It’s a very sad end to what was a very, very good story.” \nRichard Watson, Gambling Commission enforcement and intelligence director, said: “Integrity in sport is not a joke and we have opened an investigation to establish exactly what happened. \n“As part of that we’ll be looking into any irregularity in the betting market and establishing whether the operator has met its licence requirement to conduct its business with integrity.” \nFA rules say players should not “instruct, permit, cause or enable” any person to bet the “result, progress, conduct or any other aspect of, or occurrence in, a football match or competition.” \nPlayers are also not allowed to give others insider details “any information relating to football” which has been “obtained by virtue of his or her position within the game”. \nAn FA spokesperson said: “We are investigating to establish whether there has been any breach of The FA rules relating to betting.” \nBut 23-stone Shaw insists he did no wrong and did not influence the bet by telling his teammates his intentions.

I think a few of the mates and a few of the fans. \n“It was just a bit of banter for them.

I thought I would give them a bit of banter and let's do it.

He said: “I think Wayne has become this global superstar on the back of being 23 stone. He’s made that a chance to make some more media coverage off the back of it. \n“The reality is I don’t know [if Shaw did it for a bet] but it wouldn’t surprise me. I don’t think it shows us in the best light.” \nThe FA refused to comment on a potential investigation. \nLucas Perez and Theo Walcott netted for the Gunners to set up a quarter-final match-up with National League side Lincoln.
