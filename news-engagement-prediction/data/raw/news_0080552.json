The van’s 53-year-old male driver sustained a neck injury while the front-seat passenger fractured their ribs and both were taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. \nPolice confirmed the van was “loaded” with a dead body and another van had to be brought in to carry it from the scene. \nNewtown police are still searching for the 21-year-old and are understood to know who he is. \nThe pedestrian was taken to hospital with an injured wrist but cleared of fractures. \nThe 25-year-old man in a Toyota and 20-year-old female driver of a Nissan Qashqai were both involved in the accident but uninjured.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:17:27.879+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
