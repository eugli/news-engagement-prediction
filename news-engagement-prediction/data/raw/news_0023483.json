Trust me, I get it. Once upon a time, my friends went through the trouble of editing the Wikipedia page for “friend zone” to add my photo and some personal info about the history of the term. True story. So, I can totally relate to this guy who is so deep in the friend zone no one can hear him scream. Daniel and a female companion spent the day together, and I have no idea what the history is between them, but the date was romantic AF. He took her to dinner, got her flowers and went horseback riding — horseback riding, for God’s sake. Instagram And she had the audacity to describe it as a “friend date.” A FRIEND DATE. The girl posted a picture of the two sharing a lovely embrace and wrote, From Top Golf to dinner, flowers, ice cream and horseback riding, you out-did yourself on this friend date Daniel! You wanted to set a standard for how I should be treated and you sure set a high one. I thank God so much that He put an amazing friend like you in my life. Thank you for making me feel like a true princess! #stillsingletho Girl, you can take out the word “friend” because this was a straight-up date, and apparently an amazing one, too. She was treated like a “true princess,” but brutally signed off the post with #stillsingletho. And people on Twitter are putting a comforting virtual arm around Daniel’s shoulder. Why would she put #stillsingletho if he knew it was a friend date?
