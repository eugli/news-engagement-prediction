Mr Alegounarias said this was not only to help NSW teachers access the material but also made it possible for the HSC courses to be sold. \nThe HSC is already offered in several international schools in Asia, including Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore, but there is also interest from Asian schools to teach the syllabuses. Advertisement \nStudents in Asian education systems, especially those in Hong Kong, Singapore and parts of mainland China, regularly outperform their Australian peers in the OECD's global Program for International Student Assessment (PISA). \nAustralian students were the equivalent of 1Â½ years behind top-performer Singapore's students in science in the most recent PISA results released late last year. Australian students were a year behind in reading and more than two years behind in maths. \nMr Alegounarias said the new syllabuses would be \"unashamedly focused on mastery\" and there would \"less breadth and more depth\" to better meet what students will need to learn for the future. \n\"Curriculum is our community's expression of what we want for the future,\" Mr Alegounarias said. \nIn English, all students will have to hone their writing skills and improve their grammar, spelling and punctuation while in the advanced courses, a Shakespeare text will remain compulsory. \nThere will be more statistical analysis in the standard maths course, and students will study the algorithms behind Google searches as well as focusing on key financial concepts such as compounding interest. \nThe advanced maths syllabuses are still being reviewed after criticism from leading mathematicians . \nThe new science syllabus will see a stronger focus on maths in Physics and Chemistry and, in History, students will look at how the modern world was shaped, with topics including the Enlightenment, the French Revolution and capitalism. \nStudents starting year 11 next year will be the first to study the new syllabuses.
