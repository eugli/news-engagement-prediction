(AFP Photo) \nThe dam itself was not in danger of collapse, the California department of water resources said, but there were major fears over the emergency spillway due to erosion damage on its concrete top after water began pouring over it on Saturday. \nAuthorities were releasing 100,000 cubic feet (2,830 cubic meters) of water per second from the main spillway, bringing down the level of reservoir Sunday so that there was no more flow into the emergency channel.

It’s clear the circumstances are complex and rapidly changing,” he said in a statement. The area of erosion on the lower half of the Oroville Dam spillway.

The structure is expected to face further strain in the coming months as northern California faces its wettest ever winter. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T01:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:35:17.854+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
