Curtains raise officially in April this year, at the Apple Park, and it isn’t without a fitting homage to Steve Jobs. \nOverlooking green meadows and the main Apple building within the park, Steve Jobs Theater will sport a 1,000 seat auditorium Apple Park was first envisioned by Steve Jobs as a centre for creativity and collaboration, and it’s seemingly transforming the heart of Santa Clara Valley from a concrete jungle into a luscious green cover. And in the middle of it all sits Apple’s new global headquarters, the campus’ ring-shaped, 2.8 million-square-foot main building which is clad entirely in the world’s largest panels of curved glass, according to Apple. To honour Steve Jobs memory and his enduring influence on Apple, the theatre at Apple Park will be aptly named as the Steve Jobs Theater. Overlooking green meadows and the main Apple building within the park, Steve Jobs Theater will sport a 1,000 seat auditorium with a 20-feet glass cylinder (165 feet in diameter), supporting a metallic carbon-fibre roof. Undoubtedly, it will turn into a major pilgrimage spot for not only Apple aficionados but for everyone who’s looking forward to visiting the brand new Apple campus from all over the world. Apple Park, which is the iPhone maker’s new 175-acre campus, will be ready for employees to start moving in from April 2017 onwards, the company said in a release. Apple doesn’t expect all the employees and business processes to become operational out of the new Apple Park campus from the get-go in April, and that the process of moving more than 12,000 people is expected to take over six months, the Cupertino-based company estimates. \nApple main building which is clad entirely in the world’s largest panels of curved glass inside Apple Park What’s more, the Apple Park isn’t fully finished as per Steve Jobs vision, either, and construction of several ancillary buildings and parklands is scheduled to continue throughout the rest of this year. Apple Park will include a visitors centre with an Apple Store and cafe open to the public, and a 100,000-square-foot fitness centre for Apple employees. \nAre you excited to check out the Apple Park later this year?
