Article continues below \nThe German Football Association warned that the club would be punished severely for the crowd trouble that broke out during their recent game against RB Leipzig. \nInitial reports suggest that the south stand which boasts the Yellow Wall will be closed for their next home game, while Dortmund also face a fine of around â‚¬100,000, per the Mirror. Article continues below Video: Twitter absolutely loves what Pep Guardiola said to Arter at full-time \nAgainst Leipzig, supporters threw objects and beer cups and waved banners reading 'Slaughter the Bulls' - a reference to their opponents' financial backers Red Bull. \nSadly, this doesn't seem to be a one off. That wasn't the first time there's been trouble at one of their games this season, and it might well not be the last either. Terrifying arsenal \nGoal report that prior to Dortmund's game away to Darmstadt, police had to prevent 90 of their fans from attending after they were found in possession of a number of alarming items. \nTwo coaches carrying the supporters were stopped en route, at which point weapons, balaclavas, drugs were confiscated. \nCombat gear, flares, and smoke bombs were also found. Dortmund speak out \nAs you'd expect, Dortmund have moved to condemn the fans in question, issuing the following statement: \n\"Anyone who travels with balaclavas, smoke bombs and combat gear in the name of Borussia Dortmund abuses the colours and values of our club and its 10 million friends and fans in Germany. \n\"Together with them, we stand up for the open and peaceful fan culture that we want to see in and around the stadiums week after week. \n\"Anyone who fully shares these values is still warmly welcomed.\" \nWhile it's clearly a minority who were involved, it's a worrying hark back to the kind of hooliganism nobody wants to see on the terraces in the modern game. \nShould Dortmund be punished again for their fans' behaviour?
