With the release of HNDRXX , Future's second album in as many weeks, the two have joined forces once again for the hypnotic R&B record \"Comin Out Strong.\" Abel performs the delicate hook and the rap-influenced opening verse, while Future confronts the media concerning the rumors and fake stories that have been spread about him over the last year.Production comes from Detail, who worked with Future on Honest's crowning moment \"I Be U,\" as well as \"Good Morning,\" a close relative to \"Drunk In Love,\" as well as Laval, Quebec producer High Klassified, who has not previously collaborated with Future or The Weeknd.
