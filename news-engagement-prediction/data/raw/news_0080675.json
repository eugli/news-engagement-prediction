The bullet pierced the marquee roof, hitting a waiter in the leg and a railway employee in the foot. \nHollande, who is not standing for a second term in the presidential elections next month, had just started speaking to the guests at a cocktail party to celebrate the opening of the line when the shot went off, the paper reported. \nAn inquiry had been opened into the incident, the officials said. \nThe injuries were not said to be serious and Hollande was among the guests who rushed to their aid, according to Le Parisien .
