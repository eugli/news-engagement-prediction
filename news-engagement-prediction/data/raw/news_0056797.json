By Peggy Truong Netflix | Cara Howe Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Comedian and The Daily Show host bae Trevor Noah’s new comedy special officially dropped on Netflix on Tuesday. Please reserve an hour of your time to watch Afraid of the Dark soon because (1) it's excellent and (2) it's only an hour, so you can literally finish folding laundry while crying laughing. If you have to wait until the weekend, know that the special contains many wonderful moments, including Nelson Mandela and Barack Obama impersonations, a bit on the power of Russian accents, and this — the problem with saying “don’t be a pussy,” a phrase common among dudes and bros you may or may not know. As Trevor recalls in the special, which was taped at New York City’s Beacon Theater one week before the presidential election (so not enough Trump jokes), a friend in Scotland hit him with “don’t be a pussy” after the comedian refused to go out for a second consecutive night of drinking. “Don’t be a pussy.” Yes. Because it implies weakness. Do not be like the vagina. The vagina that is weak. Don’t be a pussy … and yet, in my personal experience, I have found the pussy to be one of the strongest things I have ever come across in my life. \"Don’t be a pussy?\" Have you ever come across a pussy? You realize vaginas can start revolutions and end wars. You realize, even on a physical level, the vagina is one of the strongest things that have ever existed. Virtually indestructible. Many men in this room have tales of how they once defeated the pussy. Let me tell you now, they have not. The owner of the pussy may have given you the impression that you defeated the pussy, but it is alive and well, my friends. Whenever people say that, I go, “Do you understand how impressive the vagina is? Do you understand how strong it is?” There’s a reason men have sought to oppress it for so long. The vagina is frighteningly powerful. You realize that human beings come out of a vagina. Human beings come out and still it continues to work as intended. Do you understand how impressive that is? A human being comes out of the vagina. And still, it continues to operate, it continues to work, after a human has just come out. You’re saying it’s weak? You just sit on a penis wrong and it breaks.“Don’t be a penis,” that should be the phrase. I wish I was a pussy. Are you serious right now? The consensus on Twitter so far: five out of five Netflix stars. trevor noah's ode to pussy is mcmurdering me pic.twitter.com/iW01h1fQaZ — notorious klance @ 4 (@kiseing) February 22, 2017 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below — Amanda Marie (@justamanda421) February 22, 2017 @Trevornoah \"Afraid of the Dark\" LOVE HIM EVEN MORE.

They're the best!! #AfraidOfTheDark — Abigail Arunga (@AbigailArunga) February 21, 2017 As Bustle points out, Trevor is likely not the first to point out the problem with “don’t be a pussy,” but he deserves all the praise for tearing it apart so eloquently before impersonating a weak and shriveled penis on stage without cracking. Plus he does a mean Scottish accent (among a handful of others). Bravo. Follow Peggy on Twitter .
