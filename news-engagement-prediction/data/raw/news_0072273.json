She arrived in a glittery pleated dress by Suno with just a hint of animal print. Actress Ruth Negga attends the 'Loving' photocall during the 69th annual Cannes Film Festival in May 2016.

It's something no other actress right now is really capable of. \nMaybe it stems from Negga always looking like she's having a blast — like in July, when she wore pants covered in cat faces. Actors Graham McTavish, Ruth Negga and Joseph Gilgun attend San Diego Comic-Con 2016. \nOr in October, when she wore a Dolce & Gabbana cat dress to a press conference for Loving .

Actress Ruth Negga attends the Cartier Fifth Avenue Grand Reopening Event at the Cartier Mansion in September 2016. \nAnd this bright-green Prada dress with sparkles she wore to People 's \"Ones to Watch\" event in October.

Actress Ruth Negga attends the Creative Impact Awards and 10 Directors to Watch Brunch at the 28th Annual Palm Springs International Film Festival. \nTo the Palm Springs International Film Festival, Negga wore a barely there and beautifully embroidered Valentino dress that could have looked like a negligee on anyone else.

Source: Jordan Strauss/AP \nIt was an unexpected mixture of hard and soft, a typical Negga move. \nSo no, maybe someone like Stone or Kidman shouldn't be the one you keep an eye on. Maybe it's not only time to give Negga a chance, but to look forward to her Oscars red-carpet debut. \nA woman who can pull off a cat dress, after all, should never be underestimated.
