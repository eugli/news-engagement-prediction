We must protect our houses of worship & religious centers. #JCC,\" she wrote on Twitter. \nThe JCC Association of North America, vowed that it \"will not be cowed by threats intended to disrupt people's lives or the vital role Jewish community centres play as gathering places, schools, camps and fitness and recreation centres.\" \n\"While we are relieved that all such threats have proven to be hoaxes and that not a single person was harmed, we are concerned about the anti-Semitism behind these threats, and the repetition of threats intended to interfere with day-to-day life,\" said the group's director of strategic performance David Posner.
