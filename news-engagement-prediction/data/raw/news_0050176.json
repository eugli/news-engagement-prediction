Tonight it’s the Writers Guild Association Awards, which highlights the best writing in TV, movies, and video games, and though the big winners in the movie-related categories don’t necessarily foreshadow what will happen next Sunday, at least La La Land was only eligible for the one prize—a prize that it did not end up winning, with Best Original Screenplay going to Moonlight instead. \nFor the other movie awards, Arrival won Best Adapted Screenplay and Command And Control won Best Documentary screenplay. It was a good night for Atlanta on the TV side of things, with Donald Glover’s baby picking up Best Comedy Series and Best New Series. Elsewhere, The Americans won Best Drama Series and Saturday Night Live won for Best Comedy/Variety Sketch Series. \nThe full list of winners is below. \nBest Episodic Drama \n“The Trip,” This Is Us , written by Vera Herbert \nBest Children’s Script—Episodic And Specials \n“Mel Vs. The Night Mare Of Normal Street,” Gortimer Gibbon’s Life On Normal Street \nBest Children’s Script—Long Form Or Special \nOnce Upon A Sesame Street Christmas \nBest Daytime Drama", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T11:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T06:27:19.545+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
