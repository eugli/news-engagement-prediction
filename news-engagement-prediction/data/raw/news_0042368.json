Join the movement at ninjasforhealth.com Feb 20 Coke is Running for President of the National Academy of Nutrition & Dietetics Soda-Funded Candidate Poised to Poison Presidency The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics , the world’s largest organization of 100,000 nutrition professionals, is electing its next President. Should candidates be required to disclose their corporate funding? The Academy has long been criticized for acting as a front-group for corporate food companies, especially the soda industry. Coca-Cola donated millions to the academy to successfully build partnerships with trusted dietitians to promote their unhealthy product. Member dietitians have been used by Coke to promote soda as a healthy snack , celebrate Coke’s role in raising healthy children , and vehemently oppose soda taxes . When the American Academy of Pediatrics needed support for a website it created to promote children's health, it turned… well.blogs.nytimes.com In 2015, the Academy ended its official Coca-Cola sponsorship with Coca-Cola after pressure from ethical dietitians, even receiving praise for taking a stand . The organization called “ Dietitians for Professional Integrity ” played a critical role organizing colleagues to hold their profession accountable. But, of course, the soda industry infiltration of the Academy and its dietitians did not end — it only evolved. The soda industry is helping fund a trojan horse of corporate sponsorship to infiltrate Academy leadership: Neva Cochran . Neva Cochran, one of only two candidates running for President of the Academy of Nutrition & Dietetics, is funded by the American Beverage Association and the Calorie Control Council , a coalition of food and beverage companies including Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Dr. Pepper. She was recently one of the dietitians caught being paid by ABA to oppose soda taxes on Twitter . Cochran’s primary experience relevant to the position is 27 years of food industry “consulting” with an extensive client list including food giants like Monsanto, McDonalds, and Coca-Cola. Never before has an Academy’s Presidential candidate been so compromised by corporate conflicts of interest. Yet Cochran’s candidate biography does not disclose these industry affiliations. Dietitians for Professional Integrity asked this year’s candidates about their stance on corporate sponsorship , but neither Cochran nor her competitor Mary Russell have responded to their candidate survey. Infographic dated 1/26/17 Selling Soda to Kids As part of Cochran’s role with the American Beverage Association and Calorie Control Council, she has specifically recommended soda to kids, teens, construction workers, and sedentary office workers. What a market! “If a job that requires a lot of physical exertion like a postman delivering mail by foot, a construction worker, a landscaper or a server in a busy restaurant, a regular soft drink can replace calories burned along with refreshment. On the other hand, someone working in a sedentary office position and also trying to lose weight could opt for a calorie-free soda.” — Neva Cochran ( 11/2/15 ) She often positions soda as a “favorite” and mentions how even she drinks diet soda as a part of her balanced diet. “You’ll also meet the recommended levels for fiber and 18 vitamins and minerals, with some calories left over for favorites like a soda or cookie.” — Neva Cochran ( 8/17/15 ) Cochran’s promotion of soda to kids and teens is particularly egregious. She repeats the soda industry’s talking point that soda does not contribute to childhood obesity and is even necessary for kids to fight fatigue. “Active teens: soda , lemonade, sweet tea & choc milk can replace calories & fluid.” — Neva Cochran ( 7/8/16 ) The medical and nutrition fields have reached consensus that soda is not healthy, especially for kids. This is the clearest way you can differentiate a soda salesperson from a nutrition advocate. Selling Soda as Better Than Water Neva Cochran doesn’t just love soda, she smears water too. She prefers sugar because “plain water isn’t that appealing”. Soda is hydrating for hot summer days… “Diet soda is a great choice for hydration, to satisfy your sweet tooth, and cool you off on hot summer days” — Neva Cochran ( 5/16/16 ) And her “nutrition education” articles always end with a glowing review of the sugary product she’s paid to promote. Fighting Soda Taxes As we recently uncovered , Cochran’s affiliation with soda companies includes participating in coordinated corporate campaigns to spread misinformation and smear community-level soda taxes. “While politicians try to legislate people’s eating habits by requiring warning labels or taxes on sugar and soda, these initiatives are usually doomed to fail.” — Neva Cochran ( 2/8/16 ) “As a registered dietitian nutritionist whose goal is to help people enjoy eating a variety of flavorful foods and beverages for health and wellness, I much prefer a positive approach of education to a negative one of regulation.” — Neva Cochran ( 2/8/16 ) Take Action This Academy of Nutrition & Dietetics election is happening now and dietitians CAN and MUST vote against a President more aligned with Coca-Cola that kids’ nutrition. Please tell all your dietitian friends to vote against Neva Cochran, and if elected, to hold her accountable.
