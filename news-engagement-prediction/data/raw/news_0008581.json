With free lift tickets, you can’t afford not to ski Japan.

The mountains are less than two hours away from Tokyo, perfect for anyone who wants to experience Japanese powder and city culture.

Simply show your passport at the ticket window, and get a free day of skiing. \nAnd, if you happen to be outside of that age range don’t worry — the promotion is also offering discounted lift tickets for roughly $17 USD for anyone that doesn’t fall within the 19-24 age range. \nWith the mountains of Fukushima only 80 minutes from the bustling streets of Tokyo by bullet train, the offer is a great opportunity for any travelers who want to get a couple turns in while still experiencing the big city culture.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T07:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T05:03:08.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
