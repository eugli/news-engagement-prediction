Yale University \nWhile we know what it looks like, and indeed where to find it, experts have been stumped by one single aspect of this bizarre creation of nature. No-one can actually agree on what it is. \nIt was initially decided last year by a team from Yale that Tully was in fact a vertebrate. However a team from the University of Pennsylvania have now claimed that actually this could all be wrong and that once again, Tully’s identity is a complete mystery. \nAbout a foot long with a rigid stalk of eyes on either side, the Tully has a long protruding beak with an oddly shaped claw face perched on the end. \nLast year researchers breathed a sigh of relief after a team from Yale University declared that definitively the Tully Monster was in fact a vertebrate. \nBy examining 1000s of fossils that had been collected around Mazon Creek in Illinois, the team concluded that they had found a common theme among many of them. \nA light line running down the middle was believed to be a ‘notochord’ - a flexible rod that formed the basis for an early backbone. \nAnother study from last year also argued that Tully was a vertebrate after an examination of the eyes suggested that it contained melanosomes - complex structures that meant Tully was in all probability a vertebrate. University of Pennsylvania \nNow though Penn State’s Lauren Sallan believes that these evaluations are far from perfect. \nFor starters Sallan and her colleagues noted that the conclusions made last year were based on a misunderstanding of how fossils are preserved in Mazon Creek. \n“In the marine rocks you just see soft tissues; you don’t see much internal structure preserved,” Sallan said. \nSallan and her team also have an argument for the development of the Tully’s eyes as well.
