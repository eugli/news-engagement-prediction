The teams agreed on the deal in the early evening and announced it hours later.\nThe Hawks will also send two 2017 second-round picks to the 76ers – their own and one they own from the Heat. The Hawks will get the 76ers 2017 second-round pick they hold from the Warriors.\nThe deal comes before the NBA trade deadline of Thursday at 3 p.m. The team will still be active in looking to make additions ahead of the deadline, according to a person familiar with the situation.\n“We are excited to welcome Ersan, and his family, to the Atlanta Hawks,” Hawks coach and president of basketball operations Mike Budenholzer said in a statement. “He’s a high-character, proven veteran who we’ve liked for many years and believe fits well within our system. We also want to thank Tiago for his contributions on and off the court. We wish him all the best in the future.”\nThe Hawks wanted to add to an offense that comes out of the All-Star break 26th in the league in efficiency. Ilyasova, a 6-foot-10 forward, is averaging 14.3 points, 4.6 rebounds and 1.7 assists in 26.9 minutes in 56 games with the 76ers and Thunder this season. In 53 games with the 76ers, including 40 starters, he shot .440 from the field and .359 from 3-point range.\nIlyasova has played nine NBA seasons, including stints with the Bucks, Pistons and Magic, with averages of 11.0 points and 6.0 rebounds. He was a second-round pick (No. 36 overall) by the Bucks in 2005 from Turkey. He also spent two years playing in Spain. Ilyasova, 29, will be an unrestricted free agent following the season.\nIlyasova shot about 40 percent after being acquired by the 76ers in November. His shooting has tailed off to 35.6 percent in February. His 3-point shooting dropped to 35.4 percent in January and 23.4 percent in February.\n“I am not going to say it’s just because of free agency,” Ilyasova told CSN Philadelphia before the All-Star break. “You have 82 games, you can’t play perfect. Sometimes you have good games and bad games. Last week I was kind of out of rhythm and missed a lot of shots.”\nIlyasova, who will wear No. 7, gives the Hawks some depth at the power forward position behind Paul Millsap and a player capable of spreading the court.\n“I want to thank Ersan Ilyasova for his positive contributions to this organization both on and off the basketball court,” 76ers president of basketball operations Bryan Colangelo said in a statement. “Ersan is a true professional whose daily examples of hard work, focus and consistency have helped facilitate the ongoing growth of our program and culture.”\nSplitter had an injury plagued two seasons with the Hawks after he was acquired in a trade with the Spurs. The center has not played a game this season due to hip and calf injuries. He played just 36 games last season before undergoing season-ending hip surgery. Splitter had an $8.5 million salary this season and will become an unrestricted free agent after the season.\nSplitter has been rehabbing all season from the hip surgery. He suffered a setback with the calf injury that has prevented him from playing. He has been progressing and getting closer to a return to the court.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T12:48:54.995+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
