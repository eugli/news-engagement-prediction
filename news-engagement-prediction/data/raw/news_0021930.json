Obama also oversaw the air campaign in Yemen against al Qaeda targets, and his first strike in 2009 was a disaster -- it mistakenly took a Bedouin village for a terrorist training camp, killing 41 civilians, according to Human Rights Watch, in addition to 14 suspected terrorists. And if the January raid killed Anwar al-Awlaki's daughter, a 2011 strike ordered by the Obama administration killed Awlaki's son. As the Obama administration tried to soften some of the hard-handed tactics inherited from the Bush administration in the country's war on terror, it ratcheted up the drone program , most notably in Pakistan, to target terrorist groups without putting US lives in danger. The Obama administration vastly accelerated the campaign in Yemen after the Arab Spring uprisings. WHAT NEXT? Yemenis search under the rubble of damaged houses following a reported Saudi-led coalition strike in Sanaa on February 1. The January raid is evidence of two things: AQAP remains a formidable, resilient enemy, and it is more deeply entrenched in Yemen's tribal society than ever, CNN's Tim Lister reports. A US official confirmed to CNN that the raid was aimed at better understanding connections between regional tribal fighters and al Qaeda operatives. AQAP has ably exploited Yemen's collapse as a state into a fractious and stunningly complex mosaic. It has gained from the Saudi military campaign of the past two years that has targeted the Houthi minority, one of AQAP's enemies in Yemen. The Houthis took control of the capital, Sanaa, and much of northern Yemen in the fall of 2014. Michael Horton, a senior analyst at the Jamestown Foundation and regular visitor to Yemen, told CNN of AQAP that \"the leadership recognizes it will be targeted and therefore actively trains replacements. It's also increasingly diffuse.\" Writing in the Combating Terrorism Center's Sentinel journal, Horton says AQAP is \"refining its capabilities in multiple areas, and in what is a dangerous parallel with Syria, is deepening its ties to local communities.\" Ground operations always carry with them substantial risk and uncertainty. Back in 2015, when he was director of the US National Counterterrorism Center, Nicholas Rasmussen said that \"the lack of robust US presence in the country significantly complicates our ability to carry out counter-terrorism operations inside Yemen.\" That presence remains weak today, and Yemen's chaos has grown even worse in the past two years. Combating AQAP remains a long-haul effort.
