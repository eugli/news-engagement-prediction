His next movie 'Thugs of Hindostan' is no different. The actor's look in the film has impressed one and all as he will be seen in a never-seen-before avatar. Reportedly, Shraddha Kapoor has also given a look test for the film. \n\nIn the film, Aamir will be seen sporting a full-grown beard and a handlebar moustache. 'Thugs of Hindostan' also brings together two power-packed actors like Aamir Khan and Amitabh Bachchan. \n\nThe film is based on the popular novel 'Confessions of a Thug' by Philip Meadows Taylor which tells the story of Imperial thugs who robbed the rich and elite travellers in India during the 1830s. \n\nIt will be interesting to see Shraddha share screen space with Mr. Perfectionist of Bollywood.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T18:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T11:44:20.275+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
