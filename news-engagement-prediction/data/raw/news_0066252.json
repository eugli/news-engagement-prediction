GMC All Mountain Sierra HD \nGMC Canada has partnered up with the Whistler-Blackcomb ski resort , from British Columbia, to engineer a vehicle that could climb the rocky mountains. The idea was to carry riders up Flute Bowl, where no ski-lift is available. Problem solved, I say. \nThe All Mountain is a bitchin’ contraption. It’s fitted with snow tracks, LED everything, a heavy-duty Allison rear-end, and a good old American V8 under its hood. I want one. 1867 Henry Seth Taylor Steam Buggy \nSo you thought Karl Benz was responsible for engineering the first automobile? You’d be wrong.

The Villeneuve F1 Cars \nIn 1997, Michael Schumacher tried to cut off a young , blond Québécois that was driving a blue and white Williams FW19. It was the biggest mistake of Schumacher’s career that year. That kid later went on to win the world championship. His name was Jacques Villeneuve. \nHe is also our country’s third most successful musician , behind Celine Dion and Nickelback. Canada, we need to have a talk. I love your Timbits with every strawberry-glazed fiber of my being. … Read more Read more Vintage Formula 1 Cars \nThis year’s CIAS underlines 50 years of Formula One in Canada by exposing some vintage F1 cars from milestone historical moments.

Well they also used to build cars! Introducing, the 1914 Russell. At the time, Russell automobiles aimed at building a truly Canadian luxury line of cars. This 14-28 model is a prime example. It features high-end luxury amenities such as “fine enamel” instead of brass, electric lights, and pebble-grain leather. Fancy.

Canada Post Vango Mailtruck \nWhere can I sign to have Canada Post get rid of its fleet of Ford Transit Connects and replace them with this: the Vango?

Isn’t it the cutest, coolest, most awesome-est, forbidden fruit, subcompact car you’ve ever seen? \nWe also have a Nissan Micra cup here in Canada , where a hole bunch of them Micras trade paint on the track. These things are particularly fun to watch during the Canadian Grand-Prix in Montréal. They also make more noise than the F1 cars. Ontario Provincial Police BRP Can-Am Commander \nWhile on my quest to find the uniquely Canadian stuff at CIAS, I couldn’t help but jot down this thing. No, but seriously, I think the only way this BRP Can-Am Commander police side-by-side could be more Canadian, is if it would be loaded with Timbits and dripping with maple syrup. Wait, I just had an idea. The CN Tower \nBefore the erection of Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, Canada held the record for having the tallest tower in the world for 34 years running. The CN tower stands at 1,815.3 ft tall.
