Sky Sports takes a look at Brady's previous triumphs. Brady (left) and head coach Bill Belichick celebrated after their first Super Bowl win against the Rams XXXVI, St Louis Rams 17-20 New England Patriots, 2002 \nIn the second game of the 2001 season, starting quarterback Drew Bledsoe suffered internal bleeding after a hit from New York Jets linebacker Mo Lewis, and had to be replaced by second-year QB Brady. \nAfter starting the year 0-2, Brady's Patriots won 11 of the next 14 and qualified for their first post-season under second-year head coach Bill Belichick. \nIn the Super Bowl, they met the Rams, who were heavy favourites. New England claimed a 17-3 lead, but it was Rams QB Kurt Warner, who led his offence back to 17-17, with just 1:30 on the clock. \nWithout a timeout, Brady marched his team downfield, setting up kicker Adam Vinatieri for the game-winning, 48-yard field goal. Brady was named Super Bowl MVP, delivering the organisation's first ever Championship. Brady was mobbed following his second MVP performance XXXVIII, Carolina Panthers 29-32 New England Patriots, 2004 \nConsidered one of the most entertaining Super Bowls of all time, the Patriots triumphed for a second time, overcoming the Panthers in Houston - the city selected for this year's Super Bowl LI. \nDespite being scoreless for a record time of 26:55, the teams managed 24 points in the final three minutes of the half, with New England leading 14-10. \nOnce again, the game came down to a field goal, with Vinatieri converting a 41-yard attempt. Brady secured his second MVP title, setting a Super Bowl record for most pass completions (32), while amassing 354 yards and three touchdowns. Running back Corey Dillon gave New England an unassailable lead against the Eagles XXXIX, New England Patriots 24-21 Philadelphia Eagles, 2005 \nOff the back of the previous year's success, the Patriots posted another 14-2 regular season record, bettered only by the Pittsburgh Steelers, who finished their campaign 15-1. \nDespite having established himself as one of the league's elite passers, New England were led by running back Corey Dillon, who racked up 1,635 yards in the regular season. \nIt was another close game, with the teams tied at 14-14 going into the final quarter. Dillon scored on a two-yard run, before Vinatieri scored a short field goal and, despite a touchdown from Greg Lewis, the Eagles couldn't overturn the deficit. The worst play call in Super Bowl history? Many Seahawks fans think so! XLIX, New England Patriots 28-24 Seattle Seahawks, 2015 \nBrady had to wait 10 years for his next ring, having lost twice to the New York Giants after the 2007 and 2011 seasons. Having won the year before, Seattle became the only team since the 2005 Patriots to make back-to-back Super Bowls. \nGoing into the fourth quarter, the Seahawks led 24-14, but Brady led the fightback, throwing touchdown passes to Danny Amendola and Julian Edelman. \nThe Seahawks had an opportunity to take the game with 26 seconds left. However, instead of running the ball with Marshawn Lynch, Russell Wilson's pass was picked off by undrafted rookie cornerback Malcolm Butler, and the Patriots won, in one of the most dramatic finales in Super Bowl History. In four meetings, Brady has never lost to the Falcons, while Matt Ryan's two games against New England have resulted in losses LI, New England Patriots 34-28 Atlanta Falcons, 2017 \nBrady threw for over 450 yards, leading his team back from 21 points down. Never before had a team come back from such a deficit, but the Patriots' unanswered 19 fourth quarter points sent the game into overtime. \nBrady then led his team 75 yards down the field, before handing off to James White for the winning score, and further cementing himself in NFL history.
