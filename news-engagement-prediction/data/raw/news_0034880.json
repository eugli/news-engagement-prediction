Not sure what the game's about? Click on that title for a rundown of all the details we've learned so far, but keep reading here to learn more about the beta. When is it? \nThe Ghost Recon: Wildlands open beta will run from February 23 at 6 am EST / 11 am GMT to February 27 at the same time. The full game will follow on March 7. How do I get in? \nIt's a free, open beta for PC, PS4, and Xbox One, so all you need to do is download the client from your online store of choice and play. You can also \"RSVP\" for the beta on Ubisoft's official site , which just means they'll send you a reminder when you can start downloading. Pre-loading will be available sometime February 20 in the UK and in the US on February 21 at 6 am EST. Can I play co-op? \nYep, you can play through everything in the beta (and the full game) with up to three other players. You'll need an Xbox Live Gold or PlayStation Plus subscription to participate in multiplayer. Ok, but do I HAVE to play in co-op? \nNope! You're also free to play the beta (and again, the whole game) in single-player if you prefer the company of AI squadmates. What's there to do? \nThis beta version will give players the run of two provinces: Itacua and Montuyoc. The full game will offer 21, so this is just an appetizer, but there should still be plenty of room to roam. You're free to take on missions against the drug cartels and their allies in either territory as you choose, though you'll have an easier time if you tackle Itacua first. Montuyoc will be significantly more challenging for new players. Wherever you go, you'll be able to use a selection of the full game's vehicles and weapons to carry out stealthy operations or explosive assaults. Are there any beta bonuses for the full game? \nThere is at least one reward, and it's not the usual crummy weapon skin business. Participate in the open beta and you'll get access to the exclusive \"Unidad Conspiracy\" mission if you play the full game before March 31 (it comes out March 7). Just make sure you use the same Ubisoft account for both. How many explosions will there be? \nAt least this many.
