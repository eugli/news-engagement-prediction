Photo courtesy of the artist \nChicago juke meets Berlin's shadowy dancefloors in the latest from Dirtybird. Today (February 3) the party-hearty crew release the debut EP from Windy City duo Fancy Fux, titled Stripper . Featuring local rapper and \"Queen of Drill\" Katie Got Bandz, it's a hyperactive addition to the label's booty-house sound. Even better, it's accompanied by two acid workouts from Dirtybird mainstay Kill Frenzy. \nAs a press release tells it, the track was sent as a demo submission to crew leader Claude VonStroke, who played it out at one of his gigs last summer as a road test. Upon hearing the audience's enthusiastic reaction, he knew he had to sign it. When it came time to commission remix duties, he looked within Dirtybird's ranks to Kill Frenzy, who is described as \"the most obsessed\" with juke. \n\"When they asked me to remix this one I didn't even have to think twice about it,\" Frenzy tells THUMP over email. \"This record is so groovy and fun; it put a smile on my face.\" Erasing nearly all the vocals from the original, the Berlin-based producer adds the dark grit of his current hometown to his Stripped mix, infusing it with another musical native to Chicago: acid. The result is a minimalistic workout that oozes sweat with each beat. Listen to it below and buy it here .
