Former alliance partners BJP and the Shiv Sena emerged as the top contenders after a bitterly fought campaign. While both parties seem confident of winning the majority, here's a look at how matters stand at the moment: \n\n1. Elections for the 227-member Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) took place on Tuesday and counting of votes began on Thursday. Voter turnout hit a record 55 per cent, the strongest response to a civic poll in the city in 25 years. \n\n2. The BJP and the Shiv Sena, which were allies in the BMC for over two decades, fought the February 21 polls separately. \n\n3. The Shiv Sena charged the BJP of rampant corruption in running the BMC. It's also speculated that the parties couldn't reach a consensus on seat-sharing. \n\n4. The Sena is a part of the Narendra Modi-led NDA government at the Centre as well the Devendra Fadnavis-led dispensation in Maharashtra. Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray had even threatened to withdraw support from the Fadnavis government. \n\n5. All eyes are on the Sena, which has controlled the cash-rich BMC since 1997, and this is the first time it has been challenged in several years. \n\n6. The polls are also a matter of honour for chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who reviled the alliance alleging corruption and financial irregularities against the Sena. \n\n7. In a no-holds barred parallel campaigns led by Fadnavis and Uddhav Thackeray, the Sena and the BJP laid charge and countercharge against each other to sway voters in their favour and gain control of the BMC, which is Asia's largest civic body. \n\n8. Sources in the Sena said the party's internal survey shows it will win 110 out of the 202 seats it contested. On the other hand, sources in the BJP said the party is confident of bagging 108 seats on its own. The half way mark to rule the civic body is 114 seats. \n\n9. Party sources also claimed that if Shiv Sena secures a majority in the election, it will withdraw its support to the state government. However, a hung corporation is also a very real possibility, which may force the BJP and Shiv Sena to call a truce to assume power. \n\n10. Besides Mumbai, elections were also held for nine other corporations. A total of 17,331 candidates are in the fray for 3,210 seats up for grabs in this second phase of civic/local body polls in Maharashtra, being seen as \"mini general election\".
