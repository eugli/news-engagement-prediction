Tucker Battles Student Over Whiteboard Ban \nNigel Farage, a member of the European Parliament from England and one of the key figures behind Brexit, spoke at CPAC today and called 2016 the beginning of a global political revolution. \nHe said that November 8th will be remembered in the U.S. as the historic day that President Trump was elected, just like June 23rd will be remembered in the U.K. as the day the British people voted to leave the European Union. \nHe joked that his \"favorite part\" of election night was watching the shocked reactions by the commentators on CNN. And he predicted that Trump, like Brexit in the United Kingdom, will become \"more popular by the day\" in the U.S. \nFarage said 68 percent of Britons now want Brexit to move forward, according to a recent poll. \nFarage, a Fox News contributor, said that in both the U.K. and the U.S., citizens have endured years of politicians making promises, getting elected and not even attempting to fulfill their campaign promises. \nHe said that in just 36 days, Trump has shown that will not be the case with his administration. \n\"I'm seeing an elected leader who is trying to put in place the platform on which he was elected. How about that!\" Farage said. \"What Trump is doing, by trying to put in place that ticket on which he was elected, he is restoring faith in the democratic process.\" \n\"2016 was the year that the nation-state democracy made a comeback against the globalists and those who would wish to destroy everything that we have ever been.\" \nWatch more above, and see President Trump's CPAC address . \nFarage also spoke to Neil Cavuto on Fox Business this afternoon, reacting to Trump's speech to CPAC in which the president made another lengthy denunciation of the \"fake news\" media. \nHe said mainstream American and European broadcasters are behaving in the same way and are in denial about the \"global political revolution.\" \n\"They're simply not prepared to accept that Brexit happened, that Trump happened. They kind of want to turn the clock back. What they don't realize is they're losing viewers, they're losing listeners and they are losing this battle big time,\" he said. \nWatch the interview below.
