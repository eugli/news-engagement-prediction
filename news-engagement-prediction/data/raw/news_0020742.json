However, more is expected north of the city, making the morning traffic rush into the city a tricky one.\nBy morning, temperatures are expected to rise from -12 to -2 as flurries taper off. But the snow is expected to return around 1 p.m. and will continue to fall until about 10 p.m., this time leaving about five centimetres of snow in its wake in the downtown core.\nThe forecast once again says heavier snow will fall north of Toronto, and some areas could see up to 10 centimetres of accumulation.\nHeaviest snow during evening rush \nThe heaviest snow should fall as people make their way home in the evening, between 4 p.m. and 8 p.m., according to the forecast. Gusty winds could result in blowing snow and low visibility on the roads for the evening commute.\nWarmer weather and dryer conditions are expected Saturday but active weather is expected to return by Sunday.\nSouthern Ontario could see wet snow in some parts leaving several centimetres of accumulation on the ground.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T04:53:50.167+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
