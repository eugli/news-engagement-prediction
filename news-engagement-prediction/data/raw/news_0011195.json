A Seattle federal judge on Friday blocked the ban , which the President has called “ridiculous”.\nThe New York Times reports that the day before the travel ban was blocked, curators at MoMA began replacing works by Picasso, Matisse and Picabia in the fifth-floor gallery with pieces by Iraqi-born British architect Zaha Hadid, Sudanese painter Ibrahim el-Salahi and Iranian video artist Tala Madani. \nRead more Donald Trump launches attack on judge who stopped 'Muslim travel ban' Each new piece has been taken from the museum’s permanent collection. Next to each work appears a piece of wall text, stating: “This work is by an artist from a nation whose citizens are being denied entry to the United States, according to a presidential executive order issued on Jan 27, 2017. This is one of several such artworks from the Museum’s collection installed throughout the fifth floor galleries to affirm the ideals of welcome and freedom as vital to this Museum as they are to the United States.”\nThe fifth floor galleries traditionally document Western modernism until the 1940s, but now they will include works by several Iranian artists alongside Hadid and el-Salahi, such as sculptor Parviz Tanavoli and photographer Shirana Shahbazi, the newspaper reports.\nSpeaking to Quartz , Christophe Cherix, the museum’s chief curator of drawings and prints, said there will be more works by artists from the seven countries displayed over the ensuing months. \nPresident Donald Trump lashes out at US judge on Twitter Read more Apple to Zynga file legal brief against Donald Trump immigration order Super Bowl advert referencing Trump's border wall 'censored' Trump condemned by Republicans over 'respect' for Vladimir Putin Lady Gaga sent a hidden message to Trump at her Super Bowl performance “A number of artists in our collection suddenly couldn’t travel the way they used to and share their work and ideas. We wanted to reaffirm that belief that art [museums] should be a place where people from all over the world can gather,” he said.\nOther major artists being reshuffled from the fifth floor galleries to make way for the works include Kokoschka, Ensor and Boccioni, while a large steel sculpture by Iranian artist Siah Armajani has been set in the lobby.\nMr Cherix assured people that paintings such as Van Gogh’s ‘Starry night’ and Matisse’s ‘Red Studio’, which are hugely popular, will remain on display. He said the idea behind the change in the permanent collection on display was to find an “inclusive gesture”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T11:04:30.334+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
