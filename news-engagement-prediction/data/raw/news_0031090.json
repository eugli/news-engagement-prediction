He said that Trump should work with the US’s European allies to exactly define penalties in responses that the group would impose on Iran both for small and grayish violations of the nuclear deal as well as for greater violations.He specifically noted European allies, stating that these new efforts should go forward even without Russian and Chinese help, since those countries were unlikely to assist with confronting Iran going forward.As part of these new efforts, Yadlin said it was critical that Iran receive the message that the US was ready to walk away from the deal if Iran abused it.Further, he said Iran must believe that the consequences of walking away from the deal could be either a return to wide international sanctions or even a military attack, if it came too close to crossing the nuclear threshold.
