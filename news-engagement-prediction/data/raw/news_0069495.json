NLC \nActing NUT state Chairman, Kemi Solaru who addressed newsmen yesterday at the Union’s secretariat in Kuto, Abeokuta, said the NUT did not believe in the action by the Nigeria Labour Congress to protest against the government. \nVanguard gathered that the NLC may protest following the refusal of the state government to recall the four leaders of NUT including its State Chairman, Dare Ilekoya, out of about 35 that were either sacked or suspended, but, were later recalled. \nIlekoya and others were yet to be pardoned by the state government for allegedly running foul of the civil service rules during the celebration of 2016 world teachers day. \nWhile speaking on the proposed protest by the NLC, Solaru said, the NUT believes in dialogue rather than the protest,saying the union had been able to get results from dialogue in the past.
