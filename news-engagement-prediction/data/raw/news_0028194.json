New sheriff in town — This week marked the release of the new Top247, which featured a new top prospect in state of Texas — Houston Lamar’s Anthony Cook . Now a five star recruit, Cook also shot up to the top ranked cornerback in the country. Cook has everything you want in a corner. He has excellent height, great technique and a physical swagger that frustrates opposing wide outs. Ohio State, LSU and Texas are some of his early standouts. \n2. Got Open — Three players from the state of Texas received invites to The Opening finals in Oregon this summer — Alief Taylor wide receiver Brennan Eagles , Houston Heights cornerback Jalen Green and the aforementioned Cook. Eagles was perhaps the biggest breakout star of the camp as he finished at the top of the ratings boards with freakish testing numbers and impressed in 1-on-1’s. \n3. Elite TE back on market — Spring Dekaney tight end Malcolm Epps decided to back out of his verbal commitment to Alabama just before taking part in The Opening Houston regional on Sunday. Epps simply said he wanted to explore other options. So who is the new favorite in the race for his services? Right now, that answers appears to be Texas A&M, but Epps added that he would also consider Texas and others. \nCommits \n*** It was a big week for UTSA as the Roadrunners added four commitments, including three from the state of Texas. The first was sleeper Sinton wide receiver Andrew McGowan . A two-star prospect, McGowan is raw but has high upside. UTSA then landed McAllen Memorial safety Kelechi Nwachuku and San Antonio Wagner offensive tackle Spencer Burford-Watts . \n*** It’s not a great year in the state of Texas for running backs, but Houston landed one of the highest ranked in three-star Desoto ball carrier Kelan Walker . He committed to Houston over offers from Colorado, Iowa State, SMU and others. \n*** Oklahoma State always seems to reach into the Lone Star State and come away with a sleeper or two. The Cowboys might have found that this cycle in Frisco Heritage tight end Nic McTear . He picked OSU over a handful of G5 offers. \nProspect of the week \nI’m not exactly sure what he plays at the next level (probably safety or outside linebacker), but Arp athlete DeMarvion Overshown is quickly shooting up recruiting boards across the country. This week alone, he notched offers from Alabama, LSU, Ole Miss, Texas A&M, UCLA and others. His film is really impressive. Check it out below. \nProspect to know \nEuless Trinity defensive end Izaih Filikitonga might be unranked, but he quietly holds offers from Oklahoma State, TCU, Utah and Utah State. Filikitonga was hurt most of his junior year, but he’s an athletic pass rusher with potential. He is a prospect I first identified last spring as one that could rack up a number of P5 offers. Check out his film below. Author", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T09:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T08:45:10.162+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
