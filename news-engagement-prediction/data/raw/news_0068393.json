His biological son Randall ( Sterling K. Brown ) took him on a road trip to Memphis so that William could show him where he started his music career. He sadly died during the trip. CHILLS. The music in this episode is amazing too. #ThisIsIs \n— Sharon Tharp (@sharontharp) February 22, 2017 Who was not laughing & sobbing at the same time when the ducks came walking across the road. There's your ducks William #ThisIsUs \n— Vicki Wheeler (@vwc1961) February 22, 2017 Never have I ever loved a character as much as William. My heart feels a little broken, and my living floor a little flooded. #ThisIsUs \n— Momma Bear (@NewMommaBear) February 22, 2017 Sobbed uncontrollably at William's death on #ThisIsUs , I have no clue how to prepare for Jack's.
