Pin \nNicole arrives at the Kiriakis mansion and ignores a call from Deimos, flashing to telling him that he's a murderer. Brady appears and she cries on his shoulder about Chloe nursing her baby. She tells him all about Deimos striking out against Andre and Dario. Brady's shocked and had no idea. \nIn Prague, Sonny, Paul, Steve, Kayla, Marlena and Rafe arrive at the masquerade ball in masks. Everyone has an earpiece and hears Resnick telling them Shane's on hand in London and she asks them to cover the perimeter. Marlena orders Rafe to dance with her and Kayla worries Stefano won't show. Sonny asks some guy if Rudolpho Meradi has checked in yet but the man rudely tells him this isn't a beer garden. Steve romances Kayla, telling her life is short and he won't let her go again. They kiss while Sonny tells Paul that he's a spy, just like his dad, and Sonny finds it exciting. Paul says it's not always this glam. He recalls hiding out at the docks with fish heads. Sonny gets them some martinis and flirts wildly with Paul, who is glad Sonny's there with him. Resnik tells the group that a car pulled up. They think Stefano is in the building.

She gives him one more chance but if there's anymore violence, she'll leave him. She leaves. Victor walks in and pours drinks for both himself and Deimos.
