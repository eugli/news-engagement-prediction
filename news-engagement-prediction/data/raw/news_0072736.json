This piece is titled \"La La Land.\" (Scott Smeltzer / Weekend) \"I wouldn't even call it a hobby; it's almost a lifestyle,\" Koizumi's movie-going companion RJ Brownfield said. \"We'll get into the most heated arguments you've ever see in your life over film. But it's amazing the stuff he'll go out of his way to learn.\"\nSince 2010, Koizumi has composed his annual top 50 movies list based on stunning performances, outstanding storytelling or compelling themes.\nBut it wasn't until last year that he began illustrating the artwork to accompany each of his top picks. He has two sketchbooks, one for the films he saw in 2015 and another for 2016.\n\"I decided to take a creative approach instead of just putting everything in a list form,\" Koizumi said. \"I've been drawing since I was a little kid, just drawing the characters I would see.\"\nThe iconic characters of the video game world such as Super Mario and Donkey Kong were his first muses.\nKoizumi started to be attracted to film around age 18 when he ordered Quentin Tarantino's \"Pulp Fiction\" and Edward Zwick's \"The Last Samurai\" through Blockbuster.\nMovie art Scott Smeltzer / Weekend Dale Koizumi, 26, a senior art student at Cal State Fullerton, draws movie characters and scenes from his top 50 list of movies.

This piece is titled \"Jungle Book.\" (Scott Smeltzer / Weekend) \"Those films really got me into thinking about the directing, writing, acting and visuals,\" Koizumi said.\nIn early January, he began to post the drawings of the 50 movies he saw last year on Instagram and his Facebook page, starting with his last to his first choices.\n\"I thought it was impressive that he did all that work,\" said Wendy Grieb, a professor of animation at Cal State Fullerton. \"His style is between cartoony and realistic. It's not like you couldn't recognize any of the characters he drew, and that's a skill in itself.\"\nThe posted artwork, which includes depictions of movie scenes and characters, comes with short movie reviews written by Koizumi.\nHis posts encompass animated films like No. 42 on his list, \"The Little Prince,\" which has a retired aviator telling a young girl a story about his encounters in the Sahara Desert, and horror movies like No. 44, \"The Neon Demon,\" about a model who moves from a small town in Georgia to Los Angeles.\nHigher on Koizumi's lineup are films that have generated Oscar buzz this year, like his No. 3 choice, \"La La Land,\" which he said in his review has \"nostalgic value that pays homage to the golden age musicals that'll bring you to the city of stars.\"\nHis No. 10 picture, \"Moonlight,\" a coming-of-age drama set in Miami, is split into three images, each depicting a different stage of the main character's life.\nKoizumi plans to spend Sunday at an Oscar party hosted each year by his friend Michael Canas. There, guests will be given lists of all the nominated films and actors in the 24 categories, and they can place check marks next to the ones they believe will win.\nMovie art Scott Smeltzer / Weekend Dale Koizumi, 26, a senior art student at Cal State Fullerton, draws movie characters and scenes from his top 50 list of movies.
