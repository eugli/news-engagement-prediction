PUBLISHED: 05:12, Tue, Feb 14, 2017 | UPDATED: 05:29, Tue, Feb 14, 2017 GETTY Donald Trump's travel ban is facing further legal issues \nUS District Judge Leonie Brinkema ruled the travel ban was found on an unconstitutional religious bias, which violates the First Amendment prohibitions on favouring one region over another. \nIn her 22-page ruling, Judge Brinkema said Trump's promises during the campaign to implement what came to be known as a \"Muslim ban\" provide evidence the current executive order unconstitutionally targets Muslims, according to ABC news. Related articles Donald Trump pledges to work closely with Canada \nShe added: “The president himself acknowledged the conceptual link between a Muslim ban and the EO (executive order).” \nVirginia Attorney General Mark Herring, a Democrat who brought the lawsuit against Trump in Virginia, hailed the judge’s ruling. \nMr Herring told ABC news: “Judge Brinkema's ruling gets right to the heart of our First Amendment ... claim.” \nInitially, Mr Herring had asked the Judge to enforce the injunction nationwide, but Brinkema refused stating the nationwide suspension of the ban, implemented from Washington, would cover the other areas. \nVirginia based its plea for an injunction on the basis that the ban would negatively affect the state.
