There’s one more rare fiver out there (Picture: REX) \nMr Short confirmed the note was legit after the woman sent it to him at The Tony Huggins-Haig Gallery in Scotland. \nShe told the gallery at her ‘time of life’ she did not need the note and asked them to use it to help people. \nThe Tony Huggins-Haig Gallery, which came up with the inscription project, has since decided to auction the fiver and donate the money to Children in Need. \nIt will also create another special note that will be included in the sale. \nMr Short created four £5 notes in 2016 that had the special inscriptions that could not be viewed by the naked eye. \nSo far three have been found. \nThe final note’s serial number is: AM32 885554.
