Yet research published in the journal JAMA found that any kind of exercise—whether it's core strengthening, aerobic exercise, or stretching—is the best way to ease pain and reduce the risk of another back pain attack.\nThe nice thing about gentle stretching is that it's feasible to do when you're in pain—and often provides the fastest relief, says Jamie Costello, fitness director at the Pritikin Longevity Center + Spa , who recommends these 5 stretches for the next time back pain strikes.\nA few tips to keep in mind before you get started: Try to hold each stretch for at least 10 seconds and preferably 30 seconds or longer. The pain-relieving benefits will increase the longer you hold these stretches, says Costello. What's more, these stretches will feel even better if you enjoy them. Rather than rush through the moves, Costello recommends turning on soothing music and using this stretching time as a chance to relax and renew (here are 6 ways to manage your chronic back pain ).\nSubscribe X Close State AL AK AS AZ AR AA AE AP CA CO CT DE DC FL GA GU HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND MP OH OK OR PW PA RI SC SD TN TX VI UT VT VA WA WV WI WY Your Privacy Rights Canadian Customers\nSubscribe X Close State AL AK AS AZ AR AA AE AP CA CO CT DE DC FL GA GU HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND MP OH OK OR PW PA RI SC SD TN TX VI UT VT VA WA WV WI WY Your Privacy Rights Canadian Customers\nChild’s Pose 1/5 Child’s Pose This common yoga posture gently stretches the muscles of the low back, which are likely contracted if you’re in pain (here are 7 more yoga poses you can do even if you're suffering from back pain ).\nBegin on your hands and knees on the floor, with your hands under your shoulders and knees under your hips. Reach out directly in front of you, extending your arms and placing your palms flat on the floor. Slowly sit your hips back toward your heels, dropping your head and chest downward as your arms extend further. If this stretch is too much, place a pillow under your belly to prop yourself up a bit and lessen the stretch of the low back muscles. Stay here for 20-30 seconds or even longer.\n(Got 10 minutes?

Your spine should be parallel to the ground in this position. Then, round your back, stretching your mid-back between your shoulder blades—similar to how a cat stretches by rounding its back. Hold for 5 seconds, then relax and let your stomach fall downward as you gently arch your low back and hold here for 5 seconds. Repeat these movements for 30 seconds or longer.\nLow Back Twist 3/5 fizkes/Getty Images Low Back Twist This movement not only helps to stretch your lower back but also your glutes, which can tighten when you're experiencing low back pain, ultimately causing more pain (check out these 5 things your glutes are trying to tell you ).\nBegin by lying on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Extend your arms out to the side in a \"T\" position. Keep your shoulders on the ground as you gently roll both knees to one side. Stay here for 20-30 seconds, then return to the starting position and repeat on the other side. If the stretch is too much for you, place a pillow or stack of blankets under your knees when you twist to each side.\nPrevention Premium: How 10 Minutes Of Daily Stretching Can Undo Decades Of Sore, Neglected Muscles\nKnee-to-Chest Stretch 4/5 fizkes Knee-to-Chest Stretch Similar to the other stretches here, this move lengthens contracted low back muscles.\nBegin by lying on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Bring your hands to rest either behind your knees or right below your kneecaps. Slowly bring both knees toward your chest, using your hands to gently pull your knees. Hold here for 20-30 seconds, then return to the starting position.\nThe Pelvic Tilt 5/5 Thomas Macdonald The Pelvic Tilt When you're suffering from low back pain, you might feel as if your entire pelvic area is immovable. This stretch can help you start to bring some movement back to this area gently (these 12 hip-opening yoga poses can also help).\nBegin by lying on the floor with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Try to relax your low back, keeping it in a neutral position (which means you should feel a slight curve in your low back if you place the top of your hand under your back). Turn \"on\" your core muscles and then flatten your low back against the floor by slightly tilting your pelvis upward. Repeat 12 to 15 times.\nMORE: 6 Simple Sciatica Stretches You Can Do In Bed\nAdvertisement", "external_links": ["http://www.fitin10slimandstrong.com/site?keycode=260433&utm_source=prevention.com&utm_medium=textlink&utm_campaign=5StretchesThatCanEaseYourLowerBackPain&utm_content=049430&utm_term=Fitness", "http://images.rodale.com/acc/pvn/2028039_pvn_flyout/2028039_pvn_flyout_516x360_bg.png);", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Ffitness%2F5-stretches-to-ease-your-lower-back-pain%3Futm_source%3Dplus.google.com%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsharebutton", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?s=100&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Ffitness%2F5-stretches-to-ease-your-lower-back-pain%3Futm_source%3Dfacebook.com%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsharebutton&p", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Ffitness%2F5-stretches-to-ease-your-lower-back-pain%2Fslide%2F4&media=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fsites%2Fprevention.com%2Ffiles%2Fgettyimages-637024984-kneechest-fizkes.jpg&description=Knee-to-Chest%20Stretch%20http://www.prevention.com/fitness/5-stretches-to-ease-your-lower-back-pain/slide/4", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=5%20Stretches%20To%20Ease%20Your%20Lower%20Back%20Pain%20&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Ffitness%2F5-stretches-to-ease-your-lower-back-pain%3Futm_source%3Dt.co%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsharebutton&via=preventionmag", "http://images.rodale.com/acc/pvn/2028039_pvn_flyout/2028039_submit.png)", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Ffitness%2F5-stretches-to-ease-your-lower-back-pain%2Fslide%2F3&media=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fsites%2Fprevention.com%2Ffiles%2Fgettyimages-612824772-bellytwist-fizkes.jpg&description=Low%20Back%20Twist%20http://www.prevention.com/fitness/5-stretches-to-ease-your-lower-back-pain/slide/3", "http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2481158", "https://www.pritikin.com/", "http://www.rodaleinc.com/your-privacy-rights", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Ffitness%2F5-stretches-to-ease-your-lower-back-pain%2Fslide%2F5&media=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fsites%2Fprevention.com%2Ffiles%2Fea_lybackstretch_a_f.jpg&description=The%20Pelvic%20Tilt%20http://www.prevention.com/fitness/5-stretches-to-ease-your-lower-back-pain/slide/5"], "published": "2017-02-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:22:54.444+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
