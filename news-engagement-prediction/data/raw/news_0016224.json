Trends Viral \nThe lungfish was euthanized Sunday by an animal care team at the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago, where he has lived since they acquired him in 1933. Grandad was said to be in his mid-90s. As we pay tribute to Granddad, here’s a look back at how he first came to Shedd in 1933. #SheddGranddad https://t.co/N8zmbhS74k pic.twitter.com/oPVFSCzy3r — Shedd Aquarium (@shedd_aquarium) 6 февраля 2017 г. \nThe team said they reached the “difficult decision” to end Grandad’s life, due to his rapidly declining health, in a statement shared on Monday. \n“Grandad was not only Shedd’s longest-lived resident but also the oldest fish in any public zoo or aquarium in the world,” the statement read. \nGrandad was seen by more than 104 million guests during his time at the aquarium and although his exact age is unknown, Australian lungfish can reach age 100 and the team “think he was close to it.” Chicago's Shedd Aquarium euthanizes 90+ year old Australian Lungfish \"Granddad\" https://t.co/iIvMVpPUDA via @AP pic.twitter.com/Q2K0Y3pBUe", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T06:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T04:20:51.634+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
