This was the first time it closed its doors since it started business nine months ago. \nThe protests followed the decision by Trump’s administration to put a four-month hold on letting refugees into the United States and to temporarily bar travelers from Yemen, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan and Somalia. \nThe order, which is being challenged in U.S. courts, left some travelers stranded and others held at airports on arrival. It provoked an outpouring of anger and dismay from immigrants, refugees and supporters. \nMany store owners and workers who shut up shop were going to rally and hold public sundown prayers outside Brooklyn Borough Hall. \n“We’re going to go out and support all our brothers and sisters who are detained in airports and in other countries that can’t get back,” Alaodyi said. “This is just not fair.” \nNew York City is home to many immigrants from Yemen, a country of about 24 million in the Arabian Peninsula. Many live in Brooklyn, but some are in Manhattan, Queens and the Bronx. \nGolden Deli, a Yemeni-owned bodega in Manhattan, was swelling with customers who picked up early lunches before it closed. Nermin Radoncic, 22, walked up shortly after workers pulled down the shutters at noon. \nRadoncic, who lives nearby but is moving to Queens, was disappointed he could not buy a pastrami and Swiss sandwich on his last day in the neighborhood. But he said he supported the protest. \n“They make the bomb sandwiches,” Radoncic said of Golden Deli. “This is like the best deli out here. Trump is a jerk.” \n(Reporting by Gina Cherelus; Editing by Daniel Wallis and David Gregorio) Share This:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T04:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T01:24:05.748+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
