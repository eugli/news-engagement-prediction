(Courtesy Erin Schreurs)\nWith attempts to starve himself and overdose on pills unsuccessful, his plan turned to travelling to Switzerland.\nHe died on Sept. 8, 2016, with the assistance of Dignitas, a Swiss non-profit organization that helps people with chronic or terminal illnesses end their lives.\n\n\nToday, a group of politicians and advocates, including NDP MP Murray Rankin, held a news conference on Parliament Hill asking the Liberals to fix a \"flawed\" and overly restrictive law that causes prolonged patient suffering or forces Canadians to die abroad.\nCalls to fix law \"I'm sad to say it's clear now that the problems identified by experts both in the medical and legal fields are now the reality for many suffering Canadians,\" said Rankin, a former law professor who served on the special committee that advised the government on medical aid in dying.\nCanada's new law, which came into effect on June 17, 2016, limits assisted death to mentally competent adults who have serious and incurable illness, disease or disability where death is imminent.\nIt excluded some of the most contentious recommendations from a parliamentary committee that studied the issue, including extending the right to die to \"mature minors\" and the mentally ill, and allowing advance consent for patients with degenerative disorders.\nJosh Paterson, executive director of the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, said at the news conference too many Canadians are disqualified.\nNDP says government's assisted-dying legislation is failing Canadians 1:11\n\"People have been cut out of their constitutional right because of the requirement that a person's death be reasonably foreseeable,\" he said.\nPolitical interests trump patient care Logistical challenges forced Schreurs into \"task mode,\" making all the required arrangements from travel schedules to medical appointments for her husband and foreign money transfers. All in, the costs were about $30,000 for her, their son and daughter to accompany him to Switzerland so he could die.\nShe doesn't want others to go through the same experience. She believes those who passed the law put political interests ahead of patient care. \n\"They already know what the courts recommended, they've already had the special committee. What gives them the right to not follow those recommendations? Why do they think they know better?\" she asked.\nCurrent legislation came after a unanimous landmark ruling on Feb. 6, 2015, by the Supreme Court of Canada, which found the ban on physician-assisted death violated Canadians' charter rights.\nLegal appeal underway The case involved two B.C. women who wanted end their lives with medical help. Both died before the court ruled.\nGloria Taylor, who had a neurodegenerative disease, eventually died of an infection. Kay Carter, then 89, travelled to Switzerland. \nIndependent reviews of three issues identified in Bill C-14 as requiring further study is now underway, with a report due by December 2018. \n\n\nJulia Lamb, a B.C. woman with spinal muscular atrophy, and the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association have  launched a legal challenge of the new law , arguing it is too narrow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T01:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:39:44.793+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
