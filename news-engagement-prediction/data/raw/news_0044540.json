The 2004 Olympic silver medallist garnered 48 per cent of the vote, ahead of Kell Brook, Terence Crawford and Jeff Green. \nPacquiao, 37, came out of a brief retirement to defeat American Jesse Vargas in a unanimous points decision in November - after which he said he was open to fighting Floyd Mayweather if the latter ever comes out of retirement. \nMayweather, 39, beat Pacquiao by unanimous decision in May 2015 and announced his retirement four months later with a 49-0 record. \nKhan's last bout ended in a knockout defeat by Saul Alvarez last May. - CNA/rw", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T10:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T06:27:57.152+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
