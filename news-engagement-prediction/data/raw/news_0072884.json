Can't you see this country is being taken over by hate extremist pensioners. \n\"Can't even get an appt at the doctors because pensioners just skip the queue, and claim all benefits. It has to stop.\" \nWithin moments Allen had received dozens of hateful messages, with two men blaming her for the death of her son, who died when the umbilical cord became wrapped around his neck. \nSorry, this content isn't available on your device. \nSorry, this content isn't available on your device. \nTrolls also doctored a poll that Allen had created on Twitter to make it appear to ask 15 to 35-year-olds whether they felt more marginalised by pensioners or Muslims. \nAnd in another hacked poll the same group were asked whether they thought Allen or Hitler had had a more negative effect on Europe over the last 100 years. \nShe wrote: \"My poll was for 15-35 year olds. It was highjacked by middle aged angry white men with St George cross avatars (check out my timeline).\" \nAllen later announced that she was taking a break from Twitter, saying: \"My timeline is full of the most disgusting, sexist, misogynistic, racist s***. Really, new levels. I'm no masochist so I'll be back x\" \nAnother update read: \"Hi, I'm Dennis, I'll be looking after lily's twitter for a while. I can only communicate in gif form,and I'm going on a hate blocking spree.\" Last updated Sun 26 Feb 2017 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T07:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:52:49.386+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
