The nominees gathered for the Academy’s annual luncheon and photo session on Monday. by Nominees for the 89th Oscars were celebrated at a luncheon held at the Beverly Hilton, Monday, February 6, 2017.

As if Emma Stone , Natalie Portman , and Ryan Gosling did not have enough opportunities to mingle during award season already, the 2017 class of nominees convened in Los Angeles on Monday for another celebratory get-together—the Academy’s annual Oscar nominee luncheon. Vanity Fair ’s Rebecca Keegan has the scoop about Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs’s pointedly political remarks, but we want to pay closer attention to one of our favorite award-season rituals: the yearly photo, during which the Oscar nominees are awkwardly sandwiched onto risers for a glamorous grade-school-style photo. Consider it Hollywood’s best Where’s Waldo homage! This year’s portrait provided plenty of incredible scenes and adorably random couplings. Our favorites: Ryan Gosling (top row, center right) standing with his arms crossed, seemingly very unimpressed by the class photo ritual, even though he had a prime position standing just above Nicole Kidman , Dev Patel , and Mel Gibson —all of whom looked infinitely more enthused to be standing on risers. In his defense, though, Gosling was one of the first to take the risers meaning that he had to clap as the many other nominees took the stage. And, as this photo attests, applauding your fellow Oscar nominees is serious, fatiguing business. By Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images. Having either missed or outright ignored the suggested dress code, Pharrell standing beside the life-sized gold Oscar in a green baseball hat, NASA sweatshirt, and ripped blue jeans. In fact, if you look closely enough, you can see the statuette give him a little side-eye. By Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images. \nHis friend and sometime collaborator, Justin Timberlake , meanwhile, sits (bottom row, right) looking dapper alongside the always-stylish Loving actress Ruth Negga . \nEmma Stone , Matt Damon , a very pregnant Natalie Portman , and Octavia Spencer making up the most fun foursome of the picture, sitting on the bottom left. They even drew a laugh out of Gosling! By Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images. \nMoonlight co-writer Tarell Alvin McCraney (top row, center), in a navy blue suit, grinning and giving the camera eight fingers—presumably to signify the film’s eight nominations. His enthusiasm pulls focus from Denzel Washington , Isabelle Huppert , and Jeff Bridges , to the left. \nCasey Affleck ’s hair and beard volume being so great that it literally overshadows the actor’s Manchester By the Sea co-star Michelle Williams , in the third row from the top, on the far left. Also, did you know that Affleck is friends with Octavia Spencer? By Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images. Hacksaw Ridge ’s re-recording mixer Kevin O'Connell may spend his career behind the camera but, on Monday, he made the argument for why he should be front and center more often. Standing directly to the right of the Oscar statuette (in the second row from the bottom, right below Lin-Manuel Miranda ), O’Connell brings enough joyfulness and giddy gestures to make up for both Ryan Gosling and Pharrell’s movie-star malaise. This show of emotion is all the more impressive considering he has reason to be exhausted by the whole thing: O’Connell has been Oscar-nominated 21 times without a single win. Which nominee do you think is the real star of this year’s Academy class photo?
