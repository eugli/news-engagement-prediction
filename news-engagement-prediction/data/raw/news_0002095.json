My husband and I were both born and raised here and went to the same school. So, we purchased the land and we have been living in our home for just a little over a year. We have three little boys Blake (8), Callen (6) and Nash (2). They are always at the center of our attention and all aspects of our home are created around them first. \nMy husband and I both fell in love with the look of the classic gray farmhouse with lots of windows for the exterior and the inside of our home is and open concept. I am the decor enthusiast of the family so my style is poured all throughout our home. A little mid century, eclectic with classic and modern farmhouse touches here and there. However, we both encourage our kids to be creative so we used one entire wall in the boys playroom for a chalkboard wall! I love to tweak our home almost everyday just by rearranging furniture or swapping out decor items from room too room to make each space feel fresh. \nThanks, Lauren! \n• Interested in sharing your home with Apartment Therapy?
