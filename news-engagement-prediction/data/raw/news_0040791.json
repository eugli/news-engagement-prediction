The bath oil contained methylated spirit, they said.\nIt was unclear whether those selling the product were marketing it as a cheaper substitute for alcoholic spirits such as vodka.\n\"Forty two people have been admitted to medical institutions of whom 25 have died,\" investigators said in the statement.\n\"Investigators and the police are conducting searches at markets where the liquid was first obtained. More than 100 points of sale have been identified.\"\nThe Interfax news agency said the death toll had been revised up to 33 since the release of the initial statement.\nPrime Minister Dmitry Medvedev told a government meeting he wanted to look at banning products that could cause so many deaths and said the country's criminal code was being amended to toughen the punishment for people caught selling them.\nInvestigators, who said they had opened a criminal case into the poisonings, said they had confiscated more than 2,000 litres of spirit.\nStanislav Zubovsky, a local prosecutor, told the Interfax news agency that police were continuing to search residential areas and that \"the number (of deaths) will increase further.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T12:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T05:42:09.930+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
