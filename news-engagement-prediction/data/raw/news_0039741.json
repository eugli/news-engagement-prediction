The figures are for the year ending March 2016. \nJo Bulman, ONS statistician, said: “While overall household spending didn’t change much in real terms since the previous year, we did see some interesting shifts in the types of things people are spending their money on.” Spending on alcohol, cigarettes and drugs has fallen below £12 a week. \nThe report showed that households have still not fully recovered from the financial crisis , with family spending still below the levels seen before 2007. \nAverage total spending – adjusted for inflation – was unchanged from a year earlier at £528.90 a week. Low income families continued to spend a higher proportion of their spending on food and energy compared with people on higher incomes. \nTransport was the biggest costs for households over the year, averaging £72.70 a week or 14% of spending. It was closely followed by housing – excluding mortgage interest payments and council tax – fuel and power, which averaged at £72.50 a week. Average weekly family spending in the year ending March 2016 Transport: £72.70 Housing, fuel and power: £72.50 Recreation and culture: £68 Food and non-alcoholic drinks: 56.80 Restaurants and hotels: £45.10 Miscellaneous goods and services: £39.70 Household goods and services: £35.50 Clothing and footwear: £23.50 Alcoholic drinks, tobacco and narcotics: £11.40 Health: £7.20 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T18:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T13:06:53.330+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
