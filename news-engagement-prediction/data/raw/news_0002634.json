(Photo: Market District Carmel) 107 CONNECT 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nForget the game. Take me to the nachos – all 100 pounds of them. \nNachos rank No. 4 in the top 10 Super Bowl foods people want to eat, right behind No. 1 pizza, No. 2 chili and No. 3 wings, according to The Daily Meal ’s review of Google trends over the past month. \nThe 100-pound nachos mountain on display this week at Market District in Carmel is a 4-foot-high crunchy, cheesy, meaty heap. It requires 30 pounds of tortilla chips, 40 pounds of shredded chicken and ground beef and about 10 pounds of beans. \nFifteen pounds of queso cheese gets poured over the whole thing. \nAnd then there’s the garnishes: 2 pounds each of onions, olives, jalapeños, lettuce, tomato, sliced radishes, sour cream, guacamole and pico de gallo top. \nThe whole pile costs $200, but you have to build it yourself, and that takes about three hours and the entire dining room table. \nCall IndyStar reporter Liz Biro at (317) 444-6264.
