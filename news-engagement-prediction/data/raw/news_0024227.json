The governor has no choice but to invite the leader of the majority party. \nConstitutional conventions of this type are as important or sacred as the text of the Constitution. Conventions provide the flesh which clothes the dry bones of the textual provisions. \nParliamentary democracy is the basic structure of our Constitution. Every governor takes an oath under Article 159 “to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution and submit himself to the service and well -being of people of the state”. \nHe must hold the scales impartially between various factors in the politics of the state. By depriving the people of Tamil Nadu from having an elected government, the governor seems to be in violation of his oath. \nPanneerselvam’s resignation cannot be withdrawn \nOn February 4, AIADMK legislative party elected VK Sasikala . The name was proposed by the outgoing chief minister O Panneerselvam who had put in his papers to make way for Sasikala. Within hours of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s death on December 5, 2016, Panneerselvam was administered oath as the CM by the same governor. Thus the delay this time on the part of governor in swearing in Sasikala is clearly deliberate. \nPanneerselvam has now revolted against Sasikala and plans to withdraw his resignation. He does not know that once a resignation has been accepted, it cannot be withdrawn. Meanwhile, Sasikala has demonstrated support of 131 MLAs. The majority mark in 234 Assembly is 117. Thus the MLAs are solidly behind Sasikala. \nMoreover, the governor cannot hide behind the impending decision of the Supreme Court on a petition challenging the acquittal of Sasikala by the Karnataka high court. If Sasikala is convicted, she will have no option but to step down. \nRao is finally reaching Chennai today. As a lawyer he knows that he hardly has any choice. One hopes instead of playing politics, he would behave like a statesman and clear the clouds of uncertainty and appoint Sasikala as chief minister. \nFaizan Mustafa is vice-chancellor, NALSAR University of Law, Hyderabad \nThe views expressed are personal tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T17:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:54:32.792+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
