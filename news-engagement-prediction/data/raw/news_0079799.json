So if we get normal precipitation in March it could be translated to bigger runoff,\" Unduche said.\nSoggy soil could mean spring floods in west, north Don't trade that snow shovel for a sandbag-filler just yet Southwestern Manitoba faces high risk of spring floods\nLakes in Whiteshell Provincial Park are also at risk of major flooding, he said. But it all depends on how much rain or snow falls in the coming months.\nIf there's average precipitation in the coming months, the flooding should not create lengthy highway closures.\n\"If you can order another March just like January and February, we would be in much better condition then, too. But keeping in mind there is a potential for this [flood]. So we have to prepare,\" Infrastructure Minister Blaine Pedersen said.\nThe Red River in Winnipeg is expected to crest within a week at about 15 feet above normal winter ice level at James Avenue, the level of a moderate flood, as melt from the recent thaw south of the border reaches the city.\nA second, larger crest of 17 to 19.5 feet James is expected after all the snow in the basin melts. That would be a moderate spring flood, similar to what the city experienced in 2005 and 2007.\nIce, however, could push the Red River up to 22 feet James, a level that would require extensive sandbagging along low-lying Winnipeg properties.\nProvincial flood forecaster Fisaha Unduche, Infrastructure Minister Blaine Pedersen and infrastructure assistant deputy minister Doug McMahon address reporters at the Manitoba Legislative building Monday. (Bartley Kives/CBC)\nThis outlook is in line with what provincial forecasters have been predicting all season.\nIn early December, the combination of extremely wet soil-moisture conditions, above-normal water levels and a snowy winter forecast led Manitoba Infrastructure's hydrologic forecast centre to state there is a \"probable chance of moderate to major flooding at some locations\" in southern Manitoba this spring.\nIn the January forecast, provincial flood forecasters refined that outlook to state the Red, Pembina, Souris, Roseau and lower Assiniboine rivers are at risk of major flooding this spring.\nThey pegged flood concerns along the upper Assiniboine River, Winnipeg River and parts of eastern Manitoba as moderate to major.\nCautious optimism ahead of Manitoba's next flood forecast\nSouthern Manitoba has received a lot of snow this winter, but snow accumulation is just one factor among several that determines whether a flood will occur and how severe it will be.\nThe other factors include soil moisture at freeze-up, lake and river levels, frost depth, the rate of snowmelt and the precipitation during snowmelt, hydrologists and meteorologists say.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T21:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T15:57:41.893+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
