Its fate has been a mystery for 1,500 years and the temple vessel has become the stuff of legends.\nJerusalem and its temple was destroyed by Titus, a Roman general who became emperor nine years later. A relief on his victory arch in Rome, which still stands, shows the Jerusalem menorah and other war trophies being carried in a parade.\nMost historians believe the Jerusalem menorah was lost in the Vandal's Sack of Rome in 455. But legends have persisted that it was thrown in the Tiber River and is still there, that it was buried in a cave or that it is hidden in the Vatican.\n\"A lot of people will be disappointed to discover that these urban legends are not true,\" said Rome's chief Rabbi Ricardo Di Segni.\nHowever, the exhibition will contain what may be the next best thing - the Magdala Stone. It was found in 2009 in an archaeological dig that uncovered an ancient synagogue on the shores of the Sea of Galilee in Israel.\nIt shows a seven-branched menorah, similar to the one depicted on the Arch of Titus in Rome, and is believed to have been carved by an artist who saw the missing Jerusalem menorah in the temple before the Roman's destroyed it.\nCatholic and Jewish officials said the exhibition, called Menorah - Cult, History and Myth, was another sign of radically improved inter-religious relations since 1965, when the Second Vatican Council repudiated the concept of collective Jewish guilt for the death of Jesus.\n(Reporting By Philip Pullella; Editing by Janet Lawrence)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T15:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:31:42.195+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
