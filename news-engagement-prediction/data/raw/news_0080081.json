(Reuters) \nVeteran poet and lyricist Javed Akhtar slammed cricketing legend Virender Sehwag and Olympic silver medalist Yogeshwar Dutt over their responses to 20-year-old Gurmehar Kaur’s video. Akhtar took shots at the players by calling them hardly literate. Akhtar went on Twitter and said that if a hardly literate player and a wrestler trolled a pacifist daughter of a martyr, it was understandable but questioned about what was wrong with some of the educated folks of the country. He further went head and criticised MoS Kiren Rijiju for falsely accusing the left by saying that they had celebrated the killing of soldiers but remained mum on the matter with ABVP. He termed Rijiju’s behaviour as grossly biased. Although Yogeshwar Dutt responded to Javed Akhtar with a hard-hitting reply. If a hardly literate player or a wrestler troll a pacifist daughter of a martyr its understandable but whats wrong with some educated folks \n— Javed Akhtar (@Javedakhtarjadu) February 28, 2017 @Javedakhtarjadu जी,आपने कविता-कहानी की रचना की तो हमने भी कुछ कारनामे कर छोटा ही सही भारत के लिए विश्वपटल पर इतिहास रचा है @virendersehwag http://t.co/XIGOJ1hPMp \n— Yogeshwar Dutt (@DuttYogi) February 28, 2017 \nEarlier today, following Virender Sehwag’s jab at Gurmehar Kaur’s video about free speech, Olympic medalist and wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt posted his version of it on social media. Dutt posted a meme followed by a series of tweets with the hashtag #Bharatjaisijagahnai; something that Virender Sehwag had also used in his tweet. The concerned meme says that Hitler did not kill the jews, the gas did; Osama Bin Laden did not kill people, bombs did; ‘ Salman Khan ’ did not kill the black buck, the bullet did.” The tweet was directed at Kaur’s placard which said, “Pakistan did not kill my dad, the war killed him”. \nVirender Sehwag had shared his own version of the placard saying that it was his bat that had scored the two triple centuries but not him. These series of events come after violence at the Ramjas College allegedly by the hands of the Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad, who had disrupted a conference at the college on ‘Culture of Protests’, which was to be attended by Jawahar Lal Nehru students Umar Khalid and Shehla Rashid. Just a few days after the alleged stoning at Ramjas College and the violence that followed, Gurmehar Kaur, daughter of the late Captain Mandeep Singh, martyr of 1999 Kargil War, had changed her Facebook display picture to one with her holding the placard saying, “I AM A STUDENT OF DELHI UNIVERSITY. I AM NOT AFRAID OF ABVP. I AM NOT ALONE. EVERY STUDENT OF INDIA IS WITH ME. #FIGHTBACKDU #STUDENTSAGAINSTABVP”.
