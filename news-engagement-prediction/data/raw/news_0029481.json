Just ask Twenty One Pilots . \nAfter winning the award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for their hit song \"Stressed Out,\" Twenty One Pilots members Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun immediately got up and removed their pants, choosing to walk up to the podium in their underwear. (Briefs > boxers, for this duo, BTW.) Yes, they really did drop trou on music's biggest night. But before you think it was a stunt, Tyler used the duo's acceptance speech to explain the OMG moment. \n\"This story, it starts in Columbus, Ohio, it was a few years ago and it was before Josh and I were able to make money playing music,\" he explained. \"I called him up, and I said, 'Hey Josh, want to come over to my rental house and watch the Grammys? As we were watching, we noticed every single one of us was in our underwear, and seriously, Josh said to me, and we were no one at the time, he turned to me and he said, 'If we ever go to the Grammys, if we ever win a Grammy, we should receive it just like this.'\" Photos \nGrammys 2017 Red Carpet Arrivals Kevin Winter/Getty Images for NARAS \nHis speech earned laughs and applause from many members of the audience, including Rihanna and Halsey , who were also nominated in the category. (Even host James Corden later felt inspired to drop trou!) \nHe finished his speech with an inspirational message, saying, \"I want everyone at home whose watching to know that you can be next. So watch out, OK, because anyone from anywhere can do anything.\" \nAnd they can do it without wearing pants. \nTo take home the award, Twenty One Pilots beat out The Chainsmokers and Halsey's \"Closer,\" Lukas Graham 's \"7 Years,\" Rihanna and Drake 's \"Work,\" and Sia and Sean Paul 's \"Cheap Thrills.\" \nFollowing the 2017 Grammys on CBS, tune back in to E! for our live After Party special at 11:30 p.m. ET/PT.
