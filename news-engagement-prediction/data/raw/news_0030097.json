No, I don’t fancy all of my friends \nOr have ‘twice as many options.’ My standards are sky high, baby. 2. It’s not just a phase \nI realised I was attracted to women when I was 11 years old. \nDuring that period, I also became attracted to gothic clothes, rock music, and black lipstick. \nBut, guess what? Sexuality tends to be a bit more permanent than bad fashion choices. \nBisexuality isn’t usually a phase – science says so. \nAnd even if it was , that wouldn’t make it less meaningful. \nMuch like my unfortunate experiments with black lipstick, it still happened. (Picture: Netflix) 3. And I’m definitely not confused \nYes, some people do transition from being bi to straight (or gay) but, pro tip – it’s usually safest to assume people know more about their own bedroom preferences than you do. 4. Yes, I’m still bisexual when I’m dating a man (or a woman) \nMy relationship status changes – my sexuality doesn’t. 5. Yes, I’m still bisexual even if I’ve only ever dated one gender \nI’ve dated both genders, but not all bisexual people have, and that’s okay. \nAttraction happens in the mind. I mean, you don’t have to have dated Tom Hiddleston to know you fancy him, right? (For the record, Tom, I’m single). 6. I’m not doing this for attention \nWe’re British – if I wanted attention, I’d express a dislike of tea. \nBeverage preferences are a matter of public interest, sexuality isn’t. (Picture: Getty) 7. No, not all women are bisexual \nYes, studies have indicated female sexuality is more fluid , but just because some of us have kissed a girl and liked it, doesn’t make all women bisexual. \nTime to put your threesome fantasies to bed. 8. On that note, no, I don’t want to have a threesome with you and your partner Ok, we’d make an exception for them (Picture: Getty) \nUnless you’re Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, in which case, yes, yes I do. 9. I don’t prefer one gender over the other \nWhile I might be more likely to date men, I wouldn’t say I prefer them. \nThat makes it sound as if I’d always rather be with a man, and that couldn’t be further from the truth. I want whoever I’m with. 10. Actually, it might not be about gender at all \nYes, we tricked you – I apologise on behalf of bisexuals worldwide. \nDespite the fact that ‘bi’ is a prefix that means having two (like a bicycle has two wheels, and a bisected cake has two halves (both are mine), bisexuality doesn’t always mean being attracted to only two genders. Bisexuality is a spectrum, and so is gender (Picture: Getty) \nFor one thing, gender isn’t that simple . \nSome people just don’t identity with being male or female. \nSo some bisexual people would call themselves ‘genderblind.’ Or ‘pansexual’–‘pan’ meaning ‘all’ and not an illicit attraction to frying pans – to indicate more than one gender exists and we’re totally down with that. 11. Not all bisexuals are the same \nBisexuality is a broad spectrum, and it means different things to different people. \nThere really are no rules, and we like it that way.
