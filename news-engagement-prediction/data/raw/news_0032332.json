He also shared some of the plot details to Norton. “It would be Bill and Ted in their 50s,” Reeves said. “I mean, that just makes me laugh right there.” “Basically, they’re supposed to write a song to save the world and they haven’t done that,” Reeves continued, laughing. “So the pressure of having to save the world, you know their marriages are falling apart, their kids are kind of mad at them, but then someone comes from the future and tells them if they don’t write the song, it’s not just the world now, it’s the universe. So they have to save the universe because time is breaking apart.” Reeves, after some prompting from Norton, then showcased some slick air-guitar skills.
