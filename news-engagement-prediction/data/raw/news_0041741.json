'As a culture in the US, we've focused on things that didn't matter as much. Now, everything is brought into perspective, and Twitter is at center of the most important conversations,' he said. Tens of thousands of people fill the streets of Washington, DC, to take part in the Women's March on January 21, 2017. Social media has been utilized to mobilize masses of people in large-scale protest movements Despite Twitter's crucial role as a platform for exchanging views, the company has not translated it into profit. Last week, Twitter posted the slowest revenue growth since it went public four years ago, sending shares down more than 10 percent on fears that rivals Snapchat and Facebook were winning the war for advertising.

Dorsey told analysts on a conference call last week that Twitter was investing in machine learning and searching for ways to engage advertisers. 'It will take time to show the results we all want to see, and we're moving forward aggressively. The whole world is watching Twitter,' he said. Quarterly revenue growth was the slowest since Twitter went public in 2013. Advertising revenue in the fourth quarter declined 0.5 percent year-over-year to $638 million, and the company said that advertising revenue growth would continue to lag user growth during 2017. 'There isn't a growth story here,' said Michael Pachter, a Wedbush Securities analyst. 'They have to convince advertisers that they will reach an expanding audience,' he said.
