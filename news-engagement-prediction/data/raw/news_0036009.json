And this is certainly one of those times, according to Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.). On Thursday, the Democrat used the House floor to compare life under President Donald Trump’s administration to “ The Upside Down ” — the creepy parallel universe in Netflix’s supernatural drama “ Stranger Things .” Standing next to a sign of the show’s logo that was tweaked to read “Trump Things,” he lamented how under Trump “right is wrong, up is down, black is white.” Cicilline cited the inconsistent decisions that the White House has made in the four weeks since Trump’s inauguration ― such as the signing of an executive order “to spend $20 billion on a border wall, while Flint, Michigan, still goes without clean drinking water.” “This is not a TV show, this is real life,” he said. “We have a president unlike any we have ever known,” he continued. “And like Mike, Dustin, Lucas and Eleven, we must remain focused on the task at hand, and hold this administration accountable, so we can escape from our own version of ‘The Upside Down.’” Watch Cicilline’s full speech in the clip above. Like Mike, Dustin, Lucas and Eleven from Stranger Things, we are now stuck in the Upside Down. pic.twitter.com/bDkwYz3ohm — David Cicilline (@RepCicilline) February 16, 2017 Related Coverage", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T12:14:24.701+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
