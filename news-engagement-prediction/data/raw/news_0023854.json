Photo: Alex Ellinghausen \n\"We've got to do a better job. So I've come to the conclusion there's a better way and it's a way built around enduring principles that have stood us in good stead and will stand our children in good stead. We need to see more of it.\" \nStefanovic pushed back, challenging the South Australian to name a piece of government legislation he was opposed to. Advertisement \n\"People were talking about this for months. Again, what took you so long to man up,\" the host demanded to know. \nSenator Bernardi said he'd hoped to rebuild and strengthened the Liberal Party from within but had reached the conclusion it was on \"a spiral downwards\". \n\"I've been joined at the hip with the Liberal Party for 30 years. This is a very tough call for me, it's tough for my colleagues and my friends and supporters in the Liberal Party. I know that it's difficult.\" \nï»¿ After the new crossbencher nominated the government's dumped plans to consider of a market-based emissions reduction scheme in late-2016 and any increase in taxes, Stefanovic tried again, asking why he couldn't name a single policy he was opposed to and why the outspoken critic of Malcolm Turnbull wouldn't quit the Senate. \n\"Ideas matter in politics,\" Senator Bernardi said. \n\"What I have realised ultimately I've been battling within the party against the very forces that try and subdue the very forces that try and subdue the real principles. \n\"Why has it been left to me to say that tax rises are wrong? Big government spending programs are wrong? Against the philosophy of the party. I shouldn't have to go into battle against the very ideas that the Liberal Party was founded upon all the time. That's the real challenge.\" \nChallenged over his dislike of Prime Minister, Senator Bernardi said he would not play \"the personality game\" or reveal details of his conversations with Mr Turnbull on Tuesday. \n\"I'm happy to work with anyone,\" he said. \n\"I understand full well the disappointment that many people feel in this space. I have got to do what is in the best interests of the nation in the long run.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:03:43.653+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
