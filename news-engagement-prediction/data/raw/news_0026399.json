During their 67-run partnership, Pujara was the aggressor even as Kohli was scoring at a quick pace. \nTheir 50 stand was achieved at run-a-ball strike rate. Just when Kohli was about to shift gears, a poor shot led to his downfall. \nAjinkya Rahane, having regained confidence after his first innings 82, followed team diktat hitting 25 off 31 balls with a couple of boundaries and a six off Mehedi Hasan Miraz. He was bowled trying to hit Shakib out of the park. \nWith declaration in mind, Ravindra Jadeja was promoted up the order to consolidate the lead before tea. \nJadeja was dropped by Miraz off the second delivery he faced and the ball went for a boundary. The next was dispatched over long-on fence. Meanwhile, Pujara completed his second half century off the match in 57 balls.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T16:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T12:46:08.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
