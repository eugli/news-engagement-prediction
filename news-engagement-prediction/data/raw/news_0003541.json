The public should give more encouragement for the sport to thrive across the country. \n“Last year, we had four shows in the Klang Valley. We look forward to heading to other states next year. \n“We have a big following in Johor and Penang and aim to stage similar shows in these two states next year. \n“At present, we focus on performances in the Klang Valley to build up our fan base and gain popularity,’’ he said. \nSyauqi added that besides local shows, the group also supported and attended those organised in the South-East Asia region such as in the Philippines, Thailand and Singapore. \n“We support wrestlers from South-East Asian countries and in return we get their support when we hold such events locally. \n“We are still trying to get affiliated with national sports bodies such as the National Sports Council and Youth and Sports Ministry but we have yet to be successful despite having made many attempts. \n“Wrestling is an entertainment sport that is very popular in the US, England, Mexico and other parts of the world. It should be recognised as a sport,’’ he pointed out. \nAmong the event’s sponsors were Cheras Corporation Sdn Bhd, Mil International Group, Konsortium Media Ad Berhad, World International Holidays Tours Sdn Bhd, Skohns Canteen, Red Bricks Event, An Honest Mistake and The Sukan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:49:58.092+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
