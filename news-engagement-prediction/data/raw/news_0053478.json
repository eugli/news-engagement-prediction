The G5 plus is also a bit smaller than its predecessor, as it sports a 5.2-inch 1080p display instead of a 5.5-inch one.Running Android 7 Nougat, the Moto G5 Plus should be powered by an octa-core Snapdragon 625 processor - good enough for a mid-range handset. The phone will be splash-resistant, having a 12 MP camera (with dual pixel auto focus) on the back, and a 5 MP camera on the front. Other features include LTE connectivity, fingerprint scanner, 2 GB of RAM, 64 GB of internal memory, and a 3000 mAh battery with TurboPower charging. Verizon could release the Moto G5 Plus on April 3, since that's the date seen on the phone's home screen. As previously reported, the smartphone might cost around $250 off contract, though it's unclear if Verizon will stick to this pricing. It's also unclear if the largest US carrier is planning to sell the smaller Moto G5 in addition to the G5 Plus.
