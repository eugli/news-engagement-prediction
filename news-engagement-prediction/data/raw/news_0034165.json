Thousands of drivers are on an indefinite strike since February 10 in the Delhi-NCR region to protest against “low fares” and “lack” of basic amenities. \nThe two leaders on hunger strike were admitted at RML, in view of their deteriorating condition, on Thursday. Following this a section of drivers of the union threatened of disrupting traffic movement in some parts of the city on Friday. \nThe situation is still a far cry from normal as waiting time for commuters continued to be for nearly 20 minutes instead of the usual two to five minutes. \n“I tried with both the services but was not able to book a cab. The apps kept saying there is some technical problem,” said Vandana Pandey, a resident of Krishna Nagar. \nWith very few cabs plying on the road, people were expected to pay almost twice the regular rate on Friday morning due to the high demand. \nStalemate over the cab crisis in Delhi-NCR continues as talks between the Delhi government and striking Ola and Uber drivers failed on Thursday.

While transport minister Satyendar Jain didn’t meet the protestors, he deputed member of State Transport Authority (STA) Kailash Gehlot to hold the meeting. \nLater, speaking to a few reporters, Jain said, “I would urge the police to take strict action against violent protestors who damaged property. This violence and vandalism on the roads cannot continue.” \nDrivers are demanding an increase in fares from the existing Rs 6 per km and also want the 25% commission the app-based aggregators charge on every booking to be discontinued.
