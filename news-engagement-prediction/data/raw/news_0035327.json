External Link: AFL Women's tweets @katemccarthy24 puts her foot down and delivers \nBelieved to be the only AFL player in history to wear a pacemaker, McCarthy left chasing Magpies opponents in her wake as she took five bounces from behind the centre circle all the way to the goal square before converting from point-blank range. \nShe also kicked another in the last quarter to send the Lions on their way to a hard-fought 4.3 (27) to 3.5 (23) victory, with Collingwood still searching for their maiden AFLW win. \nAn official crowd of 5,500 was on hand at the South Pine Sports Complex for Brisbane's first home game. \nA strong wind favouring one side of the ground and tough 34 degree heat contributed to the low scoring. \nThe Lions relished the conditions, dominated the first half and led by 10 points at halftime, but Collingwood's opening goal — which came in the third term via Jessica Cameron — seemed to spark them into action. \nIt was the team's first major in four quarters of football, having been held scoreless after quarter-time last week by Melbourne. \nThe visitors closed to within three points courtesy of goals from skipper Steph Chiocci on the three-quarter time siren and Sarah D'Arcy late on. \nIt took some desperate defensive acts from Brisbane — and a lack of nerve at the vital moments from Collingwood — to close it out. \nCollingwood's marquee star Moana Hope did not touch the ball until midway through the third term and finished with just two disposals, and also missed a set shot from a difficult angle in the last quarter that could have put her side in front. Winless sides play out first-ever draw \nWinless AFLW sides Greater Western Sydney and Fremantle played out the competition's first draw in a 43-43 thriller at Blacktown in Western Sydney.

Watch the final two minutes \nBoth teams posted their biggest score yet with Freo (6.7) having more scores and inside 50 entries than GWS (7.1). \nFreo led for much of the game but kicked more behinds than goals for a third straight game. \nFreo's Kira Phillips kicked the only first-quarter goal to set up the visitors' 9-0 lead at the first break. \nMatildas football representative Ellie Brush had the honour of kicking the Giants' first home goal, from a set shot in the second quarter. \nBoth teams posted two majors in the seconds term, which ended with Freo up by 11 points. \nGiants briefly held the lead in the third quarter and kicked three goals to two in that period, but trailed by five points going into the last quarter. \nPhoebe McWilliams, who spent much of the first half off the field with a knee issue, kicked her second goal to regain the lead for the Giants. \nFreo responded immediately with Ashley Sharp kicking her second major to grab the lead back for the visitors, but Aimee Schmidt levelled the score with a goal two minutes from full-time. \nLara Filocamo tallied a game-high 19 touches for Freo, while Erin McKinnon notched 32 hit-outs for GWS. \nAAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T11:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T10:18:52.547+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
