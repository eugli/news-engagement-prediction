'Pangolin meat' Credit: Weibo/Global Times \nP angolin smugglers in China can be served with prison sentences of ten years. \nBut there is huge demand for the nocturnal creature as its scales are highly-prized in Chinese traditional medicine as an ingredient which some believe can improve blood circulation. \nScales can sell for up to £2,000 on the black market, while a pangolin dish at Chinese restaurants would be expected to cost hundreds of pounds. \nAnimal protection campaigners believe up to 90,000 dead and alive pangolins have been seized by customs officials over the last ten years in China and Hong Kong. \nHeather Sohl, chief adviser of wildlife, at WWF-UK, said: “Pangolins are the most trafficked mammal in the world and this is having a devastating impact on populations across Africa and Asia.” \nThe pangolin banquet, which was reported to have taken place in July 2015, had “violated Chinese law”, said Keith Guo, regional spokesman for Peta (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals). \n“In China, some people still believe the meat of wildlife can improve health, and this has no scientific basis,” he added. \nComments on Sina Weibo, China’s version of Twitter, expressed outrage towards officials, who are often critisised for their extravagant lifestyles. \nBeijing ordered provincial authorities to investigate the alleged feast, news site thepaper.cn said. Local authorities did not respond to a request from The Telegraph for comment \n“So officials entertain themselves by eating endangered wildlife,” said one post. “No wonder I am concerned about the future of the country.” \nAdditional reporting by Christine Wei Follow Telegraph News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T19:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T14:28:19.300+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
