The 23-year-old was jailed for nine months, for leading a Patel community protest for reservations in government jobs and colleges. Patel, who was labelled an anti-national during the agitation, said that this kind of name-calling is the worst thing anyone can do. He added, that because of his experiences, he now fears nothing. He added that after being jailed and called an anti-national, he has come out stronger and more determined about his views. “I have my age with me and the public with me. Whatelse can I want,” he told Navbharat Times.\nHe said that Narendra Modi and his government is afraid of him. He has nothing to hide from Modi or his aide Amit Shah . Patel says that it is untrue that he is against reservation of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes. He believes that reservation for a country like India is important for its development.\nWhen asked as to why does he want reservations for community which is rather well-to-do, he said that this is a misconception about the Patel community. “Go to Gadiyadhar or Amreli and see. Just because some five Patels are rich that does not mean that it is a well-to-do community,” said Patel. “ BJP claims that it is here to represent people. My family worked very hard for BJP to win in the elections. But BJP has forgotten the hard work we have done,” Patel said.\nYou May Also Like To Watch:\nPatel also commented on the Budget asking that who is this budget really for? If Arun Jaitley is saying that the budget is a people’s budget, then why is it in a language that 97 per cent of the population does not understand, he said. He said that BJP has won only because Congress was unsuccessful in winning over the youth. “Now BJP is trying to gain profit in the name of education,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T03:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T18:13:47.610+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
