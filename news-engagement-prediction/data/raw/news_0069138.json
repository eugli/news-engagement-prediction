The Smokin’ Aces and The Grey writer/director is hard at work on a whole lot of high-profile projects right now. He’s readying Bad Boys 3 to direct, he’s working on his recently announced The Raid remake with Frank Grillo , and he’s scripting Shawn Levy ‘s Uncharted movie . Now, we can add another big one to the pile. We’ve learned that Carnahan is currently writing the script for 20th Century Fox’s X-Force movie which is based on the comic by Rob Liefeld . \nIf you’re unfamiliar with X-Force , the Marvel comic series follows a team of mutants, a bit more militaristic and rougher around the edges than the X-Men , who take on the less savory wet works and black ops jobs. Like the X-Men , X-Force has featured a revolving team of heroes over the decades, but two of the most prominent figures are Cable and Domino, both of whom are set to appear first in Deadpool 2 . Image via Open Road Films \nAfter the unforeseen catch-fire success of Deadpool , and if the early reviews for Logan are any indication, Fox is on a hot streak with their R-rated superhero fare and Carnahan’s tone is a natural match for that grittier spin on the pop genre. His resume is full of action-oriented films that run the gamut from blisteringly bleak ( The Grey ) to high-octane absurdity ( Smokin’ Aces ). Speaking of which, Aces gives Carnahan an in with Ryan Reynolds who has proven a formative figure in the new direction of the X-franchise after doggedly shepherding Deadpool to the screen. \nAs of now, Carnahan is only writing the script for X-Force and is not currently attached to direct, but should Fox be a fan of the script (and if one of his clones has time in their schedule), he certainly has the experience to back a directorial gig. \nIn addition to X-Force and Deadpool 2 , the studio is also developing Josh Boone ‘s ( The Fault in Our Stars ) New Mutants , which is reportedly a YA-spin on the mutant-verse, and the mysterious X-Men 7 . Details are being kept tightly under wraps on the Apocalypse follow-up, but we recently learned that long-time X-Men writer and producer Simon Kinberg is looking to make his directorial debut with the project, which is supposedly titled X-Men: Supernova - and would focus on the Jean Grey/Dark Phoenix storyline. Sophie Turner recently revealed she’s “about to start shooting the next X-Men movie,” so more resolute details are likely just around the corner. \nLet us know what you think about Carnahan writing X-Force in the comments below.
