YouTube \nEman Ahmed, who weighs 500kg, was flown to India for lifesaving treatment. \nThe hospital specially converted a ground-floor accounts office into a 1000sqft facility to house Ahmed, who was accompanied on the journey by two doctors. \nShe will undergo a series of stringent medical tests before she can be cleared for surgery. GETTY IMAGES \nA special crane was used by the hospital to carry her bed inside a room catered to her treatment needs. \nAhmed was born weighing 5kg and diagnosed with elephantiasis, a condition in which body parts swell due to a parasitic infection, a medical website reported. \nThyroid problems forced her to stop going to school as a child, the Hindustan Times reported. In 2014, when she tipped the scales at 300kg, Ahmed suffered a stroke which left her paralysed, affected her speech and left her bedridden. \nAhmed will be operated on by veteran bariatric specialist Muffazal Lakdawala, who agreed to help the family pro bono after her desperate sister reached out to him.

Ad Feedback \nLakdawala said when he first saw Ahmed's picture, he was shocked she managed to be alive despite her host of grave medical problems. \n\"At the age of 11, Eman had gained immense weight because of which she could not stand up on her own, and would crawl on the knees,\" Lakdawala told My Medical Mantra last year.
