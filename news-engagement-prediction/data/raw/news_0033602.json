His uncle Kim Jong Un formally took power the following year. \nAsked why his uncle was appointed as leader, the then 17-year-old replied: \"My dad was definitely not really interested in politics. I really don't know how he (Kim Jong Un) became a dictator ... It was between him and my grandfather.\" \nKim Jong Nam, 45, died after he was allegedly killed by two women believed to be North Korean agents at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Monday. \nCommenting on the case, Dr Jae H. Ku, director of the US-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies told New York Times: \"Maybe Kim Jong Nam was about to do something drastic that would either compromise the regime or the family. By the nature of things in North Korea, the fact that he is in the bloodline represented a threat.\" \nThe young Kim said during the 2012 interview he wasn't aware of his family's status in North Korea until he was much older. \n\"I really didn't know until later on that my grandfather was a leader in Korea... Little by little, through conversations my parents had, I started to put the puzzle pieces together and then I realised who he was.\" \nAccording to South Korea's spy agency, Kim Jong Nam's family members enjoyed Beijing's protection. Kim Han Sol is the son of Kim Jong Nam's second wife Lee Hye Kyong. His family lived in virtual exile in the Chinese territory of Macau, while his father's first wife and son lived in Beijing. \nKim Han Sol described an isolated childhood where the family had to keep a very low profile. \"All my friends are from outside, like Macau,\" he said in the interview. \nIn 2011, the United World College (UWC) Mostar extended a scholarship to Kim Han Sol after Hong Kong refused him a visa to study there. The school is one of 17 UWC schools worldwide that aim to bring together students from conflict zones with the goal of healing ethnic divisions after the Bosnian war of the 1990s. \nKim Han Sol said he enjoyed his friendships with Americans and South Koreans while at school, despite the tensions between his country and theirs. \nWhile it was awkward when he first met his South Korean friends, \"little by little we started to understand each other ... and sometimes we share stories from back home and realise how similar we are: the same language, the same culture - it really is just political issues that divide the nation in half,\" he said in comments reported by The Guardian newspaper. \nHe also revealed he has a Libyan roommate who would share stories of the 2011 revolution in Libya which overthrew the four-decade rule of dictator Muammar Gaddafi. \nKim Han Sol, according to media reports, is now studying at France's prestigious Sciences-Po university. The IEP de Paris that he is joining is part of France's Grandes ecoles (higher education research institute) system, which exists outside of the regular university framework. \nThe grand ecoles institutions are reputedly strong in political studies and have turned out many well-known French politicians and diplomats, including French president Francois Hollande. \nA school official told South Korean newspaper Hankyoreh: \"Kim has a deep interest in international affairs and humanitarian activities.\" - The Straits Times/Asia News Network", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T15:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T10:53:48.629+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
