Only a few are old enough to remember the 1970s, when street art and graffiti exploded in New York City. Since then street art, in particular, has moved away from its renegade roots. Now it claims mainstream respectability; galleries represent the artists and exhibitions put their work before the public.

The idea for doing street art on the 69th floor started when Dara McQuillan , the chief marketing officer for Silverstein Properties, took some photographs to a nearby framing shop, the World Trade Gallery , which doubles as an exhibition space. Mr. McQuillan was intrigued by what he saw and struck up a conversation with the owner, Doug Smith. “He said, ‘I’m curating these artists and I thought I’d offer them a space, but it’s small,’” Mr. McQuillan recalled. “I said, ‘Would they be interested in a bigger space?’ He came by and I took him up, and his eyes practically popped out of his head.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story A bigger space, in this case, meant wide. “A lot of artists are accustomed to 30 inches, 40 inches,” Mr. Smith said. “Street artists, they can do 30 feet.” Ron English’s “No Brain No Pain” is one inch wider than that. David Hollier’s “$10 Bill” is 23 feet 11 inches wide by 11 feet 8 inches high. The floor’s south side evolved into a text side, with “$10 Bill” on a wall there. (It faces the graveyard at Trinity Church, Mr. Smith noted, where Alexander Hamilton is buried .) The east side of the floor became “more fine art,” Mr. Marcucci said, while the west side was “more of a graphic side, something akin to a graphic novel — fantasy, comic.” One work — “In Bloom,” by David Uda, who is known as Duda — is a tribute to Sept. 11, Mr. Marcucci said.

Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times For some artists, the 69th floor was a departure from their previous work spaces. Mr. English once wandered the streets with a bucket of glue, plastering paintings on billboards, and once he barely escaped an angry mob in Jersey City (which later gave him keys to the city). The 69th floor was quiet, and the artists had as much time as they wanted. Another artist on the 69th floor, Sean Sullivan, said his street name, Layer Cake, came from his fascination with the way street art was made — layered over what was there before. For one of the Trade Center works on which he collaborated, Mr. Smith used images of people who had come before: the face of his grandfather, who, he said, “beat federal indictments, like, for running numbers.” Not pictured is his father, who he says is a detective on the New York Police Department’s bomb squad. Angela China, known as Gumshoe, did three panels titled “Stripes and Stilettos.” Ms. China said she had wanted to do an image of a Campbell’s soup can with legs, similar to a mural she had created in Bushwick, Brooklyn. But she said it had not proved suitable for the 69th floor. “I heard through the grapevine, ‘Keep it very PG,’” she said. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.
