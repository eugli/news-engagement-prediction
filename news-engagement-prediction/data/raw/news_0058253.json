Bradley will testify (and likely be subject to vigorous cross-examination) that the defendant repeatedly told him that he felt that people -- and, ultimately the homicide victims in this case -- were 'trying' him.\" \nThe second Pouncey phone call took place on April 28, 2015: \n\"During this call, [Hernandez] stated words to the effect of, 'I’m going to get another tattoo that looks like a stop sign that will say, ‘Beware, no hesitation.’ [Hernandez] said, 'You feel me? Like try me and there’s no hesitation.'\" \n\"Again, as set forth above, this statement is relevant to the defendant’s use of the word 'try' and ongoing perception that others were 'trying him' -- and suggest how the defendant responds when tried.\" \nHernandez is accused of killing Daniel Jorge Correia de Abreu and Safiro Furtado as retaliation for someone in their group accidentally bumping into him at a nightclub. \nHernandez and Pouncey played college football together at the University of Florida and stayed friends for years.
