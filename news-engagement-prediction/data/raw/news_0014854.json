In any one week, up to 40 sex workers were marketing their services in properties for a few days before moving on. File photo The number of reports of suspected brothels in Swindon nearly doubled between 2014 and 2015, from 60 to 112. Det Sgt Hitchcock added that the force was currently monitoring a total of between 170 and 190 women involved in sex work ‘predominantly’ in Swindon. Devon and Cornwall Police revealed earlier this year that criminal gangs were using holiday lets in Newquay as brothels. Officers discovered 14 premises being used for paid sex since July last year and believed more were being operated. Owners had no idea their second homes or investment properties were being used for such activities, and they are often brought to the attention of the police when neighbours report unusual behaviour. Inspector Dave Meredith, of Newquay police, said at the time: ‘They move quickly, they book them online and they advertise their services via the internet. ‘Certainly you wouldn’t see anything in the local papers or women touting for business in the street. It’s all web-based.’ The Lake District was also revealed to be a target last year as human traffickers used hotels and guesthouses as pop-up brothels. The crime gangs trafficked refugees to use as sex workers, block-booking hotel rooms in Barrow and across the south lakes. Wiltshire Police have said that most of the prostitutes are eastern European and the brothels are understood to be linked to crime gangs. File photo of Swindon town centre One landlady in Barrow was shocked when she found prostitutes were using her property. She told the North-West Evening Mail last year that she trawled through her guest house’s CCTV saw images of local men regularly visiting prostitutes. A study last year by the Police Foundation found women in pop-up brothels were more likely to be trafficked than in standard brothels.
