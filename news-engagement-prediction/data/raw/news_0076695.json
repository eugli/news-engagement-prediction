The pictures you take now are so much better than they were ten or even five years ago, and you may not think you need to do any post processing, or out-of-camera photo editing, before you print or share your photos. But there are just a few, simple things you can do to make those good photos so much better. These actions don't require much time or technical knowledge, but can greatly enhance your pictures. Cull the Bad Shots Digital cameras allow us to take lots and lots of pictures, but that does not mean we have to keep them all. I confess--I used to keep every shot no matter how lousy it was. Thank goodness I got past that mental block! The first thing you should do after you take the pictures off your camera is to give them an initial review and mark the bad ones in some way. Most software includes a rating or tagging function to help you do this. Then just get rid of those bad pictures!\nThere may be one or two photos that are technically bad, but you see some potential there for a special effect or art treatment . \ncontinue reading below our video Photoshop Tutorial: How to Straighten a Crooked Photo Go ahead and flag those in some way and keep them for later experimentation. And if you just can't bring yourself to delete the bad shots completely, mark them hidden, or mark them for later review, but please don't show the world every single shot you took from a particular event.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T18:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T07:12:48.521+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
