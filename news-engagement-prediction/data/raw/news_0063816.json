(AAP) \nPauline Hanson has ousted two One Nation Western Australian election candidates from her party, just weeks out from poll day. \nNorth West Central candidate Dane Sorensen and Thornlie candidate Sandy Baraiolo have been dis-endorsed after criticising the party's preference swap deal with the Liberal Party. \nOne Nation WA leader Colin Tincknell said Senator Hanson had made it clear to candidates that they were not allowed to run their campaigns independently. \n\"We unfortunately had to disendorse both of these candidates as they did not meet the standards that are required to be a Pauline Hanson One Nation candidate,\" he said. \n\"We wish them all the best as independents.\" \nMeanwhile, Premier Colin Barnett announced a $6 million boost to an in-home hospital service program. \nThe program is freeing up hospital beds and allowing suitable patients to be treated in the comfort of their own home by visiting medical staff. \nThe funding boost equates to an extra 15 people per day being treated at home. \nAn independent study found that more than 95 per cent of patients preferred treatment at home, Health Minister John Day said.
