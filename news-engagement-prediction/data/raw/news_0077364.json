(Photo: ITV) (Photo: ITV) \n“The pilot may have turned off oxygen in the cabin before landing and put on his own oxygen mask.” \nSpeaking to Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby, Mark explained this means we don’t know what happened to the pilot. \nHe added: “Did he commit suicide or survive? We don’t know!” \n*This Morning continues on ITV1 weekdays at 10.30am Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T19:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T14:17:23.446+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
