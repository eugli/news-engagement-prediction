The John Frieda Blonde Perfecting Treatment is here to help you eschew that processed, chemically altered, flat, dull, meh look. (Should we go on?) The scientists at John Frieda know the struggle is real and have come up with a number of innovations from violet-hued shampoos like to base-lifting treatments like John Frieda Sheer Blonde Go Blonder Lightening Shampoo to prevent blonde burnout. But their latest launch might just be the most revolutionary yet. What’s cool about it: The company teamed up with a major film manufacturer—like rolls of film, not Hollywood studio—to study why blonde colors light up so well on screen—and how to capture that same Technicolor effect IRL. \"In the film industry, everything is so bright and vibrant,\" says Jill Lynch, a research leader at John Frieda. \"We wanted to understand how to bring this same brightness and color to the hair color market.\" The goal wasn’t to reach Marilyn’s platinum level; more like Brigitte Bardot’s sandy honey-gold. After two decades of research (seriously), they hit on a breakthrough discovery.

By placing a band of color particles around the inner perimeter of the cortex, you can create \"an intense light reflection,\" she goes on. \"Depending on the angle of the light, you’ll see varying tones of blonde, from pale to caramel, that blend together in a subtle and natural way.\" This proprietary light-reflecting technology, she says \"is like nothing else in the mass market today. It’s the first time we’ve seen this before.\" All of this innovation is bottled in the John Frieda Blonde Perfecting Treatment [https://www.johnfrieda.com/en-US/ProductDetail/Hair-Care/Sheer-Blonde/Brilliantly-Brighter-Blonde-Perfecting-Treatment], the star product of John Frieda’s new Sheer Blonde Brilliantly Brighter collection, which is just hitting drugstores now, and also includes the Ultra Illuminating Shampoo [https://www.johnfrieda.com/en-US/ProductDetail/Hair-Care/Sheer-Blonde/Brilliantly-Brighter-Ultra-Illuminating-Shampoo] and Conditioner [https://www.johnfrieda.com/en-US/ProductDetail/Hair-Care/Sheer-Blonde/Brilliantly-Brighter-Ultra-Illuminating-Conditioner] (all nicely priced at $9.99). The treatment works a lot like a leave-in mask that you apply to damp hair in the shower. Just rub it all over, fully coating the underside and top layers of your strands. Then let it sit for five minutes so those particles can sink into the hair shaft and cluster around the inner wall of the cortex. Then rinse as usual. While you might be tempted to leave the treatment on longer, doing so won’t give you a more saturated halo of light, says Lynch. \"Instead, you’ll get too much definition so your color becomes too uniform, without those highs and lows,\" she says. One treatment should last a week, or three to five washes. Interestingly, you can start using this fix immediately after a coloring session (at home or the salon) and it works equally well on natural, born-with-it-blondes. Good news also if you blowdry and heat style—neither will diminish the results, says Lynch.
