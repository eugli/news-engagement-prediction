For the Falcons, it’s only the second trip to the Super Bowl in franchise history and a chance to win a ring for the first time. The only other trip came 18 years ago in Super Bowl XXXIII, but Atlanta came out on the losing end against the Denver Broncos , 34-19. While the Falcons were a well-rounded team in 1998, this time they will look to ride a prolific offense that scored the most points in the NFL in the regular season and kept it going in the postseason with 80 points in two wins. That offense is led by the deadly combination of NFL MVP quarterback Matt Ryan and All-Pro wide receiver Julio Jones. But the defense finished No. 27 in the NFL in points allowed, even if it played significantly better in the final month of the season. New England enters much more well-rounded, statistically. Three-time Super Bowl MVP Tom Brady leads the No. 3 scoring offense in the NFL, and no team allowed fewer points in the regular season than the Patriots. Sunday will be the seventh Super Bowl for the duo of Brady and Bill Belichick, record amounts for any coach or quarterback. Don Shula coached in six Super Bowls during his Hall of Fame career, and Brady already surpassed John Elway’s record of five Super Bowl appearances when the Patriots won Super Bowl XLIX two years ago. In addition to the game Sunday, there’s plenty of pageantry that will come with the big stage at NRG Stadium in Houston. Lady Gaga will perform during halftime and Luke Bryan will sing the national anthem before the kickoff scheduled for 6:30 p.m. ET.
