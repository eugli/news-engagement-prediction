If you haven’t, stop what you are doing and go fix that situation immediately. We’ll wait. If you have, then congratulations and welcome to the club for those of us who are getting obsessed with the fun, froth, excitement, and all those good-looking houses . (Be sure to check out Nicole Sperling’s recap here and our take on who was murdered here .) \nIt’s not often you have talent such as Nicole Kidman, Reese Witherspoon, Shailene Woodley, Laura Dern, Zoë Kravitz, Alexander Skarsgård, and Adam Scott all in the same TV show, to say nothing of David E. Kelley in charge of the scripts and Oscar-nominated Jean-Marc Vallée behind the camera as director. But when you have a story like this one — three mothers who have young children in the same class in a privileged school in Monterey, California, and are drawn together after a minor playground incident escalates, and as the drama compounds, the explosive secrets each woman is keeping lead to a member of their clan ending up dead — it starts to make a lot more sense. \nWhen Shailene Woodley stopped by Women on Pop at EW Radio on SiriusXM (channel 105), she teased a bit about where Jane’s relationships with Madeline (Witherspoon) and Celeste (Kidman) are headed. \n“Through the process of their relationships, she’s really able to be vulnerable and admit that those judgments were simply the kind of projections for a story that we tell ourselves in which we think that we must live a certain way in order to achieve a certain thing. Or be a certain thing,” she said. \nFor those of you who read the book, you probably noticed Jane’s more badass attitude in the series. Woodley offered a bit of an explanation for that difference: “I read the first few chapters of the book and then I noticed that Jane was written differently in the book than she was in the script,” she admitted. “I don’t know if I made her more badass or if it was sort of a mix of David E. Kelley’s, who’s a fantastic writer, adaption from the book to screenplay in addition to Jean-Marc Vallée’s sort of — he wanted her to be a little bit more punchy.” \nHear more from Woodley in the interview below: \nBig Little Lies airs Sundays at 9 p.m. on HBO.
