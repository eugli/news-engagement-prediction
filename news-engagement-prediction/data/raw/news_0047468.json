With her children at her side, Alma declared: ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) succeeded in separating us, but they will never succeed in dividing us. Alma bravely declared that our fight to stop her husband’s deportation is only just the beginning of a broader fight for immigrant rights in Pittsburgh. \nAs leaders in the labor movement, we recognize that the struggle of American immigrants like Martín is deeply intertwined with the struggle for working families. Martín Esquivel Hernández came to America in pursuit of a family-sustaining job that could provide stability and security for his family. We spent months in the streets fighting to stop Martín’s deportation because it is our life’s work to ensure that all workers are given the basic rights they deserve. All workers deserve a living wage, a voice at work, and the right to live without fear, regardless of their immigration status. \nWe stand with the Esquivel family, and with all immigrant families who seek sanctuary and the prospect of a better life in the United States for themselves and their families. Martin’s deportation did not occur in a vacuum — days later, unprecedented ICE raids rounded up four immigrants in Pittsburgh and nearly 700 immigrants across the country. The Trump administration is actively sowing anti-immigrant hatred and creating terror in our immigrant communities. They feel the tangible fear of more raids and the gaping holes left behind when families are torn apart. Our places of work, our neighborhoods, our schools and universities feel the loss of civic leadership, community engagement, talent, and innovation when we turn our backs on immigrants and their contributions. Our economy suffers the loss of tax revenue, productivity, and entrepreneurship. Our country, our cities, and our communities cannot endure a loss of this magnitude; we cannot afford to go backwards. \nWe will continue to fight for the rights of all workers, no matter where they were born, and we call upon our elected officials to do everything in their power to stop ICE and the Trump administration from breaking up more families. As Martín’s supporters chanted in unison on Feb. 7: “ ni una más deportación .” The time is now for all of us to stand with immigrant communities and demand: not one more deportation. \nSam Williamson is Western Pennsylvania District Director, 32BJ SEIU.
