There should be no further burden on victims to chase a letter to verify their claim. The government needs to scrap this fee by bringing the service under NHS funding or – better still – scrap the need for the letter entirely.”\nFamily courts chief backs end to abusers cross-examining their victims Read more \nDue to recent changes to legislation, victims of domestic abuse now have to provide a piece of evidence – such as a GP’s letter – to prove the abuse before they can access legal aid.\nNot all GPs are charging for this letter, campaigners say, but some have required fees of up to £175 from victims who have endured rape, beatings or mental abuse by their partner.\nThe letter by police and crime commissioners also calls on Liz Truss, the justice secretary, to scrap the requirement for the letter altogether. \nThe letter says: “ Reports of domestic abuse are increasing across the country. Two women are killed every week in England and Wales by their partner or former partner. Escaping abusive relationships is a struggle; it takes a great deal of strength and courage, and the government must do all it can to avoid placing unnecessary barriers in front of people who are clearly desperate to change their circumstances.\n“It should not be a privilege for victims of domestic abuse to gain legal aid. There should be no further burden on victims to chase a letter to verify their claim.”\nTom Watson, the deputy Labour leader, first raised the controversial fee after visiting a women’s refuge in Wythenshawe, Manchester. He said: “People suffering domestic abuse are already incredibly vulnerable. We should be taking action to help them, not demanding payment for a letter they need to access justice.\n“Nearly half of women take no action as a result of not being able to apply for legal aid. That’s appalling. Help for victims of domestic violence should never come at a price. \n“I have requested an urgent meeting with ministers to put an end to this practice. The government should scrap this unfair, immoral fee now. It has to stop.”\nSarah Green, co-director of the End Violence Against Women campaign, described the intervention by PCCs as extremely welcome. \nShe said: “Without access to legal aid, some women are being denied access to justice and protection for themselves and their families. It is unreasonable to put a ‘certifying’ duty on doctors and many women would not in any case disclose domestic abuse to their GP.\n“This matter mirrors the unreasonable arrangements being put in place for rape survivors trying to access tax credits for children conceived as a result of rape – again they need a letter from a doctor or other officialdom. These rules need wholesale revision.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T00:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T19:45:42.648+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
