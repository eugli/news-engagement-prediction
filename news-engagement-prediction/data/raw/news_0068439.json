PUBLISHED: 03:00, Sat, Feb 25, 2017 | UPDATED: 03:11, Sat, Feb 25, 2017 \nFishing for Leave has informed the Government that a number of current EU states will have “backdoor” access to part of Britain’s fishing waters under the London Conventions Act 1964.Under current Brussels law derived from the EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), members of the European superstate are allowed to fish between 12 and 200 miles away from British coastlines. GETTY Fishing for Leave are urging Theresa May to pull Britain out of the London Conventions Act 1964 Related articles 'British tourists may have to PAY to visit Europe after Brexit' \nHowever the London Conventions Act, which predates Britain’s entry into the EU, gives a gaggle of EU nations access into fishing waters between six and 12 nautical miles from British shores.Alan Hastings, from Fishing for Leave, said that because the deal was signed before Britain joined the EU, European states will still have access to the six mile ring around British coastlines as this legislation is not part of EU law which may be torn up when Article 50 is triggered.The pre-EU agreement will take two years to finally be denounced – meaning the legislation must be rescinded at the same time that Article 50 is triggered so there is no overlap, the group argue. GETTY Fishing For Leave have contacted the Government to seek assurances over closing the deal \nMr Hastings said: “European nations access rights between 12 and 200 miles were entirely gained under the CFP, but they will still have this old historic agreement between six and 12.“Once you give them access they can jump up and down, the can say you have allowed us to be here, we still want our shares under the law. It leaves them a backdoor where they can sneak round the back and get in.“They will try their absolute hardest to throw them out, the French especially who have built up an big fleet to get in our waters.” Is this the world's SEXIEST angler?
