Andy Jackson \nMurray Chong \nChong claimed he had seen figures showing $600 million was spent annually which equated to $33,333 for each of the 18,000 proficient Maori speakers in the country. \nREAD MORE \nWhile the second-term councillor's initial post was only viewable to his 1351 friends on Facebook, one of them, Dinnie Moeahu, felt as an elected representative Chong should be answerable to the entire community and made it public. MORNING REPORT/RNZ \nA New Plymouth councillor is at the centre of a backlash over a Facebook post in which he says te reo Maori is \"being kept alive on a respirator\". The former mayor of New Plymouth Andrew Judd says his comments are a result of a lack of real understanding about our past and a consequence of our ignorance. \nMoeahu said he felt angry, insulted and believed the post had crossed the line when he saw it. \n\"Definitely, not just to me and not just to Maori his ignorance on the issue is insulting to people in general,\" Moeahu said. \n\"For me, I've had enough of his one-sided ignorant opinions and I decided to take a stand. SIMON O'CONNOR/Fairfax NZ \nDinnie Moeahu challenged Chong to a debate on Maori issues. \n\"I felt that he definitely stepped over the line, I spoke for plenty of people both Maori and non-Maori.\" \nThe online response has been overwhelmingly negative, with some posts calling Chong a racist. \nChong, who said it was his personal view and not a council matter, wouldn't talk further about the post saying he'd let his comments on social media speak for themselves. \n\"I say things how they are and also how 80% of others see it, and that is why I moved further up the voter list in last years councillor elections than any of the other standing councillors, and if I was wrong then I would have gone down on this list. \n\"We can't just keep pouring hundreds of millions of dollars every year into something to improve it when the facts are that nationally it is going backwards.\" \nHe advised people they didn't like his views on this type of issue to simply not read his posts. \nMoeahu said te reo was not a dead language and Chong had never visited a kura kaupapa, whananga or any other Maori institution to see that for himself. \nTeaching te reo in New Zealand schools should be embraced not seen as a negative, he said. \n\"By learning an indigenous people's language you gain understanding of that people and how their way of life is and when you understand them you have a better appreciation of that culture. \n\"I would love to see our country of Aotearoa, have the same passion when they speak te reo as when they do the haka, the same passion when they speak te reo as when they watch the All Blacks play,\" Moeahu said. \nOn Facebook Moeahu challenged Chong to a debate on Maori issues. \n\"Seize the moment Murray and show me what you know when it comes to anything to do with Te Ao MƒÅori!!,\" he said. \nMoeahu said Chong's views put wedges between people and he had had enough. \n\"You're suppose to be in a leadership role to help bring our community together, to celebrate our individuality, diversity and uniqueness. \n\"Work on the mutual struggles together as a community, build each other up, work on the challenges we face to ensure as a whole community we're more inclusive, inspiring positive futures for all our rangatahi.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T04:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:12:27.452+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
