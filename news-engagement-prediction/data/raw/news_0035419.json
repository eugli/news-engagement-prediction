Feb, 18 2017 08:48:06 IST \nWill the AIADMK survive the next four years and stay in power? \n\nPanneerselvam camp demands secret ballot to decide on confidence motion \n\nDon't smile at me: Stalin's advice to Palaniswami \n\nDMK's Working President M.K. Stalin on Friday advised newly-sworn-in Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palanisamy against smiling at him in the assembly. \n\nThe strange advice came just a few days after AIADMK General Secretary V.K. Sasikala had noted that former Chief Minister O Panneerselvam had smiled at Stalin — and cited that as one of the reasons for asking him to step down. \n\nOPS vs EPS \n\n'Sasikala violated promise to Jayalalithaa' \n\nIn his statement, E Madusudhanan alleged that Sasikala \"violated\" her promise to Jayalalithaa that she will not enter politics and that she had no inclination to be a part of the party or government. \n\n\"VK Sasikala is being removed from the party's primary membership for going against the party principles and ideals, and having violated her promise to Amma (Jayalalithaa), besides facing criminal cases. She has brought disrepute to the party,\" he said in a statement. \n\nAIADMK MLA M Natarajan to vote against Palaniswami in floor test \n\n'Sasikala's cunning strategy pays off, she rules from jail' \n\nWhere did OPS go wrong? \n\nStory over for OPS: But he could be a strong anti-AIADMK voice in Tamil Nadu \n\nWith Palaniswami in driver's seat, how will BJP-led Centre deal with new Tamil Nadu government \n\nWith Palaniswami in the driver's seat and the remote firmly in Sasikala's hand, it would be interesting to see how the new government deals with the BJP-led Centre. The Centre needs the government's support for getting its candidate elected as the next President of India. The AIADMK numbers are crucial also in the Rajya Sabha, where the government is currently outnumbered by the Opposition. \nIf Sasikala decides to avenge her humiliation by the Centre and decides to join the anti-BJP camp, it would turn out to be a lose-lose situation for everybody who supported Panneerselvam and thwarted Chinnamma's dream. \nDenouement seems rational and justified \n\nThough Panneerselvam has been expelled from the party, he will continue to remain under the control of the party. In 2016, the government had clarified in the Supreme Court that upon expulsion from a political party, there is no automatic disqualification under the 10th Schedule of the Constitution from legislative assembly or Parliament and that member will continue as an unattached member as per the direction of the Speaker. \n\n\"However, if there is any overt act of either joining any other political party voluntarily or defies any whip of any political party then he will attract the provision of the 10th Schedule and action can be taken against him by the Speaker,\" the government clarified. \nThis means if Panneerselvam and his supporters violate the AIADMK whip to support Palaniswami's government in case of a floor test, they could be expelled from the Assembly. So, if Panneerselvam wishes to remain a member of the legislature, he would have to obey the diktat of the new high command. \nEnd of OPS: With Sasikala proxy nominated as Tamil Nadu CM, OPS' future may end into oblivion \n\nUnless a miracle saves him or his supporters spill out on the streets, this looks like the end of O Panneerselvam — the courtier who wanted to be the king. On Thursday, Tamil Nadu Governor C Vidyasagar Rao ended the stalemate and power games in the state by inviting E Palaniswami to form the government. He has been given 15 days to prove his majority in the Assembly. \n\nWith the governor's decision to invite Palanisamy — a proxy nominated by VK Sasikala's camp after Chinnamma's incarceration — to form the next government, the acting chief minister faces a dark future that may end into oblivion. \n\nThe governor's decision ensures that either Panneerselvam goes out and breaks the AIADMK with the support of at least two-third legislators or loses his Assembly seat. His third option is, of course, to go back to the AIADMK and become its loyal servant again, provided the powers that control the party forgive and forget. \n\n- The full bench of Election Commission of India will conduct enquiry today at 2.45 pm on the validity of appointment of VK Sasikala as General Secretary of AIADMK based on the complaint of Sasikala Pushpa RS MP and Mathusoothanan. This outcome will decide the validity of Sasikala's actions as general secretary. \n- Sasikala Pushpa had told the Commission that the elevation of Sasikala as the general secretary of the party was carried out in an \"undemocratic manner\". \nIt's all over for Panneerselvam \n\nAfter Governor C Vidyasagar Rao formally invited Edappadi Palaniswami to form the government in Tamil Nadu — effectively making him the new chief minister of the state — supporters of O Panneerselvam, who heads the losing faction of AIADMK, said that it's not over yet. ANI tweeted that V Maitreyan from OPS camp is going to meet the Election Commission in Delhi this afternoon. \n\nBut it is over for OPS. The only way OPS comes out on top after this debacle id if the defected leader is able to prove a two-thirds majority on the floor of the House in a floor test 15 days later. If he fails and abstains from appearing in Assembly after the dealine is over, OPS and supporting MLAs will be disqualified under the anti-defection law. \n\n\"The Tenth Schedule — popularly known as the Anti-Defection Act — was included in the Constitution in 1985 by the Rajiv Gandhi ministry and sets the provisions for disqualification of elected members on the grounds of defection to another political party.\" \n\nEdappadi Palanisamy is the new chief minister of Tamil Nadu \n​ \nPanneerselvam camp plays down Palanisamy-Governor meet \n\nSpeaking to News18 , BJP leader Subramanian Swamy said, \"First Sasikala, and now Palanisami have produced the list. Panneerselvam has not been able to produce a list even now. It has become a national disgrace that Vidyasagar Rao took so much time to do what should have been done earlier. His friends played on his emotions. I have no doubt about his integrity, but he is a bit sentimental about friendships. The Centre said they wouldn’t take an official stand. It is between the governor and the President, and the Constitution.\" \nPalanisamy leaves Golden Bay resort, heads to Raj Bhavan \n\nPolitical impasse in Tamil Nadu might end by Friday \n\nOn Wednesday evening, AIADMK's leader of the legislature party Palanisamy and Panneerselvam met Rao separately. After the meeting AIADMK Presidium Chairman KA Sengottaiyan expressed confidence that the Governor would soon invite Palanisamy to form the government. Fisheries Minister D Jayakumar too echoed similar views post Rao's meeting. \n\nGovernor Vidyasagar Rao will announce his decision today \n\nTamil Nadu Governor C Vidyasagar Rao has assured supporters of Sasikala that he will announce his decision today (Thursday). \"If Governor invites us, swearing in can happen today itself,\" Sasikala camp sources were quoted as saying by News18. In fact, the channel confirmed that the governor will meet Palanisami at 11.30 today morning. \n\nSasikala and Ilavarasi would share a small cell in women's block \n\nSasikala will be in jail for three years and about 11 months out of the four years sentence awarded by the trial court, DG (Prisons) Sathyanarayana Rao told PTI. She had earlier spent 21 days in Parappana Agrahara jail after conviction by the trial court in September 2014. \n\nSasikala spent 21 days in the same prison in 2014 \n\nIn 2014, Sasikala, with her nephew V N Sudhakaran and sister-in-law Ilavarasi, had spent 21 days in Parappana Agrahara central jail. Sudhakaran and Ilavarasi are the co-convicts in the disproportionate assets case. At the time, the jail played host to J Jayalalithaa too, who was serving a term at the same place after being sentenced to four years by a special court that tried all four of them. \n\nParappana Agrahara central jail is the largest in Karnataka \n\nQaidi number 9235, Sasikala to make candles in prison \n\nFormer AIADMK General Secretary Sasikala, convicted in the disproportionate assets case by the Supreme Court, on Wednesday returned to the Bengaluru jail as the battle for supremacy in the AIADMK continued in Tamil Nadu. Sasikala, 59, was sent to a women's cell in the Central Jail soon after she reached Bengaluru in a convoy from Chennai after her plea for more time to surrender was rejected by the Supreme Court. \n\nIs 124 greater than 10? Answer to this will determine Tamil Nadu's future \n\nIs 124 greater than 10 or is it the other way round? All of Wednesday night, Governor Vidyasagar Rao sought the answer to this question in the land of Ramanujam. On it hinges how soon Tamil Nadu will get its new government. \n\nEdapadi Palanisamy has conveyed to Rao that he has the support of 124 MLAs, which is seven above the half way mark of 117. O Panneerselvam has not presented any numbers but it is obvious he has only ten legislators on his side. The fact that Raj Bhavan is still engaging with Panneerselvam is proof that a political farce is being played out in Chennai. \n\nSources say Rao himself is keen to put an end to this stalemate that has lasted ten days now. Personally he is in favour of inviting Palanisamy to form the government and ask him to prove his majority on the floor of the House within 24 to 48 hours. But the pitch has been queered by Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi who has suggested a composite floor test to be conducted between Panneerselvam and Palanisamy even though it is only the Supreme court that can order it. The governor reportedly is not convinced that the situation in Chennai warrants a composite floor test. \n\nWar of proxies: It's Jaya's versus Sasikala's \n\nAs Sasikala settled in at Bengaluru's Parappana Agrahara central jail day after the Supreme Court convicted her in a corruption case, her loyalist Edappadi Palaniswami called on Governor Vidayasagar Rao for the second time. His challenger to the post of the chief minister, O Panneerselvam, followed soon after. Speaking to CNN-News18 , sources said that the governor, who has been conspicuous by his silence so far, may call for a floor test on Friday. It was not immediately clear whether the floor test would be a composite one, as advised by Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi. \nOn a lighter note... \n\nAmidst drama, Sasikala provides more drama \n\nNo more chicken curry and booze for the reclusive freeloaders \n\nRemember Jayalalithaa’s final journey before the burial on 6 December, 2016? Remember those no-locus freeloaders who climbed on the army vehicle which held Jayalalithaa’s body? You’ll see them again today, stepping out of a house that’s not theirs and into a crowd that doesn’t want them here. \n\nJ Ilavarasi, Sudhakaran, Sasikala will bid goodbye to Veda Nilayam for a longish spell and we are sure to hear soon how they need urgent medical care for their fragile bodies not used to the rigours of a hard life in jail, minus chicken curry and booze. By the time they return to Chennai, Tamil Nadu will be bracing for another Assembly election and the cops outside Jayalalithaa’s home will be there not to welcome them but to shoo them away. \n\nSasikala likely to surrender before Bengaluru court today evening \n\nSasikala wanted some time to manage her affairs: Advocate \n\nThe Supreme Court said: \"We do not intend to pass any order on this. We are not going to change anything in the judgement.\" \n\nKey highlights from Day 8: Sasikala convicted, Panneerselvam expelled, Palanisamy new AIADMK leader \n\nIn her first address to party members and supporters since Supreme Court convicted her in the 20-year-old disproportionate assets case, Sasikala broke down and vowed that no one will be able to separate her from AIADMK. \n\nSasikala and co moved to Poes Garden to hold Jayalalithaa's assets: SC verdict \n\nA week ago, Tamil Nadu watched with astonishment the transformation of the soft-spoken O Panneerselvam into a rebel who could stand Sasikala’s meddling no more. Where did he get his confidence from when he did not even have the numbers? Even today, he has 11 or 12 MLAs with him. Did he know something about how the case verdict may turn out? \n\nEven when MLAs hastened slowly, even though his MP crossovers were more and they don’t really matter in the local Assembly, even when Sasikala kept threatening him and calling his a \"zero\" mocking the \"O\" in OPS, he stayed smiling and relaxed, although tired. After the Sasikala verdict, all that poise makes total sense. \n\nNow, with Sasikala trying the old “health reasons” trick to delay her trip to jail and a new player Edappadi Palanisamy turning up to claim the chief minister's post, OPS remains firm that he will win the floor test. It’s entirely likely that the OPS camp is banking on Governor Vidyasagar Rao to give them some time, now that the Supreme Court verdict has validated the governor’s waiting game in round one of the political drama in Tamil Nadu. The man on the street does not have a problem with that. \"They kept Amma in hospital for 75 days, they were in no hurry to tell us what’s going on. What’s the big hurry to swear in a new government? Let the governor take his time,\" they say. \n\nThe damning Supreme Court judgement against Sasikala and troupe certainly helps the OPS cause. Sample this from page 561 of the 570-page ruling (A1 is Jayalalithaa, A2 is Sasikala; A3 is Ilavarasi and A4 is Sudhakaran): \n\nWhat long drawn court cases have taught Sasikala? \n\nWhat’s the upside of a court case that goes on for 20 years? You can live almost half a life, for one. \n\nSasikala, because of her proximity to Jayalalithaa, is no stranger to Jaya’s doggedness. Her leaving Poes Garden last night, her being ready with the alibi of “health condition” and asking for four weeks time, the absurd sight of police guarding every inch of Golden Bay Resorts and Sasikala refusing to surface is the special education she’s gotten by just watching Jayalalithaa navigate two decades free as a bird after that outsize wedding in the September of 1995. As of this moment, Sasikala is still inside and the police outside Golden Bay Resorts. \n\nMuted reaction from the DMK \n\nOPS seeks time to prove majority \n\nPalanisamy meets Guv \n\nWho's Palanisamy? \n\nClearly there are two judgements because Justice Amitava Roy wanted to make a forceful extra point on corruption in the country. Those five pages have deepen the value of this judgement. \"The attendant facts and circumstances encountered as above, demonstrate a deep rooted conspiratorial design to amass vast assets without any compunction and hold the same through shell entities to cover up the sinister trail of such illicit acquisitions and deceive and delude the process of law. Novelty in the outrages and the magnitude of the nefarious gains as demonstrated by the revelations in the case are, to say the least, startling,\" Roy noted. \n\nIt took just eight minutes for the Supreme Court to announce its decision that abruptly cut short the political career of VK Sasikala, a long-time companion of former Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa, according to a report in NDTV . \"You can understand too much of fatty judgement. We have taken the burden on us...we will read out the conclusion,\" said Justice Pinaki Chandra Bose.\nTo this, the second judge, Amitava Roy, said, \"We are setting aside the high court judgement and restoring the trial court judgement in full. Case against A1 (Jayalalithaa) is abated. All convicted and surrender forthwith.\" Timeline of the infamous DA case starting from Subramanian Swamy's plea in 1995 \n\nFollowing is the chronology of events in the disproportionate assets (DA) case in which the Supreme Court on Tuesday convicted AIADMK General Secretary VK Sasikala that also involved the late chief minister J Jayalalithaa. \n1996: Subramanian Swamy, then Janata Party chief, files a case against Jayalalithaa alleging that during her tenure as Tamil Nadu Chief Minister from 1991 to 1996, she amassed properties worth Rs 66.65 crore disproportionate to her known sources of income. \n\n7 Dec 1996: Jayalalithaa arrested. Many allegations follow, including accumulation of disproportionate assets. \n\n1997: Prosecution launched in sessions court in Chennai against Jayalalithaa and three others for having assets 'disproportionate' to their known income. \n\n4 Jun 1997: They are charge-sheeted for offences under sections 120-B IPC, 13(2) read with 13(1)(e) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. \n\n1 October 1997: Madras High Court dismisses three petitions by Jayalalithaa including one challenging the sanction granted by then Governor M Fathima Beevi for prosecuting her. \n\nTrial progresses. By August 2000, 250 prosecution witnesses examined and only 10 more remained. \n\nIn the May 2001 Assembly elections, AIADMK secures absolute majority and Jayalalithaa becomes the chief minister. Her appointment is challenged due to her conviction in October, 2000 in the Tansi (Tamil Nadu Small Industries Corporation) case. The Supreme Court nullifies the appointment. READ THE FULL ARTICLE HERE O Panneerselvam: Jayalalithaa's 'Mr Faithful' rises again \n\nAfter filling in as the interim chief minister twice, O Panneerselvam is back at the helm of things. After the Supreme Court verdict which convicted VK Sasikala in the 20-year-old disproportionate assets case, OPS (even though expelled from AIADMK), is in a stronger position than his competition. \n\nFrom humble origins as a farmer and tea shop owner to Fort St George, the seat of power in Tamil Nadu, he has travelled a path of unexpected twists and turns. Jayalalithaa had sprung a surprise by handpicking him to fill her shoes in 2001 when she had to step down due to her conviction in TANSI land scam case. But this time, following her conviction, it was more or less clear he was leading the race among his colleagues, considering his unflinching loyalty to Jayalalithaa that even earned him the sobriquet 'Mr Faithful.' \n\nIncidentally, the politician had then chosen not to function from the chair on which his 'revered' leader sat while he performed the role of night watchman. He duly vacated the post after Jayalalithaa was acquitted in the case. \n\nE Palanisamy on his way to Raj Bhavan to stake claim to form government: 'I have sent a letter to Governor with details about MLAs' \n\nE Palanisamy has written a letter to Governor C Vidyasagar Rao and staked claim to form the government. AIADMK presidium chairman Sengottaiyan will also meet the Governor carrying MLAs support letter which says that the MLAs have unanimously elected Edapadi K Palanisamy as Legislative Leader of the party. \n\nVK Sasikala camp wrote a letter to the Governor mentioning that O Panneerselvan has been expelled and Edapadi K Palanisamy was appointed as the new leader of legislator. The letter further reads the Governor should invite them to form the government. \n\nAmma's golden rule will continue: O Panneerselvam \n\nHuge convoy of police deployed at Golden Bay Resort \n\nFive district SPs and IGs from two zones have been brought to the resort. SPs of Cuddalore, Kanchipuram, Thiruvallur, Villupuram and Vellore along with North and Central zone IGs are at the Golden Bay resort in Kovathur. From revenue department, only Seiyyur Tahsildar has arrived. No other government official has come here to the Golden Bay Resort. \nVidyasagar Rao stands vindicated for delaying AIADMK gen secy's swearing-in \n\nThe Supreme Court verdict convicting AIADMK general secretary VK Sasikala in a 19-year-old disproportionate assets case, effectively ending her chances of ever taking office as Tamil Nadu chief minister, is a vindication for Governor Vidyasagar Rao. \n\nThroughout the political turmoil, the governor had been targeted for his use of \"delaying tactics\". There were elaborate conspiracy theories drawn and endless sound bites given on why his office had taken the wait-and-watch approach. With the apex court indicating that it would deliver the verdict within a week, it made little sense for Rao to call Sasikala for swearing-in and usher in a Constitutional crisis should there be an unfavourable verdict (as it turned out to be the case). Considered legal opinion was of the view that he was right in not rushing into a hasty decision. No less than former Attorney-General of India Soli Sorabjee had come out in his favour. \n\nBut politics in India is a 24x7 reality show, driven by TV ratings. To the breathless media and its many pundits, the governor's \"delay\" was a sure sign that somebody was conducting a backroom operation from somewhere, dictating his actions. No evidence was offered for such a conjecture, but what's the point in waiting for facts when journalism can be conducted through speculation? \n\nFor all the heat being piled on him, governor Rao showed admirable patience in holding his counsel and not taking a decision that could trigger another crisis in the state later. READ THE FULL ARTICLE HERE \nDMK hails Sasikala verdict as historic \n\nSasikala always took Jaya's burden: AIADMK \n\nMinutes after the Supreme Court convicted VK Sasikala, the AIADMK on Tuesday threw its weight behind the party general secretary, saying she has always carried the \"burden\" of Jayalalithaa. \n\nSasikala now has few options left before her \n\nShe may make an application for review of the judgment. This application will have to be preferred within thirty days. There will be no oral arguments and a review will only be admitted if there is an error apparent on the face of the record. The chances of a review petition being admitted are slim. If that fails she can prefer a curative petition stating that natural justice was violated in her case. The chances of that being admitted are even more slim. \n\n\"Justice finally prevailed after 21 years. We welcome the verdict of the Supreme Court\": DMK's MK Stalin \n\nSupreme Court conviction doesn't debar Sasikala from running AIADMK \n\nSasikala's dreams of ruling Tamil Nadu ends before it began \n\nMerely a week ago, the drama in Tamil Nadu escalated without warning and there were two close confidantes of the late Jayalalithaa who were at each other for the Chief Minister's post. While O Panneerselvam went to Jaya's memorial and claimed \"Amma spoke\" to him, Sasikala said she was the one who stood by Amma for 33 years when the former chief minister was ridiculed by everyone. \n\nAIADMK still has majority, immediately nominate another person: Swamy \n\nSasikala has been convicted in the DA case \n\nTwo-judge bench convicts AIADMK General Secretary VK Sasikala in the 20-year-old corruption case. The embattled leader has been sentenced to 4 years in prison and has been told to surrender immediately. \n\nLess than 10 minutes left for verdict: Let's take a look at the possibilities \n\nAnother MLA joins OPS camp: Are Sasikala supporters nervous now? \n\nVerdict expected at 10.30 am \n\nON THE GROUND: Ten points on why Jayalalithaa trusted OPS \n\nWhat’s your address? Imagine you ask Sasikala that, what would she say? \n\nThe simplest questions are the most awkward to answer if you lock yourself into a web of secrecy and intrigue as Sasikala (just like Jayalalithaa) has done for the last two decades. \n\nJust for the record, this is where Sasikala can live without any question marks but she chooses not to — her address as in the DA case pending since 1996: #18, Third Cross Street, East Abhirampuram, Chennai - 600018. \n\nPoes Garden is the mansion Sasikala 'occupies' but it is Jayalalithaa’s property and we have no idea whether there’s a will. All we know is that a camp other than OPS’ flew in a top doctor from the UK in a tearing hurry last week to say that Jayalalithaa was “conscious” when she put her thumb impression on certain documents. What about Jayalalithaa’s will? Deafening silence. \n\nHas the change of police intelligence chief by O Panneerselvam prompted Sasikala to camp at the Golden Bay resort? \n\nSasikala’s dramatic move of shifting to the resort on Monday where about 119 MLAs are housed may not be a premeditated master-stroke, but a move necessitated by O Panneerselvam’s counter strategy to break her gridlock over the MLAs. \n\nOPS’ biggest weakness, since his break with Sasikala, has been the lack of police support and his inability to reach the MLAs to seek their endorsement. There had been reports that the police had provided tacit support to the Sasikala camp in guarding the resort and in ensuring that nobody from outside gained access. Reportedly there was ring of security provided by private men — OPS had that alleged there were four \"goondas\" per MLA — and the police also seemed to have supported them by preventing the media or others from entering the resort. \n\nA two judge bench is known as a Division Bench. If the judges of Division Bench disagree on a particular point of law, then they refer that particular point to a third judge for adjudication. The entire case will not go automatically to another bench. Unless however, they disagree on all issues of all, in which case a third judge will hear arguments on all the issues afresh and pass a separate verdict to resolve the division. \n\nHowever, divisions between judges in Division Bench have been growing rarer and rarer in recent years as most judgements are delivered either Per Curiam (in the name of the Court) and signed off by both judges or contain a leading opinion seconded by a shorter opinion. A dissenting opinion today will be quite rare. \n\nA case of dissenting view: Bachan Singh versus State Of Punjab on 9 May, 1980 \n\nThis is how Justice Bhagwati’s wrote: \n\nAnd this is how the final order, that referred to the minority view, read: \n\nEven OPS supporters are waiting for the verdict with bated breath \n\nHeavy security outside Poes Garden \n\nIf it's dissenting verdicts, what we are going to see today is a phenomenon that’s getting rarer \n\nSince both the names of the judges appear in the listing of the DA case, it’s expected that the judges are going to give separate judgments. If they dissent in their verdicts, the outcome for Sasikala and Tami Nadu politics can be be dramatically different. \n\nBut another important question is if it’s good for the development and practice of Law? According to this analysis by LiveLaw that looked at there verdicts from 1950 to 2014, the phenomenon of dissenting opinions by judges has declined since 2011 after steadily rising from 1980. The increasing number of two judge-benches and the heavy workload are cited as the possible reasons.\n\nStill, that the judges chose to write separate verdicts on the DA case, that has already taken 20 years and a lot of the courts’ time, shows that there’s something special about this case. Would it make some legal breakthrough? In case the verdicts are dissenting, the opportunity costs are going to be much higher because the hearing might start all over again which would entail more time of the SC judges, lawyers and even the final delivery of justice. \n\nThe LiveLaw study also has found out that in the benches of the Chief Justice of India (CJI), the rate of decline in dissent is more than in other benches. Between 2011 and 2014, there hadn’t been a single case of dissent. Could it be because the “persona” of the CJI or the indirect influence of his authority on a subordinate judge? One of the judges in the bench that heard the DA case is quite senior. \n\nSo, is it a good thing for the democracy and the judiciary? Looks like it is although it could further delay the already sluggish judicial processes. It’s indeed gladdening that we are going to witness today is something that’s getting rarer. Can we expect some new useful addition to our jurisprudence? Let’s wait and see. \nRs 3,50,000 spent for 119 MLAs at Golden Bay Resort \n\nIt is costing Rs 3,50,000 for 119 members of the Tamil Nadu legislative assembly \"living like a large, happy family\" in 56 rooms at Golden Bay Resorts in Koovathur, Tamil Nadu. That’s the room rent for a single day minus all the frills, service tax, Swachh Bharat cess and that sort of petty cash detailing. \n\n\"For tomorrow, we will surely have rooms available, Madam,\" says the sleep deprived front office manager at the suddenly famous beach resort on Chennai’s outer edge. \n\nJayalalithaa's nephew could be Sasikala's successor? \n\nA-list of legal minds who will always be associated with DA case \n\nAs we wait for the Supreme Court verdict, le's take a a look at the A-list of legal minds whose names will remain associated with the disproportionate case that has its roots in a gaudy million dollar wedding that pockmarked both Tamil Nadu and Jayalalithaa’s legacy and continues to haunt Sasikala. Everytime Jayalalithaa went in and out of courts for 19 years, these are the folks behind those headlines. \n\nJustice John Michael D’Cunha: Special Court judge who delivered the September 2014 verdict that sent Tamil Nadu into a tizzy - he convicted and jailed the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister under the Prevention of Corruption Act 1988 for holding disproportionate assets. In November 2016, he was appointed judge of the Karnataka High Court. \n\nBV Acharya - first special public prosecutor in the case. \n\nFali S Nariman: After Jayalalithaa was jailed, her team leaned on this eminent jurist to get bail for the AIADMK chief. \n\nJustice HL Dattu: Former Chief Justice of India Dattu heard Jayalalithaa’s petition in the Supreme Court against Karnataka High Court’s rejection of her bail plea in the DA case. \n\nJustices PC Ghose, Amitava Roy: Heard the appeal against the High Court Judgment delivered by Kumaraswamy J, and reserved the verdict June 2016 after 20 days of court arguments. \n\nSenior Advocate L Nageswara Rao: Appeared for Jayalalithaa as defence counsel in Supreme Court, argued that appeals by DMK and Subramaian Swamy had no locus. \n\nWhat is plan B for Sasikala if SC convicts her \n\nPlan B for Sasikala if she is convicted would mean to convene an emergency AIADMK legislature meeting and elect either E Palanisamy or Sengottaiyan as new leader of legislature party. \n\nIf DA case heads for split verdict, Tamil Nadu will have to wait longer to get a CM? \n\nGovernor C Vidyasagar Rao got back from Mumbai last Thursday and it was fairly clear that he would wait it out until the DA case verdict. \n\nHistory and precedent were all too familiar for the Governor to rush in last week — Jayalalithaa was disqualified as Chief Minister after she was convicted under the Prevention of Corruption Act in 2001 and again in September 2014. \n\nVoting process is still mysterious \n\nSources from the Koovathur Golden Bay Resorts, where all 124 supporting MLAs of Sasikala faction are accomodated told that, as many as 18 MLAs from the faction lined up against Palanisamy and that is why they were not brought to the swearing in ceremony of the cabinet. However, the party sources denied the claim and have ensured that they are strongly united and will continue their rule in the State. \nThe situation is almost like a cat on a wall as the voting process predictions are still mysterious even hours before the session. \nIf Palanisamy cabinet triumphs, then it is going to be a successful four year rule for the Sasikala faction. And OPS faction MLAs could be terminated from office as they don't stand alongside of the party's decision. \n\nOPS pleaded with AIADMK members on Friday \n\nPanneerselvam read out a statement at his residence making a passionate plea to AIADMK MLAs, saying that it was late Jayalalithaa's wish to end dynastic rule in Tamil Nadu. “If you are Amma’s true loyalists, you should vote against the (Palaniswamy) government when it seeks trust vote in the Assembly tomorrow,” he said. \nMy AIADMK vs your AIADMK \n\nSasikala kicked out OPS and OPS cancelled her out. So, who is theAIADMK party? Even EC is asking Sasikala to explain how she became General Secretary. \n\nMeanwhile, that there’s a horizontal split within the AIADMK is no secret either. This is not about OPS versus Sasikala, it’s the rank and file versus the MLAs, it’s the fight for the soul of the party which can’t be fixed over mutton biryani and booze at Golden Bay resorts. This is about starting at the beginning, going to the constituencies, winning back trust. \n\nOf the 123 MLAs who owe allegiance to Sasikala for either love or money, 31 are ministers, what about the rest? How will they be kept happy? What’s in it for them to watch their peers enjoy the perks of high office? One method is that the spoils of power instead of flowing upwards will be redistributed down the line to keep MLAs who are not ministers happy. \n\nThe other is that they are promised and /or given plum posts in Corporations and high visibility local bodies. \nElection 2017? \n\nWhat works best for the DMK? An election, of course. With Jayalalithaa dead, Karunanidhi alive, Sasikala in jail and her family clawing so desperately to run Tamil Nadu, public sentiment against status quo is at a peak never seen in the last half century. \n\nThe DMK (89-1) and its allies Congress (8) and IUML (1), have 98 members in all because DMK’s M Karunanidhi will not be attending the floor test. The Congress, despite some insiders softening towards Sasikala, would not want to upset its ally DMK. \n\nChief of TN Congress, S Thirunavukkarasar said “All our 8 MLAs will attend trust vote.” If both the AIADMK factions fail to win the trust vote, it’s election time, folks. \nNo secret ballot \n\nA floor test is not restricted to ruling party members — it’s for all present and voting, it’s not secret ballot. DMK will vote against the confidence motion moved by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palanisami, Congress has indicated likewise. Edappadi has 123 on his side. Mylapore MLA R Natraj who stayed in his constituency throughout the last 10 days while the crisis played out, said his vote is not for Palanisamy. \n\n“I'm feeling heavy inside. People and party cadre are extremely angry about the recent developments and I have to respect their feelings. So mine will be a conscience vote and not just a confidence vote tomorrow,\" Natraj told media Friday. \n\n\"This mandate was not won by Pannerselvam or Palanisamy, but late Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa. So what is the point in claiming their rights on it over and over again?”, he said. \nConfidence? None at all \n\nIt’s nerves in both factions of the AIADMK, far more in the one that’s jail-controlled. Palanisamy is just a footnote, all eyes are on crown prince TTV Dhinakaran. \n\nAbout 16-18 captive MLAs in the resort were not transported in luxury buses to Chennai at all — those more liable to jump ship who were not present at the swearing-in ceremony of the Cabinet. \n\nOn Saturday, expect violence, be surprised if it’s a peaceful weekend. Mannargudi’s mustachioed brotherhood is not to be taken lightly — smashing a few windowpanes, beer bottles, a bloody nose or two — welcome to JJ’s old fortress, now occupied by her minders, schemers and ticket distributors. \nTamil Nadu’s first trust vote in 30 years: Here are all the updated numbers \n\n233 - Trust vote is basis all present and voting. With M. Karunanidhi unwell and unlikely to attend and Jayalalithaa dead, the total strength for the trust vote is 233. \n\n124? - Palaniswami claims he has 124 but they’re not so sure anymore. R Nataraj, MLA from Mylapore constituency in Chennai and former DGP will be voting against Palaniswami. \n\n11- This is the number on OPS’ side for now, including former Chennai Police Commissioner R. Natraj. \n\nAIADMK whip S. Rajendiran issued a directive to all party MLAs to attend the Assembly and vote in favour of the motion. \n\n8 - Tamil Nadu Congress Committee has deferred till 9 a.m. today its decision. Will most likely toe DMK line. Congress has 8 members in the Tamil Nadu Assembly. \n\n89 - DMK leader Stalin, whose party has 89 in the House, decided they should not make it easy for Palaniswami by abstaining from the vote. \n\n1 - M Karunanidhi won’t surface today so that’s one less vote against AIADMK. \n\n18 - Word is that this is the number of MLAs not so thrilled about Palanisamy’s elevation to the State’s top job. Expect jealousy and infighting to surface, unless Sasikala’s family has arm twisted everyone into behaving. 08:20 (IST) \nE Palaniswami faces floor test on Saturday at 11 am \n\nUpdates from 18 February, 2017 begin 21:12 (IST) \nPanneerselvam asks MLAs to vote against the trust vote \nOn Friday evening, OPS asked MLAs to not buckle under the pressure and to safeguard Jayalalithaa's interests by voting against the trust vote.

He needs the support of 117 legislators to continue in the post. \nThe AIADMK party commands the support of 124 legislators, including the Speaker, while the breakaway group led by former Chief Minister Panneerselvam has 11 legislators. \nThe other opposition includes DMK with 89 members, Congress - eight, Indian Union Muslim League with one, and one seat is vacant. The DMK has said it will vote against the government, while the Congress has said it will wait for the party high command's directive. However, the Congress has indicated it will vote against the Palaniswami government. \nThe DMK (minus its President M. Karunanidhi who is unwell has 88 legislators to vote), Along with the Congress and Indian Union of Muslim League, the opposition group comes to 97. O Panneerselvam. PTI \nThe Panneerselvam camp has the support of 11, taking the tally against Palaniswami to 108. If there is some cross-voting to the tune of 10 legislators from Sasikala's camp then it could be the end for Palaniswami. \nThe Assembly has a total strength of 234 of which one seat is vacant. \nOn Friday, the Chief Minister's support base suffered erosion by one legislator. \nAIADMK legislator representing Mylapore constituency and former Director General of Police (DGP) R. Nataraj said he would vote against Palaniswami. \nFollowing Nataraj's about-turn at the last minute, Palaniswami's support base is down to 124 legislators. \nMeanwhile, a week after he was sacked from the AIADMK, former party Presidium Chairman E. Madhusudanan on Friday in turn \"dismissed\" General Secretary VK Sasikala, Chief Minister Palaniswami Deputy General Secretary TTV Dinakaran, Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha M.Thambidurai, A. Navaneethakrishnan, Thangamani, N.Dalavai Sundaram, Valarmathi, R.B. Udhayakumar, C.Ve. Shanmugam and S. Venkatesh — from the party's primary membership. \nThe vote of confidence is being held following a split in the AIADMK party after Panneerselvam revolted against General Secretary VK Sasikala charging her of forcing him to quit. \nSasikala is now in a jail in Bengaluru after being convicted in a corruption case. \nOn Thursday, Palaniswami was sworn in as Chief Minister and 30 ministers also took oath. \nMajority of legislators belonging to Sasikala camp are housed in a beach resort around 90 km from here and Panneerselvam hopes to get some votes from those legislators. \nAfter holding hectic discussions at Panneerselvam's residence on Friday morning, a small group of AIADMK leaders met the Speaker in the Secretariat and demanded secret ballot. \nSpeaking to reporters, S. Semmalai, part of the Panneerselvam camp, said they have urged the Speaker for a secret ballot to decide on the motion of confidence. \n\"Panneerselvam and the legislators supporting him should openly vote against the motion of confidence and to build on the credibility in the people's mind space,\" KC Palaniswamy, a former MP of AIADMK, told IANS on Friday. \nOn the other hand if secret ballot on the confidence motion is allowed and a whip is issued the issue before the Panneerselavam camp is whether to abide by the whip or disobey. \n\"In case if they disobey, whether they could be disqualified as legislators under the anti-defection law is a point to ponder,\" an AIADMK leader said. \n\"The party whip has to take orders from the leader before issuing any whip on the way in which legislators are to vote. In AIADMK's case the appointment of Sasikala as General Secretary is under dispute and also the appointments made by her. So that question would have to be decided before any legislator can be disqualified,\" Palaniswamy said. \nSasikala had recently dismissed Panneerselvam and former Minister K. Pandiarajan from the primary membership of the party and both are outside the purview of the anti-defection law. \nDMK General Secretary K. Anbazhagan has predicted the government will not survive. \nOn Thursday, MPs belonging to the Panneerselvam camp had met Election Commission officials and petitioned to disqualify Sasikala's appointment as General Secretary.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T09:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T05:24:36.132+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
