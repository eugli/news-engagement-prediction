While some teams went wholeheartedly for certain players (Ben Stokes was sold for a whopping Rs. 14 Cr to Pune), teams like Gujarat played easy, purchased 11 new players, and still had Rs. 10.5 Cr left in their purse! \nHere are the top five bargain buys that can prove to be worth every penny at the nominal rates that they have been bought for, a contrast to the big names that went for exorbitant rates: \nMartin Guptill - Rs. 50 Lakh (Kings XI Punjab) Guptill can be a real force to reckon with in the initial overs \nAn explosive opening batsman with proven credentials in limited-overs cricket, Guptill gets another opportunity to rectify his poor IPL record. Snapped up by Mumbai Indians as a replacement for the then-injured Lendl Simmons before the 2016 auctions, Guptill \nHe went unsold in the first round, and didn’t seem to be going for any bids when the Kings XI intervened and bought him for his base price of Rs. 50 lakh. \nThe right-hander, who has to name a double-hundred in ODIs (one of only five players to do so), can form an explosive opening partnership with Murali Vijay at the top for Punjab. Chris Jordan - Rs. 50 Lakh (Sunrisers Hyderabad) The death bowling specialist has found a new home with the Sunrisers \nThe right-arm pacer, known to be a specialist death bowler, came in for cheap for the Sunrisers Hyderabad after finding no takers in the first round of the auction. Released by the Royal Challengers Bangalore after failing to live up to their expectations in the last edition, Jordan kept his base price to Rs. 50 Lakh when his teammates pushed their prices over the Rs. 1 crore-mark. \nHe was part of the England squad in the T20Is against India, where he didn’t manage to create much of an impact. A change of IPL teams might do his fortunes a world of good. Asela Gunaratne - Rs.30 Lakh (Mumbai Indians) Gunaratne was rewarded for his sensational performance against Australia \nHero of a sensational heist against Australia to seal the T20 series, Asela Gunaratne stole victory from the jaws of defeat with a whirlwind 84* when 48 were required off the last three overs. \nHe earned a contract straight away, getting a call-up from the Mumbai franchise at the nominal price of Rs. 30 L (which was his base price). A batting all-rounder who can thump the ball high and wide, the 31-year old has been a late bloomer in the international circuit, despite strong performances for his local T20 tournaments. \nFormerly part of the Sri Lankan army, Gunaratne is now famous for his three consecutive sixes in the penultimate over against Australia, and an IPL contract with two-time champions. Mohammad Nabi - Rs. 30 Lakh (Sunrisers Hyderabad) The quintessential all-rounder that he is, Nabi can fit into any T20 side. \nHistory was created when Rashid Khan and Mohammad Nabi became the first players from their country to get an IPL contract. The 31-year old Nabi, a former captain of the Afghanistan national team, has seen his team rise from the shambles of a war-torn country and churn out players who have managed to create waves at the international level. By becoming the first Afghan player to get signed up by an IPL team, Nabi took the world by storm, again. \nHe was snapped up by the Sunrisers Hyderabad for his base price of Rs. 30 L, and can be a potent surprise weapon for the defending champions, batting low down the order and offering his off-spin whenever required. Ishank Jaggi - Rs. 10 Lakh (Kolkata Knight Riders) Jaggi was on fire during the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy \nDrafted just in the nick of time , Jaggi bagged an IPL contract despite not being part of the initial auction list. The 28-year old uncapped batsman, who was earlier contracted with the Deccan Chargers, got signed up by Kolkata Knight Riders at his base price of Rs. 10 Lakh. \nWith scores of 51*, 90 and 58 in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, Jaggi, after consultation with the franchises, was added to the original list of 351 players. His knocks helped East Zone with the title, and ended being the leading run-getter of the tournament. \n-- ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T01:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:04:35.915+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
