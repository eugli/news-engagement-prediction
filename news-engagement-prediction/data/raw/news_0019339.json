Joe was identified as a girl at birth but now lives as a boy.\nThe Bergen Record reported that the 9-year-old joined Pack 20 in Maplewood after the organization’s decision to allow transgender Scouts.\n“This is fun; I’m so proud,” he said during the meeting.\nScout leader Kyle Hackler taught Joe the Cub Scout salute and oath.\n“This means you’re the same as Scouts all over the world,” Hackler told him.\nThe Scout’s mother, Kristie, said she was “proud of the fight” she had put up after the Northern New Jersey Council of Boy Scouts last year told her Joe would not be allowed to continue to be a member of Pack 87 in Secaucus.\nThe Boy Scouts changed their policy of using the gender listed on a child’s birth certificate to determine eligibility after Joe’s story gained national attention.\nThe national organization released a statement welcoming the Maldonado family. “Moving forward, the BSA will continue to work to bring the benefits of our programs to as many children, families and communities as possible,” the statement said.\nMaldonado told the newspaper she had decided to bring her son to Maplewood because she did not want to go back to Secaucus, where she said Scouting officials told her some parents had complained last year.\n— Associated Press\n1 Comments Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share via Email 1 Show Comments Discussion Policy 0 Comments SuperFan Badge\nSuperFan badge holders consistently post smart, timely comments about Washington area sports and teams.\nMore about badges | Request a badge\nCulture Connoisseur Badge\nCulture Connoisseurs consistently offer thought-provoking, timely comments on the arts, lifestyle and entertainment.\nMore about badges | Request a badge\nFact Checker Badge\nFact Checkers contribute questions, information and facts to The Fact Checker .\nMore about badges | Request a badge\nWashingtologist Badge\nWashingtologists consistently post thought-provoking, timely comments on events, communities, and trends in the Washington area.\nMore about badges | Request a badge\nPost Writer Badge\nThis commenter is a Washington Post editor, reporter or producer.\nPost Forum Badge\nPost Forum members consistently offer thought-provoking, timely comments on politics, national and international affairs.\nMore about badges | Request a badge\nWeather Watcher Badge\nWeather Watchers consistently offer thought-provoking, timely comments on climates and forecasts.\nMore about badges | Request a badge\nWorld Watcher Badge\nWorld Watchers consistently offer thought-provoking, timely comments on international affairs.\nMore about badges | Request a badge\nPost Contributor Badge\nThis commenter is a Washington Post contributor.
