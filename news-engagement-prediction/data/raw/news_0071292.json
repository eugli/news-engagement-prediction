He might be a big deal when it comes to assessing the value of old flintlock rifles or paintings someone’s dead granny kept in the attic. He needs to leave the valuation of Tom Brady’s Super Bowl LI jersey to Tom fucking Brady. \nIf anything, a half a million is low for that thing. That’s not just a piece of memorabilia. It’s not some baseball from a no-hitter or a pair of shoes someone wore scoring a touchdown. That is the shirt Brady wore locking up the all time GOAT title. Setting records that will never be broken. Bringing about the culmination of a dream. Plus a redemption story so perfect Hollywood is jumping on it. \nYou can’t put a price on that. The Brady Jersey is a sacred national symbol. It’s the Declaration of Independence with a map to the Freemason’s treasure on the back. Only it’s soaked with his sweat, blood, spit and tears, so it’s like the Shroud of Turin, too. \nThe Houston PD can knock it off as well. 99 years in jail and a $10,000 fine might sound like a lot if this was an old Bum Phillips hat or a Hakeem Olajuwon jersey or some pullover JJ Watt was wearing on the sideline when he set the Most Superfluous TV Reaction Shots record. But this is the Brady Jersey. And anything less than torture that has these despicable little sticky-fingered scumbags praying for death will not do.
