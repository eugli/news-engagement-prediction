This is a song from 1965 by the Orlons. We’re going to use this to send a letter back home.” \nReports of the phone call in question emerged Wednesday night, with news outlets reporting that the leaders of the U.S. and Australia, who have long been allies, got into an argument over refugee policy, which led Trump to end the call abruptly. \nAdditionally, the president took to Twitter to denounce the policy agreement, which would see the U.S. accept 1,250 refugees , as “dumb.” Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal! \n— Donald J.
