The Brit Awards are U.K.'s equivalent of the Grammys, celebrating and paying tribute to U.K. chart and commercial successes. The show is one of the country’s largest music spectacles, with Adele dominating last year’s ceremony, winning four awards. \nPerformers confirmed to hit the stage this year include Katy Perry, Ed Sheeran, Bruno Mars, Little Mix, The 1975, Emeli Sandé, Skepta and Robbie Williams. \nThe awards show will air from London’s O2 Arena live in the U.K. on ITV and in the U.S. on BBC American at 8 p.m. PT as well as being streamed live. Watch it below, and click here for the latest winners. \nTop nominees are Rihanna, Little Mix and Skepta, each scoring three nominations. David Bowie and Drake are among those tied with two noms apiece. \nThe late David Bowie is nominated for British male solo artist and album of the year. He'll vie with The 1975, Kano, Michael Kiwanuka and Skepta for album of the year. Leonard Cohen also received his first Brit Award nomination, posthumously, for international master solo artist. \nFollowing in the footsteps of Bowie and Elton John, Robbie Williams will receive this year's Brit Icon award. \nThis year’s ceremony was originally set to be hosted by Michael Bublé, but the singer had to opt out due to his son’s illness. The show will now be hosted by Dermot O’Leary and Emma Willis. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:59:19.280+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
