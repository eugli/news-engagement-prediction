Since his election in November, he has softened that stance, saying he would keep an \"open mind\" to the climate accord.\nTrump's pick to run the EPA, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, is scheduled to face a Senate confirmation vote on Friday, according to a Senate aide, after a contentious hearing last month in which lawmakers pressed Pruitt on his ties to the oil industry. Pruitt sued the EPA more than a dozen times to block its regulations while he was the top prosecutor for the oil and gas producing state.\nTrump and Pruitt's positions have worried EPA staff, who are concerned the new administration will cut the EPA's budget, critical programs and scientific research. [nL1N1FR1JK]\nSome Republican lawmakers, emboldened by Trump's election, have raised pressure on the EPA in recent days.\nOn Tuesday, Rep. Lamar Smith, chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space and Technology, asked the EPA's inspector general to investigate whether EPA staff were using encrypted messages to coordinate efforts to derail the new administration's agenda, in possible violation of federal records laws.\nEarlier this month, Rep. Matt Gaetz introduced a 45-word bill to \"terminate\" the EPA - a piece of legislation that is not expected to pass.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T08:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T04:19:42.207+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
