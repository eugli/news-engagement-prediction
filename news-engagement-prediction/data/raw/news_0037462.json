I might be skewered for that, but I think it’s work. It’s a lot of work.” \nAnd she admitted that marriage always changes a relationship. They share a two-year-old daughter (Photo: Rex Features) \n“Being married is different than not being married, and anybody who tells you that it's the same, is lying,” she said. \n“It changes things. I have friends who were together for 10 years and then decided to get married, and I’ll ask them on their wedding day or right after if it’s different, and it always is. It is.
