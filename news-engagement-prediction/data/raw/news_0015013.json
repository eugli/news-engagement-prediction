COLDS, SINUSITIS AND BRONCHITIS There's little a doctor can do to treat these winter ailments when they are caused by the many viruses that do the rounds at this time of year. Ensure your vitamin D levels are topped up with a supplement during winter months, which can help to boost immunity. WHAT CAN YOU DO: If symptoms strike then try Pelargonium, a traditional herbal medicine derived from the roots of a South African geranium. It is, in my experience, more effective than anything I can prescribe as a doctor – and its effects are often seen within 12 hours. I swear by it. HOW DOES IT WORK? Pelargonium works in several ways. It has antiviral and antibacterial activity, boosts the activity of immune cells that neutralise infections, and stops bacteria from sticking to cell walls so they are dislodged more easily. It also speeds the rate at which mucus is cleared from the respiratory tract, making it an effective treatment for sore throat, sinusitis, laryngitis and uncomplicated bronchitis. WHEN SHOULD YOU TAKE IT? If taken as soon as symptoms start, Pelargonium can stop a cold in its tracks. Continue to take it for three days after symptoms have resolved to ensure the infection does not resurge. Try Healthspan 's Pelargonium THR Cold Relief, £14.95 2. PAIN Most aches and pains are a minor – or temporary – nuisance, but millions of people around the world experience pain on a daily basis. While paracetamol, ibuprofen and codeine are useful for short-term pain relief, their long-term use is limited by their potential for side effects such as liver damage, stomach ulcers and dependency and heart problems. Turmeric (pictured) provides curcumin – a substance with natural anti-inflammatory effects WHAT YOU CAN DO: Several natural painkillers - which are not associated with serious side effects – are available. And while some people shun natural medicines, it's worth remembering that an estimated 40 per cent of prescription drugs are in fact derived from plant origins. In most cases, herbal supplements contain a blend of constituents that have evolved together over thousands of years to achieve a synergistic balance. This tends to produce a more gentle effect than pharmaceutical extracts which contain only one, isolated active ingredient. The risk of significant side effects with traditional herbal remedies is therefore relatively low, although it is not non-existent. For joint pain, the best options include Devil's Claw, a traditional herbal medicine that is licensed to relieve backache, rheumatic and muscular pain, and general aches and pains in muscles and joints. Other popular options are turmeric which provides curcumin – a substance that has natural anti-inflammatory effects - rosehip extracts and, of course, glucosamine and chondroitin which are often taken together to promote joint health. I take glucosamine, chondroitin and turmeric and was relieved to discover after a recent X-ray following a fall I had no signs of osteoarthritis! HOW DOES IT WORK? Be aware researchers have found there is considerable variation in the way different people respond to different painkillers. Only around 60 per cent people obtain pain relief from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g. ibuprofen, aspirin) for example, due to the metabolic pathways they have inherited. The same is probably true for some supplements used for joint health, so if one doesn't provide significant relief within six weeks, try switching to another form. It's also important to select supplements designed for maximum absorption – if turmeric powder hasn't worked for you in the past, for example, a liquid formulation that is 185 times better absorbed and which is 7-times faster acting than turmeric tablets may produce better results. If you experience migraine headaches, then Feverfew is a traditional herbal medicine licenced for migraine relief. Try Healthspan 's Opti-Tumeric, 60 capsules £14.95 3. INDIGESTION Indigestion and heartburn are often triggered by eating too much rich food. Indigestion is a general term used to describe any discomfort, felt centrally in the upper abdomen, as a result of eating. Heartburn is a more specific term referring to hot, burning sensations due to acid reflux. This is where the stomach contents reflux (splash back) up into the oesophagus - the tube connecting the mouth and stomach. This brings stomach acids and enzymes into contact with the sensitive lining of the oesophagus, and can also trigger painful spasm of muscles lining this area. Artichoke (pictured in a salad) stimulates bile production in the liver to aid fat digestion. Extract of artichoke can be taken before or after a big dinner or party WHAT YOU CAN DO: If indigestion is triggered after eating fatty food such as pastries, you may benefit from artichoke extract which, in my experience, is one of the best supplements to ease feeling bloated. Milk thistle is another option – this traditional herbal medicine is licensed to treat over-indulgence, indigestion and upset stomach, making it a popular first aid essential. HOW DO THESE WORK? Artichoke stimulates bile production in the liver to aid fat digestion; it can be taken before or after a big dinner or party. Milk thistle also acts on the liver and, as well as providing antioxidant protection from the toxic effects of alcohol, also stimulates bile production. Silicolgel is a natural oral gel that forms a soothing coating over the lining of the stomach and intestines, offering relief from acid. However it also binds gases and reduces excess acidity – so can help a wind problem at either end. WHEN SHOULD YOU TAKE THEM? ASAP? Milk thistle, as a medicine, is used to treat symptoms; artichoke is often used for prevention. It's best to take Silicolgel as a preventative measure before you start eating. Try an antacid or other OTC stomach calming products such as Silicolgel from Boots , 200ml £8.29 4. LOW MOOD Anxiety and moods swings can result from the anti-climax of the festive season lack of sunshine, financial worries, and the cold, miserable weather this time of year. There are several things you can do to help life your mood. Yes, they sound simple, but they really can make a big difference: avoid alcohol, try to do things you enjoy and don't isolate yourself. Traditional herbal medicines such as St John's Wort may help to boost your mood WHAT YOU CAN DO: An amino acid called 5-HTP can help to lift mood, or there are traditional herbal medicines such as St John's Wort that may also help. This is a popular traditional herbal medicine which contains several active ingredients/natural antidepressants, including hypericin and hyperforin, to help relieve low mood and treat mild anxiety - and is sometimes referred to as nature's 'sunshine' herb. Please note: While herbal medicines can sometimes be taken alongside conventional medicines, you must NOT combine natural antidepressants with prescribed antidepressants. Also do check with your GP first as St John's Wort in particular does have a number of known interactions (e.g. with the contraceptive pill). HOW DOES IT WORK? 5-HTP stimulates the production of brain chemicals such as serotonin, melatonin and endorphins which are involved in regulating mood. Most prescribed antidepressant drugs also work by raising levels of serotonin in the brain but, rather than increasing the amount of serotonin you make, they block its reabsorption once it is released into the communication gaps (synapses) between brain cells. If you are not making or releasing much serotonin, however, these prescribed antidepressants are not that effective. In contrast, 5-HTP provides the building blocks needed to boost serotonin production and therefore tends to work more quickly and effectively – even in people who have not previously responded to medication. Try Healthspan 's 5-HTP 100mg with zinc and B vitamins 60 tablets £7.48 St John's Wort is thought to work in a similar way to antidepressant medicines, by affecting levels of neurotransmitters such as serotonin in the brain (however, the exact mechanism of action is not known). Try A. Vogel 's Hyperiforce St John's Wort tablets 60 tabs £10.49 (1 tablet 3 times a day) 5. INSOMNIA While we apparently spend a third of our lives asleep, research suggests around 40 per cent of us regularly don't get a good night's rest. Whether it's alcohol or stress, the effects on your life can be devastating. WHAT YOU CAN DO: Dr Meg Arroll, a psychologist says: 'Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been shown to be effective in the treatment of insomnia. So it may be worth exploring talking therapies if you experience regular and prolonged poor sleep.' A 5-HTP supplement can also aid sleep, as well as lift a low mood, but one of the most effective natural remedies is valerian – a traditional herbal medicine that is licensed to aid sleep and relieve sleep disturbances. Valerian contains a number of unique substances that reduce stress and anxiety HOW DOES IT WORK? Valerian contains a number of unique substances that reduce stress and anxiety. They do this by increasing levels of a calming brain chemical called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). In fact, the herb has been used to ease insomnia, anxiety, and nervous restlessness since the second century A.D. Some supplements even combine valerian with hops for an additional sedative action. Another option is pharmaceutical-grade lavender oil, which is a traditional herbal medicine licensed to relieve symptoms of mild anxiety such as stress and nervousness. This effect can aid sleep disturbances that are related to undue worry. Try Healthspan 's Valerian SleepAid, 60 tablets at £15.95 or A.
