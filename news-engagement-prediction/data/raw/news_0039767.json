Source: Supplied \n“So here’s the tip — the new Minister should immediately take steps to give a direction to all principals that from the 16th February 2017, no school in NSW will be registered for, or disseminate any material, being promoted by the Safe Schools Coalition,” he told the Parliament. \n“I call upon the Minister to make that direction immediately.” \nAdvocates for the program argue it is a crucial anti-bullying mechanism. NSW Education Minister Rob Stokes has been thrown in the deep end just weeks into his new portfolio by Liberal colleague Mr Tudehope. Picture: Tim Hunter.   \nBut Mr Tudehope, a well-known opponent of the program, said he would continue to call for its removal. \n“Parents ought to be under no delusion as to the insidious nature with which this program has been introduced into the school system,” he said. \nNew Education Minister Rob Stokes has only been in the job a few weeks, having been shifted from his previous portfolio of planning by Premier Gladys Berejiklian.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T11:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T07:09:50.419+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
