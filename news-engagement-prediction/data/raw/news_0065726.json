Mark Brus of Metro quoted Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas proclaiming he is ready to sell star names if the price is right in the next transfer window. \"We don’t have to do anything, but as we have a squad valued at more than €170m, there will come a time when we have to cash in on that capital,\" Aulas said. \"So, as I did with Karim Benzema and Samuel Umtiti, if a player wants to leave and the offer is acceptable, we won’t stand in the way.\" JEFF PACHOUD/Getty Images Lacazette has been a long-term target of manager Arsene Wenger, but the striker has remained in France despite a clamour for his services. However, the France international said his \"dream\" would be to make a switch to Barcelona in La Liga. He told broadcaster Canal+ (h/t Goal ): \"I think that the right moment has arrived to leave. I think that this summer I will need a change of scenery and [to] discover something else, still with the idea of advancing and progressing in terms of football and as a person.\" Here is the player in action: Lacazette remains one of the continent's most prolific strikers, as highlighted recently by Squawka Football: Squawka Football @Squawka Alexandre Lacazette's goal against AZ was his 100th for Lyon across all competitions since the start of 2013/14. Lethal form. ⚽️ https://t.co/mYIlwCmBlm 2/16/2017, 6:51:09 PM In other Gunners news, Malaga midfielder Pablo Fornals is on Wenger's summer shopping list after his performances in the Spanish league. According to Marca (h/t talkSPORT ), the rising star is being monitored by Arsenal as the Frenchman considers revamping his midfield options. Wenger is said to be considering replacements for Santi Cazorla , who is now in his 30s and suffering with consistent injury. Aitor Alcalde Colomer/Getty Images The 21-year-old has started 17 matches in La Liga this term, scoring four goals, according to WhoScored.com . Cazorla has left a void at the heart of the Arsenal team, and he has been unable to recapture his best fitness for an extended period. Wenger does not have a player who replicates the Spaniard's game, and might be forced to look elsewhere as he attempts to find a balance in his starting XI. Arsenal's midfield needs an injection of youth, and Fornals has quickly proved he has the stomach to play against Spain's best talents.
