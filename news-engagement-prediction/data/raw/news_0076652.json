Lane wore the same top in a photo she posted to Instagram three weeks ago in celebration of Black History Month with the caption, \"But every day, we should celebrate and embrace so don't let the limits of a month confine you.\" \nThe baseball jersey is by Mizizi and retails for $75 . According to Mizizi shop, the jersey features, \"A splash of Ghanaian influence, the Adrinka symbol of 'Sankofa' lies on the right sleeve, symbolizing the necessity of reflection and growth, whereas on [sic] the left sleeve bears the raised black fist to further promote support and solidarity. Lastly, running across the back holds MIZIZI with 1865 directly below, corresponding with the year slavery was abolished in the United States.\" \nLane recently landed one of the covers of Teen Vogue 's relaunched quarterly print issues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T04:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:28:49.446+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
