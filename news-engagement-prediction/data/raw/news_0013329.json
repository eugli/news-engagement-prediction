But the suspect started firing at officers through a door or window. \nWalker was shot in the upper body and was taken by CareFlite to Denton Regional Hospital where he was surrounded by family, friends and fellow officers. \nHe later died from his injuries. \nAccording to KRLD’s L.P. Phillips, the Tarrant County Medical Examiner says 46-year-old Rudy Garcia’s death was caused by a gunshot wound to the head… but more importantly, he was killed by returned gun fire from Little Elm officers. \nLittle Elm Police Chief Rodney Harrison said Garcia remained barricaded in his home until his death sometime before 10:20 p.m that day. \nJerry Garcia said his brother, Rudy, suffered from schizophrenia and believes he was off of his medication when the fatal shooting took place. \nThis is a developing news story.
