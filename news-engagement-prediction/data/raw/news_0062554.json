Ru’a Ahmed Sa’id Hamdan, 14, bagged the gold prize for performing a dance set to a song glorifying violence against Israelis.\nPMW translated the song’s lyrics as follows:\nThe Zionists coveted [our] homeland,\nCompounding damage and enmity\nBut the popular revolution awaits [them]\nThe orchard called us to the struggle\nWe replaced bracelets with weapons\nWe attacked the despicable [Zionists]\nWe do not want [internal] strife or disputes\nWhile this invading enemy is on the battlefield\nThis is the day that jihad is needed\nPull the trigger.\nWe shall redeem Jerusalem, Nablus and the country.\nThe Yafa Cultural Center’s Facebook page describes itself as a cultural NGO formed by the Committee for the Defense of Palestinian Refugee Rights with the aim of improving “the cultural and intellectual condition of Palestinians by providing them with a space to develop their talents and skills and to enrich their awareness of their national rights through civic education particularly on democracy and human rights.”\nThrough a variety of activities the center hopes to “empower Palestinians in fostering a strong and independent identity … while escaping the negative effects of the on-going Israeli occupation.”\nOfficial Palestinian Authority television broadcast a performance of the same song in 2010.\nThe three top scoring dancers at the Yafa dance competition were awarded maps of “Palestine” replacing all of Israel’s territory, in gold, silver, and bronze respectively.\n Jerusalem , Breitbart TV , National Security , Children , Dance , Fatah , Funeral , glorifying terror , honoring martyrs , Israel , Israel-Arab conflict , Nablus , Palestinian Authority , Palestinian Terrorism , President Mahmoud Abbas , refugees , Terrorists , Yafa cultural center", "external_links": ["http://www.palwatch.org/main.aspx?fi=157&doc_id=20484", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/twitter/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fjerusalem%2F2017%2F02%2F22%2Fpalestinian-dance-competition-winner-performs-to-jihad-song-pull-the-trigger%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=WATCH%3A+Palestinian+Dance+Competition+Winner+Performs+To+%E2%80%98Jihad%E2%80%99+Song+%E2%80%98Pull+The+Trigger%E2%80%99&shortener=bitly", "http://palwatch.org/main.aspx?fi=475&fld_id=475&doc_id=3179", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/GGCk1keeVeU", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/google_plusone_share/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fjerusalem%2F2017%2F02%2F22%2Fpalestinian-dance-competition-winner-performs-to-jihad-song-pull-the-trigger%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=WATCH%3A+Palestinian+Dance+Competition+Winner+Performs+To+%E2%80%98Jihad%E2%80%99+Song+%E2%80%98Pull+The+Trigger%E2%80%99", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/facebook/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fjerusalem%2F2017%2F02%2F22%2Fpalestinian-dance-competition-winner-performs-to-jihad-song-pull-the-trigger%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=WATCH%3A+Palestinian+Dance+Competition+Winner+Performs+To+%E2%80%98Jihad%E2%80%99+Song+%E2%80%98Pull+The+Trigger%E2%80%99", "https://www.facebook.com/pg/YafaCenterPS/about/?ref=page_internal"], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:03:48.646+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
