There is no self discovery like the kind music gives to you and through my work and my journey, I’ve been lucky to have experienced and witnessed some of the best musicians in our country and the more legendary ones from outside create and produce music that united the world and every soul, in one way or another. How often do you find something that does that in the kind of world that we live in? © GoSupersonic \nAnd it’s because of this exposure that I have had, through my own journey without any external help, that I can sit and write this to all of you who are reading this. And if you’re anything like me, then I can vouch for the fact that you’re going to be headed to Pune this weekend for one of the most awaited homegrown festivals in the country—Vh1 Supersonic. It’s every ardent Indian Dance music fans bucket list goal to watch the legendary Eric Prydz perform on Indian soil and it’s finally coming true.
