Photo: Wade Laube \nThe study by the University of NSW of a typical weekday morning shows second place for speed of travel is to the site of the new Northern Beaches Hospital at Frenchs Forest, which had 69 per cent of people get there within half an hour. \nIt was followed closely behind by Liverpool at 67 per cent. However, more people got to Liverpool within 45 minutes than Frenchs Forest.

So the distance from home to work is a lot less,\" he said. \nHowever, the push for Parramatta to become Sydney's second CBD, and an \"aerotropolis\" further west around the planned new airport at Badgerys Creek, would significantly increase population and pressure on the transport network. \n\"We need to ... make sure we don't lose the accessibility that we have out west in some of these employment centres,\" he said. \n\"There is a real opportunity to use this data to try to at least maintain, if not improve, the accessibility of those western employment centres.\" \nProfessor Pettit said greater investment in public transport, including cycle and walking paths, was needed in these areas to ensure they kept pace with the surge in population and the push to attract more businesses. \nThe researchers examined trips from anywhere on the public transport network to the employment centres during the morning peak period on a typical weekday. \nTravel times on public transport to Sydney's central business district performed reasonably well because \"through the hub-and-spokes model all roads lead to Rome\". \nAbout 69 per cent of trips to the CBD are with 45 minutes, while only 12 per cent of commuters take longer than an hour. \nThe CBD has more three times the number of journeys on a typical workday than the next biggest destination of Chatswood. \nThe study was conducted to inform the district plan for the Greater Sydney Commission, which selected the key centres it was focusing on from the perspective of the so-called 30-minute city.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:32:10.166+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
