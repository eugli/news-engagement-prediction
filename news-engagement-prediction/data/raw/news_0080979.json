The latter won the first prize on tiebreak. \nMore fast draws were likely to appear in the final round, but eventually only two games went that way. The all-Russian encounter between Dmitry Jakovenko and Ian Nepomniachtchi on board three was the first to end in a draw. \nSoon tournament leaders   and Alexander Grischuk followed suit. With this, they secured shared first place. \nMVL: \"I started well, but then somehow things didn't fall into place. I didn't manage to create problems to all my opponents. I would have been happier if I could have produced a little more content in my games.\" Shared first in Sharjah Grand Prix! A good and very important result, but I would have liked to produce a little more content in my games. \nGrischuk: \"It's hard to be upset because I sort of produced the maximum result in the last two rounds.\" With a boring draw MVL and Grischuk secured first place. \nPaco Vallejo and Evgeny Tomashevsky drew a Nimzo-Indian in 22 moves, and then provided some interesting comments about playing such tournaments. \nVallejo, who ended up as the only player to play nine draws: \"It's the first time in my life. In general I have an aggressive style, I think, but here everything went in the other direction somehow.\" @anishgiri Let's see if you can improve this result in the next GP !! — Paco Vallejo ( @Chessidharta ) February 27, 2017 Vallejo trying to remember his Nimzo preparation. \nTomashevsky: \"I played very poor chess. In the competitions of the World Championship cycle preparation plays a big role: opening wise, psychologically, mentally. All players are trying to play more solid chess and more accurate lines comparing to the usual tournaments. If you are not well prepared in the openings or mentally or energetically, you will have problems.\" \nBut then the round saw a big development as Shakhriyar Mamedyarov defeated Hou Yifan . That wasn't the best present for the reigning women's world champion (for just a few more days!), who turned 23 today. \n\"I think my best game was today. It's her birthday, but what to do!\" said Mamedyarov. \nIn doing so, Mamedyarov caught the leaders in first place. A very aggressive attitude in a Nimzo-Indian was very successful for the Azerbaijani: A happy Mamedyarov after playing his best game of the tournament. \nAt the press conference Mamedyarov repeated that he shouldn't have played for a win in the endgame against Grischuk. And it was funny to hear that despite his 2772 live rating, he still seems room for improvement. \n\"After the game I was checking my computer. I think after this tournament I think I need to [read] books. Dvoretsky's books, how to play these positions, who is better..\" \nExcept perhaps for the last round, Hou Yifan played an excellent tournament (with eight draws). Mamedyarov only had one mishap in the penultimate round, but can be satisfied with that shared first place obviously. Despite a loss on her birthday Hou Yifan was smiling too today. \nRichard Rapport vs Li Chao started promising, with White pushing both his a- and h-pawns up the board in the opening. That happened to be all over-the-board inspiration. \nRapport: \"Brilliant preparation by me. After 2...d5 I was on my own. Kind of ridiculous.\" \nUnfortunately the game ended rather abruptly, like we've seen in other games in this tournament. Rapport: \"I the final position I felt by principle I must be worse somehow. And if I am worse, it's not a bit, it's really worse. If we exchange queens it's game over basically.\" \"We're humans, not robots.\" Well, except for Rapport's tie today. \nPavel Eljanov played 1.e4, the recent addition to his repertoire, and nicely defeated Salem Saleh . After round seven the Ukrainian lamented that he was lacking form, but against two lower rated players he was a strong force nonetheless. \n\nLevon Aronian wasn't playing a great tournament, and his final-round loss made it even worse. He went down against Ding Liren in a Catalan, where just before the time control the tactics favored White. \"I became careless. I thought that I equalized finally,\" Aronian said. \nThe difference between a draw and a loss was quite substantial for the Grand Prix points. Maybe Aronian had this in mind when he said: \"The positive thing is that the tournament is finished. The other games I played badly but I'm very ashamed of my play today.\" Ding finished a lightly disappointing tournament with an excellent win. Michael Adams , who had to play with the black pieces for the third day in a row, again managed to defend a long and tough game. Theoretically he and Hikaru Nakamura could have joined the leaders, but now they tied for fourth place. Alexander Riazantsev ended last, after drawing with Jon Ludvig Hammer . Well done Hammer! @gmjlh outperforms his seeding in Sharjaj. Been a while since a Norwegian did that in the Chess World Championship cycle. — Peter Heine Nielsen ( @PHChess ) February 27, 2017 For the overall Grand Prix there is no clear winner, and the official regulations ( here in PDF ) even state that \"no tiebreak system will be utilised for the individual Grand Prix tournaments.\" However, at the technical meeting it was decided to have a tiebreak anyway for distributing the medals that were arranged by the local organizers. Grischuk, therefore, emerged as the winner since he had the best score in the group of three winners (his win vs Mamedyarov decided here). 2017 Sharjah Grand Prix | Final Standings Rk.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:50:36.654+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
