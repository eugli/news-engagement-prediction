But as one comic after another recalls triumphs, misadventures and painful lessons learned, the stories become redundant. – Stephen Holden, New York Times, Feb 23, 2017 \nFresh: Even though they all tend to make the same points, the number of comics talked to and their widely diverse personalities and war stories insure that interest never flags. – Kenneth Turan, Los Angeles Times, Feb 23, 2017 \nFresh: Though the engaging documentary treads through unavoidably familiar territory ... its chorus of testifiers often find sharp new angles of approach. Like the jokes they hone, many of their insights arrive with the impact of well-crafted punchlines. – Sheri Linden, Hollywood Reporter, Dec 16, 2016 \nFresh: It's great and it's valuable and it's wonderful, because we love seeing and hearing these all-time greats talk about what they do with such passion and candor. – Richard Roeper, Chicago Sun-Times, Feb 23, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T13:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T10:17:06.682+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
