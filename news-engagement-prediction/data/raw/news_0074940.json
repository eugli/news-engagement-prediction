For first time the failing @nytimes will take an ad (a bad one) to help save its failing reputation. Try reporting accurately & fairly! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 26, 2017 \n“What does that mean in a world of ‘fake news’? And what is the role of journalism and journalists in that process, and what is the role of the reader in supporting that journalism? \n“We think it's a great metaphor for how hard it is on a regular basis to understand the truth. \n“That leads into the role that we think journalism can play in helping you cut through that clutter and make your own sense of what's going on in the world.” FAKE NEWS media knowingly doesn't tell the truth. A great danger to our country. The failing @nytimes has become a joke. Likewise @CNN . Sad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2017 \nThe TV campaign will also appear in print form and run on billboards in New York, Los Angeles, Washington DC and San Francisco. \nIt was the first TV advert since The Weekender commercials of 2009. \nMr Trump tweeted yesterday: \"For first time the failing @nytimes will take an ad (a bad one) to help save its failing reputation. Try reporting accurately & fairly!” \nThe previous day he wrote: “FAKE NEWS media knowingly doesn't tell the truth. A great danger to our country. The failing @nytimes has become a joke. Likewise @CNN. Sad!” \nOnline audio book service Audible also ran a politically-charged advert. \nActor Zachary Quinto read a passage from the novel 1984, which some also interpreted as a criticism of the US president. \nHe reads how \"most of what\" protagonist Winston Smith had been told about foreigners “were lies”.
