By: FE Online | Published: February 20, 2017 4:27 PM Tracking Pulsar Sunil’s latest phone records, the Kerala police had narrowly missed arresting him at the Ambalapuzha residence. \nA major setback in the Malayalam actress molestation case is that Pulsar Sunil – the main accused – has approached Kerala High Court, pleading for an opportunity to be given a fair and just hearing. He has filed an anticipatory bail plea before the Kerala High Court this afternoon. This plea will be heard tomorrow. \nTracking Pulsar Sunil’s latest phone records, the Kerala police had narrowly missed arresting him at the Ambalapuzha residence. He escaped just before they could catch him. \nPulsar Sunil’s counsel EC Paulose told Manorama News at 4 PM today, “They came to me with a cover, some documents, a white mobile phone and a passport. We have presented this as evidence before the court to show the innocence of the accused and the court has accepted the documents with a memo. We are aware that this is a highly important case and therefore from our side, we will co-operate and extend support in every possible way as we know that the accused in this case are innocent.” \nYou may also like to watch: \nAccording to local TV news reports, the actress did not name anyone from the film industry but the police have reason to believe that those who had abducted and molested the actress had other intentions which may be part of a wider conspiracy. \nMartin, the driver who was reportedly driving the car on the said night, had been arrested earlier for conspiring to commit the crime. \nThe latest move by Pulsar Suni to file anticipatory bail plea before the Kerala High Court has come as a jolt for the police as they have not been able to make any significant breakthrough in this case.
