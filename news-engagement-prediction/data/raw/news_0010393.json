In other words, a buyer could deduct the entire net interest paid on the home loan. \n\n\"Government resources are very very limited. The question is should the government be subsidizing first-time home owners who are occupying own house or should the government be subsidising the second acquisition of the property by people who have got surplus money to invest in real estate,\" Adhia said while addressing industry representatives here. \n\nHe cited an example: \"If I have already my own house, I buy a new property by taking a bank loan of Rs 1 crore, the interest on it is Rs 10 lakh per annum and I rent it out to somebody who gives out Rs 3 lakh as rent, the remaining Rs 7 lakh you could offset against your salary income or business income.\" \n\nThe loss to the government for the second house were almost one third of that, he said, adding that it came to about Rs 3 lakh in addition to Rs 2 lakh advantage. \n\n\"So, why should the government bear the cost of second house acquisition, that was the question. We have a lot of people to be given affordable housing, we need to help them out... so the revenue loss was huge and people were virtually misusing it,\" he said. \n\nThe Finance Bill , 2017, proposes to restrict such set-off of house property loss to Rs 2,00,000 per annum only. Balance loss, if any, will be carried forward to be set off against house property income of subsequent 8 years. \n\nHence, individual tax payers having loss of more than Rs 2,00,000 will now have a higher tax outgo. \n\n\"In line with the international best practices, it is proposed to insert sub-section (3A) in the said section to provide that set-off of loss under the head 'Income from house property' against any other head of income shall be restricted to Rs 2 lakh for any assessment year,\" the Finance Bill 2017 said. \n\n\"However, the unabsorbed loss shall be allowed to be carried forward for set-off in subsequent years in accordance with the existing provisions of the Act.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T23:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T13:15:10.797+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
