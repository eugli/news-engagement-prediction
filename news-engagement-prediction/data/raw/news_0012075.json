For a sense of what is happening outside, he watches cable, both at night and during the day — too much in the eyes of some aides — often offering a bitter play-by-play of critics like CNN’s Don Lemon. \nUntil the past few days, Mr. Trump was telling his friends and advisers that he believed the opening stages of his presidency were going well. “Did you hear that, this guy thinks it’s been terrible!” Mr. Trump said mockingly to other aides when one dissenting view was voiced last week during a West Wing meeting. \nBut his opinion has begun to change with a relentless parade of bad headlines. \nThe report also says that Trump does keep tabs on media coverage––”watching television in his bathrobe,” they write at one point––and he goes through news clips with Spicer, “marking the ones he does not like with a big arrow in black Sharpie.” \nIn addition, one portion of the report notes that the president “was not fully briefed on details of the executive order he signed giving his chief strategist [ Steve Bannon ] a seat on the National Security Council.” \nAccording to The Hill , Spicer responded to that report by saying, “That report was so riddled with inaccuracies and lies that they owe the president an apology. There were just literally blatant factual errors and it’s unacceptable to see that kind of reporting or so-called reporting.” \nOne of the inaccuracies he cited was what Trump wears while watching TV, telling reporters, “I don’t think the president owns a bathrobe; he definitely doesn’t wear one.” \nThe president tweeted about the report earlier today: The failing @nytimes writes total fiction concerning me. They have gotten it wrong for two years, and now are making up stories & sources! \n— Donald J.
