The couple were already parents to a twin son and daughter, Nico and Siena, who will turn 3 at the end of April. \n“Nico and Siena have been so excited for their baby sisters to arrive,” Cannici told The Huffington Post. “They spent months snuggled with mama’s pregnant belly, talking and singing to the unborn babies. Now that they are here, they are incredibly gentle with them, and love holding and feeding them. It is so amazing to see.” West on Jade Photography Gia and Gemma were born on Jan. 26. \nWhen the babies were 11 days old, Cannici set out to take sibling photos of both sets of twins together. The mom rented cute outfits from a children’s clothing boutique and set up her home studio for a fun photo shoot. \n“I was so set on capturing Nico and Siena holding the babies in the outfits I had rented,” she said. “But Nico and Siena were SO bored with me, the photos looked terrible. I was disappointed.” West on Jade Photography Cannici's photo shoot of the siblings did not go as initially planned. \nCannici took Nico and Siena out of their fancy rental clothes and let them play for a bit. After playtime, they came back into the studio to take more photos. The mom laid them down and snuggled with their siblings \n“They immediately held hands and wrapped the other arm around their baby sisters,” Cannici recalled. “I got them to smile by asking them to ‘act goofy,’ which they recently decided is just a hilarious saying.” \nThat’s when she captured this adorable skin-to-skin bonding photo.

I will keep them safe forever,’” she said. “We are taken aback by how seamless a transition it has been for all of us.” West on Jade Photography The transition from one set of twins to two has been surprisingly seamless, Cannici says. West on Jade Photography Cannici and her wife struggled to have babies for years. \nCannici and her wife, Nikki, have been married for almost 11 years. The photographer told HuffPost they struggled for years to get pregnant through IVF before welcoming Nico and Siena. “We struggled, in different ways, again with Gia and Gemma,” she added. \n“I hope when people look at that photo they can see the true joy,” Cannici said of her viral image. “To see our babies all together makes me feel such happiness and accomplishment . The joy you see on Nico and Siena’s faces is entirely genuine.” \nKeep scrolling and visit Cannici’s Facebook page to see more adorable photos of the family.
