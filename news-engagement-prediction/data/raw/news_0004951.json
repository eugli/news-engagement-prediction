Most Popular By Avery Thompson Jan 30, 2017 NASA scientists using the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope have found five of the oldest, brightest, and most distant \"blazar\" galaxies in the universe . Blazars are a type of quasar, a form of proto-galaxy found in the early universe. Like all quasars, blazars have supermassive black holes in their centers that send out massive jets of energy. These jets can be extremely bright when they come from quasars, but the jets from blazars are unique because they point directly at us.   These galaxies were formed less than 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang, a tenth of the universe's current age. The galaxies also have some of the largest supermassive black holes ever recorded, providing crucial information on how these ancient galaxies formed.
