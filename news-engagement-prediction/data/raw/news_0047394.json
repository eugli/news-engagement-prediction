She worked as a switchboard operator and devoted herself to public service, volunteering for 45 years with the Girls Scouts and earning the organization’s highest award, the Thanks Badge. She passed on Monday at age 87 in Norwalk, Ohio, in hospice care, but she got in one final dig at President Donald Trump on her way out. \n“Liz is smiling now,” reads one line in her obituary , “not to be living during the Trump Presidency.” Screengrab via Norwalk Funeral Home “She had seen that in somebody else’s obituary and kind of made a note of that,” Deborah Lucal, Smith’s daughter, told the Sandusky Register . “She doesn’t like the man, she never has, thought he was a pompous ass.”\nSmith certainly isn’t the first to air grievances against Trump via an obituary notice. In October, before the election, a man in North Carolina requested that his obit include the line “Do not vote for Donald Trump.” \nRIP.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T20:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T00:08:12.798+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
