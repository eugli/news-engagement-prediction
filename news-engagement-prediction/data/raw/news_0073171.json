Photograph: Frank Hoensch/Redferns View more sharing options Andrew Harrison Sunday 26 February 2017 09.00 GMT \nI t takes a certain attunement to the mood of Brexit Britain to turn up at the London Palladium – that bastion of middling light entertainment where even Wednesday night is Sunday night – dressed as Napoleon. Neil Hannon , owner-operator of the Divine Comedy, wears the breeches and bicorn hat of Britain’s original continental bete noire with panache, though, and has the song to match. The new songs showcase Hannon’s ability to switch from the ironic to the heartfelt without crashing gears \nNapoleon Complex , given a lusty airing tonight, both mocks and celebrates the delusions of grandeur that drive the non-tall male, a community of which Hannon is a proud member. “Who pulls the strings? Who makes the deals?” he sings. “Stands five foot three in Cuban heels?” It’s the Divine Comedy in a Fabergé nutshell, employing history, humour and bathos to look at the best and worst of the insecure male mind. \nIn these straitened times for independent, grown-up pop music, it is something of a coup for the Divine Comedy to sell out three nights at one of London’s most venerable theatres. The days when Hannon – buoyed by 90s hits such as Something for the Weekend and National Express – could splash out on orchestras and horn sections are gone. But his band’s current, compact five-piece incarnation (also dressed in 18th-century French military uniform) delivers a robust take on the Divine Comedy’s catalogue of miniature film soundtracks and intimate adult pop. \nHannon’s musical project was once described as an Edwardian Pet Shop Boys; detractors consider them over-literate to the point of tweeness, as if what pop needs is less cleverness. Such is the price of a defined identity, and it certainly gives the Divine Comedy options. This evening their Mitteleuropean flavours, Hannon’s Jacques-Brel-meets-music-hall delivery and the art nouveau backdrop of new album Foreverland combine to make the Palladium feel a world – and a time – apart. \nOne of the benefits of a dedicated audience is their tolerance for new material. Tonight is accordingly heavy on songs from Foreverland , which showcase Hannon’s ability to switch from the ironic to the heartfelt without crashing gears. The comic How Can You Leave Me on My Own? laments the domestic uselessness of a man alone to the accompaniment of a powerpop stomp. In the delicate To the Rescue , Hannon’s lover is his superheroine salvation. The evening’s most affecting moment is a rendition of Hannon’s best song, the poignant, accordion-driven A Lady of a Certain Age . Here, he effectively rewrites Peter Sarstedt’s cheeseball standard Where Do You Go to (My Lovely) from a position of compassion rather than scorn towards a Med-hopping socialite, now in the reduced circumstances of her twilight years. Watch the video for The Divine Comedy’s Catherine the Great. \nStricken by a cold, the singer is not at his vocal best tonight, although he cleverly weaves his remedies into the stage show with much amusing business concerning hot whisky, towels, steaming water and a roadie in a tie called Alistair. Nobody’s idea of a pop idol – least of all his own – Hannon has turned this self-deprecation into a minor heroism and a licence to play comic roles from Napoleon to the perverted city gent (with costume change) of The Complete Banker. Almost 27 years into their existence, the Divine Comedy remain a life-affirming joy.
