PHOTOS | FILE | COURTESY By BRIAN WASUNA \nNational Land Commission (NLC) chairman Muhammad Swazuri has ordered the United Arab Emirates to return to the Kenya Railways pension scheme a piece of land in Nairobi’s Upper Hill area that former President Daniel arap Moi gave its ruler. \nDr Swazuri issued the directive after the commission found that the land was initially allocated to the Kenya Railways Staff Retirement Benefits Scheme (KRSRBS) in 1965, and Mr Moi’s decision to gift the prime property to UAE ruler Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan 25 years ago was illegal. \nThe NLC has subsequently ordered the chief land registrar to revoke a title deed Mr Al-Nahyan was given in 1990 for the prime property that is estimated to be worth Sh500 million, and revert its ownership to the KRSRBS. \nWELFARE CENTRE \nMr Moi gave Mr Al-Nahyan the land in January 1990 to construct the Sheikh Zayed Children Welfare Centre. \nMr Al-Nahyan was the man behind the formation of UAE and ruled the country for 33 years until his death on November 2, 2004 at the age of 85. \nHis gift has since been managed by trustees—Rajab Sumba and Khan Mirhassan—who appeared before the NLC. \n“The property was vested to the KRSRBS at the time it was allegedly being allocated to Registered Trustees of Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan. Once land is registered it is not available for allocation to another party. Therefore the land was not available for allocation to anyone, not even the Registered Trustees of Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan by President Moi.” \nRead the full story here . \nSOURCE: Business Daily ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T13:35:12.909+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
