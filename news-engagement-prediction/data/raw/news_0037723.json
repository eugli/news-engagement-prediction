One is of Major, played by Scarlett Johansson ( The Avengers ), and the other is the robot Geisha that we got a look at in the trailers. WETA Workshop posted the figures on their website today. Both are limited edition with only 500 figures available. The figures are rather pricey at $499, but the detail is incredible for both of them. They’re made from “high-quality polystone,” and have an illuminating base and fabric costume elements, which the website says is a first for WETA Workshop. The figures were designed and sculpted by Linsdey Crummett and Gary Hunt. \nThe site explains, “Weta Workshop spent more than ten months immersed in the incredible future-tech world of Ghost in the Shell. Working closely with director Rupert Sanders and his production team, the Workshop helped translate this iconic manga into a reimagined live-action setting, before bringing those concepts to life through more than 3000 prosthetics, animatronics, props, miniatures and specialty costumes.” \nThe WETA Ghost in the Shell Major figure measures 11.02″ x 16.92″ x 11.02″ (W x H x D) and weighs 8.81 lbs. The Geisha figures measures 9.84″ x 17.32″ x 7.87″ (W x H x D) and weighs 5.95 lbs. Major is wearing her thermoptic suit in the figure. The description from the site states, “The Major’s thermoptic suit was to be a centrepiece of Ghost in the Shell and represented a benchmark for Weta Workshop’s creativity and innovation. Taking digital scans of actress Scarlett Johansson, the Workshop built an extraordinary physical effects suit unlike anything it had attempted before. Cast in a smooth, translucent silicone over a mesh fabric, it adhered to The Major like a second skin; a piece of technology, both practical and iconic.” \nAbout the Geisha, the site says, “A pivotal action sequence called for a series of beautiful but deadly Geisha. With costume designers Kurt and Bart, the Workshop helped design distinctive make-up, hair and kimono ensembles, imbuing each character with a unique look to be recreated on the Workshop floor. Featuring sculptural wigs, silicone limbs, and animatronic masks with moving jaws, these Geisha pushed Weta Workshop into new creative territory, expanding the scope of what could be achieved through physical effects.” \nCheck out the WETA Ghost in the Shell images in the gallery viewer below. You can order Major here and the Geisha here . Ghost In the Shell will hit theaters on March 31, 2017. The film also stars Takeshi Kitano, Juliette Binoche , Pilou Asbæk , Kaori Momoi, Chin Han, Danusia Samal, Yutaka Izumihara, Tuwanda Manyimo and Rila Fukushima.
