How does this policy affect families? \nBritish national Laura Segan and her American husband Spencer Russ are facing the possibility of separation less than a year after they have got married. \n\"Just because she happens to fall in love with me and I have the wrong passport, she isn't allowed to live with me in her own country,\" says Spencer, 28. \nHis student visa expired in January and he has applied for leave to remain in the UK, but if that is rejected he will be deported. \nFull-time graduate student Laura would then need to earn a minimum of £18,600 per year for a minimum amount of six months in order to bring her husband back to the UK. 'Ridiculous' \nLaura, from Devon, says she cannot work full-time while she is studying. \"It doesn't seem right,\" the 28-year-old says. \n\"I think it is ridiculous to put a financial requirement on love,\" adds Spencer, who met his wife when they were both teaching English in Russia. \nThey are just two people out of thousands who are said to be unable to earn enough to meet the minimum income requirement that came into force in July 2012. \nUnder the family migration policy, only British citizens, or those with refugee status, who earn at least £18,600 a year can sponsor their non-European spouse's visa. This salary level must have been held for at least six months prior to the application. \nThe level rises to £22,400 for a non-European spouse and child, with an additional levy of £2,400 for each additional child. The rule does not apply to EU citizens. \nThose who are granted the \"family of a settled person\" visa cannot usually claim benefits or other public funds. \nThe Home Office introduced the rules as part of attempts to control immigration from outside Europe, with ministers in the then coalition government arguing that the rules would ensure no incoming families would burden the UK taxpayer.

'Computer mummy' \nAndy Russell, from Bath, reluctantly describes himself as \"one of the lucky ones\". \n\"Yet I don't feel that,\" he says.

It is a scandal,\" Andy says. \nThe Children's Commissioner for England says that at least 15,000 children are separated from a parent because of the income rules and are growing up in \"Skype families\".
