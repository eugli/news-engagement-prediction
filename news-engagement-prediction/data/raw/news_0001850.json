WHY DIESELS ARE NOW BEING DEMONISED By Colin Fernandez, Science Correspondent for The Daily Mail Diesel cars used to be seen as a greener option than petrol. But now they are blamed for producing more polluting gases that lead to major health problems and even death. So why have diesel engines suddenly become demonised? The answer is that for years the Government’s priority was to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide – the gas that produces global warming. Following the Kyoto agreement of 1997, most governments agreed to cut carbon dioxide. Diesel was seen as a saviour because it produces less carbon dioxide than petrol engines. Lured by generous road tax incentives, Britons bought them in droves. The dash for diesel was such that in 2013 the engines powered 34.5 per cent of cars on the road – a massive increase from the 7.4 per cent in 1994. But increasing air pollution is now thought to cause up to 50,000 deaths in Britain a year. Carbon dioxide damages the atmosphere, but it does not affect humans, unlike two pollutants increasingly found to harm health that are made in greater quantities by diesels – nitrogen dioxide and particulates. British levels of nitrogen dioxide – which causes respiratory problems – are so high they breach legal limits in 37 out of 45 regions. The Supreme Court told the Government last year to come up with anti-pollution plans by April 24 for cities that exceed legal pollution limits. Around 80 per cent of nitrogen dioxide pollution in cities is from transport. A further threat to clean air are particulates – tiny specks of soot or unburnt fuel invisible to the naked eye which can penetrate deep into the lungs. Since the early Nineties, evidence has built up that the particles are harmful to health, causing early death, hospital admissions, allergic reactions, lung dysfunction and cardiovascular diseases. In the letter to Mr Hammond, signed by 17 MPs, Mr Elphicke accused local authorities of using diesel drivers as a 'cash cow', adding: 'Our first concern is that local authorities may view the pollution worries people understandably have as an opportunity to tax motorists more. 'The proposal by Westminster to charge 50 per cent more to park smacks of opportunistic greed. 'We consider that this policy is ill-judged as well as unlawful. 'It would have the effect of penalising vehicles with modern, clean, diesel engines as much as older, dirtier vehicles. This policy therefore looks more like an attempt to raise revenue than a serious attempt to tackle pollution.' Mr Elphicke added: 'It is wrong for diesel drivers to be demonised by councils whether in London or in Birmingham. 'These people were encouraged to buy their cars thinking they were doing the right thing. They need to be helped with a replacement scheme – not punished.' There are more than 12.7million diesel cars on Britain's roads. Almost half of all cars sold each year have diesel engines, with 1.3million sold in 2016. Some scientists say they pose a greater health risk than petrol engines because they emit more nitrogen dioxide and toxic particles, which contribute to thousands of early deaths each year from respiratory problems. The 2015 scandal in which manufacturers were found to have put so-called defeat devices into diesel vehicles allowing them to pass emissions tests they would otherwise fail has increased concerns. But newer models are cleaner, and the drivers of older ones say they were encouraged to buy them by the Government because of their lower carbon dioxide emissions. Mr Elphicke wants the Government to set up a national replacement scheme, in which drivers receive tax incentives to scrap their diesel cars and replace them with cleaner electric vehicles. The Government has been told by EU and British courts to tackle pollution and air quality, and ministers have encouraged local councils to improve air quality. Howard Cox, founder of the FairFuelUK campaign, said: 'We are seeing more short-sighted, selfish local authorities looking at penalising diesel drivers with punitive taxation, congestion fees and now by hiking parking charges.' A spokesman for Westminster council said: 'We are trialling a diesel surcharge in the hope that it will deter drivers of the most polluting vehicles from entering Marylebone, a hotspot for pollution.'
