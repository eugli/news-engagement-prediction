different ages, life experiences and opinions,' it said, adding that it would advocate polities that protect 'our business, our team, and our community.'\n'Based off the release that KP sent out this morning, and what he told me last night, that's the Under Armour that I know,' Curry said.\n'That's the brand I know he's built and one that, as of Wednesday afternoon, is something that I'm standing on.'\nAnd in case anyone thinks that the massive sponsorship contract Curry signed in 2015 is leading him, he added a disclaimer.\n'If I can say the leadership is not in line with my core values, then there is no amount of money, there is no platform I wouldn’t jump off, if it wasn’t in line with who I am,' he promised.\nUnder Armour will be happy to hear that - one analyst told Business Insider last year that the player was worth as much as $14 billion to the company.\nCurry isn't the only basketball legend who's got beef with the Trump administration.\nLeBron James took the president to task last week after he accepted the Jackie Robinson Award at the NAACP Image Awards, footage of which will air on TV One on Saturday.\nStanding up: LeBron James is similarly unimpressed by Trump. Last week, after being given the Jackie Robinson Award, the athlete said the anti-Muslim ban 'does not represent' the US\nTaking aim at Trump's proposed south border Wall and his attempted ban on US visa holders from a selection of mostly Muslim countries, James told The Hollywood Reporter that 'Diversity is what makes this country so great.'\n'We should all continue to speak up and fight for ideas that bring people together regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, religious beliefs or any other differences,' he continued.\nAnd when it came to the Muslim travel ban, he said: 'I am not in favor of this policy or any policy that divides and excludes people.\n'I stand with the many, many Americans who believe this does not represent what the United States is all about. And we should continue to speak out about it.'", "external_links": ["http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/02/08/stephen-curry-respond-to-trump-love-from-under-amours-ceo/", "http://www.businessinsider.com/steph-curry-worth-14-billion-to-under-armour-2016-3", "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lebron-james-donald-trumps-muslim-ban-divides-excludes-people-972642", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-09T05:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T04:39:03.119+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
