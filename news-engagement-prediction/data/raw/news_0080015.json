GETTY Sturgeon is threatening another referendum which could hinder the UK's bargaining position with EU \nIn a Times column, Sturgeon said: “Since then, 62 per cent of all those in Scotland who cast a ballot in the EU referendum voted to remain. All bar one of our 59 MPs voted against the triggering of Article 50.“And yet, two years on from being told that rejecting independence would safeguard our EU membership, we face exit from the EU and from the single market and customs union.” \nSturgeon pointed to the Scottish parliament elections which took place less than a year ago.The SNP fought the campaign with a manifesto “to hold another referendum if a significant change in circumstances prevailed… like Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will.” Scotland Referendum Fri, September 19, 2014 More than 3.6m people turned out to vote in the Scottish independent referendum, resulting in a 'No' vote with 55.3%.Here we take a look at the public's reaction.

GETTY The SNP manifesto declared they would chase another referendum if the UK voted to leave Europe \nThe SNP leader claims: “The day after the EU referendum, I chose not to immediately exercise that mandate.“Instead, the Scottish government published a compromise position, which proposed a way for Scotland to remain in the single market. Instead of meeting us halfway, however, the UK Government’s approach has been ‘its way or no way’.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T09:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T06:13:27.181+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
