It is wrong. — ABC News 24, 16 February, 2017 Hello Im Paul Barry, welcome to Media Watch.And that was Nick Xenophon, pulling the fake news trigger last week, and brandishing a big red pen to strike out The Australians front page story by Simon Benson which made this damaging claim: Xenophons levy plan to hit families MEDICARE HIKE TO COST UP TO $2600 A YEAR —: The Australian, 16 February, 2017 So was Xenophon right to call that headline fake news?Well, the South Australian senator, who is blocking government welfare cuts, certainly has canvassed an increase in the Medicare levy. NICK XENOPHON: my personal view is I would rather see a small increase in the Medicare Levy, Medicare Surcharge, in the sense that I think that would be more equitable to fund the NDIS —: RN Breakfast, 14 February, 2017 But Xenophon has never said how much, and The Australian didnt bother to ask. So, would families really be paying up to $2600? No, says Xenophon, as he told The Australian after their front page attack, the maximum slug would be $600 and only middle-to-high income earners would pay.So, maybe not fake news but certainly wrong. And the Oz wasnt the only News Corp paper to take aim at him. So this one here. Its a beauty. This is more in the realm of silly news. —: ABC News 24, 16 February, 2017 Well, actually not news at all. Just a nasty ad hominem attack on the front page of the Telegraph where the news should be. NICK OFF The backwater Senator whos a threat to us all —: Daily Telegraph, 16 February, 2017 And the Teles chief political correspondent Sharri Markson was given carte blanche to insult both the man. a self-absorbed politician from a backwater town called Adelaide —: Daily Telegraph, 16 February, 2017 And the state he represents: a near-broke state that is draining its economically-sound neighbours dry and cannot even keep its lights on —: Daily Telegraph, 16 February, 2017 And inside the Tele there was yet more of the same: Mouth of the south is told to shut up —: Daily Telegraph, 16 February, 2017 EXCRUCIATING Self-promoting senator is stifling our economySelf-aggrandising senator Nick Xenophon, whose home state of South Australia has become an economic basket case, appears to be trying to do the same to the rest of the country. —: Daily Telegraph, 16 February, 2017 Now were all for freedom of speech but the news columns should not be given over to opinionated rants like that, designed to bully people the Tele doesnt agree with.Sadly, thats the way it is nowadays. And who says? Well, strident conservative columnists like Paul Sheehan and Miranda Devine for starters. PAUL SHEEHAN: This seems to be where the medias going where the measured middle seems to be sort of passe now, the impartial, cool, detached analytical coverage of events.MIRANDA DEVINE: Or what we were taught in journalism school?PAUL SHEEHAN: Basically thats gone, because now everybody is to be in a froth of outrage and opinion and you cant tell whats news and whats opinion anymoreMIRANDA DEVINE: And there was always meant to be a huge separation between opinion and news and clearly labelled opinion and news was supposed to be facts and you gave both sides and you tried to give the truth as best you could —: 2GB, Nights with Miranda Devine, 16 February, 2017 Wonderful isnt it?Miranda Devine is a star columnist on the Telegraph which had that very morning devoted so much of its news columns to those bullying attacks. And Paul Sheehans disregard for facts in this infamous columnhighlighted on Media Watch last yearsaw him suspended from the Herald, never to return. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T09:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:20:00.665+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
