After massive traffic jams across UAE yesterday, the day started on a lighter note with free-flowing vehicles on most roads. Hardly any traffic on roads today in comparison to last evening ??. The usual morning rush hour traffic on E11 Al Itihad Rd & #SMBZR from Shj - TrafficDXB (@trafficdxb) February 27, 2017 But you can expect traffic on the usual roads like Al Wahda street in Sharjah and the incoming traffic on Dubai-Sharjah road. Dubai is fairly not clogged this morning and you might experience slow moving traffic at World Trade Centre roundabout and areas around Al Safa street. The NCMS issued warning about fog formation and bad visibility this morning. So motorists are advised to practice caution while driving on streets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T15:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T08:10:02.450+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
