The last 6 digits will vary, and are determined by weight. \nListeria can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems, according to the FDA. Although healthy people may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, a Listeria monocytogenes infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths in pregnant women. \nThe company was notified about the problem by MDS Foods, a Meijer supplier that sources the Meijer branded cheeses from Deutsch Kase Haus, a cheese manufacturer based in Middlebury, Indiana. \nMeijer said to date there have been no known illnesses reported from the recalled products. \nAnyone who bought the cheese described above is urged not to eat it, but to throw it out or return it to the customer service desk at any Meijer store for a refund. \nCustomers with questions can call Meijer at 800-543-3704, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T02:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T08:37:12.163+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
