His name would be called, he would go up to shake the hand of then-Premier Greg Selinger and he would pose for a photo, Barber said.\nIt wasn't until Dave Barber stood up to receive the award that he realized it was for someone else. (Will The Real Dave Barber Please Stand Up )\nIt seemed like a clear process and a large honour but everything quickly changed.\n\"They say, 'Dave Barber, the director of global climate change, has won the Queen's Diamond Jubilee award,' and I shake my hand sideways and said, 'No! I am not that person',\" Barber said.\nIt became clear that the organizers had contacted the wrong Dave Barber to receive the medal.\nBarber said after a quick discussion, the organizers and Selinger decided to give him the medal anyway.\n\"I felt great but I didn't think the other Dave Barber would feel very good. But he is now vindicated because he is getting the Order of Canada,\" Barber said.\nArctic researcher, comedian among 6 Winnipeggers honoured with Order of Canada appointments Barber ended up making a short film called Will The Real Dave Barber Please Stand Up about the experience which he shared with the other Dave Barber, who got a \"good yuck about it,\" Barber said.\nWatching the Oscar blunder on Sunday, Barber said he felt for all of the people involved but thought, in those circumstances, the La La Land producers responded well.\n\"They were very classy about it. I thought they handled it really well,\" he said.\nWhile they may have handed over their awards to Moonlight , Barber wasn't quite so generous. He kept his Queen's Diamond Jubilee Medal.\n\"It's in my desk drawer,\" he said with a laugh.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T15:58:39.473+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
