'I cried on the day that I left [Chelsea] â€“ looking back, that probably should have told me I was making the wrong call, as I never cried when I left Blackburn, Newcastle or Fulham, or even when I retired. But it was my own decision.' Duff also told how he came close to joining Liverpool both and after his time at Chelsea.

'The first was a year or two before I signed for Chelsea [in 2003]. I would have gone there, but Blackburn wanted a big fee so not too many clubs could afford to buy me back then! 'Then when I was leaving Chelsea, the same move nearly happened again.' Duff retired in 2015 after a brief spell at Irish side Shamrock Rovers where he is now a first-team coach.
