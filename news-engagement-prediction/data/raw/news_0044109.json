Researchers at UCLA's Longevity Institute got groups of people to limit their calorie intake for one working week every month for three months. The diet, designed to mimic the results of a water-only fast, allowed for participants to consume between 750 and 1,100 calories per day. By the end of the trial, those who followed the 'fasting-mimicking diet' had lower blood pressure, more stable blood sugar, and better cholesterol levels than those who did not. People who followed the 'fasting-mimicking diet' in a recent trial had lower blood pressure, more stable blood sugar, and better cholesterol levels than those who did not WHAT IS 'THE FASTING-MIMICKING DIET'? In the UCLA trial, people on the 'fasting-mimicking diet' had food provided by the nutrition company L-Nutra. The diet stipulates that they limit calories to 750-1,100 for five days a month. During that time, they have a limited intake of carbohydrates and proteins, and a high amount of good fats. Their food packs would include energy bars, soups, a variety of snacks, drinks, and supplements. Their plant-based ingredients consist of fresh olives, vegetables, nuts, seeds, dark chocolate, and herbal teas. 'This study provides evidence that people can experience significant health benefits through a periodic, fasting-mimicking diet that is designed to act on the aging process,' said Dr Valter Longo. 'Prior studies have indicated a range of health benefits in mice, but this is the first randomized clinical trial with enough participants to demonstrate that the diet is feasible, effective and safe for humans.' Dr Longo, along with Dr Min Wei and colleagues, tested the effects of the fasting-mimicking diet on various risk factors for diabetes, heart disease, cancer or other conditions. One hundred people participated in the trial from April 2013 to July 2015. The participants, aged between 20 and 70 years old and all generally healthy, were divided into two groups. The first group, the control group, was told to continue their normal eating habits for three months. People in the second group were placed on a three-month test of the fasting-mimicking diet, with food supplied by the nutrition company L-Nutra during the fasting periods. The meals for the fast-mimicking diet contained precise proportions of proteins, fats and carbohydrates. After three months, participants in the control group were moved onto the special diet. The researchers found that participants on the fasting-mimicking diet lost an average of about 6lbs. Their waistlines shrank by up to two inches.
