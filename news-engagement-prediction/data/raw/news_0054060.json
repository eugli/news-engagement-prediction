Article continues below \nReddit is a kind source to plenty of FIFA 17 players, and one user has given his advice on how to score free-kicks when your opponent has a player on the line. \nWe've all done it. When you concede a free-kick online or even against the AI, you rush back to the goal line to prevent the inevitable worldie into the top bins. Article continues below \nWell now, you can sit on the other side of the fence and make sure nobody can do that to you. \nUser Pemoniz posted a video showing the technique that is simple to follow and easy to execute. \nHe wrote: \"Remember, if the opponents puts a player on the line, call a 2nd free kick taker and do a fake shot with him. The AI will get the defender off the line.\" \nAnd how do you do it? \n\"Fake shot (Shoot+pass)+ hold button you used to call the 2nd free kick taker.\" \nAnd it is as simple as that. As the video shows, once the first player steps over the free kick and runs into the box, the player on the line will automatically leave his post and move to mark the incoming player. Genius stuff. \nPlenty of Reddit users have been appreciative of the advice and it appears that it genuinely works, as if the video evidence wasn't enough. \nCarigma posted: \"I've never thought about this. This makes a lot of sense,\" while LeonTablet wrote: \"Omg this is brilliant, I didn't know this thanks a lot. Have some karma.\" \nWhile Rudejim - yes, you read correctly - went as far as to say: \"Genius! Just used this to score a 90' winner in my first game since reading this!\" \nThe days of your stunning free-kicks being thwarted on the line are over - so get scoring! \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
