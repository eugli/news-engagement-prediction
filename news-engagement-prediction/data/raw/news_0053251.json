From the moment guests stepped into the plaza outside the venue, they were transported to a Gucci world courtesy of graffiti by Coco Capitán. Inside, there were celebs aplenty and a truly out-of-this-world set. In the show notes, the brand dubbed the collection The Alchemist’s Garden, using the requisite philosophical terms and a symbol of the ouroboros to explain the themes of the lineup. If that seems confusing, we’re breaking down Alessandro Michele’s latest here.

After such guests as Tom Hiddleston, Soko, Florence Welch, A$AP Rocky, and Hari Nef arrived, a curtain was pulled back to reveal a central pyramid with a rooster weather vane atop it, surrounded by a glass-enclosed runway. Consider the set design bar raised. Photo: Yannis Vlamos / Indigital.tv The Sheer Magnitude of Sparkle By and away this was Michele’s glitteriest Gucci collection yet. There were sparkling glasses, tights, hoods, and jewelry, and outfits made of shimmering floral brocades. This season, you can really be your own disco ball.

One tank was emblazoned with the phrase Common sense is not that common. Photo: Yannis Vlamos / Indigital.tv The Anatomical and Intergalactic Prints Gucci’s garden of delights included prints that ranged from small insects to illustrations of outer space. In between were vibrant florals and plenty of logos, proving that in Michele’s vision, everything is Gucci.

The designer whipped up some surprising numbers, including giant silver septum piercings and shroud-like hoods in glittering fabrics. There were also several large parasols trimmed in fringe, for those looking for shade but not keen on hats.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:19:28.451+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
