Derick E. Hingle-USA TODAY Sports Ricardo Abreu could be facing a very lengthy ban. The UFC middleweight, already serving a doping suspension, failed another USADA drug test stemming from a Dec. 21 sample collection and is facing a second UFC anti-doping policy violation, the promotion announced Wednesday. Abreu is less than a year into a two-year ban by USADA due to testing positive for anabolic steroid metabolites norandrosterone and 19-noretiocholanolone in June 2016. He is currently ineligible to compete in the UFC until July 1, 2018. A second anti-doping violation could double Abreu’s suspension and the “aggravating circumstances” clause in the UFC anti-doping policy could lengthen the ban even more. The “aggravating circumstances” portion of the policy reads that an athlete can be sanctioned up to two more years if the violation was “intentional, the Anti-Doping Policy Violation had significant potential to enhance an Athlete’s Bout performance” and one of the following other factors: it was part of a “doping plan or scheme;” the athlete possessed multiple prohibited substances or methods or used a prohibited substance or method multiple times; or the athlete engaged in obstructive or deceptive conduct to avoid detection or adjudication. Abreu, 32, is now the second UFC fighter to face a second anti-doping policy violation since the promotion partnered with USADA in July 2015. George Sullivan failed a drug test while serving a one-year doping suspension last month. Abreu (5-1) has not fought since a split decision loss to Jake Collier in June 2015. The Ultimate Fighter Brazil alum won his UFC debut against Wagner Silva Gomes in May 2014.
