Incumbent Betsy Hodges followed with nearly $60,000. In St. Paul, Melvin Carter III has raised $152,370, giving him a significant financial head start over the other candidates vying to replace Mayor Chris Coleman.\nAbout 800 people from across the nation donated to Carter, a former St. Paul City Council member and   Minnesota Children’s Cabinet. The donors include prominent DFLers, from U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison to numerous state officials.\n“I’ve been a part of the national progressive movement for a really long time,” said Carter, who started fundraising in 2015, well before his competition, and included an extra month in his report filed Tuesday. “Everyone’s just getting started. So there’s a long road ahead.”\nIn Minneapolis, Frey’s haul, including donations from prominent DFLers and the firefighters’ union, leaves him with $177,627 cash on hand. His campaign got a boost Tuesday when the state Campaign Finance and Disclosure Board said he could use the money raised through his City Council campaign committee in his run for mayor.\n“We wanted to do this right and by the book, so I’m really glad there’s clarity in today’s decision,” Frey said.\nHodges, whose donors include people connect with the SEIU and Council Member Lisa Bender, has a balance of $41,170 in her campaign account after spending $30,000. She also still owes herself $21,500 on a loan she made to her campaign in 2013.\n“We’re running a grass roots campaign focused on engaging voters in every neighborhood of the city,” Hodges’ campaign manager Jorge Contreras said in a statement Tuesday. “I know that we’ll have the resources we need to engage every person in this city about their vision for the next four years.”\nOther Minneapolis mayoral candidates raised much less money. Civil rights activist Nekima Levy-Pounds raised about $6,000. State Rep. Ray Dehn, DFL-Minneapolis, raised about $6,000, though he noted that he didn’t announce his candidacy until the end of December.\n“I continue to raise money every day,” Dehn said, adding that his fundraising goal for the remainder of the campaign is $50,000 a month.\nTwo of the other candidates in the St. Paul mayor’s race also said they expect to ramp up their fundraising.\nPat Harris, another former St. Paul council member and senior vice president at BMO Harris Bank, started fundraising Dec. 6 and reported receiving $54,540 in 2016.\n“We feel pretty good about where we’re at. We’ve got a lot of support,” Harris said.\nCouncil Member Dai Thao, the most recent entrant into the St. Paul race, had not filed a report with the Ramsey County Elections Tuesday. But a prior report lists nearly $1,755 in contributions between Dec. 28 and Dec. 31. Unlike Frey, Thao said he does not plan to transfer the $28,755 balance from his council campaign committee to the mayor’s race.\n“The way for us to win is to work hard and get in front of the residents and talk to them. We’re not going to spend time trying to figure out how to move our money around,” Thao said.\nThe Ramsey County Elections Office had not received a January report, which sums up all 2016 donations and expenses, from Tom Goldstein Tuesday afternoon. Goldstein, who served on the St. Paul school board, previously reported having $3,014 in his coffers, which he loaned to his campaign in October.\nCampaign finance reports were also due Tuesday for City Council candidates in Minneapolis. Citywide, council incumbents tended to lead their challengers. Of those who’d filed reports, most had raised more than $20,000 in 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T01:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:10:02.100+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
