(Bill Kostroun/AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS  36 PM \nIn an alleged video of the moments after Darrelle Revis' altercation in Pittsburgh last Sunday, a man can be heard admitting to punching two individuals as part of an expletive-filled tirade. \nThe 11-second video, obtained by TMZ , shows two men lying on the sidewalk. They appear unconscious. The gossip website says a Pittsburgh Police Dept. representative confirmed the video was from the Revis incident. \n\"I knocked both of these motherf---ers out,\" the man in the video screams. \"Both of them. They both sleeping. Shut up before I knock your a-- out next. Both of y'all, shut up.\" \nThe words match up closely with what Revis was allegedly yelling after the Feb. 12 skirmish. \"Do you want to be next?\" Revis asked witness Nathan Watt, according to a police criminal complaint. \nJets doing their homework on how to recoup $6M if they cut Revis \nThe victims, Dallas Cousins and Zacheriah Jarvis, were unsure if Revis was the individual who threw the punches. Police say a man came to the aid of Revis, so it's possible he's the one talking in the video. \nRevis surrendered to police in Pittsburgh on Friday night. He's been charged with two counts of felony aggravated assault, one count of felony robbery, one count of felony conspiracy to commit aggravated assault, and one count of misdemeanor making terroristic threats. His next court date is Thursday. \nRevis' attorneys have painted the Jets star as a victim in the ordeal. They've also asked authorities to release the video footage referenced in last week's initial police statement. It's unclear if this TMZ clip is a part of that footage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T07:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T02:45:47.184+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
