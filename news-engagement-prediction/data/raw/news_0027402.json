If we can’t access public bathrooms, we can’t go to school, we can’t work, we can’t go to healthcare facilities ― this is about public accommodations and public accommodations are always key to civil rights. I can’t help but think about that moment from ‘Hidden Figures’ when Taraji P. Henson’s character has to walk 45 minutes to the bathroom ― Gavin had to go to a special ‘gender neutral’ bathroom, a nurses bathroom that was way out of the way.” \nCox was referring to Gavin Grimm, a 17-year-old who is at the heart of an upcoming SCOTUS case surrounding transgender rights and bathroom access ― the first time SCOTUS will hear a case about trans rights. \nIn 2016, Grimm fought against the Gloucester County School Board in Virginia for the right to use the public school bathroom that corresponds with his gender identity. Cox used her time on stage at the Grammy’s Sunday night to draw attention to Grimm and what has now become a SCOTUS case, slated to be heard on March 28. \nJames Michael Nichols is a queer writer and cultural critic whose work focuses heavily on the intersections of identity, art and politics.
