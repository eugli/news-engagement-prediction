And the prices are ridiculous.\nJust ask Sally Brown, who is getting married at a popular Sydney venue in October, exchanging vows in front of 400 guests.\n“Our top five expenses would have to be the reception, which is $81,000 for a food and basic alcohol package and no decorations included,” she says.\n“Then we have $24,500 on flowers, $7,500 for the videographer, $7,000 for the photographer and $15,000 for my dress.\n“We have about 420 people attending our wedding and our budget is $140,000.”\nAnd this is how you spend thousands and thousands on flowers.

Picture: Nightengaleswedding / Instagram Source: Supplied \n“Of course you can use the ordinary cutlery that the venue supply, but why would you do that when they offer you gold plated cutlery at an extra cost of ONLY $15 per person — bumping my spending by an extra $6300!”\nMARRIAGE OR MORTGAGE? \nThe bride-to-be said many couples get a loan, use their life savings or an early inheritance to fund their weddings.\n“The fact that people would be happy to put themselves into debt the size of half a mortgage for one day is truly sad.”\nKathy Apostolidis from Nightingales Wedding Designers told news.com.au that couples budgets had increased “substantially” in the last 12 months.\n“A lot of this is due to the extra inspiration that they have access to via social media which creates a desire for them to have these items for their day,” she said.\n“It’s hard to say an average spend as they are all vastly different, but say they start at $50,000 all the way up and up to high six figures.\n“They are looking for an exquisitely styled luxurious environment that is all their own — somewhere where the everyday is transcended to the highest level that they are able to achieve with their budget.”\nChandeliers surrounded by flowers and a cake bigger than a person, this is one of the weddings Sally was inspired by. Picture: Diane Koury Weddings and Events / Instagram Source: Supplied \nShe said the current trend was based on themes of “luxury”, with everything from personalised gifts to gold-rimmed glasses in hot demand.\n“Luxury is the key here, so any item that falls under this category, from a forest of florals and ceiling installations, multiple large chandeliers, bespoke tablescapes achieved with gold rimmed crystal glasses, luxury linens, candles, personalised gifts — to state of the art lighting effects and celebrity MC’s and entertainers.”\nTHE ‘EXTRAS’ \nPopular ‘add ons’ to receptions include a $15 signature cocktail on arrival, adding $2250 to your bill for 150 guests.\nSome venues charge up to $980 for a band to plug into their sound system — and fancy a backdrop for the bridal table? That will be $1400 thanks. Satin cloths on round tables instead of oval? That’s $60 per table.\nHere are some of the extravagant extras offered by Sydney venues:\nCharger plate, gold cutlery and napkin ring $15 per person\nChanging oval tables to round $30 per table\nChanging dance floor from parquetry to black or white $3,000\nCandelabras $50 per table\nBridal table backdrop $1400\nDance floor lighting $840\nBride and groom initials on dance floor $840\nRigging of Chandeliers $210 each\nColoured satin table clothes $30 per table\nDry ice $850\nProfessional MC $850\nProjector and screen $450\nDJ to plug into sound system $630\nBand to plug into sound system $980\nSignature Cocktail on arrival $15 pp\nGourmet antipasto platter per table $10 pp\nGelato cart $2200", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T16:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:47:45.352+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
