In Boston on Wednesday, over 50 people turned out to rail against the Trump administration, The Boston Globe reported.\nOne protester, however, argued that Thursday’s demonstrations took energy out of a lot of activists.\n“The immigration event yesterday was a big event, but not everyone can be at them all,” said Chicago resident Joe Balkis, a retired UPS worker.\nFollow Kerry on Twitter", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T05:19:38.941+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
