listening session with manufacturing CEOs in the State Dining Room of the White House on February 23, 2017. Win McNamee/Getty Images \nPresident Donald Trump held the largest yet of his meetings with high-powered executives on Thursday, assembling 24 CEOs in the White House's State Dining Room to discuss American manufacturing. \nJoined by members of his cabinet and several of his top aides, Trump told the executives that he would bring \"many millions\" of jobs back to the United States and said that he would be addressing the $60 billion trade deficit with Mexico. He said that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is on a \"tough trip\" in Mexico. \nAfter the group discussion, attendees split into four breakout sessions run by administration officials: tax and trade, regulatory reform, infrastructure, and the workforce of the future. \n\"The U.S. economy lost 6 million manufacturing jobs from 2000 to 2010, roughly one-third of its total, in part due to offshoring, but the sector has added 900,000 jobs since then,\" Reuters reported , citing the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. \nTrump has held several meetings with corporate executives in his first weeks as president , and Thursday's included recurring guests like Ford CEO Mark Fields, Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson, and Dow Chemical CEO Andrew Liveris. The manufacturing council was announced late last month, and was assembled with the help of Liveris. \nHere's who had a seat at the table this time. Jeff Immelt — Chairman and CEO of General Electric Justin Sullivan/Getty Images \nIn the second half of President Barack Obama's administration, the Tea Party wing of the Republican Party in Congress pushed hard against the Export-Import Bank , which provides loans for subsidizing manufacturing exports. \nGE was unhappy with this development , moving 350 jobs in Wisconsin, 225 in Texas, and 180 in Ohio to Canada, France, the United Kingdom, and Hungary. \nAt the start of the meeting Thursday, Trump had Immelt tell the story of how Trump hit a hole in one when they golfed together, and that the president was \"the best golfer of all the rich people.\" Kenneth Frazier — Chairman and CEO of Merck Lucas Jackson/Reuters \nFrazier told CNBC in December that he was open to seeing the Trump administration overhaul the Affordable Care Act, and that they needed to prioritize health care spending. \nHe warned, however, against Trump's flirting with the idea of the reimportation of drugs, which had a degree of bipartisan support in 2008 but then fizzled out. Michael Dell — Founder, chairman, and CEO of Dell Technologies REUTERS/Lucas Jackson \nDell was also a member of Trump's first business meeting as president. \n\"What we see is a new administration that's talking about growth,\" Dell told Bloomberg at this year's World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"I think you'll see our company, companies like ours, across all industries, bring capital back onto the balance sheet of the United States, which is likely to be a good thing, and so we're very supportive of that.\" Inge Thulin — Chairman, president, and CEO of 3M \nReuters reported that 3M says it added more than 2,000 American manufacturing jobs in the last five years, but is also moving 130 jobs in Cincinatti to Mexico. Marillyn Hewson — Chairwoman, president, and CEO of Lockheed Martin Kevin Lamarque/Reuters \nTrump called out Lockheed Martin on Twitter in December for what he said was excessive spending on the development of the advanced fighter jet, the F-35. Hewson then met with Trump to discuss. \nIn a statement after their meeting , she said that she promised Trump she would aggressively cut costs on the F-35, and in February Lockheed Martin announced it was enacting $700 million in cost-cutting on the fighter jet project. \n\"You think [Hillary Clinton] would have asked for $700 million?\" Trump joked on Thursday. \"Oh boy, I assume you wanted her to win. But you're going to do great, and you're going to make more planes.\" Mark Fields — President and CEO of Ford Motor Company Rebecca Cook/Reuters \nFields has interacted with the president regularly since his election. \nIn January, Fields announced that Ford would not pursue a proposed $1.6 billion production facility in Mexico that Trump had criticized during his campaign. Fields clarified that the move was because of the market and not Trump's remarks, but he also said , \"We are encouraged by the pro-growth plans that President-elect Trump and the new Congress indicate they will pursue.\" \nFord plans to invest $4.5 billion in electric and self-driving vehicles over the next five years. Alex Gorsky — CEO of Johnson & Johnson Jonathan Ernst/Reuters \nAs the head of Johnson & Johnson — the giant producer of medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products — Gorsky can benefit from a positive relationship with Trump, who has said he would get drug companies to lower prices. \nGorsky told CNBC in January that he met with Trump before his inauguration to discuss healthcare policy. \n\"And the kinds of things we're talking about is how can we take what I believe is one of the very best healthcare systems in the world and how can we make it even better?\" he said. \"How can we make changes, recognizing the challenges, economic pressures, regulatory pressures, but keep essential elements like innovation through better integration?\" Jeff Fettig — Chairman and CEO of Whirlpool Jamie Fine/Reuters \n\"Mad Money\" host Jim Cramer told his audience that Whirlpool, the home appliance manufacturer, was a great example of a \"Trump stock.\" \nIt's the only manufacturer of its kind left in the US, Cramer said, and it would benefit from protectionist policies that could harm its South Korean rivals, Samsung and LG. Mark Sutton — Chairman and CEO of International Paper International Paper \nInternational Paper, based in Memphis, Tennessee, has 65,000 employees, making it the largest pulp-and-paper company in the world. \nIn December, it finalized its $2.2 billion acquisition of the cellulose fiber portion of Weyerhaeuser, one of the world's largest owners of timberlands. David Farr — Chairman and CEO of Emerson Electric Brendan McDermid/Reuters \nFarr, chairman of the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) said at a NAM event in February , that \"we have a chance to work together and redefine how our country sees and supports manufacturing. ... We can rekindle a feeling of achievement among our people and reignite the power manufacturing has to improve our world.\" Bill Brown — Chairman, president, and CEO of Harris Corporation \nFlorida-based Harris Corp. has 21,000 employees and is a notable US military contractor. Denise Morrison — President and CEO of Campbell Soup Company Courtesy of Campbell Soup Company \n\"I think there is an optimism about reducing taxes and regulation reform,\" Morrison told CNBC in January . \"I think that anything that will give the consumer some relief, at least, will be good for our business and good for the country.\" \nAt the meeting on Thursday, Trump told Morrison he was a fan of Campbell's soups. Doug Oberhelman — Chairman and former CEO of Caterpillar Inc. Reuters \nCaterpillar, the giant machinery manufacturer, has a gloomy outlook for 2017 . \nReuters reported it is moving 712 jobs in the South and Midwest to Mexico, China, France and Germany, but is adding 1,300 American jobs in different parts of the US. Wendell Weeks — Chairman and CEO of Corning Corning Locked/YouTube \nCorning, the multibillion-dollar glass-and-ceramics manufacturer based in Corning, New York, is one of the largest employers of people living along the \"Twin Tiers\" New York-Pennsylvania border. \nAs The Star-Gazette reported , Corning was reluctant to repatriate $3.2 billion of overseas profits, to avoid a 35% tax. But under Trump, Weeks could bring money back to its US operations at a significantly reduced cost. John Ferriola — Chairman, president, and CEO of Nucor Corporation CNBC/YouTube \nNucor is the largest steel producer in the US. \nIn an earnings call in January , Ferriola said he was encouraged by a Trump cabinet that was \" very knowledgeable about the steel industry and very knowledgeable about trade laws and policy,\" but noted that he may have to reconsider the future of the $270 million plant in Mexico Nucor has planned. Mario Longhi — CEO of US Steel Lucas Jackson/Reuters \nLonghi told CNBC in December that he was hopeful Trump could bring as many as 10,000 jobs back to the American steel industry and that he's looking forward to loosened regulations under the administration, since he said they were hampering his business. \nAt the meeting on Thursday, Trump told Longhi that US Steel would now \"be doing pipelines,\" a reference to the executive order Trump signed last month that stated the Keystone and Dakota Access oil pipelines would have to be made from American steel. The unresolved problem there is that much of the Keystone piping has already been manufactured, and it's not American.
