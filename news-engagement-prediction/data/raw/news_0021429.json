That is a legitimate demand that has been largely satisfied by a bipartisan consensus over the past 30 years, most recently by the inclusion of members of Congress in the rules of the Affordable Care Act, following the vote in the ’80s to scale back an overly generous congressional pension system as well as putting members into the Social Security system on the same terms as every other citizen. Special legal privilege for representatives and senators exists today only on those parts of the Internet where alternative facts govern — with one exception.\nThanks to a provision of the Constitution inserted to prevent a repetition of the attacks on parliamentarians by Queen Elizabeth and Kings James and Charles, members of Congress may falsely accuse almost anyone in the world of the most despicable behavior without being sued for libel or slander — even if the victims can show that the falsehood was deliberate and financially damaging and that they would have been able to collect significant damages from any nonmember who said the same thing.\nGet This Week in Opinion in your inbox: Globe Opinion's must-reads, delivered to you every Sunday.

As the McConnell gag order demonstrated, thanks to the Senate rule, while senators may tell outrageous lies about any nonsenator who is wholly innocent of the accusation in question, they may not say anything that reflects badly on the character of another senator, even if it is indisputably true. (The House has a similar rule.)\nThis explains why there was no restriction on Coretta King’s letter during the confirmation hearing in 1986. It was only when Sessions became a senator that he was shielded from accurate characterizations of his past behavior. While the rule should be abolished, it is very rarely applied. In fact, there is a subspecies of congressional oratory in which members show their skill in defying its spirit. My favorite example is Representative John McCormack, a great debater in his pre-speakership days, who commandeered a trite formula to refer to a racist Democrat as “the gentleman whom I hold in minimum high regard.”\nThis very history of the rule being honored far more in the breach than the observance underlines the Republicans’ willingness to use special privilege for officialdom when it suits a partisan purpose.\nAdvertisement\nThe second inconsistency between conservative doctrine and practice here is the contrast between protecting Jeff Sessions from full discussion of his past official actions on the grounds that the need for civility must constrain debate if the Senate is to function well and the insistence that no such consideration is at all appropriate on college campuses.\nSubstantively, I agree with those who insist on the right of both faculty and students to engage in untrammeled discussion of all topics in the academic context. I believe universities should discipline those who seek physically to prevent speakers with whom they disagree from being heard. What I cannot understand is how those who believe as I do that it is a mistake to shield college students from views which they find disturbing can simultaneously insist on sheltering a US senator from being discomfited by the reading of a letter in his presence critical of his official actions in a debate about whether he should be given great power in that same area of activity. By what criterion do the sensibilities a 60-year-old politician need more protection than those of an 18-year-old away from home for the first time?\nAnd the justification that Senator Warren had some other platforms for her statements is even less persuasive than saying that it is OK for a student audience to shout down a speaker because she could find an off-campus forum. There is no platform equal to being able to speak for the record on the Senate floor.\nBarney Frank, a former US representative from Massachusetts, is the author of “Frank.”", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fopinion%2F2017%2F02%2F09%2Fthe-gop-hypocrisy-shutting-elizabeth-warren%2FhDqgR2pJjryLPMmvVpMzkK%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&t=The", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fopinion%2F2017%2F02%2F09%2Fthe-gop-hypocrisy-shutting-elizabeth-warren%2FhDqgR2pJjryLPMmvVpMzkK%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%26s_campaign%3dsm_gp%26hl=en-US", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fopinion%2F2017%2F02%2F09%2Fthe-gop-hypocrisy-shutting-elizabeth-warren%2FhDqgR2pJjryLPMmvVpMzkK%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&title=The", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fopinion%2F2017%2F02%2F09%2Fthe-gop-hypocrisy-shutting-elizabeth-warren%2FhDqgR2pJjryLPMmvVpMzkK%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%3Fevent%3Devent25&tThe"], "published": "2017-02-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T03:44:36.811+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
