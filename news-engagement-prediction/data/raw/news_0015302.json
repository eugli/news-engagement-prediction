For now Josh Dugan looks to be the preferred option at fullback but it won’t take much for McGregor to rethink and switch Dugan into the centres for this star of the future. \nJai Field (Dragons) Field's try of the tournament 0:39 \nThis kid has got something the Dragons desperately need: Attacking spark. Despite playing in a losing side at the Nines, Field was everything that was good about their day one efforts, scoring three tries, with one of them a contender for try of the tournament and another coming from a searing break that came from nothing. Paul McGregor could do a lot worse than give the 19-year-old the No.7 jersey in round one, even if he is a bit slight. \nBrian Kelly (Manly) \nHe’s got class written all over him. Was integral in Manly’s comeback against the Eel and has playmaking ability on top of being a deadly finisher. The humble teenager wasn’t keen to talk himself up to foxsports.com.au but he’s a huge chance of slipping into Steve Matai’s left centre role, if the Manly champion can’t get himself on the field in 2017. \nJaydn Su’A (Broncos) \nVying for the jersey vacated by Corey Parker, Su’A got his 2017 off to a terrific start, playing plenty of minutes and creating plenty of headaches for opposition defences as the Broncos dominated day one. Whether or not he secures a starting jersey, Su’A will see a good amount of time in the top grade in 2017. \nNick Cotric (Raiders) Aaron Gray of the Rabbitohs is up-ended by Nick Cotric of the Raiders.   \nHaving just turned 18, this Canberra prodigy showed why he’s touted to be the next big thing with an outstanding day one of competition, highlighted by his impossible escape from the in goal area when he looked all but trapped. Still, the Raiders didn’t overexpose him to the next level, with the coaching staff sitting him out of their day two loss to the Roosters. \nBrodie Croft (Storm) \nAs a young half, who wouldn’t want to go and learn the craft off Cooper Cronk and this kid’s sensational tournament is already making his decision to sign with the Storm look like an outstanding one. At just 19, the cool as a cucumber No.7 pulled the strings all weekend for the surprise semi-finalists, scoring and setting nup tries consistently to get a deserved nod in the team of the tournament. \nKalyn Ponga (Cowboys) Ponga excites Knights fans 0:45 \nHad the Cowboys progressed to the final, as most expected after day one of competition, this kid was going to be tough to stop for player of the tournament. Not only does he score tries, he sets them up with incredible footwork and footballing instincts that always seems to suck an extra number in. The Knights have got a ripper for 2018. \nGideon Mosby-Gela (Cowboys) \nThrow him a jersey at just about any club other than the Cowboys and this speed demon would be a walk up start and probably score 20 tries in the season. His defensive abilities might not be quite up to NRL standard but when it comes to finishing, he’s stone cold as he showed with five outstanding tries for the competition. \nBrock Lamb (Knights) Brock Lamb attempts to make a tackle.   \nNewcastle may have plenty of challenges ahead in 2017 but this kid looks likely to emerge as the silver lining. In a young team, the 20-year-old was the standout on both days and is leading the charge to fill the No.6 jersey vacated by Jarrod Mullen, who looks set to have his career ended by a drug ban. \nJamal Fogarty (Eels) \nThis 23-year-old has dominated Queensland Cup for several years and is finally on the verge of a breakthrough into the top grade after taking up a deal with the Eels. Clinton Gutherson is in the box seat for first crack at the No.6 jersey but Fogarty showed throughout the Nines that he also has legitimate claims for a starting role. \nBernard Lewis (Roosters) Cronk's cracking reaction 0:59 \nYou couldn’t miss this 19-year-old winger with a shock of bleached blonde hair if you tried and he made an unforgettable entrance for mainstream audiences with tries in the semi-final and final to play a big role in winning the trophy for his team. Looks a chance of making his NRL debut in 2017. \nChris Smith (Roosters) \nAsk anyone who’s watched Roosters training in the off-season and they’ll tell you this 23-year-old at his second NRL club has been on fire. After debuting for the Panthers in 2015, Smith played his second first grade game for the Roosters last year. If he can keep up his form from the Nines it won’t be long before he gets game number three. \nJed Cartwright (Panthers) \nIt’s a name that’s synonymous with the Panthers and the latest Cartwright off the production line looks set to continue the proud family tradition. Threw an outrageous offload to set up a try on day two and just that one moment will be enough to have him fielding comparisons to his father John and his cousin Bryce. \nDylan Edwards (Panthers) Mitchell Aubusson of the Roosters tackled by Dylan Edwards of the Panthers. Source: News Corp Australia \nAfter coming through the youth ranks with Nathan Cleary this talented fullback has seen how quickly the step up to NRL level can be taken and he told foxsports.com.au he was eager to be the next young Panther to make the jump. The 21-year-old is best known for his lethal try-scoring strike rate but he showed there’s more to his game with an awesome try saving tackle to deny a rampaging Leivaha Pulu in Penrith’s crucial pool clash with the Titans. \nAta Hingano (Warriors) \nThis youngster is all class and if Shaun Johnson’s injury issues continue he’ll be first cab off the rank to pull on the No.7 jersey. The Warriors surprisingly went winless, limping out of the competition in the pool stages, but Hingano’s touches stood out and he bagged a try in their disappointing loss to the Dragons. \nQueensland NRL fans, get excited.
