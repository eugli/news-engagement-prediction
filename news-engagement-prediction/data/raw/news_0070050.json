IndiaToday.in | Posted by Mini Dixit A + A - Picture courtesy: Instagram/Emma Hulse \nWhat seems like a case of blatant workplace sexism at the first glance, 24-year-old Emma Hulse claims she was sacked from her job for being 'too attractive'. \nAs per Hulse, her 8-hour freelance shift at production firm, UNIT TV, was abruptly terminated merely five minutes after she turned up for work. Picture courtesy: Instagram/Emma Hulse \nHulse's line manager at the London-based production house reportedly asked her if she \"was a model\" and why she was \"not doing catwalks.\" \nAlso Read: Yes, covert sexism in the workplace hampers a woman's self-esteem \n\"..my agent texts me that I'm no longer required. I got there and spoke to the line manager and he asked me, 'are you a model? Are you not doing catwalks, why are you not at the front of house?',\" the Mirror UK quotes Hulse as saying. \nAdding, she said, \"I was wearing a lipstick but from my perspective I was not inappropriate. I was wearing a shirt and trousers. I really didn't think I looked inappropriate.\" Picture courtesy: Instagram/Emma Hulse \nHulse also alleged that the manager subsequently offered to go out for drinks besides asking for her private number. She speculated that she might've been \"a distraction\" in a company that \"employs plain looking people.\" \nWhile her employers have confirmed Hulse's expulsion, the owner of the company, Adam Luckwell maintains she was fired after three months of probation. \n\"We felt she was a bad fit for us and some of the things she was doing was not in line with the company's policy,\" Luckwell was quoted as telling Mirror UK.
