(credit: istock) \nANN ARBOR (WWJ) – The FBI has joined the investigation into an alleged hate crime at the University of Michigan. \nEarlier this week, two U-M students claim they saw three men urinate on Muslim prayer rugs in a “reflection room” at the Shapiro Undergraduate Library on the Ann Arbor campus. \nThe school has several reflection rooms used by people of various religions for prayer. \nOfficials with Muslim civil liberties and advocacy organization CAIR (the Council on American-Islamic Relations) are asking for tips in the case. \n“Students on our university campuses should feel safe to express their faiths without fear of intimidation or harassment,” said CAIR-MI Executive Director Dawud Walid, in a statement. “We encourage anyone who has knowledge of this incident to immediately contact law enforcement authorities.” \nSeparately this week, U-M discovered racist and anti-Semitic and anti-African-American emails touting ethnic extermination, with the slogan “Heil Trump!”, were sent to students on campus. \nOfficials said the messages were s falsely attributed to an engineering professor and one of his students. An investigation into that incident is also ongoing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T03:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:08:57.220+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
