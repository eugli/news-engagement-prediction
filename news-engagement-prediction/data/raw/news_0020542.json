Gabrielle Knowles, Chief Crime Reporter - 7News on February 8, 2017, 9:47 am Share Haunting question: Did the Birnies kill my mother Cheryl Renwick? - Yahoo7 The daughter of a woman missing for 30 years says she believes her mother may have been murdered by notorious serial killers David and Catherine Birnie. Close Behind the Birnies: escaping WA's worst serial killers UP NEXT VIDEO Behind the Birnies: escaping WA's worst serial killers. Source: 7 News Behind the Birnies: escaping WA's worst serial killers \nMichelle Renwick was just 14 when her mother Cheryl Renwick vanished without a trace in May 1986, less than six months before the Birnies were arrested for abducting and killing four women. \nMurder Uncovered premieres tonight at 9pm on Seven and PLUS7 Live \nMs Renwick said she still clearly remembered her then 33-year-old mum being terrified in the months before her disappearance that a man and woman were stalking her. Cheryl Renwick \nCheryl Renwick’s car was found abandoned at Perth Airport the week she disappeared but police found no sign the single mother of two had travelled by plane or bus and her bank accounts remained untouched. \nWhile there was never any evidence to link the case to the Birnies, Ms Renwick has publicly revealed for the first time in Seven’s new crime investigation series Murder Uncovered, which airs tonight, that she believes the couple were involved. \n“Yeah, I do think it’s David and Catherine Birnie,” she said. Catherine Birnie \nWhen the Birnies were arrested in November 1986 after their final victim Kate Moir managed to escape alive, police investigated the theory that they might have had other victims. \nThey even asked then 14-year-old Ms Renwick and her younger sister to go to a police station to sift through a pile of clothing, jewellery and make-up belonging to victims of the Birnies to check if they recognised anything of their mother’s. \nMs Renwick said police had since told her they no longer believed the cases were linked because it did not fit the Birnies’ “MO”. \nHowever, Ms Renwick believes there are “too many coincidences” between her mother’s disappearance and the couple’s monstrous crimes and says the unanswered questions continue to haunt her. \nShe hopes Catherine Birnie will reveal if the couple did kill her mother. David Birnie \n“I’d just like to know if they did it,” she said. \n“I just want closure. \n“I would like justice to be served, but I would actually just like to know what happened so we could actually find her and bury her.” \nDavid Birnie led police to the graves of four women — Mary Neilson, Susannah Candy, Noelene Patterson and Denise Brown — he and his lover abducted, raped and killed between October 11 and November 10, 1986. Kate Moir \nHe did not confess to any more crimes before taking his own life in prison in 2005 but Murder Uncovered explores the Birnies’ links to other unsolved murders. \nWA Police have refused to comment on specific cases. \nIn a statement yesterday, a police spokesman said only that the special crime squad continued to investigate long-term unsolved homicides and missing person cases.
