And we're curious to see if he'll take time away from his golf schedule to live-tweet this year's show on Sunday night. \nTo see the kind of bon mots he may drop as POTUS, see some of the best tweets he wrote as a private citizen over the past few years (below)! \nDjango Unchained is the most racist movie I have ever seen, it sucked! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2013 \nThe crowd pleaser about a slave getting free and revolting. So racist. SMH. \nI'm having a real hard time watching the Academy Awards (so far). The last song was terrible! Kim should sue her plastic surgeon! #Oscars — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 3, 2014 \nThat's in reference to 81-year-old Kim Novak btw. Classy. \nDo you believe this singing? #Oscars — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 3, 2014 \nWas he talking about Pharrell doing Happy ? Idina Menzel performing Let It Go ? \nI don't know how much longer I can take this bullshit - so terrible! #Oscars — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 3, 2014 \nHe apparently wasn't a fan of any of the singers as he even went after Bette Midler performing Wind Beneath My Wings during the In Memoriam, writing: \nThey should have allowed applause during the TRIBUTE to the departed - Really bad production. Bette Midler sucked! #Oscars — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 3, 2014 \nThis is Amateur Night - who the hell is in charge of this production? #Oscars — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 3, 2014 \nWas President Obama in charge of this years Academy Awards - they remind me of the ObamaCare website! #Oscars . — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 3, 2014 \nWow. He really didn't know the scope of the President's duties. Ha! \nEllen was so awkward and insecure last night. The pizza skit was terrible. She should dump Andy Lassner, a guy with no absolutely no talent! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 3, 2014 \nHe does know Ellen DeGeneres ' whole standup persona was all about insecurity, right? Too subtle for Dumb Donald? \nOf course, the REAL sentiment was buried in the middle of all that. \nI should host the #Oscars just to shake things up - this is not good! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 3, 2014 \nYep. There it is. All about him all the time. \nExcept when it's about attacking other countries… \nThe Oscars were a great night for Mexico & why not—they are ripping off the US more than almost any other nation. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 24, 2015 \nWorst graphics and stage backdrop ever at the Oscars. Show is terrible, really BORING! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 23, 2015 \nLest we forget this whole running for president thing started off as a spiteful move because Trump hated Barack Obama so much… \nThe Oscars are a sad joke, very much like our President. So many things are wrong! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 23, 2015 \nThen because Trump can't separate money from quality… \nI told you the Oscars were terrible—bad look, bad talent—and among the lowest ratings in show’s history. http://t.co/AOc5aQdVvk … — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 23, 2015 \nPut the glamour, beauty & mystery back in the Oscars and the ratings will zoom. Also, & most importantly, the Oscars need credibility. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 24, 2015 \nNo, the Oscars need to cut the bad comedy bits so they don't have to play every single honoree off with music. \nPRESIDENTS need credibility. \nTune in to the Oscars on Sunday, February 26 at 7 p.m. EST on ABC and see all of our coverage — including whatever President Pompous has to say — RIGHT HERE! \n[ Image via Dennis Van Tine/Future Image/ WENN . ] A History Of Hollywood Whitewashing!
