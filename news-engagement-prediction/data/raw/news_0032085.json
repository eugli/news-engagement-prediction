Rec The dogs participating in the 2017 Westminster Dog Show are the best of the best. To reach that level of success, you might think the dogs are on highly-regimented diets. Some might be, others probably eat healthy most of the time, but also enjoy some delicious snacks. Like Duffy, who loves to snack on pizza. This dog's name is Duffy and he likes Pizza. pic.twitter.com/UsUFVrBnrw — SB Nation GIF (@SBNationGIF) February 14, 2017 Same, Duffy. Same. This very good dog enjoys chicken and waffles. THIS DOG EATS CHICKEN AND WAFFLES pic.twitter.com/3aTDs1CF03 — SB Nation GIF (@SBNationGIF) February 14, 2017 Who doesn’t like some beef jerky? UNHAND ME SIR OR MY FAVORITE SNACK WILL BE YOU HAND pic.twitter.com/4uFpQkls0q — SB Nation GIF (@SBNationGIF) February 14, 2017 This very, very floppy dog loves to snack on Cheetos. You can almost see it thinking about Cheetos as it runs through the course. WOBBLE WOBBLE WOBBLE WOBBLE pic.twitter.com/JRlXsgeDkj — SB Nation GIF (@SBNationGIF) February 14, 2017 This dog snacks on filet mignon, which means it certainly snacks much better than I do. Life goals. This dog eats better than you pic.twitter.com/4eUPtUaA71 — SB Nation GIF (@SBNationGIF) February 14, 2017 Other dogs have some more unique tastes. Minion prefers to snack on some venison. This dog eats deer for a snack. This dog eats DEER pic.twitter.com/SUfAsavXCx — SB Nation GIF (@SBNationGIF) February 14, 2017 Good snacks for even better dogs.
