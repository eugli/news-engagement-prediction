Even if he didn't show that to his victims,\" he said, adding that some of his own clients have also been attacked at the jail and at other facilities.\nHe also blasted those on social media who cheered on the attack.\n“If there's members of the public who think, yeah, that's good, I'm glad this happened, or whatever they may think about it, they are absolutely, totally wrong,\" Der said in an interview Sunday.\n\"It's not what we should ever expect should happen in a Canadian jail.\"\nGarland was sentenced to 75 years in jail without parole on Friday afternoon in connection with the 2014 murders.\nOn Monday, he is expected to return to the jail but Ross says Garland could elect to sign a waiver to be transferred from the Calgary Remand Centre to prison during the timeframe when an appeal could be initated but he does not foresee his client requesting relocation.\nFurther details about the attack on Garland will be released once the responsible parties have been charged.\n(With files from The Canadian Press) \nRelated Stories Douglas Garland hospitalized following attack at remand centre", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T16:19:29.792+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
