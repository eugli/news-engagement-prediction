Don't freak out. He's a bit of a rogue choice, but... \nPeter Dutton? Why not send a Valentine to Immigration Minister Peter Dutton? Photo: Alex Ellinghausen \nHear us out. \nThe Women's March on Sydney are calling for women to send their February 14 wishes to the federal Immigration and Border Protection Minister, to demand an end to offshore detention. Related Content Women's March organises second day of action \nThe call comes as part of a global initiative from the people behind the Women's March on Washington, who have named Valentine's Day 2017 a \"Day of Revolutionary Love\". Make February 14th a day of #RevolutionaryLove and resistance! Join us Tuesday 6-9pm in Washington Square Park, NYC. https://t.co/P6TmTToNhG pic.twitter.com/CSoybkT2ID â€” Women's March (@womensmarch) February 13, 2017 Advertisement \nWhile the movement's US branch will be demonstrating at Washington Square Park in New York, the Sydney organisers have decided to follow the lead of the Women's March on London with a mass card-sending campaign to those who control national immigration policy. \n\"Today we join with our sisters across the globe to call for a more compassionate response to the international refugee crisis,\" the group announced in a statement on their Facebook page . Photo gallery Thousands of protesters hit the streets for Women's March in Australia \nThe London action is in response to a decision of the Theresa May government to end the country's Child Migrant Scheme, which allows for the safe passage of unaccompanied refugee children into the UK. \n\"In Australia, our offshore detention camps continue to be a blight on our collective humanity,\" Women's March Sydney co-founder Kate Taylor told Fairfax Media. \"This Valentine's Day we're asking Peter Dutton MP to have a heart, close the camps and bring those seeking refuge into Australia.\" \nThe suggested message for your letter to Dutton is: \"This Valentine's Day, we celebrate the love that expresses our shared humanity and compassion. We ask that you put that love into practise to defend those who need us most. End offshore detention and #bringthemhere.\" \nThe group have designed eight printable cards which can be posted, emailed, or even tweeted to Dutton. The cards are available on their Facebook page . \nThe action is being supported by the Women's March Melbourne and Canberra groups. The Women's March: what comes next? \nThe Women's March, held on January 21, was a global, and peaceful, protest movement for gender equality, held the day after the inauguration of US President Donald Trump. \nOriginally planned as a March on Washington, the movement grew to include more than 600 marches taking place on all seven continents. In Australia, events were held in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. \nMore than 10,000 people participated in the Sydney march, which saw attendees walk from Hyde Park to Martin Place. \nLast week, the original Washington branch of the movement announced they would be organising a second day of action: a \"day without a woman\" strike to be held on March 8, International Women's Day. \nHowever, Women's March Global told Fairfax Media this event is only being organised by the group's US branch, saying that, although they acknowledge \"the financial impact that women have on our economies both in the workforce and through buying power\", there were no plans for a global strike. \nInstead, the global movement will be engaging in a week of action from March 6 to March 11, which will honour the \"autonomy\" of the global groups in \"organising their own events and initiatives\". \nAs for the Sydney branch, Taylor says that, although there will not be an Australian strike, January's march was \"only the beginning\". \n\"Since January 21 our organising team has grown from 25 to over 70 women who are actively volunteering on projects to advance equality for women and all marginalised people. The women of Sydney are rising to the challenge.\" Related Content", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T10:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T05:33:14.440+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
