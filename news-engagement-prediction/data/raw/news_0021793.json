News Group Newspapers Ltd 10 Ronaldo Vieira has made a name for himself at Leeds United this season \nBorn in Guinea-Bissau, raised in Portugal and now settled in England, his next destination looks set to be the Premier League. \nKeep up to date with ALL the Leeds United gossip and transfers on our club page plus fixtures, results and live match commentary \nAnd fans across the country will certainly take note should they see his name on a top-flight teamsheet. \nNot least if he is joined on it by his twin brother — a fellow Leeds midfielder, who is called Romario! \nRonaldo — known as ‘Ronny’ — smiled: “My mum Regina played football herself. \n“So because we were born a week after Brazil played France in the 1998 World Cup final, I think she just decided, ‘This one is Ronaldo and that one is Romario’. \n“At school, people were just amazed we had these names, with Vieira as a surname. \n“They were just thinking, ‘What is this? They must be making it up.’ \n“A lot of the media attention me and my brother got when we started must have been because of our names. \n“But I don’t look at it like a burden. \n“I have watched a few clips of Vieira on YouTube to get to know what he was about.

He’s got a bright future that boy.” \nBut his feet are firmly on the ground.

That was a tough time.” Getty Images Vieira has been a shining light for the Whites who are chasing promotion Reuters The teen showed courage netting the winning penalty in a shootout against Norwich \nIt was in Portugal that Vieira started playing football at a local club. \nAnd his natural talent was soon spotted by Benfica, who moved him to Lisbon from his Algarve home when he was 12 — the only time he has been away from his twin. \nThat, though, lasted just a year as the Eurozone crisis meant his mum and stepdad were struggling for work. \nSo they uprooted to England, shortly after returning from a summer holiday in Newcastle, where Ronaldo scored a hatful in a tournament for Whitley Bay. \nThey settled in Batley, East Yorkshire, and the boys had trials at Manchester City and Leeds, albeit unsuccessfully. News Group Newspapers Ltd Vieira started playing football in Portugal News Group Newspapers Ltd 10 Vieira spoke about a difficult upbringing and has lived in three countries \nIt was not until they were studying at York College and playing at its i2i Academy that they won a second chance at Elland Road. \nRonaldo eventually joined Leeds aged 17, and was handed his first-team debut as a late sub at Preston in the final game of last season. \nRomario signed 12 months after his brother, and is still part of the Under-23 set-up. \nRonaldo, who has made 26 appearances under Garry Monk this term, said: “It’s good to know the manager is not scared of playing young players if he thinks we are capable. \n“He has put a lot of confidence into us and we want to repay him.” 10 Garry Monk has put faith in Vieira throughout this season \nVieira confesses he did not support Leeds before he signed for them, whispering “Chelsea” when asked who his English team used to be. \nBut he knows just how much it would mean to get the fallen Yorkshire giants back in the big time after 13 long years. \nVieira said: “It would feel brilliant, and not just for me and not just for Leeds fans. \n“Fans of the Premier League want Leeds back there. So we will try and do our best to get there this year — we have a good chance.” Leeds United coach James Beattie proves he's still got it with this strike in training \nVieira qualifies for Guinea-Bissau, Portugal and England. \nHe has not played for any country at youth level — but admitted: “My choice will always be Portugal. \n“If they don’t come, I’m eligible to play for England.” \nThe FA should try to do something about that if Vieira continues his rapid rise. \nIt is not as if they can forget his name.
