Named after Lyndon B. Johnson, who introduced it in the Senate in 1954, the amendment bans all tax-exempt nonprofits -- including charities, universities and churches -- from endorsing or opposing political candidates. \nAny organization that violates the provision could lose its tax-exempt status. But it is rare for the IRS to punish churches or other places of worship for political statements. \nWhy does Trump want to do away with it? Trump said the Johnson Amendment infringes upon \"the right to worship according to our own beliefs.\" Doing away with the ban on participating in political campaigns and helping finance them, he said, would \"allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution.\" \nHow could it be repealed? Because the Johnson Amendment is a provision of the U.S. tax code, it requires an act of Congress to get rid of it. That doesn't mean that Trump doesn't have the power to decide whether or not the amendment will be enforced. \nWhat would happen if it is repealed? If repealed, tax-exempt organizations like churches, mosques and synagogues would be free to participate in political campaign activities, endorse political candidates and donate funds to support campaigns. \nDonors to such groups receive tax deductions for their financial contributions, but it is unclear how or whether that would change if those donations are used to finance political activities. \nWhat do area religious leaders have to say about it? The Rev. Eric Folkerth (Rex C. Curry/Special Contributor) \nThe Rev. Eric Folkerth - Northaven United Methodist Church Folkerth said he is wary of the possible repeal, as it would raise the stakes of the cultural personality of the church. Many of the members of his church support the amendment's premise, he said, and see it as an enforcer of the separation of church and state. \n\"The reason people come to church is to be renewed in their spirit. People come to church to not necessarily be away from politics or social issues, but the primary focus of church is not politicians. The primary reason is faith and the worship of God. We speak out from perspective of faith, not from what our politicians believe or don't believe.\" Dr. Robert Jeffress (Tom Fox/Staff Photographer) \nDr. Robert Jeffress - First Baptist Church of Dallas Jeffress, an outspoken Trump supporter, has talked openly about his support for the repeal of the Johnson Amendment. \n\"I want to say this very clearly, I am for repealing the Johnson Amendment,\" Jeffress said last September on the Mike Gallagher radio show . \"The Johnson Amendment and the IRS code has been abused by liberals, used by liberals to intimidate pastors.\" \nThe pastor said he has no interest in endorsing politicians from the pulpit but believes his fellow clergy members have had their views silenced on politically charged social issues such as abortion rights and same-sex marriage. \nImam Zia Sheikh \nImam Zia Sheikh - Islamic Center of Irving The leader at the Islamic Center of Irving said he's not a supporter of removing the amendment. When politics are fused with religion, he said, \"it's not a good mix.\" \n\"It's just the whole idea that a church influences politics and influences how a politician is voted for. A pastor could influence his congregation to vote a certain way,\" Sheikh said. \"I think that is a dangerous precedent.\" View Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T08:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T03:15:45.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
