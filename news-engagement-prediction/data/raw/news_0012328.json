I was happy to become Freddy once again to share the makeup process with the fans.” \nEnglund last played Krueger in 2003's Freddy vs. Jason , which marked his eighth time donning the striped sweater, fedora and, of course, the sinister glove. \nThe Krueger character was also played by Jackie Earle Haley in the 2010 Nightmare reboot. In that film, Haley's disfigured appearance was helped with some CGI. \nIt's unclear if this doc is... a wipe at that way of going about the character's look. \nNightmares in the Makeup Chair is due out later this year.
