In her piece, “Reflecting On One Very, Very Strange Year at Uber,” Fowler details how she was propositioned by her manager on one of her very first days at Uber. She immediately reported him to human resources, who suggested that she either transfer to a new team or stay on board and risk a poor performance review later on from said manager, who would not receive significant punishment, because he was a “high performer,” and “even though this was clearly sexual harassment,” she was told it was this man’s first offense. Fowler was later told that her management chain had given him a “stern talking-to,” and that they “didn’t want to ruin his career.” Later on, Fowler befriended other female engineers who had had similar experiences with other superiors at work—a few who had even been harassed by that same manager. Together they took their complaints to HR, and still nothing major was done. Aside from failing to fire the predatory manager (he eventually left the company), Uber’s gender disparity also reportedly led to a sexist environment to take over, with HR enabling it every step of the way. “Out of over 150 engineers in the SRE teams, only 3 percent were women,” wrote Fowler. “When I pointed out how few women were in SRE, [a woman in HR] recounted with a story about how sometimes certain people of certain genders and ethnic backgrounds were better suited for some jobs than others, so I shouldn’t be surprised by the gender ratios in engineering.” Uber’s CEO, Travis Kalanick, who was already in hot water following his decision to join ( and later withdraw ) from President Trump’s economic advisory council, issued a statement , in which he condemned the practices Fowler alleged. “What she describes is abhorrent and against everything Uber stands for and believes in,” the message attributed to Kalanick said. “It’s the first time this has come to my attention, so I have instructed Liane Hornsey, our new chief human resources officer, to conduct an urgent investigation into these allegations.” Uber’s latest crisis has once again brought to light Silicon Valley’s enduring gender problem. For starters, while the technology industry is one of the fastest-growing sectors in the country, most of the available jobs are overwhelmingly going to men. According to the Financial Times , only 15 percent of Uber’s technical jobs are filled by women, at Google 19 percent of technical roles are held by women, Facebook employs about the same at 17 percent, and Airbnb leads the way with a measly 26 percent. There have been other highly publicized cases of women facing off against tech companies in the last few years. In 2014, Whitney Wolfe sued Tinder after the company’s cofounder and then-CMO, Justin Mateen, reportedly sent her a series of abusive and sexist text messages after she broke off their relationship. Wolfe, who helped start the popular app, was also allegedly stripped of her cofounder title because, as she reportedly was told , “Facebook and Snapchat don’t have girl founders, it just makes it look like Tinder was some accident.” (She left the company, settled the lawsuit, and launched another dating app, Bumble.) Ellen Pao sued venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers for gender discrimination, but eventually lost the case in 2015 . That same year, engineer Tina Huang took Twitter to court for allegedly denying her promotions because of her gender . These experiences are far from an anomaly. In a study published last year, more than 200 women with at least 10 years of experience working in tech where asked to share their brushes with gender bias in Silicon Valley. Sixty percent reported they had dealt with unwanted sexual advances, and 90 percent of them said they had once witnessed sexist behavior at company offsites or at a conference. For the last few years, Silicon Valley has been praised as a haven for working women because of their generous paid leave and family-friendly policies . But in the wake of Fowler’s exposé, it’s clear the tech industry is far from the equality-embracing safe space it projects itself to be. Uber, for one, has already set up an investigation led by former Attorney General Eric Holder, to find out how this managed to happen to Fowler. It would be wise if the rest of Silicon Valley pre-emptively looked into ways of addressing the widespread gender problem they have on their hands, as well.
