Image copyright Reuters Image caption Retired Vice-Admiral Robert Harward is a 60-year-old former Navy Seal \nWhen asked about speculation that he was not allowed to bring its own staff at the National Security Council, Mr Harward told the Associated Press: \"I think that's for the president to address.\" \nRetired general and former CIA chief David Petraeus is also no longer a candidate, Mr Trump's press secretary Sean Spicer said on Saturday. \nMr Petraeus retired as CIA director in 2012 after it emerged he had given top-secret material to his biographer, with whom he was also having an extramarital affair. \nHe is still serving two years' probation after his conviction for mishandling classified information, and would need to notify his parole officer if he wished to move to Washington DC.

'Many, many want the job' \nPresident Trump deflected accusations that he was struggling to find a replacement for Gen Flynn, telling reporters on Air Force One on Saturday that he had \"many, many that want the job\". \nThe president is spending the weekend at his properties in Florida for the third week in a row. He has called his Florida Mar-a-Lago club the \"Southern White House\".
