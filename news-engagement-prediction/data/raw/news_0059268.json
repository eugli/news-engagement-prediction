If you have an incredible team of people, their business model might be wrong, the current version of their prototype might need dramatic revision, but we believe they're the best team in the world to solve that problem.\"\nRead more: Twitter Head of Music Bob Moczydlowsky Exiting\nMoczydlowsky's Techstars Music team includes former music manager Jen Hall Nicholas , Techstars program veteran Kara Gomez and Entrepreneur in Residence Matt Sandler .
