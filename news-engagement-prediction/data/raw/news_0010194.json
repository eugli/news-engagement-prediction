The performance, particularly the moment when Gaga jumped off the roof of NRG Stadium in Houston and was lowered via cables onto the stage, sparked parodies and comparisons on social media. Origin \nOn February 5th, 2017, at the beginning of the halftime show at Super Bowl LI, Lady Gaga sang a mashup of American folk songs “God Bless America” and “This Land Is Your Land,” recited a bit of the American Pledge of Allegiance, then jumped from the roof of NRG Stadium and was lowered onto her stage via cables. The moment, shown below, immediately sparked jokes and pop culture comparisons on social media. Spread \nImmediately after the jump, members of Twitter began making jokes by comparing the jump to other notable jumps in pop culture. Some of the tweets compiled in the Twitter Moment [1] around the event compared the moment to Toy Story , Professional Wrestling , and the film Black Swan (shown below). Spongebob Comparisons \nOne of the most popular comparisons people made was between Gaga’s jump and a moment in the first Spongebob Squarepants movie in which Spongebob hangs from the ceiling via rope after singing “Goofy Goober Rock.” Bustle [2] was quick to make the comparison after the show (shown below), as did many Twitter users. \nBustle [3] also published a compilation of tweets making the comparison and a reference became the top post on /r/DankMemes [4] the following day, receiving over 6,800 upvotes. “Simpsons Did It” \nA few Twitter users and media outlets noted that Gaga’s performance bore a strong resemblance to her appearance on The Simpsons episode “Lisa Goes Gaga” from 2012. In the clip, shown below, Gaga is lifted above her Simpsons-character fans, which many found similar to the way Lady Gaga entered the Super Bowl. The Daily Dot [5] and Huffington Post both covered the similarity.
