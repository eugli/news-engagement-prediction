Unlike the previous sudden-death system, both teams have a chance of getting at least one possession. If the team that wins the coin toss fails to score a touchdown, the other team will get the ball, and play continues until one team makes the game-winning score. If the teams are still tied at the end of the period, then the game simply ends. We saw two ties this season, between Seattle Seahawks - Arizona Cardinals and Cincinnati Bengals -Washington. The rules are largely the same in the Super Bowl , with some slight modifications . Obviously the Super Bowl can’t end in a tie, so if the teams are still deadlocked at the end of the period, they go to a second overtime round. Play will continue for as many periods as it requires to determine a winner, similar to MLB’s extra-innings rule. Each period has a two-minute warning and teams get three timeouts per half (two periods). If it somehow goes to a third overtime period, there is no halftime intermission, but there is another coin toss to decide possession, and timeouts will reset. If things get really wacky and we’re still tied after four overtime periods, there’s one final coin toss and play goes on until we get a winner. Despite having played 50 games, no Super Bowl has ever gone to overtime. The closest we got was the epic Super Bowl 36 encounter between the New England Patriots and St. Louis Rams . The Rams tied the game at 17-17 with just 1:30 left, but Tom Brady drove his team down the field and Adam Vinatieri hit the game-winning field goal as the clock ticked down to zero. The Patriots repeated the feat two years later, when Vinatieri made a field goal with only four seconds left to put away the Carolina Panthers , 32-29.
