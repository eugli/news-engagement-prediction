I know plenty of young people that think Milo is great, love Milo, admire Milo, think he's courageous doing what he does.\"\n  However, he added, \"I think once you even wade into the water on, even if it's just alleged pedophilia, you're gonna run out of people to defend you.\"\nThe caller, a 23-year-old \"millennial\" opined that if Milo were a Democrat the party would defend him for comments this controversial.\n\"Fabulous lesson you're learning here of the double standard,\" Limbaugh agreed. \"You hit the nail on the head. If Milo were a liberal, he could say whatever and then some, and he wouldn't be addressing CPAC, he would be emceeing the Oscars.\"\nLimbaugh offered an example of the double standard he had in mind.\n\"There's an actor that used to be on 'Star Trek,' George Takei, and he brags about his sexual experiences with much older men who taught him how to do it and comforted — that's essentially what Milo said that had him disbarred, disbanded, what have you.\"\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Mark Sanford shoots down White House claim of 'manufactured' town hall crowds \"This wasn't an artificial crowd. It wasn't manufactured. It was real people with real concerns.\"\nBy Anna Giaritelli • 02/22/17 7:23 PM The radio host pushed back against the idea that Yiannopoulos represents traditional conservatism.\n\"I go wading into the fire fit, but the conservative movement — jeez. Look at Milo. He's in his twenties. He's flamboyantly gay. We're nowhere near the conservative movement here,\" Limbaugh told the caller. \"Ideologically he's pure. Ideologically he's brave, he's right down the line, and I understand why you like him and so forth.\"\nTop Story Liberals copy Tea Party tactics to protest Trump at town halls   envisioned,  \nBy Nicole Duran • 02/22/17 6:50  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:27:21.560+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
