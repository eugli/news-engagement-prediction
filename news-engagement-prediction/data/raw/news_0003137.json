But it‚Äôs the caption that‚Äôs got fans buzzing. \n‚ÄúHouston, you are beautiful,‚Äù she wrote, along with a bee emoji. A photo posted by xoxo, Joanne (@ladygaga) on Feb 1, 2017 at 12:17pm PST \nOf course, fans are convinced the bee is an obvious nod to Queen Bey. The Beyhive has been using the bee emoji for years to show their love for the singer. Then there‚Äôs the Houston aspect ‚Äï yes, its where the big game will take place on Sunday, but it also happens to be where Beyonc√© is from. \nDoes this mean Gaga has a secret plan to bring pregnant ( with twins! ) Bey out onstage with her? It‚Äôs unclear. At this point, Gaga‚Äôs post is just fueling the rumors, and it‚Äôs likely we won‚Äôt know if the two will perform together until Sunday, when the halftime show airs. \nRegardless, we know Gaga will put on a great performance. Judging by her Instagram account, she‚Äôs been spending a lot of time prepping.
