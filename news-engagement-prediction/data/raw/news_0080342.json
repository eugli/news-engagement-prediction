Nor is the raspberry or blackberry. \nThe banana is, though. So are grapes and oranges. \nWait, what? \nJudy Jernstedt, professor of plant sciences at the University of California, says that people called some fruits berries for thousands of years before scientists gave the word a more specific definition. \n‘Usually, people think of berries as small, squishy fruit that can be picked off plants, but the scientific classification is far more complex.’ \nA berry has three layers – the outer skin, fleshy middle, and innermost part, which holds the seeds. \nFor example, a grape has an outer skin, fleshy middle and jelly-like insides which hold its seeds, making it a berry. \nUnfortunately, strawberries don’t meet these criteria – they wear their seeds on the outside.
