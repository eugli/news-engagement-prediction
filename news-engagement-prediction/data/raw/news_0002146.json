Students from the Muslim Students’ Association set up a booth on campus inviting non-Muslims to try on a head scarf. \nThose who wear the hijab said there are a lot of misconceptions about the traditions and reasons around it. \n“A lot of people think it’s foreign, so we are spreading the experience so it makes it normalized,” said Lobna Al-Wadeiah, a student with the association. \nAl-Wadeiah said it’s empowering to wear a hijab and wanted to give that experience to other women. \nThose who stopped by felt it was not only an eye-opening experience, they also wanted to show solidarity following the tragedy in Quebec City. \n“Hijabs have a stereotypical negative association and with a lot of the stuff of happening, this would be a way to show support and solidarity with Muslims,” fourth-year civil engineering student Mariam Bello said. \n“It’s something I’ve been interested in trying. I’ve never worn one before.” \nThe event was marked in 140 countries worldwide. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
