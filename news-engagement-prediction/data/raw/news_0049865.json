EDITOR’S PICK Russell Westbrook Blocked Kevin Durant Questions Like an All-Star \nAnd it's true: Williams, here for the NBA's All-Star weekend and dressed now in a gray long sleeve tee and blue Nike athletic pants, does still has traces of the ball-on-a-string, Magneto-esque mastery that produces the best of YouTube's deep library of basketball mixtapes. Of course, the deft dribbles and dimes come at the expense of much less talented players than he faced in his 13 seasons in the NBA: in slowed down pro-am games and in Friday night's NBA All-Star Celebrity game, where he showed off an ode to his famous off-the-elbow pass to Raef LaFrentz during Oakland's 2000 NBA All-Star weekend. \nNo matter. Because the new videos of him are still fun to watch, and the old ones are what the YouTube Age was made for. We caught up with the NBA legend on the Saturday of All-Star weekend, just after he ran into old pal Allen Iverson outside his hotel \"Did you see Allen Iverson, all those diamond chains he had on? He must've had a million dollars worth of jewelry around his neck!\" he said. \"At least.\" \nGQ: Seems you’re an Internet legend these days. Jason Williams : I know, it’s crazy. I just see myself as me, from Belle, West Virginia. But this [event] tomorrow is a legends media thing, and that’s really kind of why I wanted to go: [to] meet Kareem, get a picture with Oscar Robertson, stuff like that. And they’re like, “Bruh, you’re a legend.” That's kind of crazy to me. \nA few videos of you playing have made there way out into the world. What are these leagues? They’re like Pro-Am’s or Men's leagues. YMCA leagues. We got a pretty good team. And in the preseason we'll go scrimmage like Southeastern College, or Rollins College, D-II schools. We've got a good enough team to beat them most of the time. \nImagine there's quit a difference between the pickup world and the NBA. There is, because you don't have to go as hard obviously. Defense is... \nNot a thing? [ laughs ] Not really. We're good. We got shooters. Teams are so stupid. These kids that [we] play, they’ll double-team me and these [shooters] got thirty [points] apiece and haven’t missed a three. I'm 1-for-5, but they're still double-teaming me. \nDid you come up playing pick up? I would play anywhere. I'd play by myself a lot, too. I would do drills every day. \nWhat would you do? Anything. Ball-handling drills. I would go into the gym and play whole games by myself, like it was 5-on-5. \nHow? Just in my mind. [I’d] throw alley-oops to nobody. They'd go out of bounds. I'd get it and come back. [ laughs ] I could go in the gym for three hours and never shoot, just doing ball-handling drills. I didn't really like to shoot. And even when you have a partner shooting, I'd just rather rebound. I just love to work on the passing. Maybe because I wasn't a very good shooter. \nWas there a moment when you realized you were really good at this basketball thing? When everyone asked me, What are you going do? If I wasn't doing good in school and shit like that, [they'd say] \"What're you going to do?\"\"I'm going to the NBA. That's what I'm doing to do.\"\"Well, what if you don't?\"\"Well, we'll think about that when we get there.\" And honestly, it's not a knock on anything—I respect anybody who has any type of job. It's great. This is just me. If I wasn't in the NBA, I could see myself [as] a FedEx driver, a UPS driver, just because I'm out on my own. Nobody's gonna yap, yap yap. \nWould you ever go to YMCAs to run, or play pickup games, when you were in the NBA? For sure. Some of these guys can't get a \"Love of the Game\" clause in their contract, which means: [say] you're coming home from practice and you see a pickup game, and you stop and play and you get hurt. You still get your money. Some of those guys don't have that. Or some teams don't let them have it. The last year I was in Orlando, they had signed [then NBA guard] Chris Duhon. It was the end of my tenure there, sort of. So the last half of the season after practice, I had a YMCA league I started playing in. About two weeks in, the [Magic's] general manager called [my rep] Dan, and says, \"What's Jason doing?\" He said, \"What do you mean?\" He says, \"He's playing in this YMCA league, after practice, during the season.\" [My rep] said, \"He's got to get his run in somewhere.\" Because I wasn't getting to play because they just signed Duhon. \nIs it as fulfilling playing in these games now? It's great man. I still love it. I love it like no other. I love it more than anybody today. Nobody can love basketball more than me right now. I got a couple of years left to play at a good level so I'm getting it in. \nWhat do you mean, and where does that love stem from? I think these kids nowadays are just trying to go out and get 30 points. \"If I go out and get 30, I'm going to make it to the league.\" I mean everybody can't score. I wasn't big or strong enough to get my own points. But I was quick enough to get over here and make you come and help, and [then] dish it off. And that's what made us successful so I was kind of tabbed as that guy. \nDoes it scare you to not have basketball? It doesn't scare me because I haven't thought about it yet. I think I'll be able to stand there and shoot and play H-O-R-S-E for a long time. But I like to talk a little shit, too, when I play now [if] somebody starts talking or something. I won't be able to do that in a couple of years because I won't be able to back it up. \nSo were you talking trash in the Pro-Am games? I do. Only if other people start talking junk first. I don't ever want to cause any problems. But I'll talk. \nDid you talk when you played? I didn't really talk much when I played. Those guys were way too good. At any moment, they could start busting your ass. \nWhen you play those amateur games, do most those guys know who you are? Sometimes they don't but if one person yells it, or sees a picture [being taken], then everybody's like, who is that? They figure it out. \nDo guys come at you harder because you're Jason Williams? For sure. We run a play called blue, which means: we start to shoot threes. And my man made seven in a row. He'd make it; I'd kick it right back to him. [He made] seven in a row before they came down and started not letting him shoot that. Some of these guys fucking hate me. Just because we do shit like that. But we're not gonna do it if you're not disrespectful to us. We're not like that. We want no problems. But we accept problems. [ laughs ] \nDo you catch wind when these YouTube mixtapes of yours make big splashes online? I do. My friends send them to me. Social media rules the world. I just got a Twitter account like three weeks ago. A month ago. My agent wanted me to do it. I don't really know nothing about Twitter. I'm 40 years old. \nSo you and Shaq are neighbors. I've got this great image of you two being neighborly, bringing each other cookies or something. Shaq's the greatest guy ever, man. His pool, bro, one end is like 22 feet deep. He's got these stuffed animals that he's killed on these safari hunts. Things like hyenas and just the craziest shit you've ever seen. He's the greatest. What you see is what you get with him. \nWhat's the coolest thing in Shaq's house? I don't know if there's one thing. I was over there this summer and he was getting this fish tank, the guys from Tanked were there. He has this big semi, the front end of this semi truck, like an 18-wheel, on the side of his wall. And there's a picture of him driving the thing in the windshield. But it's a fish tank, with the biggest fish you've ever seen. He has this big carp that he had to put at SeaWorld to hold while he was getting this one built. \nHow was playing high school ball with Randy Moss? He could've played in the league too if he wanted to. I think he could've played in the MLB if he wanted to. But I mean he just chose football and that's what he decided to do. And forget it. \nHow does your competitiveness manifest itself outside basketball? Sometimes it gets me in trouble. Like, last night we were on the way home from the game and my 7-year-old daughter said something along the lines of, \"If you don't win, it's okay, as long as you have fun.\" I said, \"No.\" Right away: \"No. Winning is all that matters.\" And she's like, \"Well not if you just have fun.\" I said, \"No. No .\" And my 12-year-old daughter, who is at LSU on a recruiting visit right now at 12, said, \"Yeah, Nina, it's all about winning.\" So hopefully she gets it. I wish my son would've heard that. It would've been great. \nI'm glad you got the ring then. Would it have bugged you if you'd never gotten the ring? I wouldn't say bugged, because so many players way better than I ever thought about being—I mean, I thought about being those guys but no chance of getting there—that don't have a ring. So I'm thankful for that. It wouldn't have bugged me, but just [for] the people that said I couldn't get it done, that shut them up. Which is cool. And I wouldn't have been able to say that. You can say anything you want but you can't take the ring away. \nThis interview has been edited and condensed.
