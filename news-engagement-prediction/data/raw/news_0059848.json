Snooze, “an A.M. Eatery,” is coming to Katy to help cure those morning blues. Announced via release, Snooze will be opening a Katy location LaCenterra at Cinco Ranch. The eatery made its Houston debut with great success last July and intends to become a morning community hub for Katy as well. Snooze seems to be attempting a Houston area takeover. As previously reported at Eater, two locations in the Heights and Town and Country are also in the works. Snooze is no boring eggs and bacon joint (though if classic is what you want, they’ve got options for you). The menu will feature items like the breakfast pot pie, chile verde eggs benedict, and molten chocolate pancakes. Obviously they will offer basic breakfast beverages, but Snooze also has a pretty impressive cocktail menu. Try the Bacon and Eggs with bacon infused whiskey, house sour, egg whites, bitters, and bacon. No official opening date, but Snooze should be open by the end of the year. Like its other Houston locations, the breakfast purveyor will be open from 6:30 AM to 2:30 PM daily.
