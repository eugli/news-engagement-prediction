Is Trump's bleak vision of America justified? Canada town taking refugees from US Is US heading for constitutional crisis? It is not clear how the new text will differ from the original measure.\nCommentators say a repeat of the chaos that followed the initial order could be another blow to an administration that has been at the centre of a series of controversies with just one month in office.\nMr Trump's initial order, signed in January, banned anyone from seven majority-Muslim countries - Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan and Libya - from entering the US for 90 days.\nIt also halted refugee resettlement for 120 days and banned Syrian refugees indefinitely.\nBut the measure was blocked by a Seattle court, in a decision that was later upheld by 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which said the government had not proved the terror threat justified reviving the ban.\nMr Trump has criticised the court decision, saying \"the security of our nation is at stake\".", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38911708", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/829836231802515457", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/D0DE/production/_94807435_7b6a993e-135c-459d-b80f-baf8f310d9e3.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38817701", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-39044403"], "published": "2017-02-23T06:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T10:20:42.435+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
