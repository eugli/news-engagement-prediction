But what does fake news actually mean? \nOn one level, the term seems pretty self-explanatory. Fake news is a story that’s completely false, usually invented for traffic and ad revenue, or to advance a political agenda — or both. \nNews hoaxes aren’t new, but there’s a growing sense that social media, particularly Facebook, has made it easier for these stories to spread, and for fake news to become a viable business model. (Who’s actually publishing these stories? Well, their exact identity is still a bit mysterious .) \nFor example, a study by BuzzSumo found that the biggest fake news story of 2016, about then-President Barack Obama supposedly banning the Pledge of Allegiance in schools, received more than 2 million Facebook shares, comments and reactions. Other popular stories — including one suggesting that Pope Francis had endorsed Donald Trump and another that Trump was offering free one-way tickets to Africa and Mexico — also got hundreds of thousands of shares, comments and reactions. The impact of fake news \nWe’ve even seen arguments that Facebook contributed to the Electoral College victory of Donald Trump by facilitating the spread of fake news. In response, the social network has rolled out new features aimed at making it easier for users to flag and remove fake stories. \nTo be clear, economists Matthew Grentzkow of Stanford University and Hunt Allcott of New York University have done research showing that social media had a smaller influence on the election than you might think, with TV still playing a much larger role. \nStill, fake news can have real consequences: As a result of the “Pizzagate” rumor supposedly tying Hillary Clinton to a child sex ring at the Washington, D.C. restaurant Comet Ping Pong, a man actually showed up at Comet Ping Pong with an assault rifle .

One reason for optimism: As the issue has become more prominent, the big players — not just Facebook — have been talking about solutions. \nRandall Rothenberg, president and CEO of the Interactive Advertising Bureau (a trade organization for online publishers and advertisers), has called for tech and media companies to “actively banish fakery, fraudulence, criminality, and hatred.” Some companies are already taking steps in this direction: Google said that it banned 200 publishers in the last quarter of of 2016 as part of an effort to crack down on fake news sites. Enter President Trump \nAt the same time, the term itself has mutated — or, to put it more bluntly, co-opted, a trend that reached its peak with President Donald Trump describing both The New York Times and CNN as “fake news.” \nTo be clear, no one — not The Times, not CNN, not any publication — is above criticism, but that’s not exactly what Trump is doing. He’s taking the “fake news” label, originally used to describe fly-by-night websites that intentionally deceive readers, and slapping it on organizations with long histories of real journalism. \nWith his cries of “fake news” (and, conversely, Kellyanne Conway’s defense of “alternative facts” ), Trump and his subordinates are giving Americans a simple message, one that he’s repeated plenty of times: “Believe me” — not the media. Comment trolls: Just because you disagree with a post doesn't make it \"fake news\" \n— Anna (@annaescher) January 20, 2017 \nIn this environment, “fake news” is becoming the equivalent of “clickbait” — just another way of saying “news that I don’t like.” In fact, The Washington Post’s Margaret Sullivan has suggested that the term has become so “tainted” by misuse that it should be retired altogether: “Instead, call a lie a lie. Call a hoax a hoax. Call a conspiracy theory by its rightful name.” Crunchbase Facebook Founded 2004 Overview Facebook is an online social networking service that allows its users to connect with friends and family as well as make new connections.
