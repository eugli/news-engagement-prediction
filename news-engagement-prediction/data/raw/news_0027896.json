More A photo of Ivanka Trump sitting in the president’s chair is creating a storm of activity on social media. America’s first daughter shared the picture on her social media accounts. It shows her sitting behind the Oval Office desk, flanked by her father, U.S. President Donald Trump, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. She captioned it: “A great discussion with two world leaders about the importance of women having a seat at the table!” The post sparked a frenzy on Twitter. Critics said Ivanka hadn’t earned the right to sit behind the desk. @IvankaTrump Only one world leader at that table & it isn't @POTUS or his daughter \n— Alexander L.
