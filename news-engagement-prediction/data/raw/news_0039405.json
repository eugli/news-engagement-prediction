The captain had no choice but to surrender. The Japanese ordered the vessel into harbour on Banka Island. Ruth and her fellow passengers were made to disembark, taking one small suitcase each. A fter spending the night huddled on the pier, they were marched to a squalid barracks and incarcerated along with survivors of other ships captured or sunk. They were fortunate — many others had been massacred by the Japanese, including 21 Australian nurses who were machine-gunned on the beach. On board ship Ruth had become friendly with a British nurse named Christine Bundy. They came to rely on each other in the months and years to come. Christine was practical, while Ruth’s joie de vivre was infectious. Back in Singapore, Denis was one of 50,000 men in Changi prisoner of war camp, in a barracks designed for 5,000. On Banka, the women and children were separated from the men and moved to a camp on Sumatra, crammed into tiny houses and forced to sleep on concrete floors. Their guards demanded servile obedience. Any woman who failed to bow was slapped viciously across the face. Some were beaten, or forced to stand out in the midday sun till they fainted. They had to grow their own vegetables, chop wood and carry heavy loads. Twice a day, under the burning sun they had to stand to attention for ‘Tenko,’ the headcount. Women like Ruth who had had servants to cook and clean for them, now found themselves reduced to ragged slaves, surviving on handfuls of rice. Every few months the Japanese would herd them into lorries and move them to another camp. To begin with, Ruth’s resilience saw her through. She joined the camp choir and, alarmed that the rice-only diet had made her stomach distended, she would jog around the camp’s barbed wire perimeter. But as the months wore on and food became scarcer, Ruth and her companions grew thinner and weaker. The makeshift camp hospital was permanently full as malnutrition caused the women’s limbs and bellies to swell with beri-beri. Tropical ulcers ate away at their flesh and dysentery was rife. So starving were they that once, when a stray dog loped into the camp with a piece of liver in its mouth, the women snatched the liver, washed it and devoured it. Meanwhile, the Japanese refused to hand out Red Cross food parcels that would have saved many lives. Instead, they ate the tinned food intended for the starving women and children. The death toll mounted. A few women succumbed to the advances of the Japanese guards and sold their bodies for extra food to keep themselves or their children alive. Those with money or jewels could exchange them for food from Chinese traders who came to the barbed wire surrounding the camp. Ruth sold a pair of earrings, her engagement ring and a diamond wristwatch. But she would not sell her emerald, ruby and diamond eternity ring, a gift from Denis. For many, the worst torment was not knowing what had happened to their loved ones. Ruth was desperate for contact with Denis. In May 1942, she had feigned toothache in order to go to the local hospital to meet a Chinese trader who regularly travelled to Singapore. Risking torture or death by the Kempei Tai, the notorious Japanese secret police, if they were caught — communication with the outside world was strictly forbidden — she gave him a letter to take to Denis in Changi. M iraculously, some months later it reached him. ‘I work hard here, cooking, scrubbing, cleaning, and I used to chop wood, but have had to give that up as it was too much for me,’ she wrote. ‘I live solely on the thought of being reunited with you and Lynette. Look after yourself darling, don’t worry about me,’ she told him bravely, ‘I can take it, Ruth.’ Denis treasured the letter, proof that Ruth was alive. But it was not until more than two years had passed that he was able to respond. He made friends with a sergeant in the Japanese air force, who was going to Sumatra and persuaded the man to risk his life to take a letter to Ruth. By the time the sergeant reached the women’s camp in Sumatra, they were gone — they’d been moved again. Now so emaciated that even sitting down was painful, Ruth and her fellow women were driven ever harder by the Japanese, labouring in the fields, carrying heavy loads till they collapsed. Ruth’s friendship with Christine, together with the news that Lynette had arrived safely in England more than two years earlier, sustained her. She was determined to stay alive to be reunited with Lynette and Denis. Then a virulent strain of malaria struck the camp. In January 1945, Ruth caught it and was admitted to hospital, desperately ill. Christine persuaded her to sell her eternity ring to buy food that might save her life. Reluctantly, she agreed. The woman who exchanged it through the barbed wire brought back with her not only food but a folded piece of paper. It was Denis’s letter, at last. Lieut-General A.E. Percival, Commanding chief of the last garrison of Singapore is on his way to sign the deed of its surrender in 1942 Christine read it to Ruth. He wrote of his life in Changi and ‘of our reunion which . . . could not now be long delayed’. She was now too weak to speak but she nodded and smiled. Then she turned over onto her side and drew her last breath. The next day she was buried in the jungle, another wooden cross in the makeshift cemetery that was rapidly filling up. Eight months later the Japanese surrendered. Back in Singapore, Denis was desperate to be reunited with his darling wife. On September, 14 he received the message he had been waiting for. The women prisoners from Sumatra were due to arrive at Singapore’s Alexandra Hospital shortly. It was only when he saw the women walking towards him, ill, weary and thin that he felt ‘a lump come into my throat, and for the very first time a little stab of pain, of dread of what might be’. He spotted Ruth’s friend Christine, but not Ruth. Then Christine came over to him. ‘She was overcome and found it difficult to say anything. She squeezed my hand and whispered in my ear, “I’m so sorry, Denis.” It was just like that.’ Unable to speak, Denis turned and walked away, and kept on walking until, alone, ‘I lay on my bed and allowed my feelings to take control’. Some weeks later, he returned to England, to the daughter he had not seen for more than three years. ‘I looked at her intently, half consciously searching for a likeness to Ruth .. . as though she saw the look of uncertainty in my face, she took me firmly by the hand and led me into the garden.’ Twenty years after the war, by then remarried, he published a touching memoir, Spotlight On Singapore, telling the story of his and Ruth’s captivity. He wrote it as a tribute not only to Ruth and her fellow prisoners, but to the Japanese sergeant who had risked his life to take the letter to Ruth that she read before she died — a last token of love from the husband with whom she had so longed to be reunited.   5", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T09:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T05:23:00.810+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
