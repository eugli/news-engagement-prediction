A post shared by Corinne Olympios (@colympios) on Dec 19, 2016 at 7:25am PST \nHowever, judging by her history of appearing in rap videos and looking for fame , we think she’ll at least consider her latest offer from Pornhub. \nYes, the online porn emporium has reached out to the 25-year-old via a letter from the company’s vice president, Corey Price. A post shared by Corinne Olympios (@colympios) on Dec 15, 2013 at 7:54am PST \nDated today, February 21, he notes the team had seen her in the 2011 video for 2 Chainz’s “Zip & A Double Cup,” calling her a “standout.” \n“We were enamored with your talent,” Corey writes. “So much so that we’d like to feature you in an upcoming music video for Pornhub Records.” \nHe goes on to explain that Pornhub’s record label, launched in 2014, has worked alongside Flo Rida, Coolio, Waka Flocka, and other hip hop stars. \nNow, it’s interesting that such a low-energy showing from the Miami gal — one that even spurred 2 Chainz to worry aloud , “is she OK?!”— would impress them so much. \nThen again, maybe it’s all of the additional scantily-dressed pics the reality star has taken and shared on social media. A post shared by Corinne Olympios (@colympios) on Jan 14, 2014 at 3:04pm PST \nNot to mention, this is the gal who once wrote in her Model Mayhem bio , “I will do whatever it takes to fulfill my dreams and goals,” and even filmed another reality pilot called Unorthodox Approach prior to the ABC franchise. \nBut would she actually accept the offer? \nWe’re not convinced, though the company does throw in three pretty enticing incentives: “Voodoo dolls will be permitted on set.” \n“You will have free rein to take as many naps on set as you’d like — I mean Jordan and Lincoln took naps.” A post shared by Corinne Olympios (@colympios) on Feb 20, 2017 at 9:34am PST \n“We are open to including your nanny Raquel in the video. Let us know if you’d like to share the spotlight.” \nThey’re also open to “additional requests,” the VP details. \n“Quite simply, we want to make Corinne great again,” he concludes. “Let’s take the music industry by storm and do this.” A post shared by Corinne Olympios (@colympios) on Feb 5, 2017 at 3:35pm PST \nA good pitch all in all, though we’re guessing the outspoken blonde will have to pass in order to appear on Bachelor in Paradise 4 this summer — if she doesn’t continue on Nick’s “journey,” of course. \nHey, maybe in a couple of years? \nThe Bachelor Season 21 airs Mondays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC. \nCheck out more of Wetpaint ’s coverage of The Bachelor below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:49:15.537+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
