If this room leaned anymore to the left, we would literally topple into the Pacific Ocean.\" \nNick Kroll and John Mulaney didn't hold back while hosting the Spirit Awards on Saturday afternoon. \nThe duo opened the indie-lauding awards show, or \"Hollywood's biggest afternoon,\" with punchlines centering on Donald Trump, Steve Bannon, Mel Gibson, Shia LaBeouf and Casey Affleck. \n\"These are the awards without Mel Gibson,\" said Kroll of the Hacksaw Ridge director, adding that it apparently takes eight years for Hollywood to forgive a star for making anti-Semitic comments. Therefore, in 2024, the Spirit Awards will honor Steve Bannon. \n\"The only reason he got that job is because he's so hot,\" said Kroll. \"He looks like if Nick Offerman drowned.\" Mulaney added of Bannon, \"Those chapped kneecaps!\" \nKroll also booed Trump's rollback of transgender bathroom access \"because transgender children in public schools have had it too good for too long.\" Mulaney noted, \"Hey Trump, you and Robert Durst are both rich sociopaths from New York, but somehow Robert Durst is more likable.\" \nAnd to those winners who want to make political acceptance speeches, Mulaney reminded them that they're being broadcast on IFC: \"You can deliver your speech directly into camera, or you can whisper it to yourself in the bathroom.\" \nKroll further stressed, \"We're not in a bubble, we're in a tent [on the beach]. ... If this room leaned anymore to the left, we would literally topple into the Pacific Ocean.\" \nThe two also poked fun at the nominated films. \"These films are, to quote the president, 'Sad!'\" said Mulaney, with Kroll stressing, \"These movies were so harsh, I had to watch A Dog's Purpose to cheer up, and I mean the behind-the-scenes footage!\" \nOf the nominated titles, Casey Affleck starred in Manchester by the Sea as \"a man who is living in the shadow of his older brother â€” what a reach!\" and Moonlight was directed by Barry Jenkins, the name Trump thinks is also Barack Obama's name. They also had a joke about American Honey star LaBeouf about getting arrested at his art installation, but then he did in fact get arrested and was not in attendance. \nThe 32nd Film Independent Spirit Awards aired live on IFC on Saturday, Feb. 25. Nick Kroll and John Mulaney hosted the ceremony, held in a tent on the beach in Santa Monica.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T00:42:27.448+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
