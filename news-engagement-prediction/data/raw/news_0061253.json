SEE ALSO: Leaked photos show just how sexy Samsung's Galaxy S8 could look \nMost specs aren't out of the ordinary, and some, like the 12-megapixel dual rear camera and 4GB of RAM, are slightly underwhelming. But the spec sheet claims the device will have a huge, 6.2-inch screen (or, in reality, a 6.1-inch screen if you consider the rounded corners). Samsung Galaxy S8+ spec sheet. Impress your friends, confound your enemies...with knowledge. pic.twitter.com/lHrHge8BUa \n— Evan Blass (@evleaks) February 22, 2017 \nThis pretty much confirms a set of renders posted in January, which claimed the larger version of the device will have a 6.3-inch screen, in a body that's not significantly larger than that of the 5.5-inch Galaxy S7 Edge. \nHow is this possible? Well, with the home button gone at the bottom and the Samsung logo on top gone, the screen will take a much bigger portion of the phone's face. Welcome to the era of huge-screened smartphones in not-so-huge bodies. \nOther specs of note include 64GB of memory with microSD card support, an iris scanner, dust and water resistance, wireless charging and earphones \"tuned by AKG.\" \nOriginally slated to launch in February, the Galaxy S8 — and it's larger brother — are now expected to launch in April. Nothing has been officially confirmed at this point, though we might get an official teaser video later this week at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.
