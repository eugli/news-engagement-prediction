(Photo: MICHAEL REYNOLDS, EPA)\n189 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 4 COMMENT EMAIL MORE A story in The Washington Post raises questions about Vice President Mike Pence 's comments defending communications between an adviser to President Donald Trump and a Russian diplomat.\nThe Post, citing unnamed current and former U.S. officials, reported Thursday that Trump's national security adviser Michael Flynn privately discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.\nThe new revelations contradict statements Pence made last month, five days before he was sworn in as vice president.\n\"I talked to Gen. Flynn about that conversation,\" Pence told CBS' John Dickerson on Jan. 15. “They did not discuss anything having to do with the United States’ decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia.”\nThe Post story pokes holes in Pence's comments, but does not address whether Pence knew all the details when he defended Flynn in the interview in that interview. One source told the Post that Pence may have been misled or misspoke.\nSome U.S. officials called the communications between Flynn and Kislyak inappropriate and possibly illegal when they came to light last month, the Post reported.\nNational security adviser Michael Flynn privately discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with that country’s ambassador to the United States during the month before President Trump took office, contrary to public assertions by Trump officials, current and former U.S. officials said.\nFlynn’s communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were interpreted by some senior U.S. officials as an inappropriate and potentially illegal signal to the Kremlin that it could expect a reprieve from sanctions that were being imposed by the Obama administration in late December to punish Russia for its alleged interference in the 2016 election.\nFlynn on Wednesday denied that he had discussed sanctions with Kislyak. Asked in an interview whether he had ever done so, he twice said, “No.”\nCLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed\nx Share\nMichael Flynn would be an addition to Trump's cabinet that has many top Democrats on edge.
