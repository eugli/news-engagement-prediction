(ABC News: Chris O'Brien) \nHe found the driver shortfall was not widely understood across QR, which had a culture of \"relying on intuition, complacency and being reluctant to share bad news\". \nHe said QR's chief executive did not actively investigate whether adequate measures were being taken to address the crew shortage, and the QR board was not informed, so did not report the problem to the State Government or the public. \nMr Strachan described QR's structure as unwieldy, with eight layers of bureaucracy resulting in \"complex and ineffective governance\". \nHis inquiry outlines a range of fixes to boost train driver numbers, including opening recruitment to external applicants, including those with no previous rail experience. \nThe report recommends QR \"deliver and maintain a structural surplus of train crew\" to avoid a \"systemic reliance\" on overtime. \nIt said QR management should also exercise discretion over granting leave and recommended the chief's executives responsibilities be extended to include formal approval of timetable changes. \nThe inquiry found that despite working hard to recover from the crisis, QR only expected to resume regularly timetabled services by late next year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T11:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T16:28:53.374+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
