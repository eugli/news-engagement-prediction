At that point, the vice-principal at the school addressed the students before instructing the driver to get the children \"home immediately.\"\nThe driver left the school to resume the route, but stopped again for 20 minutes before dropping off the remaining students, the letter said.\nMore than three dozen students are on that bus route.\nParkview Transit defended the behaviour of its driver in a statement to CTV Toronto.\n\"The level of misbehaviour on the bus was severe enough that our driver had to stop the bus and then return to the school, in compliance with our safety protocols,\" Parkview said in the statement.\nThe bus company says it investigated the situation and concluded that the driver did everything correctly.\nHowever, Peel District School Board spokesperson Carla Pereira says the driver failed to notify Parkview at the time of the incident.\n\"What should happen is that once that happens, the driver should report that to dispatch,\" Pereira told CTV Toronto. \"That didn't happen in this particular situation, so that is something we're looking into.\"\nSTOPR, the third-party organization that arranges bus routes in the Peel school board, has a policy that drivers must \"deliver students to their scheduled destination, even if they display unruly behaviour.\"\nThe driver declined to speak to CTV Toronto.\nWith files from CTV Toronto and CP24", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:40:21.225+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
