It was an outstanding performance.” Liverpool moved back into the top four, above Manchester City, who visit Bournemouth on Monday, and Manchester United, who briefly climbed above them after beating Watford 2-0. Reds' knee-taking tactic 0:46 \nTottenham remain second, but they are now level on points with Arsenal after Alexis Sanchez scored twice to earn Arsene Wenger’s side a much-needed 2-0 victory over Hull City. \nSpurs’ setback means Chelsea can move 12 points clear at the summit if they win at Burnley on Sunday. \nWhile the title seems destined for Stamford Bridge, the battle for positions below Chelsea could not be more tight, with two points separating Spurs in second and United in sixth. \nSeventh-place Everton squandered a chance to close on the teams above them after being held to a 0-0 draw at 15th-place Middlesbrough. Sanchez's contentious goal 0:32 \nSunderland remain bottom of the table after Southampton’s new Italian striker Manolo Gabbiadini scored a slick brace in a 4-0 win at the Stadium of Light. \nJason Denayer also put through his own goal before Shane Long completed the scoring in added time. \nSecond-bottom Crystal Palace were also beaten, Joe Allen scoring in the second half to give Stoke City a 1-0 win that saw Mark Hughes’s team climb to ninth. \nGareth McAuley was credited with a stoppage-time equaliser for West Bromwich Albion in a 2-2 draw at West Ham United. \nAfter Nacer Chadli put West Brom ahead in the fifth minute, West Ham hit back through Sofiane Feghouli and Manuel Lanzini, only for McAuley to get a decisive touch to Jonny Evans’s header at the death. Mata's shoe toss celebration \nLIVERPOOL 2, TOTTENHAM 0 \nLiverpool badly missed Mane during his time at the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal and he gave a dazzling display of his qualities with two goals in the first 18 minutes at Anfield. \nFor the first goal, in the 16th minute, he raced onto Georginio Wijnaldum’s incisive pass before lifting a shot past Hugo Lloris. \nTwo minutes later he made it 2-0 with his 11th goal of the season, sparking a raid on the Spurs box by robbing Eric Dier and then slamming in after Lloris had saved from Adam Lallana and Roberto Firmino. \n“We could have scored again,” Klopp said. “There were some outstanding individual performances.” Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino pulled no punches, saying: “The whole team were poor. It is about balance and today it was poor. That is the truth. \n“In the first 45 minutes you saw a team that is not ready to fight for the Premier League.” Report: Reds knock off Spurs 1:24 \nMANCHESTER UNITED 2, WATFORD 0 \nUnited closed to within a point of the Champions League places by beating Watford, Anthony Martial marking his return to the starting XI by scoring and setting up the opener for Juan Mata. \nJose Mourinho’s side have now gone 16 league games unbeaten and while they remain sixth, they are just a point below both Liverpool and City. \n“Martial deserves the chance,” Mourinho told the BBC. “He has worked harder than ever in the last two weeks in the way I like: silence, but hard.” He added: “In the first half the football was fabulous. When I got the job, they were saying at Manchester United you need to play football in a certain way and I agree.” Report: Watford fall to Man U 1:28 \nARSENAL 2, HULL CITY 0 \nAt the Emirates Stadium, Sanchez brought the under-fire Wenger some breathing space as Arsenal overcame third-bottom Hull. \nThe Chilean forward contentiously scored with his hand in the 34th minute and netted a stoppage-time penalty after Sam Clucas had been sent off for handball to take his tally for the campaign to 17 goals. \n- Martial shines - \nIt got Arsenal back to winning ways following successive defeats by Watford and Chelsea and left them in third place, nine points behind Chelsea. \nWenger dismissed a claim by former Arsenal striker Ian Wright that he had admitted his time at the club was coming to an end. \n“I didn’t give any indication about my future,” Wenger told reporters. “You know I appreciate very much that you want me to rest, absolutely. But I am not ready for that yet.” Report: Gunners top Hull 1:34 \nSTOKE CITY 1, CRYSTAL PALACE 0 \nSam Allardyce’s poor run since taking over Crystal Palace was compounded at Stoke City on Saturday as Joe Allen’s slick finish gave the hosts a 1-0 Premier League win. \nThe defeat leaves Palace second bottom on goal difference and the south Londoners have won just once in eight games since the former England boss, who has never suffered relegation from the top flight, took over. \nIn driving rain on a wintery afternoon of lashing winds Stoke City came out wearing short sleeves and a look of grim determination ahead of what the players clearly suspected would be a gritty affair. \nThe goal when it came was one of rare beauty, however, as Marko Arnautovic lofted an angled pass into the box on 67 minutes that Ramadan Sobhi held up, awaiting Allen’s run and setting him up with perfect timing. \nAllen’s instinctive snap shot whipped into the opposite bottom corner beyond the clutching grasp of Wayne Hennessey, his Welsh international teammate. Report: Stoke edge Palace 1:31 \nSUNDERLAND 0, SOUTHAMPTON 4 \nSouthampton striker Manolo Gabbiadini punished struggling Sunderland with a double strike that inspired his side’s 4-0 victory at the Stadium of Light on Saturday. \nGabbiadini was on target twice before half-time to maintain his impressive form since his £14 million ($17 million, 16 million euros) move from Napoli in January. \nJason Denayer’s own goal and a Shane Long strike ensured Southampton cruised to only their second win in their last eight league games, ending a run of three successive defeats since they booked their place in the League Cup final. Report: Saints net 4 in win 1:25 \nWEST HAM 2, WEST BROM 2 \nGareth McAuley’s header deep in stoppage time salvaged a 2-2 draw for West Brom in an entertaining Premier League encounter at West Ham’s London Stadium on Saturday. \nSlaven Bilic’s men were eyeing all three points after goals from Sofiane Feghouli and Manuel Lanzini but for McAuley’s dramatic late intervention. \nWest Ham were without in-form striker Andy Carroll, missing with a groin injury, with Lanzini standing in as the only change. Report: Hammers, Baggies draw 1:34 \nMIDDLESBROUGH 0, EVERTON 0 \nMiddlesbrough goalkeeper Victor Valdes and his Everton counterpart Joel Robles shared the limelight as their sides played out a 0-0 draw in the Premier League on Saturday. \nValdes saved sharply from the in-form Romelu Lukaku and Ademola Lookman, while Robles produced a stunning late stop to prevent substitute Rudy Gestede giving Boro victory at the Riverside Stadium. \nEverton have now gone eight games unbeaten in the league, but after four wins in their previous five games, this was a missed opportunity for Ronald Koeman’s side to make up ground on the teams above them. \nThe Merseyside club remain seventh, while Aitor Karanka’s Middlesbrough stay 15th, two points above the relegation zone, after an eighth successive league outing without a win.
