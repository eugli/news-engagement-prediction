County Fire Department extended a ladder to two people in a car submerged in water. A man and his daughter were able to get on the roof of the car and then onto the ladder. Shortly after, a second car drifted along and fire crews were able to extend a ladder and rescue that man as well. \nNeighbors in the Newhall area near the Master’s College watched anxiously as firefighters extended a ladder from their truck for the rescue. \nCheryl Child could only think of her own daughter as she watched on. \n“How scary it must’ve been for that little girl,” Child said. \nNo injuries were reported. \nPeople in this area say this latest series of rain has caused a set of homes to be blocked off by the moving water. \nMaking matters worse, some of them have medical conditions and they’re not able to tend to them. \n“It’s not passable. The fire department can’t get through. We haven’t had any garbage collection for three weeks,” a neighbor said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T11:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T05:07:27.230+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
