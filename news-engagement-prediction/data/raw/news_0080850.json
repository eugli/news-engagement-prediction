Paxton starred opposite newcomer Justin Cornwell as a seasoned, morally ambiguous detective who is part of an elite LAPD squad. \n\"We are shocked and deeply saddened this morning by the news of Bill Paxton's passing,\" CBS and producers Warner Bros. Television said Sunday in a statement. \"Bill was, of course, a gifted and popular actor with so many memorable roles on film and television. His colleagues at CBS and Warner Bros. Television will also remember a guy who lit up every room with infectious charm, energy and warmth, and as a great storyteller who loved to share entertaining anecdotes and stories about his work. All of us here offer our deepest sympathy to his wife, Louise, and his two children.\" \nTraining Day airs Thursdays at 10 p.m. on CBS.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T04:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:30:42.197+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
