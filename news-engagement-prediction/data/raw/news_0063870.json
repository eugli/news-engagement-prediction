Leaders at Denver International Airport plan to add some this year.\nIn total, Orlando International will get 14 nursing rooms — 10 permanent and four portable. \nThe permanent nursing rooms are expected to be completed between April and May and will be connected to restrooms in the airport, said Carolyn Fennell, airport spokeswoman. The portable ones, which will be standalone structures, will be in place by late April. \nThe portable rooms will be spread throughout the airside and landside portions of the airport, giving passengers access to dedicated, private spaces before and after security checkpoints. \nOf the permanent rooms, six will be airside, while four will be landside, said Fennell. \n“It’s really important for the traveling public,” said Dr. Joan Meek, past chair of the United States Breastfeeding Committee Board of Directors. \nMeek said a lot of women “believe they can’t combine breastfeeding and working and travel.” \nBrown said Orlando International regularly sees a large volume of families. The demand for nursing rooms in the airport reflects the type of travelers coming here, he said. \n“What we’re seeing is there’s a need for it,” Brown said. “So what we’re trying to do is position for it.” \nMeek, the associate dean for Graduate Medical Education at the Florida State University College of Medicine, said without dedicated space to nurse, women are left picking between public exposure, covering the child with a cloth or finding privacy in a bathroom. \n“The restroom is the last best place for that,” Meek said. “Would you eat your meal in a restroom?” \nAirport leaders are designing the south terminal expansion, and nursing rooms are part of that discussion, said Brown. \n“We’re still working through the final design, but we still have that,” he said. “We're going to have that capability.” \nCentral Florida’s other airport also has plans to meet the demand and need for nursing rooms. \nPlans for the $43 million expansion at Orlando Sanford International Airport’s call for the addition of nursing rooms, said Diane Crews, the airport’s president and chief executive officer. Expansion plans include adding new gates, baggage carousels and security lanes over the next several years. \nFennell said the rooms will not just benefit mothers traveling with their children, adding they’ll equally service pumping mothers coming to the region for business or attending conventions. \nOnce they’ve left the airport, those mothers, in particular, are being accommodated at the Orange County Convention Center with private rooms to pump or nurse. \n“Each show sets them up for nursing mothers,” said Gwen Wilson, the center’s spokeswoman. “We also use our medical offices.” \nGot a news tip? cdineen@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5414; Twitter: @CaitlinDineen Caption January home sales by the numbers \nThe National Assn. of Realtors said home sales rose 3.3% in January from December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.69 million.
