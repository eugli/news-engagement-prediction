The names hint at the display sizes, with the 50 Graphite model featuring a 5.0” display and the 55 Graphite featuring a 5.5” display. The 55 Graphite model is a bit more notable over the 50 model, though, also packing things like USB-C. \nARCHOS has unveiled the devices ahead of its Mobile World Congress 2017 appearance. The 55 Graphite model features a 5.5-inch IPS Full Lamination HD display with a 2.5D contoured edge. The model also features a Mediatek MT6737 quad-core 1.5Ghz chipset alongside a couple gigabytes of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. \nUsers can expand the phone’s internal storage via a microSD card slot, which supports cards with capacities up to 128GB. The phone also boasts dual-camera arrangement on the back, sporting both a 13MP and a 2MP camera on the back as well as a 5MP front-facing camera. Says the company, this dual-camera setup lends bokeh abilities, as well as a way to snap ultra-wide-angle photos and sharper images. \nAlso notable is this model’s fingerprint sensor, which ARCHOS says can unlock the phone is less than a third of a single second. There are also dual SIM slots for those who need them and support for 4G LTE networks. The phone has a premium micro USB-C port rather than micro USB, and it also boasts a 3,000mAh battery. \nThe ARCHOS 50 Graphite version is similar in some ways, being described as a ‘lighter version’ of the 55 offering. With this model, users get a 5-inch IPS HD display with that same 2.5D contouring, as well as half the memory and storage (though the microSD card slot remains).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T07:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T02:13:26.912+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
