Chris Nolter Feb9,201712:58PMEST \nTwitter ( TWTR ) reported adjusted non-GAAP earnings of 16 cents a share for the fourth quarter of 2016, topping forecasts by 4 cents. Revenue of $717 million, however, missed Wall Street's call for $740 million in sales, fanning questions about Twitter's ability to make money from a service that has grown in prominence with the election of President Donald Trump. \nShares were down nearly 10% at midday Thursday to $16.77. Co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey told investors on an earnings call that Twitter is honing its social media network with artificial intelligence and machine learning to simplify the service for users and prove its value to advertisers. \"The superpower we really provide the world is we can break news and get information to people faster than anyone else,\" Dorsey said. The company is applying AI, he said, to ensure that Twitter remains \"that little bird that told you something\" you couldn't find out faster from someone else. While President Trump's frenzied tweeting underscores Twitter's importance in politics and news, the company has struggled to show engagement on par with Facebook ( FB ) and Snapchat. Average users per month grew 4% to 319 million in the fourth quarter. The company also disclosed that its daily average users , or DAUs, increased 11% in the fourth quarter, but would not provide an absolute number for DAUs. Time spent on the app also grew by double-digit percentage points, though the company did not disclose greater detail on engagement. While sales in the fourth quarter disappointed, Twitter's revenue increased by 14% to $2.5 billion for 2016 as a whole. Since becoming Twitter's CEO in July 2015, Jack Dorsey has focused on rolling out video of sports, political events and other topics. The company said it streamed 600 hours of NFL games, political debates and other content to 31 million viewers in the fourth quarter.
