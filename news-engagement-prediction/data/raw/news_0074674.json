(PTI) The demonetisation of Rs 500-1000 notes has hardly altered the dominance of cash in the economy, and digital transactions have remained where they were. Prime minister Narendra Modi needs to pursue a government-supported plan to make digital transactions more convenient than cash, instead of claiming success when there is still little to show.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi said in his Mann-ki-Baat on Sunday that, “In the recent days, one can see a lot of emphasis being laid on Digi-Dhan. Gradually, people are shedding their hard currency mindset and moving towards digital currency. Digital transactions in India are witnessing a very rapid surge. The younger generation, in particular, is getting habituated to digital payments through its mobile handsets. I believe this to be a good portent”.\nPM Modi is obviously indicating that the demonetisation of old Rs 500-1,000 notes announced on November 8, which continued till December 31, and the government efforts in the last two months to promote digital payments have started yielding good results.\nJuxtapose his statement with the transaction data in the last few months and it can be easily seen that not much has changed on the ground.\nWatch this also:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T03:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T16:13:10.250+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
