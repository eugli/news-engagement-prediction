If he had evidence that Malaysia was colluding with hidden hands, he should provide the evidence instead of ranting away. \nBoth Foreign Minister Anifah Aman and Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak also deserve the credit for standing up and defending the police investigation into the case. \nThe North Korean ambassador should not be lecturing Malaysia on human rights, when North Korea itself is known for poor human rights protection. \nIn fact, it was wrong for him to demand that the body be released to the North Korean government instead of the next-of-kin, not to mention that he should not even object to any post-mortem being carried out by the Malaysian authorities, since this crime took place in Malaysia. \nFor the rest of this story and more, subscribe for only RM150 a year.
