Jose Luis Villegas jvillegas@sacbee.com 1 of 3 i \nBy Anita Chabria \nA 28-year-old parolee was shot multiple times during a gun battle with law enforcement Friday afternoon in North Sacramento, according to police. \nAround 2 p.m. in the 2900 block of Del Paso Boulevard, a Sacramento police officer and a Sacramento County Sheriff’s deputy approached the suspect after monitoring him as a dangerous parolee at large, said Sacramento police spokesman Sgt. Bryce Heinlein. The man drew a handgun and then fired at a K-9 unit. \nThree Sacramento police officers and the Sheriff’s deputy returned fire, striking the man multiple times. The suspect was shot and transported to the hospital, where he is in stable condition, Heinlein said. \nPolice are planning to send a robot into a house at the crime scene to ensure that no active threats remain, Heinlein said. \nA witness, Margo Santana, said she is in an adjacent house and can hear children from the house under surveillance. Heinlein said he could not confirm that children or any suspect remained in the house. \nThe nearby area has been locked down, and police advise motorists to avoid the area. \nHagginwood Elementary School on Palo Verde Street placed themselves on lockdown as a precaution, said Zenobia Gerald, Twin Rivers Unified School District spokeswoman. She said school officials are releasing students on a class by class basis. \nHagginwood Elementary parents have been notified about the lockdown and will be called when they can pick up students. \nReturn to sacbee.com for updates. \nDiana Lambert and Cathy Locke contributed to this report.
