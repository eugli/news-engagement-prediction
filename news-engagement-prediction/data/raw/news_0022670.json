CHRISTEL YARDLEY/FAIRFAX NZ \nThe sign, at Town & Country Food on Hamilton's Victoria Street, was put up by management after refunds were sought for food. \n\"They refuse to leave, but we don't swap,\" manager Bophal Chan said. \nREAD MORE: \nTroubled no further, staff have put the sign away. CHRISTEL YARDLEY/FAIRFAX NZ \nLindsay Evans has been on the streets for 11 years, and thinks people are better off not giving beggars money. \nCampaigns around the country have sought to dissuade the public from giving money to beggars, but what about food? \nLindsay Evans has lived on the streets for 11 years and has heard of people trying to trade food for cash. \nWhile he's never begged, he has received food from members of the public. \n\"I reckon it's acceptable … but the best bet from my experience is to ask them first.\" \nThose looking to give food should make sure it's actually sought. Evans has been given food that tastes like \"muck\". \nFor instance, he can't stand mince and cheese pies. \"I just biff it.\" \nGood-hearted members of the public should care about where their generosity leads, he said. \n\"It's not necessarily a good idea to give money to beggars … you don't know what they're going to spend it on.\" \nHamilton Central Business Association, in conjunction with Hamilton City Council, launched a \"Your Help May Harm\" campaign in late 2016 to spread the same message. \nAssociation general manager Vanessa Williams said giving money or food wasn't the right approach for people looking to help. \n\"It is to educate the public in the best way to help somebody, which is not giving money or food, but actually helping them tap into services.\" \nThe campaign aims to educate the public on the challenges of giving money to people on the street, encouraging people to direct those in need towards help. \nWilliams said they put up posters and council's CitySafe employees handed out information to the public. \n\"It's still receiving positive anecdotal feedback ... the general public seems not to be giving money to the people begging,\" she said. \nPeter Humphreys, manager of Hamilton Christian Night Shelter, said most people he knew would be appreciative of the food. \n\"It would be one in a blue moon that would actually take the food back, they would scoff it I'm sure.\" \nThat said, there were better ways the public could approach such situations. \n\"There's meals around town most days during the week ... if they wanted to give something to somebody, maybe give it to one of the churches. \n\"At least then it would definitely get to the right people, there won't be that issue of taking it back to the shop.\" \nHe's a long-standing advocate against giving money to beggars, which causes trouble. \n\"The guys that stay at the shelter who go out begging do go spend it on alcohol, and then I have to turn them away from the shelter, and then they're unsafe.\" \nProviding information to services and available meals is more useful than other offers of generosity, he said. \n\"It's not just telling people not to give, it's also educating the people that are on the streets.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T06:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:59:18.559+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
