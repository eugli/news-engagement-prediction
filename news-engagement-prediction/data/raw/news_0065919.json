A video surfaced that showed Yiannopoulos made comments defending acts of pedophilia, and he says he stepped down in order to remove his own wrong doings from the conversation about Breitbart as a whole. \nIf only that were the only unfortunate thing in Yiannopoulos' life. Turns out he's got a real wicked personal logo as well. His resignation memo showed that black-and-white, angular monstrosity to the world, and Twitter is having quite a time poking fun at its expense. It does look like a cliché dubstep or metal logo, and some people find even more harrowing visuals hidden inside. Check it out for yourself.
