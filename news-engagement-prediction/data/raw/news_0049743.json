But the couple is calling a truce, for the sake of their 6 children. The ex couple released a joint statement late last night which will seemingly end the back-and-forth drama in their Hollywood divorce. “The parties and their counsel have signed agreements to preserve the privacy rights of their children and family by keeping all court documents confidential and engaging a private judge to make any necessary legal decisions and to facilitate the expeditious resolution of any remaining issues,” the statement said. “The parents are committed to act as a united front to effectuate recovery and reunification.” Basically this means the couple is going work together, but it also means we won’t be in the loop going forward, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing for the couple. This new statement comes after a judge initially denied Brad’s request for privacy in his custody battle. Last month the actor asked for the custody documents to be sealed, but they were not. Angelina’s lawyers felt Brad only wanted to protect himself and not the childrens’ well-being.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T09:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:12:17.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
