Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nYou know someone’s hit a nerve when those attending GOP town halls start carrying signs reading, “Unpaid Protester,” and listing their ZIP codes to prove they are, indeed, constituents. Why do that, unless of course there were mounting suspicion that the overflow crowds at nearly every Republican town hall were organized and bussed in. \nNot that they’re necessarily lying; as we’ve said before, being part of an organized protest doesn’t always entail getting paid — if the public is willing to organize under and abide by the instructions in the Indivisible Town Hall Reference Guide for free, all the better. Leaked Audio Reveals Anti-Trump Forces Manufacturing Hostile Town Hall https://t.co/HhalC4QwSu pic.twitter.com/moRhB4O2vo \n— The Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) February 27, 2017 \nThe Daily Caller on Monday reported on leaked audio revealing activists with anti-Trump group Indivisible helping coordinate an effort to manufacture a hostile environment at Sen. Bill Cassidy’s town hall in Louisiana Friday: \nThe audio, obtained by local radio station KPEL, reveals a coordinated effort to create the public impression that Cassidy’s support for Trump is unpopular with his constituents. \n… \nThe activists split up into an “inside team” — tasked with occupying “as many seats as we can” and an “outside team,” whose job was to “give [the media] the coverage they want” before joining the others inside. Activists were instructed to dress like conservatives and leave at home “any signifier that you’re a liberal” in order to blend in with constituents. \nKPEL identified James Proctor, one voice heard on the recording, as the leader of Indivisible Acadiana, “a local branch of the national Indivisible organization, which has organized hostile Republican town halls all around the country.” \nIndivisible describes itself as a group of former congressional staffers, and they’ve teamed up with other insiders like Robert Reich and his Inequality Media.
