The Sandiganbayan is a special court that deals exclusively with corruption cases against government officials and employees. Rappler file photo \nMANILA, Philippines – The Sandiganbayan issued arrest orders against Ozamiz City Mayor Reynado Parojinog Sr and his daughter who also serves as his vice mayor, Nova Princess Parojinog-Echavez, in relation to graft charges filed against them. \nThe Sandiganbayan found \"probable cause\" that they committed conflict of interest when they awarded a government contract to a family-owned company. \n“The Court is convinced that the prosecution presented ample evidence to support a finding of probable cause hence the accused must be arrested and brought to trial,” the Sandiganbayan said in a 7-page ruling released Tuesday, January 31. \nThe Parojinog and Sons Construction Company, which was listed in the mayor's Statement of Assets Liabilities and Net Worth (SALN), won the government contract to renovate the city's Ramiro Gymnasium. \nThe vice mayor serves as the company's managing partner. \nSandiganbayan Associate Justice Maria Theresa Mendoza-Arcega, in a ruling issued January 31, said probable cause exists. She said the company should have been disqualified outright. \nShe denied the defendants’ motion seeking dismissal of the complaint. Associate Justices Roland Jurado and Rafael Lagos concurred with Mendoza-Arcega. \nThe Parojinogs argued, however, that the prohibition against relatives of sitting executive officers winning government contracts was not yet in place when the project was awarded in 2008. \nThey said the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9184 or the Government Procurement Reform Act only took effect on September 2, 2009. \nThe father-and-daughter tandem was also previously linked by President Rodrigo Duterte to illegal drugs trade. The vice mayor has a romantic relationship with alleged drug lord and Bilibid inmate Herbert Colanggo. – Rappler.com HOW  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T12:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T08:21:08.758+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
