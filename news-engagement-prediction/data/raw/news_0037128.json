Emelianenko will headline Bellator 172 when he squares off against Ultimate Fighting Championship veteran Matt Mitrione and plenty of fireworks are expected. At Friday’s official weigh-ins, both men looked calm, focused and as solid as ever. Mitrione, who has won two straight since singing with Bellator, was the first of the featured fighters to weigh in and “Meathead” looked as ready as ever at the scale. Mitrione confidently strode to the stage and came in at 257.5 pounds, setting the stage for what will be the biggest fight of his career thus far. Emelianenko, meanwhile, has been in the center of the biggest stage of the sport on many occasions. The former Pride Fighting Championships heavyweight champion has taken on -- and beaten -- a who’s who of the heavyweight division when it was at its greatest. Though he’s no longer in his fighting prime, “The Last Emperor” is a living legend and was statuesque as ever on Friday; Emelianenko weighed in at 236. Bellator 172 will be televised live on Spike beginning at 9 p.m. ET/6 p.m. PT. The prelims will be streamed live on Sherdog.com at 6:45 p.m. ET .
