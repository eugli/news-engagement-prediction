He said he had hoped to see Trudeau bring in a similar system in Canada.\n\"I wanted to believe him, and I did,\" he said. \"I am very disappointed.\"\n\"People feel that they have been cheated. Politicians walk back on their words,\" Vogt added. \"And Mr. Trudeau should know that we will not take this sitting down. That we will stand up, and we will march, and we will be visible and we will be loud. And we will remind him that promises are to be kept.\"\nSharon Bider of Toronto said she was devastated when Trudeau reneged on his promise to change the electoral system.\n\"I understand that there's a lot of turmoil right now, but that didn't justify shutting the system down and shutting the options down,\" she said.\nShe says she believed the prime minister when he said that 2015 would be the last election that used the first-past-the-post system.\nBut Trudeau has defended his decision by saying that Canadians haven't expressed a clear preference for electoral reform -- let alone a consensus.\nToronto's protest was one of more than 20 planned for Saturday across Canada, from Antigonish, N.S., to Victoria.\nIn Vancouver, dozens of people gathered in front of the Vancouver Art Gallery, chanting \"we want PR.\"\nRelated Stories Trudeau defends 'turning back' on electoral reform promise Liberal MPs admit government broke electoral reform pledge", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T01:32:53.162+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
