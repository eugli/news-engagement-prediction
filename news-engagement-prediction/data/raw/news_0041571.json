This launch was rescheduled to Sunday after being scrubbed on Saturday due to concerns over the rocket's steering system.\nIt was also SpaceX's first launch from Florida since a rocket explosion last September.\nSpaceX  readies for its fastest launch pace with new Florida site The nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force Station pad where  SpaceX  had been launching its Falcon 9 rockets was damaged  during the fuelling accident . The company expects to return the facility to service later this year after repairs.\nA SpaceX cargo ship was supposed to be launched Saturday, but the company postponed until Sunday, successfully using NASA's 39A launchpad in Florida, where NASA's astronauts once took off for space missions. (Gene Blevins/Reuters)\nIn its place, the seaside Launch Complex 39A from which astronauts once blasted off for the moon was revitalized thanks to the commercial space venture founded by tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, owner of Space Exploration Technologies Corp. \nNASA leased the so-called Apollo pad to  Elon  Musk's company in 2014.\n\"We are honoured to be allowed to use it,\" Musk said in a tweet noting its historic significance.\nSpaceX  blast a 'most difficult, complex failure' For its Kennedy Space Center debut,  SpaceX  launched a cargo ship to the space station for NASA and has several commercial satellite flights planned through the spring.\nSpaceX  has a  backlog of more than 70 missions  worth more than $10 billion.\nWithin about two years, the company expects to add human  spaceflight  to its launch services. The U.S. space agency has hired  SpaceX  and Boeing Co. to ferry astronauts to the space station, breaking a Russian monopoly in effect since the shuttles were retired.\nFor human  spaceflight ,  SpaceX  will need to build up  39A's  launch tower and hang a new walkway so astronauts can access the Crew Dragon spaceship, said Stephen Payne, NASA's launch integration manager for the Commercial Crew program.\n'Not just a dream':  Elon  Musk aims to get humans on Mars within 10 years \n\n\nWith files from The Associated Press Â© Thomson Reuters, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T17:57:58.379+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
