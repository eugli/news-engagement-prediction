Oh, great.' Ed then walked into the radio studio and joined the broadcast. Poor love: Katy's hit single Chained to the Rhythm was narrowly beaten to the top spot by Ed's ballad Shape of You, prompting the jokey outburst Moving on: Katy didn't seem too worried about things when she was pictured at the BRITs Universal afterparty in London on Wednesday night The 26-year-old then spoke about the first time he met Katy. He said: 'I played a gig in Toronto and I was sweating so bad and then I saw Katy on the side of the stage and I was like, \"Oh, God. Katy Perry’s here! This is really embarrassing. I’m really sweaty. \"I walked up to her and she was like, ‘Hi. I would hug you, but ew.\" Katy, determined not to be outdone, fired back: 'And now that you’re Ed Sheeran, it’s like, ‘Put your ball s*** on me!’ It’s like, ‘All of it!’' Wow: At the BRITs Katy ensured she stole the spotlight in a cool and sophisticated silk suit that showed off her legs Fun-filled set: During the ceremony she also took to the stage to perform. And the pop princess was in her element thanks to her quirky staging, which included a sea of houses All round the houses: Katy literally brought the house down as she performed her new track Woman of the hour: Katy may have missed out on the number one spot, but she had a fantastic night at the BRITs later on which no doubt made up for the incident The songstress seemed to be having a great time after crossing the Atlantic. But during her anti-Trump performance at the BRIT awards, one of Katy's house-shaped backing dancers fell off the stage into the crowd, instantly prompting memes and hilarious comments on the internet. But the star didn't seem too bothered later on that night as she partied with a star-studded crowd. She bopped to Nick Grimshaw's slick DJ tunes with close friend Ellie Goulding at the A-list Universal BRITs after party on Wednesday night. Flashing her tanned and toned pins, Ellie donned a pair of black court heels, whilst a pair of dazzling diamond earrings and a choker injected some glitz into the ensemble. What a gent: Ed Sheeran was barefoot when he left Warner Music's Brits afterparty hand-in-hand with Cherry Seaborn on Wednesday, after giving her his shoes Best behaviour: Ed was playing it sensible on Wednesday night, as he hit Warner Music's Brits afterparty with girlfriend Cherry On the same night, Ed Sheeran proved he is not only winning musically but is a true gentleman. The singer recently revealed he is madly in love with his girlfriend, Cherry Seaborn, hinting that she may even be marriage material. And the star was even prepared to walk over hot coals for high school sweetheart Cherry Seaborn - to an extent - as he offered up his shoes and left a party barefoot, when she broke her heels at the Brits on Wednesday night. Good boy: Ed was just wearing his socks after giving up his shoes for his girl after her £1395 Andaloulou shoes broke on the night The chivalrous 25-year-old saved Cherry's feet by letting her wear his trainers after they danced so hard inside Warner Music's London bash that she snapped her £1395 Andaloulou Nappa Christian Louboutin boots. Ed escorted his lady friend out of the venue by the hand, putting his feet carefully in front of each other, protected in nothing but black socks. In his other hand, Ed carried the broken pair of shoes that had a towering heel limply swinging at the red soles. Broken: Ed was kind enough to give the beauty his own shoes, instead Proud Cherry, meanwhile, looked comfortable to the artist's too-big trainers and shot a gleeful smile as she followed him out. MailOnline has contacted a spokesperson for Christian Louboutin for comment. It was a more reserved appearance for Ed, who has not yet lived down those drunken pictures from the Brit Awards 2015. Well heeled: The musician was prepared to walk over hot coals for Cherry Could she be the one? He has recently said that this relationship feels like marriage material What a guy: The shoes had snapped almost clean off at the heel Ed was determined to avoid adding to the online collection of unfortunate stumbling snaps that night, when he kept a low profile at the Warner bash. The hitmaker was on his best behaviour after he was propped up on his way to taxi, leaving The Box nightclub on the same night, two years ago. Ed - who skipped the Brits in 2016 during a year out of the industry - had been the top performer on the night, with his hotly anticipated Shape Of You performance bolstered by a surprise appearance from Stormzy. Too much dancing? The brunette had scratches on her knees, hinting that she may have fallen Quite a contrast: The same can not be said of the same event two years ago, when Ed left the afterparty looking worse for wear The musician even paid tribute to his collaborator later that evening by sporting a T-shirt with the grime artist's stage name on the front. Ed and Cherry were just two of the high profile guests to arrive at Warner Music's bash on Wednesday night, also joining Brooklyn Beckham and Abbey Clancy. And even when they piled back into a taxi on top of each other, after the afterparty, Ed seemed poised. It was quite a contrast to the pictures of Ed stumbling to the taxi in February 2015, escorted and propped up by his security team. Propped up: The redhead needed to be propped up by security Ed was the biggest winner of the night in 2015, walking away with two of the four Brit Awards he was nominated for. He was named the best British solo artist and also took home the coveted best album prize for his second studio album, 'X'. Ed referenced the embarrassing pictures when he chatted to Radio 1 DJ Nick, earlier that day, hinting that it would not be a repeat performance, this year. Easy does: He'd been the big winner that night, taking home two of the four Brit Awards he was nominated for After all, chart topping Ed was due to fly to Germany first thing on Thursday morning. Rising at 8am the next day, chirpy Ed wrote: 'Last night was so much fun. Love to @Stormzy1 for the performance.' 'Off to Germany now X' he added, as he announced a trip to the European country one months ahead of tour dates in Munich, Mannheim, Cologne, Hamburg and Berlin. This year, Ed was not nominated because 2016 was not a music-making year for Ed, who travelled the world instead. Heading home: They called it an early night, climbing into a taxi with a giggle Heading home: The loved-up pair seemed to have had a fun night out On arrival: Ed was due to fly to Germany the next morning for work During that time, Ed rekindled his relationship with a crush he first knew from school, Cherry. When asked if his relationship with Cherry has the potential to be a 'marriage thing', Ed recently told Australian radio show The Kyle and Jackie O Show: 'I'm pretty... yeah I feel pretty good about it.' Ed also confessed he'd 'love' to start a family with his old school pal - who he's previously called 'The One' adding: 'Yeah, potentially. I would like some kids.' On the same subject, he also told Zane Lowe recently he was, 'massively' keen: 'I wanted to be a dad, like, last year. 'I'm ready, let's go - tour bus babies, little fat, chubby babies that just walk around.'
