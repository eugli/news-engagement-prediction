Including a 5.1-inch 1080p display, and 5.5-inch QHD displays respectively. The Kirin 960 processor on board along with 4GB of RAM. It’s definitely a high-end but smaller smartphone from the Chinese manufacturer. And the device also sports their dual-camera setup, something that they first debuted on the P9 last year in London. This is a Leica-branded dual-camera setup and it’s something that won’t be going away anytime soon, especially since the two companies have started their own R&D facility in Germany for smartphone camera modules. \nThis camera setup is basically the same as the Huawei Mate 9’s from last year. Where you get a 12-megapixel color or RGB sensor, and then a 20-megapixel monochrome sensor which also works for taking 20-megapixel color pictures. You still get all of the same features, like bokeh, allowing you to get a blurred background with the object in the foreground being in focus. Huawei actually brought in a new form of bokeh, this time for monochrome. So not only can you take black and white photos naturally (read: without a filter) but you can also add a bokeh effect to them. \nThe front-facing camera on the Huawei P10 is actually a 8-megapixel Leica sensor. Huawei is touting it as the first Leica selfie camera on a smartphone. So expect to see some great selfies taken with the front-facing camera on both the P10 and P10 Plus. Given the fact that Leica is already well-known for putting out some incredible cameras, it’s no surprise that their front-facing camera on the P10 and P10 Plus is pretty incredible. \nThe Huawei P10 and the P10 Plus should be available in the coming weeks, although Huawei has not yet mentioned when the device will be available. It shouldn’t be long before it’s available, and it’ll likely be coming to Asia and Europe before North America. Huawei has also not announced pricing for the P10 or the P10 Plus just yet, but that will likely depend on the region, as it does with most smartphones these days.
