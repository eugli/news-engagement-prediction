The Hammer Museum was so inundated with requests for the caftans from their Made in L.A. exhibit that the museum began producing them for sale in their gift shop .\nGet creative with your layering, accessorize with your favorite pink hat , and you’re ready for the next Women’s March.\nDuring #MadeinLA2016 we got so many comments asking if Huguette Caland’s caftans could be purchased. We heard you, and now they can! Caland’s caftans were such a hit during Made in L.A. that we decided to produce three different versions—based on three of the artist’s caftans—and sell them in the Hammer Store. — One of three children born to the first president of Lebanon following the end of the French mandate, Caland went on to study painting at the American University in Beirut before moving to Paris in 1970. The influence of the city and her proximity to its artistic life led to new breakthroughs within an artistic practice still undergoing a process of maturation. Caland often wore caftans of her own design, which foregrounded the artist’s own relationship to the erotics of the female form. Set against a backdrop of the feminist art movements that emerged concurrently, works such as these take into consideration the politics of representing female sexuality and desire, an interest that Caland mapped onto her own body and introduced to her immediate surroundings. #FridayFinds #HuguetteCaland \nA photo posted by Hammer Museum (@hammer_museum) on Feb 3, 2017 at 11:06am PST \nTags: the revolution will wear a caftan caftans that caftan life Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories Neiman Marcus Has Also Dropped Ivanka Trump’s Line Selena Gomez Teased Fans with New Music on Instagram Kesha Speaks Out Against Online Bullying in New PSA Most Viewed Stories Something About This Photo Sure Feels Familiar People Are Taking to Twitter to Show Trump What It Really Means to Dress Like a Woman We Finally Know How Gabrielle Union Ages Slower Than Everyone Else Should I Be Drinking Kombucha?
