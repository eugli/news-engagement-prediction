The streaming service released the debut date and the above cast photo on Wednesday.\nAlong with the original creator, Joel Hodgson, actors Felicia Day and Patton Oswalt are notably suited up in this new preview.\nDay posted the below photo from the premiere:\nHaven't been out since the baby but had to make the MST3k premiere! Show will be out on Netflix in April woot! pic.twitter.com/JcwA1MIMXc\n— Felicia Day (@feliciaday) February 22, 2017 The return of “MST3K” follows the Netflix revivals of projects such as “Gilmore Girls,” “Wet Hot American Summer,” “Degrassi,” “Full House,” “Arrested Development” and “Mr. Show.”\nPresumably, this crew of comedians will be able to revitalize the former format of riffing on older movies, as they could make jokes about the many titles within Netflix’s domain.\nThese new episodes were at least partly funded by a Kickstarter created by Hodgson. The show raised over $2.5 million in 2015 to help get to this point.\nALSO ON HUFFPOST 2016 Movies Available On Netflix 2016 Movies Available On Netflix 1 of 12 \"The Jungle Book\" Hollywood's bloated franchise obsession is running thin , but Disney's live-action reboots of its animated classics keep getting better. 2016 brought us \"The Jungle Book\" and \"Pete's Dragon,\" two surprisingly meditative takes on orphan boys surviving in the wilderness with their animal pals. Netflix recently signed a deal to acquire Disney's new releases, so \"The Jungle Book\" has already hit the streaming service. Boot up Jon Favreau's majestic adventure -- featuring the voice work of Idris Elba, Lupita Nyong'o, Scarlett Johansson and Christopher Walken -- for a beautifully rendered take on the bare necessities of life.
