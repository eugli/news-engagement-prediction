Over the past six seasons #AmericanHorrorStory has had us reaching for the cushion (and sometimes the tissues) with its cocktail of #horror and sex. So far we have seen bestiality, incest, necrophilia, and even the token gimp suit as our cast of sexed-up actors have written the world's weirdest Kama Sutra. As we head into the seventh season, and a proposed election theme , will we see an infamous blue suit with white markings, or will #RyanMurphy go for something a little more subtle? \nForget Ron Jeremy and move over Christian Grey, AHS has you licked in the sex stakes; literally putting the f*ck in WTF, just what are the 10 most messed up sex scenes in American Horror Story history? Lock the door, delete your browser history, and change the sheets, because here we go: 1. Jimmy's Tupperware Party - 'Freak Show' 'American Horror Story' [Credit: FX] \nPlastic and fantastic tupperware parties may seem like something from a bygone era, but the fourth season of Horror Story made them relevant again, while bringing a whole new meaning to the word sausage fingers. You may remember that Evan Peters played Jimmy \"Lobster Boy\" Darling, a man whose girthy appendage came north of the border. Instead of languishing as a \"freak,\" Jimmy decided to make some cash on the side off the Bree Van De Kamp's of this world. \nIt wasn't quite keys in the bowl, but under the guise of a tupperware party, Darling would pleasure curious housewives who were dissatisfied in the bedroom. His fantastic flippers seemed to keep the suburbanites pretty happy until their gruesome farewell. Later in the series, the vicious Dandy Mott slaughtered the housewives at said tupperware party and blamed Jimmy for their murders. I'm sure Jimmy was VERY popular in jail. 2. Leo and Teresa - 'Asylum' 'American Horror Story' [Credit: FX] \nEveryone likes to be a bit adventurous in the bedroom, but a honeymoon tour of murder sites hardly seems like nature's viagra. If banging amongst cobwebs and tuberculosis sufferers is your thing, roll on up to the disused Briarcliff Manor to give you a woody. \nAdam Levine's guest spot on Asylum was nowhere near as illustrious as his music career and he barely had time to get to the \"Payphone\" before he was caused a whole load of \"Misery\" by Bloody Face. After ploughing wife Theresa on an operating table, Leo became a cropper when Bloody Face ripped his arm off in the abandoned cells of the asylum. Leo and Teresa managed to defeat the masked killer, only to be gunned down by two more Bloody Faces on the steps of the Briarcliff — if they'd stuck to missionary, none of this would've happened! 3. Zoe and Coma Kid - 'Coven' 'American Horror Story' [Credit: FX] \nIf you thought Jess Weixler in the film Teeth was dangerous, check out Taissa Farmiga's vagina of death from Coven . Similar to Rogue in the X-Men films, the character of Zoe's powers included sucking the life out of those she touched without meaning to — think of it as a sexually charged Midas Touch. \nIf flipping a bus full of chauvinistic frat boys weren't bad enough, Farmiga and Emma Roberts headed to the hospital to finish the job and cover their tracks as witches. Knowing that the surviving comatose boy would blow their coven cover, Zoe straddled the unconscious lad and lets her poison pussy do the rest. He gratefully blew his load, but unfortunately that was the contents of what was inside his skull, all over the pillow. 4. Queenie and Bastien - 'Coven' 'American Horror Story' [Credit: FX] \nFeeling horny? Well, you won't be after watching Queenie's run-in with a minotaur. The voodoo doll witch didn't have an easy run of it: The victim of Madam LaLaurie's racist slurs, Queenie was then subjected to some grisly beastiality — you can only imagine that Murphy had watched that video of the woman and the horse. After Marie Laveau cursed the Coven house, she sent her former lover Bastien to seek justice on Delphine LaLaurie for fusing a bull's head onto him in her attic of horrors. \nQueenie decided to step in, but it looked like she had an ulterior motive to help pop her cherry. As soon as Gabourey Sidibe uttered the words, \"You just wanted love, and that makes you a beast,\" we knew she was in trouble. Bludgeoned to within an inch of her life, it seemed that the rampant Bastien hadn't let his transformation into a minotaur dampen his lust. Although Queenie survived, the hapless virgin was ravaged by the beast and left for dead in Cordelia's potting shed. 5. The Countess and Donovan - 'Hotel' 'American Horror Story' [Credit: FX] \nThe (razor) gloves were literally off from the get-go with Hotel thanks to vampires and vaginas. Season 5 kicked off with a veritable orgy of blood, set to \"She Wants Revenge's \"Tear You Apart\" it was a scene that was dripping with blood and other fluids when Matt Bomer and Gaga set themselves as the season's golden couple — it was a vampiric orgy that created their own 50 Shades of Twilight . Not only was John Travolta on set to watch (he was filming next door for American Crime Story ), but Gaga reportedly wanted to get even more raunchy than the final cut: \n\"She showed up and she was wearing diamond pasties, a Band-Aid on her hoo-ha, heels, and a black veil that Alexander McQueen made for her on the day before his death. Then the crew gasped in delight and we were off!” \nAlthough Hotel was one of the more maligned seasons, audiences rightly became obsessed with Gaga and an eyeliner-wearing Matt Bomer. Eat your heart our R. Patz and K. Stew. \nSee also: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T00:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:19:19.534+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
