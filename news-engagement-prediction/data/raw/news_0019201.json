There's the ice cream queens at Ginger's Comfort Emporium , the dessert bar Milk Jam and the new kid on the block Fireworks in Altrincham. \nBut there's a new troupe of American-style diners that are hoping to trump the lot, with their outrageous portion sizes, Willy Wonka-esque ingredients, and myriad flavour combinations. \nCreams Cafe is a franchise with stores across the UK, and Manchester is next on the list. \nThe Manchester based SB Group will bring a total of four dessert bars to the city, said a representative of the company, and two of those are nearly ready to open. \nThe first is based in 1, Portland Street, adjacent to Piccadilly Gardens. Seating over 100, the huge new unit will be ready open early next month. \nThe second in Cheetham Hill Shopping Centre on Bury Road is slightly larger at 3,000 sq foot, and will feature a soft-play area when it opens in April.

The fourth site is yet to be confirmed, and the SB Group are looking to open in Liverpool, too. \nAll the stores will serve the Creams Cafe signature menu, which includes pancakes, sundaes, freakshakes, coffees, and waffles. \nDiners can choose from dishes such as the Rocher waffle (£6.75) - a freshly made waffle base topped with Ferrero Rocher ice cream, vanilla ice cream, milk chocolate flakes, real Ferrero Rochers and a luxury milk chocolate syrup. Creams Cafe in Rickmansworth \nOr indulge in the Oreo Sundae (£.5.95) - a mixture of creamy vanilla, cookies and cream ice cream with chocolate syrup topped with crushed Oreo cookies, cream, and chocolate flakes. \nMilkshake flavours include Kinder Bueno, Milky Bar, Skittles, Twix, Snickers and Bounty, and cost between £3.50 and £3.95. \nVisit creamscafe.com for more information.
