The movie is nominated for two awards at the 2017 Oscars . \nWhen asked how nervous he gets while singing, Johnson told E! News' Ryan Seacrest on the red carpet at the event Sunday that on a scale of 1 to 10, he's a 12. His cure? Tequila. \n\"Not a tequila,\" he said. \"Several. Plural.\" Photos \nOscars 2017 Red Carpet Arrivals \nHis Moana co-stars Lin-Manuel Miranda , creator of the Broadway smash hit Hamilton , and 16-year-old Auli'i Cravalho , who made her big screen debut by portraying the title character in the film, are set to perform another one of the movie's songs, \"How Far I'll Go,\" which is nominated for Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures (Original Song). The film is also nominated for Best Animated Feature Film. \n\"Lin-Manuel is such a genius and a master,\" Johnson told Seacrest. \"It was amazing.\" \n\"I've sung in the past, and in Polynesian culture, we sing, we dance, we play ukulele or guitar, things like that—but not to this level,\" the actor told E! News' Erin Lim several months ago. \"It's Disney, and there's music involved. In a way, it's a musical. There's a lot of pressure ...But I had the best time—really, the best time.\" \nThe actor walked the Oscars red carpet with his partner, Lauren Hashian .
