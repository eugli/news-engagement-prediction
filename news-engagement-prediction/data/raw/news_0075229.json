As is always the case when new devices are introduced, we’re most curious on exactly when they will be launched in Malaysia. Well, the P10 and P10 Plus will very likely be launched on our shores as early as next month. \nThis announcement came from none other than Richard Yu himself, the CEO of Huawei. At the launch event of the P10 and P10 Plus, Yu revealed that Malaysia is part of the first wave launch markets for the new smartphones. In retrospect, this is actually expected of Huawei; after all, Malaysia was one of the first countries to get the Huawei Mate 9 Pro and Porsche Design Mate 9 . \nIn terms of specifications, the P10 is packed with a 5.1-inch 1080p IPS display, a Kirin 960 processor paired with 4GB of RAM, 64GB of expandable storage, a Leica-branded 20MP + 12MP dual-camera system with optical image stabilisation, an 8MP front-facing camera – also with the Leica branding – as well as a 3,200mAh battery. \nAs the bigger device of the two, the P10 Plus also features higher-end hardware. These include a sharper 5.5-inch 1440p IPS display, up to 6GB of RAM, two choices of internal storage (64GB and 128GB), similar camera configuration as the P10 – the rear camera has a larger f/1.8 aperture, however – and a sizeable 3,750mAh battery.

Although the Malaysian pricing of these devices have not been revealed yet, we were told that they would be similar to their predecessors’ pricing structure. 2 1 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T14:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T03:38:05.839+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
