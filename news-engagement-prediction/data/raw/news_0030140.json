Article continues below \nIn arguably the biggest talking point of the first half, Josh King and many of those watching on at the Vitality Stadium thought the hosts had pulled level when the Cherries' forward was found unmarked in the box. \nKing's one-touch finish past Cabellero looked like a perfectly good goal at first, however, it was only his immediate muted celebrations that suggested it had been disallowed. Article continues below \nLike everyone else, our first suspicions was that King was offside when the ball was played in from the right-hand side. \nBut there was a slight problem, the assistant referee hadn't actually flagged - prompting even more confusion. \nIt eventually became clear that referee Neil Swarbrick had ruled the goal out because King pulled back John Stones before the cross was delivered to get ahead of the centre-back. \nReplays showed it was actually perfectly good decision and yet no one knows exactly how Swarbrick came to make that call. \nAs you can see in the video below, the official is actually looking at the ball when the offence is committed so how he knew Stones had been pulled back is anyone's guess. \nIt certainly had a few people on Twitter left feeling puzzled. Here are some of the best tweets: \nGuess it shouldn't really matter how referees make their decisions, as long as they get them right. \nIt won't make Bournemouth fans feel any better, though, as the Cherries continue to struggle in 2017. \nEddie Howe's side are yet to win since the turn of the year and appear to be getting ever closer to the relegation zone with each passing week. \nThey were also hit by injuries to Simon Francis and Jack Wilshere in the opening period, two players who will be crucial in their fight to stay in the Premier League. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
