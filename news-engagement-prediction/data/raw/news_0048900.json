Unfortunately, she doesn't make it through the procedure with her son Carl being the one to put a bullet to her head. 5/10 The Governor slays Hershel (season 4, episode 8) \nThe Governor makes his dramatic return for a showdown at the prison after he captures Michonne (Danai Gurira) and Hershel (Scott Wilson). Rick reaches out, attempting to reason with him - but The Governor starts a war when he proceeds to decapitate poor old Hershel instead. 6/10 \"Look at the flowers\" (season 4, episode 14) \nIn a standout episode from the show's fourth season, Carol is forced to take drastic measures when young teenager Lizzie murders her sister Mika in the belief that she'll live on as a zombie. Realising Lizzie's depraved mind would endanger those around her, Carol puts a gun to the young girl's head and, telling her to \"look at the flowers,\" pulls the trigger, fighting back the tears. 7/10 Carl's bullet to the eye (season 6, episode 9) \nSeason six returned from its mid-season break in typically dramatic fashion when an iconic moment from the graphic novels came to life: Carl takes a bullet to the eye. 8/10 Beth is killed (season 5, episode 8) \nUpon being kidnapped, Beth (Emily Kinney) is taken to Grady Memorial Hospital managed by Atlanta Law Enforcement.

Without expectation, he thwacks Lucille round the head of poor Glenn. With his eyeball popping out of his head, he manages: \"I'll find you, Maggie before Negan proceeds to finish the job ending the former pizza delivery boy's life. \nHe said: “We were shocked when we came face to face with a new t-shirt with a racially explicit graphic and text. \n“It was fantastically offensive and I can only assume that no-one in the process of ordering it knew what they were doing or were aware of its subliminal messages.” \nHe continued by claiming that the image “...relates directly to the practice of assaulting black people in America.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:12:53.842+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
