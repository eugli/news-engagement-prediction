We are not men dressed up as women, we are transgender women,” said Kalaivani.\nShe said such crude terms were used because of the general lack of respect for the transgender community.\nTransgender activist Nisha Ayub, in a Facebook posting, also criticised those who had used degrading terms to describe Sameera’s gender identity.\nNisha also talked about a local radio station, which had in its morning programme yesterday, referred to Sameera as a transgender man.\nNisha said the announcers, who were giggling, also said Sameera had “changed, was cute but yet was murdered”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:17:42.214+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
