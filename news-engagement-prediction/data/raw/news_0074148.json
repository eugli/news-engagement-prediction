Hyderabad: The Telangana State Pollution Control Board (TSPCB)’s official Air Quality Index (AQI) data for February 21, 2017 shows that the average pollution level at Sanathnagar is higher than at Delhi’s Siri Fort. Sanathnagar is one of six Ambient Air Quality monitoring stations (AAQMS) in Hyderabad.\nOn February 21, the AQI at Sanathnagar was 217(PM2.5) whereas in Siri Fort it was 214 (PM2.5). Sanathnagar falls in the ‘poor’ range where as all other areas in the city such as Hyderabad University, Zoo park, Bollaram, Pashamylaram and ISRISAT are recorded as ‘moderate’.\nAAQMS in Hyderabad and Delhi show a higher air quality index than those in other major metros such as Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata. Prolonged exposure to these higher levels of pollution can cause breathing discomfort to citizens residing and working in Sanath Nagar and nearby areas.\ninfographic\nEnvironmentalist Subba Rao says that Hyderabad is moving fast to become number one in pollution. “Higher levels of pollution at Sanathnagar are obvious as it’s the second oldest industrial estate after Azamabad.\nCities have become time bombs with increasing air pollution and garbage dumps due to which citizens are experiencing slow death. Cities need a disaster and crisis management plan to control the increasing pollution levels.\n\"We have a disaster management department for the state, and city also, but do we have a city disaster management plan?” he asks. The Telangana State Pollution Control Board (TSPCB) states that Sanathnagar’s poor air quality index is due to the many industries and increasing dust levels and vehicular pollution.\nTSPCB’s N Raveendhar says, “We submitted an action plan on January 11, 2017 which is yet to be approved. According to the action plan we are working with the transport department to intensify measures to check vehicular emissions since only 20 per cent of vehicles in the city have got their pollution checking done.\nThe action plan also aims to improve roads, parking, flyovers, laying roads with specialised technology and monitoring the use of plastic.''", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T11:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T09:43:36.782+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
