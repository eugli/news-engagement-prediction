Storm Doris is giving people a good excuse for a bad hair day \nThe tragic scene took place in Corby, Northamptonshire, as personal trainer Rebecca Redden got out of her car. \nIt’s not clear if Doris was trying to help Rebecca, 24, keep on track with her fitness regime, or whether she was just being sassy. \nThe only confirmed detail is that the box of 12 all ended up on the floor. And it was really sad. Rebecca almost cried at the scene (Picture: Rebecca Redden) @peachesfit NE officers feel ur pain #donutdown we apply #2secondrule give us location & we'll #seizeevidence drive safe 2day #stormdoris \n— Edinburgh North East (@EdinPolNE) February 23, 2017 \nSpeaking to Metro.co.uk , Rebecca said: ‘I got up super early so I could go and get some before work to surprise my colleague on her 40th birthday. \n‘I then shelled out nearly £14 and drove round the corner to work. \n‘As I opened the car door, the tray flew out of my hand. I was so gutted in nearly cried. \n‘I was hangry because I hadn’t had any breakfast yet and this was the last straw. \n‘None of them were saved. They were completely covered in grit. RIP.’ \nFollowing the tragedy, Rebecca took to Twitter to vent her upset and was met with dozens of condolence messages. \nOne person said: ‘I’m so sorry for your loss, my heart goes out to you and your family. Rest in peace sweet doughnuts.’ \nAnother said: ‘Oh the horror! Is there a fund we can donate to?’ \nBut the best response came from Edinburgh North East police force who said: ‘NE officers feel your pain #donutdown. We apply #twosecondrule, give us location & we’ll #seizeevidence. Drive safe 2day #StormDoris.’ Even personal trainers like doughnuts (Picture: Rebecca Redden) \nRebecca told Metro.co.uk : ‘I can’t really curse the name of storm Doris. My Nana’s name is Doris so it seems weird to curse it. \n‘However, I will say the devastation caused this morning has been life changing. \n‘I would also like to take this opportunity to appeal to the good will of Krispy Kreme. \n‘Help an impoverished fitness instructor out and send a replacement box.’ \nA total of 12 more doughnuts are set to arrive at Rebecca’s office later today.
