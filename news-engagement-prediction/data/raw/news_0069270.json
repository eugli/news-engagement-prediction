Is this something I can make up at home? \nWe're glad Bev wrote in because glycolic acid is a great product to incorporate into your skin care regimen and its origins are interesting. Read on to learn more about glycolic acid's skin benefits. What is glycolic acid? \nGlycolic acid is a natural ingredient derived from sugar cane, though it is now often made synthetically. It falls into a set of molecules known as AHA's , or Alpha Hydroxy Acids. There are five AHA's, which Dermatology Expert Dr. Heather Brannon describes as: glycolic acid (sugar cane), lactic acid (milk), citric acid (oranges and lemons), malic acid (apples and pears) and tartaric acids (grapes). \nGlycolic acid is the most common alpha hydroxy acid, and it has a reputation of being one of the safest forms of alpha hydroxy acids. Glycolic Acid Skin Benefits: \nGlycolic acid is an exfoliator. It safely removes the outer layer of dead skin cells on your skin, bringing fresh, new skin to the surface. This is beneficial for those who are looking for products that help with anti-aging. Glycolic acid can also help lighten discoloration of the skin, such as sun spots or age spots , and help those with acne-prone and blackhead-prone skin. \nIt's important to note that you should always wear sunscreen, even more so when you're using AHA's like glycolic acid, as your skin is much more susceptible to sunburn. Glycolic Acid Products: \nGlycolic acid products comes in many different forms: cleansers, serums, moisturizers, eye creams and facial peels. \nWhen you read a product's ingredient list, which you should always do, glycolic acid should be listed in the \"active ingredients\" section, above the product's full list of ingredients. Many times it will also appear as a percentage. Some skincare experts believe that products such as serums and creams with less than 10% strength don't really give your skin the benefits glycolic acid is known for, so make sure you look at the percentage. \nCombining glycolic acid products is okay to do, too, such as a 3% facial cleanser paired with a 10% serum. \nCheck out my favorite brands of glycolic acid skincare products available on Amazon.com:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:33:29.547+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
