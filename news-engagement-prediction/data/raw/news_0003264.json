And how do they compare to celebrity fees in previous series? Here’s what we know. Fame Flynet Spencer and Heidi, AKA Speidi, were reportedly been paid £570,000 between them to return to CBB Speidi aka Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt \nThey were the first pair to enter the CBB house as part of the ‘All Stars’ group, having previously been on the show in 2013 and coming in second to winner Rylan Clark. \nThe reality TV couple , who married in 2009, are reportedly earning £570,000 between them for their return stint on the show. Ray J 7 Kim K’s ex Ray J is believed to be the highest-paid CBB housemate so far \nFor the rapper’s first time in Celebrity Big Brother he was part of the ‘New Stars’ gang. \nBosses hoped he’d spill the beans about his relationship with Kim Kardashian so reportedly gave him £810,000- that’s $1million – for his appearance. \nThat would make him the highest-paid CBB housemate ever. Not only that, but according to TMZ, producers have also covered his £24,000 travel and hotel costs while he’s in the UK. \nHowever, his time in the show proved to be short-lived – Ray J left the show after a week in the house , after reportedly “blacking out” as a result of intense toothache which saw him rushed to hospital.
