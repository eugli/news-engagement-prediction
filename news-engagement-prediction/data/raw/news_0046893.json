The article, which was actually framed as a light-hearted slideshow, featured gifts like a “girl power” baseball cap to showcase you are “kind, smart and strong.” They also included an “F-Uterus” pin you can show off to the “rude jerks who ask if you regret your choice.” And, they advise young girls to volunteer as escorts at abortion clinics in a show of solidarity with their post-abortive friends. Take a look for yourself to see the rest of the disturbing gift ideas. \nUnfortunately, Teen Vogue probably won’t be willing to feature a different perspective — this one from a 16-year-old named Autumn. She is the demographic target of Teen Vogue , but clearly wise beyond her years — reminding viewers that there’s nothing light-hearted or celebratory about an abortion. \n“The point of the article was to make the situation seem as light hearted and nonchalant as possible in order to convince girls my age that abortion is not big deal. We need to clarify one thing — abortion is a big deal,” Autumn begins. \nWatch the video response below: \nLike more senior women’s magazines, Teen Vogue assumes that all of their female readers are supportive of the pro-choice agenda. Would they be brave enough to feature a a pro-life perspective from a strong, articulate young woman as well? I challenge them to do so.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:56:53.398+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
