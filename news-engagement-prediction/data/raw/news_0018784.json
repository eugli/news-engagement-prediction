An attorney for the trooper who shot Sykes did not respond to a message seeking comment. Gerald Sykes. Submitted photo \nThe July incident started when the troopers were dispatched to Sykes' single-family home on Centerton Road in Upper Deerfield, where they were told someone had made a 911 call and hung up. \nBut the state investigation later found there had been no hang-up. According to the report, a 911 caller reached a dispatch center in Cumberland County, and the dispatcher attempted to transfer the call to State Police. That dispatcher, however, \"hit a wrong button\" and sent the call to a 911 center in Vineland. \n\"The county dispatcher quickly canceled the transfer, but the dispatch terminal in Vineland registered a 911 call lasting just two seconds,\" the report said. \nThe Vineland dispatcher thought the two-second call was a hang-up because that facility is not equipped to handle 911 calls from cell phones, which are received by the county facility, authorities said. \nBecause the Sykes family lives near a cell phone tower, that dispatcher wrongly determined they had placed the call and contacted the State Police station in Bridgeton to report a 911 hang-up at their address. \nMeanwhile, Sykes and his wife told investigators they awoke, groggy, to a barking dog and the sound of footsteps on their deck. \nThe troopers arrived in uniform driving marked cars, but did not activate their lights or sirens, according to the report. The home was set back from the road and lit only by the headlights of the troop cars. \nOne trooper rang the doorbell of the home but got no response, the report said, so both troopers walked to the back of the house, where they could see the couple's bedroom through a sliding glass door. \nThe troopers saw Skyes' wife turn on a bedside light and get out of bed, and one of the troopers \"shouting through the glass, identified himself as a state trooper and said he was there to investigate a 911 hang-up,\" the report said. \nAs they tried to talk to the woman through the glass, the troopers claimed they saw Sykes walk out of the bedroom into a hallway, and the two officers then moved to another sliding glass door looking into the living room. \nThe troopers claimed \"the next time they saw Mr. Sykes, he was holding a long gun up to his shoulder\" as well as a revolver, which was pressed against the side of the long gun. \nThe man's wife, however, told investigators that Sykes had the gun pointed downward. \nThe two troopers drew their guns and began screaming \"State Police\" and \"drop the gun,\" according to the report. \nPolice said Sykes turned and pointed the long gun and revolver at one of the troopers, who fired at him four times. \nSykes went down and the troopers retreated off the deck, calling for backup, the report said. \nWhen the second trooper turned to check to see what Sykes was doing, police said, the man fired his shotgun through the glass door, grazing the trooper's elbow. \nSykes' wife tried unsuccessfully to call 911 and then called the couple's daughter, while Sykes himself separately called 911, telling the operator he had been shot by two \"prowlers\" and had returned fire, according to audio later obtained by NJ Advance Media. \nThe operator had Sykes' wife place the shotgun on the deck and told Sykes to walk out onto the front lawn. Other troopers who arrived to provide backup cuffed the elderly man, \"but un-cuffed him once EMS arrived and started treating his wounds.\" \nSykes was airlifted to Cooper University Hospital in Camden and is still recovering from his wounds. He was never charged over the incident, but the state investigation found the trooper was justified in shooting him. \n\"While there is a dispute about whether Mr. Sykes pointed the shotgun at the troopers before (one of them) fired, there is no dispute that Mr. Sykes was armed, did not comply with troopers' commands, and approached to within a few feet of the troopers with his shotgun and revolver,\" the report said. \nSkyes' attorney, Rich Kaser, said Friday he was not surprised by the ruling. Kaser recently filed a preliminary notice of intent to sue local, county and state officials over the incident. \nSpokesmen for the Attorney General's Office did not respond to an inquiry about whether the investigation would lead to any changes in how 911 calls are handled. \nS.P.
