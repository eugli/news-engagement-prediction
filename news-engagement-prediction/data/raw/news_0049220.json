The hypothetical orbit of Planet Nine is illustrated with the dotted line The researchers also analyzed the visible spectrum to determine their composition, including whether they have pure ice on the surface, highly processed carbon compounds, or even the possible presence of amorphous silicates as in the Trojan asteroids associated with Jupiter. This revealed that the values for 2004 VN112 and 2013 RF98 were similar to those seen in two other ENTOS: 2000 CR105 and 2012 VP113. All of these objects are a part of the group used to test the hypothesis of Planet Nine, and the researchers say they may have a common origin. Another, known as Sedna, was found to have very different values, and is thought to have originated from the inner part of the Oort cloud. WHAT IS PLANET 9? Astronomers believe that the orbits of a number of bodies in the distant reaches of the solar system have been disrupted by the pull of an as yet unidentified planet. First proposed by a group at CalTech in the US, this alien world was theorised to explain the distorted paths seen in distant icy bodies. In order to fit in with the data they have, this alien world - popularly called Planet Nine - would need to be roughly four time the size of Earth and ten times the mass. Researchers say a body of this size and mass would explain the clustered paths of a number of icy minor planets beyond Neptune. Its huge orbit would mean it takes between 10,000 and 20,000 years to make a single pass around the sun. The theoretical Planet Nine is based on the gravitational pull it exerts on these bodies, with astronomers confident it will be found in the coming years. Those hoping for theoretical Earth-sized planets proposed by astrologers or science fiction writers - which are 'hiding behind the sun' and linked with Doomsday scenarios - may have to keep searching. The find suggests the orbits of these two objects may have been altered by a larger object, possibly Planet Nine. The team performed thousands of numerical simulations to observe how their orbital poles would separate over time, revealing that a possible planet with a mass between 10 and 20 Earth masses orbiting the Sun at a distance of 300-600 AU could have caused the split around 5 and 10 million years ago. ‘The similar spectral gradients observed for the pair 2004 VN112-2013 RF98 suggests a common physical origin,’ says first author Julia de Leon. ‘We are proposing the possibility that they were previously a binary asteroid which became unbound during an encounter with a more massive object.’ Using the OSIRIS spectrograph on the Gran Telescopio CANARIAS (GTC), in the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory, the researcher measured the objects’ magnitudes (or, their brightness as seen from Earth) and recalculated the orbit of the 2013 RF98 Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:37:02.203+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
