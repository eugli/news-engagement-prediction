Key points: Up to $2,000 a year per child on offer Money to help cover childcare costs Demand for carers never greater, Foster Care Queensland says \nThe Government was also walking a fine line in the wake of the murder of Logan schoolgirl Tiahleigh Palmer, since her foster father Rick Thorburn was charged with her murder and her foster brother Trent Thorburn was charged with incest . \nIn response to Tiahleigh's murder, the State Government enacted the Family and Child Commission's recommendations to improve information sharing between government agencies when a child goes missing, and is setting up a register of home-based childcare services. \nToday, Minister for Child Safety Shannon Fentiman pledged $15 million over four years to help cover childcare and kindergarten costs for foster families in the hope of luring more carers into the system. \nFoster carers would be eligible to receive up to $2,000 per year for each child aged one to five. \nFoster Care Queensland executive director Bryan Smith welcomed the announcement, saying the incentives provided a sensible motivation. \n\"Most families have got to work. There is no choice in society today, we've got to make our dough,\" he said. \n\"We've got to be able to live, so families need to be able to work. \n\"Potential foster carers can now continue to do that, knowing that their gaps in child care are going to be paid.\" \nThere are currently about 5,000 foster carers in Queensland, but Mr Smith said the demand for more had never been greater. \n\"We continue to have children coming into care, we're no different to the rest of the western world,\" he said. \n\"If we could ... get up to say, 6,500 carers, we'd be doing very, very well.\" \nMs Fentiman said there was growing demand for children needing care. \n\"Dealing with domestic and family violence, drug and alcohol abuse means there are children out there at risk who have to come into out of home care,\" she said. \n\"We need to be doing everything we can to support our existing foster carers and of course do more to recruit more foster carers and that's what today's announcement is all about.\" \nThe out-of-pocket payments for carers will start from July 1.
