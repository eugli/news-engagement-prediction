Edelman caught the ball and then had it pop out of his hands after he landed on Alford’s leg, which led many to think that he failed to make the catch. Edelman was able to grab the ball before it hit the ground, however, and the Patriots continued on their way to the end zone. \nEdelman was asked after the game if it was his best catch. \n“I don’t know,” Edelman said. “It was only good if we won the game. Thankfully we did.” \nTom Brady was less equivocal in his postgame press conference when he called it one of the greatest catches of all time. Edelman chalked that up to his “bromance” with the quarterback, but plenty of other teammates were at a loss for the right words to describe the grab as well. That leaves little doubt about how big a place it will have in Patriots lore even if the bromantic flames should die out.
