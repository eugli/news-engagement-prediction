Turns out, that exploration is coming after all, in some potentially unexpected places? \n\"A lot of our upcoming movies will be as much up here as they are on Earth, starting with Thor: Ragnarok ,\" Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige told ComicBook.com during a visit to the set of the second Guardians of the Galaxy . \n\"There are three scenes on Earth in Thor: Ragnarok ,\" he continued. \"Everything else is Asgard, and worlds that certainly, in Thor lingo, are beyond the nine realms. There are planets that we spend a lot of time on in Thor: Ragnarok that certainly people would say, oh, that's sort of like the Guardians world; they're just other areas of the Marvel cosmic universe.\" \nBeyond the third Thor , audiences should perhaps look at 2018's Avengers: Infinity War — which brings Thanos into the spotlight as the villain of the piece — and 2019's Captain Marvel , centering around a character who gets her powers from an alien source, as other movies that could feature extra-terrestrial influence… although who's to say where the microverse of next year's Ant-Man and the Wasp could end up leading? \nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 will be released May 5.
