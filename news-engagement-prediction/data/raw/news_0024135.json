One of the investigators, Patrick Case, tweeted that so many people want to meet with him and fellow investigator Sue Herbert “that we may never finish,” and urged people to send “new comments confidentially” to their email address.\nBut the move has some parents and staff worried about just how private their complaints will be, as Case and Herbert have warned that written materials could be subject to access to information requests down the road.\nJason Koblovsky, a parent in Georgina, believes that because the potential emails could be made public, it will be a deterrent for many staff and parents to participate.\n“I am not sure why people’s email would be open to freedom of information requests,” he said. “It seems like they are trying to warn people off from responding. I think ensuring confidentiality is really important.”\n Education Minister Mitzie Hunter ordered the review of the embattled York board after concerns that incidents of racism and Islamophobia were being ignored, that a “culture of fear” is emerging among board staff, and amid controversies surrounding trustee travel and conduct. A report is expected in early April.\nTwo mothers affected by racism in York Region schools, Jacqui Testoni, left, and Charline Grant, wiping away tears, are shown during an emotional school board meeting in January. ( J.P. MOCZULSKI/ FOR THE TORONTO STAR ) In a letter sent to parents Wednesday and posted earlier on the board website, the investigators laid out the scope of the review which involves providing “observations and recommendations” related to transparency, trustee conduct, co-operation among trustees and staff, performance of staff and equity issues, among others.\nBut the note also suggests that “while our report to the minister will not use individual names and efforts will be made to remove identifying information, we nonetheless want to note that records, including submissions to this email address, could be subject to an access request under the freedom of information legislation, or subject to disclosure under other legislation.”\nIn an exchange between Case and Koblovsky, which Koblovsky shared with the Star, Case responds “there is only so much we can do in the allotted time.”\n“At present, we have about 50 respondents left to interview in 4-5 weeks,” he said. “At the close of that time, we must write the report — a good 2-3 week exercise.”\nHe says “written submissions are good,” and that it would be ideal to have them in by early March.\n“On the one hand, I thoroughly understand the validation experienced by being able to meet and speak with the reviewers,” he said. “On the other hand, the minister is serious about receiving our recommendations in a timely way.”\nPatrick Case is one of two troubleshooters appointed to investigate the York Region District School Board by the education minister. ( SUPPLIED PHOTO ) Case referred requests for comment to the ministry.\nMinistry of Education spokesperson Heather Irwin urged parents to contact Case or Herbert if they are concerned about confidentiality, and said that no identifying details — such as a name or address — would ever be released publicly, and that depending on what is disclosed, some of that information could also be removed before being publicly released.\nIrwin also said the ministry would not change the duo’s deadline to report, despite the demand.\n“We believe swift action is critical to restore public confidence in the York Region District School Board, and to ensure public confidence in the entire education system,” she said. “Due to the urgency of this situation, we are not considering an extension at this time.”\nBoth Case and Herbert can receive a maximum of $50,000 each for their work — $1,200 per day. That is in line with the pay given to Margaret Wilson, who was sent in to review and make recommendations on the Toronto District School Board when it suffered a string of controversies involving its director and contentious relations with trustees and senior staff.\nBut some York staff, who asked for confidentiality for fear of repercussions, say there are fears that emails could be tracked, or that their complaints could have repercussions in the long run.\n“I would prefer to meet in person, but because there is so much volume, we are hearing that might not be an option,” said one staffer, who would only talk on condition of anonymity.\n“Too many staff are scared to come forward over email, because of FOI (freedom of information) and the fear of long-term reprisals,” the staffer said.\nAnother staffer who was expecting to be called by the investigators, but hasn’t heard anything yet, said: “Given what has unravelled over the past year, I don’t know if two months is enough to uncover all the systemic issues that are plaguing the board.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T13:53:40.410+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
