Theo Walcott left red-faced as Arsenal fans slam club for 'disrespectful' gesture \nInstead, it was his fan-like celebrations and his presence on social media that put him in the heart of fans. \nBut this season is a different matter completely with Herrera establishing himself as a regular for the first team at the Red Devils. Herrera has proved vital in midfield (Picture: Getty) \nIt was September’s Manchester Derby defeat that convinced Mourinho that Herrera was the way forward when he injected energy, enthusiasm and vigour into the side’s play at half-time during the 2-1 defeat at Old Trafford. \nHerrera’s energy has provided the perfect platform for Paul Pogba to express himself in the team and, incredibly, the Spaniard’s now made more interceptions in the opponent’s half than any other player in the Premier League this season. Ander Herrera has made more interceptions (19) in the opponent’s half than any other player in the Premier League this season. #MUFC pic.twitter.com/w3fcaF8qDm ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T20:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:37:10.566+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
