speaking during Media Day at the Super Bowl.\nThe New England Patriots quarterback was speaking with the press ahead of his record-breaking seventh appearance in the Super Bowl when one reporter asked him to name his hero.\nBrady, 39, paused for a second and then answered: 'I think my dad is my hero, because he's someone I look up to every day.'\nHe then paused again and sat quietly in front of the room as his eyes began to tear up, looking as if he was going to break down at any second while thinking about Tom Brady Sr.\nThe visibly emotional football star managed to shut things down though by quickly repeating: 'My dad.'\nBrady then wiped away a tear from his eye and moved on to the next question.\nOpening up: Tom Brady was asked who his hero is while speaking with the press during Media Day at the Super Bowl in Houston on Monday (above)\nEmotional moment: The New England Patriots quarterback said it was his father, and then sat quietly in front of the room as his eyes began to fill up with tears\nWrapping it up: Brady, 39, then quickly shut down the waterworks and repeated his answer while wiping away a tear (above)\nBrady was far less emotional during the rest of the interview, especially when he was inevitably asked about his relationship with president Donald Trump.\nThe offensive great once again show off some impressive defense skills however as he went about shutting down that line of questions.\n'I’m not talking politics at all,' said Brady, who has known Trump for years and used to frequently golf with the billionaire businessman.\n'I just want to focus on the positive aspects of this game, my teammates and the reason why we are here.'\nBrady's tearful display of affection come less than a week after his father very publicly stated how little he cares for NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, the man behind the controversial Deflategate ruling which forced Brady to sit out the first four games of the season.\nWhen asked how he felt his son had been treated in the wake of the incident, which occurred during the 2014 AFC Championship Game, Brady Sr. told KRON4 that Goodell was a liar who had it out for his boy.\n'He went on a witch hunt and went in way over his head and had to lie his way out in numerous ways and the reality is that Tommy never got suspended for deflating footballs,' said Brady Sr.\n'He got suspended because the court said that he could, Roger Goodell could do anything he wanted to do to any player for any reason whatsoever. That’s what happened. The NFL admitted they had no evidence on him.'\nBest buds: 'My dad has been my best friend my entire life,' said Brady in an interview on Monday (above with his dad in 2006)\nFamily: Brady Sr. and his wife Galynn have three daughters in addition to their son: Julie (left with her brother), Maureen and Nancy (right with her brother)\nGrateful: ''I’ve been very, very fortunate,' said Brady when asked to speak about his family (above with his parents at the 2012 Super Bowl)\nBrady Sr. also spoke about how horrible the aftermath of the incident was for him as a father, regardless of his son's fame.\n'When it happens to your son, it’s a whole different context,' said Brady.\n'Or your daughter or any one of your kids and I think any parent kind of understands that. They’d rather take the slings and arrows in the heart than have their kids take it.'\nHe then added: 'For what the league did to him and what Roger Goodell constantly lied about is beyond reprehensible as far as I’m concerned.'\nJust two days prior, Goodell was forced to address the fact that he might be handing the Vince Lombardi trophy to Brady for the second time since he became head of the league.\nGoddell told Colin Cowherd in a radio interview on The Herd that it 'would be an honor' to pass over the prestigious hardware to Brady.\nHe also called Brady a 'surefire hall of famer,' and odd statement given that even those who do not already consider him to be the greatest of all time begrudgingly agree that a win on Sunday would cement the quarterback's status as the best to ever play the game.\nBrady Sr. had quite the retort for Goodell's statement in his interview, saying: 'It should be an honor because somebody that has Roger Goodell’s ethics doesn’t belong on any stage that Tom Brady is on.'\nSpeaking his mind: When asked about the possibility of Roger Goodell presenting his son with a Super Bowl Trophy, Tom Brady Sr. said: ''It should be an honor because somebody that has Roger Goodell’s ethics doesn’t belong on any stage that Tom Brady is on'\nPolitical queery: Brady was later asked about his relationship with President Donald Trump, but shut down that line of questions (Brady sitting ringside with Trump in Atlantic City at the Floyd Mayweather vs Arturo Gatti fight in 2005)\nReunited: Goddell said last week that it 'would be an honor' to hand the Super Bowl trophy to Brady (Goodell above in 2014 with Brady)\nOn Monday, Brady was asked about his father's comments in an interview with the Kirk & Callahan Show on WEEI radio.\n'I've banned my dad from talking,' said a clearly amused Brady.\n'He's no longer available to the media.'\nIn that interview Brady also discussed what it is that he admires so much about his father.\n'As any parent knows how much you love your kids. My dad has been my best friend my entire life,' said Brady.\n'He’s always been my No. 1 supporter. Hopefully he’s at the game cheering me on. He’s great man and I love him to death.\n'He’s taught me everything about life. Certainly about how to be a father because he’s been the best one a son could ever ask for.\n'I try to pass those things on to my kids because he was so supportive of not only me but my three sisters were all great athletes in their own right. My mom, they’re still married after close to 46 years.'\nHe then added: 'I’ve been very, very fortunate.'\nBrady Sr. and his wife Galynn have three daughters in addition to their son: Julie, Maureen and Nancy.\nThe three are all older than their brother and Julie is married to another Boston sports legend, former Red Sox star Kevin Youkilis.\nKids: Brady in a photo with his 9-year-old son Jack (right), a 7-year-old son Benjamin (left) and 4-year-old daughter Vivian (middle) taken last year\nWife: Brady married supermodel Gisele Bunchden back in 2009 after three years of dating\nImperial leader: Brady will be going to his seventh Super Bowl alongside his constant companion, Bill Bellichick (above in December)\nBrady now has his own family as she and supermodel wife Gisele Bundchen have a 7-year-old son Benjamin and 4-year-old daughter Vivian.\nThe quarterback also has a 9-year-old son Jack whose mother is Brady's ex, actress Bridget Moynahan.\nAnd it seems that Jack may be following in his dad's footsteps, with Brady speaking about how much his son knows about and loves the game in an interview last week.\n'My oldest son, he really knows the game. He had Devonta Freeman on his fantasy team, so he knows how good he is,' said Brady, referring to the Atlanta Falcons running back the Patriots will be desperately trying to stop on Sunday night.\nAnd his other two are not far behind.\n'Benny is getting there, and my daughter wants to go to the games. They’re such a main focus now. It’s been great to be able to share it with them,' said Brady.\nBling ring: With one more Super Bowl win Brady would break out of a tie with Joe Montana and likely cement his status as the greatest of all time (Brady above the Patriots event to receive their fourth Super Bowl rings in 2015)\nThe quarterback is now focused on trying to break the only football record he has yet to shatter on Sunday, with a win in Houston giving him a fifth Super Bowl ring - one more than legendary quarterback Joe Montana.\nHe will also be trying to break his tie with Montana when it comes to Super Bowl MVP trophies, as both men have three.\nBrady revealed on Monday that his wife had actually given him something for luck ahead of the game and spoke about nhis love for the Brazilian beauty.\n'I’ve been very blessed to find her. Wonderful woman, wonderful partner. She does everything,' said Brady.\n'She gave me this [necklace] for protection, and she’d be really happy that I’m wearing it because she doesn’t like anyone hitting me.\n'She always says, \"Throw the ball really fast, really fast.\" So that’s what I try to do.'\nThe New England Patriots will take on the Atlanta Falcons at NRG Stadium, Houston, Texas Sunday night, with kickoff scheduled for 6:30pm.", "external_links": ["http://itiswhatitis.weei.com/sports/newengland/football/patriots/2017/01/30/tom-brady-jr-tells-kirk-callahan-he-has-banned-tom-brady-sr-from-talking-to-media/", "http://kron4.com/2017/01/27/video-father-of-new-england-patriots-quarterback-tom-brady-rips-nfl-commissioner-roger-goodell-over-deflategate-investigation/", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-01-31T16:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T19:19:03.773+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
