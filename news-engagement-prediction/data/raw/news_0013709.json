Recent polls show Trump has the lowest approval rating of any new president in recent memory. Other recent polls show many Americans disagree with the tenets of his executive order on immigration , although one poll said 49 percent agreed , and 41 percent disagreed.\nTrump also hit back at news reports that indicated he might be delegating too much power to underlings. A recent New York Times report alleged Trump signed an executive order putting top adviser Stephen Bannon on the National Security Council without fully reading it and understanding what he was signing.\n\"I call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it.
