the former NBA star-turned-television analyst called the Cleveland superstar 'whiny'.\nJames, 32, was speaking to reporters in the locker-room after the Cavaliers 104-97 loss against the Dallas Mavericks on Monday night.\n'He's a hater... What makes what he says credible? Because he's on TV?' James told ESPN .\nDwyane Wade also came to the defense of his friend and former teammate, telling reporters the comments were along time coming for Barkley.\n'Thank God (James) finally said something. A lot of guys take shots at him... he just has kept his mouth closed... but it's about time he said something,' Wade told ESPN.\n'Sometimes when guys get a microphone in front of their face they just talk and talk ad talk and forget about their history. We all make that mistake, but especially that guy on TV. He acts like he just walked on water.\n'Humble yourself. LeBron is who he is. We all have flaws, but when your flaws are a little bit more then you should shut up.'\nThe comment came after Barkley bashed James on TNT's Inside The NBA last week, during a discussion about LeBron's recent complaints about his team needing improvements if it is to contend for another NBA title this season.\nScroll down for video\nLeBron James has blasted Charles Barkley after the former NBA star-turned-television star called the Cleveland superstar 'whiny'. James is pictured during Cleveland's loss to Dallas on Monday night\n'Inappropriate. Whiny. All of the above,' Barkley said, before going on to talk about some of the moves the Cavaliers have made in recent seasons since LeBron returned to the team.\n'The Cleveland Cavaliers, they have given him everything he wanted. They have the highest payroll in NBA history.\n'He wanted J.R. Smith last summer, they paid him. He wanted Iman Shumpert last summer. They brought in Kyle Korver.\n'He's the best player in the world. Does he want all of the good players? He don't want to compete?\n'He's is an amazing player... LeBron's a great player and a great guy... but it just pisses me off a guy that great don't want to compete.'\nBarkley bashed LeBron last week, after the Cavs star said his team needed to improve to compete for a championship. 'He's the best player in the world. Does he want all of the good players? He don't want to compete?' Barkley (pictured in 2015) said\n'He's a hater... What makes what he says credible? Because he's on TV?' James said about Barkley. LeBron is pictured during Monday's game against the Mavericks\nDwyane Wade (pictured with LeBron at the 2016 ESPYs) also attacked Barkley, saying: 'He acts like he just walked on water. Humble yourself. LeBron is who he is. We all have flaws, but when your flaws are a little bit more then you should shut up'\nThe comments seemingly stung James, as he could not resist going after Barkley on Monday night - despite initially only offering up the above Quote: .\nWhen a reporter asked James' Cleveland teammate, Tristan Thompson, about Barkley's remarks, LeBron interjected.\n'I'm not going to let him disrespect my legacy like that,' James told ESPN, before going on to list a number of the controversies that Barkley has been a part of during his career.\n'I'm not the one who threw somebody through a window. I never spit on a kid. I never had unpaid debt in Las Vegas.\nI never said, \"I'm not a role model.\" I never showed up to All-Star Weekend on Sunday because I was in Vegas all weekend partying.\n'All I've done for my entire career is represent the NBA the right way. Fourteen years, never got in trouble. Respected the game. Print that.'\nBarkley has been arrested a number of times, including - most famously - in 1997 and 2008.\nThe 1997 incident saw him charged with aggravated battery and resisting arrest without violence for throwing a man through a window at a bar. Speaking to the Sun-Sentinel at the time, Barkley - who was a member of the Houston Rockets - was unapologetic: 'What (police and witnesses) said happened, happened. The guy threw ice in my face, and I slammed his ass into the window. I'm not denying that. I defended myself. He got what he deserved.'\nJames then took it a step further, attacking Barkley's past. 'I'm not going to let him disrespect my legacy like that... I'm not the one who threw somebody through a window. I never spit on a kid. I never had unpaid debt in Las Vegas'\nIn 2008, Barkley was arrested for a DUI, which the 53-year-said he got after running through a stop sign because he was in a hurry to get oral sex from a woman in the car with him.\nIn 2008, Barkley was arrested for a DUI, which the 53-year-said he got after running through a stop sign because he was in a hurry to get oral sex from a woman in the car with him. This is his mugshot from the arrest\nA report from the officer who stopped the Hall of Famer read: 'He asked me to admit that she was \"hot\". He asked me, \"You want the truth?\" When I told him I did he said, 'I was gonna drive around the corner and get a b**w job.\n'He then explained that she had given him a \"b**w job\" one week earlier and said it was the best one he had ever had in his life.'\nJames' comment about gambling debts was in reference to Barkley being sued by the Wynn casino in 2008 after it alleged he owed $400,000.\nIn 2007, Barkley admitted he has lost more than $10million due to his gambling habit.\nHe also then took a shot at Barkley's friendship with Chicago Bulls legend, Michael Jordan. Barkley and other retired players from that era who are now in the media have often criticized LeBron and other current players for being too friendly with each other.\nBarkley (pictured in a mugshot in December 1991) was arrested in Milwaukee for punching a man in the face at a bar\nLeBron also accused Barkley of being hypocritical for criticizing today's players for being friends with each other. James pointed out Barkley's friendship with Michael Jordan (both pictured in the 1993 NBA Finals), saying: Barkley and Jordan were laughing and joking with each other during one of the games while somebody's shooting a free throw. In the Finals. But, oh, nobody were friends back then'\nJames, specifically, is close with Chicago's Dwyane Wade, New York's Carmelo Anthony, and Los Angeles' Chris Paul.\n'Go watch the '93 Finals when John Paxson hit the shot,' James said, referencing a shot made by the Bulls' guard that clinched an NBA Finals victory over Barkley's Phoenix Suns.\n'Barkley and Jordan were laughing and joking with each other during one of the games while somebody's shooting a free throw. In the Finals. But, oh, nobody were friends back then.'\nBarkley, 53, never won an NBA title during his illustrious career.\n'And if this makes him want to talk to me, the schedule's out there,' James continued.\n'He knows every road arena I'll be in. Don't just come up to me at All-Star and shake my hand and smile.\n'Screw Charles Barkley. I'm tired of biting my tongue, there's a new sheriff in town.'\nThe four-time NBA MVP also took a shot at New York Knicks president Phil Jackson - who LeBron clashed with earlier this year after the former coach called James' business partners a 'posse'.\n'Screw Charles Barkley. I'm tired of biting my tongue, there's a new sheriff in town,' LeBron (pictured before a game against the Brooklyn Nets on January 27) said\nLeBron also reignited is feud with New York Knicks president Phil Jackson (pictured), who angered James last year for referring to his business team - who are black - as a 'posse'\nRich Paul, Maverick Carter and Randy Mims are life-long friends of the Cleveland superstar, and have since forged successful business careers in their own right.\nPaul founded the prominent agency, Klutch Sports Group, Carter is the CEO of SpringHill Entertainment, and Mims was one of the founders of the LRMR Marketing.\nBut that didn't stop Jackson from making the disparaging remark about the group in an interview earlier this year.\n'You can't hold up the whole team because you and your mom and your posse want to spend an extra night in Cleveland,' he said, in reference to James and his associates.\nAt the time, James said he lost respect for Jackson after reading the remarks - which he said were racially-motivated.\n'I don’t believe that Phil Jackson would have used that term if he was doing business with someone else and working with another team or if he was working with anybody in sports that was owning a team that wasn’t African-American... but it just shows how far we have to go,' he said.\nIn Monday's comments, LeBron said of the former coach: 'I went to see Melo at the Garden two years ago when we were in New York, they played Portland. I went up to a suite at halftime, and Phil Jackson didn't say one word to me.\n'I'm here to win ballgames and take care of my teammates and take care of my, what's that word, oh, my \"posse\".'\nJames has become increasingly outspoken about issues as his career as gone on.\nThe superstar entered the political realm last year why writing piece endorsing Hillary Clinton, and then appearing with her at a rally in Ohio.\nHe also spoke out against gun violence and racial injustice - with his aforementioned friends, Paul, Wade, and Anthony - at the ESPYs last year.\nThen last week, when asked about how fan voting that determines which players are selected to the NBA All-Star teams, the 32-year-old rebuked Donald Trump.\n'There's always goofy votes,' James said. 'I mean, Donald Trump is our president.'\nTHE ROUND MOUND OF SCANDAL: CHARLES BARKLEY'S MOST CONTROVERSIAL MOMENTS When he spat on a young girl\nIn 1991, while playing for the Philadelphia 76ers, Barkley was being racially abused by a fan in New Jersey. Understandably incensed, the Sixers' star walked to the base-line and spat in the direction of the fan.\nHowever, his aim was off, and the spit hit an eight-year-old girl instead of the racist man. Barkley was suspended one-game and fined $10,000.\nHe went on to forge a friendship with the girl and her family, and has previously described the incident as his only regret.\nThe 'b**w job' arrest\nIn 2008, Barkley was arrested for a DUI, which the 53-year-said he got after running through a stop sign because he was in a hurry to get oral sex from a woman in the car with him.\nA report from the officer who stopped the Hall of Famer read: 'He asked me to admit that she was \"hot\". He asked me, \"You want the truth?\" When I told him I did he said, 'I was gonna drive around the corner and get a b**w job.\n'He then explained that she had given him a \"b**w job\" one week earlier and said it was the best one he had ever had in his life.'\nThe 'I Am Not a Role Model' campaign\nBarkley released a commercial Nike in 1993, for which he wrote the script.\n'I am not a role model,' he says at the start of the black and white commercial. 'I am not paid to be a role model... parents should be role models. Just because I dunk a basketball, doesn't mean I should raise your kids.'\nWhen he threw a man through a bar window\nBarkley was charged with aggravated battery and resisting arrest without violence for throwing a man through a window in Florida in 1997.\nSpeaking to the Sun-Sentinel at the time, Barkley - who was a member of the Houston Rockets - was unapologetic: 'What (police and witnesses) said happened, happened.\n'The guy threw ice in my face, and I slammed his ass into the window. I'm not denying that. I defended myself. He got what he deserved.'\nThe Milwaukee bar fight\nThe Philadelphia star was arrested in December 1991 after he alleged broke a man's nose at a bar in Milwaukee.\nA 22-year-old man claimed he heckled Barkley at a bar following a 76ers game that they lost to the Milwaukee Bucks, when the 'Round Mound of Rebound' casually walked over to him and punched him in the face.\nBarkley admitted to hitting the man, but claimed it was in self-defense.\nHe was charged with misdemeanor battery, but was acquitted in 1992\nThe Dream Team incident\nBasketball fans around the world love the Dream Team - the unfairly talented team of stars that dominated the 1992 Olympics.\nBarkley was a member of the team, and perhaps unsurprisingly, he couldn't escape controversy in Barcelona.\nDuring a game against Angola, which the USA won 116 - 48, Barkley elbowed a 175-pound opponent in the head.\nAsked afterwards if he had any regrets over the incident, Barkley said: 'I wish he was a little bigger... He might have had a spear, you don't know.'\nThe unpaid gambling debts suit\nBarkley was sued by the Wynn casino in 2008 after it alleged he owed $400,000.\nThe hotel claimed in extended four $100,000 markers to the basketball legend on October 18 and 19, however it said at the time they were not paid back.\nBarkley has not been shy of discussing his issues with gambling, and in 2007 he revealed he had lost more than $10million because of his habit.\nWhen he said LeBron James deserved to be punched in the groin\nBarkley made the controversial comment during the 2016 NBA Finals, after watching a play where James stepped over Golden State's Draymond Green - who was on the floor in front of him.\nGreen was suspended one-game for hitting James in the groin during the incident, which Barkley said was justified.\n'When a guy steps over you, you have a moral obligation to punch him in the balls,' he said. 'Because that’s really disrespectful... You’re supposed to pop him in his junk if he steps over you like that.'", "external_links": ["http://deadspin.com/5121873/charles-barkley-i-was-gonna-drive-around-the-corner-and-get-a-blow-job-", "https://lasvegassun.com/news/2008/may/15/wynn-sues-barkley-claims-400000-gambling-debts-unp/", "http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/18589897/lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers-throws-gauntlet-charles-barkley-hater", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-01-31T17:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T05:21:08.895+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
