Those sources and methods could include, for instance, the means that an agency uses to spy on a foreign government.\nEarlier Wednesday Trump assailed the intelligence community for the leaks that have become almost daily occurrences and stumbling blocks to the administration. “This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton’s losing campaign,” he tweeted. \nTrump wondered aloud if the FBI and NSA were the agencies responsible for “illegally” leaking intelligence to “failing” New York Times and Washington Post.\nHe concluded by deflecting from the recent resignation of Mike Flynn , saying, “The real scandal is that classified information is illegally given out by ‘intelligence’ like candy. Very un-American!”\nThe real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by \"intelligence\" like candy. Very un-American!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017 \n\nTrump has been fighting what many are characterizing as an uprising against his presidency from the U.S. intelligence community. Retired Army Lieutenant General Michael Flynn is being counted as the first casualty of the war as he resigned citing the broken trust incurred by a misleading statement he made to Vice President Mike Pence.\nWednesday evening the Senate Judiciary Committee demanded documents from the Department of Justice detailing the circumstances of Flynn’s resignation, and called for a briefing from the agency. Tuesday another leaked report claimed that Flynn wasn’t the only Trump campaign aide who had contact with Russian officials, but many others had multiple and constant contact before the election.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T11:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T06:29:48.357+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
