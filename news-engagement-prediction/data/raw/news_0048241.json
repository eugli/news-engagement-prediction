Vincent Janssen has scored only four goals - all of them penalties - for Spurs \nBut he told Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf : \"I have given myself at least a year to succeed and it's not over yet. \n\"I'm still young and, before I came here, I had played at the highest level only a year. I will fight with everything that is in me. Then we see. \n\"In training I feel I'm getting better, but match practice is the only thing I do not have at this time. I try to compensate by giving all in training. I do what I can.\" \nJanssen revealed he was asked about the idea of a move away from White Hart Lane in January, with reports in Turkey and the Netherlands that Galatasaray expressed an interest.
