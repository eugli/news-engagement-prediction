The multi-time Brazilian jiu-jitsu champion will face Katherine Roy at Legacy Fighting Alliance 6 on March 10 in San Antonio, the promotion announced Wednesday on Facebook. The main event of the card will pit Rivaldo Junior against Ray Rodriguez. Dern (2-0) won her first pro fights under the Legacy FC banner last year. Her victory over Montana Stewart with an Imanari choke (omoplata-choke combination) was a contender for Submission of the Year. Dern, 23, is one of the top prospects in MMA, male or female. The MMA Lab product is a two-time IBJJF world champion in gi and two-time champion in no gi as a black belt. Dern also owns an ADCC gold medal. Roy (1-0) won her pro MMA debut against May Ooi last July under the WSOF Global banner in the Philippines. The 31-year-old San Antonio native is a former Golden Gloves boxing champion. LFA 6 will be the sixth event since the Legacy-RFA merger last month. The co-main event will be the undefeated Eryk Anders against Larry Crowe. The card will take place at Cowboys Dancehall and air live on AXS TV.
