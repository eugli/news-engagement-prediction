As of Monday afternoon, the the driver of the crashed car had not been caught or identified. JOHN WEEKES/FAIRFAX NZ \nTire markes show where the group were doing burnouts. \nResidents said the incident was the latest in a series of events in Kowhai St, Vermont Grove and nearby areas. \nREAD MORE: \n\"They're going to kill someone one day,\" one local resident said. \"It's just totally ridiculous.\" JOHN WEEKES/FAIRFAX NZ \nAn incident in Kowhai St has sparked a police investigation and a resident says speeding drivers will kill someone unless action is taken. \nShe believed the same group linked to the crash were involved in violence, and said elderly people and children in the street were at risk from the neighbourhood bullies who repeatedly drove on the street like maniacs. \n\"We yell at them to slow down and they just yell abuse. Nobody will do anything about it because they're scared.\" \nShe said at least one stockcar involved in the Friday incident was stolen. \n\"The police have got to do something.\" \nA local man said the small antisocial group were the reason \"why at night we park our cars up on the grass verge\". \nHe said \"all the neighbours pitched in to help\" the man who's fence was wrecked. \nAnother local, also unwilling to be named because she feared repercussions, said the mayhem went on for some time on Friday. \n\"I was putting my daughter to sleep when they went past...It sounded like the wheels locked up. Then I heard a big crash sound. Then all you heard was the wheels stuck, trying to get unstuck.\" \nThis went on \"a good five minutes,\" she said. \n\"When they took off, they took off in a hurry.\" \nSeveral police attended from Wainuiomata and Lower Hutt. \n\"It was reported that the driver of the stockcar was wearing a full helmet but shortly after crashed into a fence,\" a police spokeswoman said. \n\"Police are aware of the area, and are undertaking investigations into the cause of the crash last Friday,' she added. \nThere were no reports of any injuries resulting from the crash. ï»¿ - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T14:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T10:04:48.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
