But last month, he went into exile , 22 years after taking power in a coup. His democratically elected successor has since accused Mr. Jammeh of plundering the treasury and fleeing with millions of dollars. Photo Yahya Jammeh first took power in Gambia in a coup in 1994. He is now in exile in Equatorial Guinea. Credit Thierry Gouegnon/Reuters A lesser-known source of income for Mr. Jammeh, though, had been a head-spinning scheme.

A review found that many of those who enrolled didn’t settle in Hong Kong. Instead, they used their Hong Kong passports for easier travel to other countries (but probably not to Gambia).
