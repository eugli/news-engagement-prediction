The boy's cause of death: Homicide.\n\"Try to imagine a 9-year-old that obviously has some developmental problems and is not a normal height for a 9-year-old. Nevertheless, this child is so severely malnourished that the closest thing I can think of are the pictures from World War II concentration camps liberation.\n\"The bodies which were stacked like wood, that were literally skin and bones. This child looked like that,\" Kohr said.\nFour people have been charged in connection with the boy's death. None are the boy's biological relatives but two of them, Hubert and Robin Kraemer of Vigo County, had been his legal guardians since just after his birth.\nOn Thursday, Hubert Kraemer and Robin Kramer were seen outside an Indiana court along with Chad Kraemer and Sarah Travioli, who also face charges related to Cameron's death.\nOfficials arrested Chad Kraemer, 33, Hubert Kraemer, 56, Robin Kraemer, 53, and Travioli, 30, for neglect resulting in death after paramedics were called to a Vigo County home Tuesday morning.\n\"Literally skin on a skeleton,\" Vigo County Sheriff Greg Ewing told InsideEdition.com. \"Worst thing I've seen in my 26 years... I have a 9 year old.
