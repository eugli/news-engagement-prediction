Khadra was returning from a trip to renew his visas in Jordan. \nThe Office of Refugee Resettlement confirmed to Khadra's attorneys that he's being held in Chicago, according to Anisa Thobhani, one of his lawyers. Government agencies have not given his lawyers a reason why Khadra was detained. \n\"We don't know the details of what happened or why he got held up,\" Thobhani said. \"He's a minor. He's alone. He doesn't know where he is. He doesn't even know if the family is trying to get a hold of him or not.\" \nKhadra lives in Katy, Texas, with his older brother, who has a green card. His parents are in Jordan. Khadra has a visitor's visa, his attorneys said. \nAttorneys haven't been able to talk with Khadra in the days since he was taken into custody. It will take at least another three to five days before the shelter processes their paperwork and allows them to communicate. \nThe attorneys said they believe the situation is connected to Trump's executive order, which suspended the U.S. refugee program and froze immigration for seven majority-Muslim countries. Jordan was not included in the order. \nMuslims from any country appear to face more scrutiny in U.S. customs now, said immigration attorney Ali Zakaria, one of the boy's lawyers. \n\"My experience talking to the client (the brother), my observations at the airport as a volunteer and my discussions with other attorneys around the country leaves me to believe that Customs and Border Protection at the airport is pulling all Muslim travelers, even those not from the seven listed countries, for secondary inspection and questioning them and reviewing their documents for three to nine hours,\" he said. \nKhadra's brother could not immediately be reached. \nZakaria said officials have to separate minors from the general population, but he doesn't know why Khadra was taken to Chicago. \nHis firm is first trying to reunite Khadra with his brother. Then they will take a deeper look at what happened, he said. \nTwitter @ElyssaCherney", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:11:19.311+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
