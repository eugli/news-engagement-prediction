But there's always room for one more leak, right? The newly leaked image that you can examine below presents the LG G6 in three color variants: mystic white, astro black, and ice platinum. We kind of knew that these three G6 color versions existed (see here , here , and here ), but it's certainly nice to be able to glance upon an image that shows them all in one place. Posted on Twitter by Evan Blass (@evleaks), the new image can be seen as a re-confirmation (albeit an unofficial one) of the fact that the G6 is very different from its predecessor, the LG G5. Among other novelties, the new LG flagship phone offers a large 5.7-inch FullVision display with rounded corners, a water-resistant metal body, and a dual rear camera that doesn't protrude. Also of note is that this is not a modular device. While we're waiting for LG to finally reveal all that there is to know about the G6 (including carrier and pricing details), you may want to check out our G6 rumor review .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T07:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T03:23:01.849+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
