The Dubai Police have confiscated counterfeit construction goods worth Dh 400,000 after raiding a warehouse in Nad Al Hamar. The seized products include tons of building materials being passed off as from famous international brands. Colonel Salah Bu Osiabah, Director of the Anti-Economic Crimes Management, said his department received tip-off about an Asian who stored and sold large quantities of fake construction materials. After getting permission from the public prosecutor, the undercover police swooped down on the warehouse and seized a variety of tools and materials. On being interrogated, the accused confessed having imported the fake products from an Asian country in separate consignments. The samples of seized goods have been sent to the General Department of Criminal Evidence to ensure that they are counterfeits and to compare them with the original brands and tags. The accused has been referred to the Dubai Public Prosecution. Bu Osiabah pointed out that the sale of counterfeit products causes losses of several millions worth of losses. He added that owners of many international brands have lauded the efforts of Dubai Police for cracking down on the trade, which has led to the reduction of such crimes and fewer complaints. He called on the people to immediately report if they find counterfeit goods or have information about them, while underlining that the police teams are carrying out inspections in various places and shops suspected of having fake materials. amira@khaleejtimes.com ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:35:33.263+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
