We Talked to the Man Trying to Find Him. \nDan Taberski made Missing Richard Simmons , the first great podcast of 2017. Most Popular By Dave Holmes Feb 23, 2017 In February 2014, the loudest man on Earth went silent. Richard Simmons, the face, voice, and very tiny shorts behind a multi-billion dollar exercise cult of personality, just…stopped. No more talk show appearances, no more classes at his workout studio Slimmons, no more contact with close friends or employees. Nothing. He went from everywhere to nowhere, with no explanation. The story drives this year's first must-listen podcast. In his limited-run series Missing Richard Simmons , filmmaker Dan Taberski ( The Daily Show , Andrew W.K.'s Destroy Build Destroy ) explores the Simmons story, sorts through the theories, and tries—if not to drag him back to public life—to at least make sure he's OK. Episode Two just dropped this week, and I am already furious I have to wait a week for the next one. (Episodes are available one week early with a premium subscription to Stitcher.) Taberski has planned for six episodes, with the possibility for more installments, should more information come to light. Here's hoping. Related Story The 25 Essential Podcasts of 2016 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below I caught up with Taberski to talk about Simmons' cultural significance, our theories about what's happened to him, and our shared experience as objects of his mild, almost charming sexual harassment. ESQ: Do you think Richard Simmons is listening? Dan Taberski: It's so hard to tell. I have no way of knowing. I will say this, without giving away what we do in later episodes: I go to great lengths to make sure that he has every possible opportunity to hear this podcast. But I don't know. I hope he is. Part of me thinks it would be hard to resist, just putting myself in his position, but then part of me thinks he's resisted so much for three years in terms of being out there in the public that I wouldn't be surprised if he resists this as well—at least for now. Most Popular My assumption is that he must be aware on some level. He strikes me as the kind of person who has a Google alert set for himself. [ Laughs ] There have been times where I've talked to certain sources that I know are in contact with him, like they're on his payroll, and they will say comments that make me think, \"Maybe he's not listening.\" Like, that he will hear that somebody wrote an article as opposed to reading the article or, you know, he'll hear that somebody said things instead of hearing it himself first-hand. So it is possible that he may have even shut all that down. What he's done is so severe that I wouldn't be surprised if he went all the way. Like with the Internet—just literally unplugging his house. Getty Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Do you have any theories about what has happened to him? What was your working theory when you started the show? My working theory when I started the show was sort of what I was hearing, and what I was getting from the conversations I was having with people who took his class. Basically I started with the people who took his class—the people from Slimmons. And I know that sounds like it's just the random people in your Zumba class, but it's not like that at all. These are people who have known him for 10, 20, 30 years—they were his friends. They were close. So I started with them. And there were a couple things going on with his health: He had knee surgery at one point, and then he had to get another knee done, and so that was a working theory, that that was what precipitated it. His dog died in the beginning of 2014. Actually, the last email I got from him was about his dog. And there's a whole story that goes with that dog. [ Ed. Note: that dog story is in Episode Two, released this week. ] So there were little things that sort of pointed to maybe it was just a really tough year for him, and he just decided to step away and catch his breath, and that just turned into this. But it gets deeper—it gets much deeper. And things that I don't really want to talk about, just because I want to make the storytelling interesting, but there's a lot more going on. And then I have my theories, sort of longer-term, about why I think he would stop doing this. On one hand, there's cutting off all friends and family and closing Slimmons; on the other hand, he was an advocate for fighting obesity for 40 years. Like, this was his mission. And why would you have to stop that if you were going to retire? Why not still keep a tiny little foot in that world? So there are larger theories that we explore. Getty Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Sure. I wonder, with him, whether there is such a thing as doing anything halfway. I feel like if he would open the door a tiny bit, he would not be able to help himself from throwing it all the way open. He can't really be small. Yeah, he is an incredibly stubborn person. In the best and worst ways I think. And that's how he becomes successful. That's how you have, you know, a 72-club franchise by the time you are 35. But yeah, it's also how he lost—we discuss that in later episodes, where we go back into his history—his weight loss was all or nothing. You know, he preaches sensible weight loss now, but he lost his weight, you know, he lost something like 150 pounds in two months or something like that. I don't have the numbers. And so in terms of it being all or nothing, he certainly has a history of that. Most Popular In Episode One, you talk about your first class at Slimmons, and the way that you described it, I thought \"I might have been at that same class,\" but then I thought, \"No, he's kind of just that racist and crazy all the time.\" [ Laughs ] Totally. He's got an Archie Bunker streak to him, but in a really funny way. And you kind of forgive him for it, but there were many times in that class where everyone's just kind of looking at each other thinking, \"If this were any place else, you could not get away with that.\" No, of course not. And I was stunned that nobody had their iPhone camera going and selling the tape to TMZ. But I think there's just an unspoken code once you walk in those doors: What happens there stays there. Yeah, I mean, first of all, as you know, there's no phones. You cannot bring your phone in. But then again, I mean, what are they going to do? Frisk you? So yeah, I'm surprised as well. And it's just hard to bring across just how insane he was in that class. In a great way. But like, this is a man who has cut loose. This is his space, he created it, he's had it for 40 years, and he's going to do what he wants. And he does it. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Yeah, and he's going to make you take your shirt off, and he's going to pretend to foam at the mouth, like a rabid dog. And he may dry-hump you a little. Totally. He will for sure dry-hump you a little. In that class, in that moment afterwards where you wait 45 minutes to take a picture, he'll pull some people out of line and talk to them very closely for a moment. He pulled my boyfriend out of the line and he said, \"You have a wall around your heart.\" And Ben was like, \"Huh. OK. I'm sorry.\" And he said, \"No, that's good. Keep that wall.\" [ Laughs ] That's weird. That is weird advice. That is not good clinical advice. But getting back, in that class I took, he talked about his dalmatian and how what he wanted more than anything in the world was just for him to live one more year. And you could tell that the dog was getting old; those of us who go nuts about our dogs, we understand. That might set a very sensitive emotional person over the edge. So if there's an injury, and then that kind of emotional wound, I would imagine that weight gain plays into his disappearance somehow. Because that's kind of the only thing that Richard Simmons can't do: appear in public severely overweight. That is certainly one theory, but the other half of that is that there are lots of things that Richard Simmons couldn't do: He couldn't cut himself off from people, he couldn't not help that one more person, he couldn't stop teaching class. And he did. He stopped doing all the things that were Richard Simmons. He stopped doing all those things. So, for me, there are no rules anymore in terms of what Richard can and can't do, because he's taken those rules away for himself it seems. So I don't know. I will say, I'm not super sold on that one. People bring it up, and I think about it and for some reason—that's a hard habit to break, the 40 years of exercise.

And I've met that dog, and that dog died when she was 17. She was 17, that was an old fucking dog. Beautiful, but old. Like the crypt keeper-old. And he loved that dog. And that's one of eight, at least, that he had. So, you know… Getty Was it the last of the eight? Last of the pack. Oh, wow. Yeah, so it's not just like your dog died, it's like a lifetime of dogs—and watching. If you're a sensitive person, you really feel things when they happen, and to watch your dogs die one by one and then the last one goes at 17 when you're already feeling fragile, sensitive, and you're sort of entering a certain phase of your life. That's a big freaking deal. I assume you read the story in the Daily News a few years ago from someone who claimed to be in his inner circle about how his housekeepers are sort of keeping him hostage? Yeah, we actually talk to the guy who wrote that. So without giving too much away, do you put any stock in that theory? I don't put stock in the craziest version of that theory, no. But just because that story sounds crazy, it doesn't mean the person telling it is completely not believable, and I don't think that that story is necessarily coming from a malicious place. We do end up talking to that person, and it's an incredible story and it is just sort of the tip of the iceberg in terms of describing a complicated man. So no, I don't believe it. That's my first answer. My second is, \"But…\" Ok, that is a tantalizing answer. So, you and I are both gay men of a certain age… How old are you? 45. Oh, ok. We are of a certain age. And we grew up with Richard Simmons who—while he's never been out—has always been a visible and fairly obviously gay person, which is a significant thing. Without ever really making a stand one way or the other, he was an exuberant man who was on our TV every day for a long time, which is not a small thing. He has importance in that way, would you agree? Yeah. I don't discuss his sexuality in the podcast, but, that being said, he is an original. And making your own rules like that puts you in gay icon status regardless of whether or not you're gay. And he made up his own rules. He's culturally queer, whether he was ever actually… Totally, yes. Absolutely. Sure. And he would, I'm sure, own that and love it. Getty You mention in Episode One that you and your husband became friendly with him. How does that happen? How does a relationship with Richard Simmons develop? Richard Simmons is not a celebrity like George Clooney is a celebrity. He was the most successful celebrity on the planet. I believe it. You could go and take a class with the person and start a conversation with the person. A big part of where this podcast goes is getting people to really, truly understand how many people he had intense, emotional, personal years-long relationships with that he met on the street, he met in the class, his assistants—just anybody. Speaking of not having a wall around your heart: He built intense personal relationships with thousands—tens of thousands of people I'd say—over those 40 years. And so, having some sort of relationship with Richard Simmons is not hard at all. You just go to his class, and you really get a sense of him and he focuses on you, and he will remember you after that first day. And so it just happened slowly. We would talk longer after class, and then we would start emailing, and maybe a phone call once in a while, and then I went to behind the scenes of him recording one of his videos, which was incredible. And then I went over to his house for lunch and then I went over for dinner and then he came to our [house]… you know, it just sort of evolved. Like him slowly letting me in—and vice-versa. Related Stories Simmons: 'No One Should Be Worried About Me' And then it just stopped? We were negotiating—the details of the story are boring. It's basically, we were negotiating a deal to do a documentary and then basically he put it on hold, saying he wasn't quite ready. And then, like, two months later he disappeared. Is there a message you want to get through to Richard if he's listening or reading? You'd think I'd have a good answer to that. I guess the message is: I don't want to drag him back. I want him to live the kind of life that he wants. But I also want to be able to show him even a modicum of the empathy that he showed the world for the past 40 years. I just want him to accept some empathy. That's my goal with this. And I want to understand. In the grand scheme of things my request is not much, I just want to talk to him. That's it. I just want to talk to him and understand and let him know that he's loved, because I just have a sinking feeling that he doesn't believe it. Which is so crazy for somebody who's built a life around telling people to love themselves. You just wonder—you just wonder.
