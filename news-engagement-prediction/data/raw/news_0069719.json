As long as there are elements of corruption, there will be a probe, said MACC deputy chief commissioner (operations) Datuk Azam Baki. He said religion was not a tool that could be used or abused for personal gain. \"No agencies will be left out of our scrutiny and we will go after anyone who commits a wrongdoing. If they think we will not take action against them, then they better watch out,\" he said in a statement Tuesday. Azam said more officials from religious bodies were being monitored for alleged corruption and that he did not rule out making more arrests soon. He said that religious officials should set a good example for others to emulate. \"But the opposite is happening. Position and power should never be abused. We view this seriously as they are entrusted with responsibilities by the society,\" he said, adding that they should carry out their tasks with integrity and honesty. Azam said the arrest of religious officials in Johor was not the first by the MACC and would not be the last. On Monday, the MACC detained four officials from the Johor Islamic Religious Department and a district Islamic Studies Office for alleged graft and abuse of power.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:14:47.629+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
