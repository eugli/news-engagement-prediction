Other rallies held in Raleigh this year have been critical of Trump. \nSaturday's protesters also plan to push for the repeal of House Bill 2, which limits LGBT rights and which bathrooms transgender people can use. Other topics will include opposition to gerrymandering in redistricting and to the repeal of former President Barack Obama's health care overhaul. \nThe march begins near Raleigh's Memorial Auditorium and ends near the old Capitol Building. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T19:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T14:32:42.818+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
