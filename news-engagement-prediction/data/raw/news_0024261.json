Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nMPs tonight voted for Article 50 by a landslide - despite Theresa May blocking every amendment to her so-called 'Brexit Bill'. \nBritain is closer to the EU's door after 494 backed giving the Prime Minister permission to begin Britain's two-year exit. Some 122 voted against. \nTheresa May survived a Tory rebellion threat and crushed all 16 amendments that were formally added to the Bill . \nThat added to the fury of Labour MPs who complained the Bill was being rushed through without enough scrutiny. \nDid my MP vote to trigger Brexit? Search by name or constituency after final Article 50 Bill debate \nSo inevitably Jeremy Corbyn faced a repeat of last week's rebellion in which 47 MPs including 17 frontbenchers tried to block Brexit. \nThis time Shadow Business Secretary Clive Lewis joined them - becoming the fourth Shadow Cabinet minister to quit and rebel against his leader. \nSo did shadow business minister Chi Onwurah, leaving Labour whips with 11 frontbenchers - and three whips! - who rebelled. It's not yet been decided if they'll be sacked. \nBelow are all the Labour MPs who voted against triggering Article 50 in the final vote tonight. \nJust one Tory MP, Ken Clarke, rebelled to vote against the Bill. All 52 Labour MPs who rebelled in the final vote \n* = 5 MPs who did vote against the Bill the first time, but have now after the Bill was not amended. \n** = frontbencher or whip \n*** = was a frontbencher, has already quit \nHeidi Alexander (Lewisham East) \nRushanara Ali (Bethnal Green and Bow) \nMr Graham Allen (Nottingham North) \nDr Rosena Allin-Khan (Tooting)**", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T03:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:03:38.177+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
