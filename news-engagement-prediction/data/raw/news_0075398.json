But there is no such thing as a global anthem, a global currency or a global flag. This is the United States of America that I’m representing. I’m not representing the globe, I’m representing your country.” \n“There’s one allegiance that unites us all, and that is to America. America, it’s the allegiance to America. No matter our background or income, or geography, we’re all citizens of this blessed land. And no matter our color or the blood — the color of the blood we bleed, it’s the same red blood of great, great patriots. Remember, great patriots, we all salute with pride, the same American flag, and we all are equal — totally equal in the eyes of almighty God, we’re equal,” Trump said Friday.

He told us humility is a virtue. False humility is an affront to the sense,” Clarke said.
