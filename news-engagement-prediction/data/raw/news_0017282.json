Real estate agents like Trisha Sears are talking up the value of $350,000 condos that are now largely bought by locals instead of the out-of-towners who used to pay $1 million. In place of celebrity sightings , presidential visits and an ambition to be the next Vail, Colo., there is talk about a family-friendly vibe and the absence of crowds. Mostly there is a sense of comfort that whatever the resort ends up being, its destiny belongs to people who live and ski here instead of some faceless banks. “It gives a sense of stability, not just to the resort but to the community,” said Ken Roberts, chairman of the Idaho Tax Commission and a farmer whose family has been in Donnelly for more than a century. “You now have owners who have a vested interest in seeing it being successful.” And there are worse things than living next to a newly built resort where the lift lines range from small to nonexistent. On a recent morning between runs, Steve Bussolini, 67, a retired college administrator who lives in nearby McCall, joked that the parking lot is so empty that he never has to walk more than 25 steps before putting his skis on.

But then he found a path through the trees and discovered lots of fresh powder. “It makes for better skiing,” he said. Mr. Boespflug and his investors started building the resort in 2002. Real estate was booming, so they financed the construction with hundreds of millions of dollars in home and condo sales, and by 2004 the ski lifts were up and running. The local community, hit hard by job losses in the logging industry, hailed skiing and recreation as a way to revive the economy of rural Valley County, about 90 miles north of Boise. Nearby Cascade had just been slammed by the closing of a Boise Cascade sawmill that had been the area’s biggest employer. The hope for new jobs was why Brad Backus, a Tamarack ski guide who also served as Donnelly’s mayor, gave the town a new motto — “Crossroads to Recreation” — that is etched onto the granite sign announcing your arrival. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story That vision seemed in doubt in the winter of 2008, when Mr. Backus started hearing rumors that the resort, like the economy, was having financial troubles. He figured business would slow down and, at worst, someone would step in to buy the resort. But a few weeks later, the resort abruptly closed. The next day, when Mr. Backus and his wife went to collect their skis from an office, they had to shovel a path through the empty parking lot on what should have been an epic powder day. “It was eerie,” he said. Mr. Backus spent the next few years trying to sustain his family while keeping the town solvent with a flurry of federal grant writing. At one point he had to take a leave to work a construction job in Seattle. In the meantime, the resort missed a season and Mr. Boespflug missed a court date . He hasn’t been seen in town since.

When Louise Francesconi bought her home at Tamarack in 2009, just as things were getting rough, she was looking for a good deal on a ski home near relatives. Instead she got a full-time job. Ms. Francesconi, a longtime military contracting executive, became president of the homeowners’ association in 2016 and spent the last year negotiating to have a group of homeowners buy the resort’s assets — land and buildings, mostly — from creditors. So, technically speaking, does this mean she went to buy a house and ended up with the resort? “It sounds complicated, but it’s accurate,” she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T12:17:30.447+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
