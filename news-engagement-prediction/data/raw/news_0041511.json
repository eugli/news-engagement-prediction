These days, that's a conservative position.\" \n\"I care about the environment and living also,\" countered Maher. \nThe conversation quickly led to comparisons of liberals vs. conservatives, famous faces of the Democratic party and Trump himself. \nYiannopoulos praised Maher for being \"the only good one\" of liberals, saying he thinks \"your side has gone insane\" and the Democrats have become \"the side of Lena Dunham.\" \n\"The more America sees of Lena Dunham, the fewer votes the party is ever going to get,\" he said, before Maher asked him not to pick on \"fellow HBO stars.\" The Breitbart editor also took cracks at Amy Schumer and Sarah Silverman. \"I like to think of myself as a virtuous troll,\" he explained. \nWhen asked by Maher about his motives for harassing Ghostbusters star Leslie Jones on Twitter (which caused Yiannopoulos to be banned from the social media platform ), he replied, \"I read a bad review of the movie, am I not entitled to do that?\" \n\"I simply don’t accept that the star of a Hollywood blockbuster is sitting in a Hollywood mansion crying over mean words on the internet. Get over it,\" he added. \"She’s been deployed by the studio because the movie is sinking. Mean words on the internet don’t hurt anyone. What actually hurts people is murder, violence, not mean words.\" \nMaher interjected, \"Which some people say you’ve incited,\" to which Yiannopoulos brushed off, \"Well, they’re idiots.\" \nMaher, emphasizing that since Yiannopoulos is a supporter of free speech, ended their chat by telling the Breitbart editor that it was time to \"jump off the Trump train.\" \n\"Oh come on, he's fabulous,\" Yiannopoulos replied. \nOther guests for the night included Leah Remini, former Rep. Jack Kingston, Malcolm Nance and former Nightly Show host Larry Wilmore. Earlier in the week, news of Yiannopoulos' booking on the show prompted plenty of backlash, with Scahill, co-founder of The Intercept , canceling his appearance on the Feb. 17 episode. \n\"There is no value in 'debating' him,\" Scahill, who has appeared as a panelist on multiple occasions, explained in a statement posted to Twitter. \"Appearing on Real Time will provide Yiannopoulos with a large, important platform to openly advocate his racist, anti-immigrant campaign. It will be exploited by Yiannopoulos in an attempt to legitimize his hateful agenda.\" \nYiannopoulos sent a message to Scahill for refusing to appear on the show: \"If you don’t show up to debate, you lose.\" \nMaher, who previously lobbied to have Yiannopoulos on his show, responded to Scahill's cancelation with the following statement: \"Liberals will continue to lose elections as long as they follow the example of people like Mr. Scahill whose views veer into fantasy and away from bedrock liberal principles like equality of women, respect for minorities, separation of religion and state and free speech.\" \nHe added, \"If Mr. Yiannopoulos is indeed the monster Scahill claims – and he might be – nothing could serve the liberal cause better than having him exposed on Friday night.\" \nThe conservative provocateur, who recently signed a book deal with Simon & Schuster, has been on a college speaking tour, which has been met with protests and occasional violence at multiple university campuses. On Feb. 1, Yiannopoulos' scheduled talk at UC Berkeley was canceled out of safety precaution after protestors started a bonfire and threw smoke bombs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T06:26:56.280+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
