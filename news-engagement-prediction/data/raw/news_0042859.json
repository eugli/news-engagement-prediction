(Photo: Kim Klement, USA TODAY Sports) \nReturning Starters/Contributors: Isaiah Wynn (Sr.), Lamont Gaillard (Jr.), and Dyshon Sims (Sr.) \nNotes: Georgia loses Greg Pyke , Tyler Catalina and Brandon Kublanow from the 2016 season and that leaves three holes to fill. Right tackle, left tackle, and center. Gaillard is the favorite to step in at center although Sims has worked there quite a bit since last season’s bye week before the Florida game. Sims will also battle at left and right guard while Wynn gets looks at left guard and left tackle. All three improved as the year progressed in 2016 and will be light years ahead of others in regards to their knowledge and practice of the scheme. \nContenders: Pat Allen (Soph.), Kendall Baker (Jr.), Chris Barnes (RFr), Michael Barnett (Soph.), Aulden Bynum (Sr.), Ben Cleveland (RFr.), Sage Hardin (Soph.), D'Marcus Hayes (Jr.), Solomon Kindley (RFr.), and Sam Madden (Soph.) \nNotes: This will be a big spring for each of these contenders and for difference reasons. It’s probably now or never for guys like Allen, Hardin and Madden. If they don’t make a move in their third year in the program, there’s a good chance those players from the 2016 and 2017 classes will leap over them. For guys like Bynum and Baker, time is running out in general. \nThen you have Hayes, who’ll be given every opportunity to win a job at tackle. At 6-foot-6 the raw ability is there. Early word is that he must get in shape in order to win a job. Barnett has been working on the offensive line for just four months now, so he might need some time. Not a member?

Sims was the sixth man a year ago and could be again this year. But having worked at all five spots on the offensive line, he could exit spring as the favorite for a number of positions. What happens with Wynn, however, is a big part of that. If he stays at left guard, that puts Sims in a situation where he’ll have to play on the right side. If Wynn ends up at left tackle, Sims is likely the left guard. \nKeep an eye on Cleveland at both guard spots and right tackle. He got quite a bit of work there. As stated earlier, Hayes will have his shot at tackle as will Kindley at guard, who challenged for time on the right side a year ago. Another guy who did that was Allen, who could also play either guard spot or right tackle. Barnett is a bit of an unknown. He has all the raw tools and then some but after moving over from the defensive line will he be ready in time to make a move this spring? \nPost-spring projection: It’s hard to imagine the UGA coaching staff not wanting to get a good long look at Hayes at G-Day. Coming out of spring, expect him to be the starter at one of the tackle positions. For now we’ll say left tackle. Wynn is the projection at left guard and Gaillard at center. The UGA staff seems to be high on Kindley, so he’s the projection at right guard but it’s a lot less clear at right tackle. Bynum, Baker, Cleveland, and Sims will all have an opportunity there. At the end of the day, however, Sims experience could pay huge dividends here. He came in at right tackle against Ole Miss when Pyke and Wynn went down, so we’ll project him as the right tackle coming out of spring. Another guy to watch is Barnett at either tackle spot. \nNo matter what happens, there’s a group of talented freshmen arriving in June that will shake things up. Netori Johnson can contend at either guard spot and he’ll be almost 20 years old when he arrives in Athens. Andrew Thomas and Isaiah Wilson are also candidates to play right away. \n(What's next for the Bulldogs?
