Yemen is currently embroiled in a civil war with civilians in danger. But unlike some other cases, Judge Birotte’s ruling seemed to apply throughout the country, not just to Los Angeles International Airport. And while other orders had blocked the deportation of travelers, Judge Birotte explicitly wrote that the government could not detain them or block their entry into the country. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The ruling could affect hundreds of people who are in their home countries or stuck in airports in other countries, hoping that they would somehow be permitted to travel to the United States. “Even after previous rulings, people have continued to have their visas and green cards canceled or coerced into signing them away,” said Ahilan Arulanantham , the deputy legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California. “This should end that.” While the A.C.L.U. has filed several complaints against the executive order, they are not involved in this case.

We very rarely get such uniform and swift action by the judicial branch for anything.” In the days since the executive order was issued, border officials and airline employees throughout the world have stopped people from the affected countries — Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — from boarding planes headed for the United States. The Yemeni plaintiffs also said in court filings that American officials had confiscated their passports, repeating similar complaints from other travelers in the last several days. Mr. Arulanantham said that while he believed the previous court orders had implied that United States officials should not prevent valid visa holders from getting on planes, Judge Birotte’s order should force the government to stop that practice. But even after a New York judge ruled that people with valid visas should not be sent back to their home countries, there were reports that it was continuing to happen. In many cases, travelers reported being held for 24 hours or more, far longer than a typical inspection to enter the country. It remains unclear how the Trump administration will respond to the numerous judicial orders issued in the last several days.
