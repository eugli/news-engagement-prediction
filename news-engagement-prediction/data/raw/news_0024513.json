It does not include children transferred to UK where they have close family here.\n'We will announce in due course the basis on which further children will be transferred from Europe to the UK under Section 67 of the Immigration Act to the specified number.'\nCalls for Britain to take in unaccompanied children were spearheaded by Lord Dubs, pictured, whose amendment to the Immigration Act requires the Government to 'make arrangements to relocate to the UK and support a specified number of unaccompanied refugee children from other countries in Europe'\nThe Home Office minister went on: 'As required by the legislation, we have consulted with local authorities on their capacity to care for and support unaccompanied asylum-seeking children before arriving at this number.\n'Local authorities told us they have capacity for around 400 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children until the end of this financial year.\n'We estimate that at least 50 of the family reunion cases transferred from France as part of the Calais clearance will require a local authority placement in cases where the family reunion does not work out.\n'We are grateful for the way in which local authorities have stepped up to provide places for those arriving and we will continue to work closely to address capacity needs.'\nHe added that the Government will continue to meet its obligations under the Dublin Regulation, and accept responsibility for processing asylum claims where the UK is determined to be the responsible member state.\nLiberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said the announcement was a 'betrayal of these vulnerable children and a betrayal of British values'\nThe Government has not specified a date for when the Dubs scheme will end but it is expected that the remaining children will be resettled this year.\nLiberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said the announcement was a 'betrayal of these vulnerable children and a betrayal of British values'.\nHe added: 'Last May, MPs from all parties condemned the Government's inaction on child refugees in Europe, and voted overwhelmingly to offer help to the thousands of unaccompanied kids who were stranded without their families, backed by huge public support.\n'Instead, the Government has done the bare minimum, helping only a tiny number of youngsters and appearing to end the programme while thousands still suffer.'\nA Downing Street spokesman said: 'We are working with councils, but we have to recognise that lots of these children who are transferred under this scheme have very pressing and difficult needs and there is a limit to the capacity for local authorities to provide that level of care.'\nThe spokesman said the Government was 'continuing work to resettle vulnerable children' under various mechanisms and it was possible that further young people could come to the UK under the Dubs arrangements in future.\n'There was no figure in the Dubs amendment,' he added. 'We were very clear we would make provision where we were able to. That is what we have done and what we continue to do.'", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T19:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:25:26.989+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
