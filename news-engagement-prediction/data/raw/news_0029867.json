Photo: Kevin Winter/Getty Images After years of Tidal having exclusive access to his music, Prince’s biggest hits are now available on the streaming service of your choice. The move comes, as rumored , in tandem with the Grammys’ tribute to the late artist during the Sunday night ceremony. Purple Rain , 1999 , Sign O’ the Times , Controversy , Parade , Dirty Mind , and various hits collections are among the Purple One’s works that have made their way to services including Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora, Amazon Prime, and iHeartRadio. Not all of Prince’s music has made the jump to wider availability, though. Some later works, like The Black Album , The Gold Experience, and Chaos and Disorder , are bound by different contracts and so are not available to stream. Still, some pretty darn decent scores.
