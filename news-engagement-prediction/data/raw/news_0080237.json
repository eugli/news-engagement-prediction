Addressing the students during the march Yechury sit out at ABVP and said \"Our nationalism is 'We are Indian' not 'who is a Hindu'? By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: February 28, 2017 6:52 PM Asserting that the party will be raising the issue in the Parliament, Yechury claimed that this is a collective fight to defend constitutional rights. (PTI) \nAs the students of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and Delhi University (DU) hold protest march against Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) in the North Campus area of DU, CPI(M) leaders like Sitaram Yechury and D Raja also joined the march against the RSS-backed group. Addressing the students during the march Yechury sit out at ABVP and said “Our nationalism is ‘We are Indian’ not ‘who is a Hindu’? Further slamming ABVP, the CPI(M) General Secretary stated that the safron group cannot win with their intellectual skills and hence trying to replace it with violence. Further asserting that the party will be raising the issue in the Parliament, Yechury claimed that this is a collective fight to defend constitutional rights. \nEarlier in the day, Yechury targetted Union Minister Kiren Rijiju over his reported ‘Leftists celebrate when jawans die’ remark and stated that the RSS men celebrated when Mahatma Gandhi was killed. Over a post in Twitter, he mentioned, “Who celebrated after Gandhi was killed! ‘RSS men expressed joy and distributed sweets after Gandhiji’s death’ Patel to Golwalkar, 11-09-1948 (sic).” \nWatch: \nRijiju reportedly hit out at the Left parties over Delhi University student Gurmehar Kaur’s claims that she received rape threats following her social media campaign against the RSS-affiliated ABVP. He reportedly said that creating controversy over the student is not right and it is about Leftists who allegedly celebrate when country’s jawans (soldiers) die. \nAs heated controversy continues following Kargil Martyr’s daughter Gurkeerat Kaur’s social media campaign against the ABVP, after violence in the Ramjas College, the RSS backed group has today claimed that the violence among the students was intrigued by left wing parties. Further claiming that the speech of JNU student Umar Khalid was actively opposed by the DU students, the ABVP members stated that they won’t tolerate anti-national slogans in their campus and will protest and fight against it. Addressing the media, Ankit Sangwan, an ABVP member alleged the Left of vandalism and spreading anti-national propaganda at the Delhi University campus. \n(With inputs from agencies)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T01:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T16:00:46.448+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
