These represented 102 individual offences carried out over three years. \nA police summary stated that Hohaia's job as administrator included paying the kura's bills by direct debit, cheque, Bizlink credit card or booking it on a business account. \nIn the cheque butts she wrote legitimate business transactions to deceive the kura, but made the cheques out to herself or to cash. \nOn some cheques she added false details, including wages and holiday pay, to make them appear legitimate. \nDuring the three years she bought personal items including a chest freezer, juicer, two Samsung Galaxy tablets, clothing, household items, Christmas decorations and gifts, confectionary, fishing equipment, fireworks and grocery-type items. \nEventually some anomalies were noticed in the accounts and the offending was revealed. \nHohaia's lawyer, Rajan Rai, said his client had told him: \"The temptation got the better of me. I have been poor for a long time. I wish I had never done it, I wish it had never happened.\" \nShe had attended a hui with the school whanau and written a letter to the judge expressing her remorse. \nRai said his client did not have the income to repay the money, but offered to pay reparation at $20 a week, which over ten years would be a small dent in what had been stolen. \nHe asked the judge to take into account Hohaia's remorse and the effect imprisonment would have on her two children and urged her to impose a sentence of home detention. \nHowever, Judge Harrison said home detention was not sufficient to hold Hohaia accountable for the theft and the deprivation she had caused the children at the kura. \nNeither was she able to order any meaningful reparation to be paid. \n\"I've read a lot about your lies and deception and how you duped a lot of people.\" \nThose people included the school principal, who was the co-signatory for the school's chequebook and had trusted Hohaia implicitly and not questioned the cheques she was asked to sign. \n\"I've read the victim impact reports,\" said the judge. \"The school van can't be used because the repairs can't be paid for. The van isn't around to take children to and from school, you are putting a financial burden on the parents of the children. \n\"The school playground had to be pulled down some years ago and the school was supposed to have been saving to replace it, but there is no money available because of your theft.\" \nHohaia's remorse was due to the predicament she found herself in, Harrison said. \n\"You told the probation officer 'everything was left to me, everything got out of control, I was left to do it.' In my view you considered it was somebody else's responsibility to tell you to stop. You knew it was wrong and you kept doing it, year after year.\" \nAlthough her lawyer had said imprisonment would have a considerable impact on her children, the children's father has indicated he would care for them, she said. \n\"Your children had the benefit of your dishonesty, new clothes, food, tablets and a TV, Christmas decorations and gifts. You didn't think of the consequences to these children of being found out while the children [at the kura] were deprived of the support for their education.\" \nAfter the sentencing, the kura kaupapa's Board of Trusteeswas disappointed to have been left out of pocket because Hohaia did not have to repay the money, spokesperson Maata Wharehoka said, which was nearly half the school's operating budget each year. \n\"We feel that justice has not been served. It means the kura will have to go looking for money for the playground and the van.\" \nShe said Hohaia had been meticulous with her offending, making it difficult to detect. As well, she was a member of the wider family of the kura, and was trusted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T11:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T06:25:05.661+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
