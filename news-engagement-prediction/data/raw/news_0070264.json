By Jenna Amatulli \nNeed an excuse to move to Sweden? Here’s a saucy one. \nA councillor for the town of Övertorneå wants Swedes in his town to take a one-hour paid break from work to go home and have sex, according to Swedish paper, The Local. \n“There are studies that show sex is healthy,” said Per-Erik Muskos, the 42-year-old city councillor of Övertorneå, to the AFP news agency. \nMuskos says the proposal is “aimed at improving people’s relationships” and that the “ municipality is suffering from reduced population and the deficit of births .” “This means that childbirth should be encouraged,” he wrote in the motion. “When sex is also an excellent form of exercise with documented positive effects on well-being, the municipality should kill two birds with one stone and encourage employees to use their fitness hour to go home and have sex with their partner.” Employees in Sweden already get a fitness hour to exercise mid-work day, so Muskos is simply suggesting that companies advocate their people to use that hour for, uh, sex. AleksandarNakic via Getty Images Muskos told The Local that he didn’t see a reason for the motion to not pass, because there’s “no way to verify that employees do not use their hour for other purposes than spending time with their partners or spouses.” \n“You can’t guarantee that a worker doesn’t go out for a walk instead,” Muskos said, then suggesting employers trust their employees. \nAlso important: Muskos wants both single people and those in relationships to have the right to use the fitness hour this way. \nPer-Erik Muskos, you are a revolutionary. Who’s up for packing up and heading to Övertorneå?
