Leicester made history two years in a row, one year because they did the most beautiful thing in the Premier League and in football history.

We need to adapt to it.\" \nMourinho can stand in solidarity with Ranieri as he himself was sacked by Chelsea just seven months after leading the club to the title in 2015. \nHe explained: \"When I was sacked as a champion I thought it was a giant negative thing, now I realise it was peanuts compared what happened to Claudio. My Instagram was a little homage, my shirt is another one. I don’t think he needs more homages because no one can delete what he did.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T21:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T17:16:04.158+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
