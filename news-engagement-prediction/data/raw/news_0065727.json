He ended up at Marseille instead, even though he made no secret of his desire to come back to Manchester. Article continues below \n“I have nothing to hide,” Evra told beIN Sports after confirming he tried to re-sign for the Red Devils. “Jose Mourinho was okay to that but somebody was a little bit unsure about my return at home. \n“So after I know Manchester was closed, I opened up every other door and there were a lot of clubs [interested]. But when Marseille came [in], I chose Marseille straight away.” Article continues below \nBut despite being denied a fairytale return, Evra will always cherish his memories as a Manchester United player. Evra: Liverpool was like no other fixture \nAnd there was one fixture he relished playing in more than any other. \nAsked if matches against Liverpool were ‘just three points’ like every other game, Evra laughed and then said: “No! It’s something special. \n“I hate to play against Liverpool, it’s a bad feeling. When you lose at Anfield, I promise you the rest of the week is going to be bad.” Evra: What Fergie would do if we lost to Liverpool \nEvra then went on to reveal how Sir Alex Ferguson would react if United ever lost to their fierce domestic rivals. \n“Ferguson, if you lose against Liverpool, you don’t see him for one week,” Evra added. “For one week he won’t even shake your hand, so deeply hurt he [would] be.” Video: Evra on Liverpool and Fergie \nThis is well worth a watch... \nThis is part of what made Fergie, Fergie. He was a ferocious competition who absolutely hated losing. Evra will always have huge respect for Ferguson \nBut despite Ferguson’s foul moods after losing to Liverpool, Evra holds no grudges against his former boss. In fact, his admiration for the legendary Scot could hardly be higher. \nAfter leaving United for Juventus in the summer of 2014, the left-back reserved special praise for the man he still refers to as ‘the boss’. \n“An immense thank you to Sir Alex Ferguson for making it all possible,” he was quoted as saying by the Daily Mail , “for giving me the privilege to be a captain, to be inspired by the legend of Manchester United and to understand that nobody is bigger than the club.” \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
