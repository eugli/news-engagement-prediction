Pictured: A Libyan fighter waves a flag after IS were defeated in Sirte Transparency International, which campaigns against corruption in governments, outlines a number of recurring themes used by IS to recruit people in its research.\nIn social media posts, it highlights systematic corruption - including nepotism and bribery - while presenting itself as a provider of security, justice and welfare.\nIt also plugs into a sense of discrimination felt by Sunni groups, and suggests the West and its allies are complicit in the corruption.\nWhat's more, corruption has physically weakened some forces - like the Iraqi army, which did not have enough soldiers to combat IS when it first attacked Mosul because thousands of people were being paid, but not actually working.\nMs Dixon warns this means that without addressing the problem at the highest level IS will not be defeated.\nIn particular, Ms Dixon - who co-authored the report - said \"what we shouldn't be doing is putting western taxpayers' money into helping create exploitative, predatory state forces\".\n\"This is not just about closing off the corrupt channels that enable the day-to-day operations of groups like IS, but rethinking relationships with the Mubaraks [in Egypt], Gaddafis [in Libya] and Malakis [in Iraq] of the future,\" said Ms Dixon.\n\"Corruption is a real security threat, more than just a means for elites to line their pockets. In the end corrupt governments by fuelling public anger and undermining institutions, are the architects of their own security crises.\"", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9780/production/_94748783_8c304381-a593-4c46-8c43-77fa5a4d16c7.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4960/production/_94748781_fac9744b-cada-4f99-acd3-41630cf8c734.jpg", "http://www.transparency.org.uk/"], "published": "2017-02-21T05:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T10:09:40.788+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
