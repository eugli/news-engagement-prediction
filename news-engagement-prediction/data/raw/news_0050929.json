The country once had a heroin epidemic that affected around one per cent of its entire population.

In 2012, it had just 16 drug-related deaths in a country of 10.5 million.\n\"Legalizing drugs even across our country would take it out of the dealers' hands and lets give it to the doctors and put it in health perspective where we know people would then be able to have safe access to predictable medication as an alternative to illicit street drugs,\" Twan said.\n\"The research is out and there's a lot of things that we could be doing to prevent these deaths.
