perhaps the most eccentric rock star of the 80s, which is saying a lot. Prince hit it big with enormous albums like \"1999\" and \"Purple Rain.\" Following his success in the 80s, Prince briefly changed his name to that weird symbol thing and continued to release albums, some of which were popular, some not so much. Today, Prince continues to be enormously successful thanks to his past songs and present live shows. He's also still just as eccentric. On January 7th, Billy Joel set out to perform 21 concerts in 2014 alone. To say he's been a prolific performer in recent years, wouldn't do him justice. David Bowie blew everyone out of the water with his song and video for \"The Stars (Are Out Tonight)\" form his latest album The Next day in 2013. 2013 also saw the successful tour of \"David Bowie is\" a dynamic retrospective art exhibit that toured from Europe to North America. Portrait of musician Elton John, 1970. (Photo by Jack Robinson/Hulton Archive/Getty Images) There's no stopping Elton John, really. Besides touring and performing non-stop (most recently at Bonnaroo), Elton John also started the Elton John Aids Foundation and has a residency in Las Vegas called, \"The Million Dollar Piano.\" UNSPECIFIED - CIRCA 1970: Photo of ABBA Photo by Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images Beloved Swedish-pop group ABBA released a photobook in September 2014 titled, \"ABBA: 600 Rare, Classic, and Unseen Photos Telling the Complete Story.\" The book serves as a first complete and authorized visual history of ABBA. UNSPECIFIED - CIRCA 1970: Photo of Bruce Springsteen (Photo by Larry Hulst/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images) Bruce Springsteen received the prestigious Kennedy Center Honours in 2009. He also released his 8th studio album in January 2014, titled \"High Hopes.\" In the last several years he's been actively touring--currently in South Africa before moving on to Australia and the United States.

(Photo by Joel Ryan/Invision/AP) It's 2014 and Led Zeppelin is still on The BillBoards' Top Selling Albums list, with their self-titled, remastered album. Although Led Zeppelin's performances have died down, John Paul Jones, Jimmy Page, and Robert Plant received the prestigious Kennedy Center Honors award in 2012--given to those who have shaped American culture. Kiss and Def Leppard have joined musical-forces for a U.S Tour this Summer. In April 2014, Kiss was featured on the cover of the Rolling Stone magazine--a first time in over 40 years! Diamond Dave became an 80s rock heartthrob as the lead singer in Van Halen. He left in 1985, unimpressed with the synth-pop direction the band was moving toward. In the decade to follow, Roth had a briefly successful solo career and did some acting in various projects. Roth has since been in and out of Van Halen numerous times. Today, he's once again the band's lead singer, and they last released an album called \"A Different Kind of Truth\" in 2012. Sammy Hagar became an 80s rock icon when he took over as lead singer in Van Halen for David Lee Roth in 1985. Hagar’s Van Halen run was actually the band’s most commercially successful, but he was fired in 1996 after beefing with Eddie Van Halen. Since then, Hagar has continued to perform as a solo artist and as the singer of Chickenfoot, as well as becoming filthy rich independently through opening restaurants and by selling his multi-million dollar Cabo Wabo tequila company. In the 80s, Ozzy found his fame as a metal solo artist with huge songs like \"Crazy Train\" and \"Bark at the Moon.\" Although he has continued making music up until the present both on his own and with the reunited Black Sabbath, Ozzy became even more famous as the bumbling but loveable dad in the early 2000s MTV reality series \"The Osbournes.\" He reunited with Black Sabbath last year to record the aptly titled \"13\" and next month will release \"Memoirs of a Madman,\" a CD and DVD celebrating his solo career. Ozzy Osbourne dominated our TV screens at home with his family's reality-tv show \"The Osbournes\", but now that that's out of his system, Black Sabbath have had a prolific two years of touring. They are about to embark on the second leg of their European tour. When it comes to '80s female rockers, Annie Lennox was one of the coolest. Her music with David Stewart in the Eurythmics fused rock, pop and new wave, and was pretty darn big in that decade. Following the 80s, Lennox pursued a hugely successful solo career throughout the 90s and 2000s. She got the Eurhythmics back together for a stint from 1999-2005, and a brief performance earlier this year. She has a new solo album called \"Nostalgia\" coming out in late October. Jon Bon Jovi is best known as the frontman and namesake for giant 80s band Bon Jovi. They were a enormously popular with songs like \"Livin' On A Prayer\" and \"Wanted Dead or Alive\" and continue to be a huge touring act to this day. In the decades following the 80s, Jon Bon expanded his resume by getting into acting as well, with roles on shows like \"Sex and the City\" and \"Ally McBeal.\" Though the Jersey band has gained considerable musical credibility over the years, female fans still love him just like they did in the 80s. Richie Sambora became famous as Jon Bon Jovi's right hand man and lead guitarist and co-writer in Bon Jovi in the 80s. Since their rise to fame in that decade, Bon Jovi has remained a touring juggernaut. In the decades that followed however, Sambora had a few rehab stints for substance abuse and was arrested for a DUI in 2008. Last year, Sambora was kicked out of Bon Jovi for personal reasons and is not touring with them. But there have been rumours he will return to the band next year for a new album. After a brief reunion in 2005 for a performance at Live 8, Pink Floyd made it clear that the band will not be reuniting. Since then, bandmates Syd Barrett and Richard Wright have passed on. Roger Waters however continues to tour and perform. Besides making an appearance at Milan Fashion Week, the band is still touring full-force, with an upcoming appearance in Kitchener, ON on July 13th. Slash became an 80s rock legend as the lead guitarist in Guns 'N Roses. After quitting the band in the mid-90s after frustration with Axl Rose and the band’s inactivity, Slash went on to play in a few other bands, most famously Velvet Revolver with Scott Weiland and his old GNR band mates. In recent years, Slash has written a popular autobiography, licensed his likeness to the video game \"Rock Band 3,\" written an \"Angry Birds\" theme song and is has a new solo album due out this fall. Axl Rose and his former pals from Guns ‘N Roses managed to release one of the 80s best albums and arguably the greatest debut of all time with \"Appetite For Destruction.\" In the 80s, GNR were huge, but not your typical corny hair metal act. In fact, they basically killed that whole genre (just ignore Axl's hairspray 'do in the \"Welcome to the Jungle\" video). Sadly, Rose's ego was too big for the band and every other member ended up getting fired or quitting in the mid-90s. Rose kept the band name alive, but took almost 15 years to put out a new album that ended up being the crappy \"Chinese Democracy.\" He still tours as GNR today with a band of hired, er, guns.

(Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) Stevie Nicks is prepping for a tour with Fleetwood Mac and is also in midst of finishing her new solo album, \"24 Karat Gold: Songs From the Vault.\" Marie Fredrikkson and her popular 80s Swedish pop rock band Roxette found a lot of success in the second half of the 80s with their first two albums. Following that decade, Roxette continued as an internationally successful band into the early 90s. In the years to follow, Fredrikkson released solo material, defeated brain cancer in the early 2000s and kept making music as one half of Roxette. Despite falling out of mainstream popularity many years ago, Roxette is still a band today with Fredriksson at the helm. Alice Cooper is currently completing a mini-solo tour prior to joining Motley Crue in Grand Rapids, MI for the \"All Bad Things Must Come To An End\" tour. Sounds epic. One of the 80s biggest bad boy rock stars was Motley Crue drummer Tommy Lee. In the 80s, Lee and his band of notorious glam rockers partied their brains out while touring the world, but their popularity was squashed in the 90s. Although Motley Crue toured and released music on and off until finally deciding to retire this year, Lee has gone on to make a much-viewed sex tape with ex-wife Pamela Anderson, starred on reality shows like \"Tommy Lee Goes To College\" and \"Rock Star Supernova\" and has recently tried to get into acting with appearances on \"Californication.\" Vince Neil became an 80s rock icon thanks to his time in Motley Crue, cranking out notorious glam rock albums like \"Girls, Girls, Girls\" and \"Dr. Feelgood.\" Neil left Motley Crue after their success in the 80s to take up race car driving and a mildly successful solo project. He got back with the band in the late 90s and has stayed with them until their final shows this fall. Apart from music, Neil has opened tattoo shops, restaurants, vineyards and, of course, strip clubs. Joan Jett found her biggest success as a rocker in the '80s in her post-Runaways days. Jett and her band The Blackhearts had some mega hits in the early 80s like \"I Love Rock and Roll,\" \"Bad Reputation\" and \"Crimson and Clover.\" Jett continues to be a rock icon and still releases music and performs with the Blackhearts. She has also dabbled in acting in television and on Broadway in the 90s and 2000s. Most recently, Jett sang \"Smells LIke Teen Spirit\" with Nirvana for their Rock Hall induction. Joe Elliott is the longest serving member of British 80s hair metal icons Def Leppard. Although his band has been deemed cheesy in the decades following the 80’s, Elliott and his band mates were responsible for two of the biggest albums of that era in \"Pyromania\" and the enormous \"Hysteria.\" Although not popular in the mainstream following the 80s, Joe Elliott still performs to big crowds with Def Leppard today on frequent summer tours, and the band has sold over 100 million albums worldwide. Turns out everyone loves cheese. Sebastian Bach, the pride of Peterborough, Ontario and one-time lead singer of late 80’s cornball metal group Skid Row, ended up getting kicked out of the band in 1996 over a disagreement with the other members about whether or not they should open up for KISS. Since his firing in the 90s, Bach has since gone on to star in various Broadway plays like Jekyll & Hyde and Rocky Horror Picture Show, as well as playing in various other bands that included a super group with Ted Nugent and Jason Bonham. Bach also released a solo album this past spring featuring Duff McKagen that didn't exactly make a splash. It sold 4,000 copies in its first week of release. Steve Perry became an '80s rock icon as both a solo artist and the lead singer of Journey during their most popular \"Don't Stop Believing\" and \"Any Way You Want It\" period. After a hip injury and a disagreement with his bandmates, Perry quit the music business in the mid-90s. Perry was never seen onstage again until this past May when, for the first time in 19 years, he performed onstage singing a few Journey songs with indie rockers the Eels at shows in Minnesota and LA. Many fans are still aching for an original Journey reunion. Journey has joined musical powers with Steve Miller Band for a grand global tour. Both bands are set to perform at the Ottawa Bluestfest on July 4th. The Akron, Ohio-born singer attended Kent State where she formed a band with Devo's Mark Mothersbraugh, was a rock critic for the NME and work for Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood's \"SEX\" shop all before joining The Pretenders in the late-70s. They became one of the '80s most important rock bands, though Hynde was often the only original member, and continued to release music to lesser success throughout the 90s and 2000s. Hynde actually released her first solo album, \"Stockholm,\" just this past summer. Twisted Sister frontman Dee Snider was one of the most recognizable faces of 80's hair metal and wrote one of the decade's most iconic rock songs, \"We're Not Gonna Take It.\" Since the band's diminished popularity following the 80's, Snider has been a busy man. He has hosted a morning radio show in Hartford, voiced commercials and video game characters and even a \"Spongebob\" character, worked for VH1 as a host and narrator for specials and even starred in a very short-lived reality show with his family called \"Growing Up Twisted.\" Snider even starred in the musical \"Rock of Ages.\" Twisted Sister also got back together in the 2000s and performs as a nostalgia act from time to time. Pat Benatar was one of the biggest female rockers of the 80s. Not only did she have a couple platinum albums and big tunes like \"Hit Me With Your Best Shot\" and \"Love Is A Battlefield,\" she was also the first ever female performer on MTV. Benatar went on to release a few albums in the 90s and one in the early 2000s. Benatar still tours regularly, most recently as Cher's current opening act, and she's also been rumoured to have a new album in the works. Eddie Money was an 80s rock star best remembered for his catchy tune \"Take Me Home Tonight.\" Since the 80s, Money still tours with other rock stars and bands from the 80s, playing casino-type gigs, and even tried his hand at acting with appearances on shows like \"The King of Queens.\" He released albums up until 2007 and continues to perform occasional concerts. He also starred in a GEICO add in 2012 in which he sang \"Two Tickets to Paradise.\" Bret Michaels, the lead singer of Poison, was one of the biggest faces of hair metal in the 80s. Poison had a couple big songs in that era like \"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\" and was a touring force for a little while. Although they're still a touring nostalgia act today with other 80s bands like Def Leppard, Michaels has made more of a name for himself as a reality TV star. He has searched for love on VH1’s \"Rock of Love\" and even shown some business savvy winning a season of \"Celebrity Apprentice.\" Description Linda Ronstadt performing at a WPLR Show in New Haven, Connecticut in the New Haven Veterans Memorial Coliseum | Source http:// ... On April 10th, Linda Ronstadt was introduced into the 2014 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Ronstadt also released a 'musical memoir' called \"Simple Dreams\" in September 2013, that chronicles the musician's journey and inspirations behind some of her most beloved songs. In 2013 the Texan blues-rockers released \"Live At Montreux 2013\" on DVD, Blu-ray, and digital formats (how about that for keeping up with the times?). The band is also currently on tour in Europe and United States. In Spring 2014, AC/DC announced that rhythm guitarist Malcolm Young will not be recording or going on tour with the band due to a sever illness. However, AC/DC continues to write and play music and has said that they are 'very like' to tour before the end of this year. There's no stopping Sir Tom Jones: in 2012 Jones released yet another album, titled \"Spirit In The Room\". Jones is still a prolific performer, currently touring in Europe, and has been honoured with a Lifetime Achievement Award to recognize his half-century in the music business.

If you're feeling a little nostalgic - and up to the challenge - you can pick up Simon's recently released guitar songbook and try to recreate some of Simon's most coveted songs. Barbara Streisand continues to grace the big screen with comedic and charming flare, most recently she starred with funny-man Seth Rogen in \"The Guilt Trip.\" She's also continuing to perform and has made a special musical appearance in 2013 on the popular TV show \"Glee\". The Canadian-rock group continues to perform, the 2014 line-up consists of Derek Sharp, Jim Kale, Will Evankovich, Garry Peterson, and Leonard Shaw. On June 19th, Loverboy announced their first all-original album in seven years, \"Unfinished Business.\" Joni Mitchell Celebrates her 70th Birthday at No Vacancy, Los Angeles Simon LeBon has been the lead singer for pop-rockers Duran Duran for 34 years. The band found their biggest success with albums like \"Rio\" and \"Notorious\" in the 80s, fuelled in large part by their MTV videos, and they also had a brief 90s comeback. While the original members have been in and out of the band over the years, LeBon has remained on lead vocals. Duran Duran, who still occasionally tour arenas, are working on a new album produced by Mark Ronson and longtime collaborator Nile Rodgers. Siouxsie Sioux was frontwoman of cult rockers Siouxsie and the Banshees. Thoug beginning in the late 70s, Siouxsie and her band released the bulk of their music in the 80s before finally calling it quits in the mid-90s. Siouxsie continued to work on her side project Creatures, as well as a variety of solo material with other notable artists, and one solo album in 2007. After a five-year hiatus from music in the late 2000s, Siouxsie returned to performing last year. Stephen Pearcy was the lead singer for LA hair metal rockers Ratt during their brief rise to fame in the 80s. They had a platinum record in \"Out of the Cellar,\" but their fame diminished with each subsequent record. Pearcy left the band in the early 90s, and went on to form a number of other non-successful groups, as well as a solo career and an attempt at acting. He has reunited with RATT time and time again only to quit, with the most recent occurrence happening this very year.

In 2013, Gaynor released a book called \"We Will Survive\" that feature forty true stories of inspiration and survival. Oh Dolly. Besides continuing to perform, Dolly Parton has opened several dinner and family attractions, such as \"Dolly Parton's Dixie Stampede,\" \"Dollywood,\" \"Dolly Parton's Imagination Library\", \"DollyWood's Splash Country,\" and \"Pirates Voyage.\" Devo has always been an eclectic bunch: in 2012 they released a single called, \"Don't Roof Rack Me, Bro (Seamus Unleashed)\", that was dedicated to Presidential candidate Mitt Romney's former dog Seamus. Unfortunately, two of the band members - Alan Myers (in 2013) and Bob Casale (in 2014) - have since passed.  シェア", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T16:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T11:53:17.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
