It also did not carry the force of law even before that decision. \nIn a joint letter from the U.S. departments of Justice and Education, Republican administration officials said the Obama administration guidance “has given rise to significant litigation regarding school restrooms and locker rooms.” \nThe letter says the departments plan to “further and more completely consider the legal issues involved.” \nThe letter also notes that transgender students must still be protected from bullying. \n“All schools must ensure that all students, including LGBT students, are able to learn and thrive in a safe environment,” the letter said. \nTM and © Copyright 2017 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
