Embiid explained his extended absence by saying “I’m not healthy,” but added, “today’s the best day I felt in the past two weeks.” \nWhile Embiid has been a beloved phenom in Philly, fans missing his presence on the court were not happy seeing video of the fun-loving 22-year-old dancing onstage at a Meek Mill concert Friday night. Here's Joel Embiid dancing shirtless on stage to 'Wicked.' Enjoy. pic.twitter.com/ZoDouGkHAO \n— Sports Illustrated (@SInow) February 11, 2017 \nCoach Brett Brown said he spoke to Embiid about that and more on Saturday. \n“The conversations I had with Joel after I saw the video included a lot, some of which you mentioned,” Brown told reporters. “By and large, I’d probably prefer it was a private conversation.” \nEmbiid hasn’t played since Jan. 27, when he had 32 points, seven rebounds, four assists and two blocks in a nationally-televised 123-118 home loss to James Harden and Houston. Embiid is averaging 20.2 points and 7.8 rebounds in 31 games after sitting out his first two seasons with a foot injury. The 76ers entered Saturday 13-18 with Embiid in the lineup and 6-16 without him. \nEmbiid wasn’t selected as a reserve to the Eastern Conference’s All-Star team, and Colangelo said he likely won’t compete in the Rising Stars game and the Skills Challenge. \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T08:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T04:17:37.355+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
