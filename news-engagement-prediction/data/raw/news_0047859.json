For me personally, that would be the reason to stay on the show.” \nThen Ziegler brought up the elephant in the room: Yiannopoulos and his getting Wilmore’s goat and the former Nightly Show host momentarily losing his composure. “I was stunned that Milo was worthy of a one-on-one interview with Bill Maher to start the show,” Ziegler would confess. Wilmore, though, would put things in perspective: “It’s not that big of a deal. He’s sitting down on a comedy show, at the end of the day.” \nMoving on to the “You can go fuck yourself” heard ’round the world, Ziegler asked for Wilmore’s version of it. “I mean, come at me with something better. Stupid is the last thing you would describe me as. If he’s gonna call me unfunny, at least that’s subjective.” He would go further, saying that he was simply defending himself (and his fellow panelists): “I’m thinking, ‘Motherfucker, you’re gonna call me stupid? Let alone Malcolm Nance ?’ I mean, anyone on that panel you can’t make that charge. I just felt that charge was ridiculous.” \nStraying from the topic of the polarizing Breitbart editor, Ziegler pressed Wilmore about his thoughts on how comedians are handling the Trump Era, commenting that he was “taken aback by how much comedians cared” about the welfare of the country. Wilmore would demure, “Well, sometimes I’d say what’s bad for the country is good for my business unfortunately.” The two would touch on specific comedians — Colbert, Bee, Oliver — and their ways of handling the current presidency. \nEventually they would make their way around to Wilmore’s short-lived Comedy Central talk show The Nightly Show . Briefly touching on the how’s and why’s of Show Biz (in regards to why the show was canceled), Ziegler had a more pressing observation, “Let me ask you about your voice. I thought the Larry Wilmore I saw on the Nightly Show was different from the Larry Wilmore I knew from the Daily Show.” Wilmore agreed, again, pointedly commenting on the fact what you see on TV isn’t always true to life: “That’s a fair assessment. I would consider myself more a passionate centrist. Doing a TV show is different because it’s more of a TV version of something. A more focused take on things.” \nRounding out the hour was a brief — and lighthearted — conversation on why African Americans didn’t turn out for Hilary. “Now you’re gonna blame Trump on black people,” Wilmore joked with his long-time friend. \nListen to the hour-long conversation above, via Free Speech Broadcasting. \nHave a tip we should know?
