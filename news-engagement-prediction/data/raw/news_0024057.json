Unforgotten , however, demonstrated that genre need not be a straitjacket. \nIf anything this superlative six-parter was straightforward drama where the protagonists were people first, cops and criminals a distant second. Having built a labyrinth over five episodes, creator Chris Lang spent last night meticulously writing his way out of it towards a bold climax. \nThe results were first-rate, in particular given that the key to the murder of David Walker lay in historic sexual abuse, the pre-eminent fallback for any modern policier. But, while most procedurals would exploit the theme for a quick two-hour hit – even Line of Duty, which dealt with the subject pretty carefully, prioritised its obligations as a thriller – Unforgotten addressed the human consequences, in a measured, thoughtful manner. Sanjeev Bhaskar as Sunny Credit: ITV \nT he reveal – that there was not one, but three corpses and three killers, after Colin, Marion and Sara (Mark Bonnar, Rosie Cavaliero and Badria Timimi, all terrific) had arranged to murder each other’s abusers – would have felt far-fetched had the ground not been so painstakingly prepared. \nIt’s rare to find such a plot moving so satisfyingly to its conclusion, with every nuance counting and every actor getting their moment along the way. Not a false note was struck, from detectives Cassie and Sunny (the always watchable Nicola Walker and, cast effectively against type, Sanjeev Bhaskar), to the suspects, to Wendy Craig and Bill Paterson, who feast on their small but crucial roles as parents nursing long-buried secrets. \nThe tiny details only added to the mounting horror: Marion’s memory of The Onedin Line’s theme tune playing the first time her father abused her; Colin’s recollections of the grooming that began with roast dinners and ended in a tent in the woods. These were not attempts to wriggle off the hook, rather purges of demons kept inside for decades, the victims refusing to be defined by their pasts any longer. Mark Bonnar as Colin Osbourne Credit: ITV \nI n the end, with any sense of triumph over cracking the case long-dissipated, Cassie and Sunny decided not to pursue the culprits, for both procedural and moral reasons. \n“Why do we send people to prison?” they asked each other. “Do Colin, Marion and Sara need to be punished?” \nThe answer was an unequivocal no, and so the three murderers were left to piece their lives back together while I breathed a sigh of relief. Bad policing, perhaps, but the perfect ending.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:06:22.422+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
