However, she added that there are caveats. JUST WATCHED Study: This diet could lengthen life Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH \nStudy: This diet could lengthen life 02:37 The easy-to-follow Mediterranean diet involves eating mostly vegetables, fruits, legumes, unrefined grains, olive oil and fish. Though the diet also includes skim or low-fat dairy products, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children consume whole milk until age 2, Johnson said. Read More Nuts are also included in the Mediterranean diet, but the academy considers whole nuts to be a high-risk food for choking and recommends caution for children under age 4, Johnson said. And, though the Mediterranean diet includes a modest amount of wine, alcohol is illegal to consume until age 21 in the United States. With those caveats, however, how exactly might a Mediterranean diet benefit children's health? And how can parents get their kids eating Mediterranean? Here are some of the latest findings and tips from experts. How a Mediterranean diet can be kid-healthy In adults, the Mediterranean diet has been linked to improved brain , heart and bone health ; longer life ; and a lower risk of breast cancer and type 2 diabetes . For children, some studies suggest that the diet might be associated with a reduced risk for obesity , asthma and allergies ; there might also be an association between not eating the diet and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

The study, which was conducted in Mexico, compared the health of 24 obese children who were assigned to eat a Mediterranean-style diet with 25 who were assigned to eat a standard diet over a 16-week period. \"These results further support the importance of introducing a Mediterranean-style diet to at-risk populations,\" the researchers wrote. Another study, presented at the European Congress on Obesity that year, found that children who consumed a Mediterranean diet were 15% less likely to be overweight or obese than those children who did not.

Previously, parents of high-risk children had been advised to delay their introduction of peanuts. Hide Caption 1 of 6 Photos: Six ways to reduce allergy risk in kids Some studies have linked certain objects or behaviors to the possible reduction of allergy risk. One new paper, for instance, suggests that children who suck their thumbs or bite their nails may have reduced risk of developing allergies. Hide Caption 2 of 6 Photos: Six ways to reduce allergy risk in kids Many medical authorities, such as the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, recommend breast-feeding , as breast milk provides important vitamins and nutrients to an infant. Some research shows that breastfeeding for at least four to six months may strengthen a baby's immune system and, as a result, be helpful in avoiding allergies. Hide Caption 3 of 6 Photos: Six ways to reduce allergy risk in kids Children's risk for developing allergies and asthma may be reduced when they are exposed to a pet, such as a dog or cat, in the household early in infancy . Researchers suspect that early exposure to certain pet allergens or bacteria might strengthen the immune system. Hide Caption 4 of 6 Photos: Six ways to reduce allergy risk in kids Research suggests that exposure to air pollution during the first year of a child's life increases the risk of developing allergies to food, mold, pets and pests. Therefore, fresh air might help in avoiding sensitivity to allergens.

Some studies show that a diet rich in vitamin D, such as milk, eggs or mushrooms, is associated with a reduced risk of the baby developing allergies. Hide Caption 6 of 6 Other studies have explored how a Mediterranean diet might be associated with reduced asthma and allergy symptoms in children. Adherence to a Mediterranean diet tended to be associated with a lower occurrence of wheezing and asthma in a 2013 paper in the journal Pediatric Allergy and Immunology . For that paper, researchers analyzed seven epidemiological studies on Mediterranean-like diets and asthma symptoms that were published between 1960 and 2012. \"The results of the present meta-analysis show that adherence to a Mediterranean diet during childhood is a protective factor for 'current wheeze' and 'asthma ever,' but not for 'severe current wheeze' when considering all studies together,\" the researchers wrote in the paper. Fish oil's effect on health: Where do we stand? Additionally, a study of 695 children found that those whose mothers took fish oil supplements in the third trimester of pregnancy had a reduced risk -- by about 7 percentage points -- for wheezing, asthma or lower respiratory tract infections. The study was published last year in The New England Journal of Medicine . Fatty fish is a regular part of the Mediterranean diet. A small study published in the journal Pediatrics on Monday suggests that eating less of a Mediterranean diet -- meaning fewer vegetables, fruits and fish, but more junk food -- might be associated with a 7.07-fold higher risk of ADHD diagnoses in children.

Those nutrients also seem to play an essential role in the development of ADHD, she said. Yet other experts remain dubious that the new study provides support for the idea that a Mediterranean diet might play a role in ADHD development.

He was not involved in the new study. \"The hypothesis that those with ADHD would be less adherent to the Mediterranean diet is puzzling because it is well-known that, as a group, those with ADHD tend to be less adherent to many tasks and routines they are asked to do,\" Brown said. \"ADHD is essentially an inherited problem with the brain's self-management system.\" How to get your child to eat 'Mediterranean' For parents who would like to introduce a Mediterranean diet into their children's daily eating routine, Dr. Carolina Vidal, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins Medicine, offered a few tips. \"Slowly introduce fruits and vegetables, and present them consistently with the other foods they eat. Cutting out sugars and fast food meals and make those sporadic as opposed to a regular meal or snack is very helpful,\" she said. \"Sitting to eat with them and serving as a role model is the best way to introduce a Mediterranean diet.\" Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter .\nJohnson, the University of Vermont professor, offered similar advice. \"Be a healthy eating role model for your child. Let your child see that you enjoy eating healthy foods,\" Johnson said. \"Exposure to foods leads to a preference for those foods,\" she added. \"It can take up to 12 to 15 exposures to a new food for a child to develop a preference for that food. Ask your child to taste the food, and don't give up too soon.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T11:42:33.864+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
