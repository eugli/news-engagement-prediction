McGeary, who lost the title to Phil Davis at Bellator 163 , stopped Brett McDermott in the second round at Bellator 173 at the SSE Arena in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The Englishman overcame a back-and-forth first round — in which he was knocked down at one point — to batter “The Spartan” with heavy shots. He nearly put McDermott away in the first round after landing a devastating knee to his head, which smashed his nose. The damage to McDermott’s face was a concern between rounds, as doctors evaluated whether he could continue or not. Early in the second round — with McDermott’s eye nearly shut and several ugly cuts spilling blood — cageside physicians called an end to the bout at the 1:06 mark, due to a large cut over McDermott’s right eye. McDermott took the fight on three days notice. For the 34-year old McGeary (12-1), it was his eighth finish in the Bellator cage, and his fifth via TKO or KO. Meanwhile, in the co-main event, Ireland’s own featherweight upstart James Gallagher was able to breeze through Kirill Medvedovsky to the delight of his faithful. The 20-year old “Strabanimal” dominated the action on the feet before overwhelming Medvedovsky on the ground. He put the Ukrainian fighter away with a first round submission (rear naked choke) at the 2:53 mark to keep his record perfect (6-0). In earlier action, French fighter Alex Lohore came back from a one-sided first round to defeat veteran Colin Fletcher via a rear-naked choke. The end came at 2:42 of the second round.
