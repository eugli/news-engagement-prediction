The oil was running into a culvert near the city’s wastewater treatment plant.\nThe city initially referred to the incident as a spill, but provincial officials later stated the oil was deliberately dumped.\n“It’s hard to speculate, you know, why someone would do that,” said Wes Kotyk, with Saskatchewan’s Ministry of Environment.\n“In this day and age, everyone knows it’s not the right thing to do and it’s illegal to do that kind of thing.”\nCity crews and the Lloydminster Fire Department isolated the oil with sandbags before a vac truck and steamer began cleaning up.\nAbout 95 per cent of the oil was recovered Tuesday, with the remaining picked up Wednesday.\nThe Ministry of Environment says the environmental impact was minimal because the oil flowed into the concrete culvert. The wastewater treatment plant was unaffected and no public water advisories were issued.\nThe ministry is investigating alongside the Saskatchewan Water Security Agency and Lloydminster RCMP. If charges are laid and a suspect is found guilty, they could face fines up to $1 million for each day of oil cleanup.\n--- based on a report by Julie Clark \nPhotos Crews work to clean oil dumped in a ditch near the Lloydminster wastewater treatment plant.
