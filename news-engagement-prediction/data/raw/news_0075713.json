ISABEL INFANTES via Getty Images The NHS has mislaid more than half a million pieces of patients’ confidential medical correspondence \n“This is a very serious incident, it should never have happened and it’s an example of what happens when the NHS tries to cut costs by inviting private companies to do work which they don’t do properly,” he added. \nThe contents of the more than 500,000 misplaced messages ranged from blood and urine test results to cancer diagnoses. \nThe NHS is now spending millions of pounds assessing the scale of the situation and will probe whether the delays contributed to any patients’ deaths, The Guardian said. \nSBS, which is co-owned by the Department of Health and French company Sopra Steria, was operating a redirection service in the East Midlands, the South West and north-east London. Reuters Health secretary has 'serious questions to answer' over the 'cover up', Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron has said \nThe issue relates to patients’ documents not being forwarded after they were sent to practices where the patient was not known or had moved away. \nLiberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said: “This looks, to me, like a cover up. (Health Secretary) Jeremy Hunt has serious questions to answer. \n“This is a staggering loss of personal, private data. This colossal loss of vital material may well have crucially impacted on a patient’s treatment. \n“I worry that while all this correspondence – including test results - has gathered dust, patients been put at risk.” \n“People could have died as a result of this, and so we need to know who knew what and when.” \nShadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth described the “astonishing” failure as an “absolute scandal”. \n“Patient safety will have been put seriously at risk as a result of this staggering incompetence,” he added. \n“Jeremy Hunt now needs to tell the whole truth of why patient safety has been put at risk in this way.” \nAn NHS England spokesman said: “Some correspondence forwarded to SBS between 2011-2016 was not redirected or forwarded by them to GP surgeries or linked to the medical record when the sender sent correspondence to the wrong GP or the patient changed practice. \n“A team including clinical experts has reviewed that old correspondence and it has now all been delivered wherever possible to the correct practice. \n“SBS have expressed regret for this situation.” More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T15:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T10:58:58.273+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
