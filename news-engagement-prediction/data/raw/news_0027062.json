There is often a subtle division between those who can \"settle\" and reliably occupy the same desk every day, and those who cannot. \nSettlers arrive first, choose their preferred desk, and by repeating their choice over time, establish this desk as \"their\" space. Settlers can secure the best desk space (often near the windows), can furnish their desks with all the materials and equipment needed for work, and can sit near their closest colleagues. \nThese routines are advantageous. \nContrary to popular belief, these kinds of habits enable creativity because they enable us to put mundane matters (like finding a seat near to people we know) into the background and direct our attention onto problem-solving and innovation. \nEmployees who for various reasons (such as childcare responsibilities or part-time status) arrive later in the day don't have a similar choice of desk space. \nBecause some desks have already been taken, the staff to desks ratio is effectively increased. \nIf you find yourself in this situation, your search for a space, encumbered by your possessions, proclaims your uncertain status. \nThen, once you have found a free desk, you have to unpack all your work things and set yourself up before you can begin productive work (and then repack it all when you leave) – spending more time every day on low-level subsistence activity. \nYou will also be sitting regularly alongside relative strangers. \nIt's not acceptable to introduce yourself, because that would interrupt them. \nInstead, the normal manner is what sociologist Erving Goffman calls \"civil inattention\". \nThis is the practice of signalling to others nearby that you are not available for communication with them, despite your close proximity – it's the kind of manner most people adopt on a crowded commuter train. \nIn the workplace, this can feel incredibly isolating. \nAs one of my informants remarked: \"Every day could be your first day at work.\" \nIt does not indicate readiness for networking and collaboration. \nThis distinction between settlers and wandering hot-deskers has striking parallels with how vagrants move around a city, carefully giving priority to the settled \"host\" population. \nThe host population can occupy the prime space in the city, which offers comfort and pleasure, and indicates their high status (for instance, shopping, business and entertainment). \nVagrants must defer to the hosts, carefully observing when and how they might be permitted to enter the city's prime spaces, resigned to the fact that they will spend most of their time at the margins. \nThe analogy shouldn't be pushed too far: the problems experienced by hot-deskers are, of course, not anything like the awful hardship and marginalisation that homeless people have to cope with. \nBut the analogy helps to show the material and symbolic disadvantages that can come with a lack of ownership of space. \nIt also points to a wider situation where our ownership and occupation of space is becoming more temporary and tenuous. \nMany contemporary spaces are designed to be slippery – shopping malls have few benches and are security-patrolled to deter loitering; transport hubs have uncomfortable slanted seats that hurry us along. \nThere are even \"smart\" park benches that have been designed to tip the sitter off after the time permitted for relaxation has elapsed. \nThe plight of the hot-desker therefore forms part of a wider social issue where space is designed in a way that allows it to be used intensively by many different people. \nBut in so doing, it may deprive of us of the ability to put down roots with the places and people we encounter every day. \nAlison Hirst is Director of Postgraduate Research at Anglia Ruskin University", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T08:13:30.792+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
