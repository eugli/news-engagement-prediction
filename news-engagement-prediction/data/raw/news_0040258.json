The development would bring thousands of jobs and homes to east London and Essex \nMayor Sadiq Khan, in partnership with councils and organisations, has submitted the plans to Lord Heseltine, who is heading the Thames Estuary 2050 Growth Commission. \nMr Khan said: “London leads the way across the creative economy — from fashion to film, design to gaming, performing arts to the visual arts. It’s only right that we build on this success and transform the Thames Estuary into a world-class centre for creative production — leading global innovation, developing the talent of the future and cultivating world-changing ideas.” \nCreative and cultural industries contribute an estimated £35 billion a year to the capital. \nMore than three million people live in the development area, which includes Barking and Dagenham, Bexley, Greenwich, Havering, Lewisham, Newham and Tower Hamlets in London; Canterbury, Dartford, Gravesham, Medway, Swale and Thanet in Kent; and Basildon, Castle Point, Rochford, Southend-on-Sea and Thurrock in Essex. \nThe Thames Estuary scheme would be one of the biggest redevelopment projects since disused docklands were turned into the Canary Wharf financial hub in the Eighties.
